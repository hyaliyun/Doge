In 1863 it became part of the First Kentucky Brigade. Service The 5th Kentucky Infantry, initially recruited in Hager Hill, Kentucky, was organized October 21, 1861, at Prestonsburg, Kentucky and mustered in under the command of Colonel John Stuart Williams. The regiment saw action in eastern Kentucky early in the war serving in the Army of Eastern Kentucky under Brig. Gen. Humphrey Marshall. On October 20, 1862, Marshall disbanded the regiment in a field just outside Hazel Green, Kentucky and gave the men three choices: honorable discharge, reenlist in the new regiment, or transfer to one of the cavalry regiments. In May 1863, command of the army passed to Brig. Gen. William Preston and was moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, becoming a division in Lt. Gen. Simon B. Buckner's Army of Tennessee. Following the Battle of Chickamauga, the 5th Kentucky Infantry was transferred to the First Kentucky Brigade, remaining in that organization until the end of the war. The First Kentucky Brigade became part of the Atlanta Campaign on May 7, 1864, when they left their winter camps at Dalton, Georgia and took up positions on Rocky Face Ridge. The regiment became part of the fighting retreating force as Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman pushed the Confederates further back toward Atlanta. At the Battle of Dallas near New Hope Church, the First Kentucky Brigade made an unsupported charge, losing 51% of its strength. At the Battle of Jonesboro on August 31, 1864, the brigade was ordered to attack the entrenched federal position. At an unseen deep ravine, the attack came to a halt. The following day, the Confederates were overwhelmed when two-thirds of a Union Army division attacked and began to surround their positions. Many of the men of the 2nd Kentucky Infantry, 6th Kentucky Infantry, and 9th Kentucky Infantry were captured. The remnants of the brigade fell back and managed a successful defense against the Union assault, bringing it to a halt. On September 4, only 500 men were present for duty in the entire First Kentucky Brigade. That same month, the regiment was converted to mounted infantry. The regiment was engaged in delaying tactics during Sherman's March to the Sea, following him all the way to Savannah, Georgia, finally moving to Augusta, Georgia, in early 1865. The regiment's last engagement was on April 29, 1865, in a skirmish near Stateburg, South Carolina. The regiment was ordered to Washington, Georgia and surrendered on May 7, 1865.

Beverley Bell McLean by Yousuf Karsh, 1935 John Ross McLean, the 11th of 12 children of a Northern Manitoba minister and farmer, was born in the small prairie village of Ethelbert in 1905. He became a Canadian journalist and civil servant. In the latter role he served as the Commissioner of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in the 1940s, having previously been instrumental in the foundation of the Board the previous decade. Early years In the 1920s McLean studied at Brandon College, and then later at the University of Manitoba. After gaining his MA from Manitoba in 1927, he won a Rhodes Scholarship to Balliol College at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. After completing his academic career in 1931, he moved to work in the United States, for the Unemployment Relief Commission of Northern Illinois. In 1932 he returned to Canada, working for the Association of Canadian Clubs and also engaging in a journalistic career. He wrote for Saturday Night and Canadian Forum magazines, and in 1935 became the National Liberal Federation's editor of publications. National Film Board In 1936 he was appointed the personal secretary to the Canadian High Commissioner the United Kingdom, Vincent Massey. In 1938 Massey and McLean discussed how unimpressed they were by the standard of films produced by the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau. McLean had seen and admired the work of British documentary film-maker John Grierson, and suggested to Massey that he should persuade the Canadian government to allow Grierson to compile a report into its film-making activities. This report led, in 1939, to the formation of the new National Film Board, with Grierson in charge. In the same year that the NFB was established, Grierson hired McLean to serve under him as the Assistant Film Commissioner. After arguments with the government over the content of several films, Grierson resigned his position as Government Film Commissioner in 1945. During the turbulent postwar years, McLean succeeded Grierson as Commissioner, initially on an interim basis but from January 1947 as an official appointment. McLean was faced with several problems during his time in charge, including budget cuts, a reduction in staffing and conflicts with the dominant United States film industry. McLean's greatest problem, however, came from the government's fear of communism within the NFB. In an atmosphere of heightening Cold War tensions with a government minister suggesting that certain NFB employees were engaged in Communist activities, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation was instigated into communism at the Board. Several employees were deemed \\"security risks\\", but following the findings of the investigation, McLean refused to fire any staff members. He believed that the political beliefs of his staff were irrelevant as long as it did not interfere with their work. In December 1949, McLean was informed that his contract would not be renewed when it expired in January. Ralph Foster, then assistant commissioner, resigned in protest. Several other members of McLean's staff threatened to resign as well, but he dissuaded them from doing so as he did not want the NFB to be harmed. McLean's nephew, Grant McLean, had begun working as a film director at the NFB during his uncle's time there. Grant, whose own NFB career spanned nearly three decades, described his uncle as a very philosophic person who believed very much in the concept of film and public information. He went on to serve as interim Commissioner himself during the 1960s. Post-1950 In 1950, McLean moved to Paris with his wife and young son to head the film division at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a position he was to hold until 1957. He returned to Canada as a writer and broadcaster, contributing to a number of publications. Then in 1960 he assumed the post of research director at the Broadcast Board of Governors which later became the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), where he eventually took on the role of special policy advisor, a post he was to hold until he retired in 1973. Family Ross married Beverley Bell Cosh and they had two children, Digby and Yolande. In an interview with the Toronto Star, Digby was reported as saying that his father was intensely nationalistic, and that he was perhaps best known for having stood up to U.S. film interests during his NFB tenure. Yolande remarked that her father loved history, read voraciously and travelled widely, sometimes forgetting to tell his family his next destination. Fluent in several languages, Mr McLean taught himself French by translating the Bible. In later life, McLean suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died July 26, 1984 in Ottawa, several weeks after Beverley, who died on May 17 the same year.

His daughter, Jessica, isn't getting along with her stepmother, Amy, because she is not happy about her parents divorce. The next morning, Amy, Jessica and her brother David go on a game drive with Brian, a ranger, while Tom goes to the dam. While driving off-road, David asks the ranger to stop the jeep because he has to defecate. Brian grabs his rifle and escorts David to a nearby tree. They encounter two lionesses, backed by a lion behind them. One lioness attacks and David runs back to the car, where Brian sacrifices himself to save the others. The keys lost, Amy, Jessica, and David are trapped in the car and stalked by the lions, who devour Brian. Back at the lodge, Tom is informed of his family's disappearance, and attempts to contact Crawford, a professional hunter and guide, at the suggestion of the park rangers. Crawford refuses to help him, as he is a big five hunt guide, not a leader of search parties. The next day, after not being able to accompany the rangers in the air, Tom goes to see Crawford, and manages to hire his services at the latter's own price. Back in the car, David spots Brian's keys, and Amy retrieves them, only to wreck the truck when she drives the wrong way. Crawford and Tom look for signs of them while checking in on the rangers trail periodically, but the rain the previous night has washed away any tracks. When the rangers fly by without noticing them, Jessica gets out and tries to draw their attention. She fails and, along with Amy, is attacked by one lioness, which is killed by two native hunters. Amy and Jessica manage to sign well enough to convince the hunters that they need water, and one leads Jessica to a watering hole nearby. They hear a gunshot and rush back, where the second hunter had been attacked and killed off-screen by the remaining pride members. The first goes to find his friend, and Jessica provides Amy and David with water. Tom and Crawford locate lion dung, which indicates that it had eaten and was far away, before setting up camp. After dark, Tom and Crawford discuss lions at the fire, and Amy and Jessica discuss how she met Tom back in the car. The hunter comes back and is killed when the lion smashes through the window and drags him out. The next day, Amy, Jessica, and David resolve to survive with what they have and list what that is, and Crawford and Tom find the bones of one of the pride's previous victims. Crawford and Tom's trail goes cold and he says they'll pitch and start west tomorrow, with Tom disagreeing. Amy gets out of the car, having heard Crawford's car, and begins to call out. Crawford and Tom run to the top of the hill. Crawford senses something is wrong, but Tom rushes down ahead of him, and is confronted by the last lioness. Before she can kill him, Crawford shoots the lioness through the heart. Tom makes it to the car, but on his way up, Crawford is attacked and killed by the lion. Tom crawls under the car and Amy breaks open the gas tank, telling Tom, Jessica, and David to run when she says so. Amy draws the lion's attention, and they dash for a tree as it jumps into the car. Amy lights a cloth fuse with her lighter and causes the truck to explode and kill the lion. Tom believes Amy is dead, but she appears beside the fire, and they all head back to Crawford's car to return to the lodge as the camera focuses on the savannah grass.

It is dominated by the forested hill ranges of the Elm, Lappwald and Dorm as well as the region known as the Helmstedt Bowl (Helmstedter Mulde). View through the beeches of the Hochwald forest in the Reitling valley in the Elm Geography Location Location of the Elm-Lappwald Nature Park The nature park has an area of about and lies within the districts of Helmstedt and Wolfenb√ºttel. It is bordered to the west by the city of Brunswick and to the north by Wolfsburg. The A 2 motorway from Hanover to Berlin cuts through the northern part of the park. Within the nature park are the following hill ranges, landscapes and forests: *Elm *Lappwald *Dorm *Elz *Eiz *Helmstedt Bowl *Rieseberg and Rieseberg Moor *Kampst√ºh Forest near Lehre From a landscape point of view the nature park belongs to the Eastphalian Uplands. It is located between the highlands of the Harz to the south and the L√ºneburg Heath on the North German Plain to the north. Climatically the park lies in the transition zone between the maritime and continental zones. History Park history The nature park was founded in 1977 thanks to cooperation between the districts of Helmstedt and Wolfenb√ºttel and the city of Brunswick. The Elm-Lappwald Nature Park has since become part of the UNESCO and European Geopark of Harz‚ÄìBrunswick Land‚ÄìEastphalia. Geological history The last ice age ( the Weichselian glaciation) around 12,000 years ago deposited a layer of loess up to 3 metres thick in the southern part of the Helmstedt Bowl and in the entire Sch√∂ppenstedt Basin, on which fertile black and brown earths were formed. During periods of thaw, the ice sheets created the detailed shape of the land. A thick deciduous vegetation developed in the time after the ice age and covered the whole area of the present-day park. Their species matched the soil conditions. For example, in the northern part of the park oak and hornbeam woods alternated with beech and oak woods and with carrs on the wet, peaty areas (fens). In the southern part, beech forests predominated. Settlement history The area of the present-day nature park was already permanently settled in the 6th century BC, as evinced by the megalith graves. The settlement of this region by man changed the natural, vegetative cover, albeit the first settlers in the middle Stone Age, who were hunters, fishermen and gatherers, did not made any significant contribution to these changes. The hollows in the area with their deposits of loess soils encouraged early arable farming during the Stone Age. The dense woods were cleared very early on. The greatest loss of woodland occurred during the time of the great clearances (900 to 1200 AD), when the natural landscape was \\"brought under cultivation\\". Today place names ending in -rode, -h√∂rst and -feld go back to this time of settlement. The Cistercian monks of Mariental in particular established numerous 'clearance villages'. Abbenrode, Hemkenrode and Erkerode on the northwest slope of the Elm and Rotenkamp on the Rieseberg date back to that time. In the Middle Ages there were clearly more settlements in the region. Almost half of them were given up again by their owners and fell into ruin, becoming abandoned villages. There is a particularly large number of these in the Lappwald, on the Dorm and on the southwest slope of the Elm. With its good soils, the area continues to be used for arable farming. Since the Middle Ages the towns of K√∂nigslutter, Sch√∂ningen, Sch√∂ppenstedt and Helmstedt, all within the nature park, have been steeped in history. A key factor in the early development of Helmstedt (already established by 952) was its location on the trade route from Brunswick to Magdeburg, the present B 1 federal highway. Flora and fauna The Elm is the largest and most attractive beech forest in North Germany. Amongst the varied landscapes of the natur park are large areas of forest, moors, springs, lakes, heathland, salt meadows and chalk downs, rich in plant species. The park is home to over 800 species of plant, of which more than 10% are endangered. Birds, mammals and amphibians also occur in abundance in the nature parks habitats. The Reitling valley in the Elm and the Brunnen valley in the Lappwald have been described as \\"idyllic\\".:de:Naturpark Elm-Lappwald See also * List of nature parks in Germany References Sources *Naturpark Elm-Lappwald, fotografiert von Peter Hamel, Text von Hermann Gutmann u.

It is available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Gameplay Career mode MotoGP 09/10 features 4 modes with the first of them being Career Mode. Players take control of their career on and off of the track competing in races and hiring engineers, team managers and press officers to help further their career as a pro and ultimately win the MotoGP World Championship. Demonstrating their riding skills on the track through overtaking, slip-streaming and showboating will be rewarded with Rider Reputation points. Pushing too hard can be detrimental as collisions and crashes will reduce the reputation bonus at the end of each race. The more rider reputation points players earn, the more attractive they become to other manufacturers, sponsors, and employees. The player's team will also research upgrades for an existing bike to increase its performance. As players start off at the 125cc they can upgrade their team into the 250cc/Moto2 series and then ultimately into the MotoGP series. Career Mode has a limitless number of years allowing players to continue career mode indefinitely. Championship mode Players can race in 125cc, 250cc/Moto2 and MotoGP championships from the 2009 and 2010 seasons as it unfolds. The realistic AI will emulate true racing pack with different riding styles and pace making this a challenging mode for all GP fans. Arcade Players must show off their skill to stay in the race as they compete to finish a whole season in 125, 250/Moto2 or MotoGP class before running out of time. Each lap, clean section, overtake and top speed reached will reward players with more time but crashing off the track or getting overtaken will cause time to be deducted from the player's total and the chances of living the MotoGP dream will be over. Online Compete against other riders across the globe, in online multiplayer mode. There can be up to 20 bikes in a race.

Originating as a literary hoax, the names of both Botul and his philosophy of botulism derive from botulism, an illness caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.Jeandillou, Jean-Fran√ßois. Supercheries litt√©raires: La vie et l'≈ìuvre des auteurs suppos√©s. Geneva: Librairie Droz, p. 465. References to Botul were first made in publications by members of the association and later turned up in texts by writers who were not party to the hoax and thought Botul was a real person, notably the French philosopher Bernard-Henri L√©vy. There is now an annual Botul Prize awarded for a book that mentions Botul. History The hoax began in 1995, when Fr√©d√©ric Pag√®s, a former professor of philosophy and a journalist for the satirical weekly newspaper Le Canard encha√Æn√© (The Chained Duck), invented Jean-Baptiste Botul and his chief work, entitled The Sexual Life of Immanuel Kant. The general idea behind Botul and botulism was that philosophy is too vital to be left solely in the hands of professional philosophers. Various authors afterwards referred to this work‚Äîsome facetiously and some seriously‚Äîincluding the philosopher Bernard-Henri L√©vy, who quoted from it extensively in his 2010 book On War in Philosophy.Aude Lancelin, \\"BHL en flagrant d√©lire: l'affaire Botul\\". NouvelObs.com, Feb. 8, 2010.Gnouros, Oscar. \\"Apr√®s (et surtout avant) BHL, d'autres victimes de Jean- Baptiste Botul\\". Morbleu!, Feb. 15, 2010. L√©vy afterwards acknowledged that he had fallen for the \\"well-rigged\\" hoax. Fictional biography Pag√®s created a fictitious history for Botul, as follows: Botul was supposedly born on August 15, 1896, in the French village of Lairi√®re in the south-central Aude department. Affiliating himself with the oral tradition in philosophy, he left no official writings; instead, what is known of his thought comes from transcribed speeches and fragments of correspondence. He is said to have been a friend of the writer Marcel Proust and to have been engaged for a time to the politician and former spy Marthe Richard.\\"Botul n'existe pas, je l'ai rencontr√©!\\" L√†-bas si j'y suis March 2, 2010. Other famous people placed in his orbit include the writers Simone de Beauvoir, Lou Andreas-Salom√©, Marie Bonaparte, Jean Cocteau, Jean Giraudoux, Stefan Zweig, and Andre Malraux, and the Mexican revolutionaries Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.Roubaud, Jacques. \\"Botulisme et Oulipisme\\". La Biblioth√®que oulipienne 183 (February 2009). In 1946 he supposedly emigrated to Paraguay with a hundred German families fleeing the advancing Soviet armies, and there he is said to have founded a town, 'Nueva K√∂nigsberg', governed by the principles of Kantian philosophy.Landru, pr√©curseur du f√©minisme cited in Le Nouvel Observateur, Feb. 19, 2010 His death date is given as August 15, 1947. In his philosophical work, Botul is presented as an expert in the work of Immanuel Kant, with special attention to Kantian morality.

The association's founders are also known as the core boulien (Botulian core) and the NoDuBo. The association contributes to the creation of Botul's oeuvre. This includes most prominently The Sexual Life of Immanuel Kant as well as Nietzsche and the Noonday Demon; Landru: The Precursor of Feminism; and Soft Metaphysics. The first two of these have since been published by the French press √âditions Mille et une nuits. The association also organizes various annual events, including a banquet.

Edited by Saul Patai and Zvi Rappoport Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In the group 11 elements silver is the element below copper. The chemistries have much in common but organosilver catalysis is much less common (mostly academic study) than organocopper chemistry due both to the relatively high price of silver and to the poor thermal stability of organosilver compounds. The oxidation state for silver in organosilver compounds in exclusively +1 with the notable exception of Ag(III) in the trifluoromethyl silver anion Ag(CF3)4‚àí because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl groups. Poor thermal stability is reflected in decomposition temperatures of AgMe (-50 ¬∞C) versus CuMe (-15 ¬∞C) and PhAg (74 ¬∞C) vs PhCu (100 ¬∞C). The first attempts in organosilver were recorded by Buckton in 1859 and by J. A. Wanklyn & L. Carius in 1861. The first synthesis of an organosilver compound (methyl silver) was described by Semerano and Riccoboni in 1941. Compounds Phenylsilver can be obtained by reaction of silver nitrate with an trialkylphenyllead compound: :AgNO3 \\\\+ R3PhPb ‚Üí PhAg Alternatively, diphenylzinc may be used: :Ph2Zn + AgNO3 -> PhAg + PhZnNO3 The silver mesitylene adduct is a tetramer. it can be formed from silver chloride and the Grignard reagent: :AgCl + MesMgBr ‚Üí Ag4(Mes)4 \\\\+ MgClBr Silver forms stable complexes with ylides such as triphenylphosphonium methylide: :AgCl + Ph3P=CH2 ‚Üí AgCl(Ph3P=CH2) The C-Ag bond is stabilized by perfluoroalkyl ligands: :AgF + CF2=CF(CF3) ‚Üí AgCF(CF3)2 Alkenylsilver compounds are also more stable than their alkylsilver counterparts. Vinylsilver can be obtained by reaction of silver nitrate with tetravinyllead: :AgNO3 \\\\+ (CH2=CH)4Pb ‚Üí (CH2=CH)Ag + (CH2=CH)3PbNO3 Silver-NHC complexes are easily prepared, and are commonly used to prepare other NHC complexes by displacing labile ligands.

Silver nitrate is used to separate out alkenes as the Œ∑2-alkene complex.

Based on the 1928 story of the same name by Abraham Merritt, it stars Thelma Todd, Creighton Hale, William V. Mong and Sheldon Lewis. It was first released as a silent film and later as a part-talkie. Plot Jim and Eve, a young society couple, are kidnapped on the eve of Jim's departure for Africa and brought to a mansion that is home to a strange and glamorous Satanic cult. Jim is put through a number of strange adventures in the old house and tries to maintain his courage. During the course of the film, Jim encounters an old witch, a dwarf, a gorilla and a strange shaggy creature called \\"The Spider\\" (played by Sheldon Lewis). In the end, he is confronted by Satan himself who puts him to a final test. It is revealed to be a hoax played on Jim and Eve by their friends to test their courage.

The screenplay was written by director Benjamin Christensen under the name Richard Bee. Initially overjoyed that his story would be adapted into a film, Merritt later spoke about the film in a 1933 interview, stating that he \\"sat through the picture and wept. The only similarity between the book and the picture was the title. The picture likewise killed the booksale [...] for people who saw the picture felt no impulse thereafter to read the book.\\" Christensen cast actor Creighton Hale in the role of Jim in an attempt to capitalize on Hale's having starred in The Cat in the Canary, an earlier similar \\"old dark house\\" film. Release The silent version of the film was released on 27 January 1929 while a version with sound was released on 17 February 1929. The original running time of Seven Footprints to Satan is in question. In his book Thrills Untapped: Neglected Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Films, 1928-1936, Michael R. Pitts noted that most contemporary reviews stated the film had a 60 minute running time seemingly referring to the sound version of the film. The silent release is listed at being 168 feet shorter than the sound release, with a restored silent version running at around 77 minutes. Pitts described the film as a \\"box office flop\\", with a gross of $129,950. Critical response Pitts described that contemporary critics were overall \\"not impressed\\" with Seven Footprints to Satan. A review in Film Daily described the film as a \\"has of weird and wild doings in a mysterious house with a lot of phony thrills.\\" Movie Age opined that \\"Maybe we haven't seen all the so- called mystery-drama-thrillers so far released, but of those what we have seen, this Seven Footprints to Satan is one of the poorest. There is not a convincing situation in it, and the explanation of it all at the end takes the cake...no rhyme or reason.\\" A review in Variety similarly called the film \\"all hokum\\", noting \\"another of those fright producers, wholly baffling from start to finish. An utterly moronic sound film appearl to all the passions.\\" One reviewer in Photoplay stated that they loved the title of the film but found it \\"just a hodgepodge mystery story\\" A review in Harrison's Reports commented that \\"People will no doubt enjoy this picture provided they don't take it seriously.

The series aired on BBC One, and moved from Tuesdays to Thursday nights. Reception On 22 November 1999, three days before the series premi√®re, then director of Channel 4 Gub Neal called for the BBC to cease production of its drama programmes. Neal highlighted Holby City as an example of the station's \\"safe\\" programming, denouncing what he perceived to be the abandonment of quality productions in favour of star-led series and \\"an endless soup of indistinctive programmes\\". The Daily Mail Jaci Stephen echoed Gub's concerns, writing that the excessive salaries paid to star-names had resulted in a dilution of overall talent, and the rise of \\"shallow, cliche- ridden drama, the success of which is dependent upon little more than an undemanding audience's lack of intellectual ambition.\\" Stephens wrote that: \\"Nowhere is this more obvious than in Holby City, where doctors and nurses outnumber patients by about 25 to one.\\" She criticised the storyline which saw Kirstie potentially infected with HIV following a needle stick injury, contrasting it negatively to similar storyline on Chicago Hope. Stephens concluded that the series was just \\"sentimental, simplistic tosh.\\" Reviewing \\"Search for the Hero\\", The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith commented on the series' casting: \\"I had the uneasy sensation that I had met half these people before in assorted soap operas. If I am having an emergency Caesarean in economy class, the last person I want to see at the other end of the cleverly improvised coathanger is Cindy's fancy man from EastEnders.\\" Fellow Guardian critic Adam Sweeting criticised the series' writing, observing: \\"In Holby, no clich√© need ever fear being denied admittance.\\" Natasha Joffe too was critical of the series' writing, opining that Holby City seemed \\"a bit soggy\\" following Nick's departure, and criticising the \\"Casualty-esque love of didactic plot mirroring\\" between the doctor and patient storylines. By February 2000, Holby City had become the only new drama series under BBC One controller Peter Salmon to average more than 9 million viewers. The series saw Griffin win the \\"Best Actress\\" award at the 2000 Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards for her role as Jasmine.

The series also introduced Clive Mantle as general surgical consultant Mike Barratt, Jan Pearson as ward sister Kath Shaughnessy, Jeremy Edwards as Kath's son, healthcare assistant Danny Shaughnessy, and Thusitha Jayasundera as general surgical registrar Tash Bandara. Mantle had previously played the same character in Casualty. French departed from the show during the course of the series, and Preston and Curtis did not return for series three. French attributed his departure to the programme becoming \\"uninteresting and formulaic\\", commenting: \\"There should be drama on television which is constantly challenging the audience.

Joseph Huddart, in a Chinese reverse glass painting from c. 1785-9. Joseph Huddart FRS (1741‚Äì1816) was a British hydrographer, engineer and inventor. He surveyed harbours and coasts but made a fortune from improving the design and manufacture of rope. He was highly regarded in his time, and his likeness featured in an engraving of distinguished men of science. Huddart was chosen to feature in the central group of the picture with M. I. Brunel, James Watt, Matthew Boulton and Thomas Telford. Biography Huddart was born at Allonby in Cumberland. Huddart's father was both a shoemaker, a farmer and a fish smoker. Huddart's natural talents were mathematics and mechanics. Huddart had built models of a mill and a ship of war merely from descriptions he had read about. He initially joined his father's fish processing business. His father had taken advantage of an unusual occurrence and joined with others to start the Herring Fishery Company. Shoals of fish had arrived in the Solway Firth and there was a profit for any who could preserve the fish for export., access-date=February 2010 In 1762 his father died and Huddart inherited his father's share of the fish processing business. The following year Huddart married Elizabeth Johnson. He took the role of captaining a brig which was used to trade along the Irish coast selling smoked fish for resale to the West Indies. Six years later he built an improved ship and studied the arts of surveying and navigation. Navigation In 1771 he was introduced to Sir Richard Hotham, who had also come from humble beginnings. Hotham had influence with the East India Company and Huddart was related to Hotham by his marriage to one of Huddart's uncle's daughters. In 1778 he started out on four voyages to the east, eventually in command of the East Indiaman Royal Admiral for her maiden and two subsequent voyages. He completed surveys of the coast of India and Sumatra. From 1788 he completed surveys of the Hebrides and in 1791 he became a fellow of the Royal Society and joined the management of Trinity House as an elder brother. He took charge of enquiries regarding light, lighthouses and charts and he supervised and directed the construction of the Hurst Point Lighthouse. Huddart's guide to navigation to China and New Holland was published in 1801. Rope manufacture He spent some time studying and improving the techniques for manufacturing rope. He was able to improve the strength and reliability by improving the distribution of the stress equally amongst the fibres of the cable. He employed steam power to automate the production of rope. Huddart set up Huddart & Co. of Limehouse to manufacture rope, with Charles Hampden Turner, Sir Robert Wigram and John Woolmore as partners. He became rich from the sale of this improved rope, and in both 1809 and 1811 he purchased estates in Wales. Huddart died in London in 1816 having fathered five sons. He was buried under St.Martin's-in-the-Fields in his uncle's vault. The institute of Civil Engineers had a copy of his portrait by John Hoppner. In 1865, William Walker published a book based around an engraving showing the \\"distinguished men\\" of 1807‚Äì8. The engraving included about fifty people and Huddart was chosen to feature in the central group with M. I. Brunel, James Watt, Matthew Boulton and Thomas Telford.Review of 1989 Huddart Biography, Susanna Fisher, JStor.

At the same time, it expected Iraq to comply with its obligations under international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, relating to the safety and detainment of third-state nationals in Iraq and occupied Kuwait. The Council then requested the Secretary-General to urgently seek information on the availability of food in Iraq and Kuwait, as well as paying attention to children, the elderly, expectant mothers and the sick, communicating all information to the Committee. If the Committee found an urgent humanitarian need for foodstuffs, it was to report to the Council promptly with its decision as to how the need should be met. Furthermore, the Committee was directed to bear in mind when formulating its decisions that foodstuffs should be provided through the United Nations in co-operation with appropriate humanitarian agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure the intended beneficiaries were reached. Finally, the resolution recommended the strict supervision of medical supplies by governments and humanitarian agencies exporting to Iraq and Kuwait.

It was built in 1868, and the engine reconfigured in around 1925. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Location Stalybridge is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the course of the River Tame and the Huddersfield canal, on undulating land in the foothills of the Pennines. Historically a part of Cheshire, it is east of Manchester city centre and northwest of Glossop. The road from Oldham, to the pennine passes: the Snake pass and Woodhead, bridges the river at this point. Stalybridge was the junction of three early railway companies. The Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway Company was formed on 19 July 1844 and the railway was connected to Stalybridge on 5 October 1846. On 9 July 1847 the company was acquired by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. On 1 August 1849 the Manchester, Stockport and Leeds Railway connected Stalybridge to Huddersfield and later to Stockport. This line later became part of the London and North Western Railway. History Farming and woollen spinning were the main means subsistence before the construction of a cotton mill in 1776, Stalybridge became one of the first centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The 19th-century wealth of the town was built on the factory-based cotton industry, transforming an area of scattered farms and homesteads into a self-confident town. The 1776 mill was first water-powered; built at Rassbottom for carding and spinning cotton. In 1789 the town's first spinning mill using the principle of Arkwright's Water-Frame was built. By 1793 steam power had been introduced to the Stalybridge cotton industry and by 1803 there were eight cotton mills in the growing town containing 76,000 spindles. There was opposition and serious disturbances in town between November 1811 and April 1812 during the Luddites uprising. The social unrest did not curb the growth of Stalybridge. By 1814 there were twelve factories and by 1818 the number had increased to sixteen. When the Chartist petition was rejected, the ensuing disturbances known as the Plug Riots started in Stalybridge. Stalybridge mill was built in 1868, during the first joint-stock company boom immediately after the cotton famine had ended. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Stalybridge Mill, Stalybridge was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. Architecture thumb This was a six-storey mill, with a centrally placed engine and rope race. There was one six-storey extension, and a three-storey extension on the same wall as the water tower. Power It was originally driven by 1000 hp twin tandem compound engine by Goodfellow and Matthews built in 1868. It had a 30-foot flywheel with 27 ropes, which operated at 55rpm. It had two 22\\"HP and two 42\\"LP cylinders with a 6-foot stroke. The air pumps were driven by lever from crossheads with guides between HP and LP cylinders. This had Corliss valves on all cylinders and was steamed at 80psi. The HP cylinders were to the front. It was rebuilt in 1925(?) by Scott & Hodgson as a 1600 hp engine. This engine had slide valves on the LP which were now at the front. The HP cylinders had Corliss valves; they were steamed at 120psi, by four Lancashire boilers, An economiser was used. Marine type connecting rods and trunk guides were fitted. Equipment It operated 75,000 spindles in 1887, rising in 1891 to 87,000 spindles, 348/388 twist, 408/528 weft.

Career Publication of Einstein's theories Lucien Fabre's Einstein book from 1921 with a fake \\"pr√©face de M. Einstein\\". Fabre was a businessman, artist, and friend of the poet Paul Val√©ry, Leon-Paul Fargue, and the violinist Jacques Thibaud. He associated with socialists, particularly L√©on Blum; in Carmaux he met Jean Jaur√®s, a socialist politician from the same region as Fabre. Fabre married a young woman of one of the richest families of the Champ de Mars in Paris. During 1921, Fabre published a popular science book titled Einstein's theories: a new face in the world with a \\"foreword\\" attributed to Albert Einstein. The preface text was taken from a letter by Einstein to Maurice Solovine, which was later purchased by Fabre. After publication, Einstein complained to the editor, resulting in the preface of the book being withdrawn for the second edition (1922), and replaced with a derogatory comment directed at Einstein Albert Einstein, ≈íuvres choisies, tome 4 : Correspondances fran√ßaises, () Fabre is now largely forgotten, probably because of his extreme eclecticism which is no longer popular; a characteristic which made his style difficult to read. He kept all his life an affection for country life. Several of his books recreate the atmosphere and character which prevailed in this austere and poor land.

Go Green formed when Stenton returned from living as an exchange student in Brazil. In 2006, while looking for musicians to start a project, he met Tollefsen while she was playing with Spy Machine 16, and the two began writing music while attending the University of Guelph. Squance, also from Spy Machine 16 and Andrade quickly joined the band and a first gig was booked at the Albion Hotel almost right away. Later that year after Andrade sustained a drumming injury, Scott was asked to join to take over drums, leaving Andrade to explore other instruments. Green Go gained notoriety by playing intense house parties in Guelph, Ontario. Guelph is known for a vibrant music scene, with bands like Green Go being formed during a noticeable wave of independent live music in that city in the mid-2000s. The band was a part of the Burnt Oak Collective of Guelph artists which included notable Guelph area musicians such as Slow Hand Mot√´m, Richard Laviolette, Chris Yang and Elbow Beach Surf Club. The rich Guelph music scene at the time also gave rise to prominent local bands The D'Urbervilles and The Magic. They play energetic dance music that includes a complex mash-up of elements from rock, punk, electro, no wave, and funk. Their music is performed entirely with live instruments, without a laptop or electronic click-track. After releasing their home recorded debut self-titled EP on Burnt Oak, Green Go began touring central Canada extensively and recording their first full-length Borders, which was released in April, 2009. Green Go have played shows with Shout Out Out Out Out, You Say Party! We Say Die!, Holy Fuck, Woodhands, Natalie Portman's Shaved Head, Think About Life, Arkells, Fischerspooner, Beast, Ruby Jean and the Thoughtful Bees and Thunderheist, among others. They have played at numerous festivals including Pop Montreal, NXNE, Hillside, Festival d'ete Quebec and Osheaga. In addition to their own recordings, the band has also released two EPs featuring remixes of songs by other Canadian indie rock artists, including Diamond Rings, The D'Urbervilles, The Rural Alberta Advantage, Gentleman Reg, Women and Born Ruffians.

The centre closed in 2018. In February 2019, the Morrison government announced plans to re-open the centre, after parliament had passed a bill known as the \\"Medevac bill\\" opposed by the Prime Minister and his party, allowing medical professionals to have a greater say in the transfer of sick asylum seekers from Manus and Nauru. Morrison cited the prospect of increased boat arrivals as the reason for re-opening it.  History  Temporary facilities for asylum seekers were established on Christmas Island at Phosphate Hill in late 2001. This temporary facility was found inadequate in terms of size, amenity and security. On 12 March 2002, the Australian Government announced the replacement of the existing temporary facility and the construction of a purpose designed and built IRPC on Christmas Island with a capacity of 1200 people. In June 2002, after a tender process, a contractor was appointed to design and construct the facility on a fast track basis. Due to the reduction in the number of boat arrivals in 2001 and 2002 (boat arrivals had reached the Australian mainland since mid-2001), the Australian Government announced on 19 February 2003 to scale back the proposed 1200 person IRPC to 800 places. The existing construction contract was terminated. In September 2003, it was decided to proceed with the construction of the centre with accommodation capacity for approximately 800 people; 416 housed in purpose-designed and built accommodation units, and a further 384 in basic contingency accommodation. Protests There have been several protests staged over conditions at the Christmas Island centre. In 2011, more than 250 detainees hurled rocks at staff and set fire to the accommodation block causing a substantial amount of damage. They were subdued by tear gas and bean bag rounds, one of the first times bean bag bullets have been used in Australia. The protest was against the conditions and length of time people are held there. In early 2014, about 375 detainees went on a hunger strike, seven stitching their lips together as a cry for freedom and a sign of solidarity for Iranian asylum seeker Reza Barati. Further unrest occurred in 2014 after mothers concerned about the living conditions at Construction Camp for their babies, had a meeting with immigration officials. The mothers were reportedly told \\"You will never be settled in Australia. You will be going to Nauru or Manus Island and that's the end of the story.\\" Following this message it was reported that the mothers started screaming and threatened to set fire to the camp and were arrested.Australian Human Rights Commission, National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention 2014, Inquiry team interviews with three language groups, File note, 15 July 2014. DIBP confirmed that following this arrest seven individuals made threats of self-harm and four committed self-harm. Ten mothers were placed on \\"guided supportive and monitoring engagement\\" under the PSP, requiring 24-hour surveillance by a Serco officer.C Hatswell, Assistant Director AHRC Inquiry Taskforce, Department of Immigration and Border Protection, Correspondence to the Commission, National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention 2014, 22 July 2014. On 9 November 2015, a riot began at the centre after the death of an asylum seeker. The man escaped the centre and was found at the bottom of a cliff. Those involved in the rioting included criminals facing deportation. Damage to the centre may be as high as $10 million. Detainees involved were flown to Perth and placed in a maximum security prison. Legal proceedings: 2014 On 26 August 2014, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria by law firm Maurice Blackburn on behalf of a six-year-old girl against the Australian Government, claiming negligence in providing health care for Christmas Island detainees. The girl claims to have developed a dental infection, stammer, separation anxiety and has begun wetting her bed while detained on Christmas Island for over a year., Injured Asylum Seekers Sue Australian Government The claim if successful could provide potential redress for over a thousand asylum seekers., Maurice Blackburn Class Action Christmas Island Asylum Seekers  Closure: October 2018  On 31 October 2017 there were 314 asylum seekers held in the centre. On 23 November 2017 it was announced that the Centre would close \\"within seven months\\". The facility was closed in October 2018. Re-opening announced: Feb 2019 In February 2019, the Morrison government announced plans to re-open the centre, after parliament had passed a bill known as the \\"Medevac bill\\" opposed by the Prime Minister and his party, allowing medical professionals to have a greater say in the transfer of sick asylum seekers from Manus and Nauru. Morrison cited the prospect of increased boat arrivals as the reason for re-opening it. The Shire Council President (Mayor) of Christmas Island Shire, Gordon Thomson, criticised the move, saying the announcement was \\"stunning\\" and \\"made no practical sense.\\" He told the media that Christmas Island has never provided medical treatment [to detainees] and this would have to be carried out on the Australian mainland. In April 2019, the Morrison Government paid for 140 Serco employees to be sent to Christmas Island, despite there being no refugees on the island. The same month, it was revealed the planned re-opening was going to cost $180 million. In May 2019, it was reported that 20 Sri Lankan asylum seekers were intercepted and brought to Christmas Island where they were held for a few days, and that their claims were denied and they were flown back to Sri Lanka within the month. Gordon Thompson said he had not been informed of this, and criticised the Morrison Government, accusing it of secrecy. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton denied that any asylum seekers had been detained on Christmas Island, but did say more than 10 boats from Sri Lanka had been turned back before reaching the island. Anthony Albanese, leader of the opposition Labor Party, sought a security brief from the Government on the matter. On the 30 of August 2019, a Tamil asylum seeker family were taken by chartered jet from detention in Melbourne, with the intention of returning them to Sri Lanka. A last minute court injunction prevented the removal of the family from Australia, and forced the jet to land in Darwin. The next day, an army plane took the family to the Christmas Island detention centre. Coronavirus quarantine: February 2020 On 29 January 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a plan to evacuate \\"isolated and vulnerable\\" Australian citizens from Wuhan and Hubei Province amid the coronavirus pandemic, taking them to the Christmas Island for quarantine for 14 days. On 31 January, medical experts were sent from Australia to prepare the centre as a quarantine facility. On 3 February, about 240 Australian citizens, including 84 children and five infants, were flown out of Wuhan on a Qantas evacuation flight to the Australian mainland and then flown on smaller planes to Christmas Island to spend two weeks at the \\"repurposed\\" facility. Another 35 Australians flown out of Wuhan on an Air New Zealand flight were transferred to Christmas Island from Brisbane. Facility Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre The centre was constructed on a site, formerly a phosphate mining lease, at the north-western end of Christmas Island, next to the Christmas Island National Park. The A$208 million centre was built by Baulderstone from January 2005 until August 2007, for the Department of Finance and Administration. It was finally completed in 2008.Australian Human Rights Commission (2012) Detention on Christmas Island\\" p.14, Retrieved 8 December 2017 ( PDF version-1.71 MB) It consists of eight accommodation units, education and recreation building, tennis courts and central sports area. Central facilities include induction/visiting area, main reception, administration centre, conference centre, kitchen, laundry and stores, medical centre and utilities building. External facilities include warehouse and visitor processing building. In 2009, the capacity of the centre was increased to 1800 places and in early 2010 to 2040 places. In February 2010, the Federal Government announced to further increase the capacity to between 2200 and 2300 places \\"within a couple of weeks\\". In April 2010 there were 2208 people in detention. In June 2013 a surge of asylum-seekers resulted in the detention facilities exceeding their designed capacity. Regular operating capacity is 1094 people, with a 'contingency capacity' of 2724. After the interception of four boats in six days carrying 350, the Immigration Department said there were 2960 \\"irregular maritime arrivals\\" being held. Serco, a private contractor, manages the operations of immigration detention centres on behalf of the Australian government. Property services are provided by CI Resources, which also operates a phosphate mine on the Island.

M Engineering Dept, Western Electric Company, Inc. ‚ÄúDevelopment of Airplane Radiotelepone Set.‚Äù The Electric Journal May, 1919. Due to its many problems, primarily its inability to communicate with other radios, like its ground component the SCR-67 or the larger truck mounted SCR-108, over large distances, the SCR-68 quickly became obsolete. Nonetheless, the SCR-68 was one of the first steps towards developing more effective messaging between pilots and commanders, even beyond military usage. Capabilities The SCR-68 had a few distinct characteristics that separated the SCR-68 from other types of radio. The SCR-68 operated at 750 kHz (400 meter wavelength), using a long wire antenna reeled out behind the aircraft. It could receive and transmit messages over a maximum range of eighteen miles. The artillery observer (navigator) managed the SCR-68, receiving and relaying messages for the pilot. During World War I, most planes were two-person open-cockpit aircraft. Instead of communicating between themselves in the air, the pilot and the observer sent messages through the SCR-68 where the headphones would eliminate most outside noises. Like a private telephone line, the pilot and observer could communicate with each other; however, this action prevented the SCR-68 from receiving any transmissions.Hill, Biggin. Western Electric Aviation Radio Telephone- Report on tests made by Royal Air Force. Bureau of Steam Engineering. May 21, 1918. (Historical memo) Problems Advancements with the SCR-68 were marred by its flaws. Military tests by British soldiers reported the difficulty of getting the proper balance with the oscillating and control values. The SCR-68 range was reliable within a five-mile radius, a serious issue when the airplane needed to travel long distances. Another issue with the SCR-68 was the static noise that came from the ‚Äúripples‚Äù in the generator commutation. The noise was faint and was only considered a problem when receiving messages that exceeded 5 miles. It was later found that metal shielding placed around the wiring helped to prevent this problem. Origins The US Army pushed for better technology to gain an advantage in World War I. The US Army asked private American companies to build a device that would establish better communication between military aircraft and themselves. Western Electric developed the SCR-68 that met qualifications: the radio was condensed to a size that could fit inside the airplane, simple for an Observer to use in flight, and the antenna would not drastically affect the movements of the aircraft. Another problem in the past included a communication device that eliminated the most disturbances from engine noise; the SCR-68 provided that by including a microphone and a sound-proof helmet. By the summer of 1918, approximately 3,000 units were manufactured and distributed to the US Army. Parts Radio Set Inside the suitcase-shaped box BC-11A was the circuit apparatus used for receiving and transmitting messages. The dials were used to control the frequency of the radio. The flip paddle switched the radio from receive to transmit and vice versa. The dimensions of the box were 17 inches by 10 inches by 7 inches and weighed 21 pounds. Intercom The BC-10 (SCR-57) intercom control box for switching between onboard communication and ground communication. Antenna The A-21 retractable antenna was located in the rear of the aircraft and was expanded by the air observer while in flight. It could reel out to 300 feet in length, was made out of two copper wires and weighed 19.5 pounds. Depending on the amount of antenna allowed behind the airplane, the antenna functioned at a wavelength of 750 kHz.Schultz, Mike. Western Electric SCR-68 Aircraft Transceiver. Reverse Time Page. Generator The GN-1 wind-powered generatorLieut.-Col. Slaughter, Nugent H. ‚ÄúRadio-Telephone Development in Army‚Äù Electrical World, Volume 74 New York: McGraw-Hill, 1919. Pgs 340-343. was located on the braces of the landing gear, to gather adequate wind power and not hinder any other parts of the aircraft. The generator, as well as three 22.5 volt batteries located in the BC-11, provided a plate voltage at 300 volts and a filament voltage at 30 volts. The wind-powered generator was not very efficient, requiring the airplane to travel at fast speeds in order for the generator to work properly.

It was founded in 1732 by Matteo Ripa and is organized in 4 Faculties. It is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent and the main university in Italy specialized in the study of non- European languages and cultures, with research and studies agreements with universities from all over the world. It is one of the most prestigious universities in the world regarding Asian cultures and languages. History The Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli \\"L'Orientale\\" is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent. right Foundation The name \\"Orientale\\" is an indication to the origins of the institution. In the mid-17th century, the Manchus established the Qing Empire in China and started a remarkable period of openness towards the west. This included welcoming Christian missionaries and priests. One such person was the missionary, Matteo Ripa, of the Propaganda Fide, from the Kingdom of Naples, who worked as a painter and copper-engraver at the imperial court of the Kangxi Emperor between 1711 and 1723. He returned to Naples from China with four young Chinese Christians, all teachers of their native language; they formed the nucleus of what would become the \\"Chinese Institute\\" of Naples, sanctioned by Pope Clement XII in 1732 to teach Chinese to missionaries and thus advance the propagation of Christianity in China. The school buildings comprised the Complesso dei Cinesi located at the boundary of Capodimonte and the Rione Sanit√†. What was formerly a private palace had been converted into a monastery and church dedicated to Saint Francesca Romana. Under Matteo Ripa, the complex became a seminary for missionaries to China. The school also would educate experts for the Ostend Company in Indian and Chinese languages. Transformations starting in the 19th-century After the unification of Italy in 1861, the institution was transformed into the \\"Royal Asian College\\" and other languages such as Russian, Hindustani, and Persian were added to the curriculum. The original buildings also were used as a school for orphans in 1897, and in 1910 into the Elena d'Aosta hospital. The institution then became a secular school for the study of eastern languages in general, and then, over the course of decades, African languages and, indeed, all modern European languages. Today more than 50 languages are taught. Architecture and Decoration The main entrance to the institute has a frescoed coat of arms of the institute with a half bust of Matteo Ripa sculpted by Leonardo Di Candia. The domed church of the Holy Family of the Chinese (Sacra Famiglia dei Cinesi) was built in 1732, This reference says church opened in 1729. and refurbished in 1814. The single nave leads to a main altar with marble cherubs sculpted by Angelo Viva. The main altarpiece depicting a Holy Family adored by two of the first Chinese Seminarians (1769) was painted by Antonio Sarnelli.Celano, p. 380. Other paintings were by followers or pupils of Francesco De Mura, including his brother Gennaro. Four saints carved in wood were designed by Francesco Solimena. The Madonna della Misericordia was painted by Stanislao Lista. The sacristy has sculptures by Giuseppe Sammartino. Institutions The Orientale moved into its current headquarters, Palazzo Giusso, in 1932. However, like most universities in Italy, the IUO has no single main \\"campus,\\" but is spread around the city at a number of different sites. There are several buildings that make up the teaching facilities of the Orientale. These include Palazzo Giusso in the historic center of Naples; the large converted monastery of Santa Maria Porta Coeli near the Naples cathedral; and the new Palazzo Mediterraneo on via Marina. Palazzo Mediterraneo now houses CILA, an acronym for Centro Interdipartimentale dei servizi Linguistici ed Audiovisivi‚Äî the \\"language lab,\\" an award-winning facility that has satellite TV for international programming, an impressive recording studio, and computers for instant access to the Internet.

Better known as the GAP, the Golf Association of Philadelphia was founded in 1897 by members of Aronimink Golf Club, Merion Cricket Club, Philadelphia Country Club and Philadelphia Cricket Club. Its 150 member clubs are spread across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The purpose of the association is simple: to preserve, protect and promote the game of golf. History 1894 meeting On December 22, 1894, delegates from five clubs ‚Äì St. Andrews Golf Club, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Newport Golf Club, The Country Club (Brookline, Massachusetts), and Chicago Golf Club ‚Äì met at the Calumet Club in Manhattan to form the Amateur Golf Association of the United States (subsequently to change its name, first to The American Golf Association, then to the United States Golf Association). Less than a month afterwards the Essex Country Club and the Philadelphia Country Club were elected to membership, the sixth and seventh on the roll. GAP founded A little more than two years later, the Golf Association of Philadelphia was founded. It was America's first regional golf association. Once again the Devon Golf Club served as a spur. For it was on this organization's course that the first interclub team match in the Philadelphia area was played. On Oct. 15, 1896 a team representing Philadelphia Cricket Club squared off against Devon's top players. The Cricket Club won 22 to 12. The occasion was so thoroughly enjoyable (even the losers had a grand time!) that the appeal of interclub matches on a broader scale was discussed and embraced. The obvious outgrowth of such thinking was the formation of an association of local golf clubs to organize and administer these competitions. On Feb. 5, 1897, seven men gathered at the Market Street National Bank for the express purpose of founding the Golf Association of Philadelphia. Representing the Belmont Golf Association (soon to be reorganized into the Aronimink Golf Club) were Milton C. Work and Dr. Henry Toulmin. From Merion Cricket Club came Rodman E. Griscom and Walter E. Stephenson. Philadelphia Country Club's delegates were George D. Fowle and Isaac T. Starr. Samuel Y. Heebner alone represented Philadelphia Cricket Club, Alan H. Harris being unavoidably absent. Objectives and membership The objective of the fledgling association was simplicity itself: to promote interest in the game of golf and to regulate all competitions between member clubs. In order to join the Association, a club had to be formally organized, have at least nine holes of golf for its exclusive use, and belong to the United States Golf Association. At the outset four clubs - the four founding clubs - were named Associate Members of the Golf Association of Philadelphia. Most clubs which would follow were accepted into the association as Allied Members. The difference was significant: Associate Member clubs had the right to be represented at the annual meeting by two delegates, each with one vote. Allied Members, on the other hand, could send only one delegate to the meeting and he has no vote. Moreover, the Association's three officers - president, vice-president, and secretary- treasurer - could be elected from the rosters of Associate Member clubs. The same was true of the other two members of the Executive Committee. The annual dues were $25 for Associate Member clubs, $10 for Allied Members, the bargain rate doubtless a reflection of the latter category's powerless position in the scheme of things. With the passing of the years, this distinction between the two classes of membership would blur and finally, with a revision of the by- laws, be eliminated. First elections At an organizational meeting two months later, on April 5, 1897, George D. Fowle, Philadelphia Country Club, was elected the first president of the Golf Association of Philadelphia. Dr. Henry Toulmin, Belmont, was elected vice president, and Alan Harris, of the Cricket Club, secretary-treasurer. Named to join these three on the then five- man Executive Committee (it would become a seven-member body in 1901) were Samuel Heebner, of the Cricket Club, and Louis A. Biddle, of the Country Club and Merion. First matches Once the officers and Executive Committee were in place, little time was lost in launching the first interclub team matches. That year the Association's four founding clubs each fielded two teams, six players per team, for a total of 48 players in the \\"league.\\" Matches were played in both spring and fall. When the final tally for the year was in, Merion's 1st team and the Cricket Club's 2nd team were the winners. The only other competition in the Golf Association's first season was what was then called the Individual Championship Tournament, today known as the Philadelphia Amateur Championship.http://www.gapgolf.org GAP Team Matches The GAP Team Matches, originally known as the Interclub Matches, served as the basis for the founding of the Association in 1897. Teams compete in a four-team sectional round-robin format (which equates to three matches in three weeks). A total of 12 players per team compete with six players staying home and six traveling to the opponent‚Äôs club. Clubs are divided and placed in Divisions AA through F based on the previous year‚Äôs results. Playoff and Challenges determined the top divisions‚Äô clubs. It is believed that the GAP Team Matches are the single-largest golfing team competition in the country. Tournaments The Golf Association of Philadelphia conducts over 60 tournaments annually from April to October. The schedule features events available for players of all ages (Junior, Amateur and Senior) and skill level (championship and handicap). It also includes the Association‚Äôs four Majors: the Middle-Amateur Championship, Amateur Championship, Open Championship and Joseph H. Patterson Cup. At the season‚Äôs conclusion, GAP awards ‚ÄúPlayer of the Year‚Äù honors on four levels: Amateur, Junior, Senior and Super-Senior. It also acknowledges a Junior Sportsman of the Year, Volunteer of the Year and Distinguished Service Award recipient.

In 1996, Adonyev founded a new company, Joint Food Company (JFC), which became the leading fruit importing company in Russia. . In 2001, Adonyev sold his shares in the company. US court case Adonyev is currently challenging an old US conviction (relating to a US company which he co-owned in the early nineties), and is represented by Anthony Julius and Alan Dershowitz. The basis of the challenge is that the conviction was a miscarriage of justice, because no crime was committed. Main business activities Telecom In 2006, Adonyev founded Telconet Capital fund, which became the main shareholder of the telecommunication operator Skartel ‚Äì trademark Yota. Yota reached operational profit within the first five months and became the first provider launching mobile wimax (4G) in Russia. In 2008, 25% of the company was acquired by Rostec. In 2012, Yota was the first company in Russia to launch LTE. In 2011, Yota's division that developed high- technology mobile internet devices became Yota Devices, which developed the YotaPhone. Yota Devices subsequently separated from Yota. In 2013, Telconet Capital fund sold its shares in Skartel to Garsdale Services ‚Äì a telecommunication holding, controlled by Alisher Usmanov. The estimated value of the transaction is US$1.33 billion. Real estate and agro-business In 2013, together with businessman Sergey Rukin, Adonyev established Technologies of Greenhouse Growth ‚Äì a St Petersburg company. The company united two existing greenhouse plants in Moscow and Tumen regions, as well as a trading house, TTR Trade. It sold its products under the brand ‚ÄòROST‚Äô in the main retailers throughout Russia (including Metro, Paytyerochka, Diksi, Magnit, Lenta). More than US$100 million was invested into this project. At the beginning of 2017, Rukin bought out Adonyev's share in this business. In 2017, Adonyev was ranked 124th in the Forbes list with a net worth of US$800 million. but according to him in an interview sold his food company for $6.2 billion taking 50% worth 3.1 billion obviously also adding on the telecommunications world with a now f1 company yota Philanthropy Adonyev supports many cultural and social projects, the most significant of which include the following: Arts Stanislavsky Electrotheatre Stanislavsky Electrotheatre opened in 2015 after a full reconstruction and artistic restructuring under the supervision of the theatre director, theoretician, and educator ‚Äì Boris Yukhananov. Romeo Castellucci, Heiner Goebels, Konstantin Bogomolov, Philipp Grigoryan, Katy Mitchell, Teodor Currentzis, Theodoros Terzopoulos, Dmitri Kurlyandksiy ‚Äì are among the artists who have collaborated with the theatre. MusicAeterna choir The choir is under the supervision of renowned conductor, Teodor Currentzis. MusicAeterna was the first Russian orchestra opening the Salzburg Festival. DAU DAU is a large scale international film project by Ilya Khrzhanovsky. It is a significant collaboration between Russia and Europe, supported by international film funds and production companies (Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, Mitteldeutsche Medienf√∂rderung, Arte France Cinema, WDR/Arte Essential Filmproduktion, Eurimage, The Swedish Film Institute, and others). Teodor Currentzis, Marina Abramovich, Carsten Hoeller, Romeo Castellucci, Vladimir Martynov, Leonid Fedorov, Boris Mikhailov, Robert Del Naja, Brian Eno, Anatoliy Vassiliev, Nobel Prize winner David Gross, Fields Medal winner Shing-Tung Yau ‚Äì are among the artists and scientists who participated in the DAU project. The premiere is planned for the fall of 2018. Education Strelka Institute for Media, Architecture and Design Strelka Institute is a non-profit international educational project, founded in 2009 and located in Moscow. Adonyev co-founded the Strelka Institute with Alexander Mamut, and co-financed it between 2009-2014. Merab Mamardashvili Foundation The Foundation is aimed at studying and publishing the heritage of the outstanding Soviet philosopher and phenomenologist, Merab Mamardashvili. Salomon Maimon Heritage Foundation The Foundation is aimed at studying and publishing the life and works of Salomon Maimon, a German self-taught philosopher of Jewish descent from the 17th century. Charity Charitable Foundation Ostrova The charity offers help to people suffering from cystic fibrosis in Russia. In 2016, Adonyev received Philanthropist of the Year award. The award was established by the Ministry of Culture of Russia and is awarded to significant philanthropists for their support and financial aid to projects aimed at preservation of Russian cultural heritage.

She currently serves on the Board of Abzena. Prior to launching Biospring Partners, Michelle was a Managing Director at General Atlantic, a global growth equity firm based in New York. While at General Atlantic, Michelle launched their first life sciences investment platform and served as a member of the life sciences investment committee. Michelle served as a Board Observer for Ginkgo BioWorks and as a board member for PathAI and Immunocore. Michelle currently serves on the Trustee Advisory Board for Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center., Advisory Board for the Women‚Äôs Foundation of Boston, and the Board of Directors for Life Science Cares. In addition, she is a member of the Rockefeller University Council; a member of the Advisory Council for the American Museum of Natural History; a Co-Founding Member of the Bowman Fund, Brasenose College Boat Club, Oxford University; and a member of the World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders. Background Michelle Dipp was raised in El Paso, Texas and earned her MD and PhD from the University of Oxford; her dissertation was on pulmonary hypertension. Career After graduating from Oxford, Dipp went to work for Wellcome Trust in its private equity division. Wellcome was an early investor in Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which was founded in 2004 by scientist David Sinclair, venture capitalist Christoph Westphal, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel. The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme. The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of resveratrol. Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial but effective; the company raised $100 million in 2006. Westphal recruited Dipp to join Sirtris in 2005 and she became the Vice President of Corporate Development. Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million; Westphal remained CEO of the subsidiary and was also appointed senior vice president of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD). In 2008, Dipp worked with Westphal, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection. In February 2010, Dipp, Westphal, and Aldrich formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund. Prior to launching Longwood Founders Fund, Dipp was the senior vice president and head of the Centre of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris. Dipp took over as senior vice president of CEEDD; this made her the youngest senior VP in all of the world's top ten pharmaceutical companies. In August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space its offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them. The company held its IPO in 2012. GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010. In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued. In 2011 Dipp co-founded OvaScience, an in vitro fertilization services and company, with Aldrich, Westphal, and Sinclair, along with scientist Jonathan Tilly, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair. The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds. Dipp served as CEO from 2011-2016. In January 2015 Longwood and Dipp helped found Flex Pharma Later that year she was named as one of Fortune Magazine's \\"40 under 40\\" and was also named one of 187 \\"Young Global Leaders\\" by the World Economic Forum, In November 2016 Dipp and Longwood helped launch Axial Biotherapeutics, which aimed to modulate the gut-brain axis to treat neurological diseases; its strategy at launch was open with company considering developing drugs to influence the gut microbiota as well as probiotics; Dipp took a board seat. Dipp was appointed to the governing board of the Biotechnology Industry Organization‚Äôs Emerging Companies section in December 2013. By the end of 2013 she and Westphal had joined the approximately 100 overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; BSO overseers advise the Board of Trustees on various matters including fundraising. In October 2014 she joined the board of directors of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. By 2015 she had joined the board of directors of the New England Venture Capital Association. In October 2017 Dipp became the Managing Director at General Atlantic, a global growth equity firm based in New York.

Biography Born in Dillingen/Saar, Germany, Baron and her family fled persecution in Nazi Germany, illegally crossing the border into Luxembourg in 1939. In 1941 Baron's family sailed from Lisbon to New York and settled in the Bronx, New York City. By the time she graduated from the Staubenmiller Textile High School in Manhattan, Baron was avidly reading eastern philosophy, making increasingly abstract paintings and probably already experiencing the symptoms of claustrophobia and depression that would lead to a series of nervous breakdowns throughout her life. She married book dealer Herman Baron in 1950 which whom she had daughter Julie and son Mark. In the late 1950s Baron combined a variety of techniques and began making her first collages. Occupied with raising her two children and beset by psychological problems, Baron nevertheless exhibited her work and in 1969, the year of her one-person exhibition at Ulster County Community College, she began to make the box constructions that would become her signature. In the early 1970s, Baron established a studio and devoted her time and energy completely to her artwork until her death in 1987. Hannelore Baron was self-taught. Although her compositions are completely abstract, she considered them to be both personal and political statements. In her own words, Everything I‚Äôve done is a statement on the, as they say, human condition...the way other people march to Washington, or set themselves on fire, or write protest letters, or go to assassinate someone. Well, I‚Äôve had all the same feelings that these people had about various things, and my way out, because of my inability to do anything else for various reasons, has been to make the protest through my artwork... H.B. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s her work garnered critical acclaim, along with gallery and museum exhibitions in the United States, Europe and Japan. In 1995, her work was the subject of a one-person exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 2001 her work was the subject of a traveling exhibition curated by Ingrid Schaffner and organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. Her works can be found in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.

It is generally a process of moving parts wearing against each other to produce the last small bit of size and shape adjustment that will settle them into a stable relationship for the rest of their working life. One of the most common examples of break-in is engine break-in for petrol engines and diesel engines. Engine break-in A new engine is broken in by following specific driving guidelines during the first few hours of its use. The focus of breaking in an engine is on the contact between the piston rings of the engine and the cylinder wall. There is no universal preparation or set of instructions for breaking in an engine. Most importantly, experts disagree on whether it is better to start engines on high or low power to break them in. While there are still consequences to an unsuccessful break-in, they are harder to quantify on modern engines than on older models. In general, people no longer break in the engines of their own vehicles after purchasing a car or motorcycle, because the process is done in production. It is still common, even today, to find that an owner's manual recommends gentle use at first (often specified as the first 500 or 1000 kilometres or miles). But it is usually only normal use without excessive demands that is specified, as opposed to light/limited use. For example, the manual will specify that the car be driven normally, but not in excess of the highway speed limit. Goal The goal of modern engine break-ins is the settling of piston rings into an engine's cylinder wall. A cylinder wall is not perfectly smooth but has a deliberate slight roughness to help oil adhesion. As the engine is powered up, the piston rings between the pistons and cylinder wall will begin to seal against the wall's small ridges.Aircooled.Net. to Break In a New or Rebuilt Engine - Aircooled.Net, Inc. (n.d.).‚Äù (accessed January 21, 2010). Additionally older design engines had a flat lifter that was pushed by the camshaft lobes. It needs to spin during operation to avoid excessive wear to the camshaft lobe. At idle speeds on a new engine poor machining tolerances could prevent the lifter from spinning and destroy the camshaft. After 20 minutes of wear, or \\"self machining\\" at higher engine speeds they would typically be able to spin freely. In the past, the engine break-in period was very important to the overall life and durability of the engine. The break-in period required has changed over the years with improved piston ring materials and designs. In reference to small engines, the break-in period now (5-10 hours) is short in comparison with that of engines of the past. Aluminum cylinder bore engine piston rings break-in faster than those used on cast iron cylinder bores. Preparation There are important preparations which must be made before the actual process of running the engine. The break-in can take place either in the vehicle or on an engine stand. Each engine has specific preparation needs of its own due to factors such as the many different types of engine models, the vehicles it belongs to, and conflicting expert instructions. For example, each engine should be lubricated and run on oil specified by its designers which can be found in a manual.Road & Track 51, no. 11: 152. \\"Technical correspondence.\\"(accessed January 19, 2010). Process The main area of controversy among engine break-in instructions is whether to run the engine slowly or quickly to initiate the process. Those who promote raising the power settings steadily will recommend changing the engine setting from low to high powers as to not work the engine too hard and create excessive wear on the cylinder wall (which would require the pistons to be removed and wall fixed). Other experts disagree and believe that to start the engine at a high power is the best way to effectively set in the pistons. The following are examples of how the two processes can be carried out: Start high power Start with revolutions per minute (rpm) between 2500 and 4000, and run the engine for about 20 minutes while watching so that the oil pressure does not get too high, which is dangerous. After changing oil and checking that the engine functions, drive using lower power settings. A high power setting is relative to the vehicle type, so half as many rpm may be necessary if a car has a smaller cylinder wall. Start low power Revolutions per minute should be around 1500 rpm. Run for about half an hour while checking the oil pressure and there should not be any over-boiling of the engine's coolant, which is a combination of air, oil, and water. Once this initial step is completed, drive at varying speeds on the road (or stand) by accelerating between speeds of 30 and 50 miles per hour.AERA. \\"BREAK-IN PROCEDURES FOR REMANUFACTURED ENGINES.\\" (accessed January 23, 2010). Consequences The following are consequences of a bad engine break-in: * Oil will gather in the cylinder wall, and a vehicle will use much more of it than necessary. * If a ring does not set into the grooves of the cylinder wall but creates friction against them each time an engine runs, the cylinder wall will be worn out. * Unsuccessful setting of piston rings into a cylinder wall will result in the necessity of new engine parts, or the entire engine depending on how extensive the damage is. * Camshaft lobes wear down and are destroyed on flat type lifters in older engine designs. Modern versus older break-in regimens For many kinds of equipment (with automotive engines being the prime example), the time it takes to complete break-in procedures has decreased significantly from a number of days to a few hours, for several reasons. The main reason is that the factories in which they are produced are now capable of better machining and assembly. For example, it is easier to hold tighter tolerances now, and the average surface finish of a new cylinder wall has improved. Manufacturers decades ago were capable of such accuracy and precision, but not with as low a unit cost or with as much ease. Therefore, the average engine made today resembles, in some technical respects, the top- end custom work of back then. Engine design has changed and most engines use roller lifters not flat lifters. For some equipment, break-in is now done at the factory, obviating end-user break-in. This is advantageous for several reasons. It is a selling point with customers who don't want to have to worry about break-in and want full performance \\"right out of the box\\". And it also aligns with the fact that compliance rates are always uncertain in the hands of end users. As with medical compliance or regulatory compliance, an authority can give all the instructions it wants, but there is no guarantee that the end user will follow them. The other reason for shorter break-in regimens today is that a greater amount of science has been applied to the understanding of break-in, and this has led to the realization that some of the old, long, painstaking break-in regimens were based on specious reasoning . People developed elaborate theories on what was needed and why, and it was hard to sift the empirical evidence in trying to test or confirm the theories. Anecdotal evidence and confirmation bias definitely played at least some part. Today engineers can confidently advise users not to put too much stock in old theories of long, elaborate break-in regimens. Some users will not give credence to the engineers and will stick to their own ideas anyway; but their careful break-in beliefs are still harmless and serve roughly like a placebo in allowing them to assure themselves that they've maximized the equipment's working lifespan through their due diligence. The useful side effect of a \\"break-in at slower speeds\\" for vehicles is operator familiarization. An overly exuberant operator crashing the new vehicle hurts people, reputation and sales.

Main characters Mary Richards Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) is a single native Minnesotan who moves to Minneapolis in 1970 at age 30 and becomes Associate Producer of WJM-TV's Six O'Clock News. Her sincere, kind demeanor often acts as a foil for the personalities of her co-workers and friends. Lou Grant Lou Grant (Edward Asner) is the Producer (later Executive Producer) of the news. His tough and grumpy demeanor initially hides his kind- hearted nature which is gradually revealed as the series progresses. He is referred to as \\"Lou\\" by everyone, including Mary's friends, with the exception of Mary herself, who can rarely bring herself to call him by his first name rather than \\"Mr. Grant\\". He was married to Edie, but during the run of the show they separated and divorced. Murray Slaughter Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod) is the head writer at fictional television station WJM-TV in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is assigned to write the news stories for the station's nightly news broadcast, and makes frequent quips about Ted Baxter's mangling of his news copy, and Sue Ann Nivens' aggressive, man-hungry attitude. Murray is happily married to Marie (Joyce Bulifant) and has several daughters. In the show's later years, he and Marie adopt a Vietnamese son. Although he is a happy family man, he is forever in love with Mary Richards, whom he thinks is, in his words, \\"Absolutely terrific\\". He is protective of her and always concerned for her happiness and well-being. At one point, when Murray truly believes he is in love with Mary in a real way, Marie thinks he is going to leave her. Mary explains to her that she thinks of Murray as a best friend. This helps things settle down. In a season three episode, it is revealed that Murray is a compulsive gambler. When a snowstorm keeps Lou Grant from flying to Vegas, he holds a poker game that Murray reluctantly joins. Murray tries to write a novel; despite failing, he never gives up. He, along with Mary, Lou Grant and another nemesis of his, Sue Ann Nivens are fired from WJM-TV to boost sagging news ratings. Ironically, Ted, the one most responsible for the dismal ratings, is retained. He and Mary Richards are the only characters to appear in every episode of the series. Ted Baxter Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) is the dim-witted, vain, and miserly anchorman of the Six O'Clock News. He frequently makes mistakes and is oblivious to the actual nature of the topics covered on the show but, to cover for tormenting insecurity, he postures as the country's best news journalist. He is often criticized by others, especially Murray and Lou, for his many shortcomings, but is never fired from his position. Initially a comic buffoon in the series, Ted's better nature is gradually revealed as the series unfolds, helped along by his sweet, seemingly vague, but frequently perceptive wife Georgette. Rhoda Morgenstern Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) (1970‚Äì74) (Season 1‚Äì4, 6 & 7 Guest) is Mary's best friend and upstairs neighbor. She works as a window dresser, first at the fictional Bloomfield's Department Store, and later at Hempel's Department Store. Though insecure about her appearance, she is also outgoing and sardonic, often making wisecracks, frequently at her own expense. Like Mary, she is single. She dates frequently, often joking about her disastrous dates. Rhoda moves to New York City and falls in love after the fourth season, beginning the spinoff series, Rhoda. Phyllis Lindstrom Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman) (1970‚Äì75) (Season 1‚Äì5, 7 Guest) is Mary's snobbish friend and neighbor. Phyllis is a recurring character appearing in many episodes of the first two seasons, after which her appearances decline in frequency. She is married to unseen character Lars, a dermatologist, and has a precocious daughter, Bess (Lisa Gerritsen). Phyllis is controlling, egotistical and often arrogant. She is actively involved in groups and clubs and is a political activist and a supporter of Women's Liberation. Rhoda and Phyllis are usually at odds and often trade insults. After appearing in three episodes of season five, Phyllis moves to spin-off Phyllis. In that series it is explained Phyllis has been widowed. Discovering that her husband had virtually no assets and that she must support herself, Phyllis returns to her home town of San Francisco. Sue Ann Nivens Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) (1973‚Äì77) (Season 4‚Äì7), is the host of WJM's The Happy Homemaker show. While her demeanor is superficially cheerful, she makes judgmental comments about Mary, exchanges personal insults with Murray, and uses many sexual double entendres, especially around Lou, to whom she is strongly attracted. Recurring characters *Georgette Franklin Baxter was played by Georgia Engel. Georgette was the somewhat ditzy girlfriend (and later wife) of stentorian news anchor Ted Baxter (played by Ted Knight). Mary Tyler Moore described her as a cross between Stan Laurel and Marilyn Monroe.\\"She Even Gets Laughs on Her Straight Lines\\", TV Guide, Dec. 1973. She and Mary got along fantastically, and she helped to somewhat fill the void that Phyllis Lindstrom and Rhoda left in Mary's life when they left for San Francisco and New York City, respectively. :She made her first appearance at one of Mary Richards' parties. She worked as a window dresser at Hempel's Department Store in Minneapolis, Minnesota, along with Rhoda Morgenstern. Later, she worked for a car rental service, as a Golden Girl, and for Rhoda selling plants. :Georgette was devoted to Ted, and they would eventually marry in Mary Richards' apartment. They adopt a child named David (Robbie Rist), and later, she gives birth to a girl named Mary Lou, also in Mary's apartment. *Edie Grant (n√©e McKenzie) (Priscilla Morrill) was the wife of Lou Grant. She and Lou had been married for many years and had children, but in the 1971 episode \\"The Boss Isn't coming to Dinner\\", marital difficulties lead to Lou and Edie separating. Though they reunite by the end of the episode, they again separate during The Mary Tyler Moore Show's third season, with the marriage ending soon thereafter. In a later season, Edie was remarried to Howard Gordon, and asked Lou and Mary to attend her wedding. Lou held his peace and they parted friends. Even when Lou lived in Los Angeles, he and Edie kept in touch, because their grown daughters remained a common bond between them. In the Lou Grant series, Edie was revealed to be Roman Catholic and of Ukrainian heritage. *Gordon Howard, better known as Gordy, was played by actor John Amos. Gordy was the weather reporter on the nightly WJM-TV newscast. Affable, intelligent and professional, Gordy was the polar opposite of Ted. In 1973, Gordy left WJM, and eventually got a job as host of a talk show in New York City. Ted thought this would be a great chance for him to become a national name, and wheedled Gordy to allow him to join him; but Gordy, although his friend, was also wise to his ways, and gently told him no. After that, Gordy returned to New York and reaped success. :The producers introduced Gordy as a weatherman because at the time they felt very few weathermen at the time were black. The original intention had been to make him a sportscaster, but they felt a weatherman would be funny. In several early episodes the character of Gordy remarks, \\"Why does everyone think I'm the sportscaster?\\" Amos left the show to do Good Times, but after being fired from Good Times in 1976 he returned for one last guest spot as Gordy in 1977. *Bess Lindstrom was portrayed on both The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Phyllis by actress Lisa Gerritsen. Bess is the daughter and only child of Phyllis Lindstrom and her late husband, Lars. Bess helped her mother decorate the new apartment that Mary Richards moved into. She bonded well with Rhoda Morgenstern, to her mother's horror, calling her \\"Aunt Rhoda\\" (to which her mother invariably replied, \\"She's not your aunt\\"). She also bonded with Mary, who was an old friend of her mother's. She only referred to Phyllis by her first name rather than with a motherly endearment. :Bess was more prominently featured on the spin-off show, Phyllis. By this time, Bess was in high school. She and her mother moved to her mother's hometown, San Francisco, after her father died. While Bess's step great-grandmother \\"Mother Dexter\\" despised Phyllis, she got along beautifully with Bess. Near the end of the series, Bess married Mark Valenti (Craig Wasson), the nephew of Phyllis' boss, City Supervisor, Carmen Valenti, and were expecting a baby. *Florence Meredith, best known as Aunt Flo (actually a distant older cousin of Mary Richards), was played on a recurring basis by actress Eileen Heckart. She was a straight-shooting newspaper columnist, who has won over sixteen journalism awards. She made infrequent visits to Minneapolis and also battled Mary's boss, Lou Grant. Although, they clashed, there was a spark between them and they had a brief fling. Flo later made an appearance on Lou Grant, covering the same political campaign as Tribune reporter Billie Newman. *Martin and Ida Morgenstern were portrayed on both The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rhoda by veteran actors Harold Gould and Nancy Walker, respectively. They were the parents of Rhoda Morgenstern. Ida was portrayed as a stereotypical overbearing Jewish mother, whereas Martin was somewhat calmer and more even-keeled. While Rhoda was living in Minneapolis, Ida occasionally visited. When Rhoda moved back to New York, she initially stayed with her mother in the Bronx. During the run of Rhoda, Martin and Ida separated while Martin went off to find himself and pursue a long-shelved dream of becoming a lounge singer. Toward the end of Rhoda's run, Martin had returned and was attempting to win Ida back, though this remained unresolved when the series ended. *Dottie and Walter Richards are Mary's parents. Dottie was played by veteran actress Nanette Fabray and Walter was played by Bill Quinn. Their first appearance was in 1972, two years after Mary had left her fianc√© and moved to Minneapolis. Her parents moved to Minneapolis to be near Mary, though Mary and her mother, in particular, had a bit of trouble learning to relate to one-another, now that Mary was an adult. That season they made a handful of appearances on the series, before disappearing without explanation. *Marie Slaughter was played by actress Joyce Bulifant. Marie was the wife of news writer, Murray Slaughter, and a homemaker. She and Murray had three daughters; they adopted a Vietnamese son toward the end of the series. *Joe Warner was played by actor Ted Bessell. He became Mary's boyfriend during season 6, appearing in two episodes. Prior to appearing on the Mary Tyler Moore show, he was best known for having played Marlo Thomas' boyfriend in the sitcom That Girl. *Bill, Mary's ex-boyfriend. A doctor, whom Mary dated throughout his med school and residency, after which, he broke things off with her. He appeared only in the pilot, in which he attempted to try to reestablish their relationship, and was played by Angus Duncan. *Howard and Paul Arnell, brothers both of whom were played by actor Richard Schaal. Howard appeared in several Season One episodes as an old boyfriend of Mary's. She broke up with him because of his obsession with her, and his overbearing nature. He appeared at Mary's high school reunion, and also attended an impromptu cocktail party Mary and Rhoda hosted. Mary also briefly dated Howard's much more low-key brother Paul, whose company she enjoyed a bit more, but his parents (Mary Jackson and Henry Jones) seemed to favor Howard, and felt that Mary was being disloyal to him by dating Paul. *Andy Rivers was played by actor John Gabriel. Andy was WJM's sports reporter, and was hired by Mary. He appeared in five episodes in Seasons 4 and 5. He occasionally dated Mary. *Dan Whitfield was played by actor Michael Tolan. Dan taught an evening journalism class that Mary and Rhoda enrolled in. He occasionally dated Mary. *Charlene McGuire, a lounge singer who occasionally dated Lou Grant. Charlene was played by Sheree North, and in one episode by Janis Paige. *Armond Lynton, played by Jack De Mave. Armond (along with his wife Nancy) was Rhoda's \\"date\\" for an evening get-together with Mary in the second episode of the series. He returned in the second season, recently divorced from Nancy, responding to a chain letter sent by Mary. *Pete was played by actor and cameraman J. Benjamin Chulay A.C.E. (actor). Pete was the blond-haired fellow in the background on certain episodes. He had small speaking appearances in two episodes in 1973 - 1974. *Rayette was played by Beverly Sanders. She is a waitress in a restaurant where Mary occasionally has lunch.

It has been engineered for an increase of safety in the occurrence of an automobile accident. As a result, this form of seat belt has been mandated in the race car competition of NASCAR. This was an invention made mandatory to have due to the high velocities involved in the sport. Along with the design of the seat belt, helmet straps have been designed to increase the safety of the driver. This invention has also been used to secure infants and young children in child safety seats. Structure The five-point harness is preferred as a safety mechanism for its high amount of safety compared to other designs. The five-point harness consists of five straps. Two are located at the shoulders, two at the hips, and one at the crotch that all come to connect to a buckle release mechanism. This way of buckling up holds the driver's body tight in the seat, which in turn protects the upper body from injury. The only downside to this seat belt mechanism is the insecurity of the driver's head. Helmet There have been different models of helmets designed to hold the drivers head in place. A helmet restraint is equipped in some five-point harness seats to prevent brain and neck injury. For example, in NASCAR, it protects the driver in case of a car crash or an immediate change of velocity where the driver has limited control of his momentum. The apparatus consists of a strap that runs from both of the sides of the helmet to the vehicle; or a strap connected to the vehicle from both sides of the driver that runs across the front of the helmet, instead of two independent straps on each side attached to the helmet. Helmet Straps To prevent the helmet straps from impairing the drivers vision, there is a design where the straps are held horizontal to prevent the straps from sagging. There are also designs in which no apparatus is needed to keep straps out of the drivers sight. Helmet straps are made up of shock absorbing material used while climbing or for security when working at high elevations. The straps include a woven nylon that requires up to 475 lbs. of force to cause the straps to tear. Straps that are stretchable allow the drivers brain to slow down to avoid brain damage caused from the brain slamming into the skull; but the straps do not let the head move too far forward to cause neck injuries. Child seats The five-point harness is also used to buckle up children in forward-facing and rear-facing seats. It is designed with the same concept of tightly holding the passenger to the seat with the use of five different straps but built for the young children. This form of seat harness for young children \\"should be a default standard\\" when children are present in a motor vehicle according to Phil Wilson. The reason there have been a number of injured young children and infants in survivable accidents is due to incorrect use of the Child Safety Seat (CSS). To assist caregivers in the safe transportation of children, the USA National Child Passenger Safety Board maintains the quality and integrity of the National Child Passenger Safety Certification Training Program.National Child Passenger Safety Board The program is used to train and certify child passenger safety technicians and instructors. Three of the most common issues that put children at risk: improperly used or installed safety seats, children left in hot cars, and teen drivers.National Safety Council Citations References 1\\\\.

They are located in the west of the Park, around 48 km from Mtito Andei. The source of the springs is a natural reservoir under the Chyulu Hills to the north. The Chyulu range is composed of volcanic lava rock and ash, which is too porous to allow rivers to flow. Instead, rain water percolates through the rock, and may spend 25 years underground before emerging 50 kilometres away at Mzima. The natural filtration process gives rise to Mzima's famously clear stream, which flows through a series of pools and rapids. Two kilometres downstream from the springs, the stream is blocked by a solidified lava flow and disappears below the surface again. Mzima is one of Tsavo's most popular wildlife attractions owing to its resident populations of hippos and Nile crocodiles. Mzima's isolation makes both species are dependent on its waters: other sources are too distant for them to reach by overland travel. The hippos also sustain an entire food chain. They browse the surrounding savannah by night and return to Mzima's pools by day, where their dung fertilises the water. Fruiting trees such as date and raffia palms, waterberrys and figs grow beside the water, using their submerged roots to absorb nutrients. Their fruits are a source of food for vervet monkeys and a variety of birds. Below the water's surface, the invertebrates which feed on the hippo dung are preyed on by fish and cormorants. The springs were made famous by wildlife film-makers Alan and Joan Root's 1969 nature documentary Mzima: Portrait of a Spring, which featured underwater footage of the hippos and crocodiles. They were also the subject of the Survival Special Mzima: Haunt of the Riverhorse in 2003, which featured the first footage of a hippo infanticide. In 2009, a prolonged drought proved catastrophic for Mzima's wildlife. Starving game animals were driven to permanent water sources in their thousands, bringing them into competition with the resident hippos. The grassland surrounding the spring turned to desert and hippos began starving to death. In September 2009, only five remained, down from 70 in 2003, and journalists reported seeing carcasses floating in the pools. Source of Coast Water Mzima Springs, Marere, and Tiwi in Kwale County are the other sources of water (after Baaricho which supply 90 million litres per day). They supply 20 million litres a day to Voi, Mariakani, and the South Coast.

The project was developed by The Planetary Society, a global non-profit organization devoted to space exploration. It consists of two spacecraft‚ÄîLightSail 1 and LightSail 2\\\\. LightSail 1 was an engineering demonstration mission designed to test its new sail deployment method in space, it did not perform solar sailing. LightSail 2 is a fully functional spacecraft intended to demonstrate true solar sailing and incorporates the lessons learned from LightSail 1\\\\. LightSail is a follow-on project to Cosmos 1‚Äîa solar-sail spacecraft designed by The Planetary Society in the early 2000s, which was destroyed during a launch failure in 2005. Both LightSail spacecraft measure in their stowed configuration. After sail deployment, the total area of each spacecraft is . History In 2005, The Planetary Society attempted to send a solar sail satellite named Cosmos 1 into space, but the spacecraft's Russian Volna launch vehicle failed to reach orbit. In 2009, the Society began working on a CubeSat-based solar sail based on NASA's NanoSail-D project, which was lost in August 2008 due to the failure of its Falcon 1 launch vehicle. (A second unit, NanoSail-D2, was successfully deployed in early 2011.) In 2011, the LightSail project passed its critical design review, which was conducted by a team including JPL project veterans Bud Schurmeier, Glenn Cunningham, and Viktor Kerzhanovich, as well as Dave Bearden of Aerospace Corporation. On May 20, 2015, LightSail 1 (formerly called LightSail-A) launched. It deployed its solar sail on 7 June 2015 and re-entered the atmosphere, as planned, on 14 June 2015. In March 2016, The Planetary Society announced a new naming convention for the spacecraft: the test flight (originally LightSail-A) was renamed LightSail 1, with the second spacecraft named LightSail 2. LightSail 2 launched as a secondary payload on the Space Test Program (STP-2) on a Falcon Heavy rocket on 25 June 2019. It deployed its solar sail on July 23, and successfully downlinked photographs of the deployed sail on July 24. The Society has stated it has no plans for a LightSail 3. Design Artist's concept of LightSail orbiting the Earth As a solar sail, LightSail's propulsion relies on solar radiation and not the charged particles of the solar wind. Solar photons exert radiation pressure on the sail, which produces an acceleration on the spacecraft relative to the ratio of the sail's area to its mass. As such, the design challenge was to maximize the surface area of the sail while minimizing the mass of the spacecraft‚Äîall while adhering to the standard 3-unit CubeSat size limitation. LightSail's modular design is based on a modular 3-unit CubeSat, a small satellite format created for university-level space projects. One CubeSat- sized module carries the cameras, sensors and control systems, and the other two units contain and deploy the solar sails. The spacecraft contains four triangular sails, which combine to form a rectangular-shaped surface. The sails are made of Mylar, a reflective polyester film. LightSail has multiple configurations. It was launched in a stowed configuration with its sails folded within the spacecraft. After launch, it enters an intermediate phase by deploying a small antenna and flipping open its solar panels. This exposes the cameras and reveals the stowed solar sails. To achieve its final \\"solar sailing\\" configuration, LightSail extends four 4-meter cobalt alloy booms that slowly spread open the mylar sail material. Using an internal reaction wheel, LightSail 2 is able to orient itself against the Sun using Earth's magnetic field as a guide. By \\"tacking\\" in and out of the Sun, it can control the force on its sail and thus change its orbit. Costs and funding The entire LightSail project cost US$7 million over 10 years and was paid for by approximately 40,000 individual donors, including $1.24 million raised from a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015. Launch costs were supported by NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites program (LightSail 1) and the Air Force Research Laboratory's University Nanosat Program (LightSail 2). LightSail 1 LightSail 1 with deployed solar sails, 8 June 2015 A preliminary technology demonstrator spacecraft, LightSail 1 (formerly LightSail-A), was launched as a secondary payload aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket at 15:05 UTC on 20 May 2015 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The mission delivered the satellite to an orbit where atmospheric drag was greater than the force exerted by solar radiation pressure. Two days after the launch, however, the spacecraft suffered a software malfunction, which made it unable to deploy the solar sail or to communicate. On 31 May 2015, The Planetary Society reported having regained contact with LightSail 1. After the solar panels were deployed on 3 June 2015, communications with the spacecraft were lost once more on 4 June. In this case, a fault with the battery system was suspected. Contact was then reestablished on 6 June, and the sail deployment was initiated on 7 June.Deployment! LightSail Boom Motor Whirrs to Life. 7 June 2015.

LightSail 2 LightSail 2 with deployed solar sail, 23 July 2019 LightSail 2 was launched on 25 June 2019 and deployed by the Prox-1 carrier satellite into a much higher low Earth orbit than LightSail 1, at over orbital altitude. It was to demonstrate controlled solar sailing in low Earth orbit. By controlling the orientation of the sail relative to the Sun, the flight team hoped to raise the orbit apogee and increase orbital energy following sail deployment. Prox-1 and LightSail 2 were secondary payloads aboard the second operational SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch, which carried the STP-2 payload for the U.S. Air Force. Researchers received the first pictures from LightSail 2 on 7 July 2019, and its solar sails were deployed on 23 July 2019.What to Expect when LightSail 2 Launches into Space. Jason Davis, The Planetary Society. 17 June 2019. On 31 July 2019, The Planetary Society stated that they had raised LightSail 2 orbit by a measurable amount, although it has spent a significant amount of its time randomly tumbling. Though initially planned to reenter Earth's atmosphere after approximately one year, an extended mission was approved on 25 June 2020. The Planetary Society estimates that at the current rate of orbital decay (20‚Äì34 meters per day depending on the level of active sail control) LightSail 2 is expected to remain in orbit until the second half of 2021.

The title comes from the words dulces horas de ayer (sweet hours of yesterday) in the soundtrack song Recordar (To Remember) sung by the soprano Imperio Argentina. Plot The past is a riddle to Juan, a well-off bachelor playwright aged around 40. He is obsessed by it, by memories of the older father who went off to Argentina with another woman and the lovely young mother who then committed suicide. He has written a play called Sweet Hours, which contains what he recalls as key scenes of his early life. The play is in rehearsal and he attends the sessions, watchful and absorbed. He is searching for something. Juan slips in and out of the acted reconstructions and his own not necessarily reliable memories of childhood during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. Prodded by his sister Marta, who neither idolised her mother nor was her pampered darling, Juan begins to see that under her beauty and charm his mother was selfish and manipulative, driving her husband away and by her suffocating affection warping her son for life. Berta, the stunning young actress who is rehearsing the role of the mother and with whom he is falling in love, realises that for her and Juan to be happy together she must replace the dead mother. So the past repeats itself, inescapably it seems.

What it comes down to is that Carlos Saura has a feeling for dark, autumnal elegance, and a dexterous technique that he puts at the service of tired ideas. What saves him from pedantry is that his films have occasional moments of erotic vibrancy. Scenes that aren't explicitly sexual in content are sexualized, so that they become ambiguous and disturbing - even haunting...In a Saura film, something more directly sexual is often impending; it hovers in the atmosphere. ..the wide-eyed Assumpta Serna, when she smiles, has a teasing elusiveness..She makes the atmosphere hum..perhaps Saura means us to see that the cycle is inescapable..The enigma of Saura is his addiction to enigma.\\" Pauline Kael Taking It All In p. 409-411 References External links  New York Times review Category:Spanish films Category:Films directed by Carlos Saura Category:1982 films ","title":"Sweet Hours (Dulces horas)"},{"id":"26140368","text":"Merle Grace Kearns (May 19, 1938 ‚Äì August 9, 2014) was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives representing the 72nd House district and serving as Majority Leader in the 126th General Assembly.

He was known for his photographs of celebrities and often referred to as the \\"king of paparazzi.\\" It is reported that he was the inspiration of the paparazzi character in Federico Fellini's 1960 film La Dolce Vita. Biography Quinto was born in Milan in 1929. He later moved to Rome. Career in Europe Quinto began working as a photographer 1956. After striking up a friendship with director Federico Fellini, he was offered a role in Fellini's upcoming film, La Dolce Vita. Quinto declined the offer for financial reasons, although he did take a role as an extra. He has been reported as being the inspiration for that film's character Paparazzo. In 1960 Quinto took pictures of actress Anita Ekberg and a married movie producer sharing a kiss. Ekberg, who had coincidentally starred as a starlet targeted by paparazzi in La Dolce Vita, is reported to have later shot at him with a bow and arrow in the early morning as he waited outside her house; the shots injured Quinto in his hand. Two years later, Quinto took a picture of Elizabeth Taylor in a \\"compromising\\" position with Richard Burton while she was filming Cleopatra. The proof of Taylor's relationship with Burton while both were still married caused a scandal to erupt, with Taylor being condemned by both the United States House of Representatives and the Vatican. The image has been credited as establishing the reputation of the paparazzi, described by Maureen Callahan of The New York Post as being \\"documentarians of postmodern culture\\". Life in America In 1963 Quinto moved to the United States to work for the Associated Press (AP) after marrying Geraldine Del Giorno. As a photographer for the AP, he covered the funeral of John F. Kennedy and marches in the Civil Rights Movement. He then went on to work at Studio 54. Quinto retired in 1993. On January 16, 2010, Quinto died of pneumonia in Rockville, Maryland. Legacy Quinto has been called the \\"king of the paparazzi\\" and is noted as pioneering several common paparazzi techniques, including hiding in bushes, wearing disguises, and following his targets throughout the city.

Early success in the late 1950s and early 1960s led the franchise to spread to many parts of the Southeastern United States. However, financial woes in the 1970s sent the chain on a decline and most of its restaurants out of business by the 1980s. Today, two Biff Burger restaurants remain. Founding The first Biff Burger restaurant was started by co-owners Bruce and Earl Brane in 1956. It was operated under the National Biff-Burger System, their manufacturing company that oversaw the production of materials to be used within the Biff Burger franchise. Roto-Red Broiler As a burger chain, Biff Burger was known for its ‚Äúflame-broiled‚Äù burger. Biff Burgers were produced using the Roto-red broiler designed by the Branes. The broiler was set up in two parts: An upper rotisserie rack broiled the beef and a second lower rack toasted the buns, which collected the juices dropped from the beef. This method gave the burger its much advertised \\"flame broiled\\" taste. Expansion Early success prompted for the National Biff Burger System to begin expanding Biff Burger. It franchised its restaurants under favorable conditions. Most notably included in its policy are *exclusive area protection *no franchise fee requirement *unique Port-A-Unit drive-in building *free advertising material The restaurants were marketed at roughly $13,000 and more than 800 restaurants were sold. The number of restaurants in Florida grew, with smaller concentrations of restaurants stretching from Georgia to Tennessee to North Carolina. Each of the Biff Burger drive-ins were independently owned as part of the National Biff Burger franchise. Port-A- Units A Port-A-Unit is a uniquely designed transportable building implemented by the National Biff-Burger System. Port-a-units serve as the Biff Burger drive-ins that are preassembled and shipped with hundreds of restaurant tools that included *Roto-red broilers *heavy duty fryers *10' x 30' storage room *built-in refrigerator-freezer *built in restrooms *large road sign This feature of the Biff Burger franchise was designed to maximize profits due its short assembly time (as quick as one week) and easy transportation.Jakle, John. \\"Roadside Restaurants and Place-Product-Packaging.\\" (Accessed February 8, 2010) This is as opposed to typical construction times of buildings that take more than six months. Financial issues Success of the Biff Burger franchise did not last though due to monetary problems in the 1970s. In 1962, the Mary Carter Paint Company bought the National Biff-Burger System. It provided the financial support to the Biff Burger restaurants in the form of supplying food materials and restaurant equipment. However, business ventures in the direction of casinos resulted in finance imbalances and the Mary Carter Paint company relieved its support of the National Biff-Burger system in 1976. Without its main means of attaining supplies, the Biff Burger franchise struggled to sustain itself. Many of the drive-in stands were sold and forced to close down. By the mid-1980s, virtually all existing locations of Biff Burger restaurants went out of business. Today Today, only two Biff Burger restaurants remain, one of which is located in St. Petersburg, Florida, the other is located in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Greensboro location has been named \\"Beef Burger\\" since the 1980s. The culture of Biff Burger remains unchanged since the 1950s. Today, it is a popular gathering spot for bikers and car displays. Friday nights could potentially draw up to 2000 customers to events that involve showcasing hotrods and street rods.\\"Paradise for the Poodle-skirt.\\" St. Petersburg Times.

(2005). International Maritime Boundaries, pp. 2657‚Äì2668. The treaty was signed in Malabo on 23 September 2000 by Equatoguinean president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo and Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo. Demarcation The boundary set out by the text of the treaty does not demarcate the entire Equatorial Guinea ‚Äì Nigeria treaty. When the treaty was signed, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was hearing a case about a maritime dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria; because the result of that case would affect the maritime boundaries in the Gulf of Guinea, it was decided to leave the complete delimitation of the boundary until after the ICJ case concluded. The boundary defined in the treaty runs through the Bight of Bonny and separates the Nigerian mainland from Equatorial Guinea's Bioko Island. The boundary consists of nine straight-line maritime segments defined by ten individual coordinate points. Rather than adopting an equidistant line between the two countries, the treaty takes into account both countries' established economic interests in the Gulf of Guinea, including existing oil wells, oil drilling installations, and existing resource consent licences. The full name of the treaty is Treaty between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea concerning their maritime boundary.

MAP 'four five') is a Rhodesian/Zimbabwean 4x4d heavy troop-carrying vehicle (TCV) first introduced in 1978 based on a Mercedes-Benz truck chassis. It remains in use with the Zimbabwe National Army.  History  The MAP45 Armoured Personnel Carrier ('MAP' stands for mine and ambush protected in Rhodesian military jargon) was developed in 1977-78 by the Rhodesian Army Workshops as a light version of the MAP75 TCV. Production started early in 1978 at Army Workshops but in order to meet the increasing demand, manufacture was contracted out to the Rhodesian private firm Zambesi Coachworks Ltd of Salisbury (now Harare).Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965-80 (1995), p. 58.  General description  The MAP45 consists of an all-welded body with a cut-down troop compartment built on a modified Mercedes-Benz 4.5 ton Series LA911B truck chassis. Adapted from the MAP75 TCV, the open-topped hull or 'capsule' is faceted at the sides, which were designed to deflect small-arms' rounds, and a flat deck reinforced by a v-shaped 'crush box' meant to deflect mine blasts. Three inverted U-shaped low 'Roll bars' were fitted to protect the fighting compartment from being crushed in case the vehicle turned and roll over after a landmine detonation. Due to the shortened top hull, their reduced height presented less of a problem since it did not hamper movements inside the troop compartment as in the MAP75. Protection The hull was made of ballistic 10mm mild steel plate; front windscreen and side windows had 40mm bullet-proof laminated glass.  Armament  Rhodesian MAP45s were usually armed with a FN MAG-58 7.62mm Light Machine Gun (LMG), sometimes installed on a locally produced one-man MG armoured turret to protect the gunner. Vehicles assigned to convoy escorting duties ('E-type') had a Browning M1919A4 7.62mm medium machine gun mounted on an open-topped, cylinder-shaped turret (dubbed 'the dustbin'). For 'externals' twin Browning MG pintle mounts were sometimes fitted, placed behind the driver's compartment. The Zimbabwean vehicles after 1980 sported single pintle-mounted Soviet-made 12.7mm and 14.5mm Heavy Machine Guns (HMG) instead.  Variants  *Troop-Carrying Vehicle (TCV) ‚Äì is the standard IFV/APC version, armed with either a single LMG (Rhodesian SF 1978-79) or HMG (ZNA 1980-present) and capable of carrying 12 infantrymen. *Convoy escorting version ‚Äì designated 'E-type', this is a basic IFV/APC version fitted with the Browning MG 'dustbin' turret. *Command vehicle ‚Äì command version equipped with radios and map boards.  Combat history  The MAP45 TCV soon became a popular vehicle among the elite units of the Rhodesian Security Forces ‚Äì including the Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR), the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI),Grant & Dennis, Rhodesian Light Infantryman 1961‚Äì80 (2015), pp. 24-25. and the Rhodesian SAS ‚Äì who employed it late in the war on their cross-border covert raids ('externals') against ZIPRA and ZANLA guerrilla bases in the neighboring Countries,Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965-80 (1995), p. 58. such as the September 1979 raid on the ZANLA's New Chimoio base in Mozambique (Operation \\"Miracle\\").Touchard, Guerre dans le bush! Les blind√©s de l'Arm√©e rhod√©sienne au combat (1964-1979), pp. 65; 73. After independence, the MAP45 entered service with the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) in early 1980 and participated in the large military exercises conducted at Somabula Plain, Matabeleland that same year. ZNA's 'Four Fives' were thrown into action in November 1980 against ZIPRA troops at the 1st Battle of Entumbane and later at the February 1981 2nd Battle of Entumbane (near Bulawayo, Matabeleland), and later again after February 1982 by helping to put down the Super-ZAPU insurgency in Matabeleland. The converted MAP45 TCVs were also employed by the ZNA forces in Mozambique during the Mozambican Civil War, guarding the Mutare-Beira oil pipeline from 1982 to 1993. The MAP45 later served with the ZNA contingent sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo during the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2002.Abbott & Ruggeri, Modern African Wars (4): The Congo 1960-2002 (2014), pp. 41-42.

It is located in the neighbourhood of Basurto, part of the Basurto-Zorroza district of Bilbao. The station connects the rapid transit network of Metro Bilbao with the commuter rail services of Cercan√≠as Bilbao as well as Bilbao's Tram. The station is a very important interchange hub due to connecting four of the major suburban lines that traverse the Bilbao metropolitan area and Termibus, the city's main bus station. The station is also located in close proximity to San Mam√©s Stadium, home of the Athletic Club Bilbao.  History  The station, originally named simply San Mam√©s, opened as part of Metro Bilbao's line 1 on 11 November 1995. The station was constructed below Sabino Arana Av., the main access to the city from the A-8 motorway, and between the Termibus bus station and the San Mam√©s Stadium. Thus the station had a very high traffic of passengers commuting daily from other parts of the metropolitan area to the bus station, and to the stadium on match days. In 2000, the San Mam√©s station of the commuter rail network Cercan√≠as Bilbao (operated by Cercan√≠as) was opened on a nearby location, as part of the new underground section of lines C-1 and C-2. Despite both stations being in close proximity, they were not physically connected. In addition to that, a third San Mam√©s station was opened in 2002 as part of Bilbao's Tram; unlike the other two the station was located overground and closer to the bus station. The interchange station was built in 2004 allowing for an easy connection between Metro Bilbao and Cercan√≠as Bilbao, which now have a common access and hall, which also connects them directly to the Termibus entrance and the tram stop, which was relocated closer to the new station. In 2017 work began for the construction of a new underground bus station, which involved temporarily shutting down the direct connection between the interchange station and the bus terminal. The connection is expected to be reopened once the new bus station opens at some point in 2019.  Station layout  Santimami/San Mam√©s is in truth two separate underground stations connected by a common hall. The metro station follows the typical cavern-shaped layout of most underground Metro Bilbao stations designed by Norman Foster, with the main hall located directly above the rail tracks, whereas the Cercan√≠as Bilbao station follows a rectangular design with high ceilings.

Cercan√≠as offers rapid-transit services between central Bilbao and other municipalities across the its metropolitan area, with services similar to that of a metro network but with fewer stops.  Metro Bilbao  Metro station. The station is served by Line 1 to Etxebarri, Ibarbengoa and Plentzia and Line 2 to Basauri and Santurtzi. There are trains to San Inazio every two minutes, as both lines run in the same direction, trains from line 2 to Santurtzi and Ibarbengoa every five minutes and to Plentzia every twenty minutes.Official Schedules at Metro Bilbao website There are extended services on weekends. Passengers looking to interchange from line 1 to line 2 or vice versa may do it in this station.  Tram  San Mam√©s is one of the tram stops part of the single line Bilbao's Tram, which connects the districts of Basurto-Zorroza and Ibaiondo. It is operated by Euskotren Tranbia and it opened in December, 2002.  Bus  The close proximity to the current Termibus bus terminal, and the expected future direct connection with the new underground bus station, allows for intermodality with bus services from Bilbobus, Bizkaibus and other regional and long-distance bus services.

Pretty intense. The rock guy (drummer Martin) sounds a lot more original than the jazz guys (keyboard player Berger and--especially-- saxophonist Surman), but only the justifiably ubiquitous Holland (on bass) can keep up with McLaughlin.

The interest began with the first flights of the Montgolfier brothers in 1783 (in a balloon inflated with hot air). Soon afterwards Jacques Alexandre C√©sar Charles flew another type of balloon (inflated with hydrogen) and both types of balloon were in use from then on. The fad quickly spread in France and across the channel in England. Origins The science of lighter-than-air gasses, and specifically the properties of oxygen, had been discovered as early as 1774 by Joseph Priestley, who noted its lightness and explosive qualities when heated. The chemistry of lighter-than-air and heated gasses was eventually put to the test by the Montgolfier brothers, two paper manufacturers in France, while experimenting with heated air caught in paper bags. Balloonomania saw its true origins, however, in the very first public balloon flight on June 4, 1783, with the launching of a large unmanned paper balloon (inflated with hot air) in the countryside near Annonay. The balloon, which had been constructed by the Mongolfier brothers, was thirty feet tall, made of paper and appears to have been intended as an advertising gimmick for the Montgolfier's paper manufacturing company. It was effective, as it drew an enormous crowd of onlookers. Later balloonists such as Jean-Pierre Blanchard and Vincent Lunardi exploited this wonder at the novelty of balloons to draw large crowds and gain personal fame, Lunardi going so far as to proclaim himself an ‚Äúidol of the whole nation [of England]‚Äù in a letter to his guardian. Effect on society Public responses Early ballooning was met with mixed responses. Crowds of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic onlookers would turn out for a balloon launch, even threatening to riot if the launch was delayed. Some, however, were not quite as impressed, as shown by the events of August 27, 1783 when professor Jacques Alexandre C√©sar Charles, who had been commissioned to build a rival balloon to the Mongolfier's version using hydrogen, launched his balloon from the Champs de Mars before a large crowd including American scientist Benjamin Franklin. The balloon travelled for ‚Äúforty-five minutes and fifteen miles to the village of Genoesse, where it was attacked by frightened peasants on landing.‚Äù Regardless of these negative reactions, which were not in the majority, ballooning quickly caught the imagination of the general populace, with a crowd of up to 400,000 clamoring to see Jacques Charles make a manned ascent in Paris on December 1, 1783. Both Blanchard and Lunardi became famous for their ballooning stunts, with Blanchard and his companion Dr. John Jeffries being the first to cross the English channel in a balloon on January 7, 1785. Academic and scientific responses The public reaction among intellectuals and academics was generally cooler, with some critics of balloonomania including the likes of Sir Joseph Banks and Samuel Johnson, who wrote in a 1783 letter to Hester Thrale, who had inquired about the nature of balloons, ‚ÄúHappy are you, Madam, that have ease and leisure to want intelligence of air balloons. Their existence is, I believe, indubitable, but I know not that they can possibly be of any use.‚Äù Sir Joseph Banks, a prominent natural scientist wrote that he was skeptical of the utility of balloons, though he recognized the revolutionary science behind it: ‚ÄúI see an inclination in the more respectable part of the Royal Society to guard against the Ballomania until some experiment like to prove beneficial either to society or to science is proposed.‚Äù However, both men and other scientists and academics would express some personal interest in ballooning, and suggest possible practical purposes, with Banks originally suggesting that perhaps balloons could be used as a way of counterbalancing the weight of a cart or coach, making them easier to move over the ground. Even Johnson recognized the potential for exploration, stating, \\"How easily shall we trace the Nile through all its passages; pass over to distant regions and examine the face of nature, from one extremity of the Earth to the other.\\" Blanchard's companion Dr. John Jeffries considered ballooning to be a major part of an exploration of the secrets of flight, the nature of the upper atmosphere, and the formation of weather, and took instruments such as a mercury barometer, a thermometer, a hydrometer and an electrometer to take different measurements of the upper atmosphere. There were other positive scientific responses, as well. Upon receiving a letter from a friend chronicling a balloon flight, the astronomer William Herschel began to think of balloons as possibly useful for observation, as they might carry telescopes into the upper air, where it was clearer. This idea would eventually evolve into sending telescopes into orbit, which became reality in 1990 with the launching of the Hubble Space Telescope. Collectibles and cartoons At its peak, balloonomania triggered a revolution in souvenirs and collectibles, with balloons being featured on ‚Äúplates, cups, clocks, ivory draughts pieces, snuffboxes, bracelets, tobacco pipes, hairclips, tiepins, even a porcelain bidet with a balloon design painted on the interior.\\" These collectibles proved to be enormously popular among the French populace, starting in the winter of 1783. With the rise of public interest in ballooning, they soon became the subjects of mockery. \\"Many sexually suggestive cartoons soon appeared: the inevitable balloon-breasted girls lifted off their feet, monstrous aeronauts inflated by gas enemas, or ‚Äòinflammable‚Äô women carrying men off into the clouds.‚Äù Literature Balloonomania, merely as a novelty, served as the inspiration for various poets, such as Edward Nares, author of the Ballooniad, a street ballad about ballooning, which mentioned the notion of flying to the moon. Balloonomania would exert a pull on the imaginations of some of the Romantic poets as well. Ballooning appealed to Romantic writer's ideas of the sublime, such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote of balloons as being ‚Äúan image of human longing and inspiration, both uplifting and terrifying‚Äù and William Wordsworth, who opened the poem ‚ÄúPeter Bell‚Äù with the image of a balloon boat: Their point was not lost on the balloonists themselves, as Dr. Alexandre Charles found himself making the first solo voyage in a balloon (inflated with hydrogen) on December 1, 1783, an unplanned accident after Dr. Charles' companion stepped out of the balloon, which then relaunched itself with only Charles inside. He wrote, \\"Never has a man felt so solitary, so sublime-and so utterly terrified.\\" Dr. Charles never went up in a balloon again. Percy Shelley also wrote of balloons, saying, ‚ÄúIt would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned, It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa?‚ÄîWhy do we not dispatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon‚Ä¶ as it glided over that unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.‚Äù Shelley also wrote a sonnet entitled ‚ÄúTo a balloon, laden with Knowledge‚Äù which reads: Balloonomania was not universal amongst the Romantic poets, however. In contrast to Coleridge, Wordsworth and Shelley, William Blake mocked and satirized the idea of manned flight in his unfinished prose work ‚ÄúAn Island in the Moon‚Äù Even after the end of the Romantic period, Balloonomania continued to have an effect on later literary work, including on the early science fiction writer Jules Verne who wrote the book Five Weeks in a Balloon in 1863, about the ballooning adventures of two explorers and their manservant in Africa. Military The military applications of balloons were recognized early, with Joseph Montgolfier jokingly suggesting in 1782 that the French could fly an entire army suspended underneath hundreds of paper bags into Gibraltar to seize it from the British. Military leaders and political leaders soon began to see a more practical potential for balloons to be used in warfare; specifically in the role of reconnaissance. The first recorded use of a balloon in warfare was the deployment of a balloon called L'Entrepremant by the French at the battle of Fleurus in 1794, which resulted in a French victory over a coalition of British and Austrian forces. After that victory, Napoleon started an air balloon corps based in Meudon, and there were fears in England of an aerial invasion, though this never came to pass. Napoleon took his balloon corps to Egypt in 1798, but their equipment was destroyed by Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Aboukir, and Napoleon disbanded his balloon corps in 1799. Balloons would later be used in the American Civil War for reconnaissance and directing artillery barrages on foes that were out of view of the artillerymen on the ground.

The film is also known as Seed of Terror (American reissue title). Plot Several years after his death by electrocution in the late 1930s, ghoulish rapist/murderer Caleb Croft (Michael Pataki) rises from his crypt and brutally assaults young Leslie Hollander (Kitty Vallacher). Leslie becomes pregnant by Croft and delivers a baby boy, whom she nurses with bottles of blood. The child matures into the ruggedly handsome James Eastman (William Smith), who sets out on a mission to find and kill his diabolical father. Eastman enrolls in a college night course that his father is teaching as Professor Lockwood.

When a force applies a tension to one end of a belt or rope wrapped around a curved surface, the frictional force between the two surfaces increases with the amount of wrap about the curved surface, and only part of that force (or resultant belt tension) is transmitted to the other end of the belt or rope. Belt friction can be modeled by the Belt friction equation. In practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a system determine how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around a curved surface to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a working knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing tasks with ropes, pulleys, bollards and capstans.  Equation  The equation used to model belt friction is, assuming the belt has no mass and its material is a fixed composition: : T_2=T_1e^{\\\\mu_s\\\\beta} \\\\, where T_2 is the tension of the pulling side, T_1 is the tension of the resisting side, \\\\mu_s is the static friction coefficient, which has no units, and \\\\beta is the angle, in radians, formed by the first and last spots the belt touches the pulley, with the vertex at the center of the pulley. The tension on the pulling side of the belt and pulley has the ability to increase exponentially if the magnitude of the belt angle increases (e.g. it is wrapped around the pulley segment numerous times).  Generalization for a rope lying on an arbitrary orthotropic surface  If a rope is laying in equilibrium under tangential forces on a rough orthotropic surface then three following conditions (all of them) are satisfied: 1\\\\. No separation ‚Äì normal reaction N is positive for all points of the rope curve: N=-k_nT>0, where k_n is a normal curvature of the rope curve. 2\\\\. Dragging coefficient of friction \\\\mu_g and angle \\\\alpha are satisfying the following criteria for all points of the curve -\\\\mu_g<\\\\tan \\\\alpha <+\\\\mu_g 3\\\\. Limit values of the tangential forces: The forces at both ends of the rope T and T_0 are satisfying the following inequality T_0 e^{-\\\\int_s \\\\omega ds}\\\\le T \\\\le T_0 e^{\\\\int_s \\\\omega ds} with \\\\omega = \\\\mu_\\\\tau \\\\sqrt{ k_n^2 - \\\\frac{k_g^2}{\\\\mu_g^2}}=\\\\mu_\\\\tau k \\\\sqrt{ \\\\cos^2 \\\\alpha - \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha}{\\\\mu_g^2}}, ÔøΩwhere k_gis a geodesic curvature of the rope curve, k is a curvature of a rope curve, \\\\mu_\\\\tauis a coefficient of friction in the tangential direction. If \\\\omega = const then T_0 e^{-\\\\mu_\\\\tau k s \\\\, \\\\sqrt{ \\\\cos^2 \\\\alpha - \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha}{\\\\mu_g^2}}}\\\\le T \\\\le T_0 e^{\\\\mu_\\\\tau k s \\\\, \\\\sqrt{ \\\\cos^2 \\\\alpha - \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2 \\\\alpha}{\\\\mu_g^2}}}. This generalization has been obtained by Konyukhov A.,  Friction coefficient  There are certain factors that help determine the value of the friction coefficient. These determining factors are: * Belting material used ‚Äì The age of the material also plays a part, where worn out and older material may become more rough or smoother, changing the sliding friction. * Construction of the drive-pulley system ‚Äì This involves strength and stability of the material used, like the pulley, and how greatly it will oppose the motion of the belt or rope. * Conditions under which the belt and pulleys are operating ‚Äì The friction between the belt and pulley may decrease substantially if the belt happens to be muddy or wet, as it may act as a lubricant between the surfaces. This also applies to extremely dry or warm conditions which will evaporate any water naturally found in the belt, nominally making friction greater. * Overall design of the setup ‚Äì The setup involves the initial conditions of the construction, such as the angle which the belt is wrapped around and geometry of the belt and pulley system.  Applications  An understanding of belt friction is essential for sailing crews and mountain climbers. Their professions require being able to understand the amount of weight a rope with a certain tension capacity can hold versus the amount of wraps around a pulley. Too many revolutions around a pulley make it inefficient to retract or release rope, and too few may cause the rope to slip. Misjudging the ability of a rope and capstan system to maintain the proper frictional forces may lead to failure and injury.

Historically in Lancashire, it was built in 1889. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1962‚Äì63 to produce carpet fibre, which it continued to do until its closure on 17 October 1980.  History  Pemberton's history was built on coal and cotton. The first May Mill was built in 1889 on the site of Wilde's Mill, a woollen mill built in 1850 and destroyed by fire on 13 June 1859. A second mill, known as Roper's Mill was built and also burnt down after a fire started in the engine house. In January 1889 the May Mill Spinning Company limited was formed to build a new fireproof mill to replace the one destroyed. The cornerstone was laid on 25 March 1889 and the engines, named Louisa and Helen, were dedicated in May 1890. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. May Mill, Pemberton was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950.  Architecture   Power  May No 1 was driven by 800 hp cross compound engine by B Goodfellow, 1892. It had a 20-foot flywheel, 24 ropes operating at 62 rpm. The boilers were 30-foot by 8-foot high-pressure Lancashire boilers. The mill was lit by electricity generated by a Parson's dynamo. May No 2 was driven by a 1500 hp cross compound engine by Ashton Frost, 1901. This had a 28-foot flywheel, 34 ropes operating at 62 rpm.  Equipment  In 1946 May Mill had 77,964 ring spindles, but by 1948 this had fallen to 72,984. It was re-equipped around 1950. Between 1960 and 1962 the mill was converted to electric ring spinning frames. The mill was eventually taken over by Courtaulds in 1962‚Äì63 to produce carpet fibre, which it continued to do until its closure on 17 October 1980.

Founded in 1972, it covers poverty and race issues. It was founded by John A.

The editor and publisher is Fernando D√≠az, with Susan Smith Richardson having served that role in the past. Impact The Chicago Reporter's investigative reporting has had impact in several areas of Chicago and Illinois infrastructure. The paper's earliest influence was its expose of the Chicago Police Department's discriminatory disorderly conduct arrests in 1982, which prompted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to file suit against them, leading to a U.S District Court Judge to rule their arrests unconstitutional. By 1983, the Chicago Police Department's disorderly arrest policy had to be changed to meet federal law. In 2007, The Chicago Reporter also released a study detailing how the largest mortgage lender in the country, Countrywide, was lending high interest loans in majority to minority lenders leading then attorney general of Illinois Lisa Madigan to subpoena Countrywide, ultimately resulting in an $8.7 billion settlement in 2008.Hearing on ‚ÄúThe Causes and Current State of the Financial Crisis‚Äù, Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. 6 (2010) (Testimony of Lisa Madigan). Retrieved 2018-08-23 The Chicago Reporter also won recognition for reporting on the Chicago Fire Department's under- reporting fire deaths in poor and minority neighborhoods.  Reputation  The Chicago Reporter's style is regarded as \\"dispassionate investigative journalism\\" that has garnered it critical acclaim by several other news publications as well as politicians. U.S Senator for Illinois, Dick Durbin, has said, \\"The Chicago Reporter gives us reflection, not reflex. In a digital world of speed and brevity, their coverage takes the time and invests the analysis in issues ranging from gun control to deficits to immigration. The Chicago Reporter earns its stripes with credibility and relevance\\". Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune stated \\"The Chicago Reporter is 'consistently focused on covering what continues to be Chicago's toughest, yet most important story: race relations.'\\"  Awards  The Chicago Reporter and its staff have won several awards beginning in 1974, including the Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service from the Society of Professional Journalists, dozens of Peter Lisagor Awards, and the Salute to Excellence Award from the National Association of Black Journalists.

The Radcliffe Observatory Quarter (ROQ) is a major University of Oxford development project in Oxford, England, in the estate of the old Radcliffe Infirmary hospital.Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, University of Oxford, UK. The site, covering 10 acres (3.7 hectares) is in central north Oxford. It is bounded by Observatory Street and Green Templeton College to the north, the Woodstock Road to the east, Somerville College to the south, and Walton Street to the west. The project and the new university area is named after the grade I listed Radcliffe Observatory to the north east of the site, now the centrepiece of Green Templeton College, which is intended to form the visual centrepiece of the project. History In 2009, planning permission was granted by Oxford City CouncilPlanning permission granted on Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, University of Oxford, UK, 7 October 2009. for the refurbishment of the grade II* listed Radcliffe Infirmary (the oldest wing of the hospital) and the grade II listed St Luke's Chapel and Outpatients Building, which flank the entrance courtyard. The Chapel is now deconsecrated and serves as a venue for events. Archaeological excavations were undertaken by the Museum of London. The remains of three Bronze Age barrows and ring ditches were found, together with evidence of settlement in Saxon times. New accommodation at Somerville College opened in September 2011. For 2012, the Radcliffe Infirmary is being refurbished for occupation by the Humanities Divisional Office, the Faculty of Philosophy, and the Philosophy and Theology Libraries. In June 2012, New Radcliffe House, by Walton Street on the ROQ development site, was completed by the construction company Longcross. The Jericho Health Centre moved into the ground floor of this new building shortly afterwards. A new Mathematical Institute for the University of Oxford has been built on the site, named after the mathematician Sir Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem. The site will also include a Humanities Building and Library, the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, and the Blavatnik School of Government.Turnberry Consulting. (2009.) University of Oxford Radcliffe Observatory Quarter: Mathematical Institute: Planning Statement, University of Oxford. Construction of the Blavatnik School of Government finished in 2015. It is a 22 meter tall building immediately south of Freud's caf√© on Walton Street, designed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, using a ¬£75 million donation from the billionaire Leonard Blavatnik. The Campaign to Protect Port Meadow that has been formed to protest against the Oxford University Castle Mill graduate housing development south of Port Meadow was opposed to this proposal as well due to its impact on the Oxford skyline. In March 2016, Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences relocated from New Radcliffe House to the refurbished Outpatient's Building, adjacent to the old Radcliffe Infirmary. Following a ¬£14m investment, the Grade II-listed outpatients building has been transformed into a new research and teaching centre for primary care researchers. It had been empty since 2007, when the outpatient services were transferred to the West Wing of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Headington. ;Delayed construction of Humanities building After securing planning permission for a new Humanities building in 2010, construction was put on hold due to the 'uncertain financial climate.' In 2015, a spokesman for the University said that the university planned to begin construction of a new Humanities building on the site in 2018. However, the head of the Humanities Division later said that construction would begin in 2021. In June 2019, the university announced that Stephen A. Schwarzman had donated ¬£150 million to establish the Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities.

It was once occupied by the Tunica tribe. Later it was developed by Europeans as the Trudeau Plantation. Tunica treasure In the 1960s, graves at the site were dug up by a local self-described treasure hunter, who worked as a guard at Louisiana State Prison (Angola). He took many artifacts from the area, which had been deposited as grave goods with the more than 100 graves. The Tunica felt that he had stolen tribal heirlooms and desecrated the graves of their ancestors and were outraged at the violations. He tried to sell the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, but the transaction stalled when the museum found that he did not have legal title to the items. In the 1970s, the site was excavated by archaeologists, who uncovered large amounts of pottery, European trade goods, and other artifacts deposited as grave goods by the Tunica from 1731 to 1764 when they were in residence. With help from the State of Louisiana, the tribe filed a lawsuit to obtain the title to the artifacts. A decade passed in the courts, but the ruling became a landmark in Native American history, and it helped lay the groundwork for new Federal legislation, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, passed in 1990. It was also used to prove the ancient heritage of the Tunica peoples, and helped them to gain state and Federal recognition. A museum to house the artifacts was built by the Tunica- Biloxi, in Marksville, Louisiana. They are using it also as a conservation and education center for preservation of their artifacts.

Early years Schulz attended Queen Anne's County High School in Centreville, Maryland. He played football, but his team was \\"terrible\\" and did not win many games.

College career Chowan University Schulz attended Chowan University to play college football, but when he first arrived, he was ninth on the depth chart at defensive end. Because so many players tried out for the team, Schulz did not receive a helmet until other players quit the team. In his first season, Schulz won more games than he had his entire high school career. He was inducted into the Chowan University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1992. East Carolina University Chowan University played against the East Carolina Pirates junior varsity football team, and an assistant coach for the Pirates, Gary Fast, recruited Schulz and about eight or nine other players to East Carolina to play for head coach Ed Emory. Schulz was also recruited by other schools such as Wake Forest, Maryland, Virginia Tech and Tulane.

Fast came back the following day and the day after that in hopes of convincing Schulz to sign a letter-of-intent to East Carolina. Fast explained to Schulz that coach Emory told Fast not to come back to East Carolina if he could not get Schulz to sign a letter-of-intent. When Fast could still not convince Schulz, he called Emory, and, during a snowstorm, flew in to Kent Island, Maryland, where Schulz lived. As soon as Schulz saw Emory get off the airplane, he signed the letter-of-intent immediately. In 1981, with Schulz leading the defense, Emory recorded his first winning season as head coach. Schulz led the team in tackles in 1981 with 125 tackles. He also had nine sacks. He earned honorable mention All- America honors by the Associated Press. In 1982, Schulz made 105 tackles and 10 sacks and earned Associated Press All-America honors. After the season, he tried to get a redshirt out of his freshman year at Chowan in order to play for the Pirates in 1983, but could not get it since he played too much his freshman year. Schulz played in the Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic on December 25, 1982. Schulz was inducted into the East Carolina Athletics Hall of Fame in 1999. Professional career The Green Bay Packers told Schulz that they were going to draft him in the 1983 NFL Draft. However, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round (46th overall), one pick before the Packers would pick. He became the highest draft pick ever to come out of East Carolina until Robert Jones was drafted in the first round (24th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. He was also drafted in the 14th round of the 1983 USFL Draft by the Washington Federals, but he chose to sign with the Eagles. He signed a series of one-year contracts with the Eagles on May 24, 1983. He quickly became the starter at left outside linebacker for the team, and in his NFL debut, a game against the Packers, Schulz made two sacks and had more than 10 tackles. A few weeks later, against the Denver Broncos, Schulz injured his knee, his first injury since before college. He subsequently injured it many times during the season. A more serious knee injury caused him to miss the entire 1985 season. He received the Ed Block Courage Award in 1986 after he came back from the injury. Schulz was released on April 27, 1988 and subsequently retired thereafter. After football Schulz runs his family's 2 seafood restaurant's with his parents, the Fisherman's Inn and Crab Deck (fishermansinn.com) which burned down in 1980 and has since been rebuilt. Schulz opened the Salts Pond Marina Resort located in Hampton, Virginia (VA), right off the Chesapeake Bay. Schulz also is a land developer and manages several commercial properties. He is currently the President of the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department. Personal Schulz is married to his wife, Sherri, and they have four sons: Dusty, Kirby, Kolby and Dorsey. They live on their 123-acre waterfront farm in Chester Maryland where they are avid deer and waterfowl hunters.

Versions of processors based on the A2 core range from a 2.3 GHz version with 16 cores consuming 65 W to a less powerful, four core version, consuming 20 W at 1.4 GHz.  Design  The A2 core is a processor core designed for customization and embedded use in system on chip-devices, and was developed following IBM's game console processor designs, the Xbox 360-processor and Cell processor for the PlayStation 3.  A2I  A2I is a 4-way simultaneous multithreaded core which implements the 64-bit Power ISA v.2.06 Book III-E embedded platform specification with support for the embedded hypervisor features. It was designed for implementations with many cores and focusing on high throughput and many simultaneous threads. A2I was written in VHDL. The core has 4√ó32 64-bit general purpose registers (GPR) with full support for both little and big endian byte ordering, 16 KB+16 KB instruction and data cache and is capable of four-way multithreading. It has a fine grain branch prediction unit (BPU) with eight 1024-entry branch history tables. The L1 caches is a 16 KB 8-way set-associative data cache and a 4-way set-associative 16 KB instruction cache. It executes a simple in-order pipeline capable of issuing two instructions per cycle; one to the 6-stage arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and one to the optional auxiliary execution unit (AXU). It includes a memory management unit but no floating point unit (FPU). Such facilities are handled by the AXU, which has support for any number of standardized or customized macros, such as floating point units, vector units, DSPs, media accelerators and other units with instruction sets and registers not part of the Power ISA. The core has a system interface unit used to connect to other on die cores, with a 256-bit interface for data writes and a 128-bit interface for instruction and data reads at full core speed.  A2O  The A2O is a slightly more modern version, using the Power ISA v.2.07 Book III-E. It's optimized for single core performance and designed to reach 3 GHz at 45 nm process technology. The A2O differs from it's sibling in that it's only two way multithreaded, 32+32 kB data and instruction L1 caches, and is capable of out-of-order execution. A2O is written in Verilog. When A2O was released, no actual products have used it.  OpenSource  In the second half of 2020 IBM released the A2I and A2O cores under a Creative Commons license, and published the VHDL code on GitHub. The intention was to add them to the OpenPOWER Foundation's offerings of free and open processor cores. As A2 was designed in 2010, A2I and A2O are not compliant with the Power ISA 3.0 or 3.1 which is mandatory for OpenPOWER cores. It's IBM's wish for the cores to be updated so they comply with the newer version of the ISA.  Products   PowerEN  The PowerEN (Power Edge of Network), or the \\"wire-speed processor\\", is designed as hybrid between regular networking processors, doing switching and routing and a typical server processor, that is manipulating and packaging data. It was revealed on February 8, 2010, at ISSCC 2010. Each chip uses the A2I core and has 8 MB of cache as well a multitude of task-specific engines besides the general-purpose processors, such as XML, cryptography, compression and regular expression accelerators each with MMUs of their own, four 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports and two PCIe lanes. Up to four chips can be linked in a SMP system without any additional support chips. The chips are said to be extremely complex according to Charlie Johnson, chief architect at IBM,IBM gives birth to 'wire-speed' processor and use 1.43 billion transistors on a die size of 428 mm¬≤ fabricated using a 45 nm process.  Blue Gene/Q  The Blue Gene/Q processor is an 18 core chip using the A2I core running at 1.6 GHz with special features for fast thread context switching, quad SIMD floating point unit, 5D torus chip-to-chip network and 2 GB/s external I/O. The cores are linked by a crossbar switch at half core speed to a 32 MB eDRAM L2 cache. The L2 cache is multi-versioned and supports transactional memory and speculative execution. A Blue Gene/Q chip has two DDR3 memory controllers running at 1.33 GHz, supporting up to 16 GB RAM. It uses 16 cores for computing, and one core for operating system services. This 17th core will take care of interrupts, asynchronous I/O, MPI flow control, and RAS functionality. The 18th core is used as a spare in case one of the other cores are permanently damaged (for instance in manufacturing) but is shut down in functional operation. The Blue Gene/Q chip is manufactured on IBM's copper SOI process at 45 nm, will deliver a peak performance of 204.8 GFLOPS at 1.6 GHz and draws about 55 watts. The chip has a die size of 19√ó19 mm (359.5 mm¬≤) and uses 1.47 billion transistors.

Founded in 2008, Wikitude initially focused on providing location-based augmented reality experiences through the Wikitude World Browser App. In 2012, the company restructured its proposition by launching the Wikitude SDK, a development framework utilizing image recognition and tracking, and geolocation technologies. The Wikitude SDK is the company's core product. First launched in October 2008, the SDK includes image recognition & tracking, 3D model rendering, video overlay, location based AR. In 2017 Wikitude launched its SLAM technology (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) which enables object recognition and tracking, as well as markerless instant tracking. The cross platform SDK is available for Android, iOS and Windows operating systems, being optimized as well for several smart eyewear devices. The Wikitude app was the first publicly available application that used a location-based approach to augmented reality.  How it works   Location based augmented reality  Wikitude initially entered the market with its geo location AR app. The Wikitude app was the first publicly available application that used a location-based approach to augmented reality. For location-based augmented reality, the position of objects on the screen of the mobile device is calculated using the user's position (by GPS or Wi-Fi), the direction in which the user is facing (by using the compass) and accelerometer. Augmentations can be placed at specific points of interest and afterwards viewed through the devices' screen or lenses. One of the best known examples of Geo based AR is Pokemon Go.  Image Recognition  Since August 2012, Wikitude also features image recognition technologies that allow for tracker images to trigger augmented reality technology within the app. The software identifies relevant feature points of the target image (also known as marker). This allows to overlay and stick augmentations in specific position on top or around the image.  SLAM: Instant Tracking, Object and Scene Recognition  In 2017 Wikitude launched its SLAM technology. Instant Tracking, the first feature using SLAM, allows developers to easily map environments and display augmented reality content without the need for target images (markers). Object Recognition is the latest addition based on SLAM, with the launch of SDK 7. The idea behind Object Recognition and Tracking is very similar to Image Tracking, but instead of recognizing images and planar surfaces, the Object Tracker can work with three-dimensional structures and objects (tools, toys, machinery‚Ä¶).  Discussion  Opinions differ as to whether the location-based approach of augmented reality implemented by Wikitude can be considered as augmented reality. There is also concern for the accuracy of the GPS, compass and motion sensors used to calculate the position of the virtual objects. Inaccuracies could accumulate to the point that they prevent delivering a feasible result. In practice, this technique proves to be much simpler to implement than ones using the marker-based approach. In a current listing of the Top 5 AR Apps from The Telegraph, three mobile applications use the location-based approach (Google Goggles used both approaches).

Contour drawing, is an artistic technique used in the field of art in which the artist sketches the style of a subject by drawing lines that result in a drawing that is essentially an outline; the French word contour meaning, \\"outline\\".http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=contour The purpose of contour drawing is to emphasize the mass and volume of the subject rather than the detail; the focus is on the outlined shape of the subject and not the minor details. However, because contour can convey a three-dimensional perspective, length and width as well as thickness and depth are important; not all contours exist along the outlines of a subject.Sutherland, Jane. 1997. \\"Gesture drawings.\\" American Artist (VNU eMedia, Inc.) 61, no. 656: 11. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost . Retrieved 9 February 2010. This technique is manifested in different styles and practiced in drawing development and learning. Importance Contour drawing is an essential technique in the field of art because it is a strong foundation for any drawing or painting; it can potentially modify a subjects‚Äô form through variation within the lines. It is widely accepted among schools, art institutions, and colleges as an effective training aid and disciplineNicola√Ødes, Kimon. 1941. \\"The Natural Way to Draw\\". Houghton Mifflin Company Boston for beginner artists. In the hands of a talented master, the line that conveys contour can deliver an astonishing amount of visual delight. Technique In a continuous-line drawing, the artist looks both at the subject and the paper, moving the medium over the paper, and creating a silhouette of the object. Like blind contour drawing, contour drawing is an artful experience that relies more on sensation than perception; it's important to be guided by instinct. To make a blind contour drawing, an artist does not look at the paper or canvas on which they are working on. Another technique similar to contour drawing is outline drawing; a division between form and the space a subject occupies.Sheenan, Steven. 1994. \\"Two types of line drawings.\\" American Artist (VNU eMedia, Inc.) 58, no. 625: 10. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost . Retrieved 9 February 2010. All three types of drawing are considered to be gesture drawings; the practice of drawing a series of bodies in still form. An outline drawing does not include the visual amusement of human sight, while a contour drawing contains form, weight, mass, space, and distance. Styles By altering the character of the mark, an artist can emulate many aspects of the subject that relate form and space to the viewer. For example, a line can be lighter in value (gradation) to suggest greater distance between objects in the drawing. A darker portion of the contour could represent an object with little or no light source; the space is compressed or the object is lower. Continuous lines used inside the outline of a subject can add accent or cast shadow, depending on the value of the line. Practice The purpose of drawing blindly is to force the artist's eye to move along the contour of the subject as their pencil moves along the paper. Initially, this type of drawing may be difficult and slow, but an artist will find that with practice, it is an effective way of defining observation skills such as identifying and underlying the structure of the subject, relating forms, and conveying the sensual experience of the subject. Through thorough practice in this style, they will be skilled at drawing anything quickly and successively.

The theatre was open from December 23, 1949 to February 18, 2003. It now serves as a location for Adib's Rug Gallery. History The Villa first opened on December 23, 1949, after being built by then-owners Joseph L. Lawrence and David K. Edwards‚Äîthe first feature shown was Prince of Foxes.New Theater Set Debut For December 23 The theater had 1300 seats and was built using a stadium seating design that utilized rising seating on a steep incline.Bid asked for S.L. theater to cost $350,000, seat 1300 Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, The Villa was known for being the first Salt Lake City Theater to show new widescreen formats, including CinemaScope, Technirama-70, and Cinerama. In 1958, the theater became famous for showing a 10-month-long run of South Pacific, drawing Patrons from as far as Idaho and Nevada.History of the Villa In 1960, Cinemiracle, a large, curved screen was installed, reducing the number of seats by approximately 300.'Windjammer' filled with thrills, tunes A year later, Cinerama was installed, which used three projectors instead of one. This was used until 1964, when the system was replaced by a new version that used one projector and 70 mm film. There was an expected expansion to the Villa in 1977 by Mann Theatres, though the project was eventually scrapped. In 1981, the Villa was the only theater in Salt Lake City to offer the new Steven Spielberg film \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". Mall Theater Expansion Planned The Villa was acquired by Carmike Cinemas in 1993. Repairs were started in 1995 and in 1996 a large renovation closed the theater shortly while the famous neon sign was restored, repairs were made to the auditorium's seat and carpets, and a Dolby Digital sound system was installed. In 1998 Carmike Cinemas began a building spree across the Salt Lake Valley, erecting five new multiplexes. This sudden expansion lead to the ultimate demise of many first run theaters built before 1998 in the area. The only theaters left following the expansion were the Carmike 12, Holladay Centre 6, and 5 Star Cinemas. Soon, Carmike Cinemas began to fail financially as a result of building too many multiplexes. In the fall of 2000 Carmike Cinemas entered bankruptcy and The Villa was put up for sale, with a 2.4 million dollar asking price. A sale to Eddie Simatov, owner of the Simatov Oriental Rug Gallery, fell through in 2001, and Carmike Cinemas was forced to hold onto the location.Failed sale of 2001 In 2001, USA Today named the Villa Theater on a list of ten great classic theaters in the United States.10 great places to see a classic cinema This decision was criticized by some who said that the theater was run down and undeserving of the acknowledgment. Carmike Cinemas responded by cleaning up and repairing the theater, even taking out an advertisement for the Villa hyping the summer's blockbuster hit Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones. Even as ticket sales increased at the Villa during 2002, the financial improvement was not enough to take the theater off the market. Carmike considered simplifying or replacing the theater's neon sign, which was expensive to maintain and made maintaining a profit extremely difficult.Falling revenue foe the Villa Wal-Mart looked into the possibility of turning the Villa into a Neighborhood Market. Instead, Harmons Grocery, which operates a grocery store near the Villa Theater, bought the property. Harmons offered to let Carmike Cinemas lease the theater, but they declined.Wal-Mart and the Villa The last movie to show at the Villa Theatre was The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers on 18 February 2003. Despite it being a weekday and the film's considerable length, it drew a large crowd for the theater's final showing. Carmike Cinemas repaired the neon on the theater's sign and marquee during the Villa's last week of operation so that it would be in perfect condition for closing night. Post Theater After the theater officially shut its doors, Harmons started a sale of the theater to a buyer who wanted to turn it into Club Villa, a night club with a high-tech dance floor. Harmons seemed more interested in turning the largest profit, focusing on the historic legacy of the theatre. Harmons received many offers to turn the Villa back into a movie theater, though they did not accept any of these. Though the deal to the night club group seemed almost certain, it eventually fell through. In 2004 the Villa became a rug gallery with a sale of the theater to Dr. Hamid Adib, owner of Adib's Rug Gallery. Adib wanted to create a museum-like atmosphere, where people could enjoy the fine craftsmanship and elegant beauty of Persian and Oriental rugs and at the same time relive the history of the Villa.

Clustering can be contrasted with other ability-grouping strategies in which high achievers fill their own dedicated class, entirely separate from other students. Cluster grouping is not experimental as it has been used successfully since 1974.Rogers, Reforming..., p. 226 While no single practice is a panacea for gifted instruction, Schuler's national survey showed a 99% positive approval rating among parents of clustered children and a 90% positive approval rating among the children themselves. Over two-thirds of administrators had a similar positive experience.Schuler Although typically implemented in the upper elementary grades (3-6), cluster grouping has been used in grades K through 12.Schuler The methods for selecting children for cluster groups are usually similar to those for other gifted and talented services.Schuler Several instructional options are typically used within a cluster, including: enrichment and extensions, higher-order thinking skills, pretesting and differentiation, compacting, an accelerated pace, and more complex content.Schuler\\"Through cluster grouping the intellectual, social, and emotional needs of the gifted students can be addressed.\\"Schuler, Patricia A., Cluster Grouping Coast to Coast, Neag Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development, University of Connecticut For clustering to be effective, the teacher must be motivated to work with gifted children and receive specialized training, the curriculum for the cluster must be appropriately differentiated, and the remainder of the class cannot contain difficult or demanding students.Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D. The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) pp. 29-30. Other anecdotal success factors for teachers include: fostering the valuing and acceptance of differences within the classroom, allowing pretesting and credit for previously mastered material, designing independent study that utilizes student passion, remaining flexible in teaching style, and maintaining a sense of humor.Winebrenner, p. 179. Advantages There is strong research evidence supporting the tutorial benefits of clustering gifted students during a single classroom.Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., Re-forming Gifted Education (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 249. consistent with one survey, advantages include: cost effectiveness, high challenge and expectations of scholars , faster progression through curricula, administrative ease in observation of services, increased understanding of GT students, and an improved opportunity to deal with the psychological needs of the GT students.Schuler Also, children with subject-specific giftedness, who might rather be exclude from gifted pull- outs, are often placed within the cluster classroom to require part in advanced work when appropriate.Winebrenner, pp. 177-178. Some research has shown that clustering grouping produces positive academic results for all children within the cluster classroom.Gentry, M. (1996), Cluster grouping: An investigation of student achievement, identification and classroom practices. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Connecticut, Storrs. Concerns and criticism Cluster grouping has experienced some negative reception. Teachers in schools that did not limit the extremes with the cluster classroom have expressed frustration at the required range of instruction.Schuler For this reason, Winebrenner recommends that the cluster classroom teacher not also have the neediest students.Winbrenner, p. 197. Some educators may become resentful if not selected as the cluster teacher. For fairness, the responsibility and opportunity of cluster grouping can be cycled in two-year terms through faculty members who are interested and have been trained in its use.Winebrenner, p. 180. Administrators have at times resented special grouping, expressed frustration regarding scheduling, and have simply been biased against any programming for GT children.Schuler Difficulty can arise in placing gifted students who have recently moved into the school district.Winebrenner, pp. 180-181. Cluster grouping has been accused of denying academic leadership to other classes, but experience has proven otherwise. When gifted students are grouped for instruction, new leadership emerges among the remaining students.Winebrenner, p. 178. Clusters larger than six students have been criticized as unwieldy. In these cases, Winebrenner recommends splitting the group into two separate classrooms.Winebrenner, p. 177. Parents may apply pressure for their children to be placed within the cluster classroom even if their child does not qualify for the cluster group and there is no research evidence of an inspirational effect. To address this problem, schools can ensure that all staff are trained in differentiation and that all non-GT students are cycled into a cluster classroom at an equal rate over the entirety of their school years.Winebrenner and Devlin Comparison to tracking, pull-outs, and mixed-ability groups A comprehensive study of grouping by Rogers states, \\"Students who are academically or intellectually gifted and talented should spend the majority of their school day with others of similar abilities and interests.\\"Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) p. xiii. Magnet schools, schools within a school, and classrooms composed entirely of gifted students may not be appropriate in all districts. In these situations, the study goes on to state, \\"The Cluster Grouping of a small number of students, either intellectually gifted or gifted in a similar academic domain, within an otherwise heterogeneously grouped classroom can be considered when schools cannot support a full-time gifted program (either demographically, economically, or philosophically).\\" Cluster grouping is distinct from tracking in that tracking organizes entire classrooms by ability, and little mobility exists between tracks as students progress through school.Winebrenner, p. 178. Conversely, cluster groups tends to expand over time rather than remain fixed.Gentry, Marcia L. \\"Promoting Student Achievement and Exemplary Classroom Practices Through Cluster Grouping: A Research-Based Alternative to Heterogeneous Elementary Classrooms.\\" Research Monograph 99138. Storrs, CT: NRC/GT, University of Connecticut, 1999. While cluster groups allow GT children to spend the majority of their day with academic peers as recommended by research, pull-outs (also called \\"send-out\\" or \\"resource\\" programs) tend to meet one to two hours per week.Rogers, Reforming..., p. 219. A 1993 U.S. Government report found up to 72% of school districts using the pull-out approach despite this method being generally unsuccessful.\\"Part II. The Current Status of Education for the Nation's Most Talented Students,\\" in National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent (online). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1993) This lack of effectiveness has been echoed in more recently literature.Davidson, Jan and Bob, with Vanderkam, Laura (Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, NY, NY, 2004) Genius Denied: How to Stop Wasting Our Brightest Young Minds, p. 67. Specifically, this is because pull-outs are often a hodgepodge of critical thinking, logic puzzles, and random subjects (e.g., mythology) which are unlikely to result in any significant academic progress because they are not tied directly to the core curriculum.Rogers, Re-forming..., p. 221. However, properly-implemented pull- out programs can be used to complement cluster grouping.Winebrenner, Susan, and Devlin, Barbara, Cluster Grouping Fact Sheet: How to Provide Full-Time Services for Gifted Students on Limited Budgets Finally, mixed-ability grouping does not provide academic benefit to gifted children, and it can result in alienation and isolation of GT students.Rogers, Reforming..., p. 249. In mixed ability group projects, gifted children frequently do most of the work or teach the other children, which is not their responsibility and for which they have no certification.

He later served as Assistant District attorney of Middlesex County and as the Commonwealth's Assistant Attorney General in charge of prosecution of racketeers. In 1952, Fingold defeated incumbent Attorney General Francis E. Kelly. On December 18, 1953 Fingold called for the Massachusetts Governor's Council to ban the comic book Panic within the state, on the grounds it \\"desecrated Christmas\\" depicting the holiday in a \\"pagan\\" manner. Under his orders the head of the state police, Captain Joseph Crescio, cut off distribution of Panic throughout Massachusetts, and by December 21, the book had been pulled from nearly all the newsstands in the Greater Boston area. Fingold warned distributors who resisted compliance that they would be susceptible to criminal prosecution, although it is unclear what they would've been charged with. Publisher William M. Gaines retaliated by announcing that he was permanently withdrawing Panic from distribution in the state of Massachusetts and yanking his Picture Stories From The Bible from that state (which hadn't been published in over five years). \\"The idea was, 'If you don't want us, we don't want you,'\\" explained editor and writer Al Feldstein, who said he had felt a \\"certain literary pride\\" in having his book banned.

In 2009, the owner Landry's, Inc., which acquired the hotel from the Galveston Council in 2003 for $500,000, advised the Galveston city planning commission it would demolish the hotel and build an international amusement park on the pier. Demolition of the hotel took place in February 2011. Work then began on the new Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier which opened in May 2012.

The road, which would be built in a rural area, is projected to connect U.S. Route 550 (US 550) near Rio Rancho to Interstate 40 (I-40) near the Rio Puerco (approximately from central Albuquerque). It is mentioned in a transportation plan geared towards the year 2030 produced by the Mid-Region Council of Governments and would likely be funded by mostly private sources. The projected cost of the first phase of construction is $52,890,000, later stages are projected to amount to approximately $70,000,000. The two-lane highway would initially have a gravel surface; the right-of-way could accommodate the expansion of the road into a freeway if needed due to future growth. The announcement of a federal environmental assessment concerning the corridor reignited old controversies over the planned road. Some proponents of the road argue that it will ease traffic congestion in metropolitan Albuquerque and facilitate the economic development of the region, creating many jobs. Some opponents of the road argue that it would induce sprawl and that the inclusion of public money to develop the road would be an unfair subsidy to the developers who own the land around it. Some planners point out that traffic projections show that there is no need for the right-of-way, which was given to Sandoval and Bernalillo counties in the early nineties by the landowners, while backers claim that the road will nonetheless have to be built to serve the eventual development that is planned for the area.

The final episode aired on April 6, 1995 and the remaining six episodes were never aired in the United States.

NBC chose to commission a special episode of Friends to air immediately following Super Bowl XXX the next year and the experiment was such a success that the other networks have for the most part chosen to air one of their established series after covering the Super Bowl, with particular attention paid to season premieres of popular reality competitions like Survivor and The Voice.

The Woodmere Art Museum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, also hosted an exhibition 'Dal Maestro' in October, 2004, of more than fifty works by Nelson Shanks. In addition, his work is held in distinguished collections worldwide.  Portraiture  Portrait of Diana, Princess of Wales by Nelson Shanks Known for his skill in capturing the complex nature of his subjects, Shanks' portraits have contributed to his reputation as one of the foremost contemporary figurative painters. Among his notable commissions are Diana, Princess of Wales, Pope John Paul II for the Vatican Museum, Margaret Thatcher, U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton for the National Portrait Gallery. Significant commissions also include Luciano Pavarotti for the Metropolitan Opera, Mstislav Rostropovich for the Kennedy Center, Denyce Graves for the National Portrait Gallery and the private collection at Althorp of Charles, Lord Spencer. Other portraits include King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Silvia of Sweden, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, J. Carter Brown, Katharine Graham, Judge Guido Calabresi, Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop, Robert Wood Johnson, Jr., James Burke, Marcus Wallenberg, Dr. Peter Wallenberg, Ms. Darla Moore, Mr. Lionel Pincus, Mr. Jerry Speyer, Chairman of the Board, Museum of Modern Art, Arthur O. Sulzberger, Sr., Chairman of the Board, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Chairman Emeritus New York Times, Mary McFadden, United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and many others. His work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide, including the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden, Kensington Palace in London and Fortezza Firmafede in Sarzana, Italy. In 2015, Shanks said he had hidden a secret reference to the blue dress worn by Monica Lewinsky into the official portrait of President Bill Clinton hanging in the National Portrait Gallery by way of a shadow. Teaching Shanks was a realist, attempting to capture the essence of his subjects through acute observation and technical skill. Whether the subject was still life, landscape or figurative, the work was meant to evoke emotion and challenge the viewer to make close examination. In the words of the artist, \\"The Realistic painting must be nothing less than a meditation on the nature of existence and the individual. It must create likeness with the power to kindle the observer's imagination and awaken memories.... It must encompass all that the Realist painter sees before his eyes and therefore feels in his heart.\\" Shanks' teaching philosophy emphasized the importance of gaining knowledge and training the student to \\"see\\" with the understanding that it takes years of concentration and practice to become a highly skilled painter. Throughout his career, Shanks painted nearly every day of the year‚Äîlandscape, still life, the figure and portraits. He set goals to grow and improve with every painting and encouraged students to do the same. Shanks taught on the faculty of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Art Students League, National Academy of Design, George Washington University and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, among others. He established an apprentice program at his Bucks County home and studio, where artists received room, board and instruction at no cost. In the late 1990s, he launched a successful series of workshops in response to the growing need for serious art instruction. The need for students to immerse themselves deeply in his teaching principles was indicated by the high demand for and over-subscription to these workshops, which led to the decision to open a full-time atelier program in 2002, named Studio Incamminati, which can be translated from the Italian as \\"those who are progressing\\". The name also aims to invoke the spirit and practices of its namesake‚Äîthe studio founded by the Renaissance artist Annibale Carracci. Nelson, and his wife, Leona Shanks, founded Studio Incamminati to provide a place where artists devoted to realism could study painting and acquire other skills necessary for successful artistic careers. Nelson Shanks was committed to changing the world's view of art and through Studio Incamminati attracted people willing to devote time to this cause. Reception  Recognition and awards  In 1996, Shanks was awarded the \\"Sargent Medal\\" for Lifetime Achievement by the American Society of Portrait Artists In 2006, Governor Edward Rendell presented Shanks the Governor‚Äôs Distinguished Arts Award, which recognizes a Pennsylvania artist of international fame or renown whose creations and contributions enrich the Commonwealth. Among those contributions noted were his lifelong commitment to teaching and his establishment of Studio Incamminati. In 2009, Shanks was awarded the Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Portrait Society of America. In 2011, for \\"transcendent work\\" and contributions to culture, the members of the Russian Academy, the centuries-old institution that governs art education and exhibitions in the Russian Federation, voted to make Shanks an honorary member of their ranks. Death Shanks died of prostate cancer at his home in Andalusia, Pennsylvania on August 28, 2015 at the age of 77.

He composed madrigals, sacred motets, and choral settings of the Mass. Felis was born in Bari, in the province of Apulia of the Kingdom of Naples, where he became a canon at Santa Nicola. He later became Maestro di Cappella of the cathedral in Naples. He accompanied the papal nuncio, Antonio Puteo, on a journey to the court of Rudolph II in Prague during the 1580s. It was in Prague that his first book of masses was published in 1588 by the printer Jiri Nigrin, and Felis later remarked upon his stay in Prague in the preface to his Sixth Book of Madrigals, published in Venice in 1591. As an educator, Felis seems to have had a profound effect on the succeeding generation of musicians; Carlo Gesualdo, Giovan Battista Pace, Giovan Donato Vopa, and Pomponio Nenna are counted among his pupils. In Pomponio Nenna's first published collection of madrigals, Il Primo Libro de madrigali √† cinque voci, (c. 1603), there appear several madrigals by Felis. As a teacher, Felis might have allowed the young Nenna to add these works to his pupil's first publication, thereby ensuring its success.

Congregation Ahavath Achim was formed in Stoughton in 1893. Congregation Talmud Torah was formed in Stoughton soon after, in 1895. Both congregations worshiped in various houses. In 1918, the congregations merged with the Hebrew Benevolent Society to form Ahavath Torah Congregation, with 25 members, and Rev. M. L. Graham as its spiritual head. That year the congregation began construction of its first synagogue building on Porter Street, which was dedicated on October 14, 1919. The congregation was, however, only officially incorporated on September 5, 1930. In 1954, Ahavath Achim opened its religious school. In need of a larger synagogue building, it purchased and moved into the former Congregational Church at 30 Pearl Street in 1958. As Stoughton's Jewish population grew, membership increased to 72 families, and land was purchased in three stages for a new synagogue. The present building at 1179 Central Street was dedicated in 1970. Further growth led to a significant renovation and expansion of the synagogue building, which was completed in 1987. The synagogue has hosted many notable guest speakers, including Geert Wilders, Wafa Sultan, and Dr. Mordechai Kedar, as well as entertainment from singer Sam Glaser, and a Bob Lazarus memorial show.

While the international film festival seeks to become an institution in the international film business and trade, fostering multi-national film production, and accessing emerging markets and diverse audiences, Cine Las Americas remains a community oriented Media Arts Center, offering diverse opportunities for culture, education and fun.About Us, History , Cine Las Americas. Retrieved 2011-04-11. The Organization and History sections of this article are sourced from Cine Las Americas with their permission . Festival history The Cine Las Americas International Film festival began in 1997 as a Cuban film retrospective sponsored by the Mexic-Arte Museum in Austin, Texas. While programming the initial event, the organizers realized that although Austin was building its reputation as an important city for producing and showcasing independent film, films made by and about Latinos were largely absent from the community's cultural landscape. In 2001, Cine Las Americas partnered with the Austin Independent School District (AISD) and moved the organization's offices to Johnston High School in East Austin, where it established a Media Arts Center, implementing educational and mentoring programs to support the District's Dropout Prevention Campaign. During this time the organization offered the school's students hands-on bilingual opportunities in multimedia production, event production, and non-profit organization management. Festival-related programs and milestones The training students received in the Cine Las Americas-school district partnership culminated in students producing Emergencia, the youth component of the film festival. In Emergencia they receive entries from around the country, preview them in order to curate a program, grant awards for the best work, and produce a day of free screenings within the context of the festival. Emergencia remains a special competitive section of the festival open to filmmakers ages 19 and under and is curated by students participating in Cine Las Americas' multicultural Media Literacy programs. In 2003, professional musicians and other guest artists began to instruct and mentor dozens of students at a recording studio inside the organization's classroom at the school. There, students were able to write and record music and lyrics in a professional studio environment within a bilingual Digital Music Production curriculum in the after-school program BeatLab. Many students have used skills learned there in preparing work for subsequent Festivals. BeatLab has continued at other area schools since the organization's offices moved to East Austin after its contract with the school expired. Also in 2003, the festival extended its program to include indigenous work from the Americas, established competitive sections granting juried and audience awards. By 2005, the organization had presented more than 300 films at the annual Festival and at various screenings throughout Texas, collaborating with institutions such as The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH), the South By Southwest film festival (SXSW), and the Austin Film Festival.AFF & Cine Las Americas International Film Festival Present...31 MINUTES, Austin Film Festival, 2009.

Career Richert is best known for winning the Cup championship with Dale Earnhardt in 1980. He started out working for Rod Osterlund as a 16-year-old in 1976. Richert had gone to High School in San Jose with Osterlund's daughter who dated one of his friends, who was interested in racing. Doug got interested in building dirt cars because his friends were, and one thing lead to another. In late 1976 he got the chance to move east with Roland Wlodyka who was forming a Cup team, initially living in a trailer on the property at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Osterlund bought the team in late 1977, and campaigned it with Dave Marcis in 1978, followed by Dale Earnhardt who went on to win the NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year in 1979. In May 1980, Crew Chief Jake Elder left the team, and Richert who was still 19, replaced him. Richert may have inherited the job in the beginning, but he earned it fair and square when he went on to win the Championship with Earnhardt. Midway through 1981 Osterlund sold his team to J.D. Stacy, and Earnhardt moved to Richard Childress Racing taking Richert with him. At the end of 1981 Doug left to take a position with Junior Johnson. From 1984 to 1986 Richert was the Crew Chief for Neil Bonnett in the No. 12 Budweiser car.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QZkpAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=sckEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3325%2C1764887 Richert is also the former full-time crew chief for the No. 15 Ford Mustang driven by rookie Timmy Hill and run by Rick Ware Racing in the Nationwide Series. In Cup, he has also been a crew chief for Brian Vickers, Robby Gordon and three seasons with Greg Biffle helping him earn 10 wins. In the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, Richert served as crew chief for three-time champion Ron Hornaday and 2003 Rookie of the Year Carl Edwards. Richert joined BK Racing in 2013, and midway through the season replaced Pat Tryson as crew chief for the team's No. 83 car; at the end of the season he was promoted to the team's director of research and development. Richert left BK Racing before the 2018 season, and became the crew chief for the No. 78 Mason Mitchell Motorsports team in the ARCA Series. However, MMM shut down mid-year, leaving him without a job until he quickly reunited with Max Tullman (one of the drivers he crew chiefed in ARCA that year) after he started his own new Xfinity team, Tullman-Walker Racing. Richert and Tullman went to Carl Long's MBM Motorsports team in 2019, and there he crew chiefed Tullman in the races he ran with them along with some other drivers as well.

He was the son and successor of Artau I. There is a surviving convention between Artau II and his cousin Raymond IV of Pallars Juss√† concerning the castles of Llimiana and Mur, which Raymond commended to Artau. The castellans (seniores) were to be vassals of Artau, with Raymond having the right to fill a vacancy.Adam J.

Artau is known to have given the castle of Cuberes to his vassal Mir Arnau, who in turn gave it to the monastery of Santa Maria de Gerri, to which it had been given on an earlier occasion by Artau's father.Kosto, 213. According to a now-lost charter, Artau and Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona reached an agreement (convenientia) concerning the division of lands after the projected capture of Tortosa (which in any event did not come in their lifetimes).Kosto (2001), 98‚Äì99.

Alva is noted for two major finds: the tomb of the Lord of Sipan and related people in 1987, and 2007. Early life and education Alva was born on 28 June 1951 in Contumaz√° Province. He earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in archaeology. Career Alva has worked for years at the Bruning Archeological Museum in Lambayeque, Peru. He advanced to the post of director there. Major finds Lord of Sipan In 1987, Alva was called by police to investigate a site at Sip√°n, where huaqueros (grave robbers) had stolen artifacts from an archaeological site. Despite being ill with bronchitis, he made the trip. The robbers had discovered a crypt of a lord, filled with jewels and gold, and Alva knew it was significant. Alva did most of the excavating without delay, as he was concerned that robbers might come back and cause more damage. As a result, he started digging without any funding or the support of the area police, with matters made worse as the result of the primary robber being killed by police. After further digging, Alva found, among other things, the undamaged body of a Moche lord. From these finds, he and other scholars were able to determine that Huaca Rajada, a group of three pyramids once thought to belong to the later Chim√∫ culture, were a part of Moche culture. The findings were later described by the National Geographic Society as the richest intact pre-Columbian tomb in the Western Hemisphere. During many of these years, Alva was the director of the Bruning Archaeological Museum in Lambayeque, Peru. Murals at Ventarron In 2007, Alva discovered murals at a 4,000-year-old Peruvian temple in Ventarron. The murals, showing a deer caught in a net, are considered the oldest murals in the Americas. Alva determined their age by the process of carbon dating. The construction material that was used at the temple was not primitive. As a result, Alva was able to show that the civilization was able to spread farther than originally thought. He worked on the dig with his son Ignacio, who is also an archaeologist. Legacy and honors * 1990, the Orden del Sol del Peru was awarded to Alva.

It was her second novel. It was published in three parts, and later collected into a single volume. It was highly criticised during its publication, due to its provocative subject matter and religious and racial themes. Zofloya opens with the adulterous actions of the mother, Laurina di Cornari, and continues to portray the repercussions of her sinful actions throughout the novel. Plot Victoria de Loredani is the beautiful, spoiled daughter of the Marchese di Loredani and his wife, Laurina. Victoria, her brother Leonardo, and her parents reside in a palazzo in Venice, Italy. They live in happiness until the Marchese's friend, Count Ardolph, visits from Germany. Ardolph takes pleasure in destroying the reputations of pure women, and breaking up happy marriages. He quickly sets his sights on Laurina di Loredani. Laurina's vanity makes her susceptible to Ardolph's advances, and he seduces her away from the husband she claims to love. They disappear from Venice together, which sets off a cascade of increasingly tragic events. After Laurina elopes, Leonardo disappears from Venice without explanation, leaving only Victoria and her father in the palazzo. One year later, the Marchese encounters Ardolph in the streets of Venice. They duel, and Ardolph stabs the Marchese‚Äîa wound that puts the Marchese on his deathbed. Laurina pays him a final visit, and the Marchese expresses his dying wish that Laurina will find Leonardo, reclaim her children, and leave Venice. After the Marchese's death, Victoria falls into Ardolph and Laurina's custody, and soon meets Il Conte Berenza, a noble but naive Venetian man. Berenza quickly falls in love with Victoria, but after he overhears her curse her mother, Berenza becomes wary of her evil character. Laurina and Ardolph do not approve of Berenza, so Laurina forges a letter in Victoria's handwriting persuading Berenza to leave Venice. Ardolph and Laurina then send Victoria to live under the tyrannical rule of Laurina's cousin, Signora di Modena. With the help of her servant, Victoria escapes the Signora's household, disguises herself as a peasant, and returns to Venice. She reconciles with Berenza, and they begin living together. Berenza tells her of his former mistress Megalena, who is known for her jealousy. One night, an assassin enters the home of Victoria and Berenza. He attempts to stab Berenza in his sleep, but Victoria awakens and defends her lover by taking the dagger in her arm instead. The man flees, and Berenza awakens deeply shaken by the occurrence. He is impressed by Victoria's action and no longer questions her love for him. Victoria decides not to tell Berenza that she noticed that her long-lost brother, Leonardo, was the assassin. The book then switches to the point of view of Leonardo, recounting what happened to him after his mother abandoned him and he ran away. First, he found shelter with the Zappi family. He fell in love with the family's daughter Amamia, but the mother, Signora Zappi, fell in love with him. Leonardo rejected her advances. Signora Zappi then tried to frame Leonardo, falsely accusing him of rape. Leonardo did not defend himself; instead, he left the Zappi household. Leonardo then took shelter with an old woman, Nina, who was mourning the death of her son. Nina then died, and Leonardo had to move again. Finally, he returned to Venice, where he caught the eye of the fatal Megalena Strozzi. She convinced him to take her as his mistress, told him of the death of his father, and began to control his every move. One day, Megelena came across her former lover Berenza with his new lover (Victoria). In a rage, she told Leonardo that in order to prove his love to her, he must kill Berenza. After some hesitation, he agrees. He comes back after stabbing his own sister instead of Berenza, and tells Megalena what happened. They realize that he left the dagger there, and that Megalena's name is engraved on it. They flee Venice to avoid discovery. The narration now switches back to the perspective of Victoria. Berenza is deeply moved by Victoria's loving action and decides it is time for them to be married. Five years later, Berenza's brother Henriquez comes to visit. Victoria quickly realizes she has feelings for Henriquez, but is saddened to discover that his heart lies with Lilla. Victoria feels that she must do anything to prevent the marriage of Lilla and Henriquez, even at the destruction of lives and hearts, much in the manner of her mother. She begins dreaming about how she will destroy Lilla and be with Henriquez. During her dreams, a familiar face begins to surface: that of Henriquez's servant Zofloya, who she sees as someone who can help her destroy Lilla. During the day, she is intrigued by the handsome figure of the Moor Zofloya, and notices him catching her eye. Zofloya disappears shortly after, apparently having been killed, but strangely returns to Berenza and Victoria's household later. He approaches Victoria and tells her to meet him in the garden. Victoria confesses her desire for Henriquez, and Zofloya claims he can help her fulfill any desire that she seeks. She is hesitant to take his help, but ultimately her desires take over her body and mind. Zofloya shares his knowledge of poisons and the two begin to plan the slow destruction of Berenza. As Berenza's health slowly declines, Zofloya advises Victoria to change locations since she is wary of being suspected of Berenza's poisoning. Victoria, Berenza, Henriquez, Lilla, and Lilla's elderly relative retreat to Berenza's mountain castle. Victoria is impatient for Berenza to die and questions Zofloya's methods. Zofloya mentions a poison he believes will kill Berenza immediately, but first he tests the poison on Lilla's elderly relative, who does not die immediately, and must be strangled by Zofloya. After two more weeks of waiting for Berenza to die, Victoria gives him his final ration of poison, and Berenza dies; the cause appears to be a heart attack. Berenza's death makes Henriquez suspicious. He begins to despise Victoria. In a moment of panic, Victoria confesses her love to Henriquez. He is harsh and cruel to her, but then realises that she was the wife of his brother, and he should contain his hatred for her. Victoria decides the only way to win his love is to eliminate Lilla. Zofloya and Victoria capture Lilla and tie her up in a cave. Henriquez is deeply upset when he discovers his lover is missing. Victoria confesses her love again, but Henriquez still refuses to reciprocate her emotion. Victoria runs to Zofloya, upset that he has not helped her attain her desires. He tells her she can have Henriquez if she appears to be Lilla. He gives her a potion to administer to Henriquez, which will make the first woman he sees when he awakens appear as the woman of his dreams. Zofloya fails to mention that the illusion will only last until Henriquez falls asleep again. Victoria gives Henriquez the potion and gets her wish of having him see her and love her as \\"Lilla\\" for a day. When they awaken in bed together the next morning, Henriquez realises that he had been wronged, and was with Victoria all night. He kills himself in response by jumping on a sword in his room. Victoria is furious with Zofloya for tricking her. In her passion, she stabs Lilla and throws her off a cliff. Victoria realises she is in Zofloya's thrall, and he seduces her with his words. He leads her to the banditti, led by her brother Leonardo. Zofloya and Victoria live among savages, and Zofloya shows his possessive evil side when he exclaims ‚Äúthou wilt be mine, to all eternity‚Äù (244) Zofloya begins showing a different side to himself, including an ability to read Victoria's thoughts. One night, the banditti bring a woman and man into their savage home. The woman and man turn out to be Laurina and Ardolph. Leonardo stabs Ardolph and proclaims that he has finally had his vengeance. Laurina is frightened by Leonardo's actions and, as a gasp escapes her lips, Leonardo turns back his attention to her. He demands to know which of the banditti have harmed her and caused the bruises and cuts she suffer from, but they tell him that it was Ardolph had been beating her and her cries had attracted their attention. On her deathbed, Laurina begs her children for their forgiveness. Victoria refuses, but Leonardo readily forgives her. Leonardo scorns Victoria for being so harsh to their mother. All the characters and their connecting stories come together in this final scene, and their unfortunate pasts surface. Leonardo and Megalena kill themselves, and Victoria is filled with guilt for all her past actions. She turns to Zofloya to tell him about her guilt, and instead of comforting her, he unmasks himself, thus revealing his hideous nature inside and out. He declares that he is Satan, and had tempted and used Victoria repeatedly. Victoria then gets annihilated by the Devil. Dacre ends the story with a short paragraph, commenting on the novel. She claims that her story is more than a romance. She comments on human nature, their passions and weakness, and \\"either the love of evil is born with us, or we must attribute them to the suggestions of infernal influence.\\"Dacre, Charlotte. Zofloya. New York; Oxford, 2000. Print. Characters Marchese di Loredani: husband to Laurina di Cornari and the father of Victoria and Leonardo.

The children blame her for all their misfortune throughout the novel. Victoria di Loredani: a beautiful woman who is very proud and self-sufficient. She is initially described as having an irrepressible spirit and lives a carefree life, with a twinge of a cruel nature. After her mother leaves her father, she becomes consumed by lust, revenge and temptation, which inevitably leads to the downfall of other characters. Leonardo di Loredani: son of Laurina and the Marchese, a year older than his sister Victoria, he is \\"unable to resist, in any shape, the temptations of his heart\\" He runs away from home when his mother leaves the family, and eventually is lost entirely to the power of his mistress Megalena.

He claims he can help Victoria fulfill her every wish and desire. He gives her poisons to destroy the lives of those around her. In the end, he reveals his true self; he is Satan. Ginotti: a small character who surfaces at the end of the novel as the leader of the soldiers. He is stabbed by Leonardo and used as an additional tragic effect in the novel. Banditti: robbers that appear in the end of the novel. Leonardo becomes their chief. Analysis of characters Zofloya, at times, reads more like a psychology manual than a novel in that many of the key characters appear to be archetypes of serious psychological disorders. Il Conte Berenza represents a model of perfectionism in his lust for Victoria. He requires constant validation of her love for him, despite his hypocritical opinion that their difference in class precludes the possibility of their marriage. He also requires complete ownership of both Victoria's body and her mind, \\"her absolute, her exclusive affection,‚ÄùZofloya. Charlotte Dacre. Ed. Adriana Cracium. p. 92. and a flawless body, mind and sense of honour: \\"She whom Berenza can love must tower above her sex‚Ä¶she must abound in the graces of mind as well as of body‚Ä¶if it be within the verge of possibility that she forfeit her honor, then ‚Äìoh! then, her blood alone can wash out her offence!\\"Zofloya. Charlotte Dacre. Ed. Adriana Cracium. p. 95. Count Ardolph fulfills many of the criteria for sadistic personality disorder as proposed in the Third Edition of American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, such as taking pleasure in the psychological suffering of others, lying for the purpose of inflicting pain on others, using violence to establish dominance in a relationship, and restricting the autonomy of people with whom he has a close relationship. Victoria seems to suffer from one or both of the following disorders: * Spoiled child syndrome, resulting in part from insufficient parental guidance and limitation. * Psychopathy, wherein an unusually low level of empathy is hidden behind a guise of fabricated normality. This is demonstrated throughout the novel as Victoria unsympathetically deceives Berenza with false declarations of love that are given solely for the purpose of her own future prospects. Analysis of the novel Questions of morality The chain of events in the novel teaches readers lessons about avoiding transgression. ‚ÄúFrom this work we gather that ladies, who marry very young, ought to take care not to fall in love with accomplished seducers; that in case such ladies should run away with their seducers, it will be particularly incumbent on their daughters not to turn out as bad as their mamas; and more especially, if the devil should appear to them in the shape of a very handsome black man,-they must not listen to him, for he will lead them from one crime to another‚ÄùNicholson, William . \\"ART.

Print. The same critic who summarises the lesson above does not assert it to be a tale of morality, proclaiming it as a mere \\"performance\\" of Dacre's imagination. \\"Zofloya has no pretension to rank as a moral work\\". Challenging feminine roles of the early 19th century Throughout the novel, strong female characters make their entry into the narrative. These female characters seem to embody a completely different image than that of the stereotypical female role within the gothic novel. Charlotte Dacre gives these female characters, specifically Victoria, Laurina, and Magalina Strozzi, a power and agency that is not found in many other gothic novels. Dacre gives these characters the ability to manipulate and use violence, something that had been a predominantly male characteristic throughout these novels, to fulfill their fantasies and lustsDunn, James. \\"Charlotte Dacre and the Feminization of Violence\\". University of California Press, 1998, p.309 Dacre uses violence to contrast the stereotyped opposition between male and female, drawing attention to her women who take matters into their own hands instead of silently suffering, as did many of the female characters of gothic novelsHarris, Robert. \\"Elements of the Gothic Novel\\". Robert Harris Press, 2010 Instead of being faint of heart and lacking any will of their own, Dacre presents Victoria, Laurina, and Megalina with an extreme sense of power, forcing their will through any means possible to achieve what they want, including the use of murder. Zofloya is known for its use of female characters that deviate from the standard notions of virtuous femininity in the early nineteenth century. The prominent female characters Victoria and her mother Laurina transgress in ways that were deemed inappropriate in this time period. Because of this, critics consider this novel as a deviation from the standard Gothic, and characterise it as a part of the Female Gothic. ‚ÄúDacre‚Äôs novel constitutes a strategically crafted and singular work of complex Female Gothic that speaks to its time by challenging various established views regarding women‚Äôs nature and roles‚Äù.Moreno, Beatriz Gonz√°lez. \\"GOTHIC EXCESS AND AESTHETIC AMBIGUITY IN CHARLOTTE DACRE'S ZOFLOYA.\\" Women's Writing 14.3 (2007): 419‚Äì434. Print. Dacre's act of hiding her authorship behind a pen name serves as a means of distancing herself from the accusation of writing material considered offensive, devious, and inappropriate for the nineteenth century. How the Female Characters Challenge Societal Roles Critics argue that Dacre's female characters challenge the standard roles through: # manipulation of the men # outright rejection of sensibilityChaplin, Sue. Law, Sensibility, and the Sublime in Eighteenth-Century Women's Fiction. Burlington: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2004. # exploration of sexual voyeurism # relationship control Victoria's manipulation of Berenza > ‚ÄúHer plan arranged she entered upon it gradually: her eyes, no longer full > of a wild and beautiful animation, were taught to languish or to fix for > hours with a musing air upon the ground‚Ä¶she no longer engrossed the > conversation; she became silent, apparently silent and plunged in thought.‚Äù > (78) Megalena as a sexual voyeurChaplin, Sue.

(112) Dacre also strengthens the dynamic of her female characters by making comparisons amongst them, specifically the comparison of Lilla and Victoria further on in the novel. Describing Victoria with, \\"dislike, from the very circumstance of her being so opposite [the] lovely mistress\\". Compare this, however, to the descriptions of Lilla as a, \\"beautous\\" and \\"fair\\" girl, the stereotypical characteristics given to female protagonists in many gothic novels. Lilla is blonde as Victoria is dark, as prepubescent, passive, good, as Victoria is the opposite...According to the code of ideology, Lilla should triumph over Victoria. The opposite occurs in this workHoeveler, Diane. \\"Gothic Feminism\\". St Martin's Press, 1995. Thus, Dacre pushes these completely opposite comparisons to further her attempt to totally invert the female-male dichotomy that was present in the 1700s and 1800s throughout Gothic literature. Familial roles Dacre also brings challenges to the conventional familial structure that most literature, Gothic included, often presented. At the very beginning of the novel, the father-figure is immediately removed from the family portrait as a result of an action taken by the female head of house, or Laurina. Again, it was a rare occurrence for a novel to sport a woman with enough agency to literally and figuratively remove the power of the male head of house. The novel continues, giving even more power to the mother figure, for Dacre describes that, \\"brilliant examples of virtue and decorum...[would have] counteracted the evils engendered by the want of steady attention to the propensities of children\\".Dacre, Charlotte. Zofloya. New York; Oxford, 2000. making note that it is the mother's character, and not the father's, that has true influence over the development of the child, and that without a good mother figure, the children will grow up without moral guidance or structure. Race and historical context Racism and the character Zofloya Zofloya is portrayed as a dark- skinned mysterious character that is later depicted as a representation of the devil. One of the novel's focuses is Zofloya's dark skin, arising from sentiments of xenophobia of the late nineteenth century. \\"In an age that was anxiously confronting foreignness as a threat, blackness was the ultimate fear\\".Schotland, Sara D.. \\"The Slave's Revenge: The Terror in Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya.\\" Western Journal of Black Studies 33.2 (2009): 123‚Äì131. Print. Race and interracial/cross-gender relationships The novel also evokes sentiments of race and power between dark-skinned men and fair-skinned women regarding the power relationship formed between two of the main characters, Zofloya and Victoria. Victoria and Zofloya forge a power relationship throughout the course of the novel which seems to upset the dominant fair-skinned, subservient dark-skinned hierarchy. This power relationship is characterised by the Moorish character Zofloya's superiority over the fair-skinned female character Victoria. \\"Zofloya reflects contemporary obsession about intercourse between black men and white women.\\" This \\"obsession\\" is credited to the forbidden nature of relationships between black women and men of the early nineteenth century.Mellor, Anne. \\"Interracial Sexual Desire in Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya.\\" European Romantic Review 13.2 (2002): 169‚Äì173. Print. Gothic novel and interracial/cross-gender relationships The gothic novel is a \\"safe\\" place to experiment with interactions between dark-skinned men and fair-skinned women. The genre of the Gothic has long enabled both its practitioners and its readers to explore subjective desires and identities that are otherwise repressed, denied or forbidden by the culture at large. =Zofloya and interracial/cross-gender relationships= The novel focuses on the heightened sexuality of the Moor Zofloya, while pairing this sexuality with the impotency of the other Caucasian male characters. \\"Aroused by the white male, white female sexual desire in this novel is repeatedly frustrated by that white male, who proves increasingly impotent as the novel unfolds. Count de Loredani cannot satisfy his wife, who elopes. Count Berenza, the vitiated libertine, cannot arouse or gratify his wife, and visibly wastes away before our eyes, poisoned by the lemonade he so adoringly drinks from his wife‚Äôs cup. Henriquez is besotted by the pale Lilla, but is unable to consummate his sexual desire for her, impaling himself instead on his own dagger. In the figural discourse of this text, white male bodies literally become smaller, weaker, less potent\\". As the story progresses, Victoria's views of Zofloya change. \\"Initially Victoria sees Zofloya only as her servant, the one who will carry out her wish to eliminate her husband and to seduce the rejecting Henriquez. But as the novel progresses, Victoria becomes more and more dependent on Zofloya, who repeatedly professes his own desire for her, kneeling before her, kissing her hand, preserving her bloodied handkerchief next to his heart, gently pressing her to his bosom, and insisting that she belongs to him\\". Catalysts for anti-African sentiment in the early 19th century Historical events of the early nineteenth century were responsible for perpetuating fears of xenophobia. The novel was written shortly after a major slave revolt in Saint- Domingue. The presence of this subverted power relationship in the novel paired with the demonic description of the Moorish character reflects a fear of future slave revolts. \\"Zofloya was written during a period of intense anxiety about slave revolt, especially the cataclysmic rebellion in Saint- Domingue\\". Dacre also plays to the idea of slavery, and the tendency of violence found amongst slaves. At this time period, slavery in the Caribbean become synonymous with violent uprisings and attempts at freedom, with slaves trying desperately to flee from their bondage and owners. In Zofloya, terror is built up in the idea of the \\"slave's revenge\\", which is catalogued by the actions of Zofloya himself.Schotland, Sara. \\"The Slave's Revenge: The Terror in Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya\\". Western Journal of Black Studies, 2009 Dacre builds up Zofloya's character with horrid acts and thoughts, playing upon the stereotypes often given to slaves. These evil deeds and actions, though they are contributed to Zofloya being the Devil himself at the end of the novel, actually prey upon the fear of the slave's revenge, which was an idea that had begun to develop amongst slave owners in the Caribbean. As a result of all the violence and horror afflicted upon the slaves by their owners, there was a fear of retribution that began to develop amongst the owners. It is this fear that Dacre preys upon by giving the only African character in the novel the most horrid qualities all linked with the idea of revenge, though she stealthily attempts to disguise these wants for revenge as solely Victoria's. This idea of fear contributed to Dacre's novel moving away from the characteristic definitions of fear and horror used in Gothic novels, pushing towards a new concept of fear; it was a concept of fear not designed wholly by qualities deemed unseemly to British culture during this time period, but fear based on what was occurring on an international scale in the colonies of the British. Role of patriarchal power As a common characteristic of Gothic novels, Dacre employs the use of characters that fit into a hierarchy chart, in other words there are both characters of high-ranking status and characters of low status. Some critics suggest that Dacre's novel Zofloya acts as an inversion of this social, patriarchal hierarchy where the characters of lower status hold the dominant power in the novel. The reversals of the servant/ master role eventually lead to the high ranked character's demise. \\"Subordinates, who are assumed to be totally transparent to their beneficent keepers, are actually the location of disguised and threatening knowledge; in Zofloya, this leads to one transgression after another as social and familiar underlying use the mask of harmless, familiar submission to disguise their insurrectionary aims.\\"199, Anolik Examples: Ardolph's seduction of Marchesa Laurina > \\"he found it necessary to degrade completely in her own eyes the miserable > and deluded Laurina.\\"(12)Dacre, Charlotte.

One character after another is seduced, this seduction leads them to their loss of power and control: > \\"What allows these seductions to occur is the knowledge that the > subordinates possess, both of themselves and of their superiors.\\" According to Burley, \\"The subordinate characters' knowledge and understanding about their master's sexuality allows them to use this knowledge as power to overthrow their master so they themselves become the master. The subordinates understanding of the power they possess also helps them to assert control over their superiors\\". Early on in the novel the reader see the subordinate character Ardolph, understanding of the power he possess and maximising the potential of this power: > \\"Endowed with a form cast in nature's finest mould, blest, or rather cursed, > with the abilities to astonish and enslave, possessed of every grace and > every charm that could render a man the most dangerous, or the most perfect > of his sex, he employed these rare and fascinating qualities, as a demon > would put on the semblance of an angel, to mislead and to betray.\\" Spoiled child in gothic literature Zofloya shares many characteristics with other English gothic novels, including John Moore‚Äôs Zeluco. Both novels focus on depraved main characters whose amoral exploits compose the bulk of the stories. Additionally, both Victoria and Zeluco have their parents to blame for their egocentric dispositions. Zeluco, though somewhat predisposed to violence and brutality from childhood, had been kept in check by his father. Upon his father's death, Zeluco was left solely in the care of his mother. Moore, John. Zeluco. Ed. Pam Perkins. Kansas City: Valancourt Books, 2008. 4. Similarly, after her mother elopes with Count Ardolph, Victoria is left with her heartbroken father who cannot bear to limit her in any way: Zofloya. Charlotte Dacre. Ed. Adriana Cracium. p. 48. Parallels between Zofloya and Matthew Lewis's The Monk The novel is criticised for too closely mirroring The Monk, a prominent Gothic Novel published ten years before by Matthew Lewis. The novel ‚Äúmaintains a plot not remarkable for its art nor striking in its management, but so closely imitated to Lewis's Monk, as to force the reader upon a comparison between the two works, incomparably to the prejudice of the one before us‚Äù. Other critics have asserted that the demon character of Matilda is paralleled by the character Zofloya. ‚ÄúNot only does Dacre reverse the gender of the characters from The Monk but she also changes the race of the arch-villain, insisting on the darkness of Zofloya's skin‚Äù. Both Zofloya and The Monk are criticised for employing scenes of sexual transgression that was seen as offensive in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century; However, Zofloya was received with greater criticism because its author was female. ‚ÄúWhen Lewis wrote The Monk it was not welcomed, but it was conceivable that a man could write this sort of infernal thing; however Dacre's crime was greater because it was inconceivable that a woman could even imagine such horrors and use such voluptuous language‚Äù. Pen name of Dacre linked to The Monk Some critics claim that Dacre's use of the pen name \\"Rosa Matilda\\" is \\"a clear reference to the demon woman who tempts and seduces the depraved monk Ambrosio in Matthew Lewis's The Monk\\". Note on the names According to editor Kim Iam Michasiw, \\"Charlotte Dacre's acts of naming both herself and her characters in Zofloya specify her debts to earlier Gothic novels.\\" Victoria di Loredani * The surname \\"Loredani\\" pays homage to Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho character Signora di Lorentini, who courted and murdered by a villain named Montoni. * The name Victoria is most likely derived from William Henry Ireland's The Abbess: A Romance , in which he has a female character named Vittoria, who much like Dacre's Victoria \\"is a licentious seductress who specializes in aphrodisiac potions.\\" Signora Montoni * \\"A role as gaoler and voice of conventional society closely approximates that of Emily in St. Aubert's aunt Madame Cheron, later Signora Montoni, in The Mysteries of Udolpho, bears a suspiciously similar name.\\" Terror vs. horror The enduring question of terror versus horror is very much alive in discussion and analysis of Zofloya. Very much like others in the English gothic genre, the story cannot be relegated entirely into either school. To better understand the sensations of terror evoked by Zofloya, examine this example of horror in Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. When Manfred's son is crushed by an enormous helmet on the eve of his wedding, Manfred begins to pursue his son's would-be wife with maniacal intensity, tormenting and detaining her while he attempts to arrange his nefarious plans.Walpole, Horace. The Castle of Otranto. Middlesex, England: Penguin English Library, 1968. There is no suggestion or insinuation in Manfred‚Äôs motivations ‚Äì he plans to forcibly initiate and consummate a marriage with a reluctant and pure-hearted maiden. Zofloya subjects the reader to a several-hundred page affair between an upper-class Caucasian woman, Victoria, and a dark-skinned servant, Zofloya, wherein Zofloya assists Victoria with the murder of her husband through the use of poison. As Victoria‚Äôs husband slowly withers away from the poison, Victoria develops an all-encompassing sexual attraction to Zofloya. During the era in which Zofloya was first published, this affair represented \\"perhaps the most taboo of all human sexual desires in Romantic- era England, the passionate, even uncontrollable, sexual desire of a beautiful white woman for the black male body.\\" As is the case with many subjects concerning Zofloya, the word \\"affair\\" can only be used loosely, because their relationship technically remains unconsummated. Despite the unusually nonphysical nature of the affair, the 18th century reader's imagination paints a sordid picture of the relationship, even without explicit depictions of overt sexuality. Where Castle of Otranto explicitly documents instances of universally recognised evil, Zofloya tends to allude to instances of more subjective, controversial moral standing. The significance of suggestion in terror is what separates it from the more obvious devices of horror. English gothic author Ann Radcliffe differentiates the two in a passage from The Supernatural in Poetry: Ann Radcliffe, On the Supernatural in Poetry, New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal, 16:61 (1826:Jan.) p.145 The dilemma of terror versus horror in Gothic literature is very closely related to the contemporary discussion of erotica versus pornography, wherein the suggestive nature of erotica may evoke sensations and emotions that are not shared with the explicit nature of pornography. In fact, Michael Gamer claims \\"pornography and gothic have overlapping constitutive histories and share attributes best revealed through the genres‚Äô reception histories.\\"Gamer, Michael. \\"Genres for the prosecution: Pornography and the gothic.\\" PMLA. Publications of the Modern Language Association of America 114.5 Oct 1999. 1043‚Äì54. ProQuest Research Library. Database. 15 April 2011. Critical reception Zofloya was considered pornographic by contemporary critics. The July 1806 issue of Monthly Literary Recreations said that Zofloya was \\"a romance so void of merit, so destitute of delicacy, displaying such depravity of morals, as the present.\\"Zofloya. Charlotte Dacre. Ed. Adriana Cracium. p. 261. . Despite such criticisms, the novel sold well and was translated into French and German. According to Carol Margaret Davison, Zofloya \\"received little scholarly attention\\" although it has gained consideration in the past two decades for its gender dynamics. Critics were offended by the vulgar content that Dacre included. The Monthly Literary Recreations claimed that, ‚Äúthere has seldom appeared a romance so void of merit, so destitute of delicacy, displaying such disgusting depravity of morals as [Zofloya].‚ÄùMonthly Literary Reactions (July 1806); print. Dacre was accused of \\"murdering the English language\\" due to her tendency of \\"applying extravagant language to common things\\"The New Annual Register (1806); print. Other critics even bashed Dacre's state of mind. The Literary Journal declared that ‚Äúit evidently appears that our fair authoress must have been strongly attacked by the disease when she wrote these volumes and treated by the Devil, English, and common sense so scurvily.Literary Journal (June 1806); print. Critics assert that the novel intends to lay \\"a variety of crimes to the charge of the devil\\" which they assert arise not from the devil, but rather from the sickened mind of Dacre. The vulgarity of the novel was discussed further because of Dacre's gender, and the shock of the content escaping from a female pen. ‚ÄúThere is a voluptuousness of language and allusion which we should have hoped, that the delicacy of the female pen would have refused to trace.‚ÄùAnnual Review (1806); print. Some literary critics were in favour of Dacre's characterisation of women. ‚ÄúCast in a different mould than those of her precursors, her heroines do not exhibit any elegance or artificiality of diction, nor coy daintiness of mien, nor any inveterate ingenuousness of character‚Ä¶Miss Dacre's women are not one- dimensional beings concerned with propriety or taste. They think, feel and reason.‚ÄùThe Passions, I, vii‚Äìviii (1972); print Some literary critics suggest that Zofloya is not a text which provides readers with any type of moral substance. All the action that would appear to carry some sort of moral lesson is in fact overshadowed by the entertainment the novel warrants. ‚ÄúZofloya has no pretension to rank as a moral work. As a work of imagination or entertainment it will be read with some interest from the immediate incidents and the manner in which they are treated. Its merits as a whole or entire composition are very slender.‚ÄùLiterary Journal Monthly 1 (1806): 631‚Äì35. British Periodicals.

In January 1989, Epson launched its first 3LCD projector, the VPJ-700. Although Epson still owns 3LCD technology, it is marketed by an affiliated organization simply named after the technology:\\"3LCD\\". The organization is a consortium of projector manufacturers that have licensed 3LCD technology to be used in their products. To date, about 40 different projector brands worldwide have adopted 3LCD technology. According to electronics industry research company Pacific Media Associates, projectors using 3LCD technology comprised about 51% of the world's digital projector market in 2009.3LCD Group Press Release, March 11, 2010: 3LCD Announces Worldwide Market Share Leadership in 2009 3LCD technology gets its name from the three LCD panel chips used in its image generation engine.  How 3LCD technology works  Creating Colors from White Light: A projector using 3LCD technology works by first splitting the white light from the lamp into its three primary colors of red, green and blue by passing the lamp light through special dichroic filter / reflector assemblies called ‚Äúdichroic mirrors.‚Äù Each dichroic mirror only allows specific colored wavelengths of light to pass through while reflecting the rest away. In this way, the white light is split into its three primary color beams and each is directed toward, and subsequently through its own LCD panel. Image Generation at the LCDs: The three LCD panels of the projector are the elements that receive the electronic signals to create the image which is to be projected. Each pixel on an LCD is covered by liquid crystals. By changing the electrical charge given to the liquid crystals, each pixel on an LCD can be darkened until it is totally opaque (for full black), lightened until it is totally transparent (allowing all the lamp light to pass through for full white) or shaded in varying degrees of translucence (for different shades of gray). This is similar to how a digital watch‚Äôs characters appear bold and black on its LCD when its battery is new, but start to fade gradually as its battery weakens. In this way, the brightness level on every pixel for each primary color can be very precisely controlled to produce the final pixel's specific color and brightness level required on the screen. Color Image Recombination and Projection: After each colored light is filtered through its individual LCD panel, the beams are recombined in a dichroic prism that forms the final image which is then reflected out through the lens.  Competition  For mainstream projectors, the competitors to 3LCD technology are single-chip DLP technology (developed by Texas Instruments) and to a much lesser extent, LCOS projection technology.  Advantages  Proponents of 3LCD projection technology claim that it has the following advantages over it closest competing technologies: * 3LCD projectors can have higher color light output than single-chip DLP projectors. This is because 3LCD projectors mix and project the light beams from all three colors to form each individual pixel's color, while single-chip DLP projectors create colors by projecting them in sequence one at a time and rely on human color perception to mix and interpret the correct colors for each pixel. * 3LCD projectors typically use less power compared to a single- chip DLP projectors of the same brightness rating. * The way a single-chip DLP projector works sometimes causes viewers to see a \\"rainbow\\" or \\"color breakup\\" effect where false colors are briefly perceived when either the image or the observer's eye is in motion. As all three primary colors are displayed all the time by 3LCD projectors, they do not suffer from this effect. * 3LCD projectors are able to display finer image gradations by giving each pixel on the projected image a smooth variation in brightness levels. This is because the liquid crystals for each pixel on an LCD panel can be given fine levels of opacity by varying the electrical charge. On the other hand, a single-chip DLP projector has a single mirror reflecting the lamp light to the lens on its DMD chip for each pixel. It varies the brightness of each pixel by vibrating the mirror between its on or off state in varying frequencies and relies on human perception to interpret the brightness of each pixel. * 3LCD projectors are typically more affordable than those using LCOS or 3-chip DLP technologies.  Disadvantages  * Older 3LCD projectors with large pixel pitches usually have a \\"screen door effect\\" * Single-chip DLP projectors typically have higher contrast ratios compared to older 3LCD models of similar price or brightness rating. * The smallest single-chip DLP projectors are smaller than the smallest 3LCD projector models. * Current LCOS projector models typically deliver sharper images at higher resolutions than 3LCD projectors.

History\\" retrieved September 26, 2017 His father died in 1961 and Richard succeeded him as CEO. Smith changed the company's name to General Cinema in 1964 to better reflect the shift in the industry away from drive-in theaters. Smith diversified and expanded the company through acquisitions. In the late 1960s, General Cinema began purchasing bottling franchises eventually becoming the largest independent bottler in the United States. In 1970, they purchased the Mann Theatres chain (founded by Ted Mann) for $6.6 million. In 1972, they purchased an interest in 47 indoor theaters in Louisiana and Florida from the Loews Corporation (founded by Laurence Tisch and Robert Tisch) for $16 million. Smith's diversification efforts paid off: in 1985, the bottling operations were 70% of operating profits and General Cinema marked its 12th straight year of operating profits (since Smith was appointed CEO, General Cinema had been profitable for 24 of 25 years). Smith also participated in greenmailing: he purchased a substantial interest in Heublein Inc. forcing it to find a friendly suitor earning Smith a substantial profit when he sold his shares. In 1984, General Cinema purchased a controlling interest in Carter Hawley Hale, the tenth largest clothing retailer in the United States and owner of the Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman- Marcus, John Wanamaker's, Thalhimers, and Holt Renfrew chains, saving it from a hostile takeover from Leslie Wexner. In 1989, General Cinema sold its bottling division for $1.75 billion. In 1991, General Cinema purchased Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for $1.5 billion. In 1993, the company split into two companies: Harcourt General consisted of the publishing business and the controlling interest in the retail group (then called the Neiman-Marcus Group); and GC Companies, Inc. consisted of the movie theater division in which the Smith family retained a 28 percent controlling interest. In 1994, Smith re-evaluated the portfolio of theaters and sold 14 theaters for $14 million and closed an additional 37 theaters in 1994 and 12 in 1995. They also cautiously expanded into megaplexes with sit-down cafes, seat-side service, \\"loveseats,\\" gourmet food and coffee, and liquor; and associated with top brands such as Starbucks, Pepsi, Taco Bell, and Pizzeria Uno. In 2000, General Cinema sold Harcourt General to publisher Reed-Elsevier for $5.7 billion and in 2005, they sold Neiman Marcus to private equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus for $5.1 billion (the Smith family earned $600 million from their interest).Forbes: \\"(Richard Alan) Smith family\\" retrieved September 24, 2017 Philanthropy He and his wife founded the Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation.Boston Globe: \\"Susan Smith, 83; philanthropist‚Äôs passion transformed cancer care\\" By Bryan Marquard August 2, 2016 Personal life In 1952, Smith married Susan Flax who was Jewish.Legacy.com: \\"SUSAN M.

It is one of a very small number of octopuses to exhibit bioluminescence. Taxonomy The cirrate octopuses are deep sea species that have been relatively little studied. Some have been described on the basis of a single, poorly preserved specimen, and this makes deducing their phylogenetic relationships difficult.Taxonomy of the deep-sea octopods Ocean Research Laboratory. Retrieved 2011-10-04. Some authorities adopt the traditional view that the genus Stauroteuthis is part of the family Stauroteuthidae that is characterized by the presence of a secondary web. The World Register of Marine Species, however, considers that it should be placed in the family Cirroteuthidae, basing this decision on ribosomal DNA and other evidence, and that Stauroteuthidae is a synonym of this family. Description The mantle length of Stauroteuthis syrtensis is about and its width about . The fins are some in width. The eight arms are of unequal length, the longest extending to about . These are joined for two-thirds of their length by two webs, a dorsal complete membrane and a ventral partial one, giving the animal an umbrella-like shape. The number of adhesive suckers ranges from 55 to 65. These suckers vary in size and distance among males and females. However, suckers generally decrease in diameter and distance as they extend down the arm. Female suckers reach a maximum diameter of 6.5 mm at suckers 1 to 3 while male suckers, on the other hand, are relatively larger. Between suckers 8 to 25 there are conspicuous cirri. These are elongate, fleshy tendrils borne on the sides of the oral surface of the arms, the longest being at sucker 20 which can be up to 50 mm in length.Stauroteuthis syrtensis - Verrill 1879 The Tree of Life Web Project.

A vestigial, U-shaped, internal shell supports the fins, the only other hard part of the animal being the two-part beak.Stauroteuthis Encyclopedia of Life. Retrieved 2011-10-04. Distribution Stauroteuthis syrtensis is found in the North Atlantic at an extreme depth range of . It is most frequently found a few hundred metres from the bottom of the ocean at depths between . It seems to be fairly common off the edge of the continental shelf on the eastern coast of the United States, and has also been observed at similar depths off the British Isles. Bioluminescence Stauroteuthis is one of only two genera of octopuses to exhibit bioluminescence. S. syrtensis emits a blue-green light from about 40 modified suckers known as photophores situated in a single row between the pairs of cirri on the underside of each arm. The distance between these decreases towards the ends of the arms with the light becoming fainter. The animal does not emit light continuously, but can do so for a period of five minutes after suitable stimulation. Some of the photophores emit a continuous stream of faint light, while others are much brighter and switch on and off in a cyclical pattern, producing a twinkling effect. The function of the bioluminescence is believed to be for defence, being used by the animal to scare off predators, and also as a lure for the planktonic crustaceans that form its main diet. The light may also be used for sexual signaling, but this is considered to be an unlikely function, as the light is deployed by both sexes and by immature, as well as mature, individuals.

He is one of only four players born in what is now the Republic of Ireland to play for Rangers; the others were Alex Stevenson, Jon Daly and James Lowry McAuley. Career Club Galway-born Craig joined Rangers from junior side Rutherglen Glencairn in January 1905. His initial seasons at Ibrox coincided with a rare lean spell, and he left without a single major winner's medal.Rangers player Craig, Alec, FitbaStats The closest he came was in 1905 when Rangers lost a replayed Scottish Cup final 3‚Äì1 to Third Lanark. In his final season, 1910‚Äì11, Rangers did win the League title, but Craig made just a single appearance and so was not entitled to a medal. By the time of his move to Greenock Morton, Craig was proving his versatility by slotting in regularly on the left-hand side of defence. In May 1914 he returned to Ibrox, making his second debut in a Glasgow Merchant's Cup Final defeat by Celtic. He was a regular in the Gers side for the initial war-time campaign and was still on the club's books when hostilities ended though his last appearances were made in April 1916. Still without a significant club honour, Craig finished his playing days in the Western League with Johnstone. International Craig's international career began as he reaped the benefits of Billy McCracken's expulsion by the Irish FA. He made his Ireland debut in a 3‚Äì1 defeat by England in February 1908, playing in each of that year's British Home Championship ties at right-back. But it was at left-back that Craig played during each of the 1914 Home Championship games as Ireland claimed the title outright for the first time.

Rubanisation stems from the belief that the continued consideration of the rural and the urban as two distinct realms is unsustainable in terms of social justice, cultural justice and environmental justice. This mode of thinking calls for a new spatial geometry of integrated development that offers real viable choices for living, one that is supported by environmentally sustainable technology and ethical lifestyle.  Viable choice  > \\"Urbanism has been blind to the plight of the countryside for too long, and > the tide is turning as we face the global financial crisis and climate > change.

Singapore > Architect, No.246, 2008, pp. 60. In Rubanisation, a reverse migration back to the village is encouraged and made possible through the availability of viable choice, prior to returning to repair the city devastated by unjust accumulation. Focusing on the problems of existing mega-cities is only a stop-gap solution. The argument is that in the present mode of development, the countryside has been largely neglected as cities become 'the exclusive focus of development,'Tay, Kheng Soon. Behold the countryside: the urban/rural divide. Global Asia, Vol. 3, No. 3, Fall 2008, pp. 48-55. compelling those in the rural areas to migrate to the city in search of better opportunities. This has resulted in a massive population explosion in most cities in the developing world, which manifests itself in the growing presence of slums.Lim, William S. W. Social and spatial justice for slum and city dwellers. 23 Oct 2009. In the case of developed societies, small towns and villages have been losing population to the lure of the big cities for the excitement that they offer. Rubanisation postulates that unless the problem of rural poverty, which 'still remains the main cause for mass rural-urban migration,'Lim, William S. W. Social and spatial justice for slum and city dwellers. is solved, and people given a real choice in deciding between rural and urban living, the problems of urbanisation remain intractable.  Spatial geometry  Ruban settlements can be conceived as 'infrastructurally autonomous cells existing within a web of nature, farms, transport, communication and informational interconnectivity.'Tay, Kheng Soon. 'Rubanisation': The re-conceptualisation of human settlements in harmony with the environment. 12 Nov 2008. http://www.rubanisation.org/2008/11/rubanisation-re-conceptualisation-of.html Each of these cells should not have a radius larger than 500 metres - taken to be the optimal walking distance - with its density and use-mix determined by its location, environment and economic requirements. (The minimum density for a cell, however, is based on the size needed to support the local school population, which is the priority.) Energy-wise each cell is encouraged to be as autonomous as possible, by generating its own power, collecting and processing its own water supply and treating its own organic and inorganic waste.Tay, Kheng Soon. 'Rubanisation': The re-conceptualisation of human settlements in harmony with the environment. Socially every cell is provided with its own schools, health facilities, shops, workplaces, and basic services, all of which fall within walking distance. In this way Rubanisation ensures that every person or family is able to enjoy a high quality of life, with a choice of lifestyle, livelihood and location. Not everybody wants to live in the city, or necessarily in the countryside. At every stage of life, there should be viable choice; a no-choice situation is a crime against humanity. These autonomous cells are then scattered in the landscape, accommodating geographical and environmental specificities. The boundaries of the cells are more or less circular to allow for the spaces between them to be farms, and this spacing would vary according to settlement densities and open land requirements. In every case, however, provisions are made for green spaces, farms, water bodies, etc. between the cells even when they are closely packed in dense urbanised settings, to allow fresh farm produce to be locally available. While specific modifications and adaptations will be made according to density requirements, 'the cellular nature of the settlement pattern remains the primary system of spatial organisation ensuring both efficiency and liveability,' and 'the old contestation between green and brown sites in urban planning dictated by economic imperatives is thus finally eliminated by this geometry.'Tay, Kheng Soon. 'Rubanisation': The re-conceptualisation of human settlements in harmony with the environment. Human settlements would then be interspersed between an interconnected green web of farms and natural areas throughout the world.  Existing cities  Rubanisation does not seek to eliminate the need for cities. Rather, it merely presents people with a viable alternative to the city as it presently is. Existing cities should be retained for five overarching functions:Tay, Kheng soon. Presentation given at the Department of Architecture, National University of Singapore. 2 Sep 2009. http://www.rubanisation.org/2009/09/blog-post.html # the highest level of medical research and treatment # the highest level of academic research and teaching # the highest level of finance and administration # the highest level of entertainment and the arts # the highest level of manufacturing Modifications to existing cities can and will occur over time as the concept of distributed Rubanised settlements develops. Through the selective insertion of green spaces and water bodies into the existing dense urban fabric, over time, the green web will be established throughout.  Transport  New transport systems utilising robotic electric buses serve as the transport backbone, to be supplemented by small private electric vehicles belonging to the family or the individual. To maximise road space efficiency, all robotic vehicles are linked together magnetically to form a train whereby each vehicle is able to connect to or disconnect from the train automatically. This provides the sort of flexibility required that fixed rail systems do not. Roads are divided into four categories depending on their width, the traffic density and types of vehicles they are meant to take, in order to eliminate road congestion. This system builds upon the existing roadway systems.  A new eco-regional economy  Presently, economic patterns of production and consumption are environmentally destructive, and so new non-material satisfactions have to be found in life to wean people off the present satisfactions based on material consumption. In a Ruban setting, these new satisfactions take the form of better education, a high quality of environment and improved family and community life. The individualistic and materialistic values perpetrated by the current developmental model ought to incorporate traditional values of compassion, humility, care for others and the environment, as the basis for a new eco-regional economy.  Work, live, learn, play, farm  The impact of Rubanisation goes beyond poverty eradication, by bringing greater balance to working, living, learning, playing and farming within walkable distances. 'Children walk to school. Parents work nearby. Children know what their parents do. Parents are involved in their children's learning situations. Communities interact to imagine new ways to make life better and more secure. Everyone enjoys good clean organic food, know the farmers by name, know how the food is grown and adjust their diet according to seasonable crops.'Tay, Kheng Soon. The ruban vision. 6 May 2009. http://www.rubanisation.org/2009/05/ruban-vision.html The good life will be restored through real creative community action, fulfilling work, and stronger family ties.  The architecture  In the Rubanisation model, local initiative and incremental action are encouraged. Therefore, totalistic designs are abhorrent. Within the overall Ruban pattern which governs the infrastructure and land-use planning, the implementation of building projects are governed by local environmental concerns and individual creativity within the shared values of the settlement. Local materials and techniques should characterise the design style. This would tend towards a natural localism, avoiding the tendency to copy the industrial aesthetics of the 'defunct age.'Tay, Kheng Soon. The ruban vision.

The boundaries of the BRZ includes only the \\"commercial strips\\" within those enclaves, and the BRZ itself straddles the official neighbourhoods of McCauley and Boyle Street. History Chung Kee or John Kee, was the first Chinese to settle in Edmonton, arriving by stage-coach from Calgary in late May 1890 to establish a laundry. In 1899 there were only 13 Chinese men in Edmonton, one restaurant and two laundries, about half lived in Strathcona. By the early 1900s a small Chinatown began to emerge after several Chinese merchants arrived to establish their businesses at the intersection of Namayo Street (contemporary 97 Street) and Rice Street (contemporary 101A Avenue). By 1911 the original 13 Chinese people residing in Edmonton had swelled to 154 (150 males, 4 females) and by 1921 it increased further to 518 (501 males, 17 females). From covering an area of 3 city blocks in 1911 (bounded by Jasper and Elizabeth Avenue as well as Fraser and Namayo Street, to expanding eastward as far as Kinistino Street (Modern 95 Street). Despite this substantial increase in size of the Chinese community, the Chinese people still only accounted for 1% of Edmonton's population. In 1911, some 150 Chinese happily greeted the Xinhai Revolution by cutting off their queues and celebrating, although Sun Yat Sen did not visit Edmonton, he did visit Calgary in February 1911. In 1913, when Sun left the government of Yuan Shikai, Chinese Edmontonians formed a \\"Dare to Die Brigade\\" to go to China and support him. Trained by Morris Cohen (also known as General Two-Gun Cohen) they never got the chance to go to China, as Sun fled to Japan. In 1914, at the start of the First World War the Dare to Die Brigade offered to go to Europe to fight, however their request was turned down and they were disbanded. When Dr. Sun Yat Sen died in 1925, a large memorial service was held in Edmonton. Edmonton's current Chinatown consists of two parts, Chinatown South is the older part, easily recognized by the presence of the Harbin Gate and other Chinese-themed street furniture. Chinatown North lies just to the north of its older counterpart. Chinatown North also includes a large Vietnamese presence, and blends into the multicultural \\"Avenue of Nations\\" (107 Ave) which runs east-to-west along the northern edge of both Chinatown and Little Italy. The Edmonton Remand Centre located at 9660 - 104 Avenue is in the process of being closed and relocated to a new facility at 127 Street & 186 Avenue in early 2013.

Spetzler (born 1944) is a neurosurgeon and the J.N. Harber Chairman Emeritus of Neurological Surgery and Director Emeritus of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. He retired as an active neurosurgeon in July 2017.Michael Lawton to succeed Spetzler He is also Professor of Surgery, Section of Neurosurgery, at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson, Arizona. Spetzler specialized in cerebrovascular disease and skull base tumors. Extremely prolific, he has published more than 300 articles and 180 book chapters and has co-edited multiple neurosurgical textbooks, including The Color Atlas of Microneurosurgery (2000). Biography Spetzler can be seen standing in the middle Spetzler was born in Stierh√∂fstetten (Oberscheinfeld, near W√ºrzburg) in Germany to where his parents had been evacuated due to the Second World War. When he was 11, he moved with his parents to the United States. He performed spectacularly in the American school system, despite the fact his first language was German. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1967 from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois after attending a year of community college in Illinois. He spent a year at the Free University of Berlin, and then entered medical school at the Northwestern Medical School in Chicago in 1967, receiving his M.D. in 1971. He completed post-graduate training at Wesley Memorial Hospital‚ÄìNorthwestern and a residency in neurosurgery at the University of California, San Francisco, training under Charles B. Wilson.http://www.cns.org/about/history/honoredGuests/default.aspx?inID=1994 In 1983, Spetzler was named Chair of the Division of Neurological Surgery at Barrow Neurological Institute. He was named director in 1986. Spetzler played a dominant role in the use of the standstill operation in treating large or dangerous cerebral aneurysms. One notable application of this method occurred in 1991 when Spetzler successfully removed a large aneurysm in a 35-year-old American woman named Pam Reynolds. Prior to the operation proceeding, Reynolds was placed under general anesthesia, then had her eyes taped shut and a monitoring device placed in both of her ears. She was later induced into clinical death by Spetzler and his team, which was necessary for the operation to take place. Despite being clinically dead and under intense monitoring and medical observation whilst the procedure was ongoing, Reynolds claimed to have had a profound near-death experience in which she was able to accurately recall the sequence of events within the operating theater, the surgical instruments used, and the conversations that had taken place. In an interview that took place for a BBC documentary in 2002, Spetzler affirmed many of the observations that Pam had made and later admitted that he had no explanation for them. In February 2007, Spetzler performed his 5,000th aneurysm procedure. He travels and lectures frequently on the most recent advances in neurosurgery.

It is one of the pseudo- oxocarbon anions, as it can be described as a derivative of the croconate oxocarbon anion through the replacement of three oxygen atoms by dicyanomethylene groups =C(‚àíC‚â°N)2. The term Croconate Blue as a dye name specifically refers to the dipotassium salt . History and synthesis The anion was synthesized and characterized by A. Fatiadi in 1978, together with croconate violet. He obtained the corresponding acid, croconate acid blue by treating croconic acid with malononitrile in water solution at 80‚Äì90 ¬∞C. Alexander J.

It crystallizes from water as a purple sesquihydrate ¬∑ and gives a red solution in acetone or ethanol, but deep blue in water. It hydrolyzes slowly in water to give croconic acid violet. Extended heating in water produces deep green plates, apparently a polymer. Croconate acid blue retains the aromatic character and some other properties of the croconate anion. Lawrence M. Doane, Alexander J. Fatiadi (1981) \\"Electrochemical Oxidation of Croconate Salts; Evidence of the Chemical Equivalence of the Carbonyl Oxygen Atom and the Dicyanomethylene Group\\" Croconate blue dianion Unlike croconate violet, the croconate blue dianion is not planar; the three dicyanomethylene groups are twisted by about 30 degrees from the ring plane. The dipotassium salt is obtained from the acid by treatment with potassium methoxide from water as a green-blue trihydrate, that slowly loses water converting to the dihydrate. The water solutions have an intense blue color. It quickly converts to croconate violet when treated with potassium hydroxide. It is a weak semiconductor with conductivity 10‚àí7 S cm‚àí1 at room temperature. The bis(tetramethylammonium) salt ((CH3)4)2 is green-blue and crystallizes as the dihydrate.

Release of the game has been pushed back from the originally intended 2010 to 2011, but after development was rebooted no further release dates were ever announced by the developers. After years of troubled development, the developers announced in 2017 the game would no longer have any references to NeoGAF, directly in response to a MeToo controversy surrounding the website, and that all the work put into the project would be reused under a new developer name. However, no further updates about those plans were ever issued. Some of the level design was salvaged and released in 2015 as 2 user-made levels in Super Mario Maker, making these the only playable content ever released from this project. It was intended to parody modern military shooter video games, and contrary to its name, is not a sequel to any previously released game title. The developers, however, had come up with a fictional series of non-existing prequels. Plot The game would have followed the story of B.R.O. Alliance Forces members John Dudebro and his sidekick, Habemus Chicken. At the start of the game a briefing with the B.R.O. Alliance General Dawgless Lee takes place, where the protagonists are shown a polaroid picture of the eye-scarred and mustachioed Armando Pesquali. Pesquali is a terrorist known to have been selling illegal weapons in the Middle East. Dudebro and Chicken are then tasked to find the man and stop his arms trade. Gameplay John Dudebro standing below the game title in a forest area from the Alaska chapter. The game was a 2D side-scrolling shooter that utilized 8 bit styled retro pixel art, and modern features such as complex physics and video post processing techniques. John Dudebro, controlled by the player, would have traversed hostile environments filled with enemies to proceed through the game. Movement and actions are all controlled with the keyboard or a game controller. These actions include shooting, slicing, changing weapons, picking up objects, throwing objects, and more. Dudebro's health bar, named Brodiocity Meter, refills when the player performs certain tasks, such as killing enemies, rescuing ladies or drinking beer. When the player is using a game controller, Dudebro can switch weapons in real time with a weapon wheel. The game would have featured a number of different environments, set in different locations around the world, with complex layouts reminiscent of other games in the Metroidvania genre. By exploring each environment, Dudebro can acquire additional weapons and gear, and collect medals which are used to access boss fights and unlock subsequent chapters. Some boss fights are concluded with a button mashing quick time event named Fist Bump Finisher. The humorous tone of the game would have permeated multiple aspects of the gameplay, as several elements are explicitly designed to spoof and subvert common tropes from the modern action and shooter video game genres. The gameplay debut trailer, for instance, mocks forced hacking minigames and the ability to only carry a maximum of two weapons at the same time, both common in modern first person shooters: in the game, the first can be skipped by pressing a button, and the latter gets laughed at by the main characters during a cutscene. Development Dudebro began with an offhand comment made by a user named Cuyahoga on the NeoGAF forum. Cuyahoga made up the title to mock another user who accused him of being a pedophile because he purchased and enjoyed the game Imagine: Babyz Fashion. The title was a source of inspiration, and the NeoGAF users Jocchan, Thetrin and Mik2121 took the initiative in the actual conception of the game. They were then followed by a large number of posters who began discussions, collaborating on the ideas and assets for a real game. Eventually, Will Goldstone (who wrote a book on Unity) became involved with programming. The newborn project caught immediately the attention of the gaming press. The NeoGAF users were able to get Jon St. John to voice the titular character, John Dudebro. St. John is notable for being the voice actor for the character Duke Nukem in the Duke Nukem game franchise. The game, originally scheduled for release in summer 2010, was later pushed to 2011. Currently, Dudebro's application source code is open to all NeoGAF members who are willing to contribute to the game's improvement. At one point, the name the group of developers use (\\"Grimoire Assembly Forge\\") drew threats of a lawsuit because of an alleged trademark infringement of \\"Grimoire\\", a role- playing game developed and published by Grimoire Systems Pty. Ltd.http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?p=22516467#post22516467  Cancelled top-down version  The game was originally set to be released as a 3D top-down shooter presented in a 3rd person perspective, with 2D sprite- based characters in 3D environments, developed with the Unity engine. The player was meant to controls Dudebro's movement with the keyboard and aim with the mouse. Weapons and upgrades would have been available through the player environment. The gameplay was mission-based, with each map offering a certain number of missions that needed be completed in order to unlock the level's boss door. Missions were accessed by touching medal-shaped markers scattered across the map and accepted in a subsequent prompt, and they could involve changes in level design, weapon sets and enemy spawns. Mission objectives could involve killing enemies, doing speedruns, saving girls, finding hidden objects or surviving for a set amount of time. Completing each mission would award the user a medal, and some of them unlock new paths in the level to give the player access to more missions or allow easier backtracking. Completed missions and levels could be replayed anytime, and unlocked paths would stay unlocked in subsequent playthroughs. The game later switched to a 2D side- scrolling version after multiple dropouts left the team too understaffed to continue development.  Super Mario Maker levels  In 2015, the development team released two levels for Super Mario Maker, named \\"Super Dude Bros.‚Ñ¢ II Chapter 1-1: Dawgs of War\\" and \\"Super Dude Bros. II Chapter 1-2: There Will Be B.R.Oil\\". Two official posts from the official developer blog detailed the plot of the custom levels, a rarity for user-generated content for Super Mario Maker even among other professional developers. It is the year 2015. Supah Mariobro, a heroic plumber from B.R.O. Alliance, embarks on a grand adventure to rescue his beloved Brincess Beach from the greedy paws of the KooPro professional terrorist organization. Then Supah Mariobro follows Dudebro‚Äôs steps through a mysterious oil pipeline facility in Alaska, up to the first boss fight against \\"a familiar character\\" (sic). The developers published for free level codes that allow users to download those levels. They cautioned against spoiler culture when playing through these levels, as they might potentially ruin some crucial story beats from the yet-to-be-released Dudebro II.  Dudebro II and NeoGAF's MeToo controversy  As a highly controversial MeToo sex scandal rocked NeoGAF in late 2017, the developer issued a public statement disavowing NeoGAF and distancing themselves from the website. They announced plans to purge all references to NeoGAF, and start work under a new team on a spiritual successor. No further statements confirming the game is in active development were ever issued. However, other NeoGAF community works such as the graphical novel \\"Savage Empire\\" survived the transitional fallout from NeoGAF's controversy.

Following pressure by his British ministers, George II of Great Britain, Elector of Hanover, renounced the Convention and the German troops returned to active operations. By spring 1758, under a new commander, the Allied forces had driven the French out of Hanover and pushed them back across the River Rhine. Background Following the outbreak of the first fighting between Britain and France in North America in 1754, the French leadership saw that the limited population, troops and resources available in French Canada meant it would ultimately fall to the British if the war was prolonged, and decided to try and gain an equivalent in Europe to exchange for Canada at the negotiating table. Since 1714 Britain and the Electorate of Hanover had shared a single monarch. George II was ruler of both states ‚Äì and the French believed they could exert pressure on him as King of Great Britain by occupying Hanover. In response Britain initially planned to hire 50,000 Russian troops to defend HanoverDull p.40-41 but later altered the plan by making an alliance with Prussia and forming an Army of Observation composed of Hanoverian, Brunswick and Hessian troops mostly paid for by the British government.Middleton p.11 A number of British officers, such as Jeffrey Amherst and Guy Carleton, were given commands in the force. It was placed under the command of the Duke of Cumberland, second son of George II. The name Army of Observation expressed a hope that the army would serve as a deterrent and their role would merely be to observe. In early 1756, when a French invasion of the British Isles seemed imminent, many of the Hanoverian and Hessian troops were shipped to southern England to boost its defences. As the threat of invasion subsided, the troops were then shipped back to Germany again. The prospect of fighting in Western Germany coincided with a dispute between Austria and Prussia, who went to war in 1756. Following the First Treaty of Versailles, Austria and France formed Franco-Austrian Alliance and sought to defeat the German allies in turn in 1757. First a major French force would sweep through Western Germany defeating and occupying Hanover, and the French would swing to attack Prussia from the west while Austria came from the south. France began building up a large force known as the Army of Westphalia under the Duc d'Estr√©es. Invasion The Weser and the fortresses at Hamelin, Minden, Nienburg and Bremen formed a natural line of defence. In early June 1757, the French army began to advance towards Hanover once it became clear that there was to be no negotiated agreement. The first skirmish between the two forces had taken place on 3 May. Part of the French army was delayed by the Siege of Geldern which took three months to capture from its Prussian garrison of 800. The bulk of the French army advanced across the Rhine, advancing slowly because of the difficulties of logistics for moving an army estimated at around 100,000. In the face of this advance, the smaller German Army of Observation retreated back across the River Weser into the territory of the Electorate of Hanover itself, while Cumberland tried to ready his troops. On July 2,the Prussian port of Emden fell to the French before a Royal Navy squadron sent to relieve it could reach there. This cut Hanover off from the Dutch Republic meaning that supplies from Britain could now only be shipped direct by sea.Dull p.95 The French followed this up by seizing Cassel, securing their right flank.Corbett p.186 Battle of Hastenbeck By late July, Cumberland believed his army was ready for battle and adopted a defensive position around the village of Hastenbeck. The French won a narrow victory over him there, but as Cumberland retreated his force began to disintegrate as morale collapsed.Dull p.96 Despite his victory, d'Estr√©es was shortly afterwards replaced as commander of the French army by the Duc de Richelieu, who had recently distinguished himself leading the French forces that had captured Minorca. Richelieu's orders followed the original strategy of taking total control of Hanover, and then turning west to offer assistance to the Austrians attacking Prussia. Occupation of Hanover Cumberland's forces continued to withdraw northwards. The French pursuit was slowed by further problems with supplies, but they continued to steadily pursue the retreating Army of Observation. In an effort to cause a diversion and provide some relief to Cumberland, the British planned an expedition to raid the French coastal town of Rochefort ‚Äì hoping that the sudden threat would compel the French to withdraw troops from Germany to protect the French coast against further attacks. Under Richelieu the French continued their drive, taking Minden and then capturing the city of Hanover on 11 August.Corbett p.193 The city of Hanover, the capital of the Electorate, was occupied by French forces in August 1757. Richelieu despatched a force to occupy Brunswick. Frederick the Great then decided to withdraw the Prussian contingent of Cumberland's army so they could rejoin his own forces further weakening the Army of Observation. The Hanoverian government retreated with Cumberland via Verden to Stade, Bremen-Verden's capital and a port town connected to the North Sea by the River Elbe. Although it was well-fortified and could be supplied from sea, Cumberland believed their situation to be precarious. The proposal that a large number of British reinforcements be diverted to Stade was rejected, and the British expedition was sent to its original destination of Rochefort,Corbett p.197‚Äì200 although it was launched too late to do anything to provide a diversion in support of Cumberland.Middleton p.44 Orders were sent to Captain Hyde Parker to use his Royal Navy squadron to keep open the supply route down the Elbe to Cumberland until the onset of ice prevented him. The deployment of this squadron left Richelieu to believe that Cumberland's position in Stade was secure, as he could not be defeated through lack of food and supplies. Morale in the French army had now collapsed, and many troops had been immobilised by illness. Richelieu was now open to a negotiated settlement ‚Äì a prospect he had rejected on 21 August when Cumberland had proposed an armistice.Corbett p.198-99 Convention of Klosterzeven Frederick V King of Denmark was obligated by treaty to send troops to defend the Duchies of Bremen and Verden, both ruled in personal union with Britain and Hanover, if they were threatened by a foreign power. As he was eager to preserve his country's neutrality, he attempted to broker an agreement between the two commanders.Mayo p.40 Richelieu, believing his army was in any condition to attack Klosterzeven, was receptive to the proposal as was Cumberland who was not optimistic about his own prospects. On 10 September at Klosterzeven the British and French signed the Convention of Klosterzeven which secured the immediate end of hostilities. The terms called for several conditions. The national contingents from Brunswick and Hesse would return to their homelands. Half the Hanoverian force would be interned at Stade, while the remainder were to withdraw across the River Elbe. Most of Hanover would be under French occupation, except for a demilitarised zone. The French would evacuate the Duchy of Bremen, provided the British withdrew their ships from the River Weser. However, a number of issues were left vague and poorly defined leading to later dispute and controversy.Mayo p.40 Following the convention the Army of Observation began to disperse, though they were not required to surrender their weapons. However some of the Hessians were forcibly disarmed by French troops, in apparent violation of the terms. The Convention was immediately attacked in Britain, and despite having given Cumberland authorisation to negotiate terms George II angrily rebuked his son on his return to London in October, compelling Cumberland to resign all his military offices.Anderson p.212 Richelieu also faced strong criticism from Paris where the terms were perceived as far too lenient.McLynn p.259 He had decided it was too late in the year to now commit his forces to a full attack on Prussia which would have to wait until the following year. Instead he moved his forces to take up winter quarters around Halberstadt. This was in spite of the fact he had instruction to besiege the Prussian fortress of Magdeburg. The British government, seeing the terms agreed at Klosterzeven as contravening their own agreement with Prussia announced that they were not bound by it.Middleton p.37 They also began to lobby George II and his Hanoverian ministers to abandon the convention and re-enter the war. On 8 October George II revoked the agreement because of a technicality concerning the French interference with Hessian forces returning home.Middleton p.38 As the French were themselves dissatisfied by the agreement, they were also prepared to accept a return to hostilities. Directed by the British, the Hanoverians began to reform the Army of Observation and selected Ferdinand of Brunswick, a Prussian commander and brother-in-law of Frederick the Great, as its new commander. The British now agreed to take over the payment of Hanoverian troops as well as other contingents. This marked a sudden reversal in the policies of William Pitt, as he had previously been opposed to further British financial commitments to a continental war. However, he still insisted that no British troops would be sent to join Brunswick's army. Allied counter-attack Ferdinand of Brunswick who in late 1757 took command of the re-formed Army of Observation and pushed the French back across the Rhine, liberating Hanover. Ferdinand immediately began reforms of the forces placed under his command, and he tried to instil a fresh spirit into the Hanoverians. He was helped by the fact that the French troops had committed various acts of brutality that had turned the civilian population against the occupiers.McLynn p.260 Following Frederick the Great's victory over the French at Rossbach,Anderson p.299 Ferdinand launched a winter campaign ‚Äì an unusual strategy at the time ‚Äì against the French occupiers. The condition of the French forces had deteriorated by this point and Richelieu began to withdraw rather than face a major battle. Shortly afterwards he resigned his post and was replaced by Louis, Count of Clermont. Clermont wrote to Louis XV describing the poor conditions of his army, which he claimed was made up of looters and casualties.McLynn p.261 Richelieu was accused of various misdemeanours including stealing the pay of his own soldiers.Dull p.120 Ferdinand's counterattack saw the Allied forces re-capture the port of Emden and drive the French back across the River Rhine so that by the spring Hanover had been liberated. Despite the French having been seemingly close to their goal of total victory in Europe by late 1757 ‚Äì early 1758 began to reveal a shift in the overall fortunes of the war as Britain and its allies began to have more success around the globe.McLynn p.260 Aftermath Despite the setback in 1758, it was still a central part of French strategy to recapture Hanover and use it as a bargaining counter for lost French territories. This particularly became the case following the fall of Quebec in 1759. The French committed increasingly large forces in their attempt to defeat Ferdinand's army and occupy Hanover, but despite repeated efforts they were unable to break through and capture it again. Following the defeat of the final French attempt at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in 1762, an armistice was agreed and the later Treaty of Paris compelled France to evacuate all their forces from Germany and the Austrian Netherlands. In the later American War of Independence France signed a neutrality convention with Hanover, ruling out a French attack on Hanoverian soil. This was a recognition by the French leadership that it had been a mistake to attack Hanover in 1757 and pour so many troops and resources into the attempt to retake it ‚Äì while British forces had been free to attack French colonies in the West Indies, Canada, Africa and India.Simms p.422‚Äì661 References Bibliography * Anderson, Fred.

He is the founder of Toms Shoes and co-founder of Madefor.  Early life and education  Mycoskie was born in Arlington, Texas to Mike Mycoskie, an orthopedic surgeon, and Pam Mycoskie, an author. After first attending Arlington Martin High School, he graduated from St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin in 1995. Mycoskie, who began playing tennis when he was 10, attended Southern Methodist University on a partial tennis scholarship in 1995, and elected a dual major in philosophy and business. After an Achilles tendon injury he sustained as a sophomore, which effectively ended his tennis career, Mycoskie left SMU and launched his first business, EZ Laundry. Originally focused on SMU, which had no on-campus dry cleaning service, EZ Laundry expanded, ultimately employing more than 40 people, servicing three universities, and generating approximately $1 million in sales. Mycoskie sold the company to his partner in 1999.  Career  Following college, Mycoskie moved to Nashville and founded Mycoskie Media, an outdoor billboard company that focused mainly on marketing country music. The company was quickly profitable, and was bought by Clear Channel nine months after its launch. In 2001, Mycoskie and his sister, Paige Mycoskie, applied for the cast of Survivor. A member of the Survivor production team told them about The Amazing Race, which had yet to debut, and they instead pursued a team position on that show. They competed in the second season of The Amazing Race and finished in third place, missing a million dollar prize by four minutes. Mycoskie moved to Los Angeles later that year. In Los Angeles, Mycoskie co-founded the cable network Reality Central with Larry Namer, a founder of E! Entertainment Television. Raising $25 million from venture capitalists, along with other members of reality show casts, the network launched in 2003 with a plan of airing original content and re-runs of reality programming. Although the network had moderate success, it folded in 2005 after Rupert Murdoch launched the Fox Reality Channel and outbid Reality Central for advertisers and programming. Determined to pursue an entrepreneurial path, Mycoskie then partnered with the founders of TrafficSchool.com to create DriversEd Direct, an online driver's education service which additionally offered behind-the-wheel training in hybrid and sport utility vehicles. To promote DriversEdDirect, he created Closer Marketing Group, a Santa Monica-based marketing firm specializing in brand development and viral marketing. Mycoskie visited Argentina on vacation in 2006. While there, he met an American woman who was part of a volunteer organization that provided shoes for children in need. Mycoskie spent several days traveling from village to village with the group, as well as on his own. \\"(I witnessed) the intense pockets of poverty just outside the bustling capital,\\" he wrote in a 2011 article for The Business Insider. \\"It dramatically heightened my awareness. Yes, I knew somewhere in the back of my mind that poor children around the world often went barefoot, but now, for the first time, I saw the real effects of being shoeless: the blisters, the sores, the infections.\\" Inspired, Mycoskie returned to the United States and founded Shoes for Better Tomorrows. Designed as a for-profit business that could continually give new shoes to disadvantaged children, he created the \\"One for One\\" business model: the company would donate a new pair of shoes for every pair of shoes sold. An early example of social entrepreneurship, the shoes, similar to the Argentinian Alpargata, were created to appeal to a worldwide audience, which would both sustain the company's mission and generate profit. Shoes For A Better Tomorrow, later shortened to TOMS, was started in 2006; by 2013, the company had donated more than 10,000,000 pairs of shoes to people in need. The shoes are sold globally in more than 1000 stores. In 2011, Toms expanded to include eyeglasses in its \\"One for One\\" offering‚Äîfor every pair of sunglasses purchased, sight-saving medical treatment, prescription glasses, or surgery is donated to a person in need. While Mycoskie conceived the idea, a \\"Sight Giving Partner,\\" the Seva Foundation, was contracted to administer the actual program, which launched in Nepal, Tibet, and Cambodia. In a 2012 interview with Fast Company, Mycoskie said it was helpful for him to work with Seva. \\"I've been there when (people have had) surgery... and I've handed out the glasses. But as Toms grows, it has to be less about 'What's Blake's most intimate, joyful experience?' and more about 'What's the great need?'\\" Mycoskie published the book Start Something That Matters in 2011. In it, he wrote about the virtues of social entrepreneurship and the concept of businesses using their profits and company assets to make charitable donations or engage in other charitable efforts, using his experience with Toms to demonstrate both the intangible and real returns. For every copy of Start Something That Matters sold, Mycoskie promised to give a children's book to a child in need. Fifty percent of royalties from the book were then used to provide grants to up-and-coming entrepreneurs, and Mycoskie increased this to 100% in late 2012. The book became a New York Times best-selling business book, and a number one New York Times best-seller in the advice category. At SXSW in 2014, Mycoskie announced the launch of TOMS Roasting Co., a company which offers coffee sourced through direct trade efforts in Rwanda, Honduras, Peru, Guatemala, and Malawi. TOMS Roasting Co. will donate a week of water to people in need in supplier countries for every bag of coffee sold. In 2014, Mycoskie announced that TOMS would launch an additional \\"One for One\\" product every year. In August 2014, Mycoskie sold 50% of Toms to Bain Capital, retaining his role as Chief Shoe Giver. In a company press release, he said: \\"In eight short years, we've had incredible success, and now we need a strategic partner who shares our bold vision for the future and can help us realize it.\\" He will donate 50% of the profits from the sale to establish a fund that identifies and supports social entrepreneurship and other causes. Bain committed to matching Mycoskie's donation to the fund, and will continue the One For One business model. Mycoskie, with Pat Dossett, launched a wellness program called Madefor in March 2020. It is a subscription-based program that helps users adopt sustainable habits of body and mind; and develops lifestyle changes through practice-oriented monthly kit service. The kits are based on different scientific topics, and contain the literature along with a physical tool to monitor progress of the users' shift in behavior and mindset.  Personal life  Mycoskie lives in Jackson, Wyoming. He mutually separated with his ex-wife, Heather Lang in 2020. They have one son, Summit, and one daughter, Charlie. Mycoskie also acts as a parent to Wubetu Shimelash, a young boy from Ethiopia. He has been Shimelash‚Äôs financial benefactor, supporting his education. Mycoskie is an avid golfer, fly fisher, surfer and adventure athlete, who enjoys rock climbing and polo. He is an investor at Urban Golf Performance, and Athletic Brewing Company; and was a participant of the Sexiest Bachelor in America Pageant.

Such projects often involve information searching or information retrieval (IR), information gathering, and information sharing. Beyond that, CIS can extend to collaborative information synthesis and collaborative sense-making. Background Seeking for information is often considered a solo activity, but there are many situations that call for people working together for information seeking. Such situations are typically complex in nature, and involve working through several sessions exploring, evaluating, and gathering relevant information. Take for example, a couple going on a trip. They have the same goal, and in order to accomplish their goal, they need to seek out several kinds of information, including flights, hotels, and sightseeing. This may involve them working together over multiple sessions, exploring and collecting useful information, and collectively making decisions that help them move toward their common goal. It is a common knowledge that collaboration is either necessary or highly desired in many activities that are complex or difficult to deal with for an individual. Despite its natural appeal and situational necessity, collaboration in information seeking is an understudied domain. The nature of the available information and its role in our lives have changed significantly, but the methods and tools that are used to access and share that information in collaboration have remained largely unaltered. People still use general-purpose systems such as email and IM for doing CIS projects, and there is a lack of specialized tools and techniques to support CIS explicitly. There are also several models to explain information seeking and information behavior,Reddy, M. and Jansen, B. J. (2007) A model for understanding collaborative information behavior in context: A study of two healthcare teams, Information Processing & Management. 44 (1), 256-273. but the areas of collaborative information seeking and collaborative information behavior remain understudied.

On the practical side, a few specialized systems for supporting CIS have emerged in the recent past, but their usage and evaluations have underwhelmed. Despite such limitations, the field of CIS has been getting a lot of attention lately, and several promising theories and tools have come forth. Multiple reviews of CIS related literature are written by Shah.Shah, C (2010). Collaborative Information Seeking: A Literature Review, in Anne Woodsworth (ed.)

(226 pages) Theories Depending upon what one includes or excludes while talking about CIS, we have many or hardly any theories. If we consider the past work on the groupware systems, many interesting insights can be obtained about people working on collaborative projects, the issues they face, and the guidelines for system designers. One of the notable works is by Grudin, who laid out eight design principles for developers of groupware systems. The discussion below is primarily based on some of the recent works in the field of computer supported cooperative work CSCW, collaborative IR, and CIS. Definitions and terminology The literature is filled with works that use terms such as collaborative information retrieval,Fidel, R., Bruce, H., Pejtersen, A. M., Dumais, S. T., Grudin, J., and Poltrock, S. (2000a). Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR). The New Review of Information Behaviour Research, pages 235‚Äì247. social searching,Evans, B. M. and Chi, E. H.

In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA. which are often used interchangeably. There are several definitions of such related or similar terms in the literature. For instance, FosterFoster, J. (2006). Collaborative information seeking and retrieval. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST), 40:329‚Äì356. defined collaborative IR as \\"the study of the systems and practices that enable individuals to collaborate during the seeking, searching, and retrieval of information.\\" ShahShah, C. (2009). Lessons and challenges for Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS) systems developers. In Proceedings of GROUP 2009 Workshop on Collaborative Information Behavior, Sanibel Island, Florida. defined CIS as a process of collaboratively seeking information that is \\"defined explicitly among the participants, interactive, and mutually beneficial.\\" While there is still a lack of a definition or a terminology that is universally accepted, but most agree that CIS is an active process, as opposed to collaborative filtering, where a system connects the users based on their passive involvement (e.g., buying similar products on Amazon). Models of collaboration Foley and Smeaton defined two key aspects of collaborative information seeking as division of labor and the sharing of knowledge. Division of labor allows collaborating searchers to tackle larger problems by reducing the duplication of effort (e.g., finding documents that one's collaborator has already discovered). The sharing of knowledge allows searchers to influence each other's activities as they interact with the retrieval system in pursuit of their (often evolving) information need. This influence can occur in real time if the collaborative search system supports it, or it can occur in a turn-taking, asynchronous manner if that is how interaction is structured. Teevan et al.Jaime Teevan, Meredith Ringel Morris, and Steve Bush. 2009. Discovering and using groups to improve personalized search. In Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM '09), Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Paolo Boldi, Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, and B. Barla Cambazoglu (Eds.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 15-24. DOI=10.1145/1498759.1498786 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1498759.1498786 characterized two classes of collaboration, task-based vs. trait-based. Task- based collaboration corresponds to intentional collaboration; trait-based collaboration facilitates the sharing of knowledge through inferred similarity of information need. Situations, motivations, and methods One of the important issues to study in CIS is the instance, reason, and the methods behind a collaboration. For instance, Morris,Morris, M. R. (2008). A survey of collaborative web search practices. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 1657‚Äì1660, Florence, Italy. using a survey with 204 knowledge workers at a large technology company found that people often like and want to collaborate, but they do not find specialized tools to help them in such endeavors. Some of the situations for doing collaborative information seeking in this survey were travel planning, shopping, and literature search. Shah,Shah, C (2010). Working in Collaboration - What, Why, and How? Proceedings of Collaborative Information Retrieval workshop at CSCW 2010. Savannah, GA: February 7, 2010. similarly, using personal interviews, identified three main reasons why people collaborate. #Requirement/setup. Sometimes a group of people are \\"forced\\" to collaborate. Example includes a merger between two companies. #Division of labor. Working together may help the participants to distribute the workload. Example includes a group of students working on a class project. #Diversity of skills. Often people get together because they could not individually possess the required set of skills. Example includes co-authorship, where different authors bring different set of skills to the table. As far as the tools and/or methods for CIS are concerned, both Morris and Shah found that email is still the most used tool. Other popular methods are face-to-face meetings, IM, and phone or conference calls. In general, the choice of the method or tool for our respondents depended on their situation (co-located or remote), and objective (brainstorming or working on independent parts). Space-time organization of CIS systems and methods The classical way of organizing collaborative activities is based on two factors: location and time. Recently Hansen & Jarvelin and Golovchinsky, Pickens, & BackGolovchinsky, G., Pickens, J., and Back, M. (2008b). A taxonomy of collaboration in online information seeking. In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA. also classified approaches to collaborative IR using these two dimensions of space and time. See \\"Browsing is a Collaborative Process\\", where the authors depict various library activities on these two dimensions.Twidale, M. B. and Nichols, D. M. (1996). Collaborative browsing and visualisation of the search process. In Proceedings of Aslib, volume 48, pages 177‚Äì182. As we can see from this figure, the majority of collaborative activities in conventional libraries are co-located and synchronous, whereas collaborative activities relating to digital libraries are more remote and synchronous. Social information filtering, or collaborative filtering, as we saw earlier, is a process benefitting from other users' actions in the past; thus, it falls under asynchronous and mostly remote domain. These days email also serves as a tool for doing asynchronous collaboration among users who are not co-located. Chat or IM (represented as 'internet' in the figure) helps to carry out synchronous and remote collaboration. Rodden, similarly, presented a classification of CSCW systems using the form of interaction and the geographical nature of cooperative systems. Further, Rodden & BlairRodden, T. and Blair, G. (1991). CSCW and distributed systems: the problem of control. In Proceedings of ECSCW, pages 49‚Äì64, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. presented an important characteristic to all CSCW systems ‚Äì control. According to the authors, two predominant control mechanisms have emerged within CSCW systems: speech act theory systems, and procedure based systems. These mechanisms are tightly coupled with the kind of control the system can support in a collaborative environment (discussed later). Often researchers also talk about other dimensions, such as intentionality and depth of mediation (system mediated or user mediated), while classifying various CIS systems. Control, communication, and awareness Three components specific to group-work or collaboration that are highly predominant in the CIS or CSCW literature are control, communication, and awareness. In this section key definitions and related works for these components will be highlighted. Understanding their roles can also help us address various design issues with CIS systems. Control Rodden identified the value of control in CSCW systems and listed a number of projects with their corresponding schemes for implementing for control. For instance, the COSMOS projectWilbur, S. B. and Young, R. E. (1988). The COSMOS project: a multi-disciplinary approach to the design of computer-supported group working. In Speth, R., editor, EUTECO 88: Research into Networks and Distributed Applications, Vienna, Austria. had a formal structure to represent control in the system. They used roles to represent people or automatons, and rules to represent the flow and processes. The roles of the people could be a supervisor, processor, or analyst. Rules could be a condition that a process needs to satisfy in order to start or finish. Due to such a structure seen in projects like COSMOS, Rodden classified these control systems as procedural based systems. The control penal was every effort to seeking people and control others in this method used for highly responsible people take control of another network system was supply chine managements or transformation into out connection processor information Communication This is one of the most critical components of any collaboration. In fact, Rodden (1991) identified message or communication systems as the class of systems in CSCW that is most mature and most widely used. Since the focus here is on CIS systems that allow its participants to engage in an intentional and interactive collaboration, there must be a way for the participants to communicate with each other. What is interesting to note is that often, collaboration could begin by letting a group of users communicate with each other. For instance, Donath & RobertsonDonath, J. S. and Robertson, N. (1994). The sociable web. In Proceedings of WWW Conference, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. presented a system that allows a user to know that others were currently viewing the same webpage and communicate with those people to initiate a possible collaboration or at least a co-browsing experience. Providing communication capabilities even in an environment that was not originally designed for carrying out collaboration is an interesting way of encouraging collaboration. Awareness Awareness, in the context of CSCW, has been defined as \\"an understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity\\".Dourish, P. and Bellotti, V. (1992). Awareness and coordination in shared workspaces. In Proceedings of ACM CSCW, pages 107‚Äì114, Toronto, Ontario. The following four kinds of awareness are often discussed and addressed in the CSCW literature: #Group awareness. This kind of awareness includes providing information to each group member about the status and activities of the other collaborators at a given time. #Workspace awareness. This refers to a common workspace that the group has where they can bring and discuss their findings, and create a common product. #Contextual awareness. This type of awareness relates to the application domain, rather than the users. Here, we want to identify what content is useful for the group, and what the goals are for the current project. #Peripheral awareness. This relates to the kind of information that has resulted from personal and the group's collective history, and should be kept separate from what a participant is currently viewing or doing. Shah and MarchioniniShah, C., & Marchionini, G. (2010). Awareness in Collaborative Information Seeking. Journal of American Society of Information Science and Technology (JASIST), 61(10), 1970-1986. studied awareness as provided by interface in collaborative information seeking. They found that one needs to provide \\"right\\" (not too little, not too much, and appropriate for the task at hand) kind of awareness to reduce the cost of coordination and maximize the benefits of collaboration. Systems A number of specialized systems have been developed back from the days of the groupware systems to today's Web 2.0 interfaces. A few such examples, in chronological order, are given below. Ariadne Twidale et al.Twidale, M. B., Nichols, D. M., and Paice, C. D. (1995). Supporting collaborative learning during information searching. In Proceedings of Computer Supported Col- laborative Learning (CSCL), pages 367‚Äì374, Bloomington, Indiana. developed Ariadne to support the collaborative learning of database browsing skills. In addition to enhancing the opportunities and effectiveness of the collaborative learning that already occurred, Ariadne was designed to provide the facilities that would allow collaborations to persist as people increasingly searched information remotely and had less opportunity for spontaneous face-to-face collaboration. Ariadne was developed in the days when Telnet-based access to library catalogs was a common practice. Building on top of this command-line interface, Ariadne could capture the users‚Äô input and the database‚Äôs output, and form them into a search history that consisted of a series of command-output pairs. Such a separation of capture and display allowed Ariadne to work with various forms of data capture methods. To support complex browsing processes in collaboration, Ariadne presented a visualization of the search process. This visualization consisted of thumbnails of screens, looking like playing cards, which represented command-output pairs. Any such card can be expanded to reveal its details. The horizontal axis on Ariadne‚Äôs display represented time, and the vertical axis showed information on the semantics of the action it represented: the top row for the top level menus, the middle row for specifying a search, and the bottom row for looking at particular book details. This visualization of the search process in Ariadne makes it possible to annotate, discuss with colleagues around the screen, and distribute to remote collaborators for asynchronous commenting easily and effectively. As we saw in the previous section, having access to one‚Äôs history as well as the history of one‚Äôs collaborators are very crucial to effective collaboration. Ariadne implements these requirements with the features that let one visualize, save, and share a search process. In fact, the authors found one of the advantages of search visualization was the ability to recap previous searching sessions easily in a multi-session exploratory searching. SearchTogether More recently, one of the collaborative information seeking tools that have caught a lot of attention is SearchTogether, developed by Morris and Horvitz.Morris, M. R. and Horvitz, E. (2007). SearchTogether: An Interface for Collaborative Web Search. In ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), pages 3‚Äì12, Newport, RI. The design of this tool was motivated by a survey that the researchers did with 204 knowledge workers, in which they discovered the following. * A majority of respondents wanted to collaborate while searching on the Web. * The most common ways of collaborating in information seeking tasks are sending emails back and forth, using IM to exchange links and query terms, and using phone calls while looking at a Web browser. * Some of the most popular Web searching tasks on which people like to collaborate are planning travels or social events, making expensive purchases, researching medical conditions, and looking for information related to a common project. Based on the survey responses, and the current and desired practices for collaborative search, the authors of SearchTogether identified three key features for supporting people‚Äôs collaborative information behavior while searching on the Web: awareness, division of labor, and persistence. Let us look at how these three features are implemented. SearchTogether instantiates awareness in several ways, one of which is per-user query histories. This is done by showing each group member‚Äôs screen name, his/her photo and queries in the ‚ÄúQuery Awareness‚Äù region. The access to the query histories is immediate and interactive, as clicking on a query brings back the results of that query from when it was executed. The authors identified query awareness as a very important feature in collaborative searching, which allows group members to not only share their query terms, but also learn better query formulation techniques from one another. Another component of SearchTogether that facilitates awareness is the display of page-specific metadata. This region includes several pieces of information about the displayed page, including group members who viewed the given page, and their comments and ratings. The authors claim that such visitation information can help one either choose to avoid a page already visited by someone in the group to reduce the duplication of efforts, or perhaps choose to visit such pages, as they provide a sign of promising leads as indicated by the presence of comments and/or ratings. Division of labor in SearchTogether is implemented in three ways: (1) ‚ÄúSplit Search‚Äù allows one to split the search results among all online group members in a round-robin fashion, (2) ‚ÄúMulti-Engine Search‚Äù takes a query and runs it on n different search engines, where n is the number of online group members, (3) manual division of labor can be facilitated using integrated IM. Finally, the persistence feature in SearchTogether is instantiated by storing all the objects and actions, including IM conversations, query histories, recommendation queues, and page-specific metadata. Such data about all the group members are available to each member when he/she logs in. This allows one to easily carry a multi-session collaborative project.

CerchiamoL a collaborative exploratory search tool. Demo presented at the 2008 ACM conference on computer supported cooperative work (CSCW 2008), San Diego, CA, November 08‚Äì12, 2008 is a collaborative information seeking tool that explores issues related to algorithmic mediation of information seeking activities and how collaborators' roles can be used to structure the user interface. Cerchiamo introduced the notion of algorithmic mediation, that is, the ability of the system to collect input asynchronously from multiple collaborating searchers, and to use these multiple streams of input to affect the information that is being retrieved and displayed to the searchers. Cerchiamo collected judgments of relevance from multiple collaborating searchers and used those judgments to create a ranked list of items that were potentially relevant to the information need. This algorithm prioritized items that were retrieved by multiple queries and that were retrieved by queries that also retrieved many other relevant documents. This rank fusion is just one way in which a search system that manages activities of multiple collaborating searchers can combine their inputs to generate results that are better than those produced by individuals working independently. Cerchiamo implemented two roles--Prospector and Miner--that searchers could assume. Each role had an associated interface. The Prospector role/interface focused on running many queries and making a few judgments of relevance for each query to explore the information space. The Miner role/interface focused on making relevance judgments on a ranked list of items selected from items retrieved by all queries in the current session. This combination of roles allowed searchers to explore and exploit the information space, and led teams to discover more unique relevant documents than pairs of individuals working separately. Coagmento Coagmento (Latin for \\"working together\\") is a new and unique system that allows a group of people work together for their information seeking tasks without leaving their browsers. Coagmento has been developed with a client-server architecture, where the client is implemented as a Firefox plug-in that helps multiple people working in collaboration to communicate, and search, share and organize information. The server component stores and provides all the objects and actions collected from the client. Due to this decoupling, Coagmento provides a flexible architecture that allows its users to be co-located or remote, working synchronously or asynchronously, and use different platforms. Coagmento includes a toolbar and a sidebar. The toolbar has several buttons that helps one collect information and be aware of the progress in a given collaboration. The toolbar has three major parts: * Buttons for collecting information and making annotations. These buttons help one save or remove a webpage, make annotations on a webpage, and highlight and collect text snippets. * Page-specific statistics. The middle portion of the toolbar shows various statistics, such as the number of views, annotations, and snippets, for the displayed page. A user can click on a given statistic and obtain more information. For instance, clicking on the number of snippets will bring up a window that shows all the snippets collected by the collaborators from the displayed page. * Project-specific statistics. The last portion of the toolbar displays task/project name and various statistics, including number of pages visited and saved, about the current project. Clicking on that portion brings up the workspace where one can view all the collected objects (pages and snippets) brought in by the collaborators for that project. The sidebar features a chat window, under which there are three tabs with the history of search engine queries, saved pages and snippets. With each of these objects, the user who created or collected that object is shown. Anyone in the group can access an object by clicking on it. For instance, one can click on a query issued by anyone in the group to re-run that query and bring up the results in the main browser window. An Android (operating system) app for Coagmento can be found in the Android Market. Cosme Fernandez- Luna et al.Fernandez-Luna, J. M., Huete, J. F., Perez-Vazquez, R., Rodriguez- Cano, J. C., and Shah, C. (2010). COSME: A NetBeans IDE plug-in as a team- centric alternative for search driven software development. In Proceedings of GROUP 2010 Workshop on Collaborative Information Seeking, Sanibel Island, Florida, USA. introduce Cosme (COde Search MEeting) as a NetBeans IDE plug-in that enables remote team of software developers to collaborate in real time during source-code search sessions. The COSME design was motivated by early studies of C. Foley, M. R. Morris, C. Shah, among others researchers, and by habits of software developers identified in a survey of 117 universities students and professors related with projects of software development, as well as to computer programmers of some companies. The five more commons collaborative search habits (or related to it) of the interviewees was: * Revision of problems by the team in the workstation of one of them. * Suggest addresses of Web pages that they have already visited previously, digital books stored in some FTP, or source files of a version control system. * Send emails with algorithms or explanatory text. * Division of search tasks among each member of the team for sharing the final result. * Store relevant information in individual workstation. COSME is designed to enable either synchronous or asynchronous, but explicit remote collaboration among team developers with shared technical information needs. Its client user interface include a search panel that lets developers to specify queries, division of labor principle (possible combination include the use of different search engines, ranking fusion, and split algorithms), searching field (comments, source-code, class or methods declaration), and the collection type (source- code files or digital documentation). The sessions panel wraps the principal options to management the collaborative search sessions, which consists in a team of developers working together to satisfy their shared technical information needs. For example, a developer can use the embedded chat room to negotiate the creation of a collaborative search session, and show comments of the current and historical search results. The implementation of Cosme was based on CIRLab (Collaborative Information Retrieval Laboratory) instantiation, a groupware framework for CIS research and experimentation, Java as programming language, NetBeans IDE Platform as plug-in base, and Amenities (A MEthodology for aNalysis and desIgn of cooperaTIve systEmS) as software engineering methodology. Open-source application frameworks and toolkits CIS systems development is a complex task, which involves software technologies and Know-how in different areas such as distributed programming, information search and retrieval, collaboration among people, task coordination and many others according to the context. This situation is not ideal because it requires great programming efforts. Fortunately, some CIS application frameworks and toolkits are increasing their popularity since they have a high reusability impact for both developers and researchers, like Coagmento Collaboratory and DrakkarKeel. Future research directions Many interesting and important questions remain to be addressed in the field of CIS, including # Why do people collaborate? Identifying their motivations can help us design better support for their specific needs. # What additional tools are required to enhance existing methods of collaboration, given a specific domain? # How to evaluate various aspects of collaborative information seeking, including system and user performance? # How to measure the costs and benefits of collaboration? # What are the information seeking situations in which collaboration is beneficial? When does it not pay off? # How can we measure the performance of a collaborative group? # How can we measure the contribution of an individual in a collaborative group? # What sorts of retrieval algorithms can be used to combine input from multiple searchers? # What kinds of algorithmic mediation can improve team performance?

He is known as the \\"founding father\\" of the One Thousand and One Nights dynasty of the film industry due to his creation of the 'Scheherazade' trilogy. He is also known by his formal name Takhir Mukhtorovich Sabirov. His mother Mastona Sobir Zoda was the daughter of Duke Sobir-kaloni Tura-zoda of Samarkand (now part of the Samarqand Province, Uzbekistan), from the Duchy of Greater Khorasan, known as Tura-zoda, who were eminent members of Central Asia's Aristocracy. Takhir was the youngest of five children. He was married twice and has two sons and three daughters. He completed the Performing Arts discipline at the Tashkent State Art Institute of Theatrical Arts in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In 1951, he then continued further by obtaining his Directorial discipline under faculty of Yuri Zavadsky at The Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (GITIS) in Moscow, Russia. His first film, \\"Roh\\" (1955) (Russian title: –î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∞) produced by Mosfilm initiated him into the film industry, but the role of Yodgor in \\"Dokhunda\\" (1956) sparked his career and was followed by several successful roles. His directorial debut was in \\"Vaqti zangirii pisar rasid\\" (Russian title: \\"Sinu para jinitsa\\", 1959), which was the first comedy musical motion picture in the Cinema of Tajikistan. With his films he introduced the Tajik film industry onto international scenebasis with his nomination in International film festivals. His film \\"Margi Sudkhur\\" (Russian title: \\"Smert' Rostovshika\\", 1966) was nominated at the International Film Festival of Asia and Africa in 1968. His trilogy of \\"New Tales of Scheherazade\\", \\"Another Night of Scheherazade\\" and The Last Night of Scheherazade that were based on the Arabic folktale One Thousand and One Nights had made a great impact in the Cinema of Tajikistan by opening it to European audiences and borders. The Scheherazade trilogies were among the first Tajik film productions that achieved distribution beyond Russian (former USSR) borders, placing Tajik film on the map of International Film Festivals. Not only has he directed and co- written the Scheherazade trilogies, but also starred as King Shahryar (Sultan); which coincidentally is more true to his own lineage of royalty. He became a cultural icon gaining more acknowledgement and respect. Regardless of the obstacles he had faced in his lifetime, he never stopped filming. He is known in the Tajik film industry as one of the major film directors of his time. He broadened his entertainment field as he established entrepreneurial joint venture \\"Movarounnahr Joint Venture\\" as an Art Director. Although he was involved in many fields of the film industry, he always had time to instruct and inspire students and apprentices. In 1999, he was part of the judging committee in the 21st (XXI) Moscow International Film Festival. He became the first Tajik film director to be honored with the position of a film judge. In 2002, he was an honorary guest at the 55th (LV) Cannes Film Festival. Even in his seventy years of age he was involved in film production. However, on May 30, 2002 he died with his film \\"Khoja Kamoli Khujandi\\" still in production. In 2003, a street, \\"Takhir Sabirov Street\\" was named after his death for his contributions in the Cinema of Tajikistan (Tajikfilm, Tajik Film Studio).

The reserve is one of a few small nature reserves including the Andrew Johnston Big Scrub, Hayters Hill, Davis Scrub, Boatharbour and Wilsons Peak flora and nature reserves that conserve rainforests typical of the once extensive Big Scrub. The Big Scrub comprised of lowland subtropical rainforest which was largely cleared for agriculture in the late 19th century. Victoria Park is a popular area for picnics and barbecues. There is wheelchair access, a wooden boardwalk, pit toilets, tables, gas barbecues and information boards. In this small area, a large diversity of flora exists. 82 tree species are included amongst the 152 plant species.Victoria Park Nature Reserve - pamphlet NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service 1998 Many types of vines, smaller plants and fungi grow here. Most of the animals are nocturnal, though red-legged pademelons are sometimes seen on the edges of the grassy area. Rainforest pigeons such as the wompoo fruit dove are often heard, but rarely seen. Land mullets may be heard crawling on the rainforest floor. Significant rainforest tree species include Moreton Bay fig, strangler fig, long jack, black bean, white booyong, red bean and bumpy ash. Other notable species include white bean, macadamia, yellow kamala and the rare Baloghia marmorata. A tourist attraction in the early 20th century was a giant Moreton Bay fig, around tall. Allegedly sighted by Captain Cook from HMS Endeavour in 1770. The tree was damaged by a storm in 1970 and died soon afterwards. Re-vegetation of the previously cleared farmland is under progress. However, the removal of original jungle vegetation has caused a lack of soil nutrients. Despite this, wildlife corridors are slowly being created to link other nearby rainforest remnants.

Accessed 14 January 2010 but died out after the first decade of the twentieth century. They developed as a result of the enthusiasm for painting en plein air fostered by the Barbizon and Impressionist movements in France in the second half of the 19th century, and were modelled on the artists' colonies which grew up in France and parts of the British Isles. In them, free-spirited young men gathered to live cheaply together in the open air, trying to capture the beauty of their surroundings in paintings and drawings. Financial stringency during the depression of the 1890s made life in the camps even more attractive for Australian artists trying to establish themselves in a difficult market. Balmoral The camp at Balmoral c. 1890. Women were not residents but did visit frequently. Some of the earliest camps, established before the spread of suburbia, were at Balmoral Beach. One centred on the weekender built by Bulletin cartoonist Livingston Hopkins \\"Hop\\" on land he leased near Edwards Beach, in north Balmoral. Among the artists who joined Hop at the camp was Julian Ashton, who, while teaching more formally at his school in the city, also encouraged his students to paint out-of-doors. A.J. Daplyn, another keen promoter of the new style of landscape painting, also stayed at the camp, as did many of the artists working for the Picturesque Atlas of Australasia (1886‚Äì89), including Albert Henry Fullwood, Frank P. Mahony, John Mather and Frederic Schell. According to the custom of the time, women did not live in the camps. They were frequent visitors, however, and many women became enthusiastic landscape painters. Other notable visitors were writers Robert Louis Stevenson, who spent a night at Balmoral under canvas, and Ada Cambridge, who included lyrical descriptions of the camp in her 1891 novel A Marked Man and later, in her Thirty Years in Australia (1903). As she noted: > ‚Ä¶ a cluster of tents, a little garden, a woodstock, a water tub ‚Äì almost > hidden in the trees and bushes until one was close upon it; and the camp > looked out upon the great gateway of the heads, and saw all the ships that > passed through, voyaging to the distant world and back again.Ada Cambridge, > A Marked Man, Heinemann, London, 1891, p 163 Curlew Camp Equally well known was Curlew Camp, on the eastern shore of Little Sirius Cove, below today's Taronga Zoo. This had been set up by the Oxford Street businessman Reuben Brasch and his family, who came to stay at the camp by boat, crossing the harbour from Parsley Bay. The Melbourne painters Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton moved to Sydney in the early 1890s, looking for wider opportunities to sell their work. Both spent considerable periods at Curlew and the paintings they did at this time, of Sydney Harbour, Mosman Bay and nearby Cremorne Point, are among the masterpieces of Australian art. Curlew was a well established camp, with many home comforts, including a billiards tent. Residents combined to pay a cook, and there was a youth to take care of odd jobs. Arthur Streeton described life there in evocative letters. His friend the composer Marshall Hall, visiting from Melbourne, was inspired by the harbour setting to write his \\"Hymn to Sydney\\", which began: > City of laughing loveliness! Sun-girdled Queen! > Crowned with imperial morning, bejewelled with joy...Leigh Astbury, > Sunlight and Shadow; Australian Impressionist Painting, 1880-1900, Bay > Books, Sydney, 1989, quoted p108 The art patron Howard Hinton, a frequent visitor, came to know Roberts, Streeton and other painters at the camp. Some of the works he bought from them were donated to the Art Gallery of New South Wales and many became part of the Hinton collection at the Armidale Teachers' College. They can now be seen at the New England Regional Art Museum. Bohemians in the Bush \\"Curlew 1890\\", engraved into the rock. Evidence of the camps can still be seen today In 1991 the Art Gallery of New South Wales presented an exhibition, \\"Bohemians in the Bush\\", in celebration of the artists' camps, bringing together an impressive collection of works from the period.Albie Thoms, Bohemians in the Bush, The Artists' Camps of Mosman, Art Gallery of NSW, 1991, (Exhibition Catalogue) The exhibition also aimed to recreate the social context in which the artists lived, and something of the atmosphere of the busy city where many of them earned their livings as teachers and illustrators. At the time of the \\"Bohemians in the Bush\\" exhibition, the site of Curlew Camp was accessible only by water or bush track, and had reverted more or less to its natural condition. In order to ensure the preservation of this area, described as \\"one of the sacred sites of Australian painting\\", Mosman Council in 2005 commissioned a heritage study which recommended the creation of a Curlew Camp Artists' Walk, following the route taken from the Mosman ferry. It also recommended improved access to the camp site itself, construction of a viewing platform and interpretative signage. Work began on this project in 2007.

This article deals with marine art as a specialized genre practised by artists who did little or nothing else, and does not cover the marine works of the leading painters of the period, such as, and above all, J.M.W. Turner. The tradition of British marine art as a specialized genre with a strong emphasis on the shipping depicted began in large part with the artists Willem Van de Velde the Elder and his son, called the Younger in the early 18th century.Foreword, 1, Brook-Hart. The Van Veldes, originally from Holland, moved to England to work for King Charles II).Brewington, Preface. By the 17th century, marine art was commissioned mostly by merchant seamen and naval officers and created by marine art specialists (rather than artists in general). In part, marine art served as a visual portrayal of Britain's power on the sea and as a way of historically documenting battles and the like.Tracy 3, 5. As British sea captains began to recognize the ability of marine artists to bring Britain's success on the sea to the public on land, some took on an active role in supporting this type of artwork. For example, marine artist Robert Cleveley was hired by Captain William Locker to work in as a clerk, and Captain Locker, interested in employing artists, is believed to have played a significant role in encouraging Cleveley to work as a marine painter.Tracy, 72. Captains would act as marine artists' patrons, commissioning them to paint portraits of themselves and pictures depicting important battles. A few significant marine artists who were supported in this way by naval officers are (among others) Nicholas Pocock, Thomas Luny, and George Chambers.Tracy, 5. William Hodges, for example, who was trained to draw at William Shipley's Academy (studying under Richard Wilson), was hired by the Admiralty to finish his pictures from Cook's 1772 voyage for publication upon reaching home in 1775.Tracy, 225. Captains also commissioned artists to paint portraits of their ships. Dutch Influence and the Beginning of the British Marine Art Tradition The tradition of marine painting really began in Holland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, perhaps because of the significance of seafaring in establishing and maintaining the Dutch Republic.Dewitt, 4. Marine painting began in keeping with medieval Christian art tradition, and so the original paintings portrayed the sea only from a bird‚Äôs eye view, and everything, even the waves, were organized and symmetrical. The viewpoint, symmetry, and overall order of these early paintings were to keep in mind the organization of the heavenly cosmos from which the earth was viewed.Dewitt, 2. Later Dutch artists like Hendrick Vroom and Cornelius Claesz, however, developed new methods for painting, often from a horizontal point of view, with a lower horizon and more focus on realism than symmetry.Dewitt, 4. Most notable of the Dutch artists‚Äô who influenced the British marine art tradition were Willem van de Velde the Elder, and his son, the Younger.Cordingly, 15. Willem van de Velde the Younger was especially admired and thus influential in England because he lived and worked there for thirty-five years.Cordingly, 65. The methods developed by the Dutch to successfully depict some of the sea‚Äôs more elusive features (light and shadow, or the reflection of the sky over the ocean‚Äôs uneven surface, for example) were adopted by British artists as they founded their own marine art tradition. Knowledge of Dutch methods of marine painting was considered so fundamental to a successful marine painting education that it was likened to ‚Äúgrammar school‚Äù for the British marine artist.Cordingly, 16. In fact, it is not uncommon to find Dutch ships painted into the works of British marine artists as a tribute to the Dutch artists from whom they gained so much knowledge and inspiration.Cordingly, 65. The Romantic Era In the Romantic era, interest in marine art expanded from its initial exclusive audience of sailors and naval officers to the general public.Cordingly, 96. One reason for this increased interest may be the significance of the navy in Romantic British culture. With the increase of industry in Britain and the threatening resurgence of the French royal navy during the time after the Peace of Utrecht, England found means and motivation to improve its sea power on both the level of mercantilism and conquest.Marcus, 245. Later into the Romantic era the Napoleonic Wars, which were fought in large part on the sea, brought the British navy further to the forefront when the British navy played a significant role in defeated the French forces.Callender, 184. The infamous Glorious First of June which marks a major British naval victory over the French during the French Revolutionary Wars, happened within the Romantic era (June 1, 1794) as did the Battle of Trafalgar of the Napoleonic Wars (October 21, 1805). For a contemporary depiction of the British navy during the Romantic era one might look to the popular fictional series by Patrick O'Brian which follows naval officer Captain Aubrey and his companion Maturin during the Napoleonic Wars or the Hornblower Saga by C.S. Forester which follows Horatio Hornblower as his career in the British navy progresses (also during the Napoleonic Wars). Whatever the reason, a new group of marine artists now made their way onto the scene. Landscape painters found inspiration in the sea and began to create work which was not always accurate, but which could be sold among the less technically sea-savvy art collectors in England.Cordingly, 96. Types of Marine Painting British marine paintings from this era can be divided into three main categories. These are: ship portraits, paintings of ships at sea, and inshore, coastal and harbour scenes.Brook-Hart, 16,28. ::Ship portraits, as mentioned above, were immensely popular before and throughout the Romantic era. Ship portraits were, as apparent by the name, focused entirely on the ship, rather than on the surrounding sea, although the best-known of the ship portraitists strove to carry the accuracy of their drawing out into the atmosphere surrounding the ship (sky, sea, coastlines, etc). Accuracy in all the details of the ship above all was of the utmost importance in ship portraits.Brook-Hart, 16-17. ::Paintings of ships at sea fell into two categories. Paintings of large, full-rigged vessels (such as naval vessels), and paintings of smaller vessels. The former had more prestige and was more expensive, while the later was much easier to come by and generally cheaper. Artists didn't necessarily choose larger or smaller vessels based the skill involved, as their location was often a factor. While some artists worked on/amongst large vessels (traveling with explorers, for example), others worked primarily on the coasts, and so would encounter fishing vessels and the like more frequently than war vessels and such.Brook-Hart, 28-29. Sweethearts and Wives (1860), a harbour scene by the 300px ::Inshore, coastal and harbour scenes were often paintings of smaller vessels, and were (again) more common than paintings of large ships at sea. Coastal pictures offer more possibilities for painters in their depiction of the scene since the depth, quality, and surrounding land of the harbours/coastal areas was much more variant than the monotonous, albeit impressive deep sea.Brook-Hart, 45. Standards Since marine artists in the Romantic era varied in technical knowledge (as noted earlier), there seems to have been a certain amount of debate about how an artist should balance aesthetic/artistic qualities with accuracy in their pictures. This stands in contrast to earlier marine painting (most often in the form of ship portraits for seamen and officers), which was judged solely by accuracy and not valued for artistic quality.Brewington, Preface. The knowledge required for accuracy wasn't necessarily easy to come by. The standards outlined in the Liber Nauticus by Dominic and John Thomas Serres makes clear the level of expertise some expected in marine art. In this instruction manual on how to create marine art, the Serreses' declared: \\"many are the obstacles to the attainment of a proficiency in drawing Marine subjects, particularly as it is not only requisite that a person desirous of excelling in the Art should possess a knowledge of the construction of a ship, or of what is denominated Naval Architecture together with the proportion of masts & yards, the width & cut of the sails, &c; but he should likewise be acquainted with Seamanship\\".quoted in Cordingly, 11. A certain expectation of accuracy is also expressed in a review of two different paintings depicting the Glorious First of June (one‚Äîmore dramatic/fantastical‚Äîby Philip de Loutherbourg and the other by Robert Cleveley, who had long worked as a sailor and whose painting is quite a bit more tame if not as artistically skillful) by Anthony Pasquin (John Williams).Tracy, 11, Benezit, 1128. Pasquin wrote: > Mr. Loutherbourg's picture on this popular subject is too licentious in the > points of historic fact to please any nautical observer. Mr. Cleveley's > performance did not impress me, instantaneously, with so much pleasure as > Mr. Loutherbourg's; but it had this very desirable effect, that my > satisfaction was strengthened in proportion as I viewed it.

Marine Art and the British Public Paintings commissioned by senior naval officers and displayed in the Royal Academy (as were many marine paintings) were not necessarily accessible to the larger British population. However, this does not mean that marine art was confined to the upper classes. Some marine artists and engravers made etchings and aquatints of the pictures bought by art collectors and such, and these copies could be sold to the general public at more affordable prices.Tracy, 5. Working as a print dealer rarely generated a livable income for artists, but a few found success. Thomas and William Daniell, for example, had a reasonable amount of success selling aquatints to the public and to book publishers.Tracy, 34. Influence in America Various English artists influenced the tradition of American marine art, most notably Thomas Butterworth, whose battles of naval depictions during the War of 1812 became very popular among American art collectors. Although Butterworth may have never actually gone there, his work reached America thanks to aquatints of his works done by the English engraver Joseph Jeakes.Wilmerding, 87. So, just as aquatints made British marine art accessible to the general British population, they made British marine art accessible to the American population across the Atlantic. Another British influence on American marine art was Robert Salmon, who began his career in England in 1800, but ended up moving to America and bringing along with him a British \\"topographical style\\" which the younger artists then in New England.Wilmerding, 87. Major British Marine Artists There are far too many talented British marine artists from the Romantic Era to name them all here, but a few are William Anderson, Robert Cleveley, Thomas Luny, George Chambers, Nicholas Pocock, William Hodges, and Philip de Loutherbourg among many others.For more artists, Nicholas Tracy mentions in the preface to his work, Britannia's Palette: E.H.H.

She has served as the President of the People's Party in Catalonia since 6 July 2008. S√°nchez-Camacho was born to Manchego and Extremaduran parents in Blanes. Her father was a Guardia Civil officer. S√°nchez-Camacho was elected as a deputy for the Province of Girona in the Catalan parliamentary elections of 1999 and 2003. She was also elected as the Deputy for Barcelona Province in the Spanish general election of 2004. On 16 April 2008, S√°nchez- Camacho was appointed by the Parliament of Catalonia to replace Daniel Sirera as one of its eight representatives in the Spanish Senate. Following the People's Party's poor performance in Catalonia at the 2008 Spanish general election, Daniel Sirera reluctantly resigned as its regional chairman under pressure from the party's national leader, Mariano Rajoy. S√°nchez-Camacho was Rajoy's chosen candidate for the regional chairmanship. She was challenged by Montserrat Nebrera, who ran on a more liberal-minded platform. Despite having the backing of the national leadership, S√°nchez-Camacho polled a lower-than- expected 56% in winning the run-off election. Ahead of the 2010 Catalan parliamentary election, S√°nchez-Camacho took the unusual step in Spanish politics of setting up the country's tolerance of high immigration as a key campaign topic. Again, in 2013 and 2017, she was involved in the \\"Camargate\\" case, where she recorded a conversation with the objective of incriminating Catalan sovereignist parties and politicians in 2010. Controversies Xenophobic content In April 2010, Alicia S√°nchez-Camacho was forced to apologize publicly for a diptych with radical xenophobic content with allusions to the skinheads of the city of Badalona, edited by the PP of Badalona (Barcelona), which linked Romanian citizens settled in the municipality with crime and the need for radical population increase to eradicate this \\"plague\\". The national leadership of his party had rejected the message the previous day after his complaint by the media. Subsequently, he visited the municipality accompanied by the French MEP Marie Th√©r√®se Sanchez- Schmid to check on the ground the situation of the Romanian Gypsy community in the neighborhoods of Salud and San Roque and hear the testimonies of the neighbors about the alleged bad coexistence with the Romanian community. On that same visit, S√°nchez-Camacho asked the government for more border control and defended a \\"legal and orderly\\" immigration. Camargate In June 2013, a four-minutes conversation, referred to by the media as Camargate, was made public, held with Mar√≠a Victoria \\"Vicky\\" √Ålvarez (former sentimental partner of Jordi Pujol Ferrusola, Jordi Pujol's son) in the restaurant La Camarga, in L'Eixample of Barcelona, carried out by the Detective Agency M√©todo 3, whose total duration was later uncovered by the Diario P√∫blico. The objective of the recording, whose participation S√°nchez-Camacho strongly denied at the time, was to launch the so-called \\"Operation Catalonia\\", a political plot led by the PP against Catalan sovereignist parties and politicians. Declaring that the Pujol family had a fortune in Andorra would, according to Sanchez-Camacho, later \\"start Jordi Pujol Ferrusola's imputation\\". Denying his relationship with the case implied that he loaned false testimony before a judicial declaration and the commission of investigation of the Parlament de Catalunya. The recording took place on July 7, 2010, and its duration was 2 hours and 22 minutes. First, the employee of M√©todo 3 Alejandro Borreguero came to the restaurant with a vase of flowers that had a built-in microphone inside, and that would serve as a centerpiece. The recordings, which had already begun when the employee entered the restaurant shortly before 2:00 p.m., confirmed a conversation between the agent and a manager in which the assignment of S√°nchez-Camacho was alluded to. In addition, he stated that M√©todo 3 would take over the price of the meal. During the recording of the meal, which began after the technician left the restaurant, S√°nchez-Camacho declared \\"Vicky, in the event that we could now do something with all of this, this meal has never happened.\\", \\" I have very good contacts inside the police [...] and I knew who they were going to arrest \\" and, especially, \\"I have a public prosecutor of my trust\\". Later, S√°nchez-Camacho delivered a report with the results of the recording to the Ministry of the Interior, whose president Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az would later also be involved in the \\"Operation Catalonia \\".

The Painted Panorama. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc, 1999. as viewed from inside the center of the circle. Typically shown in rotundas for viewing, Romantic Era panoramas were intended to be so lifelike that the viewer became confused as to what was real and what was image. Creation of the panorama The concept of the panoramic painting was conceived by Robert Barker in 1787 while he was walking on a hill overlooking Edinburgh, Scotland. He obtained a patent for it in the same year. Barker's vision for the panorama was to capture the magnificence of a scene from every angle, immersing the spectator completely. His goal was to blur the line where art stopped and reality began. Barker's first panorama was of Edinburgh, Scotland. He exhibited the Panorama of Edinburgh in his house in 1788, but to little success. The first panorama disappointed Barker, not because of its reception, but because it fell short of his vision. The Edinburgh scene was not a full 360 degrees; it was merely semi-circular. After the limited success of his first panorama, Barker and his son, Henry Aston Barker, completed a panorama of London from the Roof of the Albion Mills. A reduced version was originally shown in their house, and the larger was put on display later. To fulfill his dream of a 360-degree panorama, Barker and his son purchased a rotunda at Leicester Square. London from the Roof of the Albion Mills christened the new rotunda, all of it. The previous version exhibited at their home, in contrast, measured only . The rotunda at Leicester Square had two levels of different sizes. Spectators observed the scenes from a platform in the center of the rotunda Thomas, Sophie. \\"Making Visible: The Diorama, the Double and the (Gothic) subject.\\" Gothic Technologies: Visuality in the Romantic Era. Ed. Robert Miles. 2005. Praxis Series. 31 January 2010, web: ARH. To fully immerse the audience in the scene, all borders of the canvas were concealed. Props were strategically positioned in the foreground of the scene, and two windows were laid into the roof to allow natural light to flood the canvases. These efforts at concealment were done to increase realism to the extent that it was lifted to the fantastical. Two scenes could be exhibited in the rotunda simultaneously, however, the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only one to house two panoramas. Houses with single scenes proved more popular. While at Leicester Square, the audience walked down a long, dark corridor to clear their minds after viewing one panorama and before viewing the next. The idea was to have spectators forget what they just saw, leaving their minds blank to view the second scene. Despite the audience's \\"mind-blanking\\" walk in the dark, painted panoramas were designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer. For some, this attribute placed panoramas in the same category as propaganda of the period, namely that it was no more than an illusion meant to deceive. The panorama evolved somewhat, and in 1809, the moving panorama graced the stage in Edinburgh, Scotland.Wilcox, Scott. \\"Panorama.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 9 February 2010, web: OA-87. Unlike its predecessor, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers to be set up on a stage. The scene or variation of scenes passed between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panoramas in a rotunda. Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th century and into the 20th. Despite the success of the moving panorama, Barker's original vision maintained popularity through various artists including Pierre Pr√©vost, Charles Langlois and Henri F√©lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux among others. The revival of popularity for the panorama peaked in the 1880s after having spread through Europe and North America. Unfortunately, there are no surviving panoramas left. Cultural pesponse In the late 18th and early 19th century, the panorama attracted a diverse audience. The spectators ranged in social standing because an extensive education was not required to view panoramas; panoramas were an art form that could be appreciated by anyone. People could immerse themselves in the scene and take part in what became known as the \\"locality paradox\\".Ellis, Markman. Spectacles within doors: Panoramas of London in the 1790s. Romanticism 2008, Vol. 14 Issue 2. Modern Language Association International Bibliography Database. The locality paradox refers to the phenomenon that happens when spectators become so absorbed in the scene on a panorama that they can not distinguish where they are: Leicester Square or, for example, the Albion Mills. This association with delusion was a common critique of panoramas. Writers feared the panorama for the simplicity of its illusion. Hester Piozzi was among those who rebelled against the growing popularity of the panorama for precisely this reason. She did not like seeing so many people‚Äîelite and otherwise‚Äîfooled by something so simple. Another problem with the panorama was what it came to be associated with. Namely, it redefined the sublime to incorporate the material.Jones, Jennifer J. Absorbing Hesitation: Wordsworth and the Theory of the Panorama. Studies in Romanticism. 45:3, 2006. Modern Language Association International Bibliography Database By associating the sublime with the material, the panorama was seen as an artistic threat‚Äîthe sublime was never supposed to include materiality. The subjects of panoramas transformed as time passed, becoming less about the sublime and more about military battles and biblical scenes. This was especially true during the Napoleonic era when panoramas often displayed scenes from the emperor's latest battle, whether it was a victory or a crushing defeat such as depicted in the Battle of Waterloo in 1816.Meisel, Martin. Realizations. New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1983. Panoramas and romanticism In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes. Such breathtaking sights immediately link panoramas with Romanticism, which is known for its reverence toward the sublime. Despite this similarity, the poet William Wordsworth has long been characterized as an opponent of the panorama, most notably for his allusion to it in Book Seven of The Prelude. It has been argued that Wordsworth's problem with the panorama was the deceit it used to gain popularity. He felt, critics say, that the panorama not only exhibited an immense scene of some kind, but also the weakness of human intelligence. It is safe to assume Wordsworth saw a panorama at some point during his life, but it is unknown which it was. Situation as it is, there is no substantial proof he ever went, but his response in \\"The Prelude\\" seems too grounded upon experience to suggest otherwise. Wordsworth's opposition was to the awe-inspiring scenes of the panorama and of other spectacles of the period that competed with reality. He sought to separate poetry from the phantasmagoria enveloping the population. This was perhaps Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas: their popularity.Haut, Asia. \\"Reading the Visual.\\" Oxford Art Journal: 32, 2, 2009. For Wordsworth, panoramas basically brainwashed their audiences. The panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves. Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation and appreciate it for what it was ‚Äì art. Conversely, J. Jennifer Jones argues Wordsworth was not opposed to the panorama, but rather hesitant about it. In her essay, \\"Absorbing Hesitation: Wordsworth and the Theory of the Panorama\\", Jones argues that other episodes in The Prelude have just as much sensory depth as panoramas had. Jones studied how Wordsworth imitated the senses in The Prelude, much in the same way panoramas did. She concluded that panoramas were a balancing act between what the senses absorbed and what they came away with, something also present in Wordsworth's poetry. By her results then, Wordsworth's similar imitation of the senses proves he was not entirely opposed to them.

Thus, women gambled in private houses at social gatherings that often provided other, more socially acceptable forms of entertainment, such as musical concerts or amateur theatricals.Russell, Gillian. ‚ÄúFaro‚Äôs Daughters‚Äù: Female Gamesters, Politics, and the Discourse of Finance in 1790s Britain.‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Studies (2000): 33.4, p. 484. A group of aristocratic women came to be well known for the faro tables they hosted late into the night. Mrs. Albinia Hobart (later Lady Buckinghamshire), Lady Sarah Archer, Mrs. Sturt, Mrs. Concannon, and Lady Elizabeth Luttrell were common figures in the popular press throughout the 1790s. Gambling's reputation as a dual personal and social vice, especially female gambling, was not new to the late 18th century.Donald, Diana. The Age of Caricature: Satirical Prints in the Reign of George III. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996, p. 106. Charles Cotton‚Äôs The Compleat Gamester from 1674 was still widely cited during the era. However, in the 1790s the issue took on new importance as Britain, influenced by the chaos of the French Revolution, focused its attention with renewed vigor on any threatening domestic issue that could disrupt social order and political power.Russell, Gillian. ‚ÄúFaro‚Äôs Daughters‚Äù: Female Gamesters, Politics, and the Discourse of Finance in 1790s Britain.‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Studies (2000): 33.4. Another factor contributing to a new focus on gaming was the increased importance of the middle classes in late eighteenth-century Britain. The middle class, who depended on credit for both livelihood and reputation, were particularly sour toward the vices in which the landed classes indulged, often without serious repercussions. At the same time, the middle class's avid consumption of the public information about aristocratic gamblers provided by the press made possible their very notoriety. Politics In the Westminster election of 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, a renowned gambler who canvassed for Charles J. Fox, himself a notorious gamester (he in fact ran a faro table in his home from 1780‚Äì81), brought the issue of gaming into the popular media‚Äôs negative portrayal of the aristocracy's involvement in politics.Deutsch, Phyllis. \\"Moral Trespass in Georgian London\\" Gaming, Gender, and Electoral Politics in the Age of George III.\\" The Historical Journal 39.3 (Sep., 1996), pp. 637-656. As a whole, the group aristocratic, gambling women were often associated with the Foxite Whigs.McCreery, Cindy. The Satirical Gaze: Prints of Women in Late Eighteenth-Century England. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2004, p. 237 Lady Archer canvassed for Charles Fox as well, as did the Duchess‚Äôs sister and Lady Duncannon. In other elections, Mrs. Hobart canvassed for Admiral Lord Hood and Sir Cecil Wray. The private version of gaming practiced in the Faro ladies‚Äô homes, furthermore, was ‚Äúa crucial component of the social forum through which women entered the politics,‚Äù because women participated in both the play and political discussion with each other and any males present.Deutsch, Phyllis. \\"Moral Trespass in Georgian London\\" Gaming, Gender, and Electoral Politics in the Age of George III.\\" The Historical Journal 39.3 (Sep., 1996), pp. 647-649. Legal Repercussions The loss of the faro bank; or - the rook's pigeon'd (1797) by caricaturist James Gillray. Justice Ashurst was the first member of the judiciary to speak publicly about the private gambling houses, following George III's ‚ÄúProclamation Against Vice‚Äù of 1792. He referenced statutes existent since the reign of Henry VIII and encouraged his audience, the Grand Jury of Middlesex county, to be ‚Äúvigilant in its administration of the law.‚Äù Voicing the influence of Enlightenment ideals, he emphasized the irrationality of gambling in terms of the health of society.Russell, Gillian. ‚ÄúFaro‚Äôs Daughters‚Äù: Female Gamesters, Politics, and the Discourse of Finance in 1790s Britain.‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Studies (2000): 33.4, p. 489. The legislation concerning Faro in particular set a penalty of ¬£200 for keeping a table and ¬£50 for playing. A few years later, in 1796-97, increased monitoring of lower- class gambling brought about the arguably most famous legal admonishment of the Faro ladies. Henry Weston had committed forgery in order to obtain 100,000 pound from the Bank of England, and then lost the amount at a Faro bank. Lord Chief Justice Kenyon spoke out on May 7, 1796: Caricaturists subsequently published prints depicting Mrs. Hobart and Lady Sarah Archer at the pillory, the victims of an unruly crowd in Gillray's The Exaltation of Faro‚Äôs Daughters and in Richard Newton's Female Gamblers in the Pillory, for example. In early 1797, the discovery of the loss of the faro bank at one of the Ladies‚Äô parties brought them to the forefront of the news once again. Conspicuously outed as a result of this incident, information against Lady Buckinghamshire, Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, Mrs. Sturt, and Mrs. Concannon, and the usual proprietor of their table, Henry Martindale, was heard before Conant, the magistrate of Marlborough Street.Russell, Gillian. ‚ÄúFaro‚Äôs Daughters‚Äù: Female Gamesters, Politics, and the Discourse of Finance in 1790s Britain.‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Studies (2000): 33.4, p. 494 and Ashton, John. History of Gambling in England. London: Duckworth & Co., 1898, p. 78 The informants were two footmen previously in the service of Lady Buckinghamshire, and The Times reported on 13 March 1797 that ‚Äúthe evidence went to prove that the defendants had gaming parties at their different houses in rotation; and, that when they met at Lady B.‚Äôs, the witnesses used to wait upon them in the gambling room‚Ä¶‚Äù Martindale was charged ¬£200, and all but Mr. Concannon ¬£50.Ashton, John. History of Gambling in England. London: Duckworth & Co., 1898, p. 78. ‚ÄúFaro Ladies‚Äù and the press Anti-gaming literature in late eighteenth-century Britain, in the form of satirical prints, newspapers, and serious moral treatises, emphasized the moral, social and political problems associated specifically with female gaming. The growth of the press in the second half of the eighteenth century was a key element to the publicity of the Faro ladies. Scandalous gossip and news about the aristocracy and royalty became common knowledge to the literate public through newspapers and an increasingly popular art form, caricature prints.Hart, Katherine W. James Gillray: Prints by the Eighteenth-Century Master of Caricature. Hanover: Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, 2004, p. 26. These prints made the Faro ladies visible to anyone, literate or illiterate, who happened to be passing a print shop window. The print shops littered the neighborhood in which many of the aristocratic Faro ladies lived and played, St. James, and also middle and lower class neighborhoods, such as The Strand and Covent Garden.Russell, Gillian. ‚ÄúFaro‚Äôs Daughters‚Äù: Female Gamesters, Politics, and the Discourse of Finance in 1790s Britain.‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Studies (2000): 33.4 One caricaturist in particular, James Gillray, made Lady Buckinghamshire and Lady Archer's moral transgressions and gambling habits extremely visible.McCreery, Cindy. The Satirical Gaze: Prints of Women in Late Eighteenth-Century England. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2004, Gillray's prints satirizing the Faro ladies include: Modern-Hospitality,‚Äîor‚ÄîA Friendly Party in High Life (1792); The Exaltation of Faro‚Äôs Daughters (1796); Discipline a la Kenyon (1797); The Loss of the Faro- Bank; or‚ÄîThe Rook‚Äôs Pigeon‚Äôd (1792). Caricature prints often utilized pointed ironic discrepancies to satirize their subjects' vices. For example, in \\"The Exaltation of Faro's Daughters,\\" irony manifests in the discrepancies between the print's image, public shaming on the elevated pillory, and the triple- entendre of ‚Äúexaltation.‚Äù The ladies are physically exalted-raised up-but rather than accordingly esteemed in this position, are actually defamed by a wild crowd who pummel them with garbage and tomatoes. The word also suggests the ‚Äúundue degree of pleasurable excitement‚Äù\\"Exaltation.\\" Oxford English Dictionary Online, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press: 1989. that moral reformers associated with the dangerously sexual dimension of older women's exercise of power via morally reproachable modes such as gaming. Earlier examples from Gillray's predecessor William Hogarth include A Rake's Progress and The Cockpit (1759). Isaak Cruikshank's Dividing the Spoil!! (1796) leverages a scathing commentary on the propriety the Faro ladies have literally gambled away. In this print, four Faro ladies, including Mrs. Hobart and Lady Sarah Archer are compared to four prostitutes through the juxtaposed depiction of counting earnings over a table. The Faro ladies' portrait is labelled \\"St. James,\\" a wealthy aristocratic neighborhood also home to royalty, while the prostitutes' portrait is labelled \\"St. Giles,\\" a notoriously seedy London area. John Ashton's The History of Gambling in England catalogues a series of extracts from The Morning Post and The Times, organs which the public accessed news of these ‚ÄúFaro ladies,‚Äù as they came to be called in the press. Other newspapers that contributed to wider knowledge of social scandal include the Public Advertiser, the Morning Chronicle, and the Morning Herald. The written press allowed the literate public to understand what issue the caricaturist's above were referencing in their prints.Hart, Katherine W. James Gillray: Prints by the Eighteenth-Century Master of Caricature. Hanover: Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, 2004, p. 26. Notes range from simple announcements, who opened their home that week for a Faro party, for example, to condemnations: ‚ÄúIt is impossible to conceive a more complete system of fraud and dishonour than is practiced every night at the Faro Banks.‚Äù Ashton, John. History of Gambling in England. London: Duckworth & Co., 1898, p. 81. However, coverage of the Faro ladies was ubiquitous enough such that all voices on the matter could be heard. A brief note in the ‚ÄúFashion‚Äù section of World from 1791 reads: ‚ÄúDear Ladies of the METROPOLIS, study this PORTRAIT! With the Ladies of PARIS‚Äîthe moments of improving dissipation are gone by, and a more solid and reasoning character has succeeded to them: but you are in the meridian of what is Ton, Taste, high Play, strict Honor, Faro Tables, Parental Affection, Lottery Insurances, and EXQUISITE SENSIBILITY. To jumble all these qualities properly together, forms at once the character of ‚Äì a WOMAN OF CAPITAL FASHION! Follow and Embrace it! Be bold! Be desperate!‚Äù‚ÄúFashion‚Äù in World, Thursday, February 17, 1791, Issue 1289. Moral Reformers When personified, gambling was historically feminine, as ‚Äúan enchanting witchery.‚Äù Russell, Gillian. ‚ÄúFaro‚Äôs Daughters‚Äù: Female Gamesters, Politics, and the Discourse of Finance in 1790s Britain.‚Äù Eighteenth-Century Studies (2000): 33.4, p. 495, quoting Charles Cotton‚Äôs The Compleat Gamester (1674) In other words, ‚Äúfemale emotionality, irrationality, and vulnerability‚Äù was linked to unpredictability and dangerous riskiness of games of chance.Deutsch, Phyllis. \\"Moral Trespass in Georgian London\\" Gaming, Gender, and Electoral Politics in the Age of George III.\\" The Historical Journal 39.3 (Sep., 1996), p. 647. Because a female banker at the Faro table not only played, but also controlled the game, critics saw the Faro ladies as particularly reprehensible examples of sexual misconduct. Women gamblers, after having lost their limited personal income (Pin-money), thus without legal or monetary credit to their name, could only wager their sexuality, i.e. their body. In satirical representations of aristocratic Faro ladies and the writings of moral reformers, prostitution was a common comparison, such as in Isaak Cruikshank's Dividing the Spoil!! (1796). Their sexual unnaturalness was also related to their apparent rejection of domestic duty and intent to exercise power in the public sphere, or at least on its male constituents. Male gamester, George Hanger, asked, for example, ‚ÄúCan any woman expect to give to her husband a vigorous and healthy offspring, whose mind, night after night, is thus distracted, and whose body is relaxed by anxiety and the fatigue of late hours?‚Äù Moral reformers such as Hannah More and William Wilberforce thus feared the Faro ladies power to seduce respectable men and disrupt the ordered distinction between the masculine public sphere and the feminine private sphere, maintained by the fidelity of each party to a marriage. The reformers noted misbehaving older women as bitter and lascivious, as predators who used gaming as a means to compete with young, respectable, fertile women who would maintain an orderly domestic life, upon which the upbringing of a respectable masculine, public sector depended.McCreery, Cindy. The Satirical Gaze: Prints of Women in Late Eighteenth-Century England. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2004. Furthermore, 18th-century social opinion held that the upper classes were to be morally sound role models for the middle and lower classes.McCreery, Cindy. The Satirical Gaze: Prints of Women in Late Eighteenth-Century England. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2004; Donald, Diana. The Age of Caricature: Satirical Prints in the Reign of George III. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996. Thus, one of the reasons the Faro ladies were perceived to be so socially threatening derived from the public and political dimensions of their gaming. Hannah More, for example, writes of gaming women in Strictures: ‚Äú[T]heir example to the young and inexperienced, who are looking about for some sanction to justify them in that which they were before inclined, but were too timid to have ventured upon without the protection of such unsullied names. Thus these respectable characters, without looking to the general consequences of their indiscretion, are thoughtlessly employed in breaking down, as it were, the broad fence which should ever separate two very different sorts of society, and becoming a kind of unnatural link between vice and virtue.‚Äù More, Hannah. Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education. 5th ed. Dublin: 1800. More subtitles her Strictures on the modern system of female education: ‚Äúwith a view on the principles and conduct prevalent among women of rank and fortune,‚Äù clearly allotting them responsibility in shaping the behavior of the lower classes via indirect influence. At the same time, More maintains the need for the \\"broad fence which should ever separate two very different sorts of society.\\" Moral reformers were concerned with the possibility that gambling created for the inappropriate and \\"unnatural\\" mixing of classes. Speaking specifically of women playing at private Faro tables, Patrick Colquhoun identified a similar problem with upper-class influence in A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis writes: ‚ÄúEvil example, when thus sanctioned by apparent respectability, and by the dazzling blandishment of rank and fashion, is so intoxicating to those who have either suddenly acquired riches, or who are young and inexperienced, that it almost ceases to be a matter of wonder that the fatal propensity to Gaming should become universal; extending itself over all ranks in Society in a degree scarcely to be credited, but by those who will attentively investigate the subject.‚ÄùColquhoun, Patrick. A treatise on the police of the Metropolis; ... The sixth edition, corrected and considerably enlarged. London: 1800. pp. 139-140. Colquhoun, like More, gestures to an associated problematic implication of the Faro ladies‚Äô publicity, the loss of clear separation between the classes. According to the social conventions within the middle class, his fear was not ungrounded. The middle class's imitation of ‚Äúgentility,‚Äù which was often practiced in the setting of gaming in private houses, began as a self-conscious mode of ‚Äúcommercial interaction,‚Äù became the ‚Äústandard of expected behaviour.‚ÄùMullin, Janet E. \\"'We Had Carding':Hospitable Card Play and Polite Domestic Sociability Among the Middling Sort in Eighteenth-Century England.\\" Journal of Social History 42.4 (Summer 2009): p. 991. While in reality the middle class made the hospitability and sociality of gaming respectable within their credit-based ethic, the idea of influence and emulation was exploited by anti- gaming moral reformers. The anti-gaming literature posited that not only did the Faro ladies and their associates' vice undermine them as role models, it also muddled the ideally distinct lines separating classes and sexes. Accordingly, in some satirical prints, Faro ladies figured through tropes connoting poverty and vulgarity begged viewers to compare them to the poor in order to illustrate a ‚Äúmoral kinship with the lowest classes.‚ÄùDonald, Diana. The Age of Caricature: Satirical Prints in the Reign of George III. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996. In others, Lady Sarah Archer wears a riding dress to connote the masculine role she takes on through gambling.McCreery, Cindy. The Satirical Gaze: Prints of Women in Late Eighteenth-Century England. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2004, p. 273. More generally, then, the way in which the Faro ladies gaming created a chorus of reactions from moral reformers, the popular press, and the judiciary speaks to Romantic culture's concern with the demarcation and dissolution of public from private, aristocratic from vulgar, male from female. Also, since Faro has such a low house 'edge', it provided more temptation to the banker to cheat, and Faro, in Europe or America, was seen as a cheaters game (see article on Faro (card game)). This added to the immoral image of those women who banked the game, Additional Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Literary Portrayals of Faro Ladies Mary Robinson, Nobody: A Comedy in Two Acts.

Other oil fields are shown in dark gray. The Oxnard Oil Field is a large and currently productive oil field in and adjacent to the city of Oxnard, in Ventura County, California in the United States. Its conventional oil reserves are close to exhaustion, with only an estimated one percent of the original oil recoverable with current technology remaining: out of an original 43.5 million. However, the reservoir includes an enormous deposit of tar sands, ultra-heavy oil classed as an unconventional petroleum reserve, and potentially containing of oil equivalent, should it become economically feasible to extract. p. 6-8 Present operators on the field include Tri-Valley Oil & Gas Co., Anterra Energy Services, Inc., Chase Production Co., and Occidental Petroleum through its Vintage Production subsidiary. p. 97, 122, 118, 160 As of the beginning of 2009, there were 34 active wells on the field. Geographic setting Montalvo field to the west comes here. The Oxnard Oil Field is one of several beneath the Oxnard Plain, an area mostly protected agricultural land with the communities of Ventura, Oxnard, and Camarillo separated by greenbelts. In the vicinity of the oil field, agriculture remains the predominant land use, and oil wells, processing facilities, and associated infrastructure are interspersed with fields planted with crops such as strawberries, broccoli, and onions. Parts of the field, particularly on the west, have been given over to light industrial and commercial development as the Oxnard metropolitan area expands to the east. U.S. Highway 101 bounds the field on the north; California State Route 34 (Oxnard's East 5th Street) cuts across it from east to west, and Rice Avenue crosses it from north to south. Most of the currently active oil wells are in the eastern portion of the field, west of the intersection of 5th Street and Pleasant Valley Road. Some active wells remain west of Rice Avenue, and a group of wells using directional drilling is clustered together in a drilling island near the northeast corner of the intersection of Rose Avenue and Wooley Road. The total productive area of the field projected to the surface is .DOGGR, p. 371 The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with cool, rainy winters and warm, rainless summers, in which the heat is moderated by frequent morning coastal low clouds and fog. Annual precipitation is around , almost all in the winter, and all in the form of rain. The mean annual temperature is 56 to ; freezes occur rarely. Elevations on the field range from about 40 to above sea level. It is mostly flat, with a very gentle slope to the south-southeast; drainage is along Revolon Slough to Calleguas Creek to Mugu Lagoon, and then to the Pacific Ocean.

Oil storage tank adjacent to Tri-Valley center of operations. The Oxnard field is within the Ventura Basin Province of southern California. Geologically, this area is part of a structural downwarp that occurred during the late Pliocene. Rocks within the region are all sedimentary and mostly marine. Oil accumulations, of which there are many in the Ventura province, mainly occur in anticlinal settings modified by faulting; stratigraphy is also influential in creating traps for hydrocarbons. Where the sedimentary rocks are sandstones with high porosity, and the structure and stratigraphy allow hydrocarbons to be trapped on their upward migration, oilfields are found.Keller, Margaret. Ventura Basin Province. 1988, Dept. of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey. p. 1. Available here. As the oil field is in the center of a large flat alluvial floodplain, there is no surface expression of any anticlinal structure capable of holding oil. Under the surface alluvium, a series of relatively impermeable sedimentary units cap the petroleum-bearing formation. On top are the Pleistocene San Pedro and Pleistocene-upper Pliocene Santa Barbara formations; under that the Pico Sands, of Pliocene age, which contain areas of tar sands; under that, separated by an unconformity, the Monterey Formation, of Miocene age, which also contains tar sands (the Vaca Tar Sand); under that, again separated by an unconformity, the relatively impermeable Conejo-Topanga Formation, which caps the faulted anticlinal structure containing medium-grade oil about below ground surface. This producing horizon is named the \\"McInnes\\" pool, and is in the Oligocene-age Sespe Formation.DOGGR, p. 370-372 The Oxnard field contains a large quantity of tar sand, a type of bitumen which is categorized as an unconventional oil deposit. The average depth below ground surface of the tar sands ‚Äì both the Vaca Sand, and the Pico Sand ‚Äì is about , and their thickness ranges from 0 to , representing a total volume of , equivalent to approximately of oil for both units, were it possible to recover their petroleum content. Only a tiny fraction of this has been brought to the surface to date, although Tri-Valley Corporation is actively developing the unit by drilling horizontal wells through the sands and subjecting them to the cyclic steam process. According to Tri-Valley, some of the test wells have shown production rates of , and can be brought online as soon as the steam generators and storage infrastructure are in place on the field.Tri-Valley Corp. description of the Pleasant Valley Project The quality of the oil from the lower pools is good and the gravity medium, at 24 to 38 API, while the oil from the tar sand is extremely heavy and of poor quality, with an extraordinarily high sulfur content ‚Äì API gravity of 7, viscosity of 28,000 to 33,000 centipoise, and sulfur content of between 5 and 7.5 percent by weight. History, production and operations The field was discovered in January 1937 by Vaca Oil Exploration Co., which drilled into tar sands about below ground surface. In spite of the extremely viscous petroleum deposits in the producing formation, which they named after their firm ‚Äì the Pliocene \\"Vaca\\" Tar Sand ‚Äì they were able to produce about . In May of that same year they discovered tar sands in the underlying Monterey Formation from which they were able to produce about of oil per day. Oil wells, tanks, and burn-off flame (left). Agriculture irrigation pipes storage (foreground). More adventurous drillers found deeper producing horizons with lighter oil. In 1953 and 1954 the McInnes, Lucas, and Livingston pools were brought online, producing oil of API gravity 24, 32 and 25-36 respectively. Waterflooding operations in these deeper reservoirs in the 1960s assisted production, but most wells in these horizons were abandoned as the last economically recoverable oil was extracted; a few remained as water disposal wells, as it is usually both economically and environmentally preferable to reinject wastewater back into a depleted reservoir than to treat and release it on the surface. In 2008 only two wells remained active in the deep McInnes reservoir; all the others were in the shallow tar sands.DOGGR 2009, p. 97 Under the California Department of Conservation well adoption rule, Tri-Valley Oil & Gas Company acquired 20 wells formerly operated by defunct GEO Petroleum, Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1998.Company description at Edgar-online Wells declared deserted by the State ‚Äì typically due to the dissolution of the operator ‚Äì are open to adoption and redevelopment under the \\"orphan well\\" rule, with the written consent of the owner of the mineral rights to the property as well as the State Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources. In 2008 Tri-Valley began redeveloping these wells and bringing them back to production. Oil produced in the field goes to the small (-per-day) Oxnard Refinery, owned by Tenby, Inc., in an unincorporated area south of Fifth Street near the eastern Oxnard city limit. This refinery also processes oil from the West Montalvo field on the coast directly west of the Oxnard field.Ventura County Planning Department policies document , p. 8. Oil field waste Anterra operates the only commercial facility that disposes oil field waste through injection wells in the county. In 1998, Anadime Energy Services Inc. applied for permission from the county of Ventura to operate a commercial disposal site at 1933 E. Wooley Road near the Oxnard city limits. This Canadian firm accepted waste from other oil field operators, mostly brine, and injects it thousands of feet into the ground. This permit held by Anterra will expire in 2018 and the commercial oil disposal sites in agricultural land are no longer permitted by county zoning law. The county Board of Supervisors eliminated such a use in farmland two years after the 1998 permit was issued.Wilson, Kathleen and Carlson, Cheri (September 19, 2014) \\"Oil disposal firm disputes county's view of its operating permit\\" Ventura County Star subscription may be required for this article They also denied a zoning change in 2015 that would have allowed expansion of the facility citing the many places of open space and industrial zones where the oil field disposal sites are permitted.

The West Montalvo Oil Field is a large and productive oil field on the coast of Ventura County, California, in the United States, in and adjacent to the city of Oxnard, California. Discovered in 1947, it has produced approximately of oil, and retains about 2.2 million recoverable with current technology, in both the onshore and offshore areas. The offshore portion of the field is exploited from wells directionally drilled from onshore near McGrath Lake, from within an enclosure above the high-tide line at McGrath State Beach.

Geology Detail of the Montalvo field, showing its location relative to Ventura, Oxnard, and other urbanized areas in the coastal region. Yellow dots represent locations of active oil wells as of 2008. The Montalvo field is an accumulation of oil within an eastward-plunging anticline. Within the anticline, numerous Pliocene-age sand units contain petroleum of various types. These sand units pinch out, and many are lenticular, with impermeable units above and below. The anticline is bounded on the north by a branch of the Oakridge Fault, and the anticline itself is broken in many places by small faults perpendicular to the Oakridge.Moir, Leo H. Montalvo Oil Field, Ventura County. AAPG Bulletin, Volume 34 (1950) Within the upper Pico Formation, many lenticular sand units contain natural gas; underneath this unit is the McGrath Zone, which was the first to be discovered, and which contains oil at an API gravity of 28. Beneath the McGrath, and separated by an unconformity, portions of the Miocene-age Santa Margarita and Monterey Formations show in drilling logs; yet another unconformity marks the top of the Colonia Zone, of Oligocene age, which contains more lenticular and pinched-out reservoirs of oil sands.

In 1951, the Colonia Pool was found at , which had a heavier oil with high sulfur content, and following the trend west, discovered the offshore portion of the field in June 1953 by drilling into the Oligocene-age Sespe Formation, where they also found oil at the depth. This producing horizon was also part of the Colonia Zone. This unit remains richly productive. By the end of 2008, the field was one of the top ten in California by largest production increase of the preceding year. Ownership The field has changed owners several times. In 1977, Standard Oil Company of California became Chevron Corporation, and the field was run under that logo. Chevron sold the field to Bush Oil Company of Taft, California, on May 1, 1990. Bush Oil ran the field for only two years, selling it to Berry Petroleum Company in 1992.Well Record for McGrath Well No. 1218; p. 8-13. In 2007, Venoco acquired the field from Berry Petroleum Company for $63 million; it was sold in 2014 to California Resources Corporation for $200 million. Methods of improving production Field operators have tried several enhanced oil recovery projects to improve production rates. In the McGrath pool, gas injection was used from 1956 to 1968, and the zone has been waterflooded since 1963, in an attempt to boost reservoir pressure. Both methods also have been used on the Colonia pool, with gas injection running from 1964 to 1971, and waterflooding since 1960. Enhanced methods have included using water injection to get more tight oil. Oil companies inject the chemical waste water, also called produced water, back into the earth. The presence of water injection wells near directionally drilled oil wells lead one investigative journalist to hypothesize that fracking had occurred. Refining Oil produced in the field goes to the small (-per-day) Oxnard Refinery, owned by Tenby Inc., in an unincorporated area on Fifth Street near the eastern Oxnard city limit. This refinery also processes oil from the Oxnard Oil Field upon which the refinery is located. Other petroleum processing facilities nearby include one west of the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Gonzales Road, as well as two near the Santa Clara River, east of Harbor Boulevard.Ventura County Planning Department policies document, p. 7-8.

The Garden is one of only a very few located on Fairmount Park land, part of Philadelphia's Park System.  History  SRPCG Site Before there was a Garden (1970s) The site that is now the Garden and Schuylkill River Park was previously a B&O; Railroad Station, which ran passenger service to New York City among other places, and the Kelly Brickyards. In the early 1980s, Gardeners began to dig out homemade plots, lay borders from cinder blocks and scrap wood, and start growing. They continued in this way happily for several years until the City of Philadelphia acquired the land and in 1984/1985 attempted to adsorb the site into the nascent Schuylkill River Park, writing the Garden out of these plans.West Philadelphia Landscape Project http://web.mit.edu/wplp/plan/schuyl.htm Behind the effort to remove the Garden was the City's Managing Director at the time, Leo Brooks, who lived directly across the street and did not like looking out at a bare patch during the winter months.Philadelphia Inquirer, May 17, 1988 \\"A THORNY GARDEN SIXTY-EIGHT PLOTS ARE PADLOCKED WHILE THE CITY AND GARDENERS HAGGLE. WHAT WENT WRONG?\\" Like many community gardens, the future of this one was in jeopardy. SRPCG in 1982 #2 Through the extraordinary advocacy efforts of the Center City Residents' Association, led at the time by Bob Davidson and other neighbors, and particularly the strong support of Ernesta Ballard, then a commissioner of Fairmount Park and later president of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the City was persuaded to keep the Garden as part of the Park but only with substantial renovations such that it would prove a beautiful site in summer and in winter. John Collins, architect of Schuylkill River Park, was given this task. At its completion in 1988 the City of Philadelphia via Fairmount Park leased the land to the Center City Residents' Association. The Center City Residents' Association currently acts, through the Garden's Steering Committee, as manager of the site. As a tribute to its uniqueness, in January 2007 the SRPCG was invited to become and became part of the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs Archives of American Gardens. In 2009, the Garden joined PHS' City Harvest Program. In 2010, the Garden became a National Wildlife Federation certified Wildlife Habitat.  Current Garden  The Garden now exists in its general 1988 format and thrives as an urban oasis, outlet for gardening, and space for community building. To preserve access to the Garden as a community resource, Gardeners are limited to six year terms - after which time they must relinquish their plots and go back onto a waiting list before returning to the Garden. As with almost all community gardens and consistent with the terms under which it leases the land, the SRPCG maintains residency boundaries that define to whom plot leases can be made. These boundaries follow those of its parent organization, the Center City Residents' Association, exactly. Even with this limitation, the wait for a plot is still at least 1 ‚Äì 3 years. Starting in 2009 Gardeners began donating hundreds of pounds of produce annually to those in need through the City Harvest Program and working with groups from several local school to provide horticultural opportunities. The City Harvest Program process starts in Philadelphia Prisons, where inmates grow seeds into seedling plants. These plants are distributed to area community gardens who grow them into produce. The produce is donated by gardeners to local food cupboards, who in turn distribute the food to those in need. In the 2010 season, SRPCG distributed over 500 pounds of produce to our food cupboard under the leadership of gardener Linda Zaimis who ran the program in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2008 under the leadership of garden chair Derek Freres (chair for 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 seasons) SRPCG began a preservation and re-building effort to address 20 years of wear and tear including a much needed plot border replacement, new lighting, border irrigation and fencing, bench repair and replacement, plumbing upgrades, among other improvements. In total over $40,000 was raised including a substantial amount from SRPCG Gardeners themselves. In addition a long-term maintenance fund was created during these years that perpetually sets aside a percentage of plot fees paid by gardeners each year to accumulate for future improvements.

Although he did enormous work on plant classification and plant physiology, due to an absence of publications, he is now best known as an early supporter of Carl Linnaeus's system of classification. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1784 Hope was elected as president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (1784-6). Early life Born in Edinburgh on 10 May 1725, John Hope was the son of surgeon Robert Hope and Marion Glas, and a grandson of Archibald Hope, Lord Rankeillor, a Senator of the College of Justice who was in turn the son of Sir John Hope, 2nd Baronet. He was the great-grandson of Sir Thomas Hope, 1st Baronet. He was educated at Dalkeith Grammar School, then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He took leave to study botany under Bernard de Jussieu at the University of Paris, but returned to his studies in Scotland, graduating MD from the University of Glasgow in 1750. For the next decade he practiced medicine, indulging in botany in his spare time. With the death of Charles Alston in 1760, he succeeded him as the 4th Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and King's Botanist and as Professor of Botany and Materia Medica at the University of Edinburgh. However Hope saw his responsibility for materia medica as a threat to his work in botany, and therefore arranged for the chair to be split: Hope became Professor of Medicine and Botany, and a separate chair of Materia Medica are created. In 1763, Hope succeeding in combining the gardens and collections at Trinity Hospital and Holyrood to a new, combined site on the road to Leith. He also succeeded in obtaining a permanent endowment for the garden, thus establishing arguably the first ever \\"Royal Botanic Garden\\". Though he published only a few papers, and is therefore little remembered as a botanist, he made many early physiological experiments. These informed his teaching, but were not published, and were only discovered in his unpublished manuscripts many years after his death. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1767. He was appointed Physician in Ordinary to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1768. In later life he lived at High School Yards on the southern edge of the Old Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1773-74 He died in Edinburgh on 10 November 1786, and was interred at Greyfriars Kirkyard.

She is best known today for her collaboration and friendship with the well known fossil hunter Mary Anning. She was well known in geological circles for her knowledge of fossil fish as well as her extensive collection of specimens and was consulted by leading geologists and palaeontologists of the time including William Buckland, and Louis Agassiz. When Mary Anning discovered that belemnite fossils contained ink sacks, it was Philpot who discovered that the fossilised ink could be revivified with water and used for illustrations, which became a common practice for local artists.Mujeres en la historia Life and friendship with Anning Born in 1780, Elizabeth Philpot and her sisters Louise and Margaret moved to Lyme from London in 1805. They shared a house purchased for them by their brother, a London lawyer. They lived in Lyme for the rest of their lives. The Philpots became well known locally for their fossil collecting, as well as for a home made medication, a soothing salve, that they made and distributed. Elizabeth Philpot befriended Mary Anning when Anning was still a child; despite the almost 20-year age difference and the fact that the working class Anning was from a much poorer background, the two became close and were frequently seen collecting fossils together. Philpot encouraged the young Anning to read about geology and understand the science behind the fossils she collected and sold. Fossils The Philpot sisters' extensive and meticulously labelled fossil collection was used for research by many geologists. All three sisters contributed to the collection, but it was Elizabeth Philpot who corresponded with leading geologists like William Buckland, William Conybeare, and Henry De la Beche about the collection. The collection was well known for its fossil fish. It also contained the fossil teeth that William Buckland combined with a famous partial skeleton discovered by Mary Anning when he described the pterosaur Pterodactylus macronyx (later renamed by Richard Owen to Dimorphodon macronyx), in 1829. In his famous 1824 paper that described the almost complete plesiosaur skeleton discovered by Anning in 1823 Conybeare mentioned examining a plesiosaur skull in the possession of \\"Miss Philpot\\". In 1834 Buckland arranged for the Swiss palaeontologist Louis Agassiz to visit Lyme to work with Elizabeth Philpot and Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region. They were able to show him fossils of 34 different species, and he was so impressed by the knowledge of Philpot and Anning that he wrote in his journal: \\"Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the ichthyodorulites dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types.\\" He thanked both women for their help in his monumental book, Studies of Fossil Fish, and he named a fossil fish species, Eugnathus philpotae, after Philpot and another two species after Anning. Fossil ink In 1826 Mary Anning discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Philpot was able to revivify the ink by mixing it with water and used it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils, and other local artists were soon doing the same as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Legacy The Philpot sisters' important fossil collection ended up at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The Philpot Museum (now known as the Lyme Regis Museum) was built in Lyme Regis in honour of the sisters by their nephew Thomas Philpot. In 2009 Tracy Chevalier wrote a historical novel entitled Remarkable Creatures about Elizabeth Philpot and Mary Anning, and in March 2010 an Australian production company acquired the rights to produce a feature film from the book.

As Fanny Brawne, she met Keats, who was her neighbour in Hampstead, at the beginning of his brief period of intense creative activity in 1818. Although his first written impressions of Brawne were quite critical, his imagination seems to have turned her into the goddess-figure he needed to worship, as expressed in Endymion, and scholars have acknowledged her as his muse. They became secretly engaged in October 1819, but Keats soon discovered that he was suffering from tuberculosis. His condition limited their opportunities to meet, but their correspondence revealed passionate devotion. In September 1820, he left for the warmer climate of Rome, and her mother agreed to their marrying on his projected return, but he died there in February 1821, aged twenty-five. Brawne drew consolation from her continuing friendship with Keats' younger sister, who was also called Fanny. Brawne later married and bore three children, whom she entrusted with the intimate letters Keats had written to her. When these were published in 1878, it was the first time the public had heard of Brawne, and they aroused interest among literary scholars. But they attracted much venom from the press, which declared her to have been unworthy of such a distinguished figure. By contrast, the later publication of Brawne‚Äôs letters to Fanny Keats showed her in a more favourable light, greatly improving her reputation.

She was the eldest of three surviving children; her brother Samuel was born July 1804, and her sister Margaret was born April 1809 (John and Jane, two other siblings, died in infancy).Motion, 1997, p. 323‚Äì324. By 1810, her family was in Kentish Town, and on 11 April of that year her father died, at age thirty-five, of consumption.Motion, 1997, p. 323‚Äì324 Subsequently, Mrs. Brawne moved the family to Hampstead Heath.Motion, 1997, p. 324. It was in 1818 that the Brawnes went to Wentworth Place‚Äî‚Äúa block of two houses, white-stuccoed and semi-detached, built three years before by Charles Armitage Brown and Charles Wentworth Dilke‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 11.‚Äîfor the summer, occupying Brown's half of the property. Fanny was introduced to a society which was ‚Äúvaried and attractive; young officers from the Peninsular Wars, perhaps from Waterloo... exotic French and Spanish √©migr√©s ...from their lodgings round Oriel House in Church Row and the chapel in Holly Place.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 12. After living at Wentworth Place for a brief time the Brawnes became friends with the Dilkes. Time with Keats, 1818‚Äì1821 At eighteen, Fanny Brawne ‚Äúwas small, her eyes were blue and often enhanced by blue ribbons in her brown hair; her mouth expressed determination and a sense of humour and her smile was disarming. She was not conventionally beautiful: her nose was a little too aquiline, her face too pale and thin (some called it sallow). But she knew the value of elegance; velvet hats and muslin bonnets, cr√™pe hats with argus feathers, straw hats embellished with grapes and tartan ribbons: Fanny noticed them all as they came from Paris. She could answer, at a moment‚Äôs notice, any question on historical costume. ... Fanny enjoyed music. ... She was an eager politician, fiery in discussion; she was a voluminous reader. ... Indeed, books were her favourite topic of conversation‚Äù.Richardson, 1952, p. 22‚Äì23 Wentworth Place (left), now the Keats House museum, Hampstead It was through the Dilkes that Fanny Brawne met John Keats in November 1818 at Wentworth Place.Richardson, 1952, p. 23 Their initial meeting was cordial and expected‚Äîthe Dilkes were fond of Keats and spoke of him to the Brawnes often.Walsh, 1999, p. 28. Fanny enjoyed his company, recalling that ‚Äúhis conversation was in the highest degree interesting and his spirits good, excepting at moments when anxiety regarding his brother‚Äôs health dejected them‚Äù;Walsh, 1999, p. 29. On 1 December 1818, Keats's younger brother Tom died of tuberculosis, at age nineteen. Keats's grief was deep, as ‚ÄúSome years before, Keats had written that his love for his brothers was ‚Äúan affection ‚Äòpassing the Love of Women‚Äô‚Äù ... Fanny showed him the depth of her understanding. She gave him invigorating sympathy, keeping his mind from the past and from introspection; she encouraged his love of life by her obvious interest in him, and by her vivacity. Remarkably soon his own gaiety returned.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 24‚Äì25. In a letter begun 16 December 1818 to his brother George, in America, Keats mentions Fanny in two separate passages. The first: \\"Mrs. Brawn who took Brown's house for the summer still resides in Hampstead. She is a very nice woman and her daughter senior is I think beautiful, elegant, graceful, silly, fashionable and strange. We have a little tiff now and then‚Äîand she behaves a little better, or I must have sheered off\\" ; the second: \\"‚ÄîShall I give you Miss Brawn[e]? She is about my height‚Äîwith a fine style of countenance of the lengthen'd sort‚Äîshe wants sentiment in every feature‚Äîshe manages to make her hair look well‚Äîher nostrills are fine‚Äîthough a little painful‚Äîhe[r] mouth is bad and good‚Äîhe[r] Profil is better than her full-face which indeed is not full [b]ut pale and thin without showing any bone‚ÄîHer shape is very graceful and so are her movements‚Äîher Arms are good her hands badish‚Äîher feet tolerable‚Äîshe is not seventeen‚Äîbut she is ignorant‚Äîmonstrous in her behaviour flying out in all directions, calling people such names‚Äîthat I was forced lately to make use of the term Minx‚Äîthis is I think no[t] from any innate vice but from a penchant she has for acting stylishly. I am however tired of such style and shall decline any more of it\\" Keats, John. Letter to George and Georgiana Keats. Dec.‚ÄìJan. 1818‚Äì1819. Charles Brown, 1819 It was not long before Keats fell completely in love with Fanny. ‚ÄúHe had transfigured Fanny in his imagination, his passion creating in her the beauty which for him became the truth; and so she had come to be... the fulfilment of Endymion, the very symbol of beauty, the reconciliation between real life and his poetic quest.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 26. On 18 October 1819, Keats proposed to Fanny Brawne, who accepted. Though a significant event in their lives, they did their best to keep it secret.Motion, 1997, p. 474 Fanny's mother would not be so welcoming of the engagement: Keats had given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry, which, at this point in his life, did not seem to have great prospects. His family had been stricken with illness, and he was unable to sustain himself financially. Her mother did not outright forbid the marriage, but she withheld her legal consent until such time as there was financial stability to match the couple's emotional bond. Keats, by February, was at Wentworth Place, where Fanny visited him frequently and occasionally met his friends, one of whom was Joseph Severn.Richardson, 1952, p. 30‚Äì31. However, ‚Äúas Keats could not dance and was too unwell to take her out himself, she went to parties with army officers. Through the Dilkes and her mother‚Äôs wide circle of friends she received many invitations,‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 31‚Äì32 which caused Keats significant anxiety. This constant presence‚Äîwhich he did not dislike‚Äîdistracted him from poetry; and although he had in May what is regarded as some of the most productive time of his poetic life, he left for the Isle of Wight in June.Richardson, 1952, p. 37‚Äì38 Over the next months Fanny and Keats carried on an emotional, anxious, and somewhat jealous correspondence; he wrote of love and death, and in between letters he wrote and revised poems. He returned to Wentworth Place in 1819, physically and emotionally unwell.Richardson, 1952, p. 50 In early February 1820, Keats went to London and ‚Äúreturned late, cold and feverish. He staggered so badly that Brown thought him drunk. As he got into bed he coughed slightly, and seeing a single drop of blood upon the sheet said to Brown, ‚ÄòI know the colour of that blood;‚Äîit is arterial blood ... that drop of blood is my death warrant.‚Äô Later that night, a large lung haemorrhage followed that almost suffocated him. All he could think of was Fanny.‚ÄùCampion, 2009, p. x. Fanny seldom visited Keats in person over the next month for fear of his delicate health giving out, but occasionally would pass by his window after walks, and the two often wrote notes to each other. In May 1820 Keats decided to leave for Kentish Town; and, over the next months, the two continued an emotional correspondence. Doctors had urged him to relocate to Italy for recovery, as another English winter would most likely prove deadly. He returned, for the last time, to Wentworth Place on 10 August 1820.Richardson, 1952, p. 70. Even the imminence of his leaving for Italy (which was to happen in a month‚Äôs time) did not move Fanny‚Äôs mother to grant her consent to their marriage. She did, however, promise that ‚Äúwhen Keats returned he should marry Fanny and live with them.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 70. On 11 September 1820, Fanny wrote Keats's farewell to his sister, also named Frances; and ‚Äúwith [Fanny‚Äôs] consent he destroyed the letters she had sent him.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 71. Before leaving, they exchanged gifts: ‚Äúperhaps at parting, he offered her his copy of The Cenci and the treasured facsimile of the folio Shakespeare in which he had written his comments and the sonnet on King Lear. He gave her an Etruscan lamp and his miniature, the perfect likeness which Severn had painted of him... Fanny gave him a new pocket-book, a paper-knife, and a lock of her hair, taking one of his own in exchange. She lined his travelling cap with silk, keeping some material in remembrance. She gave him, too, a final token, an oval white cornelian.‚Äù Richardson, 1952, p. 72. Stanley Plumly writes that this good-bye, on 13 September 1820, was ‚Äúthe most problematic... the equivalent, in Keats‚Äôs mind, of leaving life and entering what he will now call, in earnest, his posthumous existence.‚ÄùPlumly, 2008, p. 246. On 1 December 1820 Brown received a letter from Keats, which he read to the Brawnes, \\"skipping & adding, without the slightest suspicion on their part,\\" telling Fanny that if Keats's spirit improved, Severn expected an early recovery‚Äù;Richardson, 1952, p. 79. this illusion was sustained, and all of the worst news was kept from Fanny.Walsh, 1999, p. 121‚Äì122. On 17 February John Taylor, one of Keats's social circle, received a letter from Severn detailing Keats's suffering; ‚ÄúThe doctor said that he should never have left England, for even then he had been incurable; the journey had shortened his life and increased his pain. ... Severn had tried to comfort him with thoughts of spring. It was the season Keats loved best, and he would not know it again. Bitterly he wept. ‚ÄúHe kept continually in his hand a polished, oval, white cornelian, the gift of his widowing love, and at times it seemed his only consolation, the only thing left him in this world clearly tangible.‚Äù‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 83‚Äì84. Fanny wrote to Frances Keats on 26 February, ‚ÄúAll I do is to persuade myself, I shall never see him again.‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 121. ‚ÄúLate on Saturday, March 17, the news reached Wentworth Place. On Friday, February 23, a little before midnight, Keats had died in Severn's arms‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 86. in Rome. The years after, 1821‚Äì1865 Watercolour of Fanny Brawne, 1833. Fanny Brawne cut her hair short, donned black clothing, and wore the ring Keats had given her.Richardson, 1952, p. 87. ‚ÄúA letter from Severn to Taylor reached Hampstead about April 16, and Fanny learned how the Italian health authorities had burned the furniture in Keats's room, scraped the walls and made new windows and doors and floor. She read of the post mortem and the funeral near the monument of Caius Cestius and how Dr. Clark had made the men plant daisies on the grave, saying that Keats would have wished it. Unknown to her family, slowly and with great pain she copied the account of his last days; she did not seal it because his sister might want to read it but she could not read it again.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 89. Fanny felt that the only person with whom she could fully share her grief was Frances KeatsRichardson, 1952, p. 88. and the two carried on correspondence that lasted quite some time. In autumn 1821 Fanny visited the young Keats in Walthamstow, where she was in the care of the AbbeysRichardson, 1952, p. 91. and the two revelled in each other's company. Their constant communication allowed them to develop a close friendship. Eventually Fanny shared with ‚ÄúKeats‚Äôs sister a little of the literary companionship which she had once known with him.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 94. Two years after the death of Keats, Fanny began learning Italian and translating short stories from the German, eventually publishing them in various magazines.Richardson, 1952, p. 107. Frances Keats, having come of age around this time, left the Abbeys and went to live with the Brawnes, where she was warmly welcomed.Richardson, 1952, p. 109. Fanny came out of mourning in 1827, six years after Keats's death.Richardson, 1952, p. 112. She rejoined society and donned brighter, gayer clothing again. This post-mourning period was to be short-lived; her younger brother Samuel, then twenty-three, had been showing signs of consumption. Samuel grew increasingly ill, and on 28 March 1828 he died.Richardson, 1952, p. 113. Fanny's mother, who never fully recovered from Samuel's death, made her will in October 1829. On 23 November 1829, Mrs. Brawne died, some days after her dress caught fire as she led a guest across their garden by candlelight.Richardson, 1952, p. 117. Around 1833, the Brawnes went to reside with a family (the Bakers) in Boulogne.Richardson, 1952, p. 124. It was here that Fanny met Louis Lindo; and, on 15 June 1833, more than twelve years after Keats's death, they married.Richardson, 1952, p. 126‚Äì127. On 26 July 1834, Fanny's first son, Edmund, was born; and on 22 May 1838 her second son Herbert was born.Richardson, 1952, p. 128‚Äì129. On 10 August 1844, her only daughter Margaret was born, in Heidelberg, where they had gone to live.Richardson, 1952, p. 133 It was there, she met Thomas Medwin, who was a cousin and biographer of Percy Bysshe Shelley and the writer of a controversial recollection of Lord Byron. Fanny collaborated with him to correct the impression, provided by Mary Shelley in her Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments (1840), that Keats had gone insane in his final days. Lindo showed letters to Medwin that suggested otherwise, and Medwin used this new knowledge in his Life of Shelley (1847), where he published extracts from these letters by Keats himself and his friend Joseph Severn.Captain Medwin: Friend of Byron and Shelley by Ernest J Lovell Jr. University of Texas 1962 In 1859, after many years abroad, the Lindons (as they had started calling themselves) returned to England.Richardson, 1952, p. 136. Financial troubles towards the end of her life led Fanny to sell her miniature of Keats to Charles Dilke.Richardson, 1952, p. 137. In the autumn of 1865, Fanny told her children about her time with Keats and entrusted to them the relics from that romance, including the letters Keats had written to her, which she said would ‚Äúsomeday be considered of value.‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 136‚Äì138. On 4 December 1865, Fanny Brawne died and was buried the next day in Brompton Cemetery.Richardson, 1952, p. 140. Posthumous controversy The publication of Keats‚Äôs love letters to Brawne Following the death of their father on 21 October 1872, Fanny's children Herbert and Margaret Lindon set about looking for potential buyers of their mother's relics.Walsh, 1999, p. 154. After negotiations with the Dilke family and R. M. Milnes, Herbert decided to publish the letters in book form and auction them some time after.Walsh, 1999, p. 155‚Äì156. ‚ÄúIn February 1878 appeared a slim, elegantly designed volume of under two hundred pages. Edited with an introduction by another of the day‚Äôs prominent literary men, Harry Buxton Forman, it was entitled simply Letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne.‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 156. This move proved shrewd as the publication of the letters caused much interest in England and America. The letters were sold in March 1885 for ¬£543 17s.Walsh, 1999, p. 156. The publication and subsequent auction of Keats's letters led to more than just interest in the affair‚ÄîFanny Brawne was attacked as unfit to be the object of Keats's affection. Sir Charles Dilke, in a review of the collection of letters in the Athenaeum, ‚Äúcalls the book ‚Äúthe greatest impeachment of a woman‚Äôs sense of womanly delicacy to be found in the history of literature.‚Äù‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 157. Louise Imogen Guiney remarked in 1890 that ‚ÄúFanny ‚Äúwas vain and shallow, she was almost a child; the gods denied her the ‚Äòseeing eye,‚Äô and made her unaware.‚Äù Seventy years after the poet‚Äôs death, ‚Äúmost of us are soberly thankful that he escaped betimes from his own heart‚Äôs desire, and his worst impending peril, Mrs. Keats.‚Äù‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 157. Richard Le Gallienne wrote that ‚Äúit is certainly a particularly ironical paradox that the lady irritatingly associated with (Keats‚Äôs) name should be the least congruous of all the many commonplace women transfigured by the genius they could not understand, and the love of which they were not worthy.... Fame, that loves to humour its poets, has consented to glorify the names of many unimportant poor relations of genius, but there has never been a more significant name upon its lips than the name of Fanny Brawne.... One writes so, remembering... the tortures to which she subjected a noble spirit with her dancing-class coquetries.‚ÄùLe Gallienne, 1924, p. 58‚Äì60. The publication of Fanny Brawne‚Äôs letters to Fanny Keats Silhouette of Fanny Brawne, aged 28, 1829. By Augustin Edouart. In 1934, a collector of Keats donated his collection to the Keats Memorial House, Hampstead, on the condition that he should remain anonymous. Included in the donation were the letters that Fanny Brawne had written to Frances (Fanny) Keats between September 1820 and June 1824.Edgcumbe, 1937, p. xv‚Äìxvi. In 1937, Oxford University Press published Letters of Fanny Brawne to Fanny Keats; and Fred Edgcumbe, editor of the volume and curator of the Keats Memorial House, commented in his introduction that ‚ÄúThose who believed in Fanny Brawne‚Äôs devotion to Keats have the satisfaction of knowing that their faith has at last been justified.‚ÄùEdgcumbe, 1937, p. xix. It did not take long for this idea to take general hold. ‚ÄúA leading critic, to then an archfoe of Fanny‚Äôs, almost gladly announced his capitulation. ‚ÄúI have seized the opportunity,‚Äù explained John Middleton Murry, ‚Äúof considering anew the character of Fanny Brawne and the nature of her influence on Keats.‚Äù After reviewing what he‚Äôd written about her twenty-five years before, he says, ‚ÄúI have had the deep satisfaction of being able completely to recant the harsh judgment I then passed upon her.\\"‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 160. This sentiment has remained strong, as ‚Äúin 1993 appeared a book discussing Keats‚Äôs ‚ÄúPoetics, Letters, and Life.‚Äù It ends with a chapter on the notorious love-letters... Fanny is approved as a paragon among women, ‚Äúunsentimental, clear-sighted, frank, inquisitive, animated, kind, and invigorating. Her beauty resonated with the grace that comes of insight and deep abiding affection.‚Äù‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 160. According to Amy Leal, Jane Campion‚Äôs film about Keats‚Äôs and Brawne‚Äôs relationship ‚Äúreflects the critical transformations in Brawne scholarship in recent years,‚Äù painting her as ‚Äúthe steadfast ‚ÄúBright Star‚Äù of Keats's sonnet, and it is Keats who is fickle, torn between his vocation and Fanny... she is La Belle Dame without the nightmare thralldom, witty and chic but also deeply kind and maternal, an aspect of her character that is often missed in readings of her.‚ÄùLeal, 2009 John Evangelist Walsh presents a more moderate approach to Fanny. He remarks that the letters, rather than completely doing away with what had been implied in Keats‚Äôs letters to her, ‚Äúbriefly illuminate another side of the girl‚Äôs character, those quieter personal qualities which had helped attract Keats in the first place but which were not always uppermost. Certainly the letters show her to have been, as Edgcumbe said, intelligent, observant, perceptive, though not unusually so, not to the ‚Äúremarkable‚Äù extent perceived by their well-disposed editor.‚ÄùWalsh, 1999, p. 159. The letter to Brown There is a letter Fanny wrote to Charles Brown in 1829, granting him permission to reproduce for biographical purposes some letters and poems of Keats's concerning his relationship with her without using her name, which has caused scholars attempting to fit it into her life considerable difficulty‚Äîso much so, that the letter is virtually ignored in some major Keats biographiesWalsh, 1999, p. 143. and written off as unimportant in others.Walsh, 1999, p. 143. Of this letter, there are two passages in particular on which critics tend to focus. In the first, which is crossed out in the original manuscript, Fanny tells Brown: ‚ÄúI was more generous ten years ago, I should not now endure the odium of being connected with one who was working up his way against poverty and every sort of abuse.‚ÄùForman, 1952, p. lxiii. The second, which is not crossed out, reads: ‚ÄúI should be glad if you could disprove I was a very poor judge of character ten years ago and probably overrated every good quality he had but surely they go too far on the other side.‚ÄùForman, 1952, p. lxiii. Joanna Richardson writes of the first remark: ‚ÄúOne sentence, removed from its context and published by Dilke‚Äôs grandson in 1875, was to rouse the indignation of half-informed critics for more than sixty years‚Äù;Richardson, 1952, p. 120. and that ‚Äúit suggests the prolonged strain which she had felt during her engagement, and the emotional disturbance caused by her mother's recent death, but it is no evidence of a final change of heart.‚ÄùRichardson, 1952, p. 176. Walsh interprets the second remark to say just the opposite of what Richardson had argued: ‚ÄúFanny is saying that, looking back, she finds her former high opinion of Keats as a man is no longer warranted: she had ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù him. As to why she changed her mind, there exists no direct hint (though it at least deserves recording that in the meantime she had become a fairly wealthy woman, inheriting from her brother who died in 1828, and from her mother). There are only her remarks about being ‚Äúmore generous‚Äù ten years before, and about not liking to recall how she once gave her heart to a little-known young poet struggling to find his way‚Äù.Walsh, 1999, p. 147 See also *Wentworth Place *John Keats's 1819 odes *John Keats bibliography *Bright Star References Bibliography *Campion, Jane, ed.

Illegal logging has been a problem in Madagascar for decades and is perpetuated by extreme poverty and government corruption. Often taking the form of selective logging, the trade has been driven by high international demand for expensive, fine-grained lumber such as rosewood and ebony.Zhu, Annah. 2017. \\"Rosewood Occidentalism and Orientalism in Madagascar.\\" Geoforum Available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.08.010 Historically, logging and exporting in Madagascar have been regulated by the Malagasy government, although the logging of rare hardwoods was explicitly banned from protected areas in 2000. Since then, government orders and memos have intermittently alternated between permitting and banning exports of precious woods. The most commonly cited reason for permitting exports is to salvage valuable wood from cyclone damage, although this reasoning has come under heavy scrutiny. This oscillating availability of Malagasy rosewood and other precious woods has created a market of rising and falling prices, allowing traders or \\"timber barons\\" to stockpile illegally sourced logs during periodic bans and then flood the market when the trade windows open and prices are high.Anonymous. 2018. \\"Rosewood democracy in the political forests of Madagascar.\\" Political Geography. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.06.014 Over 350,000 trees were illegally felled in Madagascar between 2010 and 2015, according to TRAFFIC. The unsustainable exploitation of these tropical hardwoods, particularly rosewood from the SAVA Region, has escalated significantly since the start of the 2009 Malagasy political crisis.Anonymous. 2018. \\"Rosewood democracy in the political forests of Madagascar.\\" Political Geography. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.06.014 Over 350,000 trees were illegally felled in Madagascar between 2010 and 2015, according to TRAFFIC. Thousands of poorly paid Malagasy loggers have flooded into the national parks‚Äîespecially in the northeast‚Äîbuilding roads, setting up logging camps, and cutting down even the most difficult to reach rosewood trees. Illegal activities are openly flaunted, armed militia have descended upon local villages, and a rosewood mafia easily bribe government officials, buying export permits with ease. These illegal operations are funded in part by advance payments for future shipments (financed by Chinese expatriates and Chinese importers) and by loans from large, international banks. Demand is fueled mostly by a growing Chinese middle class and their desire for exotic imperial-style furniture. European and American demand for high-end musical instruments and furniture have also played a role. However, public scrutiny has put significant pressure on shipping companies involved in the trade, and the United States is starting to enforce the Lacey Act by investigating companies with suspected involvement in the illegal trade of Malagasy precious woods. Logging in Madagascar's tropical rainforests has had many secondary effects, beyond the risk of depletion of rare, endemic trees. Habitats have been disturbed, illegal mining has begun, local people have turned to the forests for resources in desperation, and poaching of endangered wildlife has escalated. Lemurs, the most well-known faunal group from the island, have been captured for the exotic pet trade as well as killed for food. Even the most critically endangered species have been targeted, primarily to feed a growing demand for delicacy food in up-scale restaurants. The local villagers have also suffered as tourism has declined sharply or ceased almost entirely. Some have resorted to working as loggers for minimal pay, while others have spoken out against it, often receiving death threats from the rosewood mafia in return. History Being characterized by dilapidated infrastructure and inadequate health care and education systems, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. With a lack of jobs being created by the formal economy, a large informal economy has developed to accommodate. One of the most significant components of this economy has been illegal logging, particularly of the valuable, dense, hardwoods known as rosewood and ebony. Rosewood (of the family Leguminosae) generally has a deep, lustrous red coloration, whereas ebony (of the family Ebenaceae) has a dark, heavy fine wood grain. Malagasy rosewoods include Dalbergia baronii, D. louvelii, and the \\"palissandre wood\\" D. madagascariensis (which lacks the distinctive red coloration). These rare, endemic species are mainly found in the SAVA Region and the Makira-Masoala Landscape of Madagascar. Although rosewood species from other countries have traditionally been used for high-class musical instruments and furniture, these sources have been depleted, leaving Madagascar as one of the leading sources. Ebony, on the other hand, belongs to the large mostly tropical genus Diospyros. The rare, endemic ebony species of Madagascar grow primarily in the northwestern part of Madagascar, but some also grow in Marojejy and Masoala national parks. Both species are slow growing, and take as much as 300 years or more to reach maturity. Rosewood removed from Marojejy National Park by waterway in 2005 The use of these rare hardwoods by local people is limited and sustainable, unlike the unsustainable exploitation from illegal and government-approved logging for international markets. The logging of rosewoods and ebonies in Madagascar can be traced back more than twenty years prior to the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Until recently, the island's forests had not experienced the levels of intense logging seen in countries like Malaysia or Indonesia due to its smaller trees, challenging terrain, and national policies favoring locally controlled, small- scale operations. Forestry laws have been in place since at least the 1960s, and commercial logging has been regulated by the state. For decades, artisanal loggers have extracted high-value trees from most remaining forests on the island. Between 1974 and 1980, logging was permitted in the northern section of the Zombitse protected area. In the 1970s, a logging company received permission from the state to selectively harvest precious hardwoods from Ihera Classified Forest, which continued legally until all trees of commercially valuable size had become rare. However, illegal logging began when local leaders manipulated the remaining loggers to continue the extracting on a smaller scale for their own benefit. The unauthorized logging of these precious woods was banned from sensitive regions (such as national parks) and their adjoining areas in November 2000 with the passing of Order 12704/2000. The law was subsequently amended repeatedly, with orders and memorandums oscillating between permission and bans for the export of logs, semi-finished wood (i.e. planks), and/or finished wood (i.e. furniture), and one, Inter- ministerial Order 16030/2006 (September 2006), reiterating the explicit ban on logging. Conservation groups challenged that none of these held precedence over the original order in 2000, but merely \\"lend a pretext of legality\\" to the export of illegally logged precious woods, and view all recent logging and exports as criminal offenses. So far, operators have only been fined, wood has rarely been confiscated, exports have been permitted, and logging has accelerated, especially near the end of the decade. Hardwoods are still being harvested from protected areas across the island and exported from most of Madagascar's ports. The most significant activity has been occurring in the SAVA Region, and particularly in Masoala National Park and the eastern and northeastern portions of Marojejy National Park‚Äîboth part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana, a World Heritage Site. The terrain in both parks is very rugged, and with only one park ranger per , it is impossible to fend off the loggers. The parks are being targeted because all the rare rosewoods and ebonies outside of Masoala and Marojejy national parks have already been logged. Thousands of workers may be involved in the logging and transporting, especially since the 2009 political crisis, yet the logging and export is orchestrated by only a few dozen powerful \\"Timber Barons,\\" a group of exporters who are some of the wealthiest Malagasy citizens and therefore strongly influence regional and national politics. These include, but are not limited to: *Jeannot Ranjanoro, president of the National Group of Vanilla Exporters *Eugene Sam Som Miock, Madagascar's largest lychee exporter *Jean Paul Rakoto, who has ties to former President Didier Ratsiraka *Martin Bematana, a former member of parliament *Christian Claude Bezokiny, owner of the H√¥tel Hazovola in Antalaha These exporters are supplied by a regional network of collectors and subcollectors, which procures the wood and transports it from the protected forests to the nearest major port, all through the paid labor of teams of young local men who receive between 5,000 and 10,000 ariary, or around US$2.50 to $5.00 per day. This income, which is sometimes not paid, is equivalent to less than 2% of the export value of the logs they cut and transport. A report by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and Global Witness estimated that 200 rosewood trees were being cut down a day in 2009. With prices at around $3000 per cubic meter or $11 per kilogram, the wood was worth nearly ten times as much as oak or maple. The work is done with hand axes and rope, often in remote corners of the forest. The trees are felled and cut into logs, or bola-bola, and dragged for miles to the nearest river, where they are tied into bundles and floated downstream on rafts made of four or five lighter logs. From there, they are transported by truck to a nearby port, such as Antalaha and Voh√©mar. The work is strenuous and very dangerous. Once out of the parks, the logs are transported to open yards or hidden locations in and around Antalaha and Voh√©mar. Sometimes logs are hidden beneath vanilla or buried under gardens, houses, beaches, or in riverbeds. In October 2009, a cache of rosewood was discovered during a raid of Tiko headquarters, a company owned by former president Marc Ravalomanana. Local poverty and the extremely high value of rosewood have driven the local people to violate their local fady (taboos), by cutting down these trees they hold to be sacred. The Deputy Director of Prevention at the Independent Anti- Corruption Office (BIANCO) cites the sharp fall of vanilla prices in mid-2008 (the local cash crop fell from $230 per kilo to $25 per kilo between 2003 and 2005.), the cutting of conservation funding following the political coup in January 2009, and an increased interest in rosewood from mostly Chinese buyers as major factors behind the explosive surge in illegal harvesting of rosewoods. He reported that before this, in 2008, the illegal logging and export of rosewood had been halted. Cyclical exports and cyclone damage Following the bans in 2000 and 2006, exports were restricted to finished or semi-finished products, such as handicrafts. However, exceptions have been made following cyclones that frequently ravage the island's east coast. The export of trees felled by cyclones is permitted, opening a loophole since the government never inventories downed trees. Thus, the timber barons export logs that have been harvested previously, claiming they were a result of storm damage‚Äîa technique historically employed by loggers in the United States and elsewhere. The high density of rosewood prevents them from blowing over in cyclones, leading environmental activists to believe the only purpose is to facilitate illegal logging. Inter-ministerial Order 17939/2004 was passed in September 2004, following Cyclone Gafilo in March, which cleared the way for export of new and existing stocks of rosewood as \\"salvage.\\" This created anarchy in the national parks in the SAVA Region, with loggers extracting a large amounts of rosewood and ebony, grossly disproportionate to the amount of damage caused by the cyclone. During this time, Marojejy National Park reported that with the granting of export rights, logging in the park had resumed. It wasn't until 2006, with the passing of Inter-ministerial Order 16030/2006, that the export ban was reinstated, nearly two years after the storm, but not before the exporters lobbied the government for an extension \\"following the grievances expressed by operators\\" in October 2005, per Memorandum 923/05. Exports were also authorized following cyclones in 2006 and 2007, encouraging the stockpiling of large quantities of lumber in both legal depots and hidden caches around the ports of Voh√©mar and Antalaha. These oscillating bans and authorizations for export have created wave-like market of rising and falling prices for rosewood. During times of stricter control, prices rise considerably while illegally harvested wood is stockpiled in anticipation of future authorizations. When restrictions are removed, large quantities of rosewood are dumped on the market, bringing massive profits for traders before causing a rapid fall in prices. During the intervals between exports, the wood traders, who are also vanilla traders, use the relatively steady income from vanilla exports to fund the extraction of the illegal wood. Cyclones have precipitated illegal rosewood logging in other ways. When Cyclone Hudah hit the island in April 2000, affecting 50,000 people, it exacerbated local poverty. Its devastating effects, later coupled with the downturn in the vanilla market, drove the local people to increase their slash and burn agriculture (called tavy), the use of bushmeat, and the logging of precious hardwoods. Effects of the 2009 political crisis Stump of illegally logged rosewood from Marojejy National Park, Madagascar In late January 2009, increasing political protests led by the mayor of Antananarivo Andry Rajoelina destabilized the Malagasy government. With the backing of the military, former President Ravalomanana was removed from office on March 18, and power was handed power over to Rajoelina, making him the President of the High Transitional Authority of Madagascar. This drew sharp criticism from the international community and resulted in a sharp cut in foreign assistance from donor countries. Foreign embassies also discouraged their citizens from visiting the country, causing a sharp drop in ecotourism‚Äîa critical part of the economy. Coupled with a recent crash in vanilla prices, this has left an already impoverished Malagasy government and economy in an even more desperate state, especially since communities living within the vicinity of the national parks receive half of the park entrance fees. This set the stage for profitable, illegal activities. To meet the surge in demand for Malagasy rosewood, illegal logging of rosewood surged in the SAVA Region, or northeast corner of the island, including Marojejy and Masoala national parks, starting around the time of the first political protests. On January 19, just before the beginning of the riots, the export of precious woods, which had been stockpiled for the past two years, was once again allowed. This permitted the sale of 500,000 logs of rosewood, ebony, and palisandre, along with many more logs that appeared from hidden caches, thus increasing the pressure for renewed logging. When riots and looting broke out in Antalaha on January 27 and 28, the rosewood mafia recovered an estimated of previously seized logs from the Water and Forests Headquarters. Armed militia backed by foreign profiteers (primarily from China)citation needed descended on local villages and began soliciting workers for logging, issuing death threats for villages who opposed them. As a result, the people who had once relied on tourism were left with no other means of support, dividing the community and families. Some turned to the rosewood trade out of desperation, while others who feared prosecution for directly participating in logging instead acted as guides by helping the loggers find the trees. By March 2009, the national parks of the SAVA Region were swarming with thousands of loggers. This period of intense logging lasted six to eight weeks, and park rangers and guides were forced by armed gangs to abandon their posts, resulting in the closure of Marojejy National Park for over a month, from March 20 to May 11. By early April, the roads leading from the parks were streaked with red from rosewood logs that had been dragged across the pavement. In late March, a representative of the Ministry of Environments, Water and Forests for the new government met with NGOs concerned with conservation and declared that stopping illegal logging was a top priority. He proposed the following action plan: # Send gendarmerie to the region as reinforcements for forest control # Use a radio and print campaign to remind people that logging in protected areas is illegal # Ceases export at Vohemar (the primary export location for illegal wood) and assess exports more closely # Annul the permissions for export given in January # Check the visa status of foreign traders in the regions plagued by illegal logging # Replace the head of the Directorate General of Waters and Forests # Police the radio calls promoting logging in the parks However, if any of these actions were taken by the cash-strapped central government, they met only limited success. In fact, all attempts by the transitional authority to implement control over trade have had little effect. Between March and mid- July, authorities in Masoala National Park found a total of 23 stumps, 2,906 logs, 142 logging camps, and over 130 workers within the park. (Few stumps were found because these rare trees are found at low densities‚Äîup to 5 trees per hectare, whereas workers, camps, and logs can be found concentrated along paths cut into the forest.) With an estimated 100 to 200 rosewood trees cut per day during peak harvesting in Masoala and the Mananara Biosphere Reserve, between 23,325 and 46,650 trees were cut in Marojejy and northern Masoala while 7,500 to 15,550 trees were cut in Makira and southern Masoala during 2009. Within the SAVA Region, were affected. It is estimated that $460,000 of rosewood and ebony were harvested per day in 2009, yielding 1,137 containers, or more 24,560 tons, of exported wood worth over $200 million for the year. In Voh√©mar alone, more than 625 containers of precious wood worth approximately $130 million were exported in 2009. In late April alone, 500 containers of wood harvested from protected areas were exported to China. As of February 2010, there had been no shipments of precious wood since December 3, 2009. An estimated 15,700 tons of wood, valued at over $100 million, exist in stockpiles awaiting the next export window. Meanwhile, stocks continue to increase as logging in restricted areas continues. The looting of these forests is well organized and well funded, placing it beyond the regulatory abilities and monitoring of park agents. Workers have been recruited by radio advertisements, the cargo boats of nearby Maroantsetra have all been hired out (to the exclusion of conventional shipping), a road has been built into a remote park in the north, and a flotilla of small boats has been bypassing ports by landing anywhere on the of wild coastline to collect wood. In July 2009, investigation teams observed large-scale transport of rosewood logged from national parks in broad daylight along roads policed by posted gendarmerie around Antalaha, demonstrating that these timber traffickers have bribed not only customs officers but also the local law enforcement. This was after a mid-April attempt by the government to increase law enforcement in the parks and toughen enforcement on the export ban. Illegal activities declined during this time, particularly in areas under closer scrutiny, but also increased activities in remote areas. Malagasy laborers work to conceal rosewood illegally harvested from Masoala National Park by burying it at a beach near Cap Est A few other developments around that time hampered the illegal logging. Shortly before the increased enforcement began in April, about 500 workers gathered in Antalaha, threatening to burn the homes of the rosewood collectors due to continued withholding of their salary. By June, thousands of logs from approximately 20,000 trees had been confiscated in the north-eastern ports of Voh√©mar and Antalaha. However, the economic and political circumstances that were fueling the looting had not changed, allowing illegal logging to continue and driving even the impoverished gangs of Malagasy loggers to accept partial payments for their labor. Eleven environmental organizations condemned the logging in March and later identified the withholding of international aid due to the political crisis as one of the most significant problems fueling these illegal activities. In particular, frozen funds from World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) support capacity building for the national parks, the implementation of chain of custody and tracking for logging, and general funding of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF). In all 70% of the government's operating budget was funded by foreign aid prior to the political turmoil. Since the funding was cut, the government has been strangled by a severe lack of funds, leaving the MEF, for instance, restricted to 10% of its normal budget. Despite pleas from conservation organizations, aid agencies have stood firm on the withholding of aid, arguing that it is the only way send a clear message to the current government that their actions are illegal and disruptive to business relations as well as to pressure them into holding new elections. An alternative view turns the connection between illegal logging and the 2009 political crisis around completely. Instead of the crippling of the government sparking the illegal logging, the drive to exploit valuable resources on public land may have helped drive the political upheaval, especially since these illicit activities have been problems for decades. If members of Madagascar's higher echelons cannot benefit from this highly profitable trade, it could encourage political change. Corruption and violence Government corruption in Madagascar has been a problem for more than a decade. Transparency International has rated the country between a 1.7 and a 3.4 on its 10-point Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), with a score less than 3.0 indicating rampant corruption. With the political disturbance in 2009, Madagascar fell from a 3.4 to a 3.0, and suffered a slide in rank from 85 out of 180 countries to a rank of 99. This downward trend has been demonstrated by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As a result of this bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to make more money for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law. Even when the government has attempted to enforce its own laws, bribery has influenced the outcome. A good example occurred on April 20, 2009, when the port in Voh√©mar reopened two days after authorities closed it down due to international protests over uncontrolled illegal logging. On the same day as the re-opening, loggers that had previously been arrested were released. One day prior, on April 19, prominent timber barons allegedly flew to the capital city by private plane and met with a senior government official. Another example is when a Malagasy court acquitted timber barons because \\"the relevant Forestry Administration official had not properly complied with forest control regulations.\\" In other words, because the Forestry Administration had been bribed, the timber barons were cleared of charges. In many cases, the actions of the criminal syndicates have been direct or even violent. Radio stations have been used to recruit civilians for logging, and on April 20, one person promoted the logging of rosewood in the name of democracy, spawning the resumption of logging in the region. Park rangers and guides at Marojejy National Park were forced away from their posts at gunpoint resulting in the closing of the park in April, and the MEF's regional offices were set on fire and its staff were intimidated. Violent attacks on park staff were documented in August 2009 at Mananara Biosphere Reserve and Masoala National Park, and politicians that have stood up against illegal logging have also faced violent threats or worse. Villagers have lived in fear of the rosewood mafia, silenced and in dire poverty, while people in the coastal city of Sambava demonstrated in strong support of the logging. When remote villagers joined together to protest the destruction of their forests, the armed mafia dispersed them by firing shots over their heads. Throughout the region, local communities that opposed illegal logging lived in fear of retaliation since some informants have received death threats. This has made publicizing the situation very difficult. At the national level, there seems to be only nominal resolve to halt illegal logging. Even the former administrations and members of parliament have been implicated in illegal logging. Given the lack of government funding, the transitional government appears to have little choice but to take money from one of the only profitable industries in the country. Even if the central government wanted to halt the illegal logging and export, they would be hamstrung by decentralization and a lack of funds, leaving them unable to deal with corrupt provincial bureaucrats. In some ways, illegal actions need to be permitted to combat them. For example, twice in 2009 ministerial orders permitted the export of rosewood and ebony, but only if traders were willing to pay a fine of 72 million ariary, or $35,500, per container of illegally harvested wood. Malagasy law calls for the confiscation of illegal wood, not fines. Furthermore, these ministerial orders do not hold legal precedence over Malagasy law. However, the money from these fines will be used to fund the task force that will attempt to combat illegal logging. There are some signs that the situation may be starting to change, as conservation groups and the media spotlight have pressured the government to fire some local officials for participating in illegal exports and send gendarmerie to increase surveillance in part of the SAVA region. They have also promised to more closely monitor the exports that they have temporarily approved. Role of the international market Near the port city of Antalaha, workers process illegally cut rosewood by turning it into planks, which is considered \\"semi-finished form\\" Although timber barons orchestrate the illicit operations, including export, their operations are financed by international sources. This financing comes in the form of down payments of up to half the total sale from foreign buyers and loans from international banks that have branches in Antananarivo. The loans are critical, even in such a profitable industry, because without full payment, most of the capital gets tied up in the stockpiles of logs waiting to be exported. More than two-thirds (11 out of 15) of the major timber barons have received loans from the Bank of Africa Madagascar while the two most important timber barons have received loans from BFV Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, according to cargo manifests from ports in the SAVA Region. In all, 55% of the loans were made by the Bank of Madagascar, while 45% were made by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. Local reports have also indicated that Cr√©dit Lyonnais was also involved in giving loans. Over the course of the political crisis, six nations (in conjunction with the World Bank and three conservation organizations) have called for a stop to this illegal logging in the national parks and other protected areas. Ironically, many of these same governments have either directly or indirectly helped finance these illicit acts through their investments. France, the Netherlands, and Morocco, as well as the World Bank, have been identified as having directly funded these activities. The Bank of Africa is partly owned by France (through the Agence Fran√ßaise du D√©veloppement), the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC), Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), and Banque Marocaine du Commerce Ext√©rieur (BMCE Bank) in Morocco. Also, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale and Cr√©dit Lyonnais are both partly owned by the French government. Most other western governments are significant shareholders in these banks, thus helping channel foreign investment money into this informal economy. Despite this, these governments and banks have not faced the same level of scrutiny from the public as the shipping companies have. However, as of February 2010, the organized trafficking of illegal wood is being investigated by SAMIFIN (the Malagasy Financial Intelligence Services), which is starting to make these international financial organizations reluctant to participate. At a rosewood vase factory in Antalaha, an artisan produces an example of \\"finished form\\" wood for export Several international shipping companies have also previously been implicated in the export of illegally harvested wood from Madagascar, although most of them immediately and unequivocally ceased such operations when confronted with the issue. Between January and April 2009, United Africa Feeder Line (UAFL), based in Mauritius, shipped 80% of the exports out of Voh√©mar and Delmas Shipping, based in France and a subsidiary of CMA CGM, shipped the remaining 20%. According to local sources, Spanfreight and Safmarine Container Lines N.V. have also been involved in the exports, although the EIA and Global Witness report could not substantiate the claim at the time. Other companies, such as Pacific International Lines (PIL), may also be involved or may become involved, but it is difficult to track since containers are transshipped, and effectively laundered, through nearby R√©union or Mauritius. By the end of 2009, only Delmas continued to ship rosewood and other precious woods out of Madagascar, although it was beginning to come under public pressure to stop. Ultimately demand fuels the market for these precious woods. Most of the blame rests with the Chinese and Westerners, who unknowingly prop up this high-priced market through their demand for high- class furniture and musical instruments made from rosewood or ebony. Therefore, the solution lies in public education to help control demand and teach people how their money can indirectly support these illegal activities by providing revenue to companies that directly support them through investment. China Rosewood stockpile sits on a beach near Antalaha, awaiting export to China or Europe China is the largest consumer of tropical woods in the world. As of 2008, it imports 45 million cubic meters of tropical wood per year, a fourfold increase since 1998. Having depleted its own rosewood stands and those of nearby neighbors, such as Burma, Chinese timber importers have focused their attentions on Madagascar. As a result, nearly all of the rosewood exported from the SAVA Region is shipped to Chinese import companies. Malagasy precious woods are primarily shipped to four cities in China: Hong Kong, Dalian, Shanghai, Ganzhou. The international demand for Madagascar's precious woods, such as rosewood and ebony, is growing primarily due to a surge in the numbers of Chinese middle class over the last five years. Furniture, such as armories, beds, and cabinets, styled after ornate designs from the Ming Dynasty fetch up to $10,000, and traditional Chinese instruments are associated with fine red grain of rosewood and have become a popular way for the Chinese middle class to express their new-found wealth. In 2009, the vast majority of the illegally obtained rosewood was exported to several Chinese ports. On October 31 alone, 55 containers holding 7,267 logs, weighing 989 tons and valued at $11 million, were shipped to China from Voh√©mar. It has also been demonstrated that illegal logging is funded with advance payments from Chinese buyers; and that the local rosewood mafia collude with the foreign profiteers, primarily from China. The EIA and Global Witness reported further that logging operations also received significant funds from a network of Chinese importers based in Antananarivo. These importers are part of a recently established expatriate community of Chinese people in Madagascar. Many hold passports due to a questionable practice, started by the Prime Minister under former president Marc Ravalomanana, whereby Chinese immigrants could buy passports for 500,000 ariary or $2,500 per person. According to an October issue of the Madagascar Tribune, these importers operate by selling Chinese household and electronic goods in Madagascar, using artificial customs declarations to under-report both their sales and their revenue, and then instead of repatriating the proceeds, they use the money to finance the tropical wood purchases of their compatriots in the SAVA Region. In addition to the loans from the international banks, this infusion of cash from the new Chinese community is essential to keeping the illegal logging going at times when the wood is blocked from export. According to a local source, boxes of money were unloaded from small planes on November 28, 2009 in Sambava. The money was sent from the bank-like system controlled by the Chinese community in Antananarivo. This infusion of money came in response to two months of blocked rosewood exports at Voh√©mar, involving 170 containers that required a payment of a $35,500 \\"fine\\" per container. Europe and the United States Although Chinese demand constitutes the vast majority of the demand for Malagasy rosewood and other precious tropical woods, they are still popular in Europe and North America‚Äîparticularly rosewood. Between January and April 2009, approximately 1.5% of the wood harvested in the SAVA Region and exported from Voh√©mar made its way directly to Europe in semi-finished form for the production of musical instruments and craft furniture. The tree species in these shipments consisted mostly of ebony, palissandre, faho, and andrapotsy. In some cases, the wood is shipped to China, where it is crafted into products that are eventually sold in the United States and Europe as high-end goods. Given the lack of documentation, many importers do not know the species of rosewood used or the country of origin, making it difficult for North American and European companies to filter out illegal products. Steps are being made to encumber the illegal timber trade by Western countries. In one such instance, federal agents from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service raided Gibson Guitar Corporation's Massman Road manufacturing facility on November 17, 2009 and reportedly confiscated wood, guitars, computers, and boxes of files on the grounds of a possible violation of the Lacey Act, which holds U.S. companies to the environmental laws of foreign countries. Reportedly, the company was involved in plans to ship wood from Madagascar to the United States through Germany. Charges have not been filed, and Gibson Guitar released a statement that it was cooperating fully with the investigation. The day following the raid, CEO Henry Juszkiewicz took a leave of absence from the board of the Rainforest Alliance. Gibson Guitar holds a chain-of-custody certification from the Rainforest Alliance, however wood from Madagascar is not covered under that certificate. Another company that has been identified as having ties to the illegal timber trade in Madagascar is Flavour Handling LLC. Reports show that Jeannot Ranjanoro, one of Madagascar's most noteworthy timber traffickers, exports rosewood under this Delaware-based corporation. If the allegations are true, they may come under investigation under the Lacey Act and face prosecution. International outcry and effects on shipping Unlike the international banks, shipping companies have been the primary target of the public outcry over the illegal logging and timber trading in Madagascar. Several companies were shown to have been involved in the shipping of rosewood, but most willingly ended their participation when the issue was called to their attention. Delmas, which had been the most prominent transporter of rosewood in 2009, has received the brunt of the attention due to its reluctance to cease its transport of wood. The company originally dismissed criticisms by citing authorizations to export from Madagascar's Minister of Environment and Forests. Workers load illegally logged rosewood onto a transport vessel bound for the nearest major port In December 2009, international outcry was generated and channeled through the internet by activist networks, such as Ecological Internet, over a rosewood shipment scheduled for December 21 or 22 from Voh√©mar. Both the French government and Delmas were targeted with mass emailing while the French delegation at climate talks in Copenhagen were notified of Delmas' EU FLEGT Action Plan violation, which conflicts with France's position on reducing illegal logging to reduce emissions from deforestation. As a result, the shipment was canceled. Two weeks after the cancellation, representatives from Andry Rajoelina's government began pressuring Delmas to pick up the shipment, which included more than 200 containers worth $40 million. Threats from Patrick Leloup, an adviser to Rajoelina, were reportedly issued to Delmas, stating that their refusal to transport the wood would result in a ban from doing business in Madagascar. Delmas was targeted because it was the only company that had enough empty containers in Voh√©mar to transport the shipment. Under pressure, Delmas began to show signs that its position might change. Despite previous reports of being \\"enraged\\" by previous timber exports, Rajoelina may have turned to rosewood exports to fund his financially isolated government. Signing a decree on December 31, 2009, his transitional authority authorized the export of rosewood stocks in Voh√©mar, with the first pick-up scheduled for January 15, 2010. However, on January 13, Delmas once again refused to ship rosewood in fear of tarnishing its reputation. In March, Delmas succumbed to pressure from the Malagasy government and resumed rosewood shipments with permission of the French government. However, near the end of March the Malagasy government, in turn, gave in to public pressure and reinstated the ban on rosewood logging and exports for two to five years with decree number 2010-141. Confiscated logs The confiscation of illegally harvested woods is called for by Malagasy law in accordance with the Forestry Act. However, confiscations have only happened on a small scale, and the wood usually ends up back in the hands of the timber barons. For example, on previous occasions seized wood has been stamped and auctioned off, only to be re-obtained by exporters. Other seized stockpiles have either mysteriously disappeared, or have been stolen back from government headquarters when riots have broken out. This raises concerns about what effects proper law enforcement would have on the trade, since it may only postpone the problem. Since small-scale auction for international consumption have previously failed, the destruction of seized logs has been discussed in the conservation literature. Although this approach has been taken in Africa to deal with confiscated ivory, the burning of the wood would produce significant pollution and would be dangerous and complicated to control. Another option involves allowing the local wood crafting community to transform the wood into finished goods, thus bringing money into economically devastated parts of the country. However, the sheer volume of wood currently in stockpiles far exceeds what the local craft community could process, leaving large stocks in storage for decades. Protecting these stored stocks would be problematic at best. Also by promoting the use of these precious woods for crafts, a market is created and people's livelihoods become dependent upon it. Once the confiscated stocks are depleted, once again there will be demand to resume logging. Another proposed option involves the auctioning of log ownership at their current market value (approximately $1,300) with the money going towards a forest fund. Beneficiaries, selected from those negatively impacted by the logging, would receive operating funds from the sales. Additionally, they would receive engraved logs (bola-bola) for display at protected areas, villages, and education or health centers as reminders of the destruction that peaked during 2009 and 2010. Environmental and social impacts A Malagasy worker extracts a heavy rosewood log from Masoala National Park. The work is very strenuous and pays little, if at all. Although not as immediately devastating as large- scale clearcutting, the selective logging taking place in Madagascar's protected areas creates secondary effects that can be just as harmful, if not more so, to both the local environment and local communities. These effects include the introduction of invasive species, increased susceptibility to fire due to localized drying, impaired habitat, reduced genetic diversity and biodiversity, and collateral damage from dragging the trees out of the forest. In some cases, the disturbances create enough unbalance to cause the forest to die off completely. Human activities also tend to increase, further destroying what remains. Poaching and wildlife trafficking, as well as illegal mining have been documented in newly disturbed areas. Furthermore, local communities can be negatively impacted. Local villagers have been threatened into silence or exploited for cheap, dangerous labor, and all of these activities within the forest often violate local taboos. With decades of illegal logging in Madagascar's protected areas it comes as little surprise that evidence of closely associated activities, such as slash-and-burn agriculture, tree cutting, honey extraction, and bushmeat hunting, were discovered in Marojejy National Park by a research team in 2008. With the recent political instability, these transgressions have increased in frequency and severity along with the illegal logging, and now threaten the existence of critically endangered lemurs and other species. This has done irreparable damage and jeopardized over thirty years of conservation work. The sheer size of the areas already affected during 2009 highlight the threats posed by illegal logging in Madagascar, particularly in the SAVA Region. The total areas impacted include between in Marojejy and northern Masoala, in Makira and in southern Masoala. To make matters worse, extensive forest clearing has been occurring around the parks' rivers. Since it takes four to five lighter trees (such as Dombeya species) to create a raft to float the much denser, heavier rosewood logs, loggers cut these lighter trees along the riverside first, causing erosion and silting of the streams and rivers. According to the EIA and Global Witness report, observations suggested at that 200 to 400 lighter trees were being cut per day to transport the rosewood. Hapalemur griseus), killed for bushmeat in northeast Madagascar. The meat is often consumed by loggers or sold to up-scale restaurants as a delicacy. Lemurs and other endemic wildlife have become the target for poachers, a problem that has increased significantly since the large-scale illegal logging has commenced. Malagasy reptiles have long been a target of animal traders, but as smuggling of these species has intensified, now lemurs are also being collected and illegally exported for the exotic pet trade. Initially following the political upheaval, conservation organizations were concerned that lemurs and other wildlife would be hunted for food by the thousands of loggers living and working in the protected areas. This indeed has happened, although the scale of the damage is unknown. However, unlike the bushmeat problems in other tropical countries, the majority of the meat from illegal hunting has not gone to feeding the hungry, impoverished rural populations. Instead, a \\"luxury market\\" has developed in the larger towns, including the capital, Antananarivo. Around Makira, lemurs have been tracked using trained dogs, killed, smoked on-site, and sold to up-scale restaurants around the region. In August 2009, photos of piles of dead lemurs that had been confiscated from traders and restaurants in northern Madagascar were published by Conservation International. The numbers of killed and exported lemurs are unknown, but they include the indri and the critically endangered silky sifaka and golden- crowned sifaka. Marojejy alone contains eleven species of lemur, including the silky sifaka. Illegal logging has affected more than just the forests and the wildlife. Communities living around the national parks rely heavily on tourism for economic support since they receive half of the park entrance fees. Some community members also work as guides, porters, shopkeepers, hotel and restaurant personnel, so when tourism declines or ceases, their lives and the local economy they help fuel fall into jeopardy. Other communities receive fewer benefits from tourists, particularly around Masoala and Marojejy National Parks, which are difficult to reach and have minimal infrastructure. However, logging is still physically demanding and dangerous work that offers minimal pay, leaving them few options. Still, much of the logging and lemur hunting at Masoala is done by members of nearby communities. Emigrants coming into the region likewise have limited or no opportunities for earning income, making these illegal activities their only option. The influx of immigrant loggers introduces new risks for the local communities, such as rural food shortages, and increase in crime rate, and an increase in the rate of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV. Although the increased economic activity introduced by logging might be seen as a benefit, the windfall is mostly seen by the traders and not the rural Malagasy poor, who do the strenuous physical labor for minimal pay. Some locals have abstained from logging from fear of prosecution, while others have turned to logging out of desperation. With armed militia occupying villages and issuing death threats towards people who object to their activities, people live in fear and communities and families have been divided.

History The bridge was once located in Fairfield County, south of Amanda on Clear Creek.http://www.graveaddiction.com/bcbridge.html The bridge was built in 1875 in the multiple kingpost truss style. The county contains many examples of that style built by Fairfield native and expert covered bridge builder, James W. Buchanan, the man credited as being the builder of the Shaeffer Campbell Bridge. The bridge was damaged when a farm tractor fell through the floor in 1973, and it was donated to Belmont County in 1975.http://www.graveaddiction.com/bcbridge.html Belmont County did not have any covered bridges at the time, as its last covered bridge over Captina Creek had collapsed under the weight of a coal truck in 1953. The bridge was dismantled and taken to a county garage in Lloydsville, where it was reassembled and reconditioned. The bridge was placed over the College Pond in 1975 with a dedication by the county engineer, R.J. Boccabella. Appearance The wooden bridge sits atop wooden slat-pressured trusses that reach into the muddy bottom of the College Pond. The railings of the approaches to the bridge are designed to mirror railings found on the home of famous American writer Mark Twain. The flat wooden floor of the bridge was built to support loads of wagons and horses, but has not been reinforced for automobile usage, leaving it closed to vehicular traffic but open to pedestrians, such as a cross country event for local high schools every year. The bridge has slanted front supports, allowing the roof to extend further than the sides. The shingles on the roof are laid in a way to allow water to run off without leaking through the small gaps between panels. The sides of the bridge are wooden planks nailed vertically with a small gap between the roof and the top of the side walls. The bridge is normally painted red and is visible from both lanes of Interstate 70, which runs less than south of the bridge.

The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Snapdragon (Lorna Leigh Raeburn) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #1 (December 1986). The codename \\"Snapdragon\\" was introduced in issue #2. Snapdragon remained a regular character until her death in issue #4. She was the first regular character to die in the series, opening a long string of deaths. Fictional character biography Nothing is known of Lorna Leigh Raeburn's life prior to her joining Strikeforce: Morituri. A sassy, confident young woman, at some point, in 2073, she volunteered for the Morituri program, a program which could confer superhuman abilities to ordinary people, to be used in the ongoing war of Earth against the evil alien race known as the Horde. However, the powers came at a terrible price: the recipients invariably died within a year of taking the process, their powers flaring up and their bodies rejecting their newly inserted metabolism with fatal results. Undaunted, Lorna applied for the process and was found genetically compatible to undertake it, one in only six among thousands of applicants. As such, Lorna was subjected to the process, becoming part of the first official generation of Strikeforce: Morituri.Strikeforce: Morituri #1 Later, the team members were sent to the Garden (the nickname of Biowar Zone Alpha), a booby-trapped artificial environment, whose objective was to help the heroes manifest their superhuman powers by exposing them to extreme danger and stress. Lorna was the only one of her teammates who was not threatened by any of the myriad traps of the Garden. Instead, her powers surfaced when her panicked teammate, Vyking, snapped out and accused their Commander, Beth Nion, of trying to kill them, seeing how she had not aborted the test sequence, despite the other members of the team almost dying in the process. Enraged at his accusations against their Commander, Lorna slapped him, simultaneously releasing her plasma burst for the first time, as a result of her extreme anger. After the team members all succeeded in the Garden trial, Lorna assumed the codename \\"Snapdragon\\" and incorporated wrist mounted projectors in her costume, which could help her focus her bursts more effectively.Strikeforce: Morituri #2 In the next few weeks, Snapdragon and Vyking becoming getting closer to each other, although they never spelled out explicitly any feelings. In the first official mission of the team, in Kramatorsk, Soviet Union, Snapdragon proved exceptionally effective when her teammate, Radian used his E-M radiation emissions to help propel her plasma bursts.Strikeforce: Morituri #3 Death Sometime later, the team was invited to a party in New York City, where they met the actors who would portray them in an upcoming soap opera. The party was interrupted by the intrusion of some Hordian soldiers. During the battle, Snapdragon began experiencing an exhilarating surge of power, the first indication of the deadly Morituri effect catching up. After the battle was over, Snapdragon realized her time was up. Horrified, she ran to get a safe distance from those nearby before vaporizing, her death recorded by countless cameras. She was the first member of her generation of Morituri to die.Strikeforce: Morituri #4 Powers and abilities Snapdragon had the ability to generate plasma bursts, which she focused through the wrist mounted projectors she wore. As a result of her exposure to the Morituri process, she also possessed enhanced strength and agility.

In 2000, club fans of both Mansfield Town and Hull City voted Wagstaff their club's player of the century ‚Äì the only player to be named by two football league clubs. During club centenary celebrations in 2004 he was voted \\"The greatest player to play for Hull City AFC\\" by supporters. Amazingly once again he was voted for by both Mansfield and Hull City fans as \\"all-time favourite player\\" in 2007. Career In 1960, as a 17-year-old, Wagstaff was signed by Mansfield Town F.C's then-manager Raich Carter after playing in Mansfield's youth league. Carter put him in the first team squad and he made his league debut on 30 August 1960. In his first game with Mansfield's first squad, the team won, scoring 2‚Äì1 over Rochdale. Wagstaff scored both Mansfield goals and he went on to score 93 goals over 181 appearances for Mansfield Town, attracting attention from larger clubs. On 12 November 1964, Hull City paid a then-record purchase fee of ¬£40,000 for Wagstaff. Wagstaff scored 31 goals in the promotion season and went on to score 173 goals for Hull City in 378 appearances. Wagstaff played for Hull City between 1964 and 1975, scoring 197 goals for the club. In the 1970s, Wagstaff joined the Sunshine George Cross Football Club in Melbourne Australia as a player-coach. After a career-ending knee injury, Wagstaff spent a short period on the club's coaching staff. Retirement and personal life In November 2002, Wagstaff celebrated his 60th birthday at the Ramada Jarvis Hotel in Willerby with 350 friends, including players from the Hull City 1965‚Äì66 Third Division championship team. Author John Maffin wrote a biography about Wagstaff, Waggy: The Ken Wagstaff Story. Wagstaff co-operated with the author and the book was published in 2002 with a second edition published in 2004. In 2005, as part of Hull City's club centenary celebrations, Wagstaff was voted by supporters as the \\"best Hull City player of all time\\". After retiring from his football career, Wagstaff ran The Golden Ball pub (since demolished) and then bought The Marlborough club, affectionately known as \\"Waggies\\". He has since sold the club and retired, but remains active in philanthropy and charity work in the local Kingston upon Hull community. In 2003, Wagstaff joined a group of footballers in a \\"World Cup-style tournament\\" to raise money to assist children with learning difficulties. In 2006, he participated in the Sport Relief Mile in Hull to raise money for marginalised people, and in 2007, he took part in a charity golf tournament at Bridlington Belvedere Golf Club. Wagstaff's wife Eileen died from breast cancer in August 2007. In February 2008, Wagstaff and his family raised money to start a lifestyle centre in her memory at the Princess Royal Hospital in Saltshouse Road, east Hull. The centre would provide breast cancer patients with diet and lifestyle advice. After a brief stint during 2009 running the Roos Arms, a village pub in Roos, East Riding of Yorkshire he has since completely retired to spend more time with his family and now lives in Hull.

Froman appeared on 56 episodes of Matlock from 1986 to 1994 as Lt. Bob Brooks. He also appeared on several other television shows of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Hill Street Blues, Trapper John, M.D., 21 Jump Street, Cheers and Diagnosis Murder. In addition, he played Captain K'Nera in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Froman was also well known for his role of both Gunther Wagner, Schuyler Whitney's faithful servant, and also his twin brother, Bruno on series The Edge of Night. As Bruno, he first appeared from 1980 to 1981 and assumed Gunther‚Äôs identity. He was murdered on the show a year later. The real Gunther was brought back in the show's final years from 1982 to 1984. Gunther was featured until the end of the show acting as Sky Whitney‚Äôs chauffeur. He shared a two-year flirtation with Mitzi Martin and eventually kissed her for the first time in the show‚Äôs final telecast.

Barbara George, chairwoman of NEO's Fine Arts Department, said, \\"... the respect for Froman among students and faculty members was so great that any praise from him, 'made us all glow.

Accessed online 2010-02-10. a similar but far less common form is hexasyllabic (six syllables to a line) and is known in Spanish as romancillo (a diminutive of romance); that, or any other form of less than eight syllables may also be referred to as romance corto (\\"short romance\\").Rodr√≠guez-Fischer p. 92n gives romance corto and romancillo as synonyms for one another. A similar form in alexandrines (12 syllables) also exists, but was traditionally used in Spanish only for learned poetry (mester de clerec√≠a). Poems in the romance form may be as few as ten verses long, and may extend to over 1,000 verses. They may constitute either epics or erudite romances juglarescos (from the Spanish word whose modern meaning is \\"juggler\\"; compare the French jongleur, which can also refer to a minstrel as well as a juggler). The epic forms trace back to the cantares de gesta (the Spanish equivalent of the French chansons de geste) and the lyric forms to the Proven√ßal pastorela. In the Spanish Golden Age, however, which is when the term came into wide use, romance was not understood to be a metrical form, but a type of narration, that could be written in various metrical forms. The first published collection of romances, Mart√≠n Nucio's Cancionero de romances (about 1547), was, according to Nucio's prologue, published not as poetry, but as a collection of historical source materials. Despite a considerable amount of poetic theory and history published during that period, there is no reference to romance as a term of meter prior to the nineteenth century. It did not mean an 8-syllable meter.Daniel Eisenberg, ‚ÄúThe Romance as Seen by Cervantes‚Äù, El Crotal√≥n.

Plasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but, in the class of moldable polymers, this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability. Plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances. They are usually synthetic, most commonly derived from petrochemicals, however, an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters.Life cycle of a plastic product. Americanchemistry.com. Retrieved 2011-07-01. In developed economies, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping, plumbing or vinyl siding. Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic), furniture, and toys. In the developing world, the applications of plastic may differ‚Äî42% of India's consumption is used in packaging. Worldwide, about 50 kg of plastic is produced annually per person, with production doubling every ten years. Plastics have many uses in the medical field as well, with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic. The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials, but rather the meaning of the word plasticity, with regard to the reshaping of flesh. The world's first fully synthetic plastic was bakelite, invented in New York in 1907, by Leo Baekeland who coined the term \\"plastics\\". Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger who has been called \\"the father of polymer chemistry\\" and Herman Mark, known as \\"the father of polymer physics\\". The success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of large molecules. Toward the end of the century, one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward recycling. Etymology The word plastic derives from the Greek œÄŒªŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (plastikos) meaning \\"capable of being shaped or molded\\" and, in turn, from œÄŒªŒ±œÉœÑœåœÇ (plastos) meaning \\"molded\\".Plastikos, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus.

The plasticity, or malleability, of the material during manufacture allows it to be cast, pressed, or extruded into a variety of shapes, such as: films, fibers, plates, tubes, bottles, boxes, amongst many others. The common noun plastic should not be confused with the technical adjective plastic. The adjective is applicable to any material which undergoes a plastic deformation, or permanent change of shape, when strained beyond a certain point. For example, aluminum which is stamped or forged exhibits plasticity in this sense, but is not plastic in the common sense. By contrast, some plastics will, in their finished forms, break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the technical sense. Structure Most plastics contain organic polymers. The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, 'pure' or with the addition of: oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The chains comprise many repeat units, formed from monomers. Each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units. The backbone is the part of the chain that is on the \\"main path\\", linking together a large number of repeat units. To customize the properties of a plastic, different molecular groups \\"hang\\" from this backbone. These pendant units are usually \\"hung\\" on the monomers, before the monomers themselves are linked together to form the polymer chain. It is the structure of these side chains that influences the properties of the polymer. The molecular structure of the repeating unit can be fine tuned to influence specific properties of the polymer. Properties and classifications Plastics are usually classified by: the chemical structure of the polymer's backbone and side chains; some important groups in these classifications are: the acrylics, polyesters, silicones, polyurethanes, and halogenated plastics. Plastics can also be classified by: the chemical process used in their synthesis, such as: condensation, polyaddition, and cross-linking.Classification of Plastics . Dwb.unl.edu. Retrieved on 2011-07-01. Plastics can also be classified by: their various physical properties, such as: hardness, density, tensile strength, resistance to heat and glass transition temperature, and by their chemical properties, such as the organic chemistry of the polymer and its resistance and reaction to various chemical products and processes, such as: organic solvents, oxidation, and ionizing radiation. In particular, most plastics will melt upon heating to a few hundred degrees celsius.Periodic Table of Polymers Dr Robin Kent ‚Äì Tangram Technology Ltd. Other classifications are based on qualities that are relevant for manufacturing or product design. Examples of such qualities and classes are: thermoplastics and thermosets, conductive polymers, biodegradable plastics and engineering plastics and other plastics with particular structures, such as elastomers. Thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers The plastic handle of a spatula that has been deformed by heat. One important classification of plastics is by the permanence or impermanence of their form, or whether they are: thermoplastics or thermosetting polymers. Thermoplastics are the plastics that, when heated, do not undergo chemical change in their composition and so can be molded again and again. Examples include: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).Composition and Types of Plastic Inforplease website Common thermoplastics range from 20,000 to 500,000 amu, while thermosets are assumed to have infinite molecular weight. Thermosets, or thermosetting polymers, can melt and take shape only once: after they have solidified, they stay solid. If heated again, they do not melt; they decompose instead. In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber is an example of a thermosetting process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material; after vulcanization, the product is rigid and non-tacky. Amorphous plastics and crystalline plastics Many plastics are completely amorphous, such as: all thermosets; polystyrene and its copolymers; and polymethyl methacrylate. However, some plastics are partially crystalline and partially amorphous in molecular structure, giving them both a melting point, the temperature at which the attractive intermolecular forces are overcome, and also one or more glass transitions, the temperatures above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased. These so-called semi-crystalline plastics include: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides (nylons), polyesters and some polyurethanes. Conductive polymers Intrinsically Conducting Polymers (ICP) are organic polymers that conduct electricity. While plastics can be made electrically conductive, with a conductivity of up to 80 kS/cm in stretch-oriented polyacetylene, they are still no match for most metals like copper which have a conductivity of several hundred kS/cm. Nevertheless, this is a developing field. Biodegradable plastics and bioplastics Biodegradable plastics are plastics that degrade, or break down, upon exposure to: sunlight or ultra- violet radiation, water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes or wind abrasion. In some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack can also be considered as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation. Some modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface (aerobic), whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems (anaerobic). Some companies produce biodegradable additives, to enhance biodegradation. Plastic can have starch powder added as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily, but this still does not lead to the complete breaking down of the plastic. Some researchers have genetically engineered bacteria to synthesize completely biodegradable plastics, such as Biopol; however, these are expensive at present. Bioplastics While most plastics are produced from petrochemicals, bioplastics are made substantially from renewable plant materials such: as cellulose and starch. Due both to the finite limits of the petrochemical reserves and to the threat of global warming, the development of bioplastics is a growing field. However, bioplastic development begins from a very low base and, as yet, does not compare significantly with petrochemical production. Estimates of the global production capacity for bio-derived materials is put at 327,000 tonnes/year. In contrast, global production of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), the world's leading petrochemical derived polyolefins, was estimated at over 150 million tonnes in 2015.

History Plastic (LDPE) bowl, by GEECO, Made in England, The development of plastics has evolved from the use of natural plastic materials (e.g., chewing gum, shellac) to the use of chemically modified, natural materials (e.g., natural rubber, nitrocellulose, collagen, galalite) and finally to completely synthetic molecules (e.g., bakelite, epoxy, polyvinyl chloride). Early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins, which are organic polymers. In around 1600 BC, Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls, bands, and figurines. Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the Middle Ages. Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk-proteins (casein) with lye. In the nineteenth century, as industrial chemistry developed during the Industrial Revolution, many materials were reported. The development of plastics also accelerated with Charles Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber. Blue plaque commemorating Parkes on the Birmingham Science Museum. Parkesine (nitrocellulose) is considered the first man-made plastic. The plastic material was patented by Alexander Parkes, in Birmingham, England in 1856. It was unveiled at the 1862 Great International Exhibition in London. Parkesine won a bronze medal at the 1862 World's fair in London. Parkesine was made from cellulose (the major component of plant cell walls) treated with nitric acid as a solvent. The output of the process (commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin) could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated. By incorporating pigments into the product, it could be made to resemble ivory. In 1897, the Hanover, Germany mass printing press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards. The resultant horn-like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed in cooperation with the Austrian chemist (Friedrich) Adolph Spitteler (1846‚Äì1940). The final result was unsuitable for the original purpose. In 1893, French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde, producing material marketed as galalith. In the early 1900s, Bakelite, the first fully synthetic thermoset, was reported by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland by using phenol and formaldehyde. After World War I, improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion in new forms of plastics, with mass production beginning in the 1940s and 1950s (around World War II). Among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were polystyrene (PS), first produced by BASF in the 1930s, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), first created in 1872 but commercially produced in the late 1920s. In 1923, Durite Plastics Inc. was the first manufacturer of phenol-furfural resins. In 1933, polyethylene was discovered by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) researchers Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett. In 1954, polypropylene was discovered by Giulio Natta and began to be manufactured in 1957. In 1954, expanded polystyrene (used for building insulation, packaging, and cups) was invented by Dow Chemical. The discovery of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is credited to employees of the Calico Printers' Association in the UK in 1941; it was licensed to DuPont for the US and ICI otherwise, and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances, resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe.  Plastics industry  monobloc plastic chairs in a rural area of Cameroon. The monobloc produced in polypropylene is one of the most produced chair designs in the world. Plastics manufacturing is a major part of the chemical industry, and some of the world's largest chemical companies have been involved since the earliest days, such as the industry leaders BASF and Dow Chemical. In 2014, sales of the top fifty companies amounted to . The firms came from some eighteen countries in total, with more than half of the companies on the list being headquartered in the US. Many of the top fifty plastics companies were concentrated in just three countries: * United States: 12 * Japan: 8 * Germany: 6 BASF was the world's largest chemical producer for the ninth year in a row. Trade associations which represent the industry in the US include the American Chemistry Council. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry. Natural gas prices have dropped so low that gas producers were burning if off on-site (not being worth the cost to transport it to cracking facilities). In addition, bans on single-use consumer plastic (in China, the European Union, Canada, and many countries in Africa), and bans on plastic bags (in several states in the USA) has reduced demand for plastics considerably. Many cracking facilities in the USA have been suspended. The petrochemical industry has been trying to save itself by attempting to rapidly expand demand for plastic products worldwide (i.e. through pushbacks on plastic bans and by increasing the number of products wrapped in plastic in countries where plastic use is not already as widespread (i.e. developing nations)).Will coronavirus be the death or salvation of Big Plastic ? Industry standards Many of the properties of plastics are determined by standards specified by ISO, such as: * ISO 306 ‚Äì Thermoplastics Many of the properties of plastics are determined by the UL Standards, tests specified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), such as: * Flammability ‚Äì UL94 * High voltage arc tracking rate ‚Äì UL746A * Comparative Tracking Index Additives Blended into most plastics are additional organic or inorganic compounds. The average content of additives is a few percent. Many of the controversies associated with plastics actually relate to the additives:Hans-Georg Elias \\"Plastics, General Survey\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. organotin compounds are particularly toxic. Typical additives include: Stabilizers Polymer stabilizers prolong the lifetime of the polymer by suppressing degradation that results from UV-light, oxidation, and other phenomena. Typical stabilizers thus absorb UV light or function as antioxidants. Fillers Many plastics contain fillers, to improve performance or reduce production costs. Typically fillers are mineral in origin, e.g., chalk. Other fillers include: starch, cellulose, wood flour, ivory dust and zinc oxide. * most fillers are relatively inert and inexpensive materials, make the product cheaper by weight. * stabilizing additives include fire retardants, to lower the flammability of the material. * some fillers are more chemically active and are called: reinforcing agents. Plasticizers Plasticizers are, by mass, often the most abundant additives. These oily but nonvolatile compounds are blended in to plastics to improve rheology, as many organic polymers are otherwise too rigid for particular applications. :Dioctyl phthalate is the most common plasticizer. Colorants Toxicity Pure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they are biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols. Whereas the finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic. In some cases, small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed. For example, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recognized vinyl chloride, the precursor to PVC, as a human carcinogen. Bisphenol A (BPA) Some polymers may also decompose into the monomers or other toxic substances when heated. In 2011, it was reported that \\"almost all plastic products\\" sampled released chemicals with estrogenic activity, although the researchers identified plastics which did not leach chemicals with estrogenic activity. The primary building block of polycarbonates, bisphenol A (BPA), is an estrogen-like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food. Research in Environmental Health Perspectives finds that BPA leached from the lining of tin cans, dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals' offspring. A more recent animal study suggests that even low-level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance, which can lead to inflammation and heart disease. As of January 2010, the LA Times newspaper reports that the United States FDA is spending $30 million to investigate indications of BPA being linked to cancer.Andrew Zajac FDA issues BPA guidelines, Los Angeles Times, January 16, 2010 Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, present in plastic wrap based on PVC, is also of concern, as are the volatile organic compounds present in new car smell. The European Union has a permanent ban on the use of phthalates in toys. In 2009, the United States government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic.Lisa Wade McCormick More Kids' Products Found Containing Unsafe Chemicals, ConsumerAffairs.com, October 30, 2009 Environmental effects This infographic shows that there will (predicted) be more plastic in the oceans than fish by 2050. Most plastics are durable and degrade very slowly, as their chemical structure renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation. There are differing estimates of how much plastic waste has been produced in the last century. By one estimate, one billion tons of plastic waste have been discarded since the 1950s. Others estimate a cumulative human production of 8.3 billion tons of plastic of which 6.3 billion tons is waste, with a recycling rate of only 9%. Much of this material may persist for centuries or longer, given the demonstrated persistence of structurally similar natural materials such as amber. The Ocean Conservancy reported that China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined. The rivers Yangtze, Indus, Yellow River, Hai River, Nile, Ganges, Pearl River, Amur, Niger, and the Mekong \\"transport 88‚Äì95% of the global [plastics] load into the sea.\\" The presence of plastics, particularly microplastics, within the food chain is increasing. In the 1960s microplastics were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentrations. The long-term effects of plastic in the food chain are poorly understood. In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastic, although estimates vary according to region. Meanwhile, 50‚Äì80% of debris in marine areas is plastic. Prior to the Montreal Protocol, CFCs were commonly used in the manufacture of polystyrene, and as such the production of polystyrene contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer.  Microplastics  Decomposition of plastics Plastics contribute to approximately 10% of discarded waste. Depending on their chemical composition, plastics and resins have varying properties related to contaminant absorption and adsorption. Polymer degradation takes much longer as a result of saline environments and the cooling effect of the sea. These factors contribute to the persistence of plastic debris in certain environments. Recent studies have shown that plastics in the ocean decompose faster than was once thought, due to exposure to sun, rain, and other environmental conditions, resulting in the release of toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A. However, due to the increased volume of plastics in the ocean, decomposition has slowed down. The Marine Conservancy has predicted the decomposition rates of several plastic products. It is estimated that a foam plastic cup will take 50 years, a plastic beverage holder will take 400 years, a disposable nappy will take 450 years, and fishing line will take 600 years to degrade. In 2018, a survey by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey (GOES) Foundation found that the ecosystem in seas and oceans may collapse in the next 25 years, potentially causing failure of terrestrial ecosystem and \\"very possibly the end of life on Earth as we know it\\"; the main agents of this prediction were hypothesized to be plastic, ocean acidification, and ocean pollution. In order to prevent such a catastrophe, experts have proposed a total single-use plastic ban, wood burning bans while planting \\"as many trees as possible,\\" \\"pollution-free recycling of electronics, and by 2030 all industries to be zero toxic discharge.\\" One British scientist advocates \\"special protection and perservation of peat bogs, wetlands, marshlands and mangrove swamps to ensure carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere.\\" Microbial species capable of degrading plastics are known to science, and some are potentially useful for the disposal of certain classes of plastic waste. * In 1975 a team of Japanese scientists studying ponds containing waste water from a nylon factory, discovered a strain of Flavobacterium that digested certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture, such as the linear dimer of 6-aminohexanoate. Nylon 4 or polybutyrolactam can be degraded by the (ND-10 and ND-11) strands of Pseudomonas sp. found in sludge. This produced Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a byproduct. * Several species of soil fungi can consume polyurethane. This includes two species of the Ecuadorian fungus Pestalotiopsis that can consume polyurethane aerobically and also in anaerobic conditions such as those at the bottom of landfills. *Methanogenic consortia degrade styrene, using it as a carbon source. Pseudomonas putida can convert styrene oil into various biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates. * Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch have been shown to be capable of degrading polypropylene. * The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus effectively degrades plasticized PVC. Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been grown on PVC in a mineral salt agar. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Lentinus tigrinus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus sydowii can also effectively degrade PVC. Phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown on PVC in a mineral salt agar. *Acinetobacter has been found to partially degrade low molecular weight polyethylene oligomers. When used in combination, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Sphingomonas can degrade over 40% of the weight of plastic bags in less than three months. The thermophilic bacterium Brevibacillus borstelensis (strain 707) was isolated from a soil sample and found capable of using low-density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated at 50 degrees Celsius. Pre-exposure of the plastic to ultraviolet radiation broke chemical bonds and aided biodegradation; the longer the period of UV exposure, the greater the promotion of the degradation. * Less desirably, hazardous molds have been found aboard space stations, molds that degrade rubber into a digestible form. * Several species of yeasts, bacteria, algae and lichens have been found growing on synthetic polymer artifacts in museums and at archaeological sites. * In the plastic-polluted waters of the Sargasso Sea, bacteria have been found that consume various types of plastic; however it is unknown to what extent these bacteria effectively clean up poisons rather than simply releasing them into the marine microbial ecosystem. * Plastic eating microbes also have been found in landfills. *Nocardia can degrade PET with an esterase enzyme. * The fungus Geotrichum candidum, found in Belize, has been found to consume the polycarbonate plastic found in CDs. *Phenol-formaldehyde, commonly known as bakelite, is degraded by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. * The futuro house was made of fibreglass-reinforced polyesters, polyester- polyurethane, and poly(methylmethacrylate). One such house was found to be harmfully degraded by Cyanobacteria and Archaea. Recycling  Climate change  In 2019, the Center for International Environmental Law published a new report on the impact of plastic on climate change. According to the report plastic will contribute Greenhouse gases in the equivalent of 850 million tons of Carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in 2019. In current trend, annual emissions will grow to 1.34 billion tons by 2030. By 2050 plastic could emit 56 billion tons of Greenhouse gas emissions, as much as 14 percent of the earth's remaining carbon budget. The effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sinkEPA. (2012). Landfilling. although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions. Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption. For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy. Production of plastics Production of plastics from crude oil requires 62 to 108 MJ/Kg (taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of 35%). Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming: 230 to 235 MJ/Kg of silicon, and about 3,000 MJ/Kg of semiconductors. This is much higher than the energy needed to produce many other materials, e.g. iron (from iron ore) requires 20-25 MJ/Kg of energy, glass (from sand, etc.) 18‚Äì35 MJ/Kg, steel (from iron) 20‚Äì50 MJ/Kg, paper (from timber) 25‚Äì50 MJ/Kg. Incineration of plastics Controlled high-temperature incineration, above 850 ¬∞C for two seconds, performed with selective additional heating, breaks down toxic dioxins and furans from burning plastic, and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration. Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further. This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies. Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such toxic fumes. Pyrolytic disposal Plastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels, since plastics include hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon.The Hindu Dec. 12, 2005. Retrieved on 2011-07-01. Representative polymers Molded plastic food replicas on display outside a restaurant in Japan Plastic piping and firestops being installed in Ontario. Certain plastic pipes can be used in some non-combustible buildings, provided they are firestopped properly and that the flame spread ratings comply with the local building code. Bakelite The first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant \\"composite\\" materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in a meeting of the American Chemical Society.Watson, Peter. A Terrible Beauty (also published as Modern Mind: An intellectual history of the 20th century). London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson Ltd (imprint of Orion Books). 2001 Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s. Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic. Polystyrene Styrene polymerization Unplasticised polystyrene is a rigid, brittle, inexpensive plastic that has been used to make plastic model kits and similar knick- knacks. It also is the basis for some of the most popular \\"foamed\\" plastics, under the name styrene foam or Styrofoam. Like most other foam plastics, foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an \\"open cell\\" form, in which the foam bubbles are interconnected, as in an absorbent sponge, and \\"closed cell\\", in which all the bubbles are distinct, like tiny balloons, as in gas-filled foam insulation and flotation devices. In the late 1950s, high impact styrene was introduced, which was not brittle. It finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties. Polyvinyl chloride Vinylchloride polymerization Polyvinyl chloride (PVC, commonly called \\"vinyl\\") incorporates chlorine atoms. The C-Cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation (and burning). PVC is stiff, strong, heat and weather resistant, properties that recommend its use in devices for plumbing, gutters, house siding, enclosures for computers and other electronics gear. PVC can also be softened with chemical processing, and in this form it is now used for shrink-wrap, food packaging, and rain gear. All PVC polymers are degraded by heat and light. When this happens, hydrogen chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs. Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to form hydrochloric acid, polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term archival storage of silver, photographic film or paper (mylar is preferable). Nylon The plastics industry was revolutionized in the 1930s with the announcement of polyamide (PA), far better known by its trade name nylon. Nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber, introduced by DuPont Corporation at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City. In 1927, DuPont had begun a secret development project designated Fiber66, under the direction of Harvard chemist Wallace Carothers and chemistry department director Elmer Keiser Bolton. Carothers had been hired to perform pure research, and he worked to understand the new materials' molecular structure and physical properties. He took some of the first steps in the molecular design of the materials. His work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber, which was very strong but also very flexible. The first application was for bristles for toothbrushes. However, Du Pont's real target was silk, particularly silk stockings. Carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides including polyamide 6.6 and 4.6, as well as polyesters. General condensation polymerization reaction for nylon It took DuPont twelve years and US$27 million to refine nylon, and to synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture. With such a major investment, it was no surprise that Du Pont spared little expense to promote nylon after its introduction, creating a public sensation, or \\"nylon mania\\". Nylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of 1941 when the US entered World War II. The production capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings, or just nylons, for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended, DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering the so-called nylon riots. Subsequently, polyamides 6, 10, 11, and 12 have been developed based on monomers which are ring compounds; e.g. caprolactam. Nylon 66 is a material manufactured by condensation polymerization. Nylons still remain important plastics, and not just for use in fabrics. In its bulk form it is very wear resistant, particularly if oil-impregnated, and so is used to build gears, plain bearings, valve seats, seals and because of good heat-resistance, increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars, and other mechanical parts. Poly(methyl methacrylate) Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), also known as acrylic or acrylic glass as well as by the trade names Plexiglas, Acrylite, Lucite, and Perspex among several others (see below), is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. The same material can be utilised as a casting resin, in inks and coatings, and has many other uses. Rubber Natural rubber is an elastomer (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) that originally was derived from latex, a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (vulcanization), improving elasticity and durability. In 1851, Nelson Goodyear added fillers to natural rubber materials to form ebonite. Synthetic rubber The first fully synthetic rubber was synthesized by Sergei Lebedev in 1910. In World War II, supply blockades of natural rubber from South East Asia caused a boom in development of synthetic rubber, notably styrene-butadiene rubber. In 1941, annual production of synthetic rubber in the U.S. was only 231 tonnes which increased to 840,000 tonnes in 1945. In the space race and nuclear arms race, Caltech researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets. Ultimately, all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based solid fuels, and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.

Early life and education  Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, O'Higgins was raised there and in San Diego, California. In 1922 he abandoned his first career as a pianist and entered the Academy of Arts in San Diego. Within two years he'd become a student of Diego Rivera, assisting Rivera on his murals at the National School of Agriculture at Chapingo, and the Public Education Secretariat.Rochfort, Desmond, Mexican Muralists: Orozco, Rivera Siqueiros, Chronicle Books, San Francisco, 1993  Mexico and murals  Like Rivera, O'Higgins became an active member of the Mexican Communist Party. He immigrated to Mexico permanently in 1924, joined the party in 1927, and maintained his party membership until 1947. His political illustrations for the Daily Worker won him a year's study at the Academy of Art in Moscow on a Soviet Scholarship in 1933. In 1937, O'Higgins was the co-founder, with fellow artists Leopoldo M√©ndez and Luis Arenal, of the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular (\\"People's Graphic Workshop\\"). The Taller became inspiration to many politically active leftist artists; for example, American expressionist painter Byron Randall went on to found similar artist collectives after becoming an associate member.Makin, Jean, ed.

Becoming Pablo O‚ÄôHiggins. San Francisco/Salt Lake City: Pince-Nez Press. In May 1940 O'Higgins had the honor of being the only non-native Mexican artist with work included in the seminal \\"Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art\\" exhibit organized by the Museum of Modern Art. In 1961 O'Higgins was awarded honorary Mexican citizenship for \\"his contributions to the national arts and education\\". One of his murals can be seen at the Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market, Mexico City. His 1945 mural for the Ship Scalers Union Hall in Seattle is installed in Kane Hall at the University of Washington in Seattle. The mural depicts Seattle's Ship Scalers Union‚Äôs (SSU) history as a strongly anti-racist, anti- discriminatory, and progressive force in social politics. Among O'Higgins' students was the American graphic designer Bob Cato, and artist and muralist Marion Greenwood. Further reading * Acevedo, Esther. \\"Young Muralists at the Abelardo L.

United States congressional redistricting  2001‚Äì2011 Before the 2000 election, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives was evenly split with 100 members from the Republican and Democratic parties and 3 vacancies. After the 2000 election, Republican elected 104 Republican house seats and 99 Democratic seats. Republicans also maintained control Pennsylvania State Senate, maintaining 30 Republican seats and 20 Democratic seats. Republicans also controlled the Pennsylvania Governorship. This would ensure the 2000 census redistricting process was led by the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania General Assembly. Following the 2000 census, Pennsylvania Republicans would have full state control of the redistricting process. Pennsylvania Senate Bill 1200 was introduced by Republican State Senators Brightbill and Lemmond on November 16, 2001. On December 10, 2001, the Senate considered amendments to Senate Bill 1200. A Republican amendment was ultimately agreed to. The version of Senate Bill 1200 that eventually passed the Senate contained a population deviation of twenty-four persons. After an amendment by the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, that chamber passed Senate Bill 1200 on December 12, 2001. The version of Senate Bill 1200 that passed the House had a total population deviation of nineteen persons. It also maintained two minority-majority districts in the Philadelphia area, created one open seat in the southeastern part of the Commonwealth and paired two Democratic incumbents in the same district. One Democratic incumbent was paired against one Republican incumbent. The Senate refused to concur in the amendments to Senate Bill 1200 offered by the House of Representatives. A Conference Committee was appointed and a plan was eventually devised that contained a nineteen-person deviation. This Conference Committee Report on Senate Bill 1200 was passed by the Senate on January 3, 2002 and by the House of Representatives later the same day. It was signed into law by Governor Mark Schweiker on January 7, 2002. Vieth v. Jubelirer In Vieth v. Jubelirer, a United States Supreme Court case challenging the constitutionality of the 2000 redistricting process, the Supreme Court was unable to agree upon a legal standard for judging when partisan gerrymandering violated the United States Constitution. Effects After the 2000 elections, Pennsylvania Republicans held a slim 11 to 10 congressional seat majority over the Democrats. In the 2002 Pennsylvania House of Representatives elections: * Republicans expanded their majority in House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, winning 12 seats to the Democrats 7 seats. * After the 2000 U.S. Census, Pennsylvania lost two congressional districts: Pennsylvania's 20th and 21st congressional districts. Republican Phil English, U.S. Representative of the 21st congressional district, would later be redistricted to 3rd congressional district, where he won reelection. Democratic Frank Mascara, U.S. Representative of the 21st congressional district, was redistricted to the 18th congressional district, but moved to and lost renomination in the 12th congressional district to fellow Democratic Representative John Murtha. * In the newly redrawn 6th congressional district, Republican Jim Gerlach won the seat for the Republicans, after Democrat Representative Tim Holden was redistricted from the 17th congressional district, where he won reelection. Democrat Representative Robert Borski was redistricted from the 3rd congressional district, to the 6th congressional district, but retired from Congress. * Democrat Mike Doyle, U.S. Representative for 18th congressional district, would later be redistricted to 3rd congressional district, where he won reelection unopposed. This would be maintained until the 2006 Democratic wave election, when Democrats won 11 of the 19 elections for the United States House or Representatives. 2011‚Äì2021  Congressional districts drawn in 2011  In the 2010 Pennsylvania elections, Republicans won a landslide victory, with Tom Corbett winning the 2010 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, recapturing the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and regained their majority in House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, winning 12 seats to the Democrat's 7 seats. Following the 2010 census, Pennsylvania Republicans would have full state control of the redistricting process for the second decade in a row. On September 14, 2011, Republican senate leadership introduced a congressional redistricting bill which contained neither a map nor description of proposed congressional district lines. The proposed lines were added in the senate State Government Committee on December 13, 2011. The committee approved the bill 6-5 along party lines. Breaking with his party, Republican Sen. Mike Folmer opposed the Republican bill, saying \\"all you have to do is look at (the map)\\" to see it appeared to be specifically drawn to dilute Democratic votes and was the perfect example of why redistricting reform is needed. Barry Kauffman, lobbyist for Common Cause of Pennsylvania, agreed with Folmer, saying the plan \\"is a clear-cut case of politicians picking their voters in order to prevent voters from having a meaningful opportunity to pick their elected officials.\\" On December 14, 2011, the bill returned to the senate, which passed it the following day.The Tribune Democrat, \\"U.S. House redistricting maps delayed,\\" December 12, 2011 Prior to senate passage, senate Democrats proposed an amendment to use a different map. Advocating for the change, Democratic Senator Vincent Hughes argued that under both plans, the Democrats could only count on four districts, but the Republicans would go from 12 safe districts to eight. In the Republican plan two districts would be \\"swing\\" districts, but the Democrats' plan would have six. This amendment was defeated on a party line vote. The Senate voted to approve the new map by a 26-24 vote on December 14, 2011.The Times-Tribune, \\"Senate approves redistricting bill,\\" December 15, 2011 The map then went to the House, who approved it 136-61 on December 20, 2011. The House vote was less partisan, with 36 Democrats voting for the redistricting map and 8 Republicans voting against it.SB 1249 - Congressional Redistricting - Voting Record Democrats introduced their own map as an amendment, but the amendment failed. Pennsylvania Democratic Chairman Jim Burn issued a press release, stating, \\"The Republicans have proposed a map far more partisan and gerrymandered than anyone would have guessed, a map that they will now force into law without any public input.\\"North Hills Patch, \\"Redistricting Forces Local Congressman Into Primary Race,\\" December 20, 2011 Corbett signed the new map into law on December 22, 2011.ABC 27, \\"Corbett signs off on new congressional map,\\" December 22, 2011 The map drew Democratic Reps.

On December 29, 2017, a Pennsylvania trial court held that, although the district boundaries had been drawn to favor Republicans, the district lines did not violate state law. The case was appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which reviewed the matter on an expedited basis. In a short order on January 22, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the existing map, saying it \\"clearly, plainly and palpably\\" violated the state constitution. The court promised a full opinion at a later date, and provided a timeframe in which the state legislative and executive branches could prepare new maps if they chose to do so. The order gave the General Assembly until February 9, 2018, to submit a proposed map to the governor, who would have until February 15, 2018 to submit it to the court.\\"Second, should the Pennsylvania General Assembly choose to submit a congressional districting plan that satisfies the requirements of the Pennsylvania Constitution, it shall submit such plan for consideration by the Governor on or before February 9, 2018. If the Governor accepts the General Assembly‚Äôs congressional districting plan, it shall be submitted to this Court on or before February 15, 2018.\\" Pennsylvania Republicans appealed to the United States Supreme Court and tried to halt enforcement of the January 22 order while the appeal was pending. Their request was denied on February 5, 2018.

It has been introduced in other locations, including the San Francisco Delta of the United States. It is raised in fisheries, and is very similar in appearance to the delta smelt (H. transpacificus). Synonyms peppers Hypomesus chishimaensis was described as being a new species in the lakes of Kunashir and Iturup in 1997 based on claimed morphological differences. After later studies failed to find these morphological differences, it regarded as an ecotype of H. nipponensis. A 2007 genetic analysis supported this classification, and recommended that H. chishimaensis not be given its own binomial designation. Introduction to the United States Native to the lakes and estuaries of Hokkaido, Japan and introduced to the lakes on Honshu and Kyushu, the Japanese wakasagi was introduced to California water reservoirs by the California Department of Fish and Game to provide more prey for stocked rainbow trout after failed attempts to introduce native delta smelt to three foothill reservoirs. At the time, the California-native delta smelt and the Japanese smelt were thought to be separated members of the same species, H. olidus. In 1959 the CDFG imported 3.6 million fertilized eggs attached to palm fiber mats from a population in Suwa Lake, located east of Tokyo; many of these eggs were dead on arrival. The fiber mats were placed in streams feeding into six lakes and reservoirs that appeared to be ecologically suitable for the smelt. It was thought at the time that these reservoirs could be chemically treated to eradicate the fish if they were found to be undesirable. In 1972 and 1973 about 77,000 fish from the Shastina Reservoir were moved to the Almanor Reservoir in Plumas County. All attempts to introduce the fish were successful, except the Dodge and Big Bear Reservoir introductions, the latter of which may have been partially attributable to chemical treatments meant to eradicate stunted crappie and goldfish. Progression into delta Although a retrospective analysis of preserved delta smelt samples caught in 1972 and 1982 from the Delta region has shown that wakasagi had been invading the estuaries in undetected quantities since at least the early 1970s, wakasagi expansion from these original introduction sites southward was not tracked until several years later. In 1994 they were detected at the State Water Project pumping plant for the first time, and by 1998 the fish could be found throughout the estuary including the Suisun and San Pablo Bays. Consequences Because the two species are very similar in morphology and life history, the wakasagi presents several potential threats to the endangered delta smelt. Besides direct competition for nutritional resources and the possibility that wakasagi may prey on the eggs and larvae of delta smelt, hybridization could either dilute the species or cause population decline due to sterilizing effects. In fact, a few hybrids have been captured in the wild, although all of them were first generation crosses and no evidence of back-crossing has been found, which would suggest that the hybrids were not viable. Misidentification of the species is an additional concern, which could lead to inaccurate assessments critical to making policy decisions; however this problem may be mitigated if genetic markers are used for identification. In addition to its negative effects on the delta smelt, the wakasagi significantly reduced Kokanee fisheries, but helped increase growth rates of other salmon and trout fisheries.

Kaya died while in police custody (purportedly beaten to death by the police); he was arrested for smoking Marijuana during one of his concerts. Musical career Joseph R√©ginald Topize was born in Roche-Bois in Port Louis on August 10, 1960, from a family of five children. He was left under the supervision of an uncle as his father, a fisherman, was unable to support his education. Topize did not have a very happy childhood. Being a Mauritian Creole, he was a young victim of racism and found himself left on his own to find odd jobs at the age of 8 years. At 16, he began to learn the guitar. He played hits from artists such as Mike Brant, Santana, Deep Purple, etc., and hosted dances and weddings with his first band, \\"Wind and Fire\\". Topize adopted the name 'Kaya' soon after discovering Bob Marley and reggae music in homage to Marley's album of the same name. Kaya revered Marley and was heavily influenced by him both musically and politically. Kaya decided to move away from his former music style covering pop-rock groups and became dedicated to both interpreting the music of Bob Marley. Spotted for his talents as a guitarist, he joined the group 'L√©lou Menwar'. It was with them that Kaya performed in his first real concert and recorded his first studio album 'Letan Lenfer'. After touring with L√©lou Menwar, Kaya gathered some friends from his hometown, Roche-Bois, to create the group 'Racinetatan'; named after a Malagasy prince exiled in Mauritius. Kaya and Racinetatan incorporated many of Marley's hits into their performances along with heavily influenced reggae compositions of their own. However, over time Kaya began to question this with the concept of \\"roots & culture\\" in mind. Kaya began to see that though he loved reggae and Jamaican culture, this did not fit his reality in Mauritius. In 1986, fueled by his new thought process, Kaya began to mix reggae music in with the local music, Sega. Political action Kaya also campaigned for the rights of the Mauritian Creole people. On February 16, 1999, the Republican Movement organised a free concert for the decriminalization of cannabis along Edward VII Street at Rose Hill. Five groups were playing, including Kaya. Rama Valayden, the leader of the Republican Movement later to become Minister of Justice, opened the festivities with a speech in favor of the decriminalization of soft drugs, saying: \\"mo pou am√®ne d√©p√©nalisation, sinon mo pas pou dans gouvernement\\" as reported by the local press. Valayden then asked the crowd for a show of hands in support of resolutions calling for the decriminalization and appealed to Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam for those imprisoned for possession of marijuana to be amnestied. At the time, about 2000 people or 75% of the prison population were imprisoned for soft drugs offenses, with sentences ranging from several months to two years. The event drew approximately 2000 participants and was held in a loving and peaceful atmosphere. Many young people began to smoke marijuana openly and at the time there was no police intervention. Two days after the event, police forces identified five people for smoking or encouraging the smoking of marijuana during the concert and had them reprimanded. Kaya was among those arrested and admitted to smoking the night of the concert. He was immediately imprisoned in \\"Alcatraz\\", at the Line Barracks prison, a detention center in Port-Louis. The police issued a request of 10,000 rupees (a considerable amount for the average Mauritian) for the release of the artist. Kaya's wife, aided by his fellow musicians and members of the MR (not Valayden), managed to raise the bail money. However, due to various blunders of the lawyers involved and especially a lack of political support for the MR, Kaya was not released on the expected date, February 20. Since this then led on to a weekend, his release date would be postponed until the Monday. This was too late for Kaya and he was found dead in his cell on the morning of Sunday, February 21, 1999. The official records state that Kaya, suffering from drug withdrawal, threw himself against the walls of his own cell and broke his skull in the process. A coroner from the neighbouring island of Reunion, Dr. Ramstein, contradicted this statement with his examination which claimed Kaya had been beaten to death. Riots followed soon after causing a major social upheaval in Mauritius resulting in the 1999 Mauritian riots.Vellien, Clifford: Rioting in Mauritius set off by jail death of singer, The Guardian, 25 February 1999.

Early years Draper was born in 1916, the third of six children born to Delbert Morley Draper and Frances Mary Rogers. Shortly after her birth her family relocated to Salt Lake City where she lived until 1934.The bulk of the information in this article taken from DeSantis, Fortunata, with Draper, Margaret: A Brief Biography of Margaret Draper, 1997 (unpublished) She performed in her first play when she was four, when the University of Utah drama department came to Stewart School to find two children ‚Äì Draper and her brother Courtney - to appear in The Hour Glass. Draper attended East High School in Salt Lake City, where she pursued her chosen passion in dramatic, dancing and musical productions. Due to shortened school years and the Great Depression, She entered the University of Utah at age 15. However, due to poor grades, she was sent by her parents to business college for a year, where she learned skills that helped her earn a living when she was later to arrive in New York. She was readmitted to the University the following year, and majored in dramatics, graduating with a respectable average. A 1940 newspaper article noted that she \\"is pleasantly remembered for her performances in Theta Alpha Phi productions\\" at the university. The summer she graduated from university, she was invited to accompany a friend and his sister to New York City in their Ford coupe; despite her older sister‚Äôs impending wedding, she accepted without hesitation, realizing this would be her only chance to pursue a career in the theatre. She departed the following day with a single bag and $38.50 in her purse. Alone in New York, she found a small room in Tudor City, and realized that she soon must find employment, which she secured in G. Schirmer's music store. Career By dint of perseverance and incessant self-promotion, Draper landed her first job with the Provincetown Theater in return for translating a French play. In the late 1930s through 1940, Draper was active in the theater in the Eastern United States for four seasons. She worked with the Wharf School of the Theater, Provincetown, Massachusetts; Green Lake Players, Buffalo, New York; Cherry Lane Theatre, New York City, New York; and Chekhov Theater Studio, Ridgefield, Connecticut. During World War II, she worked for two years for the Red Cross in Europe and the Middle East as a recreational director, and returned to lean years in New York until 1947, when she got her first radio role with Carl Beier in the CBS program, Joe Powers of Oakville. (Another source says: \\"In 1947, she joined with the Barter Theatre and for a year toured with that company throughout the southwest. In March of 1948, she returned to New York and radio ....\\") She later appeared in the Actor's Equity presentation of \\"Peer Gynt\\", and was voted one of the most promising actresses of the year. She obtained supporting roles in two Broadway shows, played the part of Fay Perkins in the radio soap opera Ma Perkins, and in 1949 was invited to audition for the part of Liz Dennis in Brighter Day. She won the part, and played Liz until around 1954, when the part of Linda Pepper was being cast for Pepper Young's Family, which she won. ^ \\"Pepper Young's Wife\\". TV-Radio Mirror. March 1957. pg 86. Draper appeared in The Gambler in New York City in 1952. Her Broadway credits included A Minor Adjustment, during the 1967-1968 season. Family life Margaret Draper married actor Joe De Santis in May 1949, and became the mother of her only child, Christopher, in 1951. The marriage ended in 1957. In 1959, she married Nicol Bissel, an architect. She moved to Mamaroneck, New York, and for a year and a half played the part of housewife and mother. She divorced again, in 1960, and returned to Manhattan, where she worked in various theatrical productions whenever possible, but made her living, in large part, doing TV and radio commercials. In addition to hundreds of individual spots for various products, she acted as the spokesperson for Camel cigarettes, Nescafe, Kraft Foods products, Woolite detergent and others. In 1966, she became a disc jockey for an all-woman FM radio station in New York, WFEM (otherwise known as WNEW-FM) and in 1969, she joined the United Seamen's Service, an organization that provided rest and service clubs for merchant marine sailors around the world. Her first assignment was as the assistant Director of the club in Cam Ranh Bay, Viet Nam. In 1970, the Viet Nam club was closed because of the war, and she was transferred to the club in Naples, Italy as director, where she served until 1972. In 1972, she married J. Norman Messer (CDR USN) who was serving as Executive Officer on the USS Cascade, stationed in Naples. They moved to Key West, Florida, but Margaret was once again divorced in 1973. Subsequently, she lived in Geneva, Switzerland; in Alexandria, Egypt, where she established a club for the United Seamen's Service; and in Washington, D.C., where she worked for the National Alliance of Business as a reference specialist in the PSIP Clearinghouse. Later years & death Draper retired in 1985, in New York City, and began writing an autobiographical novel. She resided for a time in Santa Fe, New Mexico but found that she missed the culture, theater, and activity or New York, as well as her many friends, and returned there. In later life she was married to Wesley Brown and traveled extensively with him until his death after four years. In 2003, Draper moved to an independent living community in Salt Lake City. In the fall of 2010, she moved to her son's home in Payson, Utah, and the following spring she settled in a care facility in that same town, where she died on October 14, 2011, aged 94.

Formed in September 2008, the band comprises Shane Lance (lead vocals, guitar), Emerson Shotwell (drums, percussion), Daniel Collins (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Nick Howard (bass guitar, backing vocals). The Tacoma, Washington newspaper, the Weekly Volcano, noted \\"having been birthed in a recording studio means their sound was born running, and it really shows. They are the most radio-ready band in Tacoma, and to say that you should hurry and see them before they get big is no exaggeration.\\" In the local Seattle music scene, the band quickly became known for their groomed and \\"MTV-ready sound, comparable to chart-topping arena-rockers Coldplay and Kings of Leon\\". History Formation Shane Lance and Emerson Shotwell first met during elementary school. They began playing in bands throughout their junior high and high school days. Nick Howard, a childhood friend of Lance's, later joined the band to play bass. Originally a guitar player, Howard switched to bass. The trio, then nameless, played their first gig at a local coffeehouse, which Daniel Collins attended. After the gig, the coffee shop's manager suggested Collins as a potential lead guitar player to the band. A week later, Collins joined the band and the lineup was complete. During this time, Lance was working at a local recording studio called Pacific Studios. He and studio owner Mark Simmons and Jeff Evans began talking about creating a pop-rock project. Simmons' interest was piqued in the band when they showcased their music for him in the studio. Simmons later took up manager and producer roles in the band. The band finally settled on their name, 'Roman Holiday', which was suggested by Simmons. According to Lance, \\"it was the only name the band didn't hate.\\" At this same time, Nigel Finley, also an employee at Pacific Studios, stepped in as keyboardist for the band. The quintet then began recording their debut EP, released in May 2009. Shortly after the EP's release, Finley left the band for personal reasons. In August 2009, the band began recording for their debut album at Pacific Studios. As the record went into production, the band tested their new sound by going on their first American west coast tour. In January 2010, Roman Holiday locally released Paint This Town, to a sold-out theater. The day after the release show, the band departed for their second, extended American west coast tour. Live According to the live review's section of the Weekly Volcano, \\"The music is good. It drives, it grooves, it occasionally soars. It does the things that a good pop rock band needs to do, and that so many crappy pop rock bands don't get - things with melody and harmony and backing vocals and dynamics.\\" Discography Roman Holiday (EP) Released in May 2009.

Origins Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools (DC-Art) was originally a private venture by R&D; engineer Craig Maier and software engineer Rick Carlson. Developed in the early 1990s, the original concept was conceived in an attempt to preserve the extensive Edison Lateral collection of test pressing recordings held at the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey. DC-Art was developed so that the many test pressings could be transferred to digital tape for preservation and archival purposes. The total number of songs which were recorded with the original software numbered over 1200 in anywhere from two to five takes and included many recordings that had not been played since the late 1920s.http://www.diamondcut.com/store/index.php?main_page=page_4&zenid;=ec08b0a526dafd436e4b7deb813a0fde In 1995, the Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools (DC-Art) program was first formally introduced into the commercial marketplace. Since then DC-Art (or DC for short) has been used throughout the world for not only musical audio restoration applications, but for others such as 911 call restoration, clarification of police surveillance recordings, cleanup of radio broadcasts for release on CD, restoration of historic spoken word recordings, cockpit voice recording restoration among others. The full version is highly useful and flexible for any number of audio related operations.Diamond Cut Live/Forensics Audio Laboratory v.7.5 Users Manual, Thirteenth Edition, 1st Printing Versions Unlike other programs in the field of record and audio restoration, DC-Art has undergone regular and significant modifications on an almost annual basis. Many of the changes appear to stem from the frequent discussions and interest in the process of audio restorationhttp://www.discomusic.com/forums/vinyl-record-care-audio- restoration-mp3/http://www.soundonsound.com/forum/ by addressing them using new and novel algorithms in order to both simplify and improve the outcomes of the audio restoration process. As such, many of the releases include alterations aimed at both novice and experienced/expert users or engineers in the field: DC-Art DC-Art was the first of the officially released audio restoration programs from Diamond Cut Productions in April 1995 and featured a 16-bit processing architecture for the various audio processing algorithms. Initially it was released as a beta version to potential customers and identified as QA 1.1. During the initial release it took several months of de- bugging to optimise the various algorithms. DC-Art V1.0 was made available to the public by July 1996 and later through Tracer Technologies, Inc.http://www.tracertek.com/ in order to facilitate the marketing and distribution of the software. Version 2.0 of DC-Art was released later in December 1997 and included innovative real-time filter previews. If you have an original copy of QA 1.1, consider it a collectable antique! DC-Art-32 DC-Art 32 was released in 1998 and also referred to as \\"DC-Art Version 3.0\\". In contrast to the earlier release, DC-Art 32 used a 32-bit processing architecture to improve the accuracy of the various audio processing algorithms. Unlike other audio-restoration software, DC-Art 32 also introduced a novel enhancement processes termed the Virtual Valve Amplifier (aka. VVA). This novel enhancement algorithm provided the opportunity to re-create or enhance various harmonic frequencies that are otherwise lost during the audio restoration process and to \\"color\\" sound to match that of the era from which the recording was made. DC-Art Millennium DC-Art Millennium/Live or \\"DC- Art Version 4.0\\" was publicly released in August 1999. Unlike previous versions, DC-Art Millennium brought with it a new level of performance and features in the audio restoration and enhancement software market. Unlike other software of its type it included features like live feed through mode whereby a user could effectively restore a recording on the fly. At the time, it was also one of few programs available to the public that supported 24-bit/96 kHz sound files which was later found to facilitate impulse noise detection and FFT based noise removal algorithms. In addition, DC-Art Millennium boasted over 15 real-time tools that could be used individually or in combination (called a multi-filter) and thus setting the restoration software benchmark for its time. In August 2001, DC-Art Live and Millennium were up-dated to version 4.8 with various bug fixes and the addition of a digital high resolution VU meter. Also during this period, changes were made to improve the frequency resolution of the spectrum analyzer. DC- Enhance/MP3 DC-Enhance/MP3 was released in February 2001 as a low cost product for improving the fidelity of MP3 audio files. Unlike other members of the DC-Art family DC-Enhance/MP3 did not include any tools for audio restoration, rather focusing on enhancement of bass and harmonic attributes of already digitised audio. Due to the limited function of this program it was rapidly superseded by other DC-Art versions which included MP3 enhancement as a part of the multifilter component. DC-Audio Mentor As the name suggests, Audio Mentor was designed to take novice users \\"by the hand\\" and guide them through the restoration process of removing clicks, pops, hiss and surface noise from any recording format. In a rather innovative method, Audio Mentor took a user through a series of informative steps from setting the recording levels, noise reduction, sound enhancement to making a CD in minutes. It included facilities to automatically split a file into its individual tracks such as when transcribed from a cassette or LP record. In addition, it simplified the process of tracking audio files undergoing or having undergone the restoration process by automatically transferring them between various folders and included a novel mechanism for keeping track of what had been done on each individual file (e.g. noise reduction, Enhancement, Final Touches). DC-Audio Mentor underwent several months of beta testing before being released in mid July 2006. DC-5 DC-5 beta began development in early 2000. As the result of a substantial number of improvements, testing did not commence until June 2002 before being released in September 2002. Previous versions of DC-Art software used a source vs destination file setup termed \\"Classic edit mode\\" whereby each time a filter was applied to a source file it would generate a new, altered destination file tiled within the same window. Whilst this was commendable for archival purposes, for the home user or intermediate expert it resulted in too many semi-complete restoration files. DC-5 addressed this issue by introducing \\"Fast Edit\\" mode and a new \\"Fast Edit\\" history whereby each change to the original file could be reversed. In this mode, both the source and destination files became the one file on screen, whilst information regarding changes made were saved in the background to enable them to be selectively un-done. Other improvements included VOX recording facilities, timer recording, dithering, 192 kHz sampling rate support and most importantly a \\"Live Feed-through mode\\" was added which enabled a multifilter to perform a record restoration on the fly often required for radio broadcasting. Changes were also made to the functionality of the continuous noise filter whereby new inflexion points could be added to better match the FFT filter curve to that of the sampled noise in order to facilitate its removal without producing digital artifacts. Other improvements were aimed at novice users or reducing the time required to restore recordings made from old shellac records. These included new and simplified EZ DeClick and EZ DeCrackle filters for repairing unwanted impulse noises. Similarly, a weighting function was added to the median filter which had advantages for both de-crackling a recording and facilitating speech clarification by changing the \\"timbre\\" of the sound often required with forensic audio recordings. Other additions included a de-clipping filter and acoustical analysis facilities for spectrograph-voice prints. DC-6 DC-6 Beta testing began May 2004 and was released in late August 2004. This period saw a significant change to how the various software algorithms were being performed and resulted in increased speed of filter processing (reportedly anywhere from 25 to 100% faster). During this period, there were also a number of simplified filter designs added to aid novice users with the basics of record restoration. This included the introduction of an EZClean filter that de-clicked, de-hissed and removed residual hum from a record in one step. Similarly, the Live/Forensic edition saw a number of additional improvements relating to forensics work. This included dual logging of incoming un- processed and out-going processed audio streams, time domain and frequency domain adaptive filter algorithms for separating human voice from significant background noise. It is also possible that DC-6 was the first to boast a new ‚ÄúAuto-continuous noise‚Äù FFT algorithm that would automatically calculate the noise fingerprint of a recording ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù and update it on a continuous basis. Whilst this method was deemed not as effective for removing noise compared to the other traditional techniques, the convenience it provided to novice or time-restricted users and the additional ability to adapt to changing noise environments outweighed the noise reduction performance limitations.Diamond Cut Live/Forensics Audio Laboratory v.6.0 Users Manual AFDF/VVA VST plugin In 2006 several of the audio enhancement tools previously only available in the DC-Art line were trialed and released as VST plugin devices for use in other VST plugin compatible audio software. These plugins included a suite of powerful digital signal processing (DSP) audio tools including the Automatic Frequency Domain Filter (AFDF) as well as the Virtual Valve Amplifier (VVA). These tools were readily welcomed especially the AFDF due to its ability to automatically adapt itself to noisy files and remove large amounts of noise with little intervention from the user. The AFDF filter found its application in situations where voice recordings were obscured by noise and needed to separated from cacophonous environmental sounds in order to make them audible and understandable. This was primarily because it was designed as an ‚ÄúAdaptive‚Äù filter that constantly changed during operation, adjusting itself to the noisy environment. Unlike other filters offered in the DC-Art range, the AFDF is optimized for Forensics recordings and not ‚ÄúHigh Fidelity‚Äù files. As such, it was programmed to exhibit a faster response time and a narrower effective bandwidth while producing higher levels of noise reduction at the expense of potentially producing higher levels of digital artifacts. Applications included recordings collected by law enforcement officials and others responsible for cleaning up poorly recorded evidence in a short time for accurate presentation at trials. DC-7 DC-7 began beta testing in July 2007 and was later released in October 2007. It boasted a significantly different algorithm included into the FFT-based continuous noise filter called \\"Artifact Suppression\\" mode. The new algorithm reportedly reduced the aliasing and artifacting that often accompanies noise reduction with such filters. Of equal significance was the introduction of a simple Virtual Phono Preamp for accurate and simplified equalization of almost any record format. Another milestone was the development and inclusion of an \\"EZ Enhancer\\" filter which simplified the otherwise difficult process of sound enhancement that often follows the noise reduction process. DC-7 also introduced a simple \\"Tune Library\\" which allowed a user to catalogue the progression and restoration of audio files in a database style view. Somewhere along the line it was also decided to include the Spectrogram View previously only found in the DC-Forensics range with the basic audio restoration/Live software version to aid in manual impulse noise removal and other challenging operations. Together, these changes provided very successful and popular in the field of audio restoration tools and was likened to the transition \\"from regular television to High Definition\\". DC7.5 DC-7 was further evolved to DC-7.5 which was released for beta testing in November 2008. It included a number of improvements namely the addition of a narrow crackle filter for smoothing the sound of recordings made on old shellac records. Other modifications included better discrimination of impulse noise filters in the presence of Brass/voice solos and the FFT-based continuous noise filter which was also modified to include a larger range of FFT filter sizes (from 32 to 1600+ frequency bins). Similarly, a number of other restorations were updated and improved before being made available to the public in January 2009. DC-8 DC-8 is the latest of the Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Software releases. DC8 was released for private beta testing in late November 2009. Due to a number of significant changes to the core of the program, rigorous beta testing took several months delaying the final release to March 2010. DC8 included a number of novel and innovative advances including a \\"Big Click Filter\\" for automatically repairing extremely large clicks created by a cracked or badly gouged record. DC8 also introduced the concept of a Direct Spectral Editor tool to provide users with the ability to manually attenuate or interpolate very long-lived noise events on recordings like coughs, whistling, chair movement and other unwanted spurious signals. In addition, the spectral editing tool has other uses in audio restoration including the selective removal of record ‚Äúswoosh‚Äù sounds that are otherwise unable to be removed without significant audio fidelity degradation. The DSE tool has been discontinued in the United States versions, but is available elsewhere throughout the world. Other improvements included changes to the performance of the manual impulse noise interpolator through the use of a combination of time and frequency domain techniques. DC8 also included file support for Broadcast Wave Formats (BWF), Flac, and Ogg Vorbis. The Virtual Phono Preamplifier was also expanded to include 49 additional LP EQ recording curves usable with either RIAA or Flat Preamp front-end hardware. Of the novel additions was the inclusion of the ‚ÄúSub-Harmonic Synthesizer‚Äù and the ‚ÄúOvertone Synthesizer‚Äù. These two filters generate harmonic frequencies to re- create the lost lower and upper octaves of a recording improving the fidelity of a restoration.http://www.diamondcut.com/vforum/showthread.php?t=4268 See also * List of music software References External links * Category:Acoustics software ","title":"Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools"},{"id":"26145777","text":"Leskovec may refer to: In Croatia: *Leskovec (Meƒëimurje County), a village in the Municipality of ≈†trigova In the Czech Republic: *Leskovec nad Moravic√≠, a village in the Moravian-Silesian Region *Leskovec (Vset√≠n District), a village in the Zl√≠n Region In Slovenia: *Leskovec, Celje, a village in the City Municipality of Celje *Leskovec, Ivanƒçna Gorica, a village in the Municipality of Ivanƒçna Gorica *Leskovec, Novo Mesto, a village in the City Municipality of Novo Mesto *Leskovec pri Kr≈°kem, a village in the Municipality of Kr≈°ko In Kosovo * Leskovec, Kosovo, village in Prizren Municipality ","title":"Leskovec"},{"id":"26145781","text":"Morteza Gholi Khan (Sani-ol Douleh) (; 1856‚Äì1911) was a member of the Hedayat family, son of Ali Gholi Khan (Mokhber-ol Douleh), was a key leader of the Persian Constitutional Revolution who then became the first Chairman of the first Majlis (Assembly or House of Representatives).

Retrieved on 8 February 2010. Early history Built in 1866 by Akers Mekaniske Verksted in Christiania in Norway, Ellengowan was originally named N√∏kken. She was built for Mr D. Hegermann. The vessel was long, wide, had a depth of and had a gross register tonnage of 58. She was powered by sail and a vertical direct acting steam engine. Steam was supplied by a round scotch boiler. Hegermann used N√∏kken as a private yacht until it was sold to the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1874. The Reverend Samuel Macfarlane persuaded Miss Baxter, of Dundee, to donate ¬£3,000 for the steamer, renaming it after her own home \\"Ellengowan\\". Macfarlane wanted Ellengowan for missionary work in New Guinea. Departing from Somerset, Cape York Peninsula, the work began with a trip to Anuapata (Port Moresby) in November 1874, to establish the first mission in New Guinea. W. G. Lawes, a missionary with LMS, his wife and the Reverend A.W. Murray travelled on this first trip. Lawes later became the first European missionary to take-up residence in Port Morseby. Macfarlane then organised an expedition to find the mainstream of the Fly River, a major waterway in Western Province, Papua New Guinea, to determine if suitable land was available up-river to establish further missions. Ellengowan steamed for about up a river, but it was not the Fly. Macfarlane named this river the Baxter River (also called Mai-Kassa River), after Miss Baxter. Upon the vessel's return to Somerset, Macfarlane granted leave to James Runcie, captain of Ellengowan, to take Lawrence Hargrave, an Australian inventor and explorer, Octavius Stone and Kendal Broadbent, both naturalists, in another (unsuccessful) attempt to find the mainstream of the Fly River and to cross the Owen Stanley Mountains. A third expedition to find the Fly River was again mounted by Macfarlane on 3 December 1875. He was accompanied by Luigi M D'Albertis, an Italian naturalist and the police magistrate in Somerset, Lieutenant Cherster. On this occasion, the expedition was successful. Ellengowan steamed upstream for , establishing that the Fly was a large and navigable river. As a result, Ellengowan was the first European vessel to sail up the Fly and Baxter rivers. The furthest-most point on the Fly River that the expedition reached, on 14 December 1875, was named Ellengowan Island (7¬∞49'13.66\\"S, 141¬∞40'59.68\\"E)d'Albertis, Luigi Maria (1880, p. 28).

Ellengowan in the Northern Territory The vessel was purchased from LMS in 1881 by the Palmerston Plantation Company, managed by Mr W. Owston, to undertake supply voyages from Palmerston (Darwin) to the Daly River where a sugar plantation had been established. While operating in this role, she struck a sandbar on the Daly River and sank.Searcy, Alfred (1907, p. 137-146). In Australian Tropics. Published by BiblioBazaar, LLC. . Ellengowan remained a shipwreck for four years until she was eventually raised in 1885 by Charles Stuart Copeland, who intended to use the vessel to supply camps along the Roper and McArthur Rivers. The vessel's first trip since being raised was a charter from the government to take a customs officer, Alfred Searcy, in search of Macassan perahu along the Northern Territory coast. However, Ellengowan was so poorly repaired after its stay at the bottom of the Daly River, that upon its return to Port Darwin she was pronounced unseaworthy. Copeland had mortgaged Ellengowan to Herbert H. Adcock and Richard De la Poer Beresford, who then used her as a quarantine hulk for Chinese passengers from Hong Kong to make up the 21 days port before being allowed to land. Being in such poor condition, Ellengowan sank at its mooring off Channel Island, unmanned, during the night of 27 April 1888 and was abandoned. Discovery The Ellengowan shipwreck was discovered in 1991 by local scuba divers following the assistance of historical research conducted by Margaret Clinch.S.S. Ellengowan 1866 - 1888 (1999). NT Government Department of Planning & Environment. Northern Territory Shipwrecks. Published by NTUiprint. The shipwreck's discovery and identity was later verified by archaeologists from the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in 1994, making it the oldest known shipwreck in Darwin Harbour and the only known Norwegian built iron steamer in Australian waters. The shipwreck lies at a depth of approximately , in the channel between Wickham Point and Channel Island, in Darwin Harbour's middle arm.

Wearg held strong Whig and Protestant views. He acted as the counsel for the crown in the prosecutions of Christopher Layer and Bishop Francis Atterbury, and was one of the principal managers for the House of Commons in the trial of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield. In 1722 he contested, without success, the borough of Shaftesbury in Dorset, but was returned for the Whig borough of Helston in Cornwall on 10 March 1724, having been appointed solicitor-general on the previous 1 February. About the same time he was created a knight. He died of a fever on 6 April 1726, and was buried, in accordance with the request in his will, in the Temple churchyard, under a plain raised tomb, on 12 April. Works A volume published in 1723 contained The Replies of Thomas Reeve and Clement Wearg in the House of Lords, 13 May 1723, against the Defence made by the Late Bishop of Rochester and his Counsel. Other attributed works were the subject of controversy at the time. Edmund Curll advertised late in 1726 the publication of six volumes of Cases of Impotence and Divorce, by Sir Clement Wearg, late Solicitor-General. Curll was attacked for this by ‚ÄòA. P.‚Äô in the ‚ÄòLondon Journal‚Äô on 12 November 1726; and two days later swore an affidavit that a book produced by him, and entitled The Case of Impotency as debated in England, Anno 1613, in Trial between Robert, Earl of Essex, and the Lady Frances Howard, 1715, was also by Wearg. It was dated from the Inner Temple, 30 October 1714. Wearg then had chambers in the new court. Family He married Elizabeth, only daughter of Sir James Montagu, chief baron of the exchequer. She died on 9 March 1746, and was buried in the same grave with her husband on 14 March. They had no children.

Life Emmi Pikler was born in 1902 and spent her early childhood in Vienna. She was the only child of a Viennese kindergarten teacher and a Hungarian craftsman. In 1908 her parents moved to Budapest. When Pikler was 12 years old, her mother died. Pikler returned to Vienna to study Medicine, and received her medical degree in 1927. Her pediatric training was at the Vienna University Children's Hospital by Clemens von Pirquet and Pikler studied pediatric surgery under Hans Salzer. Pikler's husband was a mathematician and educator whose experiences aligned with her own perspective on developmental physiology. They decided together with the birth of their first child to allow the child freedom of movement and to await her development patiently, with the goal of promoting her healthy development. Pikler‚Äôs experience with her daughter helped build her perspective that a child must not be stimulated to movement and to games and that every detail in dealing with a child and their environment is important. At first the family lived in Trieste, and later in Budapest. In 1935 Pikler qualified as a pediatrician in Hungary. Pikler wrote and gave lectures about the care and upbringing of infants and young children. She published her first book for parents in 1940 and it went through several editions in Hungary and other countries. The ten years that she worked as a family doctor were difficult. Pikler‚Äôs family was Jewish and her husband was imprisoned for political reasons from 1936 to 1945. With the help of the parents of the children she cared for, Pikler and her family survived the persecution of Jews during World War II. After the war she gave birth to two more children. She did not open her private practice again, but worked for a national association for abandoned and malnourished children. In addition to other activities, she founded the L√≥czy orphanage (named after the street where it was located) in 1946, which she headed until 1979. She sought to establish a comforting atmosphere, including careful selection of the staff, to allow children at the orphanage to grow up without the usual institutional damage. Elsa Gindler and Henry Jacoby found in the 1920s that it was essential to understand the natural path of child development in order to allow the child's initial skills and powers to develop. Gindler and Jacoby explained that traditional infant and early childhood education damaged the initiative of children and stunted their development. In 1946 Pikler founded the L√≥czy Institute in Budapest. Under her leadership, and by the publication of books and scientific publications, an internationally known institution developed that is now managed by Pikler's daughter, child psychologist Anna Tardos. After Pikler retired in 1978, she continued her scientific and consultative work in L√≥czy. In 1984 Pikler died after a short but severe illness. Pikler's methods of raising infants and young children have been popularized in the United States by her student Magda Gerber. Books * La√üt mir Zeit.

The 3rd brigade was posted at Habbaniya and the 2nd and 4th brigades were posted in or around Fallujah.

Geography The church in 2008 Golema Rakovitsa is situated near the eastern end of the Sofia Valley, at the western foot of Sredna Gora mountain. It is located just where the Lopushina and Ravna rivers flow together to form the Lesnovo River. From the village border starts the upper part of Ognyanovo Reservoir. Elin Pelin, the main town of the municipality, is about to the west. An annual from the Bulgarian National Library, published in 1928, indicates that in the middle of 19th century there were 180 houses in the village. It was the biggest settlement in the eastern Sofia district at the time. In comparison, Elin Pelin, named Novoseltsi back then, was listed as having 125 houses. Just after the First World War there were 2,200 residents in the village. However, when the communist regime took the rule in the country, private property was strongly limited and the farming realties were nationalized. The population started permanently decreasing because of migration, mostly to Sofia. Nowadays about 400 people remain in Golema Rakovitsa. History and culture The village was set on fire twice during the 19th century by Ottoman troops. The native Gato Shishkov was among the followers of the revolutionary Vasil Levski who visited the village several times. It was reported that another Bulgarian revolutionary, Georgi Benkovski, also passed through the village. During the Balkan Wars in 1912 a man from Rakovitsa was a member of the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps. The majority of the inhabitants are Christians adhering to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. In the village there is a church named after St Nicholas built in 1857. In the church yard are the remains of an old religious school which was restored in 2005 and turned into a museum. The two-storied building of the modern school was constructed in 1923-1924. It was a comprehensive school named after the Saints Cyril and Methodius. After operating for more than 60 years, the school was closed down in 1994 and the building was abandoned. Every year on 2 May, there is a local village celebration called Sabor, dedicated to the April Uprising.

Bazar Darra was of both strategic and economic importance. It was located at the junction of the route via the Shimshal Valley to Hunza or south over the Mustagh Pass to Skardu, or west to Shahidulla, and was the centre for a number of goldmines. It also joined the main winter route which led directly north along the frozen Yarkand River to Yecheng via Kokyar, and from there, the route went northwest via Kokyar to Yarkand (Yarkant County) and Kashgar, or northeast to Pishan Town and Hotan,Hill (2009), p. 207Filippi (1924), pp. 471-493; 472.

The headquarters of the Iraqi Ground Forces Command and the Iraqi Joint Forces Command are the same entity. Since 2006, and probably up to U.S. withdrawal in 2011, the Ground Forces Command has supervised the bulk of the military units of the army.  History  From 2003 until 2006, the units of the reforming Iraqi Army were under U.S. Army operational control. Their formation had been managed by the Coalition Military Assistance Training Team, which then became part of Multi- National Security Transition Command ‚Äì Iraq. After they became operational, they had been transferred to the operational control of Multi-National Corps Iraq or one of its subordinate formations. On May 3, 2006 a significant command-and-control development took place. The Iraqi Army command and control center opened in a ceremony at the IFGC headquarters at Camp Victory. The IGFC was established to exercise command and control of assigned Iraqi Army forces and, upon assuming Operational Control, to plan and direct operations to defeat the Iraqi insurgency. At the time, the IFGC was commanded by Lt. Gen. Abdul-Qadar. The JHQ-AST (Joint Headquarters Advisory Support Team) had been established in 2004 to guide the IGFC/IJFHQ through this process. The JHQ-AST was a subordinate element of MNSTC-I. The Advisory Support Team's mission was described as to 'mentor and assist the Iraqi Joint Headquarters in order to become capable of exercising effective national command and control of the Iraqi Armed Forces, contributing to the capability development process, and contributing to improving the internal security situation within Iraq in partnership with coalition forces.'Anthony Cordesman and Patrick Baetjer, 'Iraqi Security Forces: A Strategy for Success,' Praeger Security International, Westport, Conn., 2006, p.93 In 2006 the ten planned divisions began to be certified and assume battlespace responsibility: the 6th and 8th before June 26, 2006, the 9th on June 26, 2006, the 5th on July 3, 2006, the 4th on August 8, 2006, and the 2nd on December 21, 2006. After divisions were certified, they began to be transferred from U.S. operational control to Iraqi control of the IGFC. On 7 September 2006, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki signed a document taking control of Iraq's small naval and air forces and the 8th Division of the Iraqi Army, based in the south. At a ceremony marking the occasion, Gen. George Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq stated \\"From today forward, the Iraqi military responsibilities will be increasingly conceived and led by Iraqis.\\" Previously, the U.S.-led Multi-National Force Iraq, commanded by Casey, gave orders to the Iraqi armed forces through a joint American-Iraqi headquarters and chain of command. Senior U.S. and coalition officers controlled army divisions but smaller units were commanded by Iraqi officers. After the handover, the chain of command flows directly from the prime minister in his role as Iraqi commander in chief, through his Defense Ministry to an Iraqi military headquarters, the Iraqi Joint Forces Command. From there, the orders go to Iraqi units on the ground. The other nine Iraqi divisions remain under U.S. command, with authority gradually being transferred. U.S. military officials said there was no specific timetable for the transition. U.S. military spokesman Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said it would be up to al-Maliki to decide \\"how rapidly he wants to move along with assuming control. ... They can move as rapidly thereafter as they want. I know, conceptually, they've talked about perhaps two divisions a month.\\" After the 8th Division's transfer on September 7, 2006, the 3rd Division was transferred on December 1, 2006. Another unspecified division also was transferred to IGFC control. Also transferred to the Iraqi chain of command were smaller logistics units: on November 1, 2006, the 5th Motor Transport Regiment (MTR) was the fifth of nine MTRs to be transferred to the Iraqi Army divisions. 2007 plans included, MNF-I said, great efforts to make the Iraqi Army able to sustain itself logistically.MTRs transferred in order of event: 8th, 4th, 6th, 5th and 1st (2 Nov). IA 5th MTR driving toward success - Daily article on www.mnf-iraq.com, 20 November 2006. Transfers of divisions to IGFC control continued in 2007: the 1st Division on February 15, the 10th Division on February 23, and the 7th Division on November 1. The new 14th Division also held its opening ceremony in Basrah on November 14, 2007. Ministerial Order #151, dated 19 February 2008, directed that the brigades of all the divisions be renumbered sequentially.

The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur, switching the chain from cog to cog. An electronic system can switch gears faster, and because the system does not use Bowden cables and can calibrate itself, it may require less maintenance. History In 1990 the Japanese bike component manufacturer SunTour introduced the Browning Electronic AccuShift Transmission (SunTour BEAST) - a triple chainset system for mountain bikes in which one quarter of the circle is hinged along a radius. During shifting, this segment is pushed sideways by a relay operated mechanism like a railroad switch and picks up the chain that is currently running on the next cog. In 1992 the French manufacturer Mavic introduced their first electronically controlled gear shift mechanism called Zap at the 1992 Tour de France. It was a prototype, but it achieved neither technical success nor commercial application. A development of this was used by Chris Boardman to win the opening time trial (prologue) of the 1997 Tour de France. In 1994 Sachs introduced the Speedtronic. In 1999 Mavic introduced the Mektronic, its second electronic shift system, which suffered from reliability issues and was subsequently discontinued. In 2001 Shimano introduced a set of trekking components called Di2 (Digital Integrated Intelligence), which included electronic shifting and automatic adaption of front and rear suspension to riding speed. During the 2000s both Shimano and Campagnolo (2005) experimented with electronic shifting in professional cycle races. The first commercially successful electronic gear shift system for road bicycles was introduced by Shimano in 2009, the Di2. Three professional teams used the Di2 in the 2009 Tour of California: Columbia High Road, Garmin Slipstream, and Rabobank; and several teams and riders, including George Hincapie, used it during the 2009 Tour de France Also in 2009 Giant released a bicycle equipped with the Shimano Di2 and Trek began providing a battery mount and Di2-specific cable routing and stops on its Madone frames. Production SRAM RED eTap rear derailleur installed on bike.In 2015 SRAM announced its wireless electronic groupset called, SRAM RED eTap. The group was released in Spring of 2016 and is available on complete bikes and through aftermarket SRAM component dealers. (See below)https://sramroadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en- us/articles/206573428-When-is-SRAM-RED-eTap-available- https://sramroadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206573508-Where-is-SRAM- RED-eTap-available- A wireless system that can be retrofitted onto any bicycle was announced in 2016. The front and rear derailleurs remain place, while a wireless gear-change controller is added to the handlebar, with configuration of the system via an iOS/Android app, and customization can be added to the button controllers via the Bluetooth app.  Implementation  As of 2009, one system was commercially available from a major parts manufacturer: Shimano's Di2 (Dura-Ace 7970) for road bicycles. While the traditional method of gear shifting uses mechanical control levers that pull and release Bowden cables and spring-loaded derailleurs, Di2 is controlled by electronic switches located either in the integrated shift levers and/or at the end of time trial bars. The switches send signals through a wiring harness to a battery pack, placed near the bottom bracket. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack supplies power to the derailleur motors, which move the derailleurs via worm gears. Shimano estimates that their 7.4-volt battery pack can last up to per charge. The system also has an LED light to warn when it needs a charge. The rear derailleur has shift times similar to mechanical systems and a break-away system to protect it in case of a crash. The front derailleur, however, switches gears almost 30% faster than Dura-Ace‚Äôs mechanical counterpart. On traditional bikes, the front derailleur is problematic because the chain can be under tension and has to make a large vertical jump between chainrings. The electronic system's controlled motion overcomes these problems. The Di2 can also trim the front derailleur to eliminate chain rub and calibrate itself to adjust for wear and tear. Finally, the entire 7970 groupset weighs approximately less than the 7800 it replaces but more than the new 7900. In 2011 Shimano introduced the Ultegra Di2 electronic gear change set, a cheaper version of the electronic Dura-Ace system. This set seemed to provide an electronic option within reach of a wider audience. Campagnolo introduced their first system of electronic shifting, EPS, in the same year. By 2012 Campagnolo had three electronic shifting groupsets available. Cyclists began to see a growing range of electronic alternatives to traditional mechanical shifting for derailleur gears. Wireless shifting A wireless system was announced by Tiso in 2012, but this did not achieve widespread use. SRAM RED eTap HRD brake leverIn August 2015 SRAM Corporation announced its wireless shifting system, eTap. The system had been extensively developed and secretly tested over several years from initial design to a stage win in the 2015 Tour de France. The front and rear derailleurs use direct-mount batteries and communicate wirelessly with the shifters through a proprietary wireless protocol developed by SRAM called, Airea (pronounced: area). A set of small satellite shifter buttons, called Blips, can be connected to the shift levers or aero shift module (BlipBox) and placed anywhere along the handlebars as part of the system. A maximum of four Blips can be used per bike. The company also took the opportunity to introduce a new shifting convention with this system. The right lever shifts the rear derailleur outboard, the left lever shifts the rear derailleur inboard, and pressing both levers together shifts the front derailleur. SRAM made the groupset available for purchase on complete bikes and as aftermarket components sold through dealers from Spring 2016. Eventually, extension of the system is expected to the company's lower group sets, such as SRAM Force. In May 2016 the company announced a hydraulic disc brake version of its wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both lever reach adjustment and lever contact point adjustment, a first for road disc brakes.SRAM RED eTap HRD caliper and rotor installed on bike. At Eurobike 2015 Held in Friedrichshafen, Germany, the FSA company displayed their working prototype of a wireless gear shifting system. The system was trialled at the 2016 Tour de France in stage 17, and at Eurobike 2016 the final form of the WE (Wireless Electron) groupset (which includes wireless shifting) was displayed. FSA plans to make this available from May 2017. At Interbike 2016, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Paul Gallagher displayed a working prototype of his XSHIFTER universal wireless gear shifting system. It is a patent pending device that is claimed to convert any bike with mechanical derailleurs to wireless smart shifting in a few minutes. The XSHIFTER will be seeking funding for development in November 2016. If successful, this project will further extend the range of electronic gear-shifting systems. Archer Components, a California based company, sells a wireless shifting retrofit kit for mountain bikes. The first version of the product was released on February 9th, 2018 and called the D1x Electronic Shifter. A subsequent version of the product was released one year later and called the D1x Trail. The D1x Trail uses a linear servo to pull up to 46mm of standard shift cable using a programmable servo controller. The shifter can be programmed to shift any number of gears from 2 to 20. The shifter connects to the handlebar mounted remote using Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 and is programmed using an iOS or Android app.  Advantages  An electronic system can have several advantages over a comparable mechanical system: * eliminate the need for the rider to switch hand positions in order to shift * allow for an accurate and effortless shift, even in difficult circumstances, such as if the rider has cold hands or is completely exhausted * shifting performance is not affected by contaminated, stretched, or worn Bowden cables * automatic trim function can eliminate chain rub * shifts can be timed to occur at a particular point in the cassette or chainring rotation, making best and smoothest use of ramps and cutouts in the sprocket teeth * the front and rear shift pattern on a bike with multiple chainrings can be programmed to make best use of the gear progression, avoid duplicate ratios and relieve the rider of the need to decide what combination of front and rear sprockets to employ * the smoothness of electronics can reduce the shock on drivetrain components  Disadvantages  An electronic system may have some disadvantages when compared to a mechanical system: * There is currently no option for manual override when the battery is exhausted. This could pose a problem for riders, depending on the type of terrain on which they are riding. However, SRAM's RED eTap groupset's interchangeable derailleur batteries makes it possible to manually switch batteries between the two derailleurs in order to place the battery with remaining charge onto the derailleur the user intends to shift. * Reliability issues have caused previous electronic systems to be withdrawn from the market. As of recently, all electronic group sets are fully waterproof. External connectors are completely waterproof, but internal connectors (internal routing for wired systems) need to be shrink wrapped with shrink tubing to be waterproof. * Cost: The system is expensive compared to lower end mechanical derailleur systems. (The Shimano Dura Ace Di2 system costs in excess of $2500 in May, 2010). * Weight: Electronic groupsets are typically heavier than their mechanical counterparts.

Directed by Thomas H. Ince and produced by the New York Motion Picture Company, the screenplay was written by C. Gardner Sullivan. Although contemporary sources list Thomas Ince as the director, modern sources give directorial credit to Scott Sidney. One of the early five-reel feature length silent movies,\\"Louise Glaum.\\" Los Angeles Herald. Nov. 13, 1919. The Toast of Death was filmed at Inceville Studio in Topanga Canyon near the Pacific Ocean. The film marked Glaum's first role as a \\"vamp\\" and her first starring role in the new features of the day. Plot Mademoiselle Poppea (played by Glaum) is the leading ballerina of the Imperial Ballet in Calcutta, India. Her beauty and charm bring to her many admirers, among them a British soldier, Captain Drake (played by Keenan), and an Indian prince, Yar Khan (played by Mayall), of the Bengalese Dragoons. Although she loves Drake, Poppea agrees to marry the prince because of his title, wealth and high social standing. She keeps Drake as her lover, however, and he visits her regularly at the palace. When the prince is ordered to transfer, he and Poppea go to live in the South. She finds the climate and culture repulsive and is bored and disgusted with her devoted husband. She then writes to Drake and begs him to come see her. Feigning illness, he takes leave from his military duties and travels to Poppea. The prince is pleased to see Drake and receives him warmly. By accident, he discovers the adulterous relationship between Drake and his wife. As revenge, he pours two glasses of wine and puts arsenic into one. He then tells Poppea to select which glass each man will drink. Unknowingly, she selects the poisoned glass for Drake. After the toast, the prince watches as Drake has a horrible death. He disposes of Drake's body and forces his devastated wife, Poppea, to flee out into the desert. Cast *Louise Glaum as Mlle. Poppea *Harry Keenan as Capt. Drake *Herschel Mayall as Yar Khan *J.

Lewis Milestone began directing the film in April 1944, but was stricken with appendicitis in May 1944 and collapsed on the set. John Brahm then stepped in to direct.. Plot Martha Proctor believes something evil has come to her home. Her nephew Dr. Dan Proctor arrives with his betrothed, Evelyn Heath, who is a frail invalid. Evelyn is introduced to Aunt Martha as well as Dan's older brother, Douglas, an illustrator, along with Douglas's wife Ann and his model, Miriam. The women sympathize with Evelyn, knowing of the hard life she has had. Evelyn has bouts of hysteria, involving her fear of birds, and also keeps a secret diary in which she mocks her fianc√© Dan and expresses a desire for Douglas instead. While plotting to seduce Douglas, and accusing Dan of jealousy to make him leave, Evelyn next sets out to rid the house of Miriam, whom she sees as a rival. Her gossip succeeds in getting back to Aunt Martha and turning everyone's suspicions to Miriam, who departs. Douglas then quarrels with Ann, driven apart by Evelyn's diabolical schemes. Evelyn goes so far as to destroy the goodbye note Ann has written to him. By the time everyone realizes who's behind all this and decide to commit Evelyn to an asylum, a hysterical Evelyn flees from the house, screaming, and plunges to her death.

The fault is as much in the story as it is in the handling by all concerned, for the story is cheaply synthetic and about as logical as a crooner's song...Nor is any help rendered by Anne Baxter, who plays the wrecker with so much coyness that anyone, shy of a blind man, could see that she was up to tricks. And Ralph Bellamy is equally ridiculous as a middle-aged Byronic beau who tries to be boyish and amorous and also solemn and wise. Miss MacMahon remains in the background, which is a happy place for one in this film, while Ruth Warrick, Scott McKay and Jerome Cowan get entwined with the torturings up front. Mr. Stromberg is an eminent producer, but his grip certainly slipped on this job.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, February 16, 1945. Last accessed: February 9, 2010.

White achieved notoriety when, as Queensland state leader of the Liberal Party he terminated the longstanding coalition agreement between the Liberal Party and the National Party of Joh Bjelke-Petersen. In the ensuing election, the Liberals were badly defeated, and White was replaced as party leader. After leaving politics, he established a nationwide chain of pharmacies using a franchise model and became a widely respected businessman. In 2012, White was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards. Early life White was born in 1936, and received his initial education at the Sisters of Mercy convent in Sandgate, and St. Columban's at Albion. White showed ambition from a young age, attempting to enrol himself at Nudgee College without telling his parents so that he could receive a good education. White's working-class family were unable at first to pay the fees demanded by the school, but eventually White's mechanic father Bill came to an arrangement with the school to waive Terry's fees in exchange for maintaining the college vehicles for free and for providing buses to transport the students to nearby suburbs for sporting events, when required. After high school, White decided on the recommendation of a friend to study pharmacy. White endured 73 interviews with master pharmacists to find a position as an apprentice, before finally receiving a position at a pharmacy in Scarborough. After graduating as a pharmacist in his own right, White purchased a pharmacy at Woody Point in 1958. He later headed overseas, and got his first taste of politics when he worked on the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. Upon his return to Australia, he joined the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party of Australia. Political career Early career White was first elected to parliament on 1 September 1979, at a by-election for the seat of Redcliffe following the retirement of incumbent National Party member Jim Houghton. A small-l liberal, White was not at home with the conservative bent of the National-led government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen, even though he was technically a government backbencher. He advocated seeking senior status for the Liberals in the coalition with the National Party in order to ensure what he described as \\"responsible democratic government\\". In Queensland, the Nationals were traditionally the dominant partner in the non-Labor coalition, a reverse of the situation in the rest of Australia. White fell in with a group of MPs known as the \\"ginger group\\". This group disagreed with Bjelke-Petersen and Liberal leader Llewellyn Edwards on a number of issues, including the system of electoral malapportionment in use within Queensland at the time, reducing the power of the National Party in the cabinet, and removing the controversial street march laws in place at the time. Despite many of these views being in opposition to Edwards' views and government policy, White was appointed as the minister for Welfare Services in December 1980, just fifteen months after entering parliament. Minister Despite his appointment to cabinet, White continued to have frequent differences of opinion with Edwards. Matters came to a head on 4 August 1983, when Liberal MLA Ian Prentice moved a motion to bring forward debate on the establishment of a public accounts committee to monitor government spending. While this had been approved by a resolution at a Liberal party convention, it was bitterly opposed by Bjelke-Petersen and Edwards was not keen to have it debated, for fear of destabilising the coalition. A division was called, and White and the rest of the \\"ginger group\\" crossed the floor to vote with the Labor opposition in favour of the motion. White argued that the principle of cabinet solidarity, which would normally compel him to vote against the motion, did not apply in this case because there was no official government policy on the matter. This explanation did not sit well with Edwards, who promptly sacked White as Welfare Minister, with Bjelke-Petersen's vocal and public support. In response, White called a spill motion in the partyroom to declare the party leadership open. Edwards was unable to defeat this motion, and declined to renominate for the party leadership. White was elected his successor. Leader of the Liberal Party Immediately after the spill, White and his new deputy, fellow \\"ginger group\\" member Angus Innes, made their way to Bjelke-Petersen's office in the Executive Building to inform him of the new leadership arrangements within the Liberal Party, as well as the need to revise the coalition agreement. Bjelke- Petersen kept the pair waiting outside his office for an hour, in full view of the media, while working on a way to bypass White and the Liberal Party altogether. Bjelke-Petersen had previously stated that he would not work with Innes, and when he finally admitted White and Innes to his office, he informed them that he would not be appointing White as the deputy premier, as was customary under the existing coalition arrangement. In response, White pulled the Liberals out of the Coalition, leaving Bjelke-Petersen seven seats short of a majority. He tore up a copy of the press release issued by Bjelke- Petersen explaining his actions, a move that was interpreted by the media at the time as White symbolically tearing up long-standing coalition agreement. White then led the Liberal MLAs to the crossbench. However, he never actually had the opportunity to lead the Liberals on the floor of the legislature, because Bjelke-Petersen had some days earlier convinced the governor to indefinitely adjourn Parliament. Bjelke-Petersen was therefore able to govern for the nine weeks until the 1983 election, free from parliamentary scrutiny and the threat of a no confidence motion. At the election, Bjelke-Petersen targeted his campaign mainly at right-leaning Liberal voters. He suggested that under White, the Liberals might throw their support behind Labor. The Nationals scored a resounding victory, winning 41 seats in the 82-member parliament, one short of a majority. The Liberals lost 14 seats, leaving them with only eight MLAs. Of the 18 seats that were contested by both a National and a Liberal, the Nationals out-polled the Liberals in 15, and of the \\"ginger group\\", only White and Innes retained their seats. They faced the prospect of further blows when Bjelke-Petersen openly invited Liberal MLAs to defect to the Nationals. Two Liberals, Don Lane and Brian Austin, took up his offer, giving the Nationals an outright majority and leaving only six remaining Liberals. At the time, White remarked that \\"The scent of ministerial leather is a powerful aphrodisiac.\\" That spelled the end of White's leadership, and William Knox was elected to lead the remnants of the party on 3 November. White's term as leader of the Liberal Party had lasted less than three months. White remained in parliament as a Liberal backbencher. He remained a popular MP ‚Äì for instance, at the 1986 election he swept every booth in his seat. He managed to stay out of the limelight until the Fitzgerald Inquiry. During 1988, he was subjected to numerous depositions about discussions that took place during his time in cabinet. While he was ultimately cleared of wrongdoing, the numerous lawyers and accountants he had to employ ate into his parliamentary salary and nearly brought down his pharmacy business. At the 1989 state election, White was defeated in the massive Labor wave that swept through Queensland. Business career After leaving parliament, White concentrated once more on his business career, encouraged by his wife Rhonda. He sold his first franchise in 1994, and by 2010 there were over 150 \\"Terry White Chemists\\" outlets across the country, the majority of which are owned and operated by franchisees. White has also served as President of the Pharmacy Guild, and was involved in the founding of the Australian Institute of Pharmacy Management. In 2012, Terry White was appointed Board Chairman of Metro South Hospital and Health Service (HHS), a government statutory body responsible for the management of five public hospitals, as well as a range of other healthcare facilities across the southside of Brisbane. Terry White was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2011, for his significant contribution to the advancement of the pharmacy profession (Terry White Chemists) and to his community.

He started writing in his early sixties: his first and best-known book, Per violino solo (For Solo Violin), appeared in 1995. In addition to his autobiographical writing, Zargani contributes to discussions about the politics and culture of Italian Jews with essays, lectures and school visits. Biography Aldo Zargani was born in Turin in 1933. In the second half of 1938, when he was five years old, the Fascist regime passed a series of anti-Semitic laws which affected the lives of every one of the approximately 46,000 Jews who lived in Italy at the time. Jews were prohibited from studying or teaching in state and private schools, forbidden to marry non-Jews, expelled from the Fascist Party and excluded from the public administration, from telephone directories and from obituary columns. Zargani's father Mario, a viola player in the national radio orchestra, was dismissed from his job, and Aldo and his brother started attending an ad hoc school set up by the Turin Jewish community. After Northern and Central Italy were occupied by German troops following the armistice between Italy and the Allies on 8 September 1943, the SS and the Gestapo began to round up Jews in every community. Zargani's parents were arrested but were able to avoid deportation, unlike some other members of their families. Aldo and his brother spent a year in hiding in a Catholic boarding school. After World War II had ended, Zargani continued to live in Turin and worked as an actor in two theatre companies; he met his wife, Elena Magoja, a theatre and film actress, at this time. His principal employer was the Italian state radio and television corporation RAI, first in Turin and then in Rome. He retired in 1994. He has a daughter, Lina, and a grandson, Mario, for whom he wrote Per violino solo. Zargani's political allegiance is with the Italian Left. He was a long-time member of a left-wing faction of the Italian Socialist Party and is now an active member of the Gruppo Martin Buber ‚Äì Ebrei per la pace (Jews for Peace) which recognizes the right of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples to independent and sovereign national states. Most of his essays focus on relations between Jews and non-Jews in Italy or political and historical uses of Holocaust memory.1 Works * Per violino solo.

It has won three Italian awards (Ischia International Journalism Award, Premio Acqui Storia, Premio Sant'Anna di Stazzema) and was shortlisted for four prestigious literary prizes (Premio Viareggio, Premio Pisa, Premio Lucca and Pen Club Award). Per violino solo and Certe promesse d'amore (Some Promises of Love) are autobiographical texts. The former traces the narrated self's childhood between 1938 and 1945, against the background of war, civil war, and the Shoah. In the latter the narrated self, a teenager, is drawn to Marxism and left-wing Zionism, discovers love, and gradually sheds a number of personal and political illusions. In both texts the narratives are arranged in a loose chronological sequence, but within each chapter there are numerous flashbacks and \\"flashforwards\\" triggered by associations. The memory of the elderly narrating self intersects with the perspectives of the child and adolescent narrated selves, correcting and evaluating them with help of hindsight. In bilico is a collection of twenty autobiographical narratives and vignettes, set at various times in Zargani's life, where he touches on the contradictions and multiple nature of Jewish history and identity. In all of Zargani's narratives humour and irony play a central role. Their function is both intellectual and ethical. They highlight the tension between Jews as \\"insiders\\" and Jews as \\"outsiders\\", emphasize personal, cultural and political contradictions, and problematize monolithic notions of \\"identity\\". \\"Over time,\\" he states in the concluding pages of Per violino solo, \\"it seems that only humor and religion survive, while memories fade with the life of the person who carried them.\\" References *1.

Background and origin Eyre was a descendant of John Eyre, who had settled in County Galway in the 1650s and established a dynasty under the Protestant Ascendancy. Stratford was the son of Samuel Eyre (Governor of Galway in 1715) and Anne n√©e Stratford. He was appointed High Sheriff of County Galway for 1731. He served as a Colonel at Battle of Culloden in 1746. Governor of Galway He was appointed Governor of the town in 1747. Froude described the then state of the town: > He found himself set to defend a town of which the walls had not been > repaired for a quarter of a century; the castle in ruins; the very name of > military authority forgotten. By law no Catholics ought to have been in > Galway at all. There were thirty Catholics there to one Protestant, and the > Protestant was becoming Protestant but in name. There were 180 > ecclesiastics, Jesuits friars, and seculars. Robert Martin, owner of half > Connemara, resided within the liberties, and was making a fortune by > smuggling there. He was described by Eyre as 'able to bring to the town of > Galway in twenty four hours 800 villains as desperate and as absolutely at > his devotion as Cameron of Lochiel'. The Mayor and Corporation, the fee- > simple of whose property did not amount to 1000 received the tolls and > customs duties. By their charter they were bound in return to maintain the > fortifications. Being what they were, they preferred to divide the town > revenue amongst themselves. The mayor, an O'Hara, was the son of Lord > Tyrawley's footman; the sheriff was a beggar; of the aldermen one was a poor > shoemaker, the other a broken dragoon. Eyre re-established discipline in the garrison, closed the gaps in the town walls and ordered the gate closed at sunset. Unused to such high-handedness, the Corporation sent a furious letter of complaint to Government, signed by the members a majority of the citizens. In response to this, Governor Eyre sent for the members and said to them: > Gentlemen since you are here in your corporate capacity, I must recommend > you to disperse these restless Popish ecclesiastics. Let me not meet them in > every corner of the streets when I walk as I have done. No sham searches, > Mr. Sheriff, as to my knowledge you lately made. Your birds were flown, but > they left you cakes and wine to entertain yourselves withal. I shall send > you, Mr. Mayor a list of some insolent unregistered priests, who absolutely > refused me to quarter my soldiers, and to my surprise you have billeted none > on them. These and James Fitzgerald, who is also an unregistered priest, and > had the insolence to solicit votes for his brother upon a prospect of a > vacancy in Parliament, I expect you'll please to tender the oaths to, and > proceed against on the Galway and Limerick Act. Let us unite together in > keeping those turbulent disqualified townsmen in a due subjection. Lastly, > gentlemen, I put you in mind of the condition on which tolls and customs are > granted to you. Repair the breaches in these walls and repair your streets. Opposition Eyre's policy was supported by the government, but opposed by the Corporation of Galway, the Prime Sergeant, the Protestant Bishop of Elphin, and Francis II de Bermingham, Lord Athenry. He was threatened with assassination as would appear from the following anonymous letter which he enclosed with his correspondence to Secretary Wayte, 11 December 1747:- > Sir, as I had not the pleasure of seeing you since you came to your > government of Galway, I hope soon to see you in the Elysian fields, as I am > just going off the stage. And I am sure, if you don't leave that town, > you'll lose your life before the 10th of next month. 'Tis all your own > fault, for you could not bear the employment which you got, not for your > bravery, but for the slaughter you committed on poor people after Culloden > fight. You'll be served as Lord Lovat's agent was. God be merciful to your > soul. Much of the dissent centred on Robert Martin of Dangan, the leader of the Connacht Jacobites and a leading Freemason. Thady Brennan, Martin's servant, walked past the sentinel at the bridge carrying a gun and pistol, apparently for repair. The boy being a Catholic was disarmed, but Eyre returned the weapons to Martin with a message that if he was sending arms into the town he had better in future send them by persons qualified to carry such things. On Martin refusing to receive back his property, Eyre confiscated the weapons. The assizes coming on Martin served a summons on Eyre to appear before the judges and answer to a charge of larceny. Enclosing the following document to Secretary Wayte, Eyre wrote, \\"If the law was to be thus openly insulted, government would become impossible and neither the Property Act nor any other act, could be enforced in any part of Ireland.\\" Eyre travelled to London on business, where he was followed and struck by Robert Martin. The two engaged in a lengthy sword-duel, with Martin emerging the winner. The two would remain antagonists, as Martin continued to recruit for Jacobite regiments in France, and is believed to have harboured Bonnie Prince Charlie on an incognito visit to Ireland in 1753. Froude described Eyre as \\"a man full of violent personal and religious animosities, intolerant of opposition, and much more fit of the command of a regiment than for the difficult task of governing a Catholic town.\\" His descendants continued to live in the county into the late 19th century.

It was based on the 1942 novel by W. Somerset Maugham. Plot In 1923 in England, General Hetherton is instructing his grandson Jim to shoot a rifle. Jim's dog runs in the way and Jim accidentally kills him. The incident affects him deeply and he becomes a pacifist. Years later, at the commencement of World War II, Jim is headmaster at a school and has fallen in love with a young Austrian woman, Dora Bruckman, who works for his sister-in-law, May. He is unaware that Dora is a Nazi spy. She meets regularly with her supervisors in London, Mrs. M√ºller and Kurt van der Breughel, who are posing as Austrian refugees. Jim's brother Roger joins the Royal Air Force, but Jim applies for exemption from fighting. This is granted. Dora is ordered to provide German bombers with a bearing to a camouflaged airfield using the headlights of May's car. She is caught in the act by May's son Tommy, but claims May must have left the lights on. Dora has to turn them off before the bombers arrive, so the airfield is saved. Jim and Dora marry to save her from being removed from the district. Kurt plans to use Jim in an effort to convince influential English people to consider capitulation. He sends a fake letter to Jim, asking him to join an effort to educate refugee children, a task Jim is eager to accept. When they meet, Kurt suggests to Jim that the Germans might consider negotiating terms for peace with Britain. Jim tells Dora afterwards that Kurt spoke more like a German than a Dutchman. Worried, Dora telephones van der Breughel and recommends bombing the airfield that night. She pours gasoline over a hay wagon. Tommy shows up unexpectedly and, undetected, sees what she is doing. She locks him in a room, but when he blurts out that he knows what she is up to, she pulls out a pistol. Just then, she hears the bombers approaching and rushes out to set fire to the hay. While Roger gets confirmation that Dora is a saboteur, Tommy escapes, encounters Jim, and tells him of his wife's betrayal. When Jim arrives home, Dora is packed and ready to leave. She admits to being a spy and then shoots him in the shoulder, before her gun jams. Jim kills her, just before Roger arrives. Afterward, Jim joins the Royal Air Force as a gunner.

He assisted in the early days of Unitarianism in England. Early life Born in Leeds, Yorkshire, on 6 March 1733, he was one of eight sons and ten children of cloth merchant Thomas Lee and his wife, Mary (n√©e Reveley). After his father died in 1736 he was mainly brought up by his mother, a Dissenter and friend of Thomas Secker, later Archbishop of Canterbury, who died in 1750. Legal career Lee was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn and joined the Northern Circuit, where eventually he gained an equal share with James Wallace of the leadership. He was a king's attorney and serjeant for the County Palatine of Lancaster from 1782 until his death. In April 1769 Lee appeared before the House of Commons with John Glynn as counsel for John Wilkes and the petitioners against the return of Colonel Henry Luttrell for Middlesex; the petition failed. The government offered him a seat in the house and the K.C. in 1769, and in 1770 K.C. with the appointment of solicitor-general to the queen, but he refused both offers on political grounds. On 18 September 1769 he became, however, recorder of Doncaster. The appointment was through the influence of Lord Rockingham, whom Lee knew through the law, and signalled Lee's arrival as legal adviser to the Rockingham Whigs. In the Wilkite agitation of that year around the Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights, Rockingham brought Lee and Alexander Wedderburn to Wentworth, to steer a moderate course, and in mid- September they found a precedent from 1701 for a petition to the Crown to dissolve parliament. In 1779 Lee was one of the counsel for Admiral Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel when he was tried by court-martial for his conduct in the Battle of Ushant. The trial in Portsmouth was politicised, Keppel being a Whig, and his second-in-command, Sir Hugh Palliser, a Tory, acting for the prosecution. When Keppel's name was cleared, Lee took no fee, but Keppel gave him his own portrait, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. In 1780 Lee became a king's counsel. Known at the bar as \\"honest Jack Lee\\", he was distinguished for his integrity, and amassed a large fortune. Portrait of Augustus Keppel by Reynolds, given to Lee by Keppel In politics In the second administration of Lord Rockingham, Lee was appointed Solicitor General for England and Wales, and sat in parliament for Clitheroe. It was a pocket borough, controlled by Thomas Lister and the Curzon family. Lister was a Whig, Assheton Curzon a Tory ministerialist, and when the two came to an agreement in 1790 to share the double-member seat, Lee lost out. It meant he had no seat in the 1790 British general election. Later that year, he was brought in for Higham Ferrers by the Whig magnate William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam at a by-election, Viscount Duncannon preferring . He then sat for that constituency till he died. Lee resigned office on Rockingham's death, but returned to it under the Duke of Portland, and on the death of Wallace at the end of 1783, he was promoted to be Attorney General for England and Wales, and held the office till the Duke of Portland was dismissed. In politics he was a thoroughgoing party man. One of his maxims was \\"Never speak well of a political enemy\\". John Wilkes spoke of him as having been in the House of Commons \\"a most impudent dog\\"; Nathaniel Wraxall called him coarse and abusive, though he acknowledged his intelligence: \\"a man of strong intellectual parts, though of very coarse manners\\". Malvern House, 7 Front Street, Staindrop, County Durham today, once owned by John Lee Death and family Monument to John Lee in Staindrop Church, Joseph Nollekens (1795) Lee died from cancer on 5 August 1793, having suffered from ill health and played little part in politics at the end of his life. He was buried at Staindrop Church, County Durham. The monument there, by Joseph Nollekens, was paid for by Earl Fitzwilliam.David Wilson, Nollekens and Fox in the temple: The \\"Armitstead\\" bust, The British Art Journal Vol. 4, No. 3 (Autumn 2003), pp. 65‚Äì79, at p. 68.

Lee had married in 1769 Mary Hutchinson (1734‚Äì1812), daughter of William Hutchinson of Staindrop, and obtained a house and estate there. They had a daughter, Mary Tabitha (1777‚Äì1851). His father-in-law was agent to Henry Vane, 2nd Earl of Darlington. Associations Joseph Priestley and Richard Price were among Lee's friends, and he associated with pro-Americans and radicals. \\"Honest Whig\\" and pro-American Lee knew Benjamin Franklin through the Whig coffee- house club ‚Äî Franklin's \\"club of Honest Whigs\\" of his first mission in London (1757‚Äì1762) ‚Äî which he frequented with Priestley, Price and Andrew Kippis, and introduced Priestley to Edmund Burke. On a later Franklin visit, that of 1773‚Äì5, Lee was one of those who met in Ludgate Hill, at the London Coffee House.Duncan Wu, William Hazlitt (1737‚Äì1820), the Priestley Circle, and \\"The Theological Repository:\\" A Brief Survey and Bibliography, The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 56, No. 227 (November 2005), pp. 758‚Äì766, at p. 762. Published by: Oxford University Press It was the so-called \\"fortnight club\\". In Franklin's Privy Council hearing of 1774, over the Hutchinson Letters Affair, Lee acted as his counsel, as second to John Dunning. With Thomas Townshend, Lee was attacked in 1775 by John Shebbeare writing as a government hack for Lord North's administration. Religious views and Essex Street Chapel By family background in Leeds, Lee was associated with Mill Hill Chapel, which was de facto Unitarian. His own views were influenced by his friend Priestley. He met Theophilus Lindsey through Priestley and William Turner of Wakefield, in the late 1760s. He was a sympathetic adviser to the promoters of the Feathers Tavern petition of 1772 to Parliament, asking for lifting of restrictions on religious dissenters. A leading figure in the petition was Theophilus Lindsey, a priest of the Church of England, who in 1773 resigned his Yorkshire living because of religious scruples of conscience, a step against Lee's wishes because the chances were his replacement would be High Church or an evangelical, rather than a liberal. In 1774 Lee helped Lindsey establish the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England. It was Lord Shelburne, a financial backer, who directed Lee, and Sir George Saville, towards Lindsey's Unitarians.Duncan Wu, William Hazlitt (1737‚Äì1820), the Priestley Circle, and \\"The Theological Repository:\\" A Brief Survey and Bibliography, The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 56, No. 227 (November 2005), pp. 758‚Äì766, at p. 763. Published by: Oxford University Press Before the 1813 Act it was illegal to deny the doctrine of the Trinity, but the temper of the times allowed for some latitude. Lee persuaded the relevant London justices to register the Essex Street Chapel at Hicks Hall, and attended Lindsey's inaugural sermon.chapter 2 The History of Essex Hall by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D. Lindsey Press, 1959 In 1775, Lee, Lindsey and his wife and Priestley were meeting regularly on Sunday mornings. Lee was known as a nonconformist. With Sir William Fowle Middleton, 1st Baronet, he voted in parliament in 1789 for legal relief for dissenters, when the Test Acts and Corporation Act were debated.G. M. Ditchfield, The Parliamentary Struggle over the Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, 1787‚Äì1790, The English Historical Review Vol. 89, No. 352 (July 1974), pp. 551‚Äì577, at p. 553. Published by: Oxford University Press Later years In 1779 Burke consulted Lee on his own affairs, and a case concerning the Irish army officer Bigoe Armstrong (died 1794). With Charles James Fox and others, Lee worked successfully for the release of John Trumbull, during the American Revolutionary War. In the small group of Rockingham Whigs involved in the Yorkshire Association petition of early 1780, with Shelburne, Burke, Keppel and George Byng, he wrote again to Christopher Wyvill in support of the Association in 1782.N. C. Phillips, Edmund Burke and the County Movement, 1779‚Äì1780, The English Historical Review Vol. 76, No. 299 (April 1961), pp. 254‚Äì278 at p. 266. Published by: Oxford University Press John Burgoyne, on parole in England after his capture by the Continental Army, was summoned back to America in 1781 (apparently tit-for-tat, in relation to the detention in the Tower of London of Henry Laurens. The advice of Lee and Charles James Fox led to an appeal to Benjamin Franklin, carried out by Burke. In Fytch's Case, Lee won the case, on a resignation bond given for a church living, in the Court of Common Pleas in 1782 against the Bishop of London, on behalf of Lewis Disney Fytche. The decision was reversed on appeal. Samuel Heywood was one of Lee's friends from the Northern Circuit. In 1783, Lee represented the owners of the slave ship Zong in court, after its owners tried to force their insurers to pay them for the loss of 132 slaves murdered by the ship's crew. His legal argument invoked the concept of chattel slavery and became notorious in abolitionist circles; it cannot be taken as his personal view, and the same goes for Heywood, another dissenter on the insurers's legal team.Anthony Page, Rational Dissent, Enlightenment, and Abolition of the British Slave Trade, The Historical JournalVol. 54, No. 3 (September 2011), pp. 741‚Äì772, at p. 760.

The oriole whistler is sometimes alternatively called the yellow-throated whistler, leading to confusion between both species. Taxonomy and systematics  The Yellow-throated whistler was originally described in the genus Myiolestes (a synonym for Colluricincla). The yellow-throated whistler is variably considered as either a subspecies of the Australian golden whistler or treated as a separate species, but strong published evidence in favour of either treatment is limited, and further study is warranted to resolve the complex taxonomic situation.Boles, W.

In addition to his theatrical work, Domville served in several important Canadian cultural positions, including five years as Commissioner of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Domville was born in Cannes on the French Riviera to a Canadian father and an American mother. He was a great-grandson of Canadian politician James Domville on his father's side and a grandson of Dutch American novelist Edgar Evertson Saltus through his socialite mother Elsie Welsh Saltus. He attended Selwyn House School and Trinity College School and studied at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland and then at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from which he gained a Bachelor of Civil Law degree. His first theatre work was the production of the satirical musical My Fur Lady. He was co-writer and producer of My Fur Lady, which was a success, being produced at the Stratford Festival and then touring Canada from 1957 to 1958. Following on from this, Domville co-founded a theatre production company, Quince Productions. He co-produced Jubilee and Spring Thaw over the following few years, and was also involved in theatre design, helping to plan the Fredericton Playhouse and the National Theatre School of Canada. From 1964 until 1968, he served as the National Theatre School's Director-General. He was then the Executive Director of the Th√©√¢tre du Nouveau Monde from 1968 until 1972. He also sat on the Advisory Arts Panel of the Canada Council from 1968 until 1972, serving as the panel's chairman for the final three of those years. It was in 1972 that he first became involved with the National Film Board, being appointed its Assistant Director of English Production. He became Executive Producer in charge of the NFB's drama film output in 1974, and then in September 1975 was appointed Assistant Film Commissioner by Andr√© Lamy. In his time at the NFB he pursued his enthusiasm for underwater diving by directing two films about the subject, Sub-Igloo and Arctic IV, and co-producing an evening of programming on the theme for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which included a live transmission from the bottom of Resolute Bay. In 1977, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. In January 1979, Domville succeeded Lamy as Government Film Commissioner and Chair of the NFB. He later claimed that this was the only job he had ever really wanted.Evans, p. 287. He faced a time of cutbacks and austerity at the NFB, but received praise for changing NFB policy in supporting the Canadian film industry by allowing private companies, rather than the NFB, to undertake the majority of sponsored film production. It was also during Domville's time in charge of the NFB that its Studio D unit produced the controversial documentary features Not a Love Story (1981) and If You Love This Planet (1982).Evans, p. 283. Following disagreements with the government, and despite feeling that it had been the most interesting phase of his career, Domville left his role at the NFB in January 1984. He died of melanoma in Singapore on April 2, 2015, at the age of 81.

In New York City he was the business partner of the actor-managers Dion Boucicault and Edwin Booth, and with them leased and managed the Winter Garden Theatre. He managed the New Park Theatre on Broadway from 1874 to 1876. Biography Early life A native of Knockbane, Moycullen, Galway, he was educated at Eton when Cardinal Wiseman was headmaster. O'Flaherty became the private secretary to the Duke of Newcastle, who wanted to forge an alliance between the Peelite party and that of the Irish MP's. O'Flaherty's ability was recognised by the Duke, who employed him as an emissary to Ireland, and gave him a Commissionership of Income Tax in Galway. He was active in Irish politics in the middle years of the 19th century. Described as \\"a man of great warmth, cleverness and inexhaustible resource\\", he was a friend of William Keogh and John Sadleir.Keogh was an unpopular and controversial Irish politician and judge, whose name became a byword in Ireland for betraying one's political principles. Sadleir, an Irish MP, was a scandal-prone financial fraudster who managed to dispose over ¬£1.5 million of other peoples' money, mainly in disastrous speculations. He committed suicide on Hampstead Heath in February 1856. In 1854 he disappeared from London and rumours were current throughout the city that warrants were out against him for forgery. Persons concerned included Lord Bolingbroke, Lord Dunkellin, Bernal Osborne and Sir William Gregory, the late Governor of Ceylon. 'William Stuart' O'Flaherty escaped via Denmark (which had no extradition treaty with Britain) to the U.S. under the alias of 'Captain William Stuart'. To earn a living he began by writing for the papers, made some money, and began a partnership with the actor Dion Boucicault, another expatriate Irishman. Together they leased Wallack's Theatre in 1855-1856, and put on a short season at the Washington Theatre in Washington D.C.\\"Death of William Stuart\\", New-York Tribune, December 29, 1886:5, col. 5. Online at Library of Congress.‚ÄúDeath of William Stuart‚Äù, The New York Times, December 29, 1886. After this they took over the Winter Garden Theatre, where Stuart was joint lessee and manager. It opened in September 1859 with John Jefferson in Boucicault's Dot, an adaptation of Charles Dickens's The Cricket on the Hearth. Boucicault's The Octoroon opened on 8 December 8, 1859, but arguments over money and ownership of the play led to Boucicault and his wife Agnes leaving for Laura Keene's Theatre at 622-624 Broadway, and then for England.Laura Keene's Theatre burned down in 1881. \\"Where Was Laura Keene‚Äôs Theatre?\\" (27 May 2015) Greenwich Village Society for Historical Preservation. Retrieved 11 September 2017. Stuart remained at the Winter Garden. He was still heavily involved in recruiting American help for a free Ireland, as a letter dated October 5, 1861 from New York to John O'Mahony, later founder of the Fenian Brotherhood makes clear: :\\"I would remind [the expectants] that another famine ever imperils Ireland, the result of a wet summer and harvest. If matters go on thus much longer there will be no Irish Nation for us to free. If we are to redeem our country, we must do it soon, or not at all [...] :\\"I now leave our cause in the hands of her patriot sons in America [...] I trust the 'Centres' throughout the States will rally round you. If they work they will get all the power required and Ireland must be free. If they fail in their duty, to God and their Country, then is Ireland doomed‚Äîdoomed to become an integral part of the British Empire as Scotland, once Celtic and now Saxon‚Äîmore Saxon than England herself. [I pray] that Heaven will send us labourers for the work.Letter from Edmund O'Flaherty to John O'Mahony, October 5, 1861. Pinterest. Retrieved 13 September 2017. Edwin Booth joined Stuart as co-lessee in the management of the Winter Garden On 21 February 1863. On November 26, 1864, Booth played the lead role in the first of what became known as the ‚Äú100 nights Hamlet\\",Brown, p. 460 a record which stood for fifty- six years.The record of Booth's 100 consecutive performances of Hamlet lasted until John Barrymore played exactly 101 Hamlets in 1920. The Winter Garden Theatre burned down 23 March 1867. Stuart at the time of the discovery was in his sleeping apartment in the theatre, only partially dressed, and was compelled to leave his watch and pocket-book on the table when he made his hurried exit. Stuart, who was wholly uninsured, barely escaped with his life. A performance of The Black Crook on 27 March 1867 at Niblo's Garden was given as a benefit for him.\\"Black Crook\\". Music in Gotham. Retrieved 11 September 2017. Stuart turned to writing for the New York Herald for some time, and again in partnership with Boucicault built the New Park Theatre in 1873‚Äì1874. However, Boucicault withdrew just before the theatre opened, and Stuart teamed up instead with the actor, playwright and theatre manager Charles Fechter as stage manager. The New Park Theatre opened on 13 April or 15 April 1874 with Stuart as manager, and Fechter appearing in his own play Love's Penance, an adaptation of Le m√©decin des enfants by Count d'Avrigny. Edwin Booth, who had been with Stuart at the Winter Garden, was fairly scathing about the whole enterprise: :\\"I should like to hear of Stuart's success - but I doubt it, for I fear Fechter is unlucky, & Stuart really possesses very little, if any theatrical business capacity. F's remarkable talents both as actor and as stage manager shd. ensure the success of any theatre - could he be managed; otherwise I doubt the safety of any enterprise he has to do with.\\"Fechter was noted for an imperious temper, and had left two or three other theatres after arguments. Love's Penance closed on May 6, 1874, and shortly after Fechter withdrew from the management and retired. Stuart continued to run the New Park Theatre until the fall of 1876 when he sold it to Henry E. Abbey. Retirement and death O'Flaherty/Stuart had become successful and again famous for his hospitality and parties. It was well known that there was something against him, but it was presumed that he left England being unable to pay his debts. Englishmen of great position, on their return from America, told how they had been entertained by the pleasantest and wittiest of Irishmen, Captain Stuart. He spent the large income he was making, fell into poverty, and died in New York on 27 December 1886. Justin Huntly McCarthy, M.P., wrote of him: > [John Sadleir's] lieutenants were his brother, James Sadleir, Mr. William > Keogh, and Mr. Edmund O'Flaherty: these men were all adventurers, and most > of them swindlers.

In 2001, the editor-in-chief of Vogue USA Anna Wintour named Josephus Thimister as one of the Twenty-First Century's best fashion designers. In 2010, Cathy Horyn writing for the New York Times described his couture show and its pieces as, \\"fascinating (‚Ä¶) quite clear in military shapes and broken elegance. Dresses like melted down family silver\\". After a brief period with Karl Lagerfeld as an assistant, he worked as a designer at Jean Patou before being appointed director of luxury pr√™t-√†-porter at the house of Balenciaga. It was for the next five and a half years that Thimister would spend reviving the brand with his pure, succinctly modernist vision. He then set up his own Paris-based house in 1997, and thereafter presented both haute couture and pr√™t-√†-porter collections under his name. Early life and career Born to parents of Russian, Belgian, and French descent in Maastricht, Netherlands in 1962, Thimister knew of his passion for design at the age of four. His ambitions soon materialized when he graduated from the fashion department of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp summa cum laude in 1987; the same year Thimister claimed first prize for design in the institution. Within a year, the aspiring designer found himself working under Karl Lagerfeld, then creative director of Chanel and also of his own eponymous label. Early career Thimister then worked at the House of Patou in preparation of their 1990 haute-couture collection. From 1987 to 1992, Thimister also freelanced as an illustrator and interior decorator for magazines (Vogue, Vogue D√©co, Elle D√©co, World of Interiors), private clients, exhibitions (Maison et Object, Mus√©e Carnavalet, Grand Palais), and created art installations in Rome. Balenciaga Years In 1991, Thimister advanced toward Balenciaga where he would hold the position as artistic director of luxury women‚Äôs pr√™t-√†-porter and accessories for over half a decade. It was said that at Balenciaga, he \\"contributed through his minimalist style and great skills in cutting in modernizing the house's image.\\" After spending nearly six years with Balenciaga, Thimister began to design for the Italian ready-to-wear label Genny in 1998. At Genny, Thimister readapted classic military coats and bias-cut gowns; synthesizing dramatic, long leather skirts with elegant crisp cotton-glazed shirts. His designs showed a different approach of the art, demonstrating his individuality among the established couture names. Critics were struck by the modernity and apparent simplicity of his silhouettes. In February 2005, Thimister was named head designer by the house of Charles Jourdan, in replacement of Patrick Cox. Working at Charles Jourdan, Thimister became known for his poetically Nordic, lightly surrealist and controversial creations. Thimister thereafter did stints with various fashion-influenced institutions for three years. He designed a collection inspired by Andy Warhol entitled \\"Andy Warhol: Heroes & Icons\\", put on display in 2006 around Europe. He also supervised and consulted the concept design of handbags under the Swarovski name. House of Thimister In a few years, Thimister had designed an entire m√©lange of haute couture and luxury pr√™t-a- porter pieces. In January 2010, after being invited by the F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise de la couture, his return show was met with resounding success and received much praise from the press and the industry. The collection, termed \\"1915: Bloodshed and Opulence\\" an anti-war collection, was a medley of recycled military jackets and canvas tents, and elegant couture finishing of silk, crepe and satin lining. \\"I‚Äôm convinced that all of today‚Äôs problems are the conclusion of that period\\", claimed Thimister in an interview with Style.com, \\"I am recycling some of my favorite fabrics, like imperial satin and wool blends\\". An array of ultra-brut fused with ultra-sophistiqu√© materials were hence formed. The brand now boasts celebrated pieces of blood Red, rough Khaki and faded Ivory; pieces defined as ‚Äústarkly beautiful‚Äùhttp://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9DECO3O0.html \\\\- (Jenny Barchfield) Personal life Josephus Thimister resided in Dublin, Ireland as well as in Paris, France near his eponymous fashion house.

Education Educated at Brecon Grammar School, Christ College, Brecon, and Queens' College, Cambridge. Physician He qualified as a physician and surgeon at Guy's Hospital and was Treasurer's gold medallist in medicine. Barrister He was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1930. Politician Ilford Ilford in Essex, showing boundaries used in 1931 He was Liberal candidate for Ilford in the 1931 election. It was a promising seat which the Liberals had nearly gained from the Conservatives in 1929. At the 1931 elections, the Liberal party was split into three groups and Thomas remained with the official Liberals under Sir Herbert Samuel, in support of the National Government. He finished third in Ilford, just behind the Labour candidate. He remained loyal to the official Liberal party when it left the National government in 1932. Aberdeenshire Central Despite his poor showing at Ilford in 1931, for the 1935 election he was selected as Liberal candidate in the promising constituency of Aberdeenshire Central where the Liberal in 1931 finished a close second behind the Conservative in a two-party contest. However, in 1935, the Labour party intervened and in a three-way contest Thomas finished third, again just behind Labour. Ross & Cromarty His next attempt to enter parliament was also in Scotland at the 1936 Ross and Cromarty by-election. In 1935, the Liberal National candidate was re-elected unopposed. When the by-election came around, a minority section of the local Liberal Association wanted a Liberal to stand and were unhappy when the majority decided to support a National Labour candidate. The Scottish Liberal Federation persuaded Thomas to stand as a Liberal candidate.Trial by Ballot by Ivor Davies However, the result was a disaster for Thomas as he finished fourth. Following this disappointment, Thomas decided to switch his support from the official Liberal party to the Liberal National party. Southampton His connection with the Liberal Nationals was far more rewarding when he was chosen as the National government's candidate for the 1940 by-election in Southampton. By then, a war time electoral truce between the main political parties was in operation, so Thomas was returned unopposed. At the 1945 General election, Thomas sought re- election as a Liberal National candidate in support of Winston Churchill. Southampton was a dual member seat and he ran in tandem with a Conservative against two Labour candidates and a Liberal. However, he lost his seat and finished fourth. Thomas contested Middlesbrough East in the 1950 general election, however, this time not as a Liberal National but as an official Liberal candidate. He came third with 10% of the vote. Brecon & Radnor Despite his Welsh heritage, none of his previous electoral challenges was in his native Wales. However he was selected as Liberal candidate for Brecon & Radnor for the 1955 General election. Having been raised in Brecon, he might have had hopes of winning. However, the Liberals had not contested the seat in 1951 and in 1950, their candidate finished a poor third. The 1955 elections represented the lowest point in the fortunes of the Liberal party and Thomas was to finish third once again. This was to be his electoral swansong.

The fish can grow from in length, has large eyes, a greenish-gray color on its back, and a silver band along its sides. Unlike most other smelt species which generally have no enlarged teeth in the roof of their mouth, the whitebait has single large tooth in the center of its vomer, which is sometimes flanked by a smaller tooth on either side. The adult males of the species have a longer anal fin. Their range extends from Vancouver Island to San Francisco, California, although one fish has been found as far south as San Pedro, California, a specimen which may have been released as live bait. Often abundant in bay areas, whitebait are known to spawn on subtidal sandbanks and swim in schools. The fish has fairly minor economic importance; it serves as food for larger fish, and is netted by some fishermen during the spring and summer to be used as bait.

Background  Until the early 1980s, the tonal palette of commercial synthesizers was limited to that which could be obtained by combining a few simple waveforms such as sine, sawtooth, pulse. The result was shaped with VCFs and VCAs. Wolfgang Palm transcended this limitation by pioneering the concept of wavetable synthesis, where single cycle waveforms of differing harmonic spectra were stored in adjacent memory slots. Dynamic spectral shifts were achieved by scanning through the waveforms, with interpolation used to avoid noticeable 'jumps' between the adjacent waveforms. Palm's efforts resulted in PPG's first wavetable synthesizer, the Wavecomputer 360 (1978), which provides the user with 30 different wavetables consisting of 64 waves each. While the expansive range of sound is evident, the absence of filters results in the Wavecomputer 360 sounding buzzy and thin, which hampered its original commercial viability. Palm's efforts to resolve the apparent shortcomings of the Wavecomputer 360 would result in the creation of PPG's Wave series of synthesizers.  Specifications  PPG's Wave series represents an evolution of its predecessor by combining its digital sound engine with analog VCAs and 24db per octave VCFs, featuring 8-voice polyphony; and by replacing its nontraditional series of push buttons and sliders with a control panel consisting of an LCD and a more familiar arrangement of knobs. Also added to the Wave series was an onboard sequencer that is capable of recording filtering and wavetable changes in real time. At the core of the Wave's processing unit is a Motorola 6809 CPU, and a variety of 6500 and 6800-series support ICs. MIDI support was added in 1984, via a 6840/6850 daughtercard.Photos of MIDI retrofit kit for PPG Wave The PPG Wave was produced in three successive variants, the control panels of which were all liveried in distinctive ultramarine RAL 5002 blue: * Wave 2 (1981‚Äì1982) - 8 oscillators (one per voice), 8-bit resolution, single modulation wheel, CEM 3320 VCFs * Wave 2.2 (1982‚Äì1984) - 16 oscillators (two per voice), 8-bit resolution, dual modulation wheels, SSM 2044 VCFs * Wave 2.3 (1984‚Äì1987) - 16 oscillators (two per voice), 12-bit resolution for samples via Waveterm (only) otherwise 8-bit, dual modulation wheels, SSM 2044 VCFs, 8-part multitimbrality PPG Wave 2.2 front panel thumb The PPG Wave can be connected to multiple peripheral PPG components simultaneously, via a custom bus, such as a \\"smart\\" keyboard controller (PRK), 8-voice expansion units (EVU), and a wave computer called Waveterm A (later B version arrived) for sampling, audio manipulation, editing, sequencing and creating user defined wavetables. Collectively, this setup is referred to as the \\"PPG Wave System\\", which with its sampling ad sequencing was intended to compete with the more expensive Fairlight CMI. Market success The PPG Wave quickly earned distinction from traditional analog synthesizers.Sound on Sound Wave 2.3 & Waveterm B Review Notable artists which used the Wave included: a-ha, Alphaville, David Bowie, Diane Arkenstone, The Fixx, Go West, Hall & Oates, Trevor Horn, Propaganda, Laza Ristovski, Jean Michel Jarre, Marillion, Level 42, Art of Noise, Saga, Rush, Depeche Mode, Gary Numan, Robert Palmer, Gary Stadler, Kitaro, Jean-Benoit Dunckel, Psychedelic Furs, Tangerine Dream, The Stranglers, Talk Talk, Tears for Fears, Michelle Tumes, The Twins, Steve Winwood, Stevie Nicks, Thomas Dolby, Ultravox, Wang Chung, Eurogliders, Stevie Wonder and Ilan Chester. Market decline PPG's innovation in the realm of digital synthesizer technology impacted the industry. The PPG Wave synthesizer's price in its initial few years was -10,000.Wave 2.2 Price 1984 Within a few years, digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7 (1983), Korg DW-8000 (1985), Ensoniq ESQ-1 (1986), and Sequential Prophet VS (1986), would be launched at lower prices. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving development of digital sampling technology and reductions in memory prices facilitated the emergence of a new generation of standalone, easy-to-use samplers, such as the Emu Emulator II (1984), Ensoniq Mirage (1984), and Sequential Prophet 2000 (1985). PPG's dwindling market share and the high development cost of new products created financial difficulties that resulted in the cessation of company operations in 1987.  After PPG  The end of PPG saw the beginning of Waldorf GmbH (later Waldorf Music), which used PPG's technology to create the Microwave (1989), a streamlined, rack-mounted approximation of the PPG Wave 2.3 with original wavetables and analog filters. Further evolutions of the original theme would appear in later years, including the extensive WAVE synthesizer (1993), the DSP-driven Microwave II (1997), and the knob-laden Microwave II variants, the XT and XTk (1998‚Äì1999).Waldorf Microwave Series After PPG, other manufacturers also produced Wavetable 'look-up' synthesizers, such as Sequential's Prophet VS (1986) and Ensoniq's VFX series (1989). Later came the arrival of synthesizers such as the Access Virus Ti (1997), Waldorf Blofeld (2007), which included 64 wavetables, and Ensoniq's FIZMO (1998), with its Transwave architecture. None of these designs replicates the 'wave-scanning' and interpolation that occurs from adjacent waves, in a table, as with the PPG. The Waldorf Quantum (2018) comes closer to the PPG in wavetable capabilities. More recent advancements in personal computing technology made possible the release of VST plugin models of the original PPG Wave series, including Waldorf's Wave 2.V (2000), and Wave 3.V (2011). The latter was co-developed with Palm, and more accurately replicates the familiar aliasing and filtering characteristics of both the Wave 2.2 and 2.3. However, the ability of the VSTs to replicate the combination of the original Wave's 12-bit sound with SSM analog filters remains limited.Sound on Sound Wave 3.V ReviewWaldorf Wave 3.V Overview Synthtopia Wave 3.V Review  See also  * Wavetable synthesis * Waldorf Music - The WAVE and Microwave * Monowave  References  Further reading *  External links  PPG Wave OS V8.3 * Virtual Music¬¥s Synthesizer Service - Specialized in worldwide PPG Wave repair/service (also card-repair only) * A hardware-level software simulator of PPG Wave with software Waveterm C these were newly developed to work with hardware/software mixture environment of PPG Bus system.

Until his death in 1973 it continued serving as an additional residence, along with two others, one private ‚Äì \\"Ben-Gurion's hut\\" at Kibbutz Sde Boker in the Negev (known as his desert home), and the official residence as Prime Minister of Israel during his multiple terms as head of government.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/bghouse.html The latter, known as Julius Jacobs House, is located in Rehavia, Jerusalem. Ben-Gurion House is located at 17, Ben-Gurion Boulevard in northern Tel Aviv. History and structure The house was built in 1930‚Äì1931, and David Ben- Gurion and his family lived there from June 1931 until 1953, when they moved to a small wooden house in Kibbutz Sde-Boker in the Negev desert, after which they returned to the Tel Aviv house only part of each year. The house was built on Jewish National Fund (JNF) land,Ben-Gurion House (museum website) , retrieved 14 December 2017 when the first shechunat ha-po'alim (lit. workers neighborhood, i.e. a workers housing project) was established there in 1930‚Äì31, as Shechunat HaPo'alim Aleph, at the junction of Jewish National Fund Boulevard and Lassalle Street.Danny Recht, The United Workers' Neighborhood A and B (in Hebrew, ('◊©◊õ◊ï◊†◊™ ◊§◊ï◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊û◊ê◊ï◊ó◊ì◊™ (◊ê' ◊ë' ◊ï), on \\"Tel Aviv 100\\" website ; retrieved 14 December 2017 The Jewish National Fund (Hebrew: Keren Kayemet Le'Israel) Boulevard was renamed to Ben-Gurion Boulevard after the politician's death in 1973. The house was designed by engineer David Tuvia, and as customary in \\"workers neighborhoods\\" in Israel at the time, the house included only one room and was worth 350 British Mandate pounds. The Ben- Gurion family asked for permission to build a second floor, which was granted. The house was expanded in 1946, and renovated in 1960. First floor The first floor included the room of Ben-Gurion's second daughter, Renana. It also served Ben-Gurion during the Suez Crisis (Mivtza' Kadesh, \\"Operation Kadesh\\") as a shelter and a bedroom. From this room Ben-Gurion conducted his communication with Moshe Dayan, then his Chief of Staff, and from there he received front line updates on the progress of the operation. Second floor The second floor houses a four-room library, a toilet and a bedroom, and served only Ben-Gurion himself at the time. The library holds his personal collection of periodicals and 20,000 books, in ancient Greek, Latin, English, Hebrew, French, Turkish, German, Russian and other languages. The library, known for its unusual size, may give an idea as to Ben-Gurion's fields of interest. The books deal mainly with the subjects of Zionism, history, various cultures and religions, a collections of Hebrew Bible books and more. The many books on IDF's fallen soldiers show the importance given to this subject by Ben-Gurion. One of the library rooms served as Ben-Gurion's study room, where he had his own study corner, in which he wrote in his diary. It also contained a special phone, that was a direct line to the Defense Ministry's office (compare the Red Phone). On 13 May 1948, Ben-Gurion hosted the Minhelet ha'am (People's Administration) body: Aharon Zisling, Yehuda Leib Maimon, and Moshe Sharett, where they formulated and drafted the final version of the Israeli Declaration of Independence (Megilat HaAtzma'ut). The next day, they went from this house to Dizengoff House, now known as Independence Hall, and where the Tel Aviv Museum of Art was located at the time, where Ben-Gurion announced on the establishment of the State of Israel. The house nowadays 350px In his will Ben-Gurion requested to bequest the house to the State of Israel, as is stated: Three years after Ben-Gurion died, the Ben-Gurion law 1977 was enacted, which stipulates that the house will be open to the public, and will serve as a museum in memory of Ben-Gurion and as a commemoration of his legacy, as well \\"as a Reading, Reviewing and Research center\\", as Ben-Gurion himself requested. The house was opened to the public on 29 November 1974, and as of today, guided tours and symposiums are conducted in the house, with the purpose of depicting Ben-Gurion's character and life work as a leader. In addition, memorabilia, historical documents, and Ben-Gurion's titles awarded to him when he was prime minister are exhibited in the house. The Boulevard in which the house is situated, was called at the time Ben-Gurion lived there, Keren Kayemet Boulevard (\\"Jewish National Fund Boulevard\\"), and was renamed Ben-Gurion Boulevard after Ben-Gurion died. The name Keren Kayemet Boulevard was then moved to a central street within a northern Tel Aviv neighborhood, Ever Ha-Yarkon suburb, and is still named after the JNF today.

Ladd and Lake made four films together; This Gun for Hire and The Glass Key, both in 1942, The Blue Dahlia in 1946 and Saigon. While the earlier films all proved to be big box office successes, Saigon did not do as well financially. Ladd continued to remain one of Paramount's top male stars, while Lake's career was in decline. By the end of 1948 her contract with Paramount had expired and the studio chose not to renew it.

Larry and Sergeant Pete Rocco are determined to show Mike a good time before he dies. For a $10,000 fee, Larry takes a flying job working for Alex Maris, a profiteer. Everything is set until Maris' secretary, Susan Cleaver, shows up to board the aircraft. Mike falls for Susan and Larry convinces her to play along but she has fallen in love with Larry. The first flight is disrupted by Maris arriving a half-hour late with the police right behind. Larry takes off but is forced to make an emergency landing after both engines fail. After checking into a small hotel, the Americans find Police Lieutenant Keon, who is shadowing them, believing that they are smugglers. When Larry sees Mike falling for Susan, he wants the romance to end and despite her carrying $500,000 for Maris, Larry tells her to leave immediately. When Mike longs for Susan, Larry relents and blackmails her into seeing him or he will turn her into Keon. Sailing to Saigon on a boat, Larry tricks Keon by stowing the money away into an envelope he mails to himself, and throws all suspicion off Susan. On reaching Saigon, Larry knows he has fallen in love with Susan even though Mike has proposed to her. At Susan's hotel, an enraged Maris and his valet Simon hold Larry hostage, demanding the money that has been posted. Bursting in, Pete realizes what is happening, and fights with Simon, but both men fall off a balcony to their deaths. Susan has secretly arranged to retrieve the money from the post office, returning it to Maris. Mike and Larry confront him but in an exchange of gunfire, Mike and Maris are killed. After Mike's funeral, Larry and Susan start a new life together.

History  The castle was built in 1227 by Hugo (Hugues) de Rothenbourg, abbot prince of Murbach from 1216 to 1236. It was constructed between the communes of Buhl and Guebwiller, to defend both the Murbach Abbey and the entrance to the Florival valley. In 1313, the abbot Conrad Wiedergrun de Stauffenberg consecrated the castle chapel to the Holy Cross and Saint Beno√Æt. Abbot Barth√©l√©my d'Andlau modernised the castle during the 15th century, notably adding a gate tower decorated with a frieze and equipped with a drawbridge (visible in the photo). Two new towers were also added to the defensive system of the castle even though its principal role had become residential. Georges de Masevaux continued with the restoration but died in 1542. The castle then became the subject of a quarrel about succession between Henri de Jestetten and his cousin Rodolphe Stoer de Stoerenbourg, abbot of Honcourt and Capitulary of Murbach. The latter finally won, but the fortress suffered from the affair. In 1598, the castle was struck by lightning. At the start of the 17th century, it was used as a prison, particularly for Lutherans and witches, of whom it is said that some were burned in front of the castle. Abandoned, it provided shelter for the poor before finally being used as a stone quarry. The stone which built the castle was extracted from the moat which surrounded it. The cylindrical keep, 10 m in diameter, is comparatively rare in Alsace. The higher part of the keep was removed when the site served as a quarry.

Biography Bulgarian in origin, Chryselios was the \\"leading man\\" (proteuon) of Dyrrhachium. According to another opinion, his name is not Bulgarian and there is no evidence that Chryselios was Bulgarian; it is suggested that he was of Armenian Paulician or Bogomil origin.Nicholas Adontz. Samuel l'Armenien, Roi des Bulgares. In: Etudes Armeno-Byzantines. Publisher: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. Lisbon, 1965, p. 395, 396. According to a note on the history of John Skylitzes, the Bulgarian tsar Samuel married Chryselios's daughter Agatha, who was taken captive after Samuel sacked the city of Larissa. It is possible that thereby Samuel managed to acquire control over the strategically important Adriatic port city. After the Battle of Spercheios in 997, Samuel made his son-in-law Ashot Taronites, a Byzantine captive who had married his daughter Miroslava, governor of the city. In circa 1005, however, Ashot and Miroslava, with the connivance of Chryselios, fled on a Byzantine ship to Constantinople, bearing a letter by Chryselios that promised to hand over the city to the Byzantine emperor, Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025), in exchange for the rank of patrikios for himself and his two sons. Soon, a Byzantine squadron appeared off the city under Eustathios Daphnomeles, and the city returned to Byzantine rule, but Chryselios had died in the meantime. It is, however, possible that this episode actually took place as late as 1018, at the end of the Bulgarian war, since the chronology of the war's primary source, John Skylitzes, is unclear; while the Italian chronicle of Lupus Protospatharius gives a completely different date for the recovery of Dyrrhachium, 1004/5, and does not mention Chryselios at all. Family Apart from his daughter Agatha, modern Bulgarian scholars equate a patrikios Nicholas Chryselios or Nicholas the Bulgarian, recorded by Skylitzes as being active under Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028‚Äì34), with one of John Chryselios' sons. A certain Theodoretos, who was the father of Kosara, the wife of Prince Jovan Vladimir of Duklja, has also been suggested by modern scholarship as one of Chryselios' sons.

The film deals with an open relationship between the three leads.IMDb.com, Splendor, accessed July 4, 2012 Plot When struggling Los Angeles actor Veronica finds herself simultaneously falling in love with a sensitive writer named Abel and an air- headed drummer named Zed, she initially tries to see them both without the other finding out, and then to choose between them. When she is unable to do so, she begins openly dating them both, and the three eventually move in together, forming a unique yet functional group relationship. Veronica's friend Mike is critical of their relationship, though she warms to the concept over time. Abel and Zed are initially antagonistic to one another but grow closer over time, eventually becoming closer to one another than either of them are to Veronica. When Veronica becomes pregnant, the relationship becomes strained and she eventually leaves both Abel and Zed for charming director Ernest, whom she agrees to marry despite not loving. At the film's climax, Abel and Zed race across the city at Mike's urging to stop the wedding and win her back.

He is also a failure as an inventor. He lives with his wife (Carla Gugino), daughter, and a disabled grandmother. Jimmy's aspiration to succeed contrasts sharply with the numbness of his pothead friend Ray (Ethan Hawke), who is just trying to get by. When performing, Jimmy contradicts the role of a comedian and instead uses the stand-up form to relate the tragedies in his life, which causes indifferent to hostile reactions from the audience; however, he also provokes members of the audience. Eventually Jimmy is fired from his day job for stealing beer, which he abuses, and his wife leaves him. He winds up working at a Middle-Eastern fast-food restaurant.

Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 with a boundary increase that took place in 1992, Center Street features Victorian homes built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district is established between Town Creek and Vernon Avenue on the east side of Center Street and between the theater and Morgan Avenue on the west side. Once known as Huron Road, Center Street runs current with Ohio State Route 511 and Ohio State Route 60, which travels the entire length of Ohio. The Center Street Historic District Association is the homeowners' association for the district. From its inception, Center Street intended to be a street of significant homes. A June 22, 1859 Ashland Union article says: > But the ‚Äústar of empire‚Äù is establishing its head quarters [sic] in South > Ashland. The grading of the principal street under the direction of the > Supervisor, Mr. Hildebrand, has progressed sufficiently far to convince > every one [sic], that, when completed, and when the shade trees which, by > next year, will line both sides of the street, shall have had time to > accumulate a foliage, there will be no town or city in the State any portion > of which will present a more attractive appearance than that of Centre > street in South Ashland. Center Street fulfilled its potential, for prosperous businessmen, industrialists, bankers, politicians, and physicians built their significant homes on it. Since these homes were built between 1850 and 1920, a variety of architectural styles are represented. The view of these houses remains much the same as when most of the homes were completed. At one time almost all of the Center Street houses had fences with gates that were kept shut to keep out the swine that were allowed to roam the city and the cattle that were driven along the street. In 1860 Ashland passed a hog ordinance and a cow ordinance in 1867 to prevent these animals from wandering in town. During a city council meeting on April 30, 1894, R. M. Campbell petitioned to have Center Street paved with bricks from Main to Bank (now College Avenue) Streets. Although it was not the first brick paved street in Ashland, Center Street‚Äôs paving was accomplished four years before even Main Street was improved. Per Alta Sims, who was central to the street being listed on the Historic Register, ‚Äúthe Center Street Historic District is, in short, a veritable textbook in residential architecture.‚Äù Beginning at Town Creek, the houses on the west side of center street are as follows: * 220 Center Street The Carter - Shinn House, Queen Anne Architecture ** This house features a turret with a cone- shaped roof and a metal finial. ** It was built in 1893 by William Carter, who was in the lumber business. Later, his daughter, Louise, who was born in the house, lived here with her husband, T.

P. Smith, this house was the parsonage for the Congregational Church, which is across the street. * 312 Center Street The Benjamin Myers House, Queen Anne Architecture ** Dr. Benjamin Myers served in the Ohio General Assembly, as mayor of Ashland, and as a county probate judge. ** Currently serving as Dr. Starkey's Chiropractic Clinic * 414 Center Street The Cowan House, Colonial Revival Architecture ** Originally a simple brick structure, this house was expanded in 1905 using Colonial Revival style by P.A. Myers for his son, Guy and his wife, Kate More. ‚ÄúIt is remarkable for the fine detail of the frontispiece which matches that of the roof dormers of both the house and the carriage building.‚Äù ** Built by Dr. Jacob P. Cowan who married Mary Jane Hooker. Dr. Cowan was a physician, served in the Ohio General Assembly, and was a United States Representative in the 44th Congress for what was at the time the 14th district. ** Currently the home of the Ashland County Historical Society * 414 Center Street The Thornburg Carriage House, Colonial Revival Architecture ** Also part of the Ashland County Historical Society, home of the Thomas Thornburg Insect Collection * 432 Center Street The Wallack House, Queen Anne Architecture ** Built before 1874 by Eli W. Wallack, this house has a projecting portal and imbricated siding. When Veda Winbigler owned the house, she split off the back portion around 1926 and moved it to the rear of the lot. It was made into a house facing Walnut Street, which has been torn down. On May 8, 1946 the house was sold to the Red Cross who added rooms to the back of the house twice. ** Wallack was in business with J. W. Harman and then later with Randolph and Jonas Freer. Eventually he partnered with W. C. Frazee in a furniture store on Main Street. He served as treasurer for Montgomery Township. He was first married Anne Faws, who passed away in 1873 at the age of 39. He then married Caroline Campbell in 1876. ** Formerly the home of the American Red Cross of Ashland County, it now serves as the law office of Robert DeSanto * 508 Center Street The Philip A. Myers House, Italian Villa Architecture ** Built in 1915, by Philip Andrews Myers, this notable limestone and brick house includes an attached motor car garage. The front of this house is symmetrical with a central entrance topped with a third story dormer and one story bay windows on each side. ** P. A. Myers was married to Samantha Alice Chase. He was an inventor with over 100 patents whose first notable invention was the double- action force pump. P.A. Myers with his brother, Francis Myers, own largest industry in Ashland, F.E. Myers & Brothers, a pump and hay tool business. In 1880, P. A. Myers was the first in Ashland to have a telephone in his original home at 420 Center Street, which was razed. ** Currently incorporated into Trinity Lutheran Church * 602 Center Street The Frazee House, Italianate Architecture, Romano-Tuscan Mode ** Built in 1873 by William C. Frazee, this red brick house has a heavy, bracketed cornice, a low roof, and carved lintels above its windows. It features a porch with a projecting hood and an elaborately carved gablet roof. This house was considered \\"one of the most beautiful and attractive in the city.\\" ** Frazee, who married to Nancy Swineford, was a businessman who was elected Ashland County clerk of the court of common pleas.

It shortened the distance between London Paddington station and , and since 1906 has also formed part of the Reading to Taunton line for a shorter journey from London to . History GWR short cuts to the West Stert and Westbury marked \\"A\\" The Great Western Railway (GWR) had opened its main line between London Paddington and in 1841. It was extended westwards through and trains were running through to by 1867. Another route left the main line at Thingley Junction, west of , ran south to in 1848 and was extended to Weymouth in 1857. Both these lines carried trains connecting with ships ‚Äì from the Channel Islands at Weymouth, and from America at Plymouth ‚Äì but the GWR was sometimes referred to as the 'Great Way Round' as its routes to these places were longer than the rival London and South Western Railway. In 1895 the GWR started work on laying a second track on the Berks and Hants Extension Railway which was part of a route westwards from to , and on constructing the Stert and Westbury line that would connect the Berks and Hants line with Westbury. The new line was ready for goods traffic on 29 July 1900 and passenger trains started to use the line on 1 October. The new line was long and reduced the distance from Paddington to Westbury and Weymouth by . From 2 July 1906 the line was also carrying trains from Paddington to Penzance due to the opening of the Langport and Castle Cary Railway which shortened this journey by . Westbury station had been rebuilt in 1899 in preparation for the additional trains and two lines were added later to allow non-stop trains to avoid the congested station area. In 1933 a connection from the Stert line ran along a new route to the east of the station and rejoined the main line some distance to the west. Another connection was opened in 1942 to allow westbound trains from the Stert line to run directly to the north towards Chippenham or Bristol, one of many short connecting lines built around the network during World War II. The GWR was nationalised to become the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. Local passenger trains were withdrawn on the line on 18 April 1966 but it still forms an important link in the London to Penzance Line and carries freight traffic from the quarries in the Mendip Hills towards terminals in London and the South East. The 1942 curve at Westbury also allows it to be used as a diversionary route when the Great Western Main Line through is blocked. Stations Unless otherwise stated, all stations were open for passenger traffic from 29 July 1900 to 18 April 1966. The station buildings were constructed in brick and all stations had a covered footbridge to link the platforms (except Westbury where a subway was provided). Patney and Chirton When the Berks and Hants Extension Railway had opened in 1862 the nearest station to Patney had been at Woodborough. With the construction of the Stert line a new junction station was provided north of the village and it opened for passengers on 29 July 1900. Known initially as 'Patney Bridge', this was soon changed to avoid confusion with Putney Bridge station in London. Chirton is another village a short distance beyond Patney. The main building was on the westbound platform, from where a road led to the village. Opposite this was a double-sided platform with a smaller building; trains from Westbury used one face of the platform, and those to and from Devizes used the other. A signal box was situated west of the main platform and a small goods yard was located behind this but this was not in use until 1904. A military training exercise in 1909 prompted the building of a fourth platform. This 'military platform' was north of the main station and had its own access road. It was taken out of use in the 1950s. The goods yard closed on 19 May 1964 and the station was unstaffed from November 1965. The signal box closed in 1966, and the station was demolished soon after. Just the footbridge remains. Lavington This station was situated where the line passed close to Littleton Panell on an embankment but was named to reflect two larger communities: Market Lavington and West Lavington. The main building was on the westbound platform and a waiting room was built on the eastbound. The goods yard (in use from 29 July 1900) was at the southwest of the station and the West signal box was opposite. A second East signal box on the south side of the line was open from about 1903 to 1914, when it was removed to allow the platforms to be lengthened. The first signal box was retained for occasional use after the station closed until 1979. The goods yard closed on 3 April 1967 and a scrapyard now occupies the site. The largest engineering structure on the line is the brick viaduct at Lavington. Situated east of the station, it is long and up to high. Edington and Bratton Near the site of Edington and Bratton station The station at Edington opened for goods traffic on 29 July 1900, a month before passenger trains were allowed to use the line. The village of Bratton is about distant. A brick building containing the main facilities stood on the westbound platform and a waiting shelter was provided for passengers travelling eastwards. The goods shed was to the west of the main building. Passenger trains no longer called after 3 November 1952 and the buildings were demolished, but the goods shed and yard remained open for traffic until 25 March 1963. The site is now an industrial estate. Westbury Westbury station was rebuilt in 1899 ready for the new line. The station at Westbury opened on 5 September 1848 as the terminus of a line from . Lines continued to both and and were all served by the same small station with a wooden train shed covering the platforms. In 1899 it was rebuilt with two platforms, each served by two tracks. The station offices were at road level on the east side of the station, and access to the platforms was by a subway at the same level. In 1984 the easternmost track was taken out of passenger use but in 2013 the Swindon and Wiltshire Local Transport Body prioritised its reopening at an estimated cost of ¬£5.4m. Although the locomotive sheds have long gone, the station remains a busy junction with extensive goods yards. A signal box north of the station was opened in 1984 and controls the whole of the Westbury area and of the main line from east of Lavington as far as .

Wolf (n√©e Dapkus; December 5, 1923 ‚Äì June 6, 2011) was a center fielder and pitcher who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Women in baseball In February 1943, Philip K. Wrigley founded the All-American Girls League. Wrigley, a chewing gum manufacturer and owner of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, materialized his idea as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the World War II military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. Ann Harnett became the first girl to sign with the All- American, being followed by Claire Schillace, Edythe Perlick and Shirley Jameson. Early life Dapkus was born to a Lithuanian family and was raised in Chicago, Illinois. She was the tenth child in her family and the first girl after nine boys. Athletically inclined, she started playing sports with her brothers at a very young age. The only sports she did not participate in were tennis and swimming. Baseball came naturally, but most of the time she played softball, mostly in the streets or in the prairies. She attended Christian Fenger Academy High School in Chicago and played every sport available to girls, but they were all of the playground variety, not varsity competition. Over the years, she earned twenty five medals in several sports, including softball, volleyball, basketball and soccer. AAGPBL career The first AAGPBL spring training was set for May 17, 1943, at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball, the league created a hybrid game which included both softball and baseball. Wrigley had scouts all over the United States, Canada and even Cuba signing girls for tryouts. About 500 girls attended the call. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final try-outs in Chicago where 60 were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. The league started with four teams, and each team was made up of fifteen girls. Dapkus survived the final cut and was assigned to the Racine Belles team, where she played for eight seasons. Dapkus earned the nickname Slugger for her power hitting abilities, helping Racine to clinch the league championship in both 1943 and 1946. She was chosen as the fourth outfielder for the 1943 All-Star team after leading the league with 10 home runs. The 1943 All-Star Game was the first night game played at Wrigley Field (July 1, 1943). In 1944, Dapkus paced the circuit with 10 doubles. For the 1946 team, she hit .253 and drove in 57 runs while tying for the league lead with nine triples. In 1948 the Belles decided to move her to the pitching mound, and she responded with a 24-9 mark as an overhand pitcher. But at the end of 1950 the Belles lacked the financial resources to keep the club playing in Racine, Wisconsin. Before the 1951 season, when the team moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, Dapkus, along with original Belles Maddy English, Edythe Perlick and Joanne Winter, were disappointment and decided not to make the move. During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, always like a family away from home. Dapkus and teammates thought that all would be different, like a new team, maybe a new manager and, specially, a new location. Overall, Dapkus hit .229 with 30 home runs and 317 runs batted in 775 games, and posted a 53-34 record with 397 strikeouts and a 1.97 earned run average in 102 pitching appearances. She is seventh lifetime in home runs and ranks eleventh in runs batted in. Life after baseball Both before and after she joined the AAGPBL, Dapkus worked in a variety of jobs. Most of her early work was clerical except for during World War II when she spraypainted airplane parts at the Pullman Aircraft factory. Following her playing retirement, she went back to Chicago. She married in 1950, changed her name to Eleanor Dapkus Wolf and had two sons, Frank and Richard. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York since November 5, that honors those who were part of this unique experience. But like many of her AAGPBL colleagues, Dapkus was relatively unknown until the 1992 film A League of Their Own by filmmaker Penny Marshall was exhibited for the first time. Slugger Eleanor was a longtime resident of St. John, Indiana, where she died at the age of 87, following complications from breast cancer.

He is best known as the founder of Morgan Yachts. Early life Morgan was born in Chicago in 1929 and raised in Florida. When he was 17, Morgan built the yacht Brisote and completed a St. Petersburg, Florida to Havana, Cuba race with Bruce Bidwell. Morgan attended the University of Tampa and took a job with Johnson Sails, located at the Jean Street Shipyard on the Hillsborough River. In 1952 he founded Morgan Racing Sails in Tampa, FL. While making sails Morgan met yacht designer George Luzier, who got him interested in designing boats. Racing In 1957, Morgan, along with Charlie Hunt, designed and built Brisote, a 31-foot plywood yawl. After successfully appealing disqualification due to a lack of engine, he entered the Havana race and took second in Brisote's division. In 1960 Jack Powell commissioned Morgan to build the 40 foot centerboard fiberglass yawl Paper Tiger.. The \\"famously successful\\" Paper Tiger won the SORC Southern Ocean Racing Conference in 1961 and 1962. Morgan Yachts Unable to find a builder to manufacture the Tiger Cub, a smaller version of Paper Tiger, Morgan founded the Morgan Yacht Corporation St. Petersburg, FL, 1965 after graduating high school and starting his own sail company. Morgan suffered the misfortune of falling ill with tuberculosis, delaying production. Morgan asked Bidwell to join the business, delivering the first yacht in 1965. Early models included the Tiger Cub and fiberglass sloop Morgan 34. The company grossed 1.7 million in 1965. The company's first model was the Morgan 34 built in fiberglass. This was followed by the Morgan 24, 30, 41, and 45. The Morgan 41 designed by Morgan, his most popular design, became a standard in the sailing charter industry for its strength, simplicity, and space belowdecks. In response to customer feedback while operating Morgan Yacht, Morgan designed the shallow draft Morgan Out Island 41, \\"the most popular boat over 40 feet overall ever built.\\" First built in 1971 the spacious boat became popular with charter companies, becoming \\"the standard charter boat.\\" Morgan's involvement in the company ended in 1972. Ownership of Morgan Yacht was sold to Beatrice Foods in 1968, providing funds for Morgan to design and build the wooden 12-meter yacht Heritage to compete for selection as defender of the America's Cup. Morgan acted as skipper during the defender selection trials but lost to Intrepid. After Morgan left the company was passed from one corporate entity to another, until it came into the hands of Catalina Yachts in 1984. Catalina continued manufacturing a few models, including the Out Island 41, before the Morgan name was retired. Later life Morgan left Morgan Yachts in 1972. Beatrice Foods sold the company to Catalina Yachts in 1984 and sold a redesigned Morgan Out Island 41 from 1986 to 1993. Morgan found Heritage Yacht Corporation in 1975, producing trawlers and sailing yachts. The company was forced into bankruptcy and ownership transferred to Catalina Yachts. He later worked for Chris-Craft, doing design work on their trawler line. Morgan later designed the Com-pac 35 under contract for Hutchins Yachts.
