WattzOn’s History WattzOn was started as a free web-based online tool by Saul Griffith, Raffi Krikorian, and Jim McBride. The original offering allowed users to calculate their total energy footprint by estimating their direct and indirect power consumption with the stated goal of educating users about energy efficiency and conservation. Unlike most carbon calculators, WattzOn has always measured energy consumption, and not the by-products (CO2, or CO2-equivalent emissions). The original idea behind WattzOn was first spoken about by Saul Griffith and Jim McBride in a presentation entitled \\"The Game Plan: A solution framework for the climate challenge.\\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WattzOn_Game_Plan.pdf delivered at O'Reilly's Foo Camp and later detailed at length in Griffith's Long Now talk entitled Climate Change Recalculated.http://fora.tv/2009/01/16/Saul_Griffith_Climate_Change_Recalculated From there, Raffi Krikorian spearheaded the effort to create an online tool that anybody could use to measure his or her level of energy efficiency. That website became WattzOn.com. In 2011 WattzOn combined with EnnovationZ Inc, a company founded by Martha Amram and Steven Ashby. Since then Martha has led WattzOn. WattzOn was the recipient of a grant from the Department of Energy to bring consumers insights from smart meters. In partnership with Balfour Beatty, WattzOn served military families, and helped them save an average of 18% on their utility bill at 12 locations.

All of his victims were 10 to 14 years old, most of them boys. Mansour was arrested in 2006 along with his six accomplices, and subsequently sentenced to death. Crimes Mansour left his home in Tanta, a town north of Cairo, and joined a street gang at an early age. Gang leaders taught him skills of survival, allegedly cutting him with razors when he made any mistakes. According to his confession, Mansour soon learned the method of getting back at those who crossed him by raping them, and murdered anyone who threatened to go to the police afterwards. One of the victims, 12-year-old boy Ahmed Nagui, had been a member of Mansour's gang. When Mansour tried to sexually assault him, Nagui reported him to the police, and Mansour was arrested but was released for lack of evidence. Soon after Mansour raped and murdered Nagui in retaliation, according to the prosecutors. Mansour frequently traveled between Cairo and Alexandria by train. He felt safer in Alexandria because it had fewer police officers. The Vice Department of Borg El-Arab police station in Alexandria started keeping a profile on him during this time. Mansour and his gang members lured street children onto the carriage roof of the trains, where they then stripped, raped and tortured them, and tossed them naked onto the trackside, dead or barely alive. Some of the children were dumped into the Nile, or buried alive. Mansour and his gang's crimes came to light in 2006 when two of his gang members were arrested, and Mansour acquired the nickname \\"al-Tourbini\\" meaning \\"Express Train\\", from his favorite location for the crimes. After the arrest, Mansour reportedly told prosecutors that he was possessed by a female jinn who commanded him to commit the crimes. Mansour, along with his accomplice Farag Samir Mahmoud, also known as \\"Hanata\\", were convicted and sentenced to death by the criminal court in Tanta in 2007. Mansour and Mahmoud were both executed by hanging on Thursday, December 16, 2010. Commercialization of the name Soon after the arrest, al-Ahram, a widely circulated Egyptian newspaper, reported that some products in Egypt were being named after Mansour's nickname, \\"al-Tourbini\\". Several restaurants in Mansour's hometown, Tanta, started selling a so-called \\"al-Tourbini sandwich\\", allegedly in demand by young locals. Sheep merchants gave the name \\"al-Tourbini\\" to the large-size lamb priced at more than 2,000 Egyptian pound. Some tuk-tuk drivers named their vehicles \\"al-Tourbini\\" to attract customers. According to al-Ahram, the \\"strangest such marketing ploy\\" was that of owners of supermarkets and communications centers in Tanta were renaming their businesses \\"al-Tourbini: The Butcher of Gharbia\\". Author and journalist John R. Bradley commented in his book Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution that \\"this reaction borders on the incomprehensible, but what it clearly indicates is that something has gone terribly wrong with contemporary Egyptian society.\\" References 1980s births 2010 deaths Egyptian people convicted of murder Egyptian prisoners sentenced to death Egyptian rapists Egyptian serial killers Egyptian murderers of children Gang members Male serial killers People from Tanta Violence against men in Africa 2000s murders in Egypt 2006 murders in Africa 2006 crimes in Egypt Executed serial killers 21st-century executions by Egypt People executed by Egypt by hanging ","title":"Ramadan Abdel Rehim Mansour"},{"id":"21223716","text":"Tatenectes is a genus of cryptoclidid plesiosaur known from the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming. Its remains were recovered from the Redwater Shale Member of the Sundance Formation, and initially described as a new species of Cimoliosaurus by Wilbur C. Knight in 1900. It was reassigned to Tricleidus by Maurice G. Mehl in 1912 before being given its own genus by O'Keefe and Wahl in 2003. Tatenectes laramiensis is the type and only species of Tatenectes. While the original specimen was lost, subsequent discoveries have revealed that Tatenectes was a very unusual plesiosaur. Its torso had a flattened, boxy cross-section and its gastralia (belly ribs) exhibit pachyostosis (thickening). The total length of Tatenectes has been estimated at . Tatenectes is related to Kimmerosaurus, although their taxonomic placement has varied. They were once considered to be close relatives of Aristonectes in the family Cimoliasauridae or Aristonectidae, but later assigned to Cryptoclididae. The unusual body shape and pachyostotic gastralia of Tatenectes would have helped to make it more stable and resistant to turbulence. Based on stomach contents, Tatenectes fed on cephalopods and fish. It would have lived in the shallow waters of the Sundance Sea, an epicontinental sea covering much of North America during part of the Jurassic. Tatenectes shared its habitat with invertebrates, fish, ichthyosaurs, and other plesiosaurs, including another cryptoclidid, Pantosaurus, and the large pliosaurid Megalneusaurus. History of study Illustration of the proximal phalanges of the holotype from Knight's description (leftmost drawing depicts a cross-section) All known specimens of Tatenectes come from the Redwater Shale Member in the upper part of the Sundance Formation . This formation is located in Wyoming, in the Eastern Rocky Mountains. An incomplete plesiosaur skeleton preserving multitudinous vertebrae and a nearly complete forelimb from the Sundance Formation was described by Wilbur C. Knight in 1900. With this specimen as a holotype, which was never assigned a specimen number, he named a new species of Cimoliosaurus, C. laramiensis. In 1912, Maurice G. Mehl questioned the assignment of C. laramiensis to Cimoliosaurus, noting that Cimoliosaurus was a catch-all, and that since this genus was named based on vertebrae, the vertebrae of C. laramiensis would have to be similar to those of the type species, C. magnus. He was unable to find such similarities, and provisionally reclassified C. laramiensis as a species of Tricleidus, due to the anatomy of its forelimbs. Although the holotype specimen of T. laramiensis has since been lost, Knight's description of the specimen was sufficient to determine that T. laramiensis is a valid species. In 2003, F. Robin O'Keefe and William Wahl, JR. referred another specimen housed at the Tate Museum to this species. This specimen, listed under the specimen numbers UW 15943 and UW 24801, consists of vertebrae, ribs, a shoulder girdle, a partial forelimb, and a fragmentary skull and was assigned as a neotype. Additionally, O'Keefe and Wahl noted that the shoulder girdle of this species was quite different from that of Tricleidus, so they named a new genus, Tatenectes, to include T. laramiensis. The name Tatenectes is derived from that of the Tate Museum and the Greek word Nectes, meaning \\"diver.\\" O'Keefe and Hallie P. Street assigned more material to Tatenectes laramiensis in 2009, including UW 24215, a partial skeleton including further cranial, vertebral, pectoral, and phalangeal elements. Another skeleton, USNM 536976, was assigned to this species by O'Keefe and colleagues in 2011. This specimen preserved 22 vertebrae, ribs, gastralia, and complete pelves. Description Size comparison Tatenectes is a small plesiosaur, a group of marine reptiles well adapted to aquatic life. Tatenectes is a \\"plesiosauromorph,\\" meaning that it would have had an elongated neck, small head, and longer humeri than femora, as opposed to the short necks and large skulls and femora of \\"pliosauromorphs.\\" In 1900, Knight estimated that Tatenectes was probably less than . O'Keefe and Street later estimated a smaller total length of around in 2010, although O'Keefe and colleagues gave a maximum length of a year later. The overall shape of Tatenectes is very unusual among plesiosaurs, with the body being flattened and rather short back-to-front. The squamosals, bones located at the rear of the skull, are tall, three-pronged elements which form an arch over the back face of the skull. This structure, the squamosal arch, is an identifying plesiosaurian trait. There is an opening between the pterygoids (bones that form part of the palate) known as the anterior interpterygoid vacuity. Posterior to this opening, the pterygoids thicken and project downwards. When the skull is viewed from below, the parasphenoid (a bone located between the palate and braincase) is obscured by other bones. This palatal configuration is a distinctive characteristic of Tatenectes. Another such trait is the shape of its teeth, which were small and thin, bearing elongated roots and low enamel ridges. The total number of cervical (neck) vertebrae in Tatenectes is unknown. The neural spines of these vertebrae are short and angled posteriorly. Many features of the cervical vertebrae can be used to identify this genus: the cervical centra (vertebral bodies) are considerably shorter (in length) than wide, and are not constricted in the middle; the articulations for the cervical ribs are short but pronounced; the articular faces of the cervical vertebrae are round and weakly defined; the subcentral foramina (two small openings on the underside of the centrum) of the cervical vertebrae are positioned further apart than typical in related plesiosaurs. The form of the torso in Tatenectes is very distinctive. Flattened and spheroid in shape, the torso has a somewhat boxy cross-section. There are sixteen dorsal (back) vertebrae in Tatenectes, which, when articulated, form a considerably flatter arch than seen in related taxa. The dorsal neural spines are inclined anteriorly. The dorsal ribs articulate with the vertebrae horizontally and are deflected backwards, contributing to the flatness of the body. The gastralia (belly ribs) Tatenectes are unusually large for its size that exhibit pachyostosis (thickening). The medial (midline) gastralia are relatively straight, while the lateral (outer) gastralia are strongly \\"J\\"-shaped. Tatenectes bears four sacral (hip) vertebrae, which are smaller than the dorsal vertebrae. The centra of the caudal (tail) vertebrae are anteroposteriorly short. All of the vertebrae have amphicoelous centra (bearing concave articular faces). Reconstructed pelvis The morphology of the medial process of the scapula of Tatenectes is diagnostic of this genus. These processes are anteroposteriorly short, with the posterior ends of each process contacting the other along the midline and a notch separating their anterior ends. The top of this notch is overlain by a distinctive clavicle, which is flat and simple in morphology. The pectoral fenestra (an opening enclosed by the scapula and coracoid) is rounded and enlarged. The posterior region of the coracoid is much thinner than the rest of the pectoral girdle. The humerus has a slender, elongated shaft and is another bone with a distinctive shape. The surfaces of the humerus that articulated with the lower arm bones (radius and ulna) have roughly equal lengths. The humerus also bears articulations that indicate there were two additional bones in the lower arm. Tatenectes had six carpals (wrist bones). The metacarpals and proximal phalanges are mildly flattened, with a groove on each side of their top surfaces, while the distal phalanges are flattened more strongly. The pelvic girdle of Tatenectes is wider than long and has a flatter bottom surface than typical among plesiosaurs, making it short top-to-bottom. Each pubic bone is flat and plate- like, with a notch on its front rim forming a projection known as an anterolateral horn. The ischium is more robust where it forms the acetabulum, thinning posteriorly. The straight, gracile ilium forms an acute angle with the ischium when viewed from the side, yet another identifying characteristic. Classification Life restoration Tatenectes has had a complicated taxonomic history. While it had previously been considered a species of Cimoliasaurus or Tricleidus, O'Keefe and Wahl found it to be the sister taxon of Kimmerosaurus in 2001. These two genera, as well as Aristonectes, were considered to be part of Cimoliasauridae, with Kaiwhekea being either a member of this family or its closest known relative. In 2009, O'Keefe and Street considered that utilizing the name \\"Cimoliasauridae\\" for this group was a poor choice since they found Cimoliasaurus to actually belong to a different group, Elasmosauridae. The group containing Tatenectes, Kimmerosaurus, Aristonectes, and Kaiwhekea was subsequently named Aristonectidae. However, in 2011, O'Keefe and colleagues noted the problematic nature of Aristonectes and Kaiwhekea. Due to their unusual morphology, these two genera are difficult to classify, making their relation to Tatenectes ambiguous. Further studies have recovered Tatenectes as a member of Cryptoclididae, where it is still found to be a close relative of Kimmerosaurus, in addition to Cryptoclidus. Aristonectes and Kaiwhekea, however, are now thought to be derived elasmosaurids known as aristonectines. The following cladogram follows that of Roberts and colleagues, 2020. Mounted skeleton of Cryptoclidus, another cryptoclidid Paleobiology Pachyostosis, as seen in Tatenectes, is unusual among plesiosaurs, and only a handful of genera, such as Pachycostasaurus, exhibit it. While many skeletal elements of Pachycostasaurus are pachyostoic, Tatenectes is even more unusual in that the gastralia are the only pachyostotic bones, the dorsal ribs being unmodified. Pachyostosis describes the thickening of a bone's periosteal cortex, thereby making the bone larger, and often occurs with osteosclerosis, or increased bone density. Conversely, an animal's bone density can be decreased through osteoporosis. Despite its gastralia being pachyostotic, Tatenectes does not exhibit osteosclerosis, but it does have a layer of osteoporotic bone between the layers of pachyostotic bone, an unprecedented condition. The pachyostotic bone is concentrated around the midline of the ventral thorax. This, together with the unusually flat body shape, led O'Keefe and colleagues to hypothesize that Tatenectes would have been more resistant to turbulence, particularly roll, than other plesiosaurs, increasing its stability when swimming close to the surface in shallow water. In addition to pachyostosis, lung deflation could also have been used by Tatenectes (and other plesiosaurs) to gain negative buoyancy, helping it dive. Plesiosaurs swallowed stones known as gastroliths. While it has been proposed that these could have been used for ballast or buoyancy control, the effectiveness of this is controversial. The stones may have had a digestive function, or their ingestion may have been accidental. It is also possible, although more controversial, that gastroliths were used for other purposes such as alleviation of discomfort or mineral supplements. Additionally, gastroliths may have had a variety of functions instead of being limited to just one. Stomach contents of Tatenectes include the hooklets of coleoid cephalopod and teeth and denticles from a small hybodont shark, indicating that Tatenectes fed on these animals. These prey items show that Tatenectes was not a bottom feeder, unlike some elasmosaurids as indicated by their stomach contents. Paleoenvironment Belemnites like this Pachyteuthis would have been an important food source for the marine reptiles of the Sundance Formation Tatenectes comes from the Oxfordian-aged (Upper Jurassic) rocks of the Redwater Shale Member of the Sundance Formation. This member is about thick. While mainly composed of grayish green shale, it also has layers of yellow limestone and sandstone, the former layers containing plentiful fossils of marine life. The Sundance Formation represents a shallow epicontinental sea known as the Sundance Sea. From the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada, where it was connected to the open ocean, this sea spanned inland southwards to New Mexico and eastward to the Dakotas. When Tatenectes was alive, most of the Sundance Sea was less than deep. Based on δ18O isotope ratios in belemnite fossils, the temperature in the Sundance Sea would have been below and above the thermocline. The paleobiota of the Sundance Formation includes foraminiferans and algae, in addition to a variety of animals. Many invertebrates are known from the Sundance Formation, represented by crinoids, echinoids, serpulid worms, ostracods, malacostracans, and mollusks. The mollusks include cephalopods such as ammonites and belemnites, bivalves such as oysters and scallops, and gastropods. Fish from the formation are represented by hybodont and neoselachian chondrichthyans as well as teleosts (including Pholidophorus). Marine reptiles are uncommon, but are represented by four species. Plesiosaurs, in addition to Tatenectes, include another cryptoclidid, Pantosaurus striatus, as well as the large pliosaurid Megalneusaurus rex. Besides plesiosaurs, marine reptiles are also represented by the ichthyosaur Ophthalmosaurus (or, possibly, Baptanodon) natans, the most abundant marine reptile of the Sundance Formation.

Description The type species, P. dawni, is represented by a single near complete specimen (PETMG R338) which was approximately 3.1 metres in length. It had a robust barrel shaped torso, a relatively short neck and small flippers, indicating that it was not an agile swimmer.A. R. I. Cruickshank, D. M. Martill, and L. F. Noe. 1996. A pliosaur (Reptilia, Sauropterygia) exhibiting pachyostosis from the Middle Jurassic of England. Journal of the Geological Society of London 153:873-879 Reconstruction The holotypic specimen possessed five stout and conical tooth pairs on the mandibular symphysis (the length of which is a clear characteristic of the genus in comparison to other contemporary Pliosaurids such as Simolestes and Liopleurodon). Its head was about 20% of overall body length, small for most Pliosaurids. The specimen had a cervical vertebral count of at least 13, these vertebrae having shortened centra and an enlarged neural canal, which were not heavily ossified except in the region of the neural spine (the neural spines themselves were not fused to the centra, which suggests that the specimen was not fully grown; however, this could also be a Paedomorphic trait.Araujo, Ricardo. (2015). New aristonectine elasmosaurid plesiosaur specimens from the Early Maastrichtian of Angola and comments on paedomorphism in plesiosaurs. Geologie en Mijnbouw. FirstView. 10.1017/njg.2014.43.) The cervical ribs were shortened and thickened, as well as double headed. The pectoral centra of the specimen are triangular in outline, and the dorsal vertebral centra are heavily ossified, with indistinct subcentral foramina and flat anterior and posterior faces. The anterior and posterior Zygapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae are reduced, however the neural spines thickened, with midline anterior and posterior excavations. The dorsal ribs, as well as the gastralia, are thickened and pachyostotic (a characteristic of the genus) with concave heads, a round cross-section and a ‘sausage-like’ profile. Based on histological sections taken of the pachyostotic elements, it was determined that the bones are osteosclerotic as well (combined, represents the condition pachyosteosclerosis). This is one of the main characteristics of the genus. It has been suggested that even though the holotypic individual appears to be a juvenile or sub-adult, its age is probably not solely responsible for these unusual bone structures.Street, Hallie P. \\"A study of the morphology of Tatenectes laramiensis, a cryptocleidoid plesiosaur from the Sundance Formation (Wyoming, USA).\\" (2009). The humeri of Pachycostasaurus are short, small compared to its body size, and lightly constructed. Palaeobiology Pachycostasaurus was most probably a benthic predator (it possessed sharp, robust, conical teeth, circular in cross-section and heavily striated, but lacking prominent carinae). The relative size and shape of the teeth Indicate a diet ranging from soft teuthoids, such as belemnites, to bony fish, and perhaps some of the larger reptiles. Pachycostasaurus has a lightly constructed skull, a short, rather weak jaw symphysis, and ventral ballast for stability which would have resisted roll. Thus it is doubtful if Pachycostasaurus was a twist feeder like other contemporary pliosaurids. Cruickshank et al. suggested that the rarity of the animal in the formation may suggest that Pachycostasaurus was allochthonous, its normal habitat being a coastal or even fresh water environment, or on the other hand a deep water environment. Pachycostasaurus was probably important in its food chain, as it would have transferred resources from the benthic food web to the surface food web as it came up to breathe.

The French Reformer John Calvin (1509–1564) was a theological writer who produced many sermons, biblical commentaries, letters, theological treatises, and other works. Although nearly all of Calvin's adult life was spent in Geneva (1536–38 and 1541–64), his publications spread his ideas of a properly reformed church to many parts of Europe and from there to the rest of the world. It is especially on account of his voluminous publications that he exerts such a lasting influence over Christianity and Western history. Calvin's first published work was an edition of the Roman philosopher Seneca's De Clementia, accompanied by a commentary demonstrating a thorough knowledge of antiquity. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by Christians whom Calvin called \\"Anabaptists.\\" He finished it in 1534 but, on the advice of friends, didn't publish it until 1542. The work demonstrates that since his conversion, Calvin had undertaken serious study and now showed a mastery of the Bible, and he had become, using Karl Barth's words, a \\"theological Humanist\\" and a \\"biblicist\\"  that is, \\"no matter how true a teaching might be, he was not ready to lend an ear to it apart from the Word of God.\\" At the age of twenty-six, Calvin published the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion (Latin title: Institutio Christianae Religionis), a seminal work in Christian theology that is still read by theological students today.\\"John Calvin\\" from \\"131 Christians everyone should know\\" in Christian History & Biography It was published in Latin in 1536 and in his native French in 1541, with the definitive editions appearing in 1559 (Latin) and in 1560 (French). The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant faith for those with some learning already and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of church and sacraments to justification by faith alone and Christian liberty, and it vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered unorthodox, particularly Roman Catholicism to which Calvin says he had been \\"strongly devoted\\" before his conversion to Protestantism. The overarching theme of the book - and Calvin's greatest theological legacy - is the idea of God's total sovereignty, particularly in salvation and election. Calvin also produced many volumes of commentary on most of the books of the Bible. For the Old Testament, he published commentaries for all books except the histories after Joshua (though he did publish his sermons on First Samuel) and the Wisdom literature other than the Book of Psalms. For the New Testament, he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation. These commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years. Calvin also wrote more than 1,300 letters on a wide range of topics. Institutes of the Christian Religion The title page from the 1834 edition of John Calvin's Institutio Christiane Religionis Calvin developed his theology, the most enduring component of his thought, in his biblical commentaries as well as his sermons and treatises, and he gave the most concise expression of his views on Christian theology in his magnum opus, the Institutes of the Christian Religion.See:  The various editions of that work span nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death.See:  *Hesselink, pp. 75–77. The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's Loci Communes. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the Institutes appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.See: *Parker (1995), pp. 4–10.   Commentaries Calvin produced commentaries on most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. However, it took six years before he wrote his second, a commentary on I Corinthians. He did not lose any more time in reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then turned his attention on the general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he did omit only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he would re-work for publication. However, from 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.See: *De Greef (2004), pp. 44–45. *Parker (2006), pp. 134–136, 160–162. In the controversial matter of interpreting prophecy such as that in the Book of Daniel, Calvin proposed a preterist view, which is to say that he believed that the prophecies in the book of Daniel apply only to the history between prophet Daniel (530 BC) and Jesus' first coming (30 AD). In this view he was out of line with the early church and the Reformers who came before him, who maintained more fully to historical-continuous view. Calvin is also in distinction to many of his later successors who look a future fulfillment. Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius, after whom the anti-Calvinistic movement Arminianism was named, says with regard to the value of Calvin's writings: :Next to the study of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 1551-1608); for I affirm that he excels beyond comparison in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued than all that is handed down to us by the library of the fathers; so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of prophecy. His Institutes ought to be studied after the (Heidelberg) Catechism, as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men. These commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years. Letters Letter of Calvin to king Edward VI of England, July 4, 1552 – British Museum Calvin's body of letters has not received the wide readership of the Institutes and bible commentaries since his correspondence obviously addressed the particular needs and occasions of his day. Even so, the scale of his letter writing was just as prodigious as his better-known works: his letters number some 1,300, and, along with some 3,000 letters written to him, fill eleven of Calvin's fifty-nine volumes in the Corpus Reformatorum.* B. B. Warfield calls Calvin \\"the great letter-writer of the Reformation age.\\"B.B. Warfield, Calvin and Augustine. The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 1956. p. 14.

They also reveal personal qualities that are not evident in his exegetical prose. One example came after the massacre of the Waldensians of Provence in 1545 where 3,600 were slaughtered. Calvin was so dismayed that in a space of twenty-one days he visited Berne, Aurich, Schaffhausen, Basle, and Strasbourg, before addressing the deputies of the Cantons at the Diet of Arau, pleading everywhere for an intercession on behalf of those who survived. He wrote of his grief to William Farel: :Such was the savage cruelty of the persecutors, that neither young girls, nor pregnant women, nor infants were spared. So great is the atrocious cruelty of this proceeding, that I grow bewildered when I reflect upon it. How, then, shall I express it in words? ... I write, worn out with sadness, and not without tears, which so burst forth, that every now and then they interrupt my words. One of Calvin's better known letters was his reply to Jacopo Sadoleto's \\"Letter to the Genevans,\\"Both letters can be found in Calvin's Tracts Relating to the Reformation (pp. 3–24, 25–71), translated by H.

She was the youngest child of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife, Margaret of Brabant. Her two siblings were John of Luxembourg and Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France. Life At the time of his death (1313), Emperor Henry VII initiated the negotiations for a marriage between Beatrice and Charles, Duke of Calabria, son and heir of King Robert of Naples, and also planned to marry again (his wife was already dead in 1311) with Catherine of Habsburg. Beatrice was called by her father to Italy, where she arrived with her paternal grandmother, Beatrice d'Avesnes. The marriage plans with the Duke of Calabria failed, and the Emperor began negotiations for a marriage with Prince Peter of Sicily, eldest son and heir of King Frederick III; however, the current political conflicts between the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily soon ended this planned betrothal too. When King Charles I of Hungary (whose first wife Maria of Bytom, had died in 1317) decided to marry again, he sent to the Kingdom of Bohemia two representants, Thomas Szécsényi and Simon Kacsics, in addition to an interpreter, a bourgeois from Szoprońskim called Stephen, in order to find a bride. King John called his two sisters to his court; at that moment, Marie resided in St. Marienthal Abbey and Beatrice remained in Italy. Both princesses arrived to Prague on 20 June 1318, and three days later, the Hungarian envoys met both girls at the monastery of Zbraslav, where the Bohemian king gave them the opportunity to choose between them their future queen. After a calculated assessment of both personal and physical attitudes, they chose Beatrice. Soon after, the formal engagement took place, and the young bride parted with the Hungarian entourage to her new home. On the border of the Kingdom of Hungary she was officially welcomed by Charles I's messengers. Beatrice and Charles I married at the Octave of Saint Martin (between 12 and 17 November) and she was crowned Queen of Hungary in the ceremony. Beatrice became pregnant in 1319. In November, she went into labour but died while giving birth. The child was stillborn. She was buried at Nagyvárad Cathedral.

It was first published in 1997 and the English edition was published in 2001. Overview The authors researched the book by living in Bhopal for three years in the late 1990s. They interviewed people from India and United States, who were witnesses and participants. The book starts by following a group of rural immigrants who traveled to Bhopal to escape the drought in their own villages and settled in the slums. The books also chronicles the invention of American firm Union Carbide's chemical pesticide, Sevin, which used methyl isocyanate and α-naphthol. The book details the disaster which killed between 15000 and 30000. The narration follows characters like Padmini, an Oriya girl, who was to be married the night of the disaster in the slums, and Sister Felicity, a missionary from Scotland. The book also describes other characters like a tradesman who hired tents to offer some protection against the poison cloud and the railway station warden who tried to stop a train from halting there. The final chapter follows the aftermath of the disaster. It tracks the people involved in the event, notably Warren Anderson, the chairman of Union Carbide at the time, and Warren Woomer, the supervisor of the factory in Bhopal. Film rights In September 2001, it was reported that director Oliver Stone was in negotiation with Dominique Lapierre for film rights to the book. Defamation lawsuit in India In July 2009, a Jabalpur court restrained the publication and sales of book in India, in an order directed at the authors and the local publishers of the book, Full Circle Publication. The order came after a former Director General of Police of Madhya Pradesh, Swaraj Puri, filed a defamation lawsuit for allegedly carrying defamatory remarks attributed to him. Puri was the Police Commissioner of Bhopal on the night of the disaster. In a joint statement, authors said the portions objected to by Puri had been substantiated by Moti Singh, who then the Collector of Bhopal and to whom Puri reported during the event, in his own 2008 book called Unfolding The Betrayal Of Bhopal Gas Tragedy. Puri's lawyer, Rajesh Pancholi, stated that a legal noticed had been sent to the authors in 2002. But added that the legal proceedings were delayed because the authors lived abroad. He said that initially a demand of million had been sent to the authors via email as compensation for the damage to Puri's reputation. Later, the sum was doubled because there was no response. He also said that Puri was more interested in a public apology than any monetary compensation. Pradeep Bakshi, the lawyer for Delhi-based Full Circle Publication, said that it was primarily a monetary issue. A spokesman from publishers denied that the book got any sales boost from the lawsuit, but alleged that the lawsuit was aimed to harass as it was filed in Jabalpur and their lawyer had to travel there. Another spokesman noted that Moti Singh's book was more damaging to Puri's reputation, yet no case was filed against him. On 8 October 2009, Madhya Pradesh High Court lifted the restrain order from the lower courts, after hearing a petition from the authors and publisher which stated that there was no derogatory content about Puri in the book.

He arrived in South India in 1740 to take charge of a small Tamil Lutheran congregation in Madras and expanded it during his stay. During his time in Madras he wrote several Christian hymns in Tamil and published the first Tamil to English Dictionary. Of his works his translation of the Bible to Tamil is considered to be most noteworthy. Early life Johann Philipp Fabricius was born on 22 January 1711 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.Mission Manual He graduated in both law and theology in Germany.Anderson, Gerald Ministry In 1740 Johann Philipp Fabricius arrived in South India to take charge of a small Tamil Lutheran congregation in Madras. After initial setbacks, the congregation grew from 300 to 2,200 members in his 30 years of ministry. Initially the foundations of dubashi infrastructure in South India were laid down by Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg. During the course of 1720 to 1849, around seventy-nine missionaries came to Tranquebar from Europe. Benjamin Schultze and Johann Philipp Fabricius were the most noteworthy among them. Fabricius was Schultze’s successor and worked in Vepery from 1740 to 1791.Frykenberg, Robert Eric. Literary contribution An important area of work started initially by Ziegenbalg and then later on taken up by Fabricius was Tamil Christian hymnody. Johann Philipp Fabricius published a collection of 335 Tamil hymns, most of them translated from German. The initial compositions by Ziegenbalg were not very well done and when Fabricius came to Madras he had this field of work entirely to himself and gained quite a mastery over this art. Even today hymns by Fabricius are sung by Christians in South India. In 1761, British East India Company forces invaded Pondicherry, which was then a French colony, and acquired a printing press. When the spoils of war were brought to Madras the printing press was passed on to Fabricius to aid his missionary work as well to be used for East India company's publication. Thus the first printing press in Madras was born under Fabricius in 1761. Initially Fabricius had problems with importing paper for his press from Europe, but the problem was sorted with Indians in Madras starting to manufacture their own paper leading to first paper industry in Madras.Prashant More,J.B. In 1779 he published the first Tamil to English dictionary containing 9000 headwords. This work laid the foundation for his future works in Tamil literature. It was published under the title \\"A Malabar and English dictionary, wherein the words and phrases of the Tamil Language, commonly called by Europeans the Malabar Language, are explained in English, By the English Missionaries of Madras. Printed at Wepery in the Year M.DCC.LXXIX.\\" Bible translation Ziegenbalg had left behind his translations of the Old and the New Testament during his stay in Madras. As he read through the translation along with Muttu, Fabricius realized that changes had to be made to Ziegenbalg’s translation. “The four qualities which Fabricius found in the originals were lucidity, strength, brevity and appropriateness; these were sadly lacking in the existing Tamil translation, but he hoped that by the help of God he had been able to restore them.”Neill,Stephen. In 1750 Fabricius finally completed his translation of the New Testament. He was a diligent worker and made sure that he read out his work to a lot of people in order to get their feedback and response. By 1753 translations of the first epistle of the Corinthians had already begun, much to Fabricius’ disappointment. The printing process was also in full sway. At this point Fabricius decided to go back to Tranquebar and work with his colleagues on the Corinthians and Galatians. Fabricius’ colleagues immediately realized the superiority of his work and decided to print his translation instead. They held the right to make corrections and suggestions whenever required. The New Testament which emerged from the Press in 1758 was a peculiar combination; the first seven books had no sign of influence of Fabricius while the rest of the work was entirely the translation done by him. At last in 1766, Fabricius could print his translation of the New Testament from a press that the British government made available to him. On 18 October 1756 Fabricius decided to focus his attention on the translation of the Old Testament. He recognized that this would be infinitely more difficult because of the Psalms, the Book of Solomon and prophets. During the process of translation, Fabricius had to face a lot of difficulty due to the lack of enough printing paper in Tranquebar. After much effort in 1756 a version of the Psalms was finally printed. However the final translation of the Old Testament was not printed until 1798, almost a decade after Fabricius' death. The Lutheran churches in South India used Fabricius' translation for a period of over 150 years. The poet Vedanayagam Sastriar paid tribute to this work by calling it “the golden translation of the immortal Fabricius.” Last days His last days in ministry were clouded by mismanagement of the mission, unsuccessful financial transactions among other failures. In 1778 the missionaries came to know that Fabricius had involved himself into quite a complex financial debt due to mismanagement of funds. Fabricius was imprisoned although his friends were allowed to visit him from time to time. At last Gericke, who had taken over his work, was able to secure a release for Fabricius, so that he could spend his last few days in peace. Johann Philipp Fabricius died on 23 January 1791 in Madras.

About the year 1200, Rupert, together with his brother Henry, began building Sonnenberg Castle on a spur of Spitzkippel peak in the Taunus above Wiesbaden. This was intended for protection against the Archbishop of Mainz and its vassals, the Lords of Eppstein, who held the lands bordering Wiesbaden. However, the cathedral chapter of St. Martin's Cathedral in Mainz claimed Sonnenberg as their own. To settle the dispute, Nassau paid 30 Marks to the cathedral chapter in 1221 to acquire the land of Sonnenberg Castle. They were also forced to recognize the sovereignty of the Archbishops of Mainz over Sonnenberg, taking the castle as a fief of Mainz.History of Sonnenberg , City of Wiesbaden website. .

All genealogies however state that the marriage took place \\"before 1221\\". to Gertrud († ca. 1222), possibly a daughter of the Count of Cleeberg. From this marriage no children are known.

Steff Gruber Life Steff Gruber is the son of the painter Hannes Gruber and Annemarie Gruber-Vogelsanger. He grew up in Oberrieden on Lake Zurich. In childhood his greatest ambition was to be a pilot and inventor. He constructed his first radio receiver at the age of eight; when he was fifteen, during the first manned space flight to the moon, he succeeded in listening in on the dialogue between the astronauts and ground control. He started to train as an electronics engineer, but abandoned the course before completing it after deciding that he wanted to become a film director. Up to the present day Steff Gruber has not settled on a choice of career. Instead he combines different professional identities, as an artist, technician and entrepreneur. He also continues to indulge his passion for flying, making round trips as a pilot in the Swiss Alps, as well as taxi and private flights within Europe and North Africa. Film Both during and after his time at the Juventus Gymnasium [higher secondary school] in Zurich, from 1972 on Gruber attended film lectures and courses given by Dr Martin Schlappner, Viktor Sidler, Georg Radanowicz and Sebastian C. Schröder at the University of Zurich, ETH Zürich [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich] and F+F, Schule für Gestaltung (Zürich) [F+F Zurich College of Design]. During his two-year course at the College of Design he studied with Doris Stauffer, Serge Stauffer, Hansjörg Mattmüller and Peter Jenny. On the side he worked as a commercial photographer and film maker. In 1974 Gruber studied Mass Media Philosophy for one year at the University of Georgia, where he made the acquaintance of the painter and film director James Herbert. His friendship with Herbert had a lasting effect on him, and remains an influence on his work to the present day. In the seventies Steff Gruber was one of the first film makers to work in the docudrama genre. He started work on his first long film, the docudrama Moon in Taurus, in Georgia in 1976. It was completed in 1980. The film is thematically focused on codes in relationships and the question why relationships break up. The original version included interviews with Cindy WilsonCindy Wilson im Casting zu Moon in Taurus on YouTube (The B-52's) and Silver Thin (Andy Warhol Factory); these were however omitted from the final cut. The unconventional form in which the film realised its aims brought it international acclaim. Based on selection from 15 hours of documentary materials, the film linked fiction and documentation in an original way. The film was nominated for an award at the Mannheimer Filmtage [Mannheim Film Festival]. Returning to Switzerland, for a short time he worked as assistant to the American painter Sam Francis, with whom he cooperated on a film about C.G. Jung. As a cameraman he worked for the artist Isa Hesse-Rabinovitch and the film maker Erich Langjahr. Gruber's second film, Fetish & Dreams, was also created in the USA. He started work on it in 1982. Filmed in New York City, it constitutes a formal and thematic sequel to the one preceding it. In his second long film Gruber also embarked on new paths in a technical sense. With the help of a method he developed himself, the film was first created electronically on video before being copied subsequently to 35 mm, making it the first video transfer in Swiss cinema. Fetish & Dreams was given its first showing in the Locarno International Film Festival competition, winning the prize 'for directorial originality in dealing with documentary and feature film elements'. The film has been shown at various film festivals worldwide. During the work of filming Gruber was introduced by his cameraman Rainer Klausmann to the German film director Werner Herzog. In 1987 the latter invited him to follow the filming work as his film Cobra Verde was created in Ghana. The result was the film Location Africa, which documents the filming work and last cooperative project of Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski. Between 1991 and 1995 Gruber was working on a new film, in which he aimed to investigate the erotic codes in interpersonal relationships. But after he had already filmed more than 120 hours' worth of materials, he felt his theme had been overtaken by media developments and so abandoned it. Thirteen years later, Secret Moments was completed after all. Created exclusively from the original film materials, this is a reflection on the project and the reasons for its initial failure. Between 2005 and 2011 Gruber worked on the documentary Passion Despair in Moldova. The film premiered at the Gdansk DocFilm Festival 2011. Gruber's new feature film Fire, Fire, Desire! is a love odyssey in Southeast Asia, which is inspired by Joseph Conrad's short novel Heart of Darkness (1899). As an author and director Gruber has spent several years working on each of his films – not just because he does practically everything himself, up to and including the design of the film poster, but because he has also been busy on the side with other projects. He has also taught since then at various schools and colleges. From 1994 to 1997, for example, he was a lecturer in Film and Electronic Media at Konstanz University of Applied Sciences. Photography Gruber has been involved with the subject of photography since 1970. During his time at the F+F Schule für Gestaltung, he worked not only as a filmmaker but also as a press photographer for Keystone Press. In 1977, Gruber examined new photographic techniques to fuse diapositives with instant images. He called this method diatypie. In his art projects SEXTOX.COM and webdesire.com in the 1990s, Gruber used so-called bots, or fully automated processes, to search the internet for sex images, which then became the subject of his art installations in modified form. Based on his interest in documentaries, Gruber began shooting photo stories in various countries that focused, in particular, on human interest subjects and humanist concerns. He produced many of his photo series over a period of several years, visiting places and people on repeated occasions. One of his long-term reports is the series about the floating villages of Lake Tonle Sap in Cambodia. As a publisher, Steff Gruber founded the independent, non-commercial magazine TOX, an open-format platform for photography and other artistic disciplines. The first edition of the magazine was dedicated to the Swiss artist and filmmaker Jürg Hassler, showcasing photographic work produced primarily during his time as a photographic reporter in Switzerland, France and Italy in the 1960s. Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Gruber founded the Lumiere.Gallery in April 2020 with the aim of offering photographers a platform through digital photo exhibitions. Internet Steff Gruber was a hacker of the first hour. As an internet pioneer, he was already surfing through cyberspace when it was still based on government, military and university computers. Through his Cultnet association, founded in 1980 for likeminded internet freaks, he was responsible for the birth of the very first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Switzerland.World Wide Web – eine „Schweizer“ Erfindung, Online PC Zeitung, Nr. 6, 2000. The first ‘Public Internet Dialup’, Cultnet.uucp (which later became cultnet.com and cult.net), was originally a service provided free of charge to registered users. The CULTNET e.V. Communication Society for Art & Science, for example, was aimed at establishing a communication medium for film creators in the form of a culture database. But at the time this digital service met with limited success. Thus for ten years Gruber was practically the only beneficiary of his own internet facility. Cultnet differed from subsequent internet service providers in its financing and its aims. It was not focused on profit, and at times was dependent on sponsors. 1989 saw the founding of the firm NETLINK AG. However, it proved impossible to procure the necessary venture capital, because none of the potential investors believed in the vision of a comprehensive global internet. In 1991, 180 people were making use of Cultnet as a platform for the exchange of ideas and information. Steff Gruber’s firm Pixxel.com meanwhile created ‘internet identities’ by designing domains with memorable names, while at the same time offering related services. For example, in 1995 the first Swiss search engine was launched in the form of web.ch. Gruber has created and sold internet names like MICROMANIA.COM and LOVEIT.COM. And his sale of another domain in the year 2000 made a considerable media impact. When the software giant Microsoft gave the name Xbox to its new gaming console, it was unaware that the internet name XBOX.COM had been taken by Steff Gruber years ago.Amstutz, Bruno, Kopf der Woche. Steff Gruber: Der Internetpionier machte ein Bombengeschäft mit Bill Gates, in: WerbeWoche, 23.03.2000, S. 3. Gruber has realised many projects through the sale of internet domains. Steff Gruber’s involvement with the internet extends to artistic projects, like the multimedia installation webdesire.com/project02, shown for the first time in 2001 at the Yellow House in Flims in connection with the exhibition Die Schaukel. Eine Ausstellung zu Erotik [The Swing – an Exhibition in Erotics].Exinger, Peter, Unterm Rock. Ausstellung „Die Schaukel“ im gelben Haus zu Flims, in: SonntagsBlick, 24.06.2001. High frequency technology Steff Gruber was a radio ham in his youth, and still pursues this youthful hobby with great enthusiasm. Under the calling signal HB9FXLwww.qrz.com/db/HB9FXL he operates a short-wave radio station, which he also uses as a laboratory for trials and experiments. Together with likeminded radio aficionados, he founded the WaveFactory association. This interdisciplinary group is dedicated to the goal of researching into the ionosphere and developing new forms of antennae, serving as an interface between high-tech, art and science. Gruber’s expeditions – like that in 2016 to Cambodia, where he also operates a shortwave test transmitterwww.qrz.com/db/XU7AKB – illustrate his continuing restless search for new experiences and discoveries. Since 2016 he has also been publishing in the radio amateur journal HBradio, where he regularly contributes articles in the ‘Newcomer’ series. Companies As long ago as 1973 Steff Gruber founded his first company, Steff Gruber Enterprises. As a graphic artist, film maker and technician, he functioned in multiple roles in creating his first authored films, television advertising spots and industrial films, and designing posters and advertisements. In 1976 Gruber joined René Grossenbacher to found ALIVE Productions GmbH, today a cultural publicity firm under the name of ALIVE Media AG.www.alive.ch The company, which he continues to direct at the present day, is the leading distribution firm for cultural publicity in Zurich.Buchbinder, Sascha, Steff Gruber – fünf Millionen Kulturplakate für Zürich, in: Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 10./11.08.1996. Since 2004 the company has also been a partner and shareholder of Lucerne-based Modul AG,www.modul.ch the market leader in this field in Central Switzerland. In 1995 Gruber set up the Erotic Book Store (EBS) in Zurich. This was the first bookshop in Europe to stock everything erotic in print, ranging from sex education books to theoretical manuals, from belles lettres to picture books. It has been going for ten years, meeting with an enthusiastic response from the media.Räber, Lilian, „Und Lady Di ist auch dabei“: Der Erotic Book Store, in: Die Wochenzeitung (WOZ), No. 41, 10.10.1997.Portrait Erotic Book Store (SRF) on YouTube In 1998 Gruber, together with the auctioneer Peter Simon, opened the Zurich gallery PAGE, Prints and Graphic Editions, a forum for original graphics.Ein Forum für Originalgraphik. Die neue Zürcher Galerie Page, in: Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 3.12.1998. Today Steff Gruber is managing director of ALIVE Media AG, of the film production company KINO.NET AGwww.kino.net and of the internet company media.ch AG, as well as a member of the board of directors of the cultural publicity firm Modul AG and President of WaveFactory.

Together with Milko Kos, Bogo Grafenauer, and Vasilij Melik, he is considered the co-founder of the Ljubljana school of historiography.  Life and work  He was born in the village of Bela Cerkev near Novo Mesto in what was then the Duchy of Carniola, Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the son of Davorin Zwitter, a Carinthian Slovene judge. The family decided to stay in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after the Carinthian Plebiscite assigned their native region to the Republic of Austria. After finishing grammar school in Novo Mesto, he enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied history and geography. Between 1926 and 1928, he studied also at the University of Vienna. Between 1930 and 1932, he studied in Paris under the supervision of Albert Mathiez. Between 1932 and 1938, he taught at the Ljubljana Classical Lyceum. In 1938, he became professor at the University of Ljubljana. In the 1930s, he was active in public life, publishing critical articles in left liberal journals, such as Sodobnost and Ljubljanski zvon. Soon after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he joined the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. In May of the same year, he was arrested by the Italian occupation authorities of the Province of Ljubljana, but released soon afterwards. In March 1942, he was arrested again and sent to the internment camp in Aprica, on the Italian-Swiss border. After the Italian armistice, he found his way back to Slovenia, where he joined the partisan resistance. Between January 1944 and March 1945, he organized and led the Scientific Institute of the Executive Council of the Liberation Front, a unique institution in the Nazi-occupied Europe. The institute mainly prepared documentation on border issues and prepared expertises for the Yugoslav territorial claims against Italy in the Julian March and against Austria in Carinthia. In 1945, he moved to the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, where he worked as an expert on north-western border issues at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After 1948, he moved back to Ljubljana, where he taught at the Department of History of the University of Ljubljana. Between 1952 and 1954, he served as rector of the University. In 1953, he became a member of the Slovenian and later also of the Yugoslav (1961) and the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1970). Between 1975 and 1978, he served as president of the publishing house Slovenska matica. Zwitter's initial expertise was the social history of medieval towns, but under the influence of his supervisor Albert Mathiez, he switched to modern history. Under the influence of the French Annales school, he introduced several methodological innovation in the study of the demographic history of the Slovene Lands. After World War II, he turned to the study of nationality issues in the Habsburg Empire. He died in Ljubljana in 1988, and was buried in the cemetery in Bela Cerkev. His son Matjaž Zwitter is a physician, his other son, Tomaž Zwitter is an astronomer, and his daughter, Anja Dular is a historian, librarian and social anthropologist.

Young women in traditional dress had been furtively placing cockades on soldiers' tombs. An Alsatian professor, Xavier Niessen,His tomb is in the cimetière de Puteaux, built to plans by Paul Boeswillwald. against Prussian orders in these departments, was keen to show his membership of the French fatherland and thought that remembering those who had died for France allowed the feeling of national unity to be maintained. Thus, on 7 March 1888 he summoned the French to join his new association, which then had a highly active period. It is one of France's oldest associations d’utilité publique (being recognised as such on 1 February 1906) and has three aims: * to conserve the memory of those who have died for France * to maintain memorials to France's war dead * to hand down the memory of them to future generations Many of its supporters were mobilised in the First World War, with the remaining ones looking after war graves and accompanying the families of the war dead on visits to them. The association was then in charge of 88,000 burials from the Franco-Prussian War and could only handle 1,700,000 burials of dead from the First World War. Thus the law of 31 July 1920 created the \\"service national des sépultures\\", took charge of military cemeteries and organised nationals necropolises. After the Second World War general Lacapelle, president of Le Souvenir Français, demanded the identification of 100,000 French soldiers who had died the battle of France and the maintenance of their tombs. It has a general delegation by department, around 1,450 local committees in France and 52 foreign delegations. It now has 130,000 active members.

They were first discovered in Drosophila, through a mutant screen for genes involved in axon guidance. The Drosophila roundabout mutant was named after its phenotype, which resembled the circular traffic junctions (see roundabout). The Robo receptors are most well known for their role in the development of the nervous system, where they have been shown to respond to secreted Slit ligands. One well-studied example is the requirement for Slit-Robo signaling in regulation of axonal midline crossing. Slit-Robo signaling is also critical for many neurodevelopmental processes including formation of the olfactory tract, the optic nerve, and motor axon fasciculation. In addition, Slit-Robo signaling contributes to cell migration and the development of other tissues such as the lung, kidney, liver, muscle and breast. Mutations in Robo genes have been linked to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders in humans.  Discovery  A large-scale screen of the Drosophila genome for mutants that exhibited axon guidance defects led to the discovery of the roundabout (robo) mutation. In robo mutants, axons were observed to inappropriately cross and recross the midline. It was subsequently found that the secreted protein Slit was the ligand for the Roundabout receptor. Vertebrate Slit proteins were identified shortly after, and were shown to bind both vertebrate and Drosophila Robo receptors and to mediate axonal repulsion of spinal cord explants. It was several more years before a functional analysis of the vertebrate Slit and Robo mutants was performed; this analysis demonstrated that Slit-Robo signaling regulates commissural axon guidance in vertebrates as well. While the vertebrate receptors Robo1 and Robo2 signal repulsion in response to Slit to prevent inappropriate midline crossing, a novel function for Robo3/Rig1 was discovered; unlike the other Robo receptors, it is required to promote midline crossing.  Evolution of the family members  Phylogenetic analysis reveals that all Robo receptors have evolved from a common ancestral protein, with many subsequent diversification events occurring independently in different lineages. The Robo gene was initially identified in Drosophila and has since been cloned in various species including mice and humans. Drosophila have three Robo receptors: Robo1, Robo2, and Robo3. In vertebrates, four Robo receptors have been identified: Robo1, Robo2, Robo3/Rig-1, and Robo4/Magic Roundabout.  Genes  = Location = In humans, Robo1 and Robo2 are located on chromosome 3p12.3, while Robo3 and Robo4 are found on chromosome 11p24.2. In mice, the corresponding Robo genes 1 and 2 are found on chromosome 16 and Robo genes 3 and 4 are located on chromosome 9. = Alternative splicing = In vertebrates, Robo1 undergoes complex alternative splicing, generating several isoforms including DUTT1, a variant that has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene. Vertebrate Robo3/Rig1 is also alternatively spliced; its two splice products are expressed at different times during commisural axon guidance, and have opposing activities.  Tissue distribution  In humans, Robo1 is expressed generally throughout the central nervous system. Robo2 is enriched in most regions of the adult and fetal brain, as well as in the adult ovary. Intermediate expression of Robo2 is seen in the fetal liver and adult lung, kidney, spleen, testes, and spinal cord. Robo3/Rig1 is found in the hindbrain and spinal cord. Robo4 is expressed in the heart, liver, lungs, kidney, muscle, small intestine, endothelial cells, and largely in the placenta.  Protein structure  Each member of the Robo family has a similar structure, consisting of five immunoglobulin-like domains, three fibronectin type III (FN3) repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with up to four conserved motifs (CC0-3). In all identified Robo receptors except for vertebrate Robo4, the Ig1 and Ig2 domains have been evolutionarily conserved and are crucial for binding to Slit ligands. Robo4 is unusual as it only contains two Ig and FN3 domains. However, recent research proposes that the vertebrate Slit2 protein can in fact bind to Robo4.  Function  Robo-Slit Interactions and Axonal Midline Guidance = Axonal guidance = In bilaterian animals, including insects and mammals, most axons in the CNS cross the midline during nervous system development. The Robo proteins are critical regulators of midline crossing across species. In Drosophila embryos, Robo1 and Robo2 are required to keep ipsilaterally projecting axons from inappropriately crossing the midline, and to prevent contralateral axons from remaining stuck at the midline. Robo3, while it also binds Slit, does not appear to play a major role in regulating midline crossing. Instead, it is required for the lateral pathway selection of axons after crossing. Robo2 also contributes to lateral pathway formation. In the vertebrate spinal cord, Robo1 and Robo2 are expressed on commissural axons and act as repulsive receptors for the Slit ligands expressed by floor plate cells located at the midline. In contrast, Robo3/Rig1 is required for midline crossing, and acts in part by antagonizing Slit-mediated repulsion by Robo1 and Robo2. Robo receptors have also been shown to be crucial regulators of many other axon pathfinding decisions during development, including the projection of axons in the optic tract and in the olfactory epithelium. = Guidance of non-neural cells = The Robo gene family contributes to the guidance and migration of non-neural cells, including neuronal precursor cells, muscle cells, tracheal cells, Langerhans cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. = Glioma invasion and migration inhibition = Robo1 is thought to play a role in the inhibition of glioma invasion and migration. Glioblastoma cells grow away from areas that contain high concentrations of Slit2 and its receptor Robo1, suggesting that the Robo1/Slit2 complex can serve as a chemorepellent for glioma cells, inhibiting the invasion and migration of the tumor cells. = Actin cytoskeleton regulation = The binding of Slit to Robo receptors leads to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin polymerization is regulated by several adaptor proteins that can bind to the cytoplasmic motifs of the Robo receptors. In Drosophila, several signaling proteins downstream of Robo1 have been identified, including Enabled, Son of Sevenless (SOS), Rac, and Dock. It is thought that activation of Robo1 by Slit leads to increased depolymerization of actin, resulting in growth cone collapse. It remains unclear how Drosophila Robo2 and Robo3 signal, although multiple studies suggest that they have distinct signaling capabilities that cannot be recapitulated by Robo1. = Midline attraction and Robo3 = The vertebrate Robo3/Rig1 homolog is a more distant relative of the Robo gene family, and is thought to play a distinct role in axonal guidance. Robo3/Rig1 is alternatively spliced to generate a protein that inhibits Robo1/2-mediated repulsion, effectively leading to the promotion of midline crossing. The exact mechanism by which Robo3 achieves this anti-repulsive activity is unknown.  Clinical applications and areas of research  = Angiogenesis and tumor suppression = The Robo4 receptor has been linked to angiogenesis in both mice and zebrafish. It is also present in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Exposure of Robo4 to Slit2 inhibits angiogenesis. However, exposure to a protein that inhibits Slit2 also inhibits angiogenesis. Due to these inconclusive results, the role of Robo4 in blood vessel growth is not completely understood. Robo1 has been linked to cancerous tumor growth and suppression. The Slit2/Robo1 pathway has been associated with tumor angiogenesis, leading to subsequent tumor growth. Slit2 proteins have been identified in several varieties of tumors, including melanoma, breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of the Slit2/Robo1 pathway via R5 and RoboN reduced tumor mass and volume, while also reducing microvessel density. However, Slit2 proteins have not been identified in all kinds of tumors, and other research suggests that Slit-2 expression may suppress tumors in small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. = Dyslexia = The Robo1 protein is thought to be associated with dyslexia, possibly through chromosomal translocation. The role of Robo1 in regards to dyslexia is not fully understood at this time. = Psychopathy = Recently, a genome-wide linkage study by Viding and colleagues (2010)reported that the Robo2 gene could be involved in developmental disorders such as psychopathy. = Robo3/Rig1 and HGPPS = A defect in the Robo3/Rig1 protein results in horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS), a rare genetic disorder. HGPPS is characterized by a lack of horizontal eye movement within the socket (although vertical movement remains unaffected) and the gradual curvature of the spine throughout development. The disorder is caused by a genetic mutation on chromosome 11, and is autosomal recessive. During normal brain development, Robo3/Rig1 decreases sensitivity of Robo1 to Slit proteins, allowing the axon to grow past the midline. This process allows axons to cross to the other side of the brain, which is crucial for motor function as well as sensory processing. In patients with HGPPS, the absence of Robo3/Rig1 prevents axons in the corticospinal tract and the trochlear nerve from growing past the midline. This abnormal growth of the hindbrain and spinal cord manifests itself as the symptoms associated with HGPPS.

Also on the property is a late-19th-century brick dairy. White House Farm was built in 1721 by Daniel Perkins who was a miller and stone cutter, newly arrived from New Hampshire. He arrived in Kent County in 1710 and obtained the milling rights to dam the West branch of Morgan Creek. Remnants of this dam are still visible from Rt 213. He not only built a small house there with the flour mill but also a sawmill and a fulling mill. After acquiring more property in 1720, he began building the larger brick home up on the hill for his family, over- looking his mills.

The Beverly Hilton has hosted many awards shows, charity benefits, and entertainment and motion picture industry events, and is particularly known as the venue of the annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony. Merv Griffin Way with The Beverly Hilton in the background, in Beverly Hills, California. History Conrad Hilton opened the Beverly Hilton in 1955. Architect Welton Becket designed the hotel as a showpiece with 582 rooms. Since 1961, the hotel's International Ballroom has hosted the Golden Globe Awards ceremony, presented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. In 1975, 50% of the property was sold to Prudential Insurance Company forming a partnership with the Hilton Hotels Corporation. The partnership sold the hotel to entertainer and businessman Merv Griffin for $100.2 million in December 1987. The Beverly Hilton had completed a $35 million renovation prior to Griffin's purchase. The hotel was Griffin's second choice, as he had expressed an interest in buying the 260-room Beverly Hills Hotel, which had recently been sold to Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei for $200 million by a group headed by Denver oilman Marvin Davis. Griffin owned the hotel from 1987 to 2003, during which time its reputation faded as maintenance was deferred and competition increased. In 2003, Griffin sold the Beverly Hilton for $130 million to Beny Alagem, co-founder of Packard Bell Electronics, through his company Oasis West Realty. Commemorating its 50th anniversary, an ambitious $80 million renovation by architecture firm Gensler began in conjunction with Hilton Hotels, which has managed the property since it opened. The renovation reduced the number of rooms to 570, which feature 42-inch plasma high-definition televisions and Bose Wave radios. The rooms also have ample work spaces, reflecting a change at the hotel, which long catered mostly to leisure travelers, into a property where business travelers constitute 80 percent of the clientele. The meeting spaces and the International Ballroom—where the Golden Globes ceremony is held—were also renovated. On February 11, 2012, singer Whitney Houston died in her bathtub in Suite 434. The room number was retired and the room repurposed. =Beverly Hills Waldorf Astoria and Measure H= In April 2006, owners unveiled plans for a $500-million expansion to the Beverly Hilton property. The plans require an amendment to the Beverly Hills general plan's three-story height limit in order to build two 13-story condominium towers and a 15-story condo hotel, where rooms would be rented to guests when their owners are away. One intent of the owner's plan was \\"to position the upgraded hotel as a less-expensive 4½-star alternative to nearby five-star rivals such as the Peninsula.\\" Two new three-story buildings on Wilshire Boulevard would house 96 guest rooms and shops. The Beverly Hilton will be renovated into a smaller, 402-room hotel, renamed the Beverly Hilton Oasis. A 120-room Waldorf-Astoria Beverly Hills hotel, designed by Gensler with interiors by Pierre-Yves Rochon, will be included in the project. The Waldorf-Astoria Beverly Hills will be the first new hotel for the brand on the West Coast. The Beverly Hilton and the Waldorf- Astoria would be separate premises, with both operated and managed by Hilton Hotels Corporation. The Beverly Hills City Council approved the $500 million project by a 3-2 vote. Local resident opponents led by a group called Citizens Right to Decide Committee gathered enough signatures to place the referendum (Measure H) on November 4, 2008, ballot with the argument that \\"It's Just Too Big.\\" Measure H authorized the Beverly Hills City Council to amend the city's general plan to allow a \\"luxury hotel, condominiums and open space\\" to be built on the site of the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Resolution No. 08-R-12601, “Resolution of the Council of the City of Beverly Hills amending the General Plan to enable the revitalization of the Beverly Hilton Hotel site with a new Luxury Hotel, Condominiums, and Open Space,” Los Angeles County election officials reported a week after the vote that local Measure H was losing by 68 votes, with provisional ballots yet to be counted. On December 2, 2008, Proposal H passed by 129 votes with over 15,000 cast. In April 2014, Oasis West Realty, owner of The Beverly Hilton and Hilton Worldwide announced that Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills will be built at the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire Boulevards, adjacent to the hotel. The 12-story, 170-room Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills was designed by architecture firm Gensler with interior designer by Pierre-Yves Rochon. The hotel also features a monumental stainless steel sculpture titled 'SWAY' which was designed and fabricated by sculptor Nick Petronzio. Additionally, The Waldorf Astoria will have an upscale restaurant open to the public and stores including: jeweler Graff Diamonds, a Waldorf Astoria Spa meeting space and a ballroom that will hold up to 200 people. Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills is slated to open in 2017. = Beverly Hills Measure HH = Measure HH (or the Hilton Condominium Tower initiative) was a November 2016 ballot initiative to allow Oasis West Realty to build a 37-story condominium tower on the Beverly Hilton site. The initiative was rejected by Beverly Hills voters, with nearly 56% voting no.

The Hon. Richard Franchot was appointed colonel of the regiment and authorized to establish his headquarters at Richfield Springs, Otsego County. He proceeded without delay to organize the regiment, and on August 23, 1862, the regiment was mustered into the service of the Union Army. The command at that time consisted of 39 officers and 946 enlisted men. The 121st Regiment proceeded to Washington, arriving there on the morning of September 3, and was assigned provisionally to a brigade under Colonel Gibson with headquarters at Fort Lincoln. On the march to the South Mountain and Antietam battlefields the regiment was assigned to the Second Brigade, First Division, Sixth Corps and remained with the command during its entire term of service. Colonel Richard Franchot resigned on September 25, 1862, and selected Colonel Emory Upton, at the time a first lieutenant in the Regular army, under whose command the regiment made a record second to none in the Army of the Potomac. There is an interesting controversy concerning who captured Confederate Major General Custis Lee, son of Robert E. Lee, at the Battle of Sailor's Creek Virginia on April 6, 1865.

To successfully deal with change, all executives need the skills and tools for both strategy formulation and implementation.May, R. (n.d.). Strategic Leadership for Executives. BusinessDictionary.com - Online Business Dictionary. Retrieved October 15, 2013, from http://www.businessdictionary.com/article/682/strategic-leadership-for- executives/ Managing change and ambiguity requires strategic leaders who not only provide a sense of direction, but who can also build ownership and alignment within their workgroups to implement change.Fulmer, R., Stumpf, S., & Bleak, J. (2009). The strategic development of high potential leaders. Strategy & Leadership, 37(3), 17-22.  Processes  Strategic leadership provides techniques that focus organizations when they are deciding on their purpose and best business practices that are critical for remaining competitive and relevant. Being able to learn and adapt has become vital for sustainability. Failure to be able to adapt to changing technology, climate change, and economic factors risks the organization becoming obsolete. Remaining successful requires a different way of thinking about how to marshal the resources and deliver services. Strategic leadership balances a focused analytical perspective with the human dimension of strategy making (as documented by the Park Li Group). It is important to engage the entire business in a strategy dialogue in order to lay the foundation for building winning organizations that can define, commit, adjust and adapt their strategy quickly as needed.Strategic Leadership: Concepts, skills, style, and process. Journal of Management Development, 1991, 10(1), 42–53, S. Stumpf and T. Mullen.  Strategy execution  The analytical dimension and the human dimension Leaders face the continuing challenge of how they can meet the expectations of those who placed them there. Addressing these expectations usually takes the form of strategic decisions and actions. For a strategy to succeed, the leader must be able to adjust it as conditions require. But leaders cannot learn enough, fast enough, and do enough on their own to effectively adapt the strategy and then define, shape and execute the organizational response. If leaders are to win they must rely on the prepared minds of employees throughout the organization to understand the strategic intent and then both carry out the current strategy and adapt it in real time.Leadership and beyond: The need for strategic management skills. Advances in Strategic Management, 1988, Vol. 5., S. Stumpf. The challenge is not only producing a winning strategy at a point in time but getting employees smart enough and motivated enough to execute the strategy and change it as conditions change. This requires the leader to focus as much on the process used to develop the strategy – the human dimension, as the content of the strategy – the analytical dimension.Park Li Working Paper, 10-01-96.  General approaches  Leaders recognize the need to incorporate aspects of both the analytical and human dimensions to effectively drive the organization forward but how this insight translates into action varies significantly from leader to leader. These differences are largely driven by the bias leaders have for how they divide their time between the two dimensions. This bias is reflected in how leaders answer questions such as the following: # What is their primary role as chief strategist? # What is their job as a leader during ongoing strategy making? # What type of team should their strategy making create? # When is strategy making finished? How leaders answer these questions will ultimately impact their ability to deliver a winning strategy because their responses indicate whether and how they build and lead an organization that is aligned and committed to a particular agenda. Question 1: What is their primary role as chief strategist? Should the focus be on being the architect of the strategy product or being the architect of the strategy process? Is their primary job to come up with the right strategy or is it to manage a process to achieve this outcome? Analytical: From an analytical perspective the chief strategist's job is to be the “architect of the perfect strategy product.” Leaders holding this perspective see the strategy itself as the outcome and managing the process is either ignored or delegated, frequently to individuals who lack line of sight to the senior person. Their concerns center on organizing and mastering the data, developing the arguments and looking for that burst of insight that will drive the organization's competitive advantage and provide the foundation for future success. Human: Answering the same question from the perspective of the human dimension, the chief strategist's job is to be the “architect of the perfect strategy process.” Leaders holding this perspective see the process as the primary outcome and the product, while important, can and should be built by others. There is a recognition that the product will necessarily evolve so the more important endpoint is to build the capacity for strategic thinking across the group so that change, when it occurs, can be absorbed more quickly and more completely. Question 2: What is their job as a leader during ongoing strategy making? Linked to the first question, this second question focuses on how leaders conceptualize their role as they participate in the ongoing strategy process. Is it to provide bold, clear leadership that elicits confidence in their personal capabilities as “hero”, or is it to serve as a “coach and guide” who enables others to perform and stand in the limelight?The effects of management styles on strategic planning. Journal of Business Strategy, 1987, 7(3), T. Mullen and S. Stumpf. Analytical: Analytical leaders feel the need to personally come up with the right answer. If they are to be the leader, they must be the one with the solutions. They feel obligated to lead from the front on strategic issues, demonstrating expertise through business insights and customer knowledge, skillfully outsmarting the competition and outguessing the marketplace. These leaders are seen as visionary, smart leaders comfortably assuming star status as they fill the role of a Homeric hero. Human: These leaders view themselves as coaches or guides, believing that the organization's strategy is only as good as the breadth and depth of the understanding and commitment that it attracts. Responsibility for developing the strategy is widely dispersed but carefully coordinated. These leaders focus on guiding and responding while building commitment and empowerment among those building the strategy. Question 3: What type of team should their strategy making create? This third question recognizes that every strategy process defines a community and creates a team. This is true whether the leader is aware of it or not and whether the leader manages it or not. The question being asked is, “Does the strategy making create an exclusive club of capable thinkers, or create a broad base of ownership and commitment leading to a sense of citizenship across a much larger group?” Analytical: The analytical approach to strategy creates an exclusive “inner circle” of thinkers who are in the know and make most of the decisions. Being part of this group feels good because it is similar to being part of a private society. The common element that binds society members together is their close knit exclusiveness and the extraordinary access and understanding of the data and thinking that leads to the strategy. This smaller group is well versed in the views of the leader and the data, and knows how the different pieces of the strategy fit together. Human: A leader focusing on the human dimension is concerned about building a sense of citizenship among a much larger group of people. It is built around a process that invites much broader participation and relies on input from many others outside of the top team. The aim is to create a sense of belonging and ownership across the organization. In this situation many more people feel they can have an informed opinion about the overall strategy. They believe they have been part of its development, and that they can influence the outcome. In that sense, it is their strategy. Question 4: When is strategy making finished? Most leaders have an idea of how strategy making and time are related. The question being asked is, “Is strategy making as a discrete set of sequential activities with a defined start and stop? Or, is strategy something that is continually reforming itself, never quite complete or perfected but always in a state of evolution?” At its essence, the question is, “In the organization, is the strategy process fundamentally linear with a defined beginning and end or is it fundamentally iterative with no defined endpoint?” Analytical: From the analytical view good strategy making follows a linear process with each task being “checked off” as it is completed. As set out in many strategy texts, it is a set of reasonably well defined steps leading to a fully formed plan of execution. Effectively, the strategy is set for a defined time period and executed. Human: Leaders who lean to the human dimension see strategy as a continuing work in process, something that is more free-flowing, never truly complete but continuously being shaped as interactions occur with customers and competitors and as new issues and knowledge emerge from the people throughout the organization. They are comfortable circling back on key ideas and frequently will drive the strategy process to re-visit critical assumptions and, based on the insights gained, alter course. For these individuals, changes in strategy are markers of leadership success, not leadership failure.  Incorporating both analytical and human dimensions  To integrate both dimensions into strategy making in a way that creates a winning outcome and gets the whole organization understanding and committed to this common agenda requires leaders who are clear about the strategic capacity of each of their internal stakeholder groups and who have the perspective and insights to lead in a way that incorporates both dimensions as the strategy is developed. The steps described below are intended to provide the leader with techniques to do that. Taken collectively, they define a process that incorporates both the analytical and human dimensions, while challenging individuals throughout the organization to raise the quality and quantity of their strategic thinking and their strategic leadership. Standardize vocabulary and agree on a toolset Strategy making that enlists large groups of employees needs a common vocabulary and a common set of tools in order to be effective. Deciding on a vocabulary is not difficult but it does need to be done with intent and with a sense of discipline. The number of terms that get used during strategy making seems at times almost endless and includes such words as Vision, Mission, Fact Base, KPI, Goal, Objective, Scorecard, Driver, Strategic Action Plan, Strategic Issue Analysis, Governing Principle, and Metric to name a few. Establishing a common vocabulary begins and ends by getting alignment around three questions, “What does X mean? Why and when is it used?” and “Is X necessary in developing the strategy and building understanding and ownership for it over time?” Closely linked to the need for a common vocabulary is the need for a common set of frameworks or tools to build your strategy. In many cases, toolsets come with their own embedded vocabulary. Some leaders use relatively more elaborate tools such as shareholder value add (SVA), computer modeling, and scenario planning. Other leaders tend toward simplicity. Jack Welch described his toolset as a series of 5 questions with the answers ultimately leading up to what he called “the Big Aha.”Fortune Magazine, Monday, April 4, 2005, “It’s All In the Sauce.” His 5 questions included: # What does the playing field look like now? # What has the competition been up to? # What have we been up to? # What's around the corner? # What is our winning move? There is a great deal of useful vocabulary and many fine toolsets in the strategy marketplace and no shortage of advocates for one or another of these. The important outcome is that the leader, as the executive leading the strategy process, needs to select a vocabulary and a toolset, use it consistently over time and require others in the senior and middle ranks of the organization to do the same. Finally, when deciding what vocabulary and toolset is best to use while working across large populations, simpler is usually better. The simpler the language and the fewer the tools, the more accessible the strategy becomes to larger groups of people and the more people can understand it, know how they should think and talk about it, and identify how they can contribute. Some situations require more sophisticated (i.e. more complicated) tools because there is a need for much more thorough analytics. Many do not. The right balance point between comprehensiveness and simplicity will provide enough analytical complexity to adequately describe the marketplace, the customers, what you do and how you will compete, but nothing more than that. Simplicity, where it can be found, makes a significant difference when working across a large population. Broaden and strengthen senior managers as a strategic leadership team Broadening and strengthening the team at the senior levels of the organization begins with an honest assessment of whether there actually is a working strategy currently in place and if there is, the state of understanding and ownership for it in the organization. The lack of clarity and ownership deeper in the organization leads to 1) misallocated resources because people are working at cross purposes, 2) excessive leadership time spent correcting and clarifying the direction because others are not convinced or they fail to understand it, and 3) poor execution of the strategy due to diffuse and differing priorities. Perhaps most importantly it directly impacts organizational agility because there is no broad understanding and agreement on the current strategy, so subsequent changes to the strategy make no more sense than the original agenda. Leaders can address these dynamics by broadening out the understanding and ownership of the strategy to a much larger group without sacrificing the sense of commitment at the top of the organization. Having this larger group of managers accountable for successfully defining and executing a strategy is not only critical to building winning strategies but if done in a way that includes both the analytical and the human dimensions, it is incredibly energizing for the organization. This is especially true in those cultures and organizations where the decision making is traditionally held more closely by a relatively small group of senior people. The mechanics of how to broaden the senior team will vary depending on cultural and organizational considerations. The key is to create a common context for both the “what” and the “why” of the strategy that serves as a critical touchstone for the broader leadership team. In most cases, the process creates a group of 50–100 or more people who recognize that they are collectively accountable for the success of the entire strategy and not just their piece of it. These steps lay the foundation for partnering with the middle of the organization by setting the stage for the senior team to speak with one voice to the middle managers. Build a strategy support team to serve as champions for the strategy process With varying degrees of success, many leaders get their strategy making to this point and either stop or their process stalls. A major reason is the lack of understanding and commitment to the steps required to build more effective strategic leadership practices and a strategy dialogue in the operating groups below the senior managers. These groups and especially their leadership teams frequently do not know how to proceed and there is no consistent in-house resource to assist them. The net effect is the sense of excitement and momentum that was generated at the top of the house in the earlier stages of the strategy process is lost and the strategy team of employees is derailed before it is even gets started. One of the best ways to address this is to identify and train a cadre of high potential line managers in the middle of the organization that can serve as champions of the strategy process to those both above and below them.Using behavioral simulations in teaching strategic management processes. Organizational Behavior Teaching Review, 1990, 14(2), S. Stupmf and R. Dunbar. In this sense they serve both as a catalyst for the process and as a bridge between formulation and implementation. They do not replace the leadership role of the senior teams in each of these operating group but they do serve as a critical additional resource that is dedicated to creating momentum and fostering consistency. This can be especially important if the strategy defined requires changes in the organizational culture as well as the business model. This resource also helps to ensure that the day-to-day running the business is not neglected as the demands of building a large scale strategy dialogue come into play. The make-up of this strategy support team (SST) generally includes 1 or more people from each of the operating groups, usually 2–3 downs from the senior person. The skills and behaviors required of these individuals are a blend of both the analytical and the human dimensions. Too much emphasis on one dimension over the other undermines the effectiveness of the role. In partnership with the senior team from their operating group, the members of the SST serve as a coach and guide for the strategy process as it unfolds. In this capacity, they reinforce expectations and teach methods for building and sustaining a strategy dialogue in their respective groups, ensure that the local strategy product being produced is of a uniform quality (including vocabulary and tools), and foster behavioral and organizational alignment over time. Additional roles for these individuals might also include facilitator, tracker and chaser, success and failure transfer agent across the businesses and writer when required. In addition to serving as a resource to those around them, it is unique opportunity of the SST members to participate in the strategy discussion 2–3 levels above their normal level of discourse. It is also an excellent training ground for those involved and it gives the senior executive direct access to the middle of the organization while observing the performance of these high potential line managers.Trainings that demystify strategic decision making processes. Journal of Management Development, 1989, 8, R. Dunbar and S. Stumpf. Raise the bar for more effective strategic leadership in the middle of the organization For many middle managers, participating effectively in the strategy development process is as much a question of training as it is doing. Building understanding and skills on topics such as the vocabulary and toolset, marketplace dynamics and the associated ambiguity, strategy story telling and their own individual strategic leadership strengths and weaknesses are all aspects of a process that can ignite a sense of understanding and commitment across the middle of the organization in a way that leverages the human fabric. A key insight that drives this outcome is the recognition that most middle managers regardless of cultural background want to commit to something and belong to something that is more than who they are as individuals. It is the leader's job to give managers the opportunities in which they can make such commitments. In all instances, providing the settings for these individuals includes asking them to be story tellers of the organizational strategy to those around them. Doing this requires these middle managers to understand and embrace both the analytical and human dimensions of the strategy making. It also creates a much smarter and more prepared middle manager that has publicly committed to the strategy and is in a much stronger position to make local decisions as the strategy evolves. Localize the strategy story at the lower levels of the organization and engage these levels with the question, “What does this mean for me and my team?” While front line supervisors and their teams in most instances are the largest portion of the population, the strategy making work to be done with this group is relatively simple. Their needs center largely on context, community and clarity. Engaging this group in a discussion of the basic business model and the organizational strategy provides critical context and gives meaning to their work. Their participation in shaping the local strategy builds understanding and ownership and a sense of partnership with the larger organization. Strategy making with this group begins with the organization's strategy story. Using middle managers in this role allows these individuals to raise their own strategic leadership bar. And it is through these middle managers that the organizational story becomes more accessible in those settings and situations that they know much more intimately than senior managers. Ultimately, the strategy only comes alive and communities are built when it is used to set the broad context and is followed by a much more detailed local discussion addressing the question, “What does this mean for me and my team?”Taking Charge: Strategic Leadership in the Middle Game, Prentice- Hall, Inc., 1992, T. Mullen and S. Stumpf. The combination of the analytical and human dimensions applied to this group provides a platform of understanding among the rank and file for what the strategy is, what it means to them and why it needs to continue to evolve over time. This in turn increases the willingness of this critically important but difficult to reach population to recognize the inevitable changes in strategy as markers of leadership success rather than leadership failure and in the process it builds and strengthens organizational agility. Moving the “we/they” line In every organization, there is a line that can be drawn. Above the line, generally at the more senior levels of the organization, people use the word “we” to imply collective responsibility for success and failure. People in this group say things like, “We did this well.” “We should have done this better.” “We need to discuss this more.” “We should have planned this out more carefully.” Below the line, generally at lower levels of the organization, people use the word “they” to imply that things are being done to them by others and frequently these things are not good. People in this group say things like, “They messed up.” “They should have done that better.” “They should have planned this more carefully.” Effective strategy processes move the “we/they” line down in the organization so that more people use the word “we” and take ownership for making things happen and making things better.Managing change: Strategic response, organizational realities, and overcoming resistance. In Challenges for Management, Vol, 2: Total Quality Management as a Success Strategy, Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag, 1995, C. Young, S. Stumpf and M. Arnone. Good strategic leadership practices, with the right balance of the analytic dimension and the human dimension and the discipline and commitment to see the process through during strategy formulation and implementation can be a strong driver to take the “we/they” line much deeper into the organization. A deep “we” line produces winning strategies because those in the “we” are much more willing and able to meet the demands of perpetual change. Building prepared minds on a large scale begins and ends with the senior person focusing on being the architect of the strategy process as much as the product. The focus is on working the middle ground between the analytical and the human dimensions, not giving up on the clarity that comes from the analytical rigor nor the broad-based commitment and organizational agility that comes from addressing the human dimension. Ultimately a deep “we” line is a signal that employees are developing, evolving, modulating, fine-tuning and executing a strategy concurrently. Definition of Leadership According to Ann Marie E. McSwain, Assistant Professor at Lincoln University, “leadership is about capacity: the capacity of leaders to listen and observe, to use their expertise as a starting point to encourage dialogue between all levels of decision-making, to establish processes and transparency in decision-making, to articulate their own value and visions clearly but not impose them. Leadership is about setting and not just reacting to agendas, identifying problems, and initiating change that makes for substantial improvement rather than managing change” (Pearce, 2008). Rowe states that strategic leadership is the ability to influence other to voluntarily make day-to-day decisions that enhance the long term viability of the organization while at the same time maintaining its short term financial stability. (Rowe, 2001). Davis (2004) defines strategic leaders as the ones having organizational ability with strategically orientation; translate strategy into action; align people and organizations; determine effective strategic intervention points; develop strategic competencies. A strategic leader displays a dissatisfaction or restlessness with the present; absorptive capacity; adaptive capacity; wisdom. Davies highlights the concept of “adaptive capacity,” a strategy that enables leaders to change and learn through asserting that ‘mastering chaos, complexity and change requires new ways of ‘seeing and thinking’ (Sanders, 1998). A strategic leader is strategically future oriented. A strategic leader's eyes are always on the horizon, not just on the near at hand. A strategic leader influences “the organization by aligning their systems, culture, and organizational structure to ensure consistency with the strategy.” (Beatty and Quinn, 2010, p. 7). Influencing employees to voluntarily make decisions that enhance the organization is the most important part of strategic leadership. A strategic leader, in both instances, prepares for the future and considers both the long-term goal as well understanding the current contextual setting of the organization. A leadership model that introduced Batty and Quinn consists three components: who, how, and what. The three interdependent processes of this model are thinking, acting, and influencing. (Beatty and Quinn, 2010). Strategic leaders have the ability to determine effective intervention points. This means that the strategy of an effective leader is to develop new visions, create new strategic and move in a new, sometimes unexpected, direction. At these strategic opportunity points, the most important component is the timing of when to intervene and directing change verse what the intervention is put in place. Strategic leaders think strategically. Strategic thinking, as Batty and Quinn states, involves gathering, making connections, and filtering information or “form ideas and strategies that are focused, relevant, and sound.” (Beatty and Quinn, 2010, p. 5). The significance of strategic leadership “is making decisions about whether and when to act.” (Beatty and Quinn, 2010, p. 6). Leadership is about innovators and change agents; seeing the big picture, thinking strategically about how to attain goals, and working (with the help of others) to achieve the goals (Kouzes and Posner, 2009, p. 20). Strategic orientation is the ability to be innovative in connecting long-range visions and concepts to daily work. Quong & Walker (2010) based their works describing the definitive terms and segments. In their article titled Seven Principles of Strategic Leadership, Quong and Walker describe a framework of seven principles, which are: Principle 1 Strategic Leaders are Futures Oriented and have a Futures Strategy; 2. Strategic Leaders are Evidence Based and Research Led; 3. Strategic Leaders Get Things Done; 4. Strategic Leaders Open New Horizon; 5. Strategic Leaders are Fit to Lead; 6. Strategic Leaders Make Good Partner; and 7. Strategic Leaders Do the ‘Next’ Right Thing. The Role of Strategic Leadership in Organization There are various strategic leadership styles. With strategic leadership being such a broad topic Rowe differentiates between strategic, visionary and managerial leaders. (Rowe, 2001). Strategic leadership presumes a shared vision of what an organization is to be, so that the day-to-day decision making or emergent strategy process is consistent with this vision. Managerial leaders influence only the actions and decisions of those with whom they work. They are involved in situations and contexts characteristic of day-to-day activities and are concerned with and more comfortable in functional areas of responsibilities. In contrast visionary leadership is future oriented and concerned with risk taking and visionary leaders are not dependent on their organizations for their sense of who they are. Visionary leaders work from high risk positions, and seek out risky ventures, especially when the rewards are high (Rowe, 2001). Strategic Leadership in Education System Strategic leadership is defined by Barron, 1995 as practicing existing abilities and skills and influencing others to train in new formats for new leadership models. Specifically, to obtain successful educational management within the organizational, leaders should think strategically about where changes are needed and why. For instance, new leaders should be in possession of three fundamental skills: problem-solving, decision-making and creative/critical thinking. Also, educators, administrators, and other practitioners should be trained in educational management and continually activate this training in new leadership roles. As a result, the outcome of the educational environment will be influenced by the total quality leadership. Therefore, in Barron's 1995 definition of strategic leadership, he concludes that “Strategic leadership is demonstrated by individuals in all areas of the educational environment who possess skills to create and communicate vision and effect change through interactive leadership.” Strategic Leadership in Non-Profit Sector Very little research in the field of strategic leadership has considered the sector in which leadership occurs. As a result, most of the theory development in strategic leadership has assumed that it occurs in the for profit sector. There have been several theoretical articles published on the role and influence of nonprofit executives generally. In Phipps & Burbach (2010) study they determined the role of a public executive is different from the role of a business executive. The difference between public and private executive roles included different informational, interpersonal, and decisional roles. According to Phipps & Burbach (2010) a study by Taliento & Silverman in 2005 shows the difference between the role of a corporate CEO and the nonprofit CEO. Their conclusions were based on interviews with crossover leaders who had led both for profit and nonprofit organizations. The study identified five areas in which nonprofit strategic leaders adapt the practices of for profit strategic leaders: • Smaller scope of authority • A wider range of stakeholders who expect consensus • The need for innovative metrics to monitor performance • The requirement that nonprofit CEO's pay more attention to communications • The challenge of building an effective organization with limited resources and training. The study concluded that “there is reason to believe that strategic leaders contribute to nonprofit organizational performance in ways consistent with strategic leadership theory. However there is evidence in the study suggesting that the exercise of strategic leadership is different in the nonprofit context (Phipps & Burbach, 2010)”. Leadership remains one of the most relevant aspects of the organizational context. However, defining leadership is challenging. “The difficulty of arriving at a simple, cut-and-dried definition of strategic leadership is underscored in the literature on the subject.” (Beatty and Quinn, 2010, p. 3). The definition of leadership varies from situation to situation. Strategic leadership filters the applicable information, creating and environment where learning can take place. Strategic leadership is a combined responsibility of the leader, the follower and the organization. Leadership presents challenges that call forth the best in people, and bring them together around a shared sense of purpose. With intentionality, alignment, and a higher purpose; the work between the leader and the followers create a synergy. Despite what style of leadership, the various styles can support one another to achieve the goals of the organization. Strategic leadership can only be achieved when the leader is strategic in their approach to the matters of the organization.  References  Further reading *Beatty, K., & Quinn, L. (2010).

The property, immediately to the east of what was John Scadding's original lot, was deeded to John Cox by Governor Simcoe in 1796. The first stage of the structure was a small × log cabin facing due south, and was completed no later than 1807 — making it, arguably, the third oldest structure remaining in the city (and perhaps the second, should the Osterhout Log Cabin prove younger as artifacts appear to bear out). It is older than both the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse, and the various barracks in Fort York. Built originally out of square-cut logs (as is Scadding Cabin), it overlooks what is now Riverdale Park and is aligned in the traditional strict east-west orientation, making it appear somewhat twisted to the north of the Toronto street grid, which was built successively around it. This true east- west orientation allows for the maximum use of daylight hours, to minimize the use of the expensive artificial lighting options of the period. The walls containing the living room - including the external south wall and half the west wall, plus half the internal east wall separating the kitchen and living room - remain concealed original log; while the northern parts where expanded during a very early Victorian renovation (completed by architectural firm Langley, Langley and Burke). Some of the original square cut logs from the east wall, looking remarkably like Scadding cabin, are still visible from inside a recent rear kitchen addition. The kitchen addition itself has kept with the spirit of the house, built using logs from a carefully disassembled \\"younger\\" log cabin (circa ~1840): however, the size, cutting and precision of the original logs closely matches those of Scadding Cabin, built by The Queen's York Rangers, and can be differentiated by eye from those of the latter addition.

J. Dalton: Noted Orange Resident', Sydney Morning Herald, 11 July 1924 was an Irish nationalist Member of Parliament (MP) for West Donegal from 1890 to 1892. James Joseph Dalton was born in Orange, New South Wales, of an old Irish family.The Times, 31 May 1890 He was the second son of James Dalton and Margaret Collins.Ferguson, 2005. His half-sister Johanna married John Redmond, later leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, in 1883, and another sister (or half-sister), Eleanor, married John Redmond's brother Willie Redmond, also an Irish Party MP, in 1886.Bew, 1996, p.11; Ferguson, 2005. He was educated at St Stanislaus College, Bathurst, where he was captain of the football team. A few years later he travelled to Ireland, and studied Law at Trinity College, Dublin. He was called to the Irish bar in 1888, and took part in the defence of activists during the Land War of the later 1880s.e.g.The Times, 6 Sept. 1888 In 1892 he married Frances Delaney of Dublin. He was elected unopposed to represent West Donegal at a by-election in May 1890, taking his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, he supported Parnell. In this he must have been influenced to some extent by his family relationship with John and Willie Redmond, both of whom were leading Parnellites. In the general election of 1892 he contested South Meath as a Parnellite, obtaining 2,199 votes to the 2,212 of the Anti-Parnellite candidate Patrick Fullam, a losing margin of only 13 votes. He contested the result through a successful petition to the courts, alleging improper interference by the Catholic clergy.The Times, 23 November 1892 A new writ was issued, but in the ensuing by-election in February 1893, Dalton again lost narrowly, obtaining 2,638 votes while the new Anti-Parnellite candidate Jeremiah Jordan had 2,707. The course and outcome of Dalton's challenge to the clergy in 1892 were almost identical to those experienced by his Parnellite colleague Pierce Mahony at North Meath. Returning to Australia, he practised as a barrister and acted as director of the family business. He ran for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1895 as a Protectionist, contesting the seat of Orange.

Regional Organization of Production Vinatex is currently in a process of decentralizing its production away from major industrial cities to take advantage of lower wages and cheaper land in the provinces. The vast majority of Vietnam's textiles industry is still located in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and neighbouring provinces. Vinatex started supporting subsidiaries to move out of Hanoi into neighbouring provinces such as Hưng Yên in 2004. It announced a strategy to move production closer to the home provinces of its workforces in July 2011 to respond to high costs of labour and land in the main industrial centres of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. The following provinces have been mentioned as having large potential for the development of textile manufacturing: * Northeast: Phú Thọ Province, Tuyên Quang Province, Thái Nguyên Province * North Central Coast: Thanh Hóa Province, Nghệ An Province, Quảng Trị Province, Thừa Thiên–Huế Province * South Central Coast: Quảng Nam Province, Bình Định Province, Phú Yên Province * Mekong Delta: Tiền Giang Province, Đồng Tháp Province * Southeast: Tây Ninh Province Transport costs are a major challenge in this strategy, since container shipping costs even from a major port such as Da Nang Port are estimated by Vinatext to be twice as high as in Ho Chi Minh City. As part of this strategy Vinatex also acquired Đại Cát Tường, a formerly loss-making textile manufacturer in Quảng Ngãi Province. Joint-Ventures Vinatex set up a joint-venture with PetroVietnam (PetroVietnam-Vinatex Dinh Vu Joint Stock Company (PVTex)) to build Vietnam's first polyester fiber plant.

It addresses the vocation of consecrated women and their mystical engagement with Christ. Characteristics of the consecrated life The first part of the constitution deals with the historical development of the vocation of virginity and the development of monastic women's monasteries from the congregations of consecrated virgins of the early church, and in particular the contemplative life. Pius XII. describes the characteristics of the consecrated life of women and explains: \\"Because of their consecration by the diocesan Bishop, they acquire a special bond with the Church, to which they devote their service, even if they remain in the world. Alone or in community they represent a special eschatological image of the heavenly bride and the future life, when the church will finally live the love of her bridegroom Christ in abundance. For sacred virgins the service of the liturgy is essential. The Word of God and the liturgy are the sources from which the consecrated virgins are to draw, to know the will of God and to bind themselves to him in freedom and in love. In the same part, the Pope sets out the provisions governing nuns' examinations. With this constitution fixed rules for religious communities are established, furthermore, a guideline is given to the consecrated virgins living in the world.

Early life She was born in Rittersgrün in 1954. She grew up around athletics as a summer sport and skiing in winter. In Johanngeorgenstadt, one of the towns of her native Erzgebirgskreis district, she was spotted by rowing coaches who were impressed by her physical appearance; in 1970 she had already reached her final height of and they convinced her to move to near the Beetzsee to take up rowing. She did so that year without ever having sat in a rowing boat before. Rowing career Trained by Barbara Müller, she came second in the coxed quad scull at the 1972 East German national championships. A month later, she won gold with the quad scull and the eight at the fourth Spartakiad. At the 1973 East German national championships she won the title in the coxed quad scull. She also competed in the double scull at the nationals alongside her SG Dynamo Potsdam team mate Ursula Wagner and they came second. The championship title qualified the quad scull team for the 1973 European Rowing Championships where they won gold. For women, the European Championships were the top rowing event to win until 1973 as women's rowing was not introduced to world championships in 1974 or Olympic Games in 1976. For their sporting success, the gold medallists were all given an award in January 1974; Reichel was given a Master of Sport award. At the 1974 national championships, Reichel's quad scull abandoned the race (the sources do not give the background) but they were nominated for the 1974 World Rowing Championships regardless. They were successful and were one of four East German teams to take out inaugural world championship titles for female rowers. In November 1974, the world champions were awarded a Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze (third class); Unger was listed under her married name. From the 1975 season, she competed under her married name Zobelt after marrying the rower Gunter Zobelt. Sybille Tietze was replaced by Anke Grünberg but the other members of the coxed quad scull team remained. The team won the national championships and then defended their world championship title at the 1975 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, Great Britain.

The most common test involves measuring the flow of water flowing out of a municipal fire hydrant (measured in gallons per minute) while recording how much the water pressure has dropped (from no water flow to test flow). When the results are collected carefully, formulas can be applied to figure the varying pressure(s) that will be available when different amounts of water flow are used from the same source. A process to perform a water flow test is explained in the model fire codes as published by NFPA (National Fire Protection Association). If a water supply source is considered weak compared to what is required by the sprinkler system design hydraulic calculation, the water pressure can be boosted by means of a fire pump. General testing procedure A set of three water pressure measurements are recorded from two hydrants. One hydrant is known as the residual hydrant or test hydrant and is located on or near the water main where a new water connection is desired. From this test hydrant, a static pressure and a residual pressure will be measured. The other hydrant, known as the flow hydrant, is usually the nearest hydrant away from the test hydrant. The flow hydrant is fitted with a diffuser device containing a pitot tube that measures stagnation pressure in the middle of the stream while the hydrant is flowing. First, a static pressure gauge is attached to the test hydrant and the static water pressure is measured at the test hydrant. Second, the flow hydrant opened to allow water to flow in a fully open condition. Simultaneously the pitot tube pressure is recorded from the flow hydrant while the residual pressure is measured from the test hydrant. These three pressures, the static pressure, the stagnation pressure, and the residual pressure, along with a specified design pressure of 20psi taken from the American Water Works Association (AWWA) or the NFPA are input into the Hazen-Williams formula to calculate the available flow for fire protection. The residual flow formula :Q_f = 29.84{c}{d^2}\\\\sqrt{p} where: *Qf = total residual flow during the test (gallons per minute) *c = discharge coefficient (unitless). This is usually 1.0 if using a diffuser. If using a wand to measure the stagnation pressure, the coefficient value depends on the shape of the flow hydrant orifice. A smooth and rounded outlet has c=0.9, a square and sharp outlet has c=0.8, and a square outlet which projects into the barrel has c=0.7. *d = diameter of the outlet (inches) *p = stagnation pressure or pitot pressure (velocity head) (pounds per square inch) The Hazen-Williams formula for flow testing :Q_r = Q_f \\\\cdot \\\\frac{{ ( P_s - P_d} ) ^{0.54}}{{ (P_s - P_r}) ^{0.54}} where: *Qr = flow predicted at specified or design residual pressure (gallons per minute) *Qf = total residual flow during the test (gallons per minute) *Ps = stagnation pressure measured during test (pounds per square inch) *Pd = design or specified residual pressure (usually 20 pounds per square inch) *Pr = residual pressure measured during test (pounds per square inch) References Fire suppression ","title":"Water flow test"},{"id":"21224874","text":"Stanislav Stratiev (Bulgarian: Станислав Стратиев) (September 9, 1941–September 20, 2000) was a Bulgarian playwright, screenwriter, and author.

Stratiev's career as a playwright took off in 1974 with the runaway success of his first play, The Roman Bath, which was performed at the Sofia's Satirical Theatre for more than 10 consecutive seasons to packed halls. That was followed by The Suede Jacket, The Bus, and many others. Stratiev's plays have been performed in Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Morocco, Poland, Romania, Russia, Sweden, Syria, the Slovak Republic, Turkey, and others. His play It's a Short Life (translated in French as La vie bien qu'elle soit courte) won the First Prize at the Maubeuge International Theatre Festival in 1990. On the Other Side was runner-up in the BBC World Service Radio's Playwriting Competition 1993 and was produced and broadcast by the BBC. While most popular as a playwright, Stratiev also wrote prose works combining social satire and lyricism, translated into more than 30 languages all over the world. His film scripts earned him international acclaim too: Equilibrium won a silver medal at the 13th International Film Festival in Moscow in 1983; Childhood Sun won \\"The Child in Our Time\\" award at the MIFED in Milan that same year.

Arets was previously the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the Berlin University of the Arts (UdK), Germany, and studied at the Technical University of Eindhoven, graduating in 1983. The same year later he founded Wiel Arets Architects, a multidisciplinary architecture and design studio, today with studios in Amsterdam, Maastricht, Munich, and Zürich. From 1995-2002 he was the Dean of the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam, where he introduced the idea of 'progressive-research' and co-founded the school's architectural journal named HUNCH. Life and career Wiel Arets was born on 6 May 1955 in Heerlen, Netherlands to Wiel Arets (1929) and Mia Heuts (1931). His father was a book printer and his mother was a fashion designer, both from whom he learned respect for the tradition of craft and a love of books and reading. He briefly studied engineering, and then physics, before ultimately deciding on architecture. He divides his time between Chicago, Maastricht, Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich, living and working in each city. He is married and has two children. Arets' work is generally characterized by a minimalist, geometric and austere approach that responds to local contingencies in a flexible way, with Arets explaining: > 'We want our buildings to fit into the existing context, yet remain flexible > and open to change'.Arets, Wiel. \\"AA Files No. 21\\". Architectural > Association London, 1991, pp.16-25. During his studies at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) Arets became fascinated by the works and words of Paul Valéry, Giorgio Grassi and Cesare Cattaneo, quickly developing his admiration for 'the dialogue' as an operative method, best exemplified by Valéry's 'Eupalinos' and Cattaneo's 'Giovanni e Giuseppe'. While studying Arets co-founded the architectural journal Wiederhall and organized a series of visiting lecturers at the TU/e that included the architects Zaha Hadid, Tadao Ando and Peter Eisenmann, among others. Subsequently, Arets organized the first European exhibition of Tadao Ando's work. It was during this period that Arets 'rediscovered' the work of Dutch architect Frits Peutz, who transformed the city of Heerlen from an industrial coal mining hub and into a modern city through his many built commissions funded by the coal industry, most recognizably the Glaspaleis. With the decline of industry the city lost most of its status as an industrial area in Limburg and Frits Peutz faded from architectural prominence. As a student Arets undertook extensive research in the archives of Peutz's office, eventually producing the monograph 'F.P.J Peutz Architekt 1916-1966' (1981) and an accompanying traveling exhibition. After graduating from the TU/e in 1983 Arets travelled extensively throughout Russia, the United States and Japan. While in Japan Arets visited and interviewed several prominent architects including Fumihiko Maki, Kazuo Shinohara, Itsuko Hasegawa and Tadao Ando, later publishing these interviews and articles in the Dutch architecture magazine de Architect. Arets first garnered international architectural attention with the completion of the Maastricht Academy of Art and Architecture in 1993, described by Kenneth Frampton as: > 'Revitalizing an existing institution within the old urban core in such a > way as to transform both the institution and the urban fabric...All of this > was achieved without abandoning for the moment the minimalist expression of > an architecture degree zero, derived in part from Sol LeWitt and in part > from Tadao Ando.' In 2004 Arets completed the library of Utrecht University, situated in the Uithof area of the campus designed by OMA which dictated a strict orthogonal requirement for all buildings. The library's exterior glazing is screen printed with an image of bamboo shoots created by the photographer Kim Zwarts, returning as a tactile imprinted surface pattern on the library's interior prefabricated concrete panel walls, which are painted black. This 'tactility' has since returned to more of Arets' projects in the form of imprinted- concrete or screen printed glass exteriors. Kazuyo Sejima of SANAA remarks of the library: > 'The building is fascinating in many ways, but most of all I feel some warm > humanism from it. Within its crisp black envelope Wiel Arets has carved out > an arsenal of different spaces – some low, some high, some wide, some > spacious, some compressed, some bright, some dark. This is a building that > would never appear dull. It offers a moment for everyone.' In 2011 Arets' studio won an international competition to design the IJhal at Amsterdam Centraal Station, part of the city's plan to revitalize the waterfront by reconnecting it to the river IJ., and recently finished construction on the Allianz Headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. Theoretical position In 1991 Arets published his first theoretical text, 'An Alabaster Skin', in a monograph of the same title.Arets, Wiel. An Alabaster Skin. 010 Publishers, 1991, pp. 5-8. The text merged Arets' fascinations of his studies and early career, including: cinematography, photography, the 'city', technology of the 20th century, the membrane or skin of a building, biology and the act of cutting and editing (in regards to cinematography), as well as the Postmodern architecture of the 1980s. Greg Lynn interprets the piece as so: > 'A precedent for this alabaster urbanism is Skidmore Owings and Merrill’s > Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University that utilizes an alabaster > curtain wall that breaks down the boundary between the interior and exterior > without transparency. Light is admitted from the outside during the day and > the interior emanates a glowing light at night. The polished surface of the > blank curtain wall reflects the adjacent buildings while allowing > permeability. Likewise, in Arets’ work there is the stealth of a > chameleon.'Lynn, Greg. Maastricht Academy for the Arts and Architecture. 010 > Publishers, 1994, p. 40. Teaching Arets was Dean of the Berlage Institute from 1995-2002 where he changed the school to a research based institute focusing on 'progressive- research', public lectures, publications, field trips, and intensive debates. Prior to that position he was and is a professor or guest professor at many architecture schools, mostly within Europe and the United States, and was until 2012 the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the Berlin University of the Arts (UdK), Germany. While at the UdK 'Tokyo Utopia/TOUT', was Arets' research theme, and he has previously used other research themes, such 'Double Dutch', to structure output and debate while teaching; they often return to give content and context to publications such as HUNCH.McCarter, Robert. Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 139. Of the importance of such a 'progressive-research' based theme Arets states: > 'That's why, when I became Dean, I changed the name to the Berlage Institute > Laboratory for Architecture, I wanted to invite people to come do their > research alongside students and to publish their work with the studios. The > research, the production of the students, the publication, the seminars, the > field trips, the lectures that were happening – all had to be part of one > thing. I think laboratory simply means you have a theme, and you > collectively do investigations and research. And then, at the end of the > year, you have a result, which is presented in the school's publication, > HUNCH, which was originally edited by Jennifer Sigler. This was, and still > is, not just a publication of only student work; rather, HUNCH was where we > also published the work of guest lecturers, the important research of the > trips, and everything we thought belonged to the year theme.'McCarter, > Robert.

General Manor is perhaps best known as task force commander of Operation Ivory Coast, a special forces raid on the prisoner of war camp at Son Tay, Vietnam on November 21, 1970. Biography Born in Morrisonville, New York, on February 21, 1921, Manor graduated in 1937 from Cadyville High School, in Clinton County, New York, and then received his Teacher's Certificate from New York State Normal School in 1940. Manor entered aviation cadet training in November 1942 and received his pilot wings and commission upon graduation in August 1943. During World War II, Lt. Manor flew 72 combat missions as a P-47 pilot with the 358th Fighter Squadron in Europe, and was later assigned to the 100th Fighter Wing, also in Europe. In September 1945, Captain Manor was assigned as a pilot at the Air Proving Grounds, Fla. He attended New York University during 1946–47 and received a bachelor of science degree in education. For the next six years, Manor was an instructor, first at Tactical Air School, Tyndall Air Force Base; next at the newly formed Squadron Officer School, Maxwell Air Force Base; and last at the Air-Ground Operations School, Southern Pines, North Carolina. From September 1953 to June 1955, Major Manor was a staff officer with the 6th Allied Tactical Air Force (NATO) at Izmir, Turkey. He returned in July 1955 to assume command of the 2242d Air Reserve Flying Center at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan. Manor entered the Armed Forces Staff College in July 1958. Upon graduation Lt Col Manor was assigned in August 1959 to the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing, Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, where he commanded the 481st Tactical Fighter Squadron, equipped with the F-100 Super Sabre. In July 1960, Manor transferred to Headquarters, United States Air Forces in Europe, where he was Chief, Tactical Evaluation Division, until July 1963, when he entered the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. In June 1964, Colonel Manor was assigned to Headquarters US Air Force in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, where he served successively in the Directorate of Operations as Chief, Plans and Capabilities Branch; Chief, Analysis of Southeast Asia Operations Study Group; and as Chief, Operations Review Group. In May 1968, he assumed command of the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Phu Cat Air Base in the Republic of Vietnam where he completed 275 combat missions in F-100s, primarily in South Vietnam. In June 1969, he was named Commander of the 835th Air Division at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas. Brigadier General Manor became Commander of the US Air Force Special Operations Force, precursor to the Air Force Special Operations Command, in February 1970. In February 1971, General Manor became Deputy Director for Operations/Special Assistant for Counterinsurgency and Special Activities, Joint Staff at Washington, D.C. He was transferred to the Philippines in February 1973 to become Vice Commander, 13th Air Force, Pacific Air Forces, at Clark Air Base. He was 13th Air Force Commander from October 1973 until October 1976, when assigned duty as Chief of Staff, Pacific Command. He was promoted to the grade of lieutenant general on November 1, 1976, with same date of rank. Lieutenant General served as the Chief of Staff, United States Pacific Command, from 12 October 1976 until his retirement from the Air Force on 1 July 1978. Following retirement, he represented the Joint Chiefs of Staff and CINCPAC as senior military negotiator and advisor to the US Ambassador to the Philippines for the Military Bases Agreement (MBA). He also was military advisor for an independent analysis of Operation Eagle Claw, the unsuccessful 24 April 1980, raid to rescue 52 Americans held during the Iran hostage crisis. Raid on Son Tay General Manor (4th from left) meets with President Nixon in the Oval Office to discuss the results of the raid on Son Tay From August 8, 1970, to November 21, 1970, Manor served as Commander of a joint Army-Air Force task force whose mission was to rescue United States military personnel held as prisoners of war at Son Tay, North Vietnam. The preliminary planning phase of the operation was given the codename \\"Polar Circle\\", the organizational and training phase was named \\"Operation Ivory Coast\\", and the execution of the mission codenamed \\"Operation Kingpin\\". The Joint Contingency Task Group was formed in June 1970 after American intelligence had identified Son Tay Prison, near Hanoi, as a prisoner of war detention camp. After five months of planning and rehearsals, the task force deployed to Thailand on November 18. Two nights later the task force flew into North Vietnam. The assault group, led by U.S. Army Capt. Dick Meadows, landed in the prison compound and killed about 50 NVA guards, but found the compound to be otherwise abandoned. Meanwhile, Colonel Arthur D. \\"Bull\\" Simons, deputy task force commander, had landed with the support group in an adjacent military school compound, which was teeming with Russian and Chinese soldiers. Simons and his team killed or repelled many of these soldiers, eliminating the principal threat to the assault group. The raiders executed the entire operation in 26 minutes, successfully faced an enemy force of approximately 350 men, and left with only 2 injuries. Wording of the Distinguished Service Medal citation as presented by President Richard M. Nixon to Manor on 25 November 1970 for his planning of the raid on Son Tay: > Brigadier General Leroy J.

It can cause microsporidiosis. It is notable as having one of the smallest genome among known eukaryotic organisms, containing only 2.25 million base pairs. Its genome was completely sequenced in 2010. E. intestinalis originally named Septata intestinalis, was reclassified based on morphologic, antigenic and molecular similarities with other species of the genus Encephalitozoon. Recently, Some domestic and wild animals have been found to be naturally infected with E. intestinalis and some other microsporidian species.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2013. E. intestinalis is transmitted in contaminated water. It causes Gastro- Intestinal tract infection which subsequently leads to diarrhea and circulates to the ocular, genitourinary and respiratory tracts. Research has proven that E. intestinalis infection can increase host cell nuclear mutation rate.  Disease  Microsporidia are obligate intracellular opportunistic fungi that cause significant pathology in immunocompromised (simply put: having an impaired immune system) hosts. Like other obligate intracellular pathogens, microsporidia exert significant stress on infected host cells. Microsporidia infection alters host cell cycle regulation and can lead to development of multinucleated host cells.  Genome  Compared to E. cuniculi which encodes about 2000 massive genes at 2.9 Mbp, E. intestinalis had a reduced gene complement and genome size (2.3 Mbp) because of a high degree of host dependency. E. intestinalis lack large gene blocks of sequence in its subtelomeric regions unlike E. cuniculi. However, E. intestinalis and E. cuniculi share a conserved gene content, order and density over most of their genomes which have similar GC content. They also contain the same complement of transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs.Macmillan Publishers Limited. 2010.  Detection  The assay is adaptable to the clinical laboratory and represents the first real‐time PCR assay designed to detect Encephalitozoon species. Melting temperature analysis of the amplicons allows for the differentiation of three Encephalitozoon species (E. intestinalis, E. cuniculi, and E.hellem).D. M. Wolk, S. K. Schneider, N. L. Wengenack, L. M. Sloan, and J. E. Rosenblatt.  Prevention and Treatment  Frequent washing of hands and limited exposure to animals is highly recommended especially for people with immunesystem deficiency. Treatment of Microsporidia can vary depending on the species involved. Intravenous fluid administration, electrolyte repletion, dietary and nutritional regimens can be helpful to patients with diarrhea while antiretroviral therapy can help improve immune system function.Steven Doerr, MD Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD.

History Historic park in Tychowo Tychowo dates back to an early medieval Slavic settlement, which became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century. From the 12th century it was part of the Duchy of Pomerania, which split off from Poland as a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies. The oldest known mention of the village comes from 1250. In the 15th century, the timber-framed church was built. From 1701 the village was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany. During World War II the Germans established the Stalag Luft IV prisoner-of-war camp. The prisoners were mainly Americans, but also the British, Canadians, Russians, Poles, Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Czechs, French and one Norwegian. After the war the region became part of Poland again according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement. Tychowo was granted town rights in 2010.

Hoddle set the academy up in the memory of his brother, Carl, a former Tottenham Hotspur player who died aged 40. The academy coaching staff is made up of Glenn Hoddle and fellow former footballers Graham Rix, Nigel Spackman, Dave Beasant and John Gorman. Objectives The main objective of the academy is to get former Premier League and Football League Championship scholars back into professional football after being released by their various clubs. Glenn Hoddle came up with the idea of a football academy a long time before it actually opened. He had the idea for his academy while managing in the early 1990s. The academy is financed by Hero Global Football Fund but its eventual aim is to make a profit by selling players through third-party ownership, signing sponsorship deals and offering coaching for other organisations, to become self-sustainable. Sell-on clauses will eventually make the academy pay, though it is yet to turn a profit. In January 2009, the first signs that Hoddle's commitment was paying off came when former Fulham youngster Lino Goncalves was invited on a two-week trial with Championship club Ipswich Town. Chris Fagan was signed by Lincoln City, but only to be released again. James Dayton signed a 3-year contract with Kilmarnock.Glenn Hoddle saved me from football scrapheap - now Kilmarnock will reap benefits, vows new signing James Dayton Another one of the players in Ikechi Anya signed a deal till the end of the season with Northampton Town, already playing an important role in the club's survival having already scored. He went on to play internationally for Scotland, and is currently contracted to Championship club Derby County. The academy's ultimate goal remains getting players at a La Liga team or a Premier League team playing regularly for them. The first player from the academy to achieve this was Sam Clucas, a regular in the Championship with Hull City in 2015/16 during their promotion year and who has started in the first team in the Premier League during the 2016/17 season. Overview Ever since Hoddle started work on his plan for the academy, he has had offers from 60 countries asking him to set up similar academies. The Glenn Hoddle Academy have played friendly matches against many teams, including a Real Madrid XI team and Chelsea reserves.Real Battle Against Real MadridTHE YOUNG GENERATION In 2008, up to 40 selected players were invited to join the academy after being released by professional clubs or having been identified by scouts. By 2010, the academy has had more than 2,000 applications via their website and, since the academy opened, almost 600 have had trials. Jerez Industrial Many of the academy players were on the books of Spanish fourth division side Jerez Industrial CF during the 2009–10 and 2010–11 season. In summer 2010, the academy saved the club from financial extinction by signing a five-year deal to manage the football side of the operation. Eight players joined on loan for the second half of the 2009/10 season, six English players and also two Irish players. The academy stepped in to save Jerez from bankruptcy. In their final pre-season friendly against Xerez B, eight of the starting 11 were English or Irish. Jerez won the match 2-0. With the players owed wages and the club fighting for its survival before Hoddle assumed control of the football side of operations, a loan of around £160,000 was made so that the club could pay off debts and continue trading. Hoddle does not sit on the bench during games, acting as a director of football while his coaches, Graham Rix, Nigel Spackman and Dave Beasant, rotate match day duties two games at a time, working alongside Enrique Caballero. Hoddle does not hold a position at the club and will have an overseeing role. In March 2011, the academy terminated the agreement with Jerez Industrial due to the club's failure to repay the loans it owed to the academy. The Facility The players stay in luxury villas on the grounds and they are given free accommodation, meals and spending money. Each player is said to cost the academy £50,000 a year.

Like many manufacturers of the time, New Imperial found it very difficult to maintain sales through the 1930s and even Bob Foster’s win on a unit-construction model in the 1936 Isle of Man TT (the last time that Great Britain won a Lightweight TT) failed to lead to the much needed sales. thumb Following the TT win all 1937 models were designed with the same pioneering unit construction engine, although the design was modified so that there were separate compartments within the unit for engine and gearbox. The engine was a overhead valve unit construction twin with a twin-port head. A range of different ignition systems options were offered the Model 76 was available in either standard trim, with a hand-operated four-speed gearbox, or from 1937 as a de-luxe version, with a foot-operated gearchange.

Location Blue Ridge Dam is located upstream from the mouth of the Toccoa/Ocoee River, near the point where the states of Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina meet. The Toccoa River winds its way northwestward from the dam, crossing into Tennessee (where it becomes the Ocoee River) roughly downstream en route to the Ocoee dams on the lower part of the river. Blue Ridge Dam is upstream from Ocoee Dam No. 3. The Chattahoochee National Forest surrounds Blue Ridge Dam and its reservoir, and the city of Blue Ridge, Georgia is located a few miles west of the dam.

The reservoir's levels fluctuate by about in a typical year. Seasonal releases from the dam create Class I and Class II rapids on the Toccoa River for several miles downstream. History Blue Ridge Dam in the 1940s Blue Ridge Dam was built by the Toccoa Electric Power Company, a subsidiary of the Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which operated several hydroelectric plants in nearby Tennessee, including Ocoee Dam No. 1 and Ocoee Dam No. 2. Construction began in 1925, and the dam went into operation July 1, 1931. At the time of its completion, the dam had a generating capacity of 20 megawatts and was the most modern power dam in the TEPCO system, requiring a staff of just six employees. Subsequent upgrades have increased the dams generating capacity to 22 megawatts. With the passage of the TVA Act in 1933, the Tennessee Valley Authority was given oversight of the Tennessee River watershed (which included the Toccoa River). TEPCO challenged the constitutionality of the TVA Act in federal court, but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in 1939, and TEPCO was forced to sell its assets to TVA for $78 million in August of that year.Timothy Ezzell, \\"Jo Conn Guild.\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 23 January 2009. This sum included $5 million for Blue Ridge Dam. Soon after the dam began operations in 1931, its penstock partially collapsed. To prevent this from happening again, TVA has significantly lowered the water level in the reservoir when it conducts periodic dam inspections (approximately once every five years), which require dewatering of the penstock. A project was initiated in 2010 to repair the penstock, stabilize the intake tower base, and repair and stabilize the upstream and downstream faces of the dam, thus eliminating the future need for severe reservoir drawdowns.

After working with Rem Koolhaas, he started two firms, Kees Christiaanse Architects & Planners (KCAP, in Rotterdam) in 1989 and Architects and Planners (ASTOC, in Cologne) in 1990, where he was a partner till 2002. Christiaanse has \\"tackled some of the highest profile urban design schemes in the Netherlands, hosting buildings by\\" the finest Dutch and several international architects. Life and work Christiaanse worked with Rem Koolhaas' architecture firm, OMA, where he was made a partner in 1983 at the age of 30, and worked for the firm until 1989. After OMA, he founded Kees Christiaanse Architects and Planners (KCAP, in Rotterdam, 1989) and ASTOC Architects and Planners (in Cologne, 1990); he worked with ASTOC until 2002. He was also artistic director of the Dutch Building Department from 1993 to 1996. From 1996 to 2003 he was a professor of architecture and urban planning at the Technical University of Berlin, and is now the Chair of Architecture and Urbanism in the Institute for Urban Design at ETH in Zürich. Two monographs on Christiaanse's work have been published, and an exhibition of the work done by his firms, \\"The City as Loft,\\" was held at De Singel in Antwerp in 2003. He is known for his urban planning work and \\"has quietly become the power behind the throne of Dutch architecture.\\" He now lives and works in Zurich. Christiaanse was the curator of the 4th International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam, and takes on large-scale projects such as the development of neglected areas for the 2012 Summer Olympics. His latest project is the design of a masterplan for an \\"engineering campus\\" (or \\"science park\\") in the Bavarian city of Augsburg, a project for which the state government (Freistaat Bayern) and the city are contributing 60 million Euros. Urban planning philosophy Of particular interest to Christiaanse is the modern city, especially its openness or lack thereof. His designs as well as his public statements propagate the idea of \\"mixed communities,\\" as he explained in an interview, to counteract the modern move toward gated communities and to increase different kinds of interactions among citizens. Such interactions, and the social control that comes along with it, also increase security, a concern in many European lower-income neighborhoods. The buildings to be built in such new neighborhoods Christiaanse calls \\"socializing machines.\\" The metaphor Christiaanse often uses, of the city as a tree, is borrowed from architect and urban theorist Christopher Alexander, whose 1965 essay \\"A City Is Not A Tree\\" had suggested that cities grow like trees at their peril, with branches only connected to each other via the trunk. Alexander's fear, Christiaanse suggests, has become real, according to a keynote speech he delivered at the Holcim Forum 2007 for the Holcim Foundation,See \\"summary of keynote speech,\\" \\"From Trees to Networks,\\" at which is the key to his lament that \\"The city becomes a tree [the urban landscape becomes a forest of trees].\\" , p. 11. In a presentation given to the Urban Age South America Conference, December 2008, he gave some characteristics of the openness he wants cities to encourage in order to prevent this segmentation.

World Expo 1876 in Philadelphia: the motif comemorizes the 100-year anniversary of the U.S. Constitution. Coat of Arms with lions and the flags of Switzerland and the United States. St. Gallen embroidery, sometimes known as Swiss embroidery, is embroidery from the city and the region of St. Gallen, Switzerland. The region was once the largest and most important export area for embroidery. Around 1910, its embroidery production was the largest export branch of the Swiss economy with 18 percent of the overall export value. More than 50 percent of the world production came from St. Gallen. With the advent of the First World War, the demand for the luxury dropped suddenly and significantly and so a lot of people were unemployed, which resulted in the biggest economic crisis in the region. Today, the embroidery industry has somewhat recovered, but it will probably never again reach its former size. Nevertheless, the St. Galler Spitzen (as the embroidery is also called) are still very popular as a raw material for expensive haute couture creations in Paris and count among the most famous textiles in the world.  History  = Beginnings = Initial figures state that there were already up to 100,000 employees in the St. Gallen embroidery industry at the end of the 18th century, long before the invention of the hand embroidery machine. This figure is probably somewhat exaggerated, but it is an indication of the importance of embroidery in eastern Switzerland. The strengthening of the embroidery industry was accompanied by the decline of the canvas industry, especially in the city of St. Gallen itself. It had already been weakened substantially by the production of cotton started by Peter Bion, and by foreign competition. Those without livelihood in the cotton industry changed to embroidery. Later during the Continental Blockade around 1810 the cotton industry too suffered. The General-Societät der englischen Baumwollspinnerei in St. Gallen, the first Swiss stock company founded in 1801, had to close in 1817 due to lack of money. = First embroidery machines = The expansion of the embroidery industry began with the invention of the hand embroidery machine by Joshua Heilmann of Mulhouse in 1828. Just one year later, Franz Mange (1776-1846) ordered two such machines from Heilmann, under the condition that he sold no other machine in Switzerland or its immediate surroundings without Mange's consent. However, Mange allowed the Maschinen-Werkstätte und Eisengießerey, that Michael Weniger had recently opened in St. Georgen (city district of St. Gallen), the production of such machines. He himself had improved the design and several machines were exported abroad, but without lasting success for the local industry. Mange's company passed in 1839 to his son-in-law Bartholome Rittmeyer (1786-1848), but shortly afterwards to Rittmeyer's son Franz Rittmeyer (1819-1892). Together with his mechanic and thanks to the support of Anton Saurer he improved the machinery such that the quality was now nearly equal to that of hand-embroidery. Thus, from 1852 the hand embroidery machines were manufactured in series, including at the already mentioned Maschinenfabrik in St. Georgen. Production amounted to more than 1,500 machines until 1875. The machines had the disadvantage that they were only able to do hand-like embroidery. The simultaneous invention of the sewing machine could, however, fix the problem, because now even smaller pieces could be sewn in great numbers on towels. A businessman from Hamburg called these new products Hamburghs to deceive the competitors as to the real origin of the article. Rittmeyer had to relocate and expand his factory several times because the ever-increasing demand could no longer be covered. Just by itself, the 1856-completed embroidery factory in Bruggen (later relocated to Sittertal) worked temporarily 120 machines. The sewing machine also inspired the shiffli embroidery machine which built upon the hand machine, but used a lock stitch like the sewing machine. Shiffli machines became fully automated which greatly increased productivity and thus reduced the cost of embroidery. = Rapid ascent = franc note from the series of 1911, according to a draft of Eugène Burnand. The big economic weight of the St. Gallen embroidery shows the choice as a motive for the banknote with the second highest nominal price. The meteoric rise of St. Gallen embroidery can only be explained by a combination of economic, political, and technical conditions in the second half of the 19th century. In the political environment, it was the end of the American Civil War and the onset of free trade politics; economically, inter alia, the very popular mode of the second Rococo at the French court; and in the technical conditions the development of the machines. In the years after 1860, the demand for embroidered products rose so sharply that embroidery companies sprang up like mushrooms. Many farmers, artisans, and former weavers had an embroidery machine installed in their houses for credit. Thus, embroidery had soon become in large part homework and a major addition to the income of the peasants and craftsmen, mainly in winter, as it had partially been before in the linen or spinning time. For the former, it was particularly the bad reputation of the factory and the dependence on a single employer, which let them decide for this kind of economic model; for the latter it was the capability to benefit from the possibility to increase and decrease the capacities very quickly and to let the entire economic risk remain with the workers. The embroiders also appreciated the freedom to schedule their working hours and the unlimited use of child labor, especially since the introduction of the federal factory labor law in 1877, which denied young people under 14 years of age work in factories. Particularly benefiting from the development of home embroidery were the traders, who imported the commondies for the embroiders and distributed the finished products back around the world. In the period from 1872 to 1890, the number of installed embroidery machines in the cantons of St. Gallen, Appenzell and Thurgau rose from 6,384 to 19,389, but at the same time, the number of machines installed in factories decreased from 93% to 53%. The value of goods exported to the Americas alone increased between 1867 and 1880 from 3.1 to over 21 million Swiss francs. Representatives of trading companies from overseas visited St. Gallen regularly to select patterns and to place new orders. The shipping company Danzas advertised in newspapers and praised itself as a \\"special agency for the embroidery traffic in St. Gallen\\" with postal ships to North America, East India, China, Japan, Australia and several other locations around the world. In this context we must also mention the Kaufmännische Corporation, which kept improving the framework conditions for the export trade. They built a duty- free storehouse in the city and opened a school for pattern designers; they also started today's Textile Museum. = Further developments = To the next thrust, the embroidery industry rose in 1863 with the invention of the Schifflistickmaschine by Isaak Gröbli (father of the mathematician Walter Gröbli). An experimental machine was first built in Winterthur, and later went into series production at the Adolph Saurer AG in Arbon. In 1869 a new factory with 210 of these machines opened. A temporary setback affected the embroidery industry in 1885 due to its own overproduction in a time of economic crises. Orders suddenly declined significantly, resulting in wages dropping substantially. Only around 1898 did the embroidery industry recover through various internal reforms, restrictions on maximum working hours and minimum wages, and the rise of the global economy. The last crucial step in the technical development of embroidery, the invention of the so-called automatic machines, in which the design is no longer entered using the pantographs but by punched card. The first of these machines came from Plauen. In 1911, Arnold Groebli, the son of Isaac, improved the machine at Saurer (in Arbon) so that they were in almost all respects superior to the German ones. The Schiffli- and hand embroidery machines were not removed completely, despite the now much higher speed, because the preparation of punched cards was often not worth the effort for small jobs. Since the various products of the industry had very different requirements, even in 1945, some orders were fulfilled with hand embroidery machines, or it was even embroidered entirely by hand. = The big crisis and the recovery = The decline of the embroidery industry began in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. The demand for luxury products–and embroidery counted among these–collapsed suddenly, and also the free trade zones were disrupted. Partially neutral countries were still customers, but they could only compensate in the short term. To preserve wages somewhat from the free-fall, maximum working hours and minimum wages were now also fixed. In fact, these measures were rather counter-productive–only workers who demanded less than the minimum wage got a job. The year 1917, still in the middle of WWI, temporarily brought a surprising turn: the Entente forbade the export of cotton products to Germany, but not the export of embroidery. Therefore, every cloth to be sold to Germany was embroidered in some way, as embroidery could be sold. A year later, the sale of embroidery to Germany was forbidden, too, and this meant the end of the brief upturn. The last little flurry of exports came in 1919 after the end of the war, when the reconstruction of the war-stricken countries brought another short rise. With the start of the economic crisis, the heyday for the St. Gallen embroidery was finally ended. One sign of the extent of the crisis, is that from 1910 to 1930, the population of St. Gallen was reduced by emigration (as a result of unemployment) from 75,482 to 64,079. Although embroidery exports rose again after the war, the time of the biggest economic crisis for the city began no later than the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1937, the number of embroidery machines was reduced from about 13,000 to less than 2,000. In 1929 the federal government subsidized a reduction of machines–compared with 1905, the number of people employed in industry declined by 65%. The absolute low point was reached in 1935 with an embroidery export of 640 tonnes (compared to 5,899 tons in 1913). In 1937, however, exports rose again for the first time to over 20 million Swiss francs, and the majority of the 97 newly opened facilities in the area were in the textile industry.  Working conditions  Initially, embroidery was primarily or even almost exclusively women's work, this changed abruptly with the introduction of embroidery machines. The work on the machine was now exclusively men's work, the woman was, however, still required as a helper – she took care of the replacement of broken needles and the threading, if the threads had ended (the threads in a hand-embroidery machine are only about one meter long, and it has hundreds of needless). In traditional historiography, the above-mentioned advantages of home work were accentuated – in 1877 Dr. Wagner from the Schweizerische Gemeinnützige Gesellschaft wrote about factory work that „The greatest misery of our time is the dissolution of the family“. Today this is judged more critically. First, the earnings of homeworkers were at times very low, and secondly, many children and even grandparents had to work at the embroidery machines, in order to earn enough to survive. While the majority of the home-workers lived in a reasonable housing with a comfortable quality of life, the workrooms were often bad, because these were in damp, poorly heated and poorly ventilated rooms (which was, for the quality of the produced textile, an advantage). The traditional historiography always emphasized the interaction between the textile industry and agriculture. The farmers, ideally would use their free time productively, have job variation, and a supplement to their poor income. Undeniably, this was actually true for a few farms. However, the competition was fierce and the loan for the machine would have to be paid back, so that often little time was left for agriculture. Also, the rough work of a farmer was not conducive for the fine embroidery work, so that many of these agricultural enterprises could only perform coarser embroidery works. Excluded from this was the pure hand embroidery by women, as it was predominantly done in Appenzell-Innerrhoden until well into the 20th century. The earnings of the embroiderers were generally quite good, especially for the self-employed homeworkers. It was worse for the auxiliaries, who often lived from hand to mouth. The working days, notably in times of great demand, were very long. The workday lasted 10–14 hours, which caused health damage because of straining of the muscles- most embroidery machines were still operated by hand-and anemia or pulmonary tuberculosis. Moreover, the position of the embroiderers in front of the pantographs was, from an ergonomic point of view, extremely bad-the chest was severely compressed in its development and the spine was crooked. A full 25% of all embroiderers were already classified \\"unfit for service\\" at their mustering. Also, the infant mortality in the northern, industrialized districts of the canton of St. Gallen was extraordinarily high. Various doctors tried to counteract this problem with studies and public education in the areas of health, nutrition counseling, and child care-with measurable success. Through the awareness especially of the teachers for hygiene and in the hiring of specific medics for schools, the hygiene awareness of the population improved considerably. Since 1895, the soldiers in the barracks were also supposed to shower regularly . In addition to external cleanliness the attention of the doctors also came to the \\"hygiene of the stomach\\"-the diet. Dairy and meat products were advertised as healthy and tobacco and carbohydrates came into disrepute. This benefitted the agricultural sector, which also increasingly focused on the livestock industry. Even the hitherto totally normal consumption of large amounts of alcohol was discouraged.  Embroidery today  Showcase of a boutique by Christian Lacroix Although embroidery no longer has the significance for the region as at the beginning of the last century, it is still an economic factor. Embroidery machine producing companies such as Benninger AG are among the larger employers in the region. Big names such as Akris, Pierre Cardin, Chanel, Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, Emanuel Ungaro Hubert de Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Nina Ricci, Hemant and Yves Saint Laurent work with embroidered fabrics from St. Gallen. In the city itself embroidery products are, in addition to the traditional fashion show on the CSIO and the \\"OFFA Frühlings- und Trendmesse St. Gallen\\" presented during the St. Gallen Kinderfest. This festival owes a large part of its importance and its character to the embroidery on display. The great boom of embroidery and the associated wealth of the city also has influenced its development. From today's perspective, one can say that the city was built around 1920 - apart from the later extensions at the edge of the city. The Art Nouveau and Neu-Renaissance buildings constructed from 1880 to 1930 define the image of the commercial districts built around the old city. The names of these former business places suggest the past significance of world trade for the city: Pacific, Oceanic, Atlantic, Chicago, Britannia, Washington, Florida, and so forth.

Seacroft remained largely unchanged for centuries as a small Yorkshire village, until in the 1950s the area was developed into Leeds' largest council estate. In the 1960s and 1970s the building of Whinmoor and Swarcliffe enclosed Seacroft within other suburbs. Seacroft Village Areas of the original Seacroft village Seacroft Windmill St. James Church, Seacroft Seacroft has a history dating back beyond the publication of the Domesday Book (1086). However, there is evidence of inhabitation prior to that, during construction of the estate in the 1950s, a stone axe dating from the Neolithic age (3500)-(2100)BC was found on Kentmere Avenue, while two silver Roman coins were found on Seacroft Green in the 1850s. The Venerable Bede records the battle of Winwaed between King Oswy's forces and the, unsuccessful, invading Mercians under King Penda. Bede gives this as taking place near Seacroft on 15 November 655. The name (originally Saecroft) is of Saxon origin - sae meaning pool or lake and croft meaning enclosure or farm.http://www.seacroft.freeuk.com/sctop.htm In 1643 a minor battle between Royalists for Charles I and a small group of Roundheads under Thomas Fairfax, who were en route from Tadcaster to Leeds, took place at Seacroft. Fairfax was obliged to retreat across Bramham moor. =Manor of Seacroft= Seacroft Village is the original part of Seacroft, around the Green and Cricketers Arms (pictured top), it is often still talked about today. Seacroft Village is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Seacroft Hall was built in the 16th century by the Shiletto family and extensively refurbished in the 17th century and incorporated extensive landscaping and parkland. Despite being a listed building the hall was demolished in the 1950s, the original entrance lodge still stands on York Road with Parklands School on South Parkway now occupying the location of the hall. In 1603 on 26 February, the dependent Manor of Seacroft was granted by King James I to Charles Blount, Earl of Devon. In 1605 the Earl conveyed Seacroft to George Shillito Esq. of Houghton. For the next 200 years the legal dispute, whether the manor of Seacroft had ceased to be subject to the paramount manor of Roundhay, dragged on. See also The Seacroft Village Preservation Society. There is an old non-operating windmill, that pre-dates the estate, which has been incorporated into a hotel (now known as the Ramada Leeds North). Seacroft Village was surrounded by several farms, including the Beechwood Estate and Pigeon Cote Farm which was demolished in 1954 to make way for the building of the estate. The Georgian mansion Beechwood survives, the name Beechwood being chosen for one of the estate's early state schools. 1950s and 1960s =Satellite Town Within The City Boundary= Foxwood School was used for the filming of the Beiderbecke Trilogy. High rise flats along the Southern edge of Seacroft High rise flats adjacent to the ring road The Village developed slowly over the centuries, and saw very little change until the post war years. In 1934, Leeds City Council bought for municipal housing and after World War II the majority of houses and blocks of flats were built. The council had planned for Seacroft to be a \\"satellite town within the city boundary\\".http://www.any- village.com/UK/England/West-Yorkshire/Seacroft/home.aspx =Beechwood Estate= Circa 1950 - Original plan for the building on the northern part of the Beechwood Estate, later SeacroftWork began in the early 1950s on what was originally known as the Beechwood Estate. Many of the older houses on the estate are more traditional red-brick semis. In the early 1950s, 500 Wates type houses - a prefabricated system construction - were built on the sub- divided north of the Lupton family's Beechwood Estate. In 2014, members of the Lupton family still retain ownership of the land around Asket Hill. In the 1960s many prefabricated housing and high rise flats were constructed on the estate. Two main roads were built through the estate, these being North Parkway and South Parkway. North Parkway was built as a dual carriageway, in a similar way as had been done to Oak Tree Drive, Coldcotes Drive and Gipton Approach in neighbouring Gipton. In addition to this vision, other areas surrounding Seacroft were built using the same principle, in the early 1950s work started on building the Swarcliffe and Stanks areas and in the 1960s work began on building Whinmoor, none of these were however as large or ambitious as Seacroft, the intention being that these areas will use many of the amenities built along with the Seacroft Estate such as the Civic Centre and Seacroft's secondary schools. As such amenities were at a minimum in Swarcliffe and Whinmoor, with the estates only having parades of small local shops, public housing and primary schools. Seacroft also has the main central bus interchange for North East Leeds, although the nearest railway station is in Cross Gates. Whether Seacroft ever achieved being a 'satellite town within the city boundary' is debatable, the success of such a claim may be measured by the self-sufficiency of the area. While the estate offered many amenities in the original civic centre and now offers modernised facilities in the Seacroft Green shopping centre, the estate lacked amenities such as a leisure centre. The area also offered very little in the way of employment, besides that provided by the shops and the few office blocks in the civic centre, there was only a small industrial estate, most of the major tenants (Cable and Wireless, Transco and many Leeds City Council facilities) have vacated the estate. Neighbouring Whinmoor contains major plants operated by Agfa and Unilever. =The Building of the Estate= Brooklands Avenue under construction in 1951 Cedarwood Corporation HousesThe architecture of Seacroft varied throughout the construction of the estate. The earlier houses dating back to the 1950s are a mixture of concrete houses and red brick traditional terraces and semis. In the late 1960s and 1970s the prefabricated housing built towards the South West of the estate was constructed. The build quality of these houses was considerably poor and most are now uninhabited. The older council houses were generally built to a higher quality and are still in good condition. The northern parts of the estate were generally built first (with the exception of pockets of temporary prefabs), leaving undeveloped land between Seacroft and Gipton and Killingbeck to the South and West in the early years. Much of Seacroft was built twice, high demand for houses lead to many temporary prefabs being built in Seacroft shortly after the war. These were generally known as the 'war houses'. In the late 1960s and early 1970s these were replaced by the Cedarwood Corporation Houses (or 5M as they were referred to in council records). These were a quick and cheapm option of replacing the older prefabs. Like their predecessors they were also prefabricated houses, however were intended to last longer. Local people often refer to these as the 'gas houses' in comparison with the 'war houses' and in note of them having natural gas.http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=9631&DISPLAY;=FULL&COMMENT;=YES The exact same style of building was used around Coal Road in Whinmoor and Queenswood Drive in Beckett Park. During the 1960s and 1970s, a variety of styles of high rise flats were built. These were concentrated close to the civic centre, in the Bogart Hill and Ramshead areas of the estate and along the southern edge of the estate. Lower rise flats were also built around the civic centre in the 1960s. The Queensview flats were converted into sheltered accommodation in the 1990s. Since the last of the prefabs (or gas houses) were finished in the early 1970s there was no further development of residencial properties in Seacroft until after the new century. Newer houses are now starting to be built around the Eastern end of South Parkway, most will be owned by a housing association. The former Seacroft Civic Centre in 1967 The 1960s also saw the construction of the Seacroft Civic Centre, which was at the time a novel way of building an outdoor purpose built town centre. The centre was opened by the Queen Elizabeth II in 1965. The Civic Centre had a Grandways supermarket and a Woolworths as well as many other smaller shops, banks, pubs, an open market (which was converted into a car park in the 1980s) and a library. It was hoped that the centre's proximity to the A58, A64 and outer ring road would attract people to the centre from further afield, however the 1970s saw the redevelopment of other regional commercial centres. The building of the Arndale Centre in neighbouring Cross Gates threatened the centre, unlike the Seacroft Civic Centre, the Arndale Centre was fully indoors, climate controlled and adjoined a busy railway station. As the number of chain shops in the Seacroft Centre dwindled and the centre housed more down market retailers, the Cross Gates Centre attracted national retailers such as Tesco, Boots the Chemist, Wilko and Woolworths (perhaps killing off the Seacroft Woolworths). In the 1990s it had become apparent that the condition of the Civic Centre had deteriorated significantly in the 30 years since its construction. Talks were held with Leeds City Council, and Tesco were found as the preferred bidder to rebuild the Seacroft Civic Centre. 1990s and 2000s =Seacroft Green Shopping Centre= Tesco at The Seacroft Green Shopping Centre In 1999, work began clearing the site and in the 2000s (decade) the new 'Seacroft Green Shopping Centre' opened. The Tesco was cited at the time to be the largest supermarket in Europe, a claim which may not have been true. It was however still an enormous supermarket spread over two levels (the second being a large mezzanine level). The car park was also enlarged and other shop units were built along the side of the supermarket, making the centre a crescent shape. The huge supermarket as well as the other shops promised to create hundreds more jobs then would be lost through the loss of trade in the Civic Centre, this was no doubt one factor which made the redevelopment favourable with many Seacroft residents. The Seacroft Green Shopping Centre is also the main transport interchange in Seacroft, with the main bus station for Seacroft and the surrounding areas being centred there. From here buses run out through the estate as well as to the city centre, Wetherby and Harrogate. Seacroft bus station has five stands and an average daily footfall of 2,687. (See Transport) The centre was not entirely popular with the local residents with many saying they had lost their town centre to a Tesco supermarket. To an extent this is true. Although there are shops besides Tesco, there are far fewer than there were; the precinct area has been lost, the pubs in the centre have been lost and there are no offices. Until the building of the new centre, and since the closure of Grandways, it was said that Seacroft suffered from 'food poverty' as fresh produce could not be bought on the estate. This was probably not true as there was still a Co-op on South Parkway. The rebuilding of the Civic Centre did not however alter the deprivation on the estate. Throughout the 2000s (decade) the condition of many of the houses on the estate deteriorated, particularly amongst the prefabricated housing to the South West of the estate. Many houses were vacated and demolished to make way for new modern housing. The estate's high rise flats are seen as a refuge, and as such they have largely been allocated to older residents. Some (including Queensview) have become sheltered housing. Decline Council houses waiting demolition in Seacroft, 2009 While the estate enjoyed some popularity in its early years, offering residents modern houses and a more spacious community then the terraces available in other estates, the estate was one of the first in Leeds to decline in popularity. Crime rose consistently throughout each decade and the housing stock, in particular the prefabricated housing around South Parkway began to deteriorate. In the 2000s (decade) many of the prefabricated houses were boarded up and later demolished. By the Millennium, the estate had a reputation for being one of the worst in Leeds. The poor reputation Seacroft developed was shared with neighbouring Gipton. In 2007, there was a minor riot in the Hawkshead area of Seacroft. Racial motives were cited.http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/26-years-for-terror- attack.2905705.jp Despite the run down looks of the estate, the Seacroft Green Shopping Centre is still in good condition, with Tesco and other retailers making a particular effort to keep the centre tidy. The estate still suffers from high unemployment.

Their home games were played at Mills Field in Brainerd, Minnesota. History The Lunkers were not the first Northwoods League team to play in Brainerd. From 1998 to 2002, the Brainerd Mighty Gulls played in Brainerd. The Gulls folded after the 2002 season and the current franchise entered the league as an expansion team in 2005. The Blue Thunder ended operations after the 2008 season and on December 23, 2008, the Northwoods League announced that St. Cloud River Bats Owner Joel Sutherland had purchased the Brainerd Blue Thunder. Sutherland has owned the St. Cloud River Bats since the team’s inception into the Northwoods League in 1997. He also started the Alexandria Beetles franchise as owner in 2001, but sold the Beetles following the 2001 season. Both of those franchises continue their longstanding success in central Minnesota. The River Bats have won three Northwoods League championships in 14 seasons and have averaged better than 1,850 fans per game since 2000. The Bats also boast the most wins in the playoffs of any team in the Northwoods League. Alexandria, a city of roughly 10,000 people, has averaged better than 1,000 fans per game in their 11-year history. Assisting Sutherland in turning the Brainerd franchise into a thriving Northwoods League affiliate will be a staff headed by General Manager Dustin Anaas. Anaas has been involved with the Northwoods League since 2008 when he was an intern with the Madison Mallards. He joined the Lunkers for their inaugural season in 2009 as the promotional coordinator and was promoted to Assistant GM following the 2009 campaign. Following a successful second season, he was the promoted to General Manager following the 2010 season. This will be Anaas' third season with the Lunkers and his fourth overall season in the Northwoods League. On January 22, 2009, the Lunkers announced their new name, logo and blue and orange color scheme. The term “lunker”, which is commonly used to describe a game fish that is large for its kind, was submitted twice out of the more than 800 entries in Brainerd’s name-the-team contest. In 1874, a lunker was found in the Baltic sea by a one Norwegian captain Oden. It was reported that the fish was golden bronze and weighed 724 pounds. On the morning of December 19, 2011, the day the 2012 Northwoods League schedule was to be released, the league announced that the Lunkers had folded, citing low attendance. The Lunkers were last in the league in attendance each year from 2009 to 2011, averaging 555, 515, and 528 fans, respectively.

The series is produced by Georgian Entertainment. It premiered on October 28, 2008 at 8 pm EST on Canadian digital cable specialty channel, IFC. Premise Each episode tells a story of one artist or band making it work in the music business and explores in depth a central theme surrounding them. The stories go behind the scenes and depict the artists in their own environments, and in places not normally seen, in a unique and private way. The series uses an uncensored witness approach and artful cinematography, giving it a look unlike the standard magazine style music documentaries often made by entities like MTV. The artists do perform as part of the episode, but the performances tend to be very stripped down and bare, and to be a part of the story being told. The first season consisted of 8 episodes that featured Die Mannequin, Born Ruffians, Brendan Canning of Broken Social Scene, The Cliks, Dodger with Skye Sweetnam, Gracer, Bourbon Tabernacle Choir, and Metric.

Haldane.  Life and work  Efroimson was born in a Lubianka Apartment in Moscow, the son of a banker and a nurse. He studied in an elite bilingual German school and entered the Biology division of Math and Physics Faculty of Moscow State University in 1925, where he studied under Nikolai Koltsov. In 1929 he was expelled from the University for his speech against the persecution of his teacher Sergei Chetverikov, the founder of population genetics. In 1929-1931 Efroimson worked in the Trans- Caucasian Institute for Silk Worm Growing in Tbilisi. In 1929-1931 he worked in Moscow Radiation Institute. In 1932 he published six scientific works and discovered the formula of mutation rate in humans. In December 1932 he was arrested for his participation in the \\"Free Philosophic Society\\". In 1935 he was freed from labour camps in the Altai region. He started to work for the Central Asian Institute for Silk Worm Growing. In one and a half years he made important discoveries in the silkworm genetics. In 1937 he was expelled from the institute under pretext of inefficiency at work, and the pure-bred lines of silkworms he had bred were killed and copies his book Genetics of Silkworm published by the USSR Academy of Sciences were destroyed. In 1939-1941 he worked for the All-Ukrainian Silkworm Station in Merefa and obtained his Kandidat degree from Kharkov University (1941). During World War II Efroimson worked on the warfront as an epidemiologist, paramedic, and a German-speaking intelligence member from August 1942 through November 1945 and was awarded military decorations. In February 1945 he reported to the Military Council of his Army about unacceptable excesses against German civilians including the mass rape of German women. In 1946-1948 he worked as a docent for Kharkov University and obtained his Doktor nauk degree (1947). In August 1948, after the infamous VASKhNIL session there Lysenkoists destroyed scientific genetics Efroimson was stripped of his doctoral degree and expelled from his teaching position for translating into Russian, a negative review of Trofim Lysenko's work published by Theodosius Dobzhansky. Efroimson also wrote a report On the Criminal Activities by Trofim Lysenko. In 1949 Efroimson was sentenced for his Libel against the Red Army to seven years in Gulag. The formal reason for his arrest was his February 1945 report about the violence against German civilians although the real reason was probably his criticism of Lysenko. In 1956, after being freed from the camps he wrote reports to the Prosecutor General of the USSR On undermining of the agriculture in the Soviet Union and the international authority of Soviet science and On the losses caused by pseudo-innovations in agricultural biology. In 1956-1961 he worked as a librarian in the Library of Foreign Literature, Moscow (1961); since 1961 he worked for Mechnikov Institute of Vaccines and Serums. In 1962 his doctoral degree was returned to him. In 1965 he received prestigious Mendel medal.ГЕНЕТИК, СТАВШИЙ БИОСОЦИОЛОГОМ Жизнь и труды неистового ученого и правдолюба Владимира Эфроимсона by Yevgeny Ramensky Novaya gazeta 20 June 2001 In 1968 Efroimson became the head of the Genetics Department of Moscow Institute for Psychiatry. In 1976-1989 he was a consultant for the Institute of Development Biology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The main works of Efroimson were devoted to the broader area of genetics including: the effects of ionizing radiation, mechanism of carcinogenesis and radiation sickness, mechanism of immunity, neuropsychiatric genetics, genetics of human pathologies, etc. He wrote the first Russian monograph on genetics, The Introduction to Medical Genetics (1964)the book that triggered the revival of human genetics in the Soviet Union. He was the author of three monographs and over 100 scientific papers and the editor of many books on different issues of genetics. The last years he worked on the genetics of social behavior. With onset of perestroyka his results in this areas were posthumously published in three books: Genetics of Geniality, Pedagogical Genetics (1998) and Genetics of Ethics and Aesthetic (1995). He is the author of many philosophical works including his Origin of Altruism (Novy Mir, 1971). Efroimson entered the annals of Russian science as an outstanding researcher, but also as an unblinking fighter for the truth, an uncompromising opponent of anti-scientific directions in biology, an ardent advocate of genetics and the moral standard of a true scientist. Efoimson married Maria Grigorievna Tsubina (1906-1976) in 1938 and became a step-father to her daughter. He had no children of his own.

Amelanism (also known as amelanosis) is a pigmentation abnormality characterized by the lack of pigments called melanins, commonly associated with a genetic loss of tyrosinase function. Amelanism can affect fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals including humans. The appearance of an amelanistic animal depends on the remaining non-melanin pigments. The opposite of amelanism is melanism, a higher percentage of melanin. A similar condition, albinism, is a hereditary condition characterised in animals by the absence of pigment in the eyes, skin, hair, scales, feathers or cuticle. This results in an all white animal, usually with pink or red eyes. Melanins and melanin production Melanin is a compound found in plants, animals, and protists, and is derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Melanin is a photoprotectant, absorbing the DNA-damaging ultraviolet radiation of the sun. Vertebrates have melanin in their skin and hair, feathers, or scales. They also have two layers of pigmented tissue in the eye: the stroma, at the front of the iris, and the iris pigment epithelium, a thin but critical layer of pigmented cells at the back of the iris. Melanin is also present in the inner ear, and is important for the early development of the auditory system. Melanin is also found in parts of the brain and adrenal gland. The normal zebrafish embryo, above, shows the migration and maturation of melanocytes. The amelanistic embryo, below, has melanocytes but no melanin. Melanins are produced in organelles called melanosomes. The production of melanins is called melanogenesis. Melanosomes are found in specialized pigment cells called melanocytes, but may also be engulfed by other cells, which are then called melanophages. Hair acquires pigment from melanocytes in the root bulb, which deposit melanosomes into the growing hair structure. A critical step in the production of melanins is the catalysis of tyrosine by an enzyme called tyrosinase, producing dopaquinone. Dopaquinone may become eumelanin, or phaeomelanin. Eumelanin, meaning true black, is a dense compound that absorbs most wavelengths of light, and appears black or brown as a result. Phaeomelanin, meaning rufous-black, is characterized by the presence of sulfur-containing cysteine, and it appears reddish to yellowish as a result. Melanosomes containing eumelanin are eumelanosomes, while those containing phaeomelanin are phaeomelanosomes. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) binds to the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and commits melanocytes to the production of eumelanin. In the absence of this signal, melanocytes produce phaeomelanin. Another chemical, Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), can attach itself to MC1R and interfere with MSH/MC1R signalling. In many mammals, variation in the level of ASP switches melanocytes between eumelanin and phaeomelanin production, resulting in coloured patterns. Amelanistic laboratory mice, such as these, have no pigment in their skin, hair, or eyes. Their eyes are reddish. Melanocytes, and the parallel melanophores found in fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, are derived from a strip of tissue in the embryo called the neural crest. Stem cells in the neural crest give rise to the cells of the autonomic nervous system, supportive elements of the skeleton such as chondrocytes, cells of the endocrine system, and melanocytes. This strip of tissue is found along the dorsal midline of the embryo, and multipotent cells migrate down along the sides of the embryo, or through germ layers, to their ultimate destinations. Melanocyte stem cells are called melanoblasts. Conditions associated with abnormalities in the migration of melanoblasts are known collectively as piebaldism. Pigment cells of the iris pigment epithelium have a separate embryological origin.Robins, Ashley H. (1991) pg. 75 Piebaldism and amelanism are distinct conditions. In mammals The only pigments that mammals produce are melanins. For a mammal to be unable to chemically manufacture melanin renders it completely pigmentless. This condition is more commonly called albinism. Amelanistic mammals have white hair, pink skin, and eyes that have a pink, red, or violet appearance. Reddish eyes are due to the lack of pigment in the iris pigment epithelium. When the stroma is unpigmented but the iris pigment epithelium is not, mammalian eyes appear blue. Melanin in the pigment epithelium is critical for visual acuity and contrast. Loss of melanogenesis function is linked to the gene that encodes tyrosinase. Certain alleles of this gene, TYR, at the Color locus, cause oculocutaneous albinism type 1 in humans and the familiar red-eyed albino conditions in mice and other mammals. Amelanistic (\\"lutino\\") cockatiels retain their carotenoid-based red and yellow pigments. In other vertebrates Other vertebrates, such as fishes, amphibians, reptiles and birds, produce a variety of non-melanin pigments. Disruption of melanin production does not affect the production of these pigments. Non-melanin pigments in other vertebrates are produced by cells called chromatophores. Within this categorization, xanthophores are cells that contain primarily yellowish pteridines, while erythrophores contain primarily orangish carotenoids. Some species also possess iridophores or leucophores, which do not contain true pigments, but light-reflective structures that give iridescence. An extremely uncommon type of chromatophore, the cyanophore, produces a very vivid blue pigment. Amelanism in fishes, amphibians, reptiles and birds has the same genetic etiology as in mammals: loss of tyrosinase function. However, due to the presence of other pigments, other amelanistic vertebrates are seldom white and red-eyed like amelanistic mammals. Without melanocortin 1 receptor to signal eumelanin production in melanocytes, this Labrador retriever has a yellow coat. His eyes and skin are normal. Aeumelanism Melanocytes depend on the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) to signal the production of eumelanin. Loss of melanocortin 1 receptor function or high activity of the MC1R-antagonist, Agouti signalling peptide, can cause the widespread absence of eumelanin. Loss of MC1R function, a recessive trait, has been observed in many species. In humans, various mutations of the MC1R gene result in red hair, blond hair, fair skin, and susceptibility to sundamaged skin and melanoma.Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM (TM). Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. MIM Number: {155555}: {5/15/2009}:. World Wide Web URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/ Aeumelanic hair coats, associated with mutations of the MC1R gene, have also been identified in mice, cattle, dogs, and horses. These coat colors are called \\"yellow\\" in mice and dogs, \\"red\\" in cattle and chestnut in horses. The loss of eumelanin in the coat is, in these species, harmless. The distinction between aeumelanism and hyperphaeomelanism – over abundance of phaeomelanin – is semantic. bay horse, left, has both eumelanin and phaeomelanin in her coat; the agouti signaling peptide suppresses black color to the \\"points\\" v the mane, tail, ear tips, and legs. The horse at right lacks the agouti signalling protein, and has a uniformly black or aphaeomelanistic coat. In a chestnut horse, the solid red coat is created by a recessive aeumelanic mutation in MC1R and agouti, if present, is masked. In all cases, the eyes and skin are unaffected. Aphaeomelanism Aphaeomelanism is the abnormal absence of phaeomelanin from the integumentary system and/or eyes. Phaeomelanin is produced by melanocytes in the absence of melanocortin 1 receptor. This absence is mediated by agouti signalling protein, which antagonizes melanocortin 1 receptor. Loss of function of agouti signalling protein can permit unmediated eumelanin production, producing a uniformly black-to-brown coat color. This condition can be observed in dogs, cats, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM (TM). Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. MIM Number: {600201}: {9/4/2008}:. World Wide Web URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/ and horses. The appearance of mammals with recessive agouti mutations is typically dense black. As with aeumelanism, the difference between lack of phaeomelanin and abundance of eumelanin is one of words. Some agouti alleles in mice are associated with health defects, but this is not the case in dogs, cats, or horses.

Classification Despite the fact that the family consists of just two closely related languages, Baibai and Fas (40% cognate), there has been considerable confusion over its membership, apparently due to a misalignment in the publication (Loving & Bass 1964) of the data used for the initial classification. (See Baron 1983.) The initial name of the family was Fas, but Laycock (1975) changed it to Baibai when he mistakenly moved the Fas language to the Kwomtari family, an error perpetuated in much of the literature. Baibai (Baibai and Biaka) is therefore not a synonym for the Fas family (Baibai and Fas). See Kwomtari–Fas languages for details. A few regular sound correspondences are apparent (Baron 1983:21 ff): {class=\\"IPA wikitable\\" - ! correspondence Fas example Baibai example Gloss - ! *mb → ʙ, mb mɛʙəkɛ mɛmbəkɛ \\"star\\" - ! *nd → k, ɾ kəmas ɾəmas \\"bow\\" - ! k–f metathesis* kafəki ɾaɾəfi \\"tobacco\\" - ! *k → zero, *k kɛj ɾɛɡi \\"hand\\" (< *ɾɛki) } The odd change from *nd to /k/ (via *hr) has also occurred in the Bewani languages and some of the Vanimo languages. * metathesis still operates in Fas. and metathesis has been reconstructed. * is lost in some environments. Baibai may be phonemically . Baron sees no evidence that the similarities between the Fas and Kwomtari families are any greater than with neighboring unrelated families, and thus doubts the validity of the putative Kwomtari–Fas family. Characteristics of the languages Two papers were published by Wietze Baron (1979, 1983a) on the phonology of Fas. Baron argued that the phonological processes of Fas contradict claims by proponents of Natural Generative Phonology that Paul Kiparsky's Opacity Principle allowed no exceptions. See Optimality theory for later developments in phonological theory. Further papers are posted on his website. Recently an honours thesis by Fiona Blake (University of Sydney) has also been posted on the web; she refers to Fas as Momu. The Fas language apparently has a seven-vowel system. It also has a bilabial trill (Baron 1979:95), even though Laycock (1975:854) had expressed his doubts about earlier reports of this feature by Capell (1962).

At the request of Lucius Licinius Murena, Tyrannion was handed over to him, upon which he emancipated him, an act with which Plutarch finds fault,Plutarch, Lucullus, 19 as the emancipation involved a recognition of his having been a slave, which does not seem to have been the light in which Lucullus regarded him. At Rome, Tyrannion occupied himself in teaching. He was also employed in arranging the library of Apellicon, which Sulla brought to Rome.Plutarch, Sulla, 26 Cicero employed him in a similar manner, and speaks in the highest terms of the learning and ability which Tyrannion exhibited in these labours.Cicero, Ad Atticum, iv. 4, b. 1. 8, a. 2 Cicero also availed himself of his services in the instruction of his nephew Quintus.Cicero, ad Quint. Fratr., ii. 4.2; comp. ad Att., ii. 6.1, xii. 6.1, 2.2, 7.2, ad Quint. Fratr., iii. 4.5 Strabo speaks of having received instruction from Tyrannion.Strabo, xii. The geographical knowledge of Tyrannion seems to have been considerable; at any rate Cicero thought highly of it.Cicero, Ad Atticum, ii. 6 Tyrannion amassed considerable wealth, and, according to the scarcely credible statement of the Suda,Suda, Tyrannion collected himself a library of 30,000 volumes. Cicero alludes to a small work of his,Cicero, Ad Atticum, xii. 6 but we do not learn the subject of it. Tyrannion died at a very advanced age of a paralytic stroke.

A sequel titled was in production, but was not released.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. In that incarnation, the player plays as a little jelly bean with eyes, named Jerry, traveling across a grassy landscape. The game has graphics and terrain that are characterized as cartoony and cute, which attracts younger players. The player is able to defend Jerry or attack enemies by controlling certain physical characteristics of Jerry, such as flattening or stretching his body in order to hit enemies, or by finding objects, such as balls, to throw at enemies. The player can also run by pressing the Y button on the controller. Jerry has the ability to stick to walls and ceilings which is activated by holding down the Y button as he jumps towards them, adding an advantage over Jerry's enemies. The player advances through each level along a filmstrip map, and can revisit previously- completed levels by \\"rewinding\\" the filmstrip. Each level is a romp up and down hills, jumping between platforms, and squeezing through pipes. Scattered around each level are a number of plants that open up to reveal balls, power- ups, 1-ups, seeds and jumping enhancers. Similar to Donkey Kong Country, the player must collect letters that spell \\"JERRY\\" in each level. Collecting them all will give the player two extra lives.  Plot  A young boy named Jerry was a prince and ruler of a kingdom but has been transformed into a blob by a mysterious witch at the behest of his jealous brother, Tom, who has a crush on the young princess Emi.  Development  Smart Ball was co-developed by Game Freak and System Sacom. (Translation by Chris Covell. ). (Translation by Chris Covell. ).  Release  The entire storyline from the game, as well as all the towns in levels, were removed in the North American version. However, there is an English fan-made translation patch that can be applied on a Japanese ROM and played on an emulator.  Reception  Smart Ball was met with positive reception from critics. On release, Famitsu scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 25 out of 40. In contrast, however, British magazine Super Play gave the Super Famicom version a 6 out of 10 score, stating that game is a \\"run-of-the-mill platform game with only its blob- shaped hero to distinguish it from the crowd. We reckon it seems pretty average.\\" The game also won the Digital Content Association's AVA Multimedia Grand Prix Award for character design.  Legacy  = Adaptation = Smart Ball is one of the video games featured in the manga titled Rock'n Game Boy, by Shigeto Ikehara and published by Comic BomBom from October 1989 to December 1991. = Canceled sequel = Sony Music Entertainment Japan planned to release the sequel in 1994, however it was canceled. The developer was Game Freak: Satoshi Tajiri was the supervisor, Ken Sugimori the character designer, and Yoshinori Sunahara the music composer. The game was to be released about three years later and was slated for a Japan-only release, but it was cancelled at the last minute. Sony may have been responsible for the cancelation. The company were to help publish the game as well as having helped publish the original, but due to a strain between Nintendo and Sony around the time of the game's release and Sony moving on to their own system at the time, the PlayStation, the game was cancelled as a result. In the proposed sequel, the player would take control of one of six different playable characters, each with a unique special ability. The game would have also featured an updated engine allowing for larger gameplay and enemy variety. Despite the cancellation, Smart Ball was not the last Game Freak game to be published by Sony. The last Game Freak game published by Sony was Click Medic for PlayStation, which was published in 1999.

He reigned from 23 August 1359 until his death. The second son of Yusuf I, he was initially the favourite of his father due to the influence of his mother Maryam, of whom he was the first son. His half-brother Muhammad V succeeded in 1354 after their father's assassination, and Ismail lived in a palace provided by the new Sultan. He dethroned his half-brother on 23 August 1359 in a coup that was masterminded by his mother Maryam and his brother-in-law Muhammad el Bermejo. With Muhammad V exiled in North Africa, Ismail's rule came to be dominated by el Bermejo. They had a falling out, which resulted in the violent overthrow of Ismail by his brother-in-law after less than a year as sultan. Ismail was executed along with his brother Qays and his ministers.  Geopolitical background  Granada and the surrounding kingdoms in the 14th century The Emirate of Granada was the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, founded by Muhammad I in the 1230s. Through a combination of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, the emirate succeeded in maintaining its independence, despite being located between two larger neighbours: the Christian Crown of Castile to the north and the Muslim Marinid Sultanate in Morocco. Granada intermittently entered into alliance or went to war with both of these powers, or encouraged them to fight one another, in order to avoid being dominated by either. From time to time, the sultans of Granada swore fealty and paid tribute to the kings of Castile, an important source of income for Castile. From Castile's point of view, Granada was a royal vassal, while Muslim sources never described the relationship as such. Muhammad IV allied himself with the Marinid Sultanate against Castile, and Ismail's father, Yusuf I, continued this diplomatic policy early in his reign. However, after the disastrous Battle of Río Salado in 1340, he cautiously avoided confrontation and focused on the independent defense of his realm. Castile, Granada, and the Marinids agreed to a peace treaty between the three kingdoms in 1350.  Early life  The family tree of Ismail and his brother Muhammad V and brother-in- law Muhammad VI One of the palaces of the Alhambra, the Nasrid royal compound Abu al-Walid Ismail ibn Yusuf was born on 4 October 1339 (28 Rabi al-Awwal 740 AH). His father was Sultan Yusuf I and his mother was the Sultan's concubine Maryam. He was the second son of his father, born nine months after Muhammad, the first son of another concubine, Buthayna. Ismail had at least three younger full siblings: his brother Qays and sisters Shams and Zaynab. Other than Muhammad, he had a half-sister Aisha, also a child of Buthayna. Maryam seems to have had more influence over the Sultan than Buthayna, and Ismail was also his favourite son. Yusuf's hajib (chamberlain), Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, was responsible for the education of Ismail and the other princes. Ismail learned some Greek from the Ridwan, who was a former Christian. The Nasrid dynasty did not have a predetermined order of succession; initially, Yusuf designated Ismail as his heir, but, a few days before his death, he named Muhammad instead. Yusuf I was assassinated during prayer in the Great Mosque of Granada on Eid al-Fitr, 19 October 1354. To Maryam's and Ismail's disappointment, the vizier Ibn al-Khatib immediately declared Muhammad (now Muhammad V) as the next Sultan. Due to Muhammad's young age, the government and the army were controlled by Ridwan, who still held the guardianship of Muhammad, Ismail, and their siblings. Ismail, Maryam, and his full siblings lived in a palace assigned to them by Muhammad and located in the Alhambra, the Nasrid royal compound, near the Sultan's own palace. Their movements were restricted but they lived comfortably and were treated with dignity and generosity. Muhammad continued the policy of peace with all neighbours, and had good relations with both Abu Salim of the Marinids (r. 1359–1361) and Peter I of Castile. However, in 1358, he was embroiled in the War of the Two Peters between Peter I and Peter IV of Aragon. Castile demanded Granada's financial and military contributions as its vassal. Muhammad's decision to enter the war angered many at court and was one factor that facilitated Ismail's rise to the throne. Rule alt=Map of the southern Spain, with territories of Granada marked in green Ismail came to the throne on 23 August 1359 (28 Ramadan 760) in a coup masterminded and financed by his mother Maryam and supported by his father's cousin Abu Abdullah Muhammad—called el Bermejo, \\"the Red-haired\\"—who was also his brother-in-law, as he had married one of his full sisters several years before. Under cover of the night in the holy month of Ramadan, one hundred men scaled the Alhambra's walls and overwhelmed the guards. They killed the hajib Ridwan, demolished his house, and took his rich possessions. Muhammad V happened to be outside the Alhambra, and fled to the eastern city of Guadix after failing to retake the palace compound. The conspirators found Ismail in his assigned palace and declared him as the new Sultan. However, soon much actual power was held by his brother-in-law el Bermejo, who as high-ranking royalty was customarily titled al-rais (arráez). Muhammad V's authority was recognised in Guadix, and he was supported by the commander of the Volunteers of the Faith garrisoned there, Ali ibn Badr ibn Rahhu. However, the dethroned sultan failed to gain the loyalty of the eastern port of Almería or to secure help from his ally Peter I of Castile. He then left the Iberian Peninsula for North Africa after he was offered asylum by the Marinid Sultan Abu Salim. He sailed from the western port of Marbella to Ceuta, and thence to the Marinid capital of Fez on either 28 October 1359 or 4 November 1359 along with his retinue, his vizier Ibn al-Khatib—whom Ismail agreed to release—and his katib (secretary) Ibn Zamrak. Ismail replaced many of the Granadan high officials known or suspected to be loyal to his predecessor. He appointed Ibn al-Hasan al-Nubahi as the chief judge (qadi al-jama'a), replacing Ibn Juzayy, one of the most celebrated men in the city, whom Ismail suspected of supporting Muhammad V. Ismail appointed Idris ibn Uthman ibn al-Ula as the Chief of the Volunteers in Granada. His predecessor, Yahya ibn Umar ibn Rahhu, remained loyal to Muhammad V and fled to Castile, along with 200 of his cavalry. Yahya was given asylum in Cordoba until he joined the Sultan-in-exile in 1361.  Downfall  With a civil war averted, Ismail renewed his predecessor's alliance with Castile against Aragon. In response, Peter IV of Aragon sent Granadan knights in his service to Granada in an attempt to destabilise Ismail's reign. Ibn al-Khatib, one of the main historical sources on Granada in this period, wrote in his al-Lamha al-Badriyya that Ismail—whom he nicknamed al-Mutawattib (\\"the Usurper\\")—was a weak, lazy, and effeminate ruler, who braided his hair with silk to below his waist and lacked any personal quality. Historian L. P. Harvey commented that this negative portrayal might have been biased by Ibn al-Khatib's allegiance to Muhammad V. In any event, el Bermejo increasingly held the real power, to the extent that Ismail began to oppose his brother-in-law. Ismail was surrounded by Muhammad VI's men and likely barricaded himself in one of the towers of the Alhambra's alcazaba (pictured), before he surrendered and was executed. Before Ismail could act, el Bermejo mounted a second coup, which resulted in his own accession and the dethronement of Ismail, either on 24 June 1360 (8 Shaban 761) or the night of 13 July (27 Shaban). Ismail was surrounded by el Bermejo's men and barricaded himself in a tower overlooking the capital, likely one of the towers in the Alcazaba of the Alhambra. Forced to surrender, he offered to live in seclusion, but el Bermejo took him to a dungeon, where he was executed. Next, el Bermejo found Ismail's brother Qays, who was still a child, and executed him, too. Both their bodies were dumped in public covered only with rags. Ismail's ministers were also executed. According to historian Francisco Vidal Castro, el Bermejo's actions were motivated by fear that either royal could be used in a future court intrigue against him, as Ismail had been used to dethrone Muhammad V. Thus, el Bermejo took the throne as Muhammad VI. The next day, the bodies of Ismail and Qays were recovered and they were buried in the rawda (royal cemetery) of the Alhambra, next to their father Yusuf I.  Aftermath  The reign of Muhammad VI (el Bermejo) did not last long: Muhammad V returned from North Africa on August 1361, set up a rival government in Ronda, and deposed his brother-in-law in March 1362. Muhammad VI threw himself at the mercy of Peter I, an ally of Muhammad V. Peter refused to give asylum to the dethroned Sultan and instead personally executed him in Seville on 25 April 1362. Muhammad V went on to rule until his natural death on 16 January 1391. His relatively long reign is considered one of the highest points of the Nasrid dynasty, together with the reign of Yusuf I before him.

An independent study in the same year by Renew Bariatrics, a bariatric center for obesity treatment in the United States and Canada, reports 650 million adults and 135 million children and adolescents as obese worldwide. Studies suggest that if Canada invests $4.2 billion in treatment for obesity, the obesity rate could be significantly reduced to 29%. In children, obesity has substantially increased between 1978 and 2017, with obesity rates in children increasing from 23% to 30%. As of 2016, 16% of British Columbians are obese, making it the province with the lowest rate of obesity in Canada. The Northwest Territories have the highest obesity rate, at 33.7%.  Lack of aid  Although obesity is a treatable disease, there are a very few programs and resources available to Canadians that can help treat it. As of 2017, according to Obesity Canada, out of 80,544 physicians, only 40 are certified through the American Board of Obesity Medicine, with proper training to provide aid with weight management and obesity. Only 9 out of the 10 provinces in Canada perform bariatric surgery, and only 114 surgeons and 33 centers provide this service, making only 1 out of 183 Canadian adults eligible for it. Anti-obesity medication is not available for more than 80% of Canada’s population, because of the limited access to private drug benefit plans. In result of these limitations, support for cognitive behavioral therapy, and mental health support is also limited.  Childhood obesity  According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, as of 2017, 30% of children aged 5-17 are overweight or obese. In 2016, 1 in 7 children in Canada were reported to be obese. Making almost a third of youth overweight. Since 1979, the rates of childhood obesity have tripled.https://www.heartandstroke.ca/-/media/pdf-files/canada/2017-heart- month/heartandstroke-reportonhealth2017.ashx In result of this increase, children are at much higher risk of developing health problems, ranging from, asthma, type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, etc. Childhood obesity puts children at high risks of remaining obese throughout adulthood. In 2016, studies showed a declining rate in childhood obesity in Canada. The authors suggested this is in result of increased public awareness of obesity in children, or the body mass index (BMI) growth charts that were distributed to healthcare providers in 2000. They believe that these charts may have helped providers to educate children, and parents about this epidemic. Research conducted by Angela Devlin, a researcher at University of British Columbia obesity researcher noted, children who were overweight were most likely growing into obese adults. In result, causing a decrease in childhood obesity, and contributing to the increase of adult obesity rates. Regional variation thumb400pxObesity rates in Canadian provinces, 2004. A 2004 study called the Canadian Community Health Survey, found 29% of Canadians 18 and older were obese and 41% more were overweight (as determined by body mass index). In children and adolescents, 8% were obese and 18% overweight. Rates of obesity varied significantly between the provinces, from an obesity rate of 19% in British Columbia to a rate of 34% in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2004, the prevalence of obesity in the three most populated provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, matched those of about thirty US states, at a level between 20% and 25%. The study found people that live in cities (Census Metropolitan Areas) had significantly lower obesity rates in Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia. In Quebec the relationship approached significance (p=0.08), while in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan the rate of obesity did not vary significantly between CMAs and rural areas. Obesity in such populated areas often affects young adults, ages ranging from 16 to 21. Studies show that an individual who's going through extensive learning often binges on food to help relieve stress. People dealing with stress often turn to eating as a method to help ease or cope with their problems, leading to obesity. A 2005 report released by the Canadian government's Economics Division reported that \\"In 2004, approximately 6.8 million Canadian adults aged 20 to 64 were overweight, and an additional 4.5 million were obese. Roughly speaking, an adult male is considered overweight when his body weight exceeds the maximum desirable weight for his height, and obese when his body weight is 20% or more over this desirable weight. A similar guideline holds true for women, but at a threshold of 25% rather than 20%. Dramatic increases in overweight and obesity among Canadians over the past 30 years have been deemed to constitute an epidemic.\\" See also * List of countries by Body Mass Index (BMI) *Obesity Canada *First Nations and diabetes General: *Epidemiology of obesity References External links * Health in Canada Canada ","title":"Obesity in Canada"},{"id":"21226115","text":"Halle Jørn Hanssen, 2007 Halle Jørn Hanssen (born 18 February 1937) is a Norwegian television correspondent, development aid administrator and politician.

Stand-up and radio After graduating from Warwick University with a degree in English, Roche became a stand-up comedian using material from a magazine he had produced in his final year. He was spotted at one of his stand-up comedy shows and asked to write jokes and topical sketches for radio. Roche's first radio assignment was writing for The Alan Davies Show radio programme and for John Shuttleworth on BBC Radio 4. He created the series World of Pub for BBC Radio, and later adapted it for television. He also worked on the radio series The Sunday Format, Television Working with the creator of The Sunday Format, John Morton, Roche co-created its television equivalent Broken News. After making his move to television, Roche joined the writing team for Armando Iannucci's Gash, a satirical TV comedy for Channel 4. He later contributed to The Thick of It, Iannucci's political satire set in the fictional government Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship. The first series debuted on the BBC in 2005, and became a critical success. Roche wrote for all four series of the programme, as well as its spin-off film In the Loop, which was nominated for the 2010 Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). His other writing credits include The All New Harry Hill Show (ITV1), Alistair McGowan's Big Impression (BBC Two), Smith & Jones (BBC One), Dead Ringers (BBC Radio 4), Miranda (BBC Two) and Cast Offs, Fresh Meat and Back for Channel 4. In 2011 Roche wrote Holy Flying Circus, a fictionalised account of the controversy surrounding the 1979 release of Monty Python's Life of Brian broadcast on BBC Four. Roche's script centred on the imagined build-up to the appearance of Michael Palin and John Cleese on BBC chat show Friday Night, Saturday Morning to defend Life of Brian. Roche's re-imagining of the event received criticism for its inaccuracies, including from former Python John Cleese who was cited to have seen the script and commented that he was \\"disappointed by its content\\" because it was \\"not a fair reflection of the facts\\". Roche defended his reasons for writing the film as he did in an article in The Daily Telegraph, stating: \\"The film isn’t an accurate re-telling of what happened. It doesn’t pay much attention to the facts. (Sorry.) Instead, it uses the story to discuss the nature of offence. Why did so many people get so offended?\\" Tony was a writer and Co-Executive Producer on Armando Iannucci's comedy series, Veep for HBO.

It was first formulated by Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu in 1985, and then subsequently revised in 1997 and 2007 Free version in ACM Queue, September 2008. to reflect changes in the relative cost and performance of memory and persistent storage. The rule is as follows: > The 5-minute random rule: cache randomly accessed disk pages that are re- > used every 5 minutes or less. Gray also issued a counterpart one-minute rule for sequential access: > The 1-minute rule: cache sequentially accessed disk pages that are re-used > every 1 minute or less. Although the 5-minute rule was invented in the realm of databases, it has also been applied elsewhere, for example, in Network File System cache capacity planning. The original 5-minute rule was derived from the following cost- benefit computation: :BreakEvenIntervalinSeconds = (PagesPerMBofRAM / AccessesPerSecondPerDisk) × (PricePerDiskDrive / PricePerMBofRAM) Applying it to 2007 data yields approximately a 90-minutes interval for magnetic-disk-to- DRAM caching, 15 minutes for SSD-to-DRAM caching and 2 hours for disk-to-SSD caching. The disk-to-DRAM interval was thus a bit short of what Gray and Putzolu anticipated in 1987 as the \\"five-hour rule\\" was going to be in 2007 for RAM and disks. According to calculations by NetApp engineer David Dale as reported in The Register, the figures for disc-to-DRAM caching in 2008 were as follows: \\"The 50KB page break-even was five minutes, the 4KB one was one hour and the 1KB one was five hours. There needed to be a 50-fold increase in page size to cache for break-even at five minutes.\\" Regarding disk-to-SSD caching in 2010, the same source reported that \\"A 250KB page break even with SLC was five minutes, but five hours with a 4KB page size. It was five minutes with a 625KB page size with MLC flash and 13 hours with a 4KB MLC page size.\\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/19/flash_5_minute_rule/?page=2 In 2000, Gray and Shenoy applied a similar calculation for web page caching and concluded that a browser should \\"cache web pages if there is any chance they will be re-referenced within their lifetime.\\"Jim Gray, Prashant Shenoy, \\"Rules of Thumb in Data Engineering\\", MS-TR-99-100  References  Memory management algorithms Rules of thumb Cache (computing) ","title":"Five-minute rule"},{"id":"21226154","text":"The Wayward Wife () is a 1953 Italian melodrama film directed by Mario Soldati.

Clarke and Julia Arnold House is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian home in Columbus, Wisconsin, United States. The Arnold house occupies a large site on the west edge of the city of Columbus and overlooks the farmlands to the west. It was built in 1955-1956 for E. Clarke Arnold, a successful Columbus attorney, his wife, Julia, and their growing family, from a design supplied by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Arnolds, like so many of Wright's clients, came to him for a house of their own after seeing a house he had designed for friends, in this case, for Patrick and Margaret Kinney, whose stone-clad Lancaster, Wisconsin house Wright designed in 1951. This low one-story home is built of Wisconsin limestone, redwood board and batten, and glass. It is one of Wright's diamond module homes, a form he used in the Patrick and Margaret Kinney House, the Richard Smith House and a number of other homes he designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In this design, all the angles are either 60°or 120°, forming equilateral parallelogram modules having sides. It was originally built with two wings set at 120° angles which gave the house a V-shaped plan with a living room wing, a bedroom wing, and a central core that contained the fireplace mass, kitchen, and utilities. This home featured a twist on the usual Usonian color scheme with Golden ocher floors instead of the signature \\"Cherokee Red.\\" Within three years of completion, the arrival of twins necessitated the construction of a second bedroom wing. Wright approved this wing in 1959 and the plans were in preparation when he died in April of that year. Wright apprentice and Taliesin Fellow John H. \\"Jack\\" Howe drafted a second, partly revised design, which established the final Y-shaped plan of the house. References *Storrer, William Allin.

Baker is the Editor- in-Chief and Founder of the nonprofit news organization WhoWhatWhy. Baker has written for a variety of publications, including The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, Esquire, Vanity Fair, and The Village Voice. Baker is the author of the 2008 book Family of Secrets, which raises \\"uncomfortable questions\\" about members of the Bush Family and their careers and relationships outside of politics, and presents evidence of connections between President George H.W. Bush and individuals involved with the Watergate scandal and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Career After graduation from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University, Baker worked as a metro reporter with Newsday in New York City. While traveling abroad, he reported on tribal genocide in Burundi for a Dutch paper and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the fall of the Berlin Wall for CBS Radio and The Christian Science Monitor, and the fall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. In 1989, he became a New York correspondent for The Christian Science Monitor. He also wrote for the Village Voice in New York City, producing cover stories on corruption in the police union“[ and the use of humanitarian international relief as cover for covert CIA operations. His report on the efforts of the Church of Scientology to recruit Michael Jackson aired on A Current Affair. He reported for George magazine on conflict between Scientology and the German government. He wrote a story about Congressman Dan Burton of Indiana, a leading opponent of President Bill Clinton, for Salon and profiled Ira Einhorn, the Unicorn Killer, for Esquire.“A touch of Eden”, by Russ Baker, Esquire, 1 December 1999, 12:00 AM. In 2002, he received a U.S. government grant to travel to Belgrade, Serbia to train journalists in investigative reporting. In Belgrade, Baker wrote an article about the longtime fugitive Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.“Catch Me if You Can: If snaring Saddam was so important, why is Radovan Karadzic allowed to remain free?”, by Russ Baker, Washington Monthly, January/February 2004. He has written articles critical of New York Times reporter Judith Miller. In 2004, he wrote articles critical of the George W. Bush and his administration, examining Bush's military record. Baker received the 2005 Deadline Club award for his exclusive on George W. Bush's military record. According to Neal Gabler of the Columbia Journalism Review, \\"among the many stories [Baker] has covered are New York Times reporter Judith Miller’s misleading scoops about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the West’s indifference to capturing accused Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadzic, the practices of Scientology, and George W. Bush’s National Guard record, which he expanded upon in his magnum opus, Family of Secrets, a heavily-annotated deep dive into what he argues are the decades-long transgressions of the Bushes.\\" In March 2010, he appeared before the \\"Treason in America Conference,\\" a gathering of Sept. 11 truthers. Baker said the 9/11 commission had “no credibility,” and \\"sounded open to the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job.\\" In 2014, he addressed a conference of the Assassination Archives and Research Center on the \\"role of the Warren Commission on the cover-up.\\" He has appeared frequently on the Coast to Coast AM radio show, hosted by George Noory. = WhoWhatWhy = Baker is the founder and editor-in-chief of the online website WhoWhatWhy, which specializes in \\"forensic journalism\\" and according to Baker, \\"embodies a form of investigative reporting that is rigorous, relentless and scientific.\\" The news site frequently highlights deep politics, which Baker describes as \\"a vast, secret nexus of power and money that... the mainstream media dare not reveal because they are entwined in that same nexus.\\" Articles and reports from WhoWhatWhy have often been picked up by The Huffington Post, Business Insider and Alternet. = Family of Secrets = Baker's 2008 book Family of Secrets outlines historical connections of members of the Bush political dynasty, including Prescott Bush, President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush, to individuals in the Central Intelligence Agency, military- industrial complex and global financial system. In Family of Secrets, Baker asserts that George H. W. Bush was linked to the Watergate scandal and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Lev Grossman of Time magazine said that Baker \\"connects the dots between the Bushes and Watergate, which he far- fetchedly describes not as a ham-handed act of political espionage but as a carefully orchestrated farce designed to take down President Richard Nixon.\\"\\"Family of Secrets\\", review by Lev Grossman, Time Magazine, December 17, 2008. Family of Secrets contends that the first President Bush became an intelligence agent in his teenage years and was later at the center of a plot to assassinate Kennedy that included his father, Prescott Bush, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, CIA Director Allen Dulles, Cuban and Russian exiles and emigrants, and various Texas oilmen. It asserts that Bob Woodward of The Washington Post was an intelligence agent who conspired with John Dean to remove President Richard Nixon from office for opposing the oil depletion allowance. The book received scathing reviews. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, media critic Tim Rutten called the book a \\"dispiriting tome\\" that was an example of \\"paranoid literature.\\" He said that Baker \\"recklessly impugns, in the most disgusting possible way, the reputations not simply of men and women now dead, but of the living,\\" Rutten said that though George H.W. Bush was not likely to sue for libel, using a \\"tissue of innuendo, illogical inference, circumstance and guilt by tenuous association  as Baker does in this book  to indict rhetorically anyone, let alone a former chief executive, of an infamous murder is a reprehensible calumny.\\" = Journalistic approach = Baker lecturing at the Porcupine Freedom Festival in 2015 on \\"American Deep Power Structures\\" In a January 2015 profile, Boston magazine said that over the past decade, \\"Baker has abandoned the mainstream media and become a key player on the fringe, walking that murky line between conventional investigative journalist and wild-eyed conspiracy theorist.\\" Baker has raised questions about the Boston Marathon bombings, and \\"is not willing to rule out the possibility that the bombings were a false-flag operation conducted or permitted by elements of the American government in order to justify the Homeland Security complex.” He argues that FBI recruited the Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev as an agent or informant, which is the FBI has categorically denied. Boston said \\"it would be a lot easier to dismiss Baker as a nut and move on if it weren’t for his three decades of award-winning investigative-reporting experience.\\" Baker says he focuses on \\"deep politics\\" and engages in \\"forensic journalism\\" in which he digs deeper into stories than the mainstream media. Journalist Bill Moyers calls him an “indefatigable researcher from whom I could learn something about a subject that I hadn’t known. A Columbia Journalism Review profile observed that his critics reject his view that mainstream journalism fails to dig, say that \\"reporters are warned not to go farther than the evidence warrants, and they say that what Baker sees as audacity is just a cover for sloppy reporting.\\" Rutten said that Baker once may have been a serious and talented journalist but became “mesmerized by the idea of secrets and the Great Seduction. It causes you to lose your perspective and balance.” Baker has been on the adjunct faculty of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and was a contributing editor to the Columbia Journalism Review. He has appeared on C-SPAN, PBS affiliate stations, on RT, and on radio stations. (the first of four segments). He has received awards from the New York and Northern California chapters of the Society of Professional Journalists.

He is in his late fifties. Baker has declined to disclose his age, marital status, names of family members, or \\"anything that would make him more vulnerable to covert surveillance, intimidation, or worse.\\" He also declines to state where he lives or works because he does “sensitive investigative work” and doesn't want people showing up at his door.

It was filmed at Simi Valley, California, Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita, California as well as Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park in Agua Dulce, California. Plot A preacher (Kevin Sorbo) witnesses his family and a group of refugees seeking shelter in his church murdered by a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Colonel Cusack (Wings Hauser). After his wife makes him promise to never seek revenge, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he steps in to defend a woman in a saloon, the bad guy and his two friends (who happen to be allied with The Colonel), give him a beating and toss him into the street. A woman with a \\"past\\", named Maggie (Cynthia Watros), takes him in to care for him. He stays in her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home because she has a daughter. The local sheriff, on Cusacks's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run off some squatters. The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack. Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses. The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie. Unarmed still because of his agreement with Maggie, The Preacher catches the gang in the act and overcomes one of the men's guns, scaring the men off. The Preacher gets his gun back from Maggie and sets out to visit the Squatters again, and is met by the Sheriff and some of his gang. The Preacher, now armed, tells the Sheriff that the squatters have a right to stay. Gunfire ensues, and The Preacher shoots the sheriff. The rest of the bad guys run off. The Preacher then pays a visit to Cusack for a final showdown, and obtains the deed for the squatters. As he turns to leave, having satisfied his purpose for the visit, the Colonel tries to shoot him, but The Preacher is faster and kills Cusack. The Preacher returns to Maggie and her daughter.

Technocentrics argue that technology can address ecological problems through its problem-solving ability, efficiency, and its managerial means. Specifically, these capabilities allow humans control over nature, allowing them to correct or negotiate environmental risks or problems. Although technocentrics may accept that environmental problems exist, they do not see them as problems to be solved by a reduction in industry. Rather, environmental problems are seen as problems to be solved using rational, scientific and technological means. They also believe in scientific research. Indeed, technocentrics see the way forward for both developed and developing countries, and the solutions to environmental problems, as lying in scientific and technological advancement (sometimes referred to as sustainopreneurship). Origin of term The term was claimed to have been coined by Seymour Papert in 1987 as a combination of techno- and egocentrism: I coined the word technocentrism from Piaget's use of the word egocentrism. This does not imply that children are selfish, but simply means that when a child thinks, all questions are referred to the self, to the ego. Technocentrism is the fallacy of referring all questions to the technology. However, references to technocentrism date back well before this (see, for exampleO’Riordan, T. 1981. Environmentalism. Pion Books, London. andO’Riordan, T. 1981. Ecocentrism and Technocentrism. (pp. 32-40) In Smith, MJ (ed) Thinking through the Environment. A Reader. Open University Press, Routledge and Milton Keynes, London.). Among the earliest references cited by O'Riordan in his book \\"Environmentalism\\" (which includes extensive discussion of ecocentric and technocentric modes of thought) is that of Hays in 1959Hays, S. 1959. Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. where technocentrism is characterised as: > The application of rational and 'value-free' scientific and managerial > techniques by a professional elite, who regarded the natural environment as > 'neutral stuff' from which man could profitably shape his destiny.  Technocentrism vs ecocentrism  Technocentrism is often contrasted with ecocentrism. Ecocentrics, including deep ecologists, see themselves as being subject to nature, rather than in control of it. They lack faith in modern technology and the bureaucracy attached to it so they maintain responsibility for the environment. Ecocentrics will argue that the natural world should be respected for its processes and products and that low-impact technology and self-sufficiency is more desirable than technological control of nature. Fundamentally, ecocentrism maintains that concerns for the natural environment should dominate the needs of humankind, pitting it against the anthropocentric position of technocentrism, which pushes the needs of humans at the forefront even at the expense of everything else. There are theorists who claim that despite their incompatibilities, technocentrism and ecocentrism can be integrated into one framework because they share several similarities. For instance, it is proposed that technocentrism can facilitate ecocentrism, particularly in the area of policy-making, through shared goals and shared recycled resources. There is also the case of the so-called sustaincentric worldview, which was developed as a product of ecocentric and technocentric views.

The comune di Grosseto, encapsulating Marina, is the fourth most visited destination in Tuscany, only preceded by Florence, Pisa and Castiglione della Pescaia for tourist arrivals. Overview The town is situated around the center of San Rocco, and the first reports of a residential settlement, dates back to 1793 when Torre del Sale commissioned by Ferdinand III of Tuscany was finished. At that time, the village of San Rocco was one of the four guard posts established to protect the coast after the outbreak of fever, which had struck the city of Marseille in France. Because of its clean water Marina di Grosseto has received the Blue flag of FEEE (Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe) and in 2017 has also received the Green Flag for accessibility.

Background In the middle of the 19th century, Rochester, New York's need for transportationMonroe and Livingston Counties were, at the time, the nation's biggest wheat-producing area. Rochester milled as much as 5,000 barrels of flour a day, and the Rochester wheat trade moved an average of 1,200,000 bushels a year between 1845 and 1855. had not adequately been met by either the Genesee Valley Canal or the small local railroads that had been combined into the two major companies: the New York Central, with the Tonawanda, the Attica and Buffalo, and the Auburn and Rochester, and the Erie, with the Cohocton Valley and the Rochester and Genesee Valley lines. The actual purpose of the new railroad sought by the Rochester industrial and commercial interests was plain - provision of cheap and reliable transport of Pennsylvania coal to the city of Rochester. During the mid-1860s, the price of coal in Rochester had tripled. However, since the financial support of outlying farm and commercial interests was vital to the project, in one of the lesser deceptions of the railroad building era, it was intimated to the public in the towns and villages of the Genesee Valley that the road would be built through western New York in order to carry agricultural products to city markets. While Rochester came up with $600,000 by means of municipal bonds, rural communities raised nearly as much on their own. The organization of the new rail line, the Rochester and State Line Railroad, occurred on 8 April 1869. Purpose Energy for industry in western New York at this time came from Pennsylvania coal, and the existing railroads were the sole means of getting it to the Rochester area. The railroads knew this, and their pricing reflected it. In 1863, a ton of coal cost approximately six dollars. Two years later, it was seventeen dollars. Talk of conspiracies between the coal and the railroad companies and calls for a new railroad generated ample enthusiasm. For some ten years, coal customers, and others, from Rochester and villages as far south as the Pennsylvania line sought to raise interest in a new railroad to the level at which something could actually be accomplished. Genesis 150px Numerous meetings in both Rochester and the outlying southern areas led to many proposals, at least one of which came to fruition. Oliver Allen IIOne source erroneously gives his name as Owen Allen. and Donald McNaughton, both of Mumford, as well as Rochester attorney, D D S Brown, led a group of both business and government officials in promoting the project. In 1869, the Rochester and State Line Railroad was incorporated, chartered on 6 October to construct a railroad from Rochester to the Pennsylvania state line.The route specification included: Rochester, Scottsville, Mumford, Caledonia, Perry, Castile, Portageville, Belfast, Belmont, Wellsville, and thence along the Genesee River to the Pennsylvania line. Allen was elected vice-president of the new company. In the same year, the first surveys were made, by William Wallace, who had done the same thing for the Scottsville and LeRoy Railroad thirty-five years earlier. George Slocum writes in 1906: > \\"The Rochester and State Line Railroad in its inception was a Wheatland > institution.

Co. which name it now bears.\\" Although the initial state charter set the southern terminus at Wellsville, new coalfield discoveries in Pennsylvania spurred the organizers to move the route west, running through Warsaw and Ellicottville to Salamanca. This would facilitate an easier connection in Carrollton to the Buffalo, Bradford and Pittsburgh Railroad, and thus the coalfields of northern Pennsylvania. The anxiety with which small communities (in the days before a reliable highway network) sought rail connections may be inferred from the actions of Perry. Upon learning of the R&SL; plans not to connect with their village, local interests on 1 October 1868 set up their own railroad companyThis was the Silver Lake Railroad, not to be confused with the more real Silver Lake Railroad in New Hampshire. for a line from Perry to East Gainesville,Today, Silver Springs. where the Erie Railroad had a station. In the event, when the R&SL; was actually set up, Perry was on the route. However, when the route was shifted westward, Perry was off the route. Since interests along the original eastern route were now irate, yet another line, the Rochester and Pine Creek Railroad, was proposed to run from Caledonia to Castile, through Perry. Perry was unimpressed and decided to maintain their original intention. Barely a few years later, the Silver Lake Railroad merged into the Rochester and Pine Creek and, on 1 February 1872, opened a short line between East Gainesville and Perry. Five years later, this company renamed itself the Silver Lake Railway. A lamb between the wolves In the middle of the 19th century, two interests had essentially divided up the rail industry in New York State. Vanderbilt and the New York Central and Hudson River contended, often in dramatic terms, against Fisk, Gould, and Drew's Erie Railroad. The tie between the New York Central and the R&SL; can be inferred from the presence of George J Whitney on the boards of both companies. Vanderbilt had reason to want railroad access to the rich coal resources of Pennsylvania as well as wanting to acquire the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, which had a terminus at Salamanca. In 1872, Whitney started a two-year term as president of the RS&L;, strengthening the unwritten alliance with Vanderbilt.

In any event, the route lay-out was done by mid-1872. The official start occurred on 21 August 1872. As Allen was the driving force,It's never really that simple. Some of the directors of the corporation were affiliated with other railroads, including the New York Central and Hudson River, and their interests served both railroads, not just the one. In fact, at the end of the company's short life, there were five board members who also occupied seats on the board of the New York Central, including W H Vanderbilt, W K Vanderbilt, and Cornelius Vanderbilt himself. he did the first-shovel thing in Mumford. Actual construction work began in 1873 (some sources say 1874). By a year later, most of the route grading had been done. Up to the summer of 1873, work progressed rapidly, with the bed ready for rail-laying by mid-May, but the Panic of 1873Nationally, recovery from the panic did not occur until spring of 1879, when manufacturing industries revived and farm prices rose. brought the suspension of work on the line until the corporation's directors were able to arrange with Waterman & Beaver of Philadelphia for enough iron rails to complete the line from Rochester to LeRoy. Rails at that time were selling for $88.00 a ton. 7 October 1873 saw the first rail spiked to the cross-ties in a ceremony at Lincoln Park, the line reaching Scottsville by November, Garbuttsville shortly thereafter, and Le Roy by year's end. The Rochester to Le Roy segment of the road was opened in May 1874. On 15 September 1874, the first regular train on the Rochester and State Line Railroad reached Le Roy. Unfortunately, little or no work was done in the following two years, as the company's financial resources had been exhausted. By the end of 1876, the railroad line had been taken as far as Pearl Creek.A hamlet near the north town line on Route 19 in Wyoming County. In June 1877, the line reached Warsaw.Regrettably, no one at the time saw fit to compose a concerto with which to mark the occasion. In an early example of the appropriately-named fast-track construction technique, a second crew built the southern part of the road, south out of Machias to Salamanca and north to the line built by the first crew. The south-bound work from Machias reached Salamanca on 28 January 1878; on 9 January, the line north from Machias and south from Rochester met in the town of Eagle. Now a respectable 108 miles long, the Rochester and State Line Railroad began revenue service along its full length on 16 May 1878. The cowboy atmosphere of 19th century railroading was reflected in an incident involving the Erie Railroad. When the RS&L; construction crew needed to cross the Erie's tracks in Le Roy, they simply built a level junction and kept going. The Erie took exception to this and tore up the crossing. While cooler heads prevailed in May 1877, the construction crew cared little, as they were already south of the Erie's line. The end of 1876 took the line as far as Pearl Creek, with Warsaw reached in June 1877. Completion occurred in very early 1878.

The northern terminus of the route was Lincoln Park, in southwest Rochester. To this day, it has a rail yard and junction and has figured prominently in the area's rail history.

Image:RochesterAndStateLine8.jpgRochester and State Line Railway advertising poster, circa 1878 Image:RochesterAndStateLine9.jpgRochester and State Line Railway first route map, circa 1878 In 1874, the Rochester and State Line Railroad connected Rochester and Le Roy, although little traffic came to or from many small agricultural and industrial villages, thanks to the Great Depression of 1873-1879. Near the end of the depression, in 1878, the railroad had reached Salamanca, but the return to prosperity eluded many. The freight carried by the new line varied. Initially, farm produce and lumber comprised the revenue loads, and this did not materially change until the line reached Salamanca. Then, crude oil became the dominant load, with solid trains of tankers running north to Rochester. In the end, it did not carry significant quantities of coal, and this figured in its economic failure when the oil business declined. Unlike the standardization prevalent today, the lines of the 1870s used a number of gauges, necessitating some means of allowing interchange of rolling stock. The Rochester and State Line Railroad faced this in Salamanca at its interchange with the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, with its gauge. The Ramsey car transfer device solved the problem, although it did little for the inconvenience until the A&GW; saw the light of reason and adopted the . Like a great many rail companies, the R&SL; experienced fiscal embarrassment from time to time. During the construction of the Salamanca line, management devised a means of protecting the locomotives and cars from the tax collectors when back taxes began to accumulate. They sold the rolling stock to themselves, removing it from the tax collectors' reach, eventually selling the equipment back to the railroad when the pressure eased. Rolling stock At the inception of operations, the R&SL; had two locomotives, purchased from Brooks Locomotive Works in 1873. The two brightly decorated 4-4-0 engines weighed some thirty tons each and were named the \\"Rochester\\" and the \\"Salamanca\\". Additionally, the company utilized twenty-five flatcars, a boxcar, a baggage car, and two passenger cars. All subsequent locomotives were named in honour of company founders and management. They, too, were Brooks 4-4-0 engines and were kept looking sharp. The company acquired Numbers 3 and 4 in 1876, Number 5 in 1877, and 6 through 11 in the following year. Matters were different at the end. When the R&SL; was folded up and sold off, it had eleven deteriorated locomotives, two hundred sixty-eight tired cars, and shops that were barely usable. The trackage was worn, and the bridges were not much better. Accidents Only paper railroads never have accidents, and the Rochester and State Line Railroad was no paper tiger. Some of the accident accounts surviving to this day leave much unsaid, such as the 13 June 1878 report that Locomotive No 7 ran over two cows between Salamanca and Gainesville on its very first trip. Others are frighteningly graphic (by today's tame standards) and could have been taken from cheap Hollywood scripts. Case in point: on or about 29 January 1879, Train No 2 departed Salamanca headed for Ellicottville when its encounter with a washout tossed the locomotive into the water. The fireman managed to escape the wreckage, but the engineer was caught by one foot trapped between the reversing lever and the firebox. He desperately struggled to keep his head above water and to avoid a stream of very hot water coming from a burst pipe in the cab. By the time he was rescued hours later, the water had risen to his chin. In another story that might have come from the Keystone Kops, had it not taken the ex- cop's life, a policeman-turned-brakeman fell off a train in 1879 and was found only after the crew discovered him missing and went back along the line to find him. 1879 proved a costly year for three carriage riders in Mumford who strayed in front of an on-coming train at the Brown Cut, west of the hamlet. The driver of the carriage claimed not to have seen the train until too late; when he whipped the horse ahead to avoid it, the horse cleared the tracks but the carriage did not. He suffered serious injury; one young woman was caught on the pilot and carried halfway to the Spring Creek bridge before the train stopped. She survived, essentially uninjured. The second young woman was thrown seven yards by the impact of the 20 mile an hour train and died in minutes from massive head trauma. In the days of primitive signals, or none at all, collisions often occurred. The heavy fogs of Cattaraugus Valley frequently overcame the feeble lights on cabooses, and faster trains ran into slower ones. On 26 August 1879, a coupler failed on an oil train three miles north of Salamanca, breaking the train in two. The latter half rolled to a stop, shortly whereafter the next train smashed into it. The brakeman on the stopped cars died, and the engineer of the second train escaped with serious injuries. On bad days, the collisions were head-on, when one train would take a single track from which another had not yet cleared. The structural weaknesses of the rolling stock of the day led to trains breaking in two. A coupler might fail on a car in the middle of the train, and - as this was before the automatic brakes used today - one half of the train would chart its own course. Given the wrong terrain, this sometimes sent a string of cars rolling backward downhill out of control, with predictable results. Demise The entertaining fictions that the railroad had been built to serve the rural communities along its route and existed to carry coals to Rochester could not hide the fact that it was a pawn of the Vanderbilts. By 1879, William H Vanderbilt owned most of its stock, and several other Vanderbilts served on its board. Thus, it was a de facto if not a de jure branch of the New York Central Railroad. In a painful irony, the shipment of coal never amounted to much, and even the temporarily lucrative transportation of oil soon ended, due to competition by the Erie. The company was not financially successful. Revenue was inadequate; even debt service could not be maintained. The Vanderbilts no longer found the R&SL; particularly attractive, their attention being occupied elsewhere.The Atlantic and Great Western no longer interested them, nor did they wish access to the Bradford coalfields. It went into oblivion when it defaulted on its bonds. Foreclosure proceedings began on 6 February 1880, with receivership on 21 February. In November, the entire equity of the railroad, including the stock owned by the Vanderbilts, was acquired by a syndicate in New York City. Headed by Walston H Brown,Also a member of the Seney Syndicate. it paid $600,000 on 20 January 1881. One commentator has attributed the failure of this company not to a bad idea or an inadequate market demand for its services but to insufficient capitalization and backers who did not greatly care. If anything, he has characterized the R&SL; as the seed for a much better attempt, one which, with a false start, eventually succeeded. On 29 January 1881, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad was created from the remains of the Rochester and State Line Railroad. Four years later, that line succumbed to bankruptcy and was acquired by Adrian Iselin, at one time a director of the Rochester and Pittsburgh. He broke the company into two, the Pennsylvania operations as the Pittsburgh and State Line Railroad Company, and the New York part as the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad. The BR&P; would go on to be one of the more successful and useful of the region's railroads.

Opera Mary Queen of Scotts (c. 1578), by Nicholas Hilliard, depicts Queen Mary in captivity. She was a regular topic of 19th century European opera. The subject of Mary, Queen of Scots was a common one in 19th century opera. Usually, the operas dealt with the period of her life when she was being persecuted by Elizabeth I of England. Mary was considered a sympathetic character in southern Europe due to her Catholicism. Mary's story proved popular among liberals and revolutionaries in 19th-century Italy. These were especially attracted by the various plots made to save her as well as her death as a political martyr, both of which they interpreted as comparable to their own struggle. The Carbonari took their name from a mythical ring of English coal-burners, supposedly dedicated to Mary's cause. For this reason, the subject of Mary Stuart came to be seen as a concern of radicals, and operas about her were banned on several occasions. Nineteenth-century operas about Mary include: * Luigi Carlini – Maria Stuarda, regina di Scozia (1818) * Pietro Casella – Maria Stuarda (1812) * Carlo Coccia – Maria Stuart, regina di Scozia (1827) * Gaetano Donizetti – Maria Stuarda (1835) * François-Joseph Fétis – Marie Stuart en Ecosse (1823) * Saverio Mercadante – Maria Stuarda, regina di Scozia (1825) * Louis Niedermeyer – Marie Stuart (1844), Paris * – Maria Stuarda ossia I carbonari di Scozia (1816) Twentieth-century operas about Mary include: *Mary Carr Moore - David Rizzio (completed in 1932, on an Italian libretto) *Thea Musgrave - Mary, Queen of Scots (premiered in 1977 in Edinburgh) *Bain Murray - ‘’Mary Stuart, A Queen Betrayed’’ (1991) Radio * Joan Crawford played Mary in the March 10, 1937 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of the film Mary of Scotland, with Franchot Tone as Bothwell and Judith Anderson as Elizabeth. * Episode 14 of the Australian radio series Famous Escapes is \\"Mary Queen of Scots Escapes from Prison\\" (1945); the actress who played Mary is not currently known. * Another version of the Mary of Scotland play was broadcast on the Theatre Guild on the Air on April 28, 1946, starring Helen Hayes as Mary and Helen Menken as Elizabeth (both of whom had originally played their roles on Broadway). * On June 10, 1947, the radio series Favorite Story broadcast \\"Mary Queen of Scots\\", the \\"favorite story\\" of Bing Crosby, with Edna Best as Mary and Benita Hume as Elizabeth. * The CBS Radio series You Are There broadcast \\"The Execution of Mary Queen of Scots\\" on June 27th 1947, June 27th 1948 and April 3rd 1949. * Meg Fraser played Mary twice in BBC Radio 3 productions, first in 2010 in Jo Clifford's adaptation of Madame de La Fayette's novel La Princesse de Cleves and then in 2012 in David Harrower's adaptation of Friedrich Schiller's play Mary Stuart. * A radio adaptation of Liz Lochhead's play Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 11 February 2011, with Gerda Stevenson as Mary and Myra McFadyen as Corbie. * Jeany Spark played Mary in Episode One, \\"It Came In with a Lass\\" (29 June 2013), of the first series of Mike Walker's BBC Radio 4's The Stuarts. * On 8 December 2018, BBC Radio 4 broadcast as part of their Unmade Movies series Alexander MacKendrick's Mary Queen of Scots, adapted from the original screenplay by Alexander MacKendrick and Jay Presson Allen, with Ellie Bamber as Mary and Glenda Jackson as The Narrator. Television * In the Channel 4 television miniseries, Elizabeth I (2005), the first two-hour segment partly centers around the conflict between Elizabeth and Mary (portrayed by Barbara Flynn), whose execution is graphically shown in a manner that is reportedly true to history. * In the Channel 5 television docudrama series Elizabeth I (2017), Mary is portrayed by Audrey L'Ebrellec. * The BBC- TV mini-series Elizabeth R (1971), episode 4: \\"Horrible Conspiracies\\", written by Hugh Whitemore, is a generally historically accurate portrayal of Mary (played by Vivian Pickles) during her captivity in England, from her imprisonment at Chartley under the guardianship of Sir Amyas Paulet through to her trial and execution, using many of Mary's own reported words as dialogue. It includes an accurate portrayal of her execution including her use of a red petticoat (red being the colour of martyrdom in the Catholic religion), her positioning of her head with her hands on the block, and the two blows and sawing motion it took to remove her head. It also shows the executioner unwittingly grasping and pulling away her wig to reveal her grey hair. * The BBC television miniseries Gunpowder, Treason & Plot (2004) dramatizes the reigns of Scottish monarchs Mary, Queen of Scots (played by French actress Clémence Poésy) and her son King James VI of Scotland, who became King James I of England and foiled the Gunpowder Plot. * In the CBBC sketch show Horrible Histories (2009–2015), Mary is portrayed by Martha Howe-Douglas and Jessica Ransom. * An episode of the British series Lovejoy (\\"The Colour of Mary\\", series 4) finds the main character seeking information and the whereabouts of Mary's pool table. * Monty Python's Flying Circus episode 22 (1970) features a skit involving the first two episodes of \\"a new radio drama series: The Death of Mary Queen of Scots\\". * Lesley Smith, the curator of Tutbury Castle, portrayed Mary Queen of Scots for Living's Most Haunted in 2002 for a dramatic monologue of her time imprisoned there. Smith continues these re-enactments in the castle. * Reign (2013 TV series) is a highly fictionalized period drama television show on The CW Television Network that follows the life of 15-year- old Mary, Queen of Scots, at French court beginning in 1557, while she awaits her marriage to Francis II of France. At court, Mary has to contend with the changing politics and power plays. Francis' mother, Queen Catherine de' Medici, is secretly trying to prevent the marriage due to the advice of Nostradamus, who had a vision that the wedding will lead to Francis' death. The series also follows the affairs of Mary's four Scottish handmaidens Lola, Kenna, Greer and Aylee, who are searching for husbands of their own at court. Mary is portrayed by Australian actress Adelaide Kane. The series began airing on October 13, 2013. * A 1957 episode of the Wonderful World of Disney titled, \\"The Truth About Mother Goose\\", discussed the origins of three nursery rhymes. Series host Walt Disney attributed the Mary Mary Quite Contrary rhyme to the life of Mary Stuart. This episode featured a brief animated short about Mary's life, done in the artistic style of Sleeping Beauty. The short touched on important moments in Mary's life, even ending with a scene of Mary being marched to her beheading. * In an episode of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Mary is referenced when two fictional knights were said to have served her. Theatre =18th and 19th centuries= Mary, Queen of Scots, captured the imagination of Italian radicals and their fellow travellers as a political symbol. The restless interest in this tormented figure resulted in multiple 18th and 19th century plays, such as: * Maria Stuarda (1778), an historical play by Count Vittorio Alfieri * Mary, Queen of Scots; An Historical Tragedy, Or, Dramatic Poem (1792) by Mary Deverell * Mary Stuart by Alexandre Dumas *Il Trionfo dei Carbonari (1802) by Camillo Federici, the pseudonym of Giovanni Battista Viassolo.

It consisted of schools in California and Utah. The charter members of the conference were California Polytechnic State University; California State University, Northridge; California State University, Sacramento; the University of California, Davis; and Southern Utah University. The conference comprised schools from the old Western Football Conference that had recently made the move from NCAA Division II to NCAA Division I. The conference was founded on July 15, 1993, as an NCAA Division I-AA football-only conference. It added additional sports a year later. The members were prompted to move their programs in response to an NCAA ruling barring member institutions from competing in football at a lower level than other sports. The only commissioner of the American West Conference was Vic Buccola who had been the athletic director at Cal Poly from 1973 to 1981, and commissioner of the Western Football Conference from 1981 to 1992. History =1993-94: I-AA football only= UC Davis and Southern Utah tied for the 1993 AWC football championship with 3–1 records. Although UC Davis was a conference member, the team was listed in Division II polls, and participated in the Division II postseason. =1994–95= UC Davis left the AWC after the 1993 season, leaving Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Cal State Northridge, Sacramento State, Southern Utah for the 1994-95 season. In the 1994-95 season, the AWC sponsored men's and women's cross country, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's track and field, and women's tennis, in addition to football. The AWC did not have an automatic bid to the NCAA championships since the NCAA requires a conference to have six teams. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo won the 1994 AWC football championship. =1995-96= The 1995-96 season was the last season of the AWC. Cal Poly accepted an invitation to the Big West Conference. Cal State Northridge and Sacramento State accepted invitations to the Big Sky Conference. Southern Utah became an independent until they became members of the Mid-Continent Conference, now called the Summit League, in 1997. By winning the 400 Meter Intermediate Hurdle championship races in both 1995 and 1996, David Baeza became the only Men's 400IH American West Conference Champion in history. He also won the 1996 400m Dash Championship race after finishing 3rd in the 1995 championship race. =Aftermath= Cal State Northridge left the Big Sky for the Big West in 2001. That year, they operated as a I-AA independent in football, and in 2002 their football program was dropped. UC Davis made the decision to move up to Division I in 2003, and in 2007 they joined Cal State Northridge and Cal Poly in the Big West. Former AWC members UC Davis, Cal Poly, and Southern Utah would later found the Great West Football Conference (later renamed the Great West Conference), along with newcomers Northern Colorado, North Dakota State, and South Dakota State from the North Central Conference, as a home for their football programs at the I-AA level in 2004. This conference remained small much like the AWC for its entire existence, ranging from only 5 to 6 football members at any given time. In late 2010, the Big Sky Conference announced it would add UC Davis and Cal Poly as football-only members, as well as Southern Utah as a full member, thus reuniting these schools with Sacramento State in football. This move effectively dissolved the Great West as a football-sponsoring conference.

Early history Shoni was christened John Jones. Although police records state that he was born in Merthyr Tydfil, the name Sguborfawr was a farm near the village of Penderyn which is situated just a couple of miles away from Merthyr; he also worked as a farm labourer in the Penderyn area, so this may have been his true birthplace. Little is known about his education, however he was able to read and write to a certain extent. His occupation shifts constantly, as well as a farm hand he is recorded by some as a shaft sinker and others a brass fitter. He later joined the 98th Foot Regiment working for the authorities in Monmouthshire, and at one point was working in Brecon as a special constable during a Brecknock election. Before he reached 30, Shoni had made a name for himself as a hard man, and was seen as one of the toughest men in 'China', which was an undesirable area of Merthyr where the worst and most desperate of an industrial society found themselves.Old Merthyr Tydfil 'China' In 1840, the arrival of the Taff Vale Railway, which made Merthyr the industrial steel manufacturing hub of Britain, was celebrated in 'China' with a bare-knuckle boxing contest between Sguborfawr and Cyfarthfa champion, John Nash.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg78  The Rebecca Riots  In 1843, Sguborfawr went before the Merthyr Magistrates for being drunk and disorderly and brawling in the streets. He escaped a prison sentence, but he was soon in front of the Swansea Magistrates on an identical charge. After these encounters with the magistrates Sguborfawr found work in the village of Pontyberem where he was then hired to take part in the Rebecca Riots. His main acts during the riots were the destruction of turnpike gates, and on 25 August, he was involved in drunken brawling in Pontyberem. After the riots, Sguborfawr began using extortion to gain money from several farmers, stating he would reveal them to be Rebecca Rioters. He was arrested in Tumble in September for shooting a man at the New Inn in Pontyberem, and in December was sentenced to be transported from Britain. Though after his sentence was read, he laughed and revealed the names of some of his criminal associates. Sguborfawr was first placed in Carmarthen jail (Carchar Caerfyrddin) before being moved to Millbank Penitentiary in 1844. There, he was housed with fellow convicted rioter David Davies, but the men were separated when Sguborfawr was transported on the Blunell, reaching Norfolk Island on 6 July. He remained at the penitentiary station on the island until 8 April 1847 when he was transferred to Van Diemens Land, Tasmania. Although placed with several masters, much like his trouble making in Britain, Sguborfawr continued to be anti-social and aggressive; this time his acts included stealing along with being drunk and disorderly. He was awarded a ticket of leave in 1856, and was conditionally pardoned in 1858.

He served in Salonika from 1916–18 and achieved the rank of Lieutenant. He resumed his law career on return to Britain and was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1919.Who was Who, Oxford University Press, 2007 Politics =Election to Parliament= By the time of the 1918 general election Guest had become one of Lloyd George's closest advisers and his patronage must have been useful to Lewis in securing the nomination to become Coalition Liberal candidate for the Pontypridd Division of Glamorgan. It is not clear if Lewis was the recipient of the Coalition Coupon as he was opposed by a Conservative candidate at Pontypridd as well as by Labour. However the anti-socialist votes clearly migrated to Lewis as the Tory managed only 1.1% of the poll and lost his deposit. Lewis was elected with a majority 3,175 votes.F.W.S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949, p. 562 =Welsh Liberal MP= Lewis spoke Welsh and English and spoke in Parliament in favour of Welsh Home RuleThe Times, 5 June 1919, p. 19 as part of a debate on a resolution moved by Edward Wood the future Lord Halifax to set up a committee of enquiry on federal devolution to all the home countries. As a result of the debate, which was supported by the Welsh members present, Lloyd George established a Speaker's Conference on Devolution which sat from October 1919 – May 1920.K. O. Morgan, Wales in British Politics 1868–1922; University of Wales Press, 1963, pp. 291–292) Lewis championed the rights of nonconformists in relation to the position of the Established church.The Times, 18 November 1918, p. 12 As a Liberal, Lewis strongly disagreed with the state socialist approach of the Labour Party. He was a member of the Liberal Anti-Nationalization CommitteeThe Times, 27 April 1920, p. 14 but was in favour of co-partnership and profit sharing in industry.The Times, 30 July 1920, p. 12 =Parliamentary appointments= Soon after entering Parliament, Lewis was rewarded for his service to his former chief with his appointment as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Freddie Guest, who had been government Chief Whip since 1917.The Times, 30 January 1919, p. 9 When, in 1921, Guest was made Secretary of State for Air in succession to Winston Churchill he appointed Lewis his PPS in succession to Lieutenant-Colonel J T C Moore-Brabazon.The Times, 23 September 1921, p.11 In 1922, Lewis was appointed a Junior Lord of the Treasury to enable him to be the government's Welsh whip but under the constitutional arrangements of the day this meant he had to resign and fight a by-election in his Pontypridd seat.The Times, 5 July 1922, p. 10 The by-election took place on 25 July 1922 and was a straight fight between Lewis and Thomas Isaac Mardy Jones for Labour. Lewis' majority of 3,175 at the 1918 general election was turned into a Labour majority of 4,080 at the by-election. Mardy Jones put his victory down to the disillusion of the electorate with the government's performance but also singled out what he clearly believed was the government's poor treatment of the coal miners.The Times, 27 July 1922, p. 10 =University of Wales Member of Parliament= Lewis was not out of Parliament for long. The 1922 general election took place on 15 November, and by then Lewis had secured adoption as the Lloyd George, National Liberal candidate for the University of Wales Parliamentary constituency. By this time Lewis was in poor health despite being relatively young at 41 years old. He contested the election from a nursing home.The Times, 20 July 1923, p. 14 He won the seat defeating two strong opponents.F.W.S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949, p. 672 Former minister Sir Ellis Ellis-Griffith stood for the Liberals. The Labour candidate was Dr (later Dame) Olive Wheeler, a university lecturer in education who later became Professor of Education at Cardiff University.Biodata Death Lewis died suddenly in London on 18 July 1923, aged 41, eight months after his return to parliament. He had been in poor health and undergone operations in August 1922 and at Easter 1923 after leaving the nursing home where he had stayed in 1922,The Times obituary, 20 July 1923, p. 12 possibly leaving him susceptible to infection.

His work is distinguished by a mixture of realism and luminism, favoring industrial and working scenes, but always imbued with atmospheric light. Geographically, his career spanned the length of the eastern Atlantic and beyond. Childhood and education Stephen Etnier was born in September, 1903 in York, Pennsylvania. From 1915 to 1922 he attended the Haverford and Hill schools in Pennsylvania and Roxbury Tutoring School in Connecticut. He matriculated into Yale University class of 1926, transferring to Yale Art School in December 1922. Re-entering Yale University in 1923 he was later dismissed for poor grades. He entered Haverford College in 1924 and transferred to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied for four years. From 1925 through 1929 he studied and apprenticed under the artists Henry Breckinridge, Rockwell Kent and John Carroll. Early career Drawing inspiration from The Moon and Sixpence, Somerset Maugham's novel based on the life of the painter Paul Gauguin, Etnier pursued painting, launching his career with a solo exhibition at Dudensing Galleries, New York City in 1931. He soon moved to New York's Milch Gallery, where he would remain until the 1960s. Etnier's early work of 1930s and 1940s provides a record of his life at the time. His work shows street scenes in his home state of Pennsylvania, waterfronts from his travels to Haiti and the Bahamas, (and made while sailing the Eastern Seaboard aboard his 70-foot sailboat, Morgana), aerial perspectives created as he learned to fly, and dramatic Maine landscapes, painted while he renovated a stately 1862 home, \\"Gilbert Head\\". Gilbert Head was on Long Island, Maine at the opening of the Kennebec River and across from Fort Popham and Popham Beach. Etnier and his wife Betsy lived on the Morgana for two years while they renovated the house. Her account of these years, On Gilbert Head, was published in 1937. In 1938 he executed the mural \\"Waiting for the Mail,\\" installed at the U.S. Post Office in Spring Valley, New York, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. In 1940 he painted a second mural, \\"Mail for New England\\" at the Boston, MA. Everett Branch Post Office. In 2010 this mural was restored and reinstalled at the Clarendon Street Post Office in Boston. Military service In 1941, at the age of thirty-eight, Etnier suspended his painting career to serve in the United States Navy. In May 1942, Etnier was commissioned as a lieutenant and assigned as commanding officer of the USS Mizpah, a North Atlantic convoy escort ship. In 1944, he was reassigned to the USS Tourmaline in Boston, and later to the USS General Omar Bundy in San Francisco. He completed his tour of duty in 1945. Later career Etnier purchased land in South Harpswell, Maine in 1948 to build \\"Old Cove\\", his dream house and studio. Designed in collaboration with Portland, Maine architect James Saunders, the home featured a porch cantilevered over the ocean, north-facing windows for his studio, and a living room overlooking the ocean and framed by Mondrian-inspired window frames. Named for the private cove it overlooked, the home served as the foundation for a productive and increasingly serene period in Etnier's career. Old Cove was sold to new owners in 2014 and subsequently demolished. The 1950s and 1960s mark a maturing, accomplished style in Etnier's work. Although still traveling south most winters in his boat, his life took a more domestic turn as he re-adopted Maine as his permanent home and married his fourth wife, Samuella \\"Brownie\\" Brown Rose. They were married for thirty-three years and had two sons. During those years, he painted daily, exhibited widely and enjoyed popular support, artistic awards and media attention. Etnier's work became more architectural, marked by stark geometry, light and shadow, impressionistic figures and accents of color and modern culture. He adopted an artist's discipline of rising early and painting each morning (learned first from Rockwell Kent ), seeking to capture the essence of Maine waterfronts and landscapes and the effects of light. The study of sunlight and water fascinated Etnier until the end of his career. On November 7, 1984, Stephen Etnier died at Old Cove, comforted by his two sons.

John Archer, elected mayor of Battersea in 1913, had been thought to be the first black British mayor. However, in reporting Archer's election, the American Negro Year Book 1914 (founded by Monroe Work) recorded that: > In 1904, Mr. , a colored man from the West Indies, was elected mayor of the > borough of Thetford, Norfolk.

His eldest brother, Dr Pembroke Minns (1840–1912), was already in medical practice in Thetford when he moved there. He was one of nine children of John Minns (1811–1863) and Ophelia ( Bunch, 1817 – 1902).

These dynamic rectangles begin with a square, which is extended (using a series of arcs and cross points) to form the desired figure, which can be the golden rectangle (1 : 1.618...), the 2:3 rectangle, the double square (1:2), or a root rectangle (1:, 1:, 1:, 1:, etc.).SKINNER, Stephen, Sacred Geometry Deciphering the Code, New York City: Sterling Publishing Company, 2006, pp. 53 Root rectangles Hambidge's 1920 illustration of the construction of root rectangles.

A root rectangle is a rectangle in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the square root of an integer, such as , , etc. The root-2 rectangle (ACDK in Fig. 10) is constructed by extending two opposite sides of a square to the length of the square's diagonal. The root-3 rectangle is constructed by extending the two longer sides of a root-2 rectangle to the length of the root-2 rectangle's diagonal. Each successive root rectangle is produced by extending a root rectangle's longer sides to equal the length of that rectangle's diagonal.Jay Hambidge. (1926, 1948, 1967)The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry. Courier Dover Publications. pp. 9–10. =Properties= *When a root-N rectangle is divided into N congruent rectangles by dividing the longer edge into N segments, the resulting figures keep the root-N proportion (as illustrated above). *The root-3 rectangle is also called sixton,Wim Muller (2001) Order and Meaning in Design. Lemma Publishers, p. 49. and its short and longer sides are proportionally equivalent to the side and diameter of a hexagon. *Since 2 is the square root of 4, the root-4 rectangle has a proportion 1:2, which means that it is equivalent to two squares side-by-side. *The root-5 rectangle is related to the golden ratio (φ). The longer side is equal to one plus two times 1/φ (0.618...). Root-φ rectangle A root-phi rectangle divides into a pair of Kepler triangles (right triangles with edge lengths in geometric progression). The root-φ rectangle is a dynamic rectangle but not a root rectangle. Its diagonal equals φ times the length of the shorter side. If a root-φ rectangle is divided by a diagonal, the result is two congruent Kepler triangles. Jay Hambidge Jay Hambidge, as part of his theory of dynamic symmetry, includes the root rectangles in what he calls dynamic rectangles, which have irrational and geometric fractions as ratios, such as the golden ratio or square roots. Hambidge distinguishes these from rectangles with rational proportions, which he terms static rectangles. According to him, root-2, 3, 4 and 5 rectangles are often found in Gothic and Classical Greek and Roman art, objects and architecture, while rectangles with aspect ratios greater than root-5 are seldom found in human designs. According to Matila Ghyka, Hambidge's dynamic rectangles Caskey's 1922 illustration of the property that a root-N rectangle divides into N reciprocal rectangles of the same proportions.  The 12 orthogons of Wersin  According to Wolfgang von Wersin's The Book of Rectangles, Spatial Law and Gestures of The Orthogons Described (1956), a set of 12 special orthogons (from the Gr. ορθος, orthos, \\"straight\\"\\"Ortho-\\", Oxford dictionary of current English, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 627, 1071 p. and γονια, gonia, \\"angle\\"; \\"a right angled figure\\", which, as a consequence, is rectangular and tetragonalCURTIS, Thomas, The London Encyclopaedia, 1829, pp. 356) has been used historically by artists, architects and calligraphers to guide the placement and interaction of elements in a design.WERSIN, Wolfgang Von, Das Buch vom Rechteck Gesetz und Gestik des Raumlichen die Othogone-scheibe. Die Orthogone-scheibe (The Book of Rectangles, Spatial Law and Gestures of The Orthogons Described. The Orthogons Described), Ravensburg: Otto Maier Verlag Publishers, 1956 These orthogons are:WERSIN, pp. 83 * Square (1:1 or 1:) * Diagon (1:) * Hecton or sixton (1:) * Doppelquadrat (1:2 or 1:) * Hemiolion (2:3) * Auron (the golden rectangle, 1:φ) * Hemidiagon (1:½) * Penton (1:) * Trion (1:⅔) * Quadriagon (1:(1+)/2) * Biauron (1:2φ) * Bipenton (1:2) Wolfgang von Wersin's book includes an extraordinary copy of text from the year 1558 (Renaissance), with diagrams of seven of the 12 orthogons and an invitation from the passage to pay careful attention as the \\"ancient\\" architects believed \\"nothing excels these proportions\\" as \\"a thing of the purest abstraction.\\"WERSIN, op. cit., pp. 36 All 12 orthogons, when formed together, create an entire unit: a square that is developed into a double square.WERSIN, pp. 80 Perhaps the most popular among the ortogons is the auron or golden rectangle, which is produced by projecting the diagonal that goes from the middle point of a side of a square to one of the opposite vertexes, until it is aligned with the middle point. Four of these orthogons are harmonic rectangles: the diagon or root-2 rectangle is produced by projecting the diagonal of a square; the sixton, hecton or root-3 rectangle is produced by projecting the diagonal of a diagon; the double square or root-4 rectangle is produced by projecting the diagonal of an hecton; the root-5 rectangle is produced by projecting the diagonal of a double square (or by projecting 180° both diagonals that go from the middle point of a side of a square to the opposite vertexes). Two of the most complicated of these figures are; the penton, with proportions 1: is related to the section of the golden pyramid, the bipenton's longer side is equal to the shorter multiplied by two thirds of the square root of three, longer side of the biauron is - 1 or 2τ times the shorter. The quadriagon is related to the diagon in the sense that its longer side is produced by projecting the diagonal of a quarter of a square. The trion has the height of an equilateral triangle and the width of the side. The hemidiagon (1:½) longer side is half the one of the root-5 rectangle and is produced by projecting the diagonal of half a square until it is perpendicular with the origin. Besides the square and the double square, the only other static rectangle included in the list is the hemiolion, which is produced by projecting 90° or 180° half the side of a square. = Constructing an orthogon = The dimensions of orthogons relate to each other and to the Orthogon as a whole. For this reason, use of Orthogons as a template or under-structure is of interest to artists, architects and designers.http://www.constructingtheuniverse.com/Volume4.html Orthogons always begin with a square, any square. Once an individual Orthogon is constructed, additional related measurements are determined (small, medium, large). These measurements can then be used to guide the design (painting, architecture, pottery, furniture, calligraphy, auto, etc.). Diagrams for all twelve orthogons are available. Wersin's book has very detailed explanations for creating individual Orthogons.WERSIN, pp. 82-85 The measurements derived are then applied in a design. The artwork of Giorgio Morandi exemplifies how measurements of varying sizes (derived from an Orthogon) can create visual harmony. = Orthogons and design = Use of dimensions related to an orthogon as an under-structure system (or template for a design) ensures that the various parts will relate to the design as a whole. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio in Book Three of \\"De Architectura\\" (known currently as \\"The Ten Books of Architecture\\") explains: > \\"Therefore, since nature has designed the human body so that its members are > duly proportioned to the frame as a whole, it appears that the ancients had > good reason for their rule, that in perfect buildings the different members > must be in exact symmetrical relations to the whole general scheme. Hence, > while transmitting to us the proper arrangements for buildings of all kinds, > they were particularly careful to do so in the case of temples of the gods, > buildings in which merits and faults usually last forever.\\" Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is an illustration of the concept of parts relating to the work as a whole.HEMENWAY, pp. 95 References Further reading * Hemenway, Priya; Divine Proportion, Phi in Art, Nature and Science; 2005, Sterling Publishing Co., Inc, NY, NY.

Horses in East Asian warfare are inextricably linked with the strategic and tactical evolution of armed conflict. A warrior on horseback or horse-drawn chariot changed the balance of power between civilizations. When people with horses clashed with those without, horses provided a huge advantage. When both sides had horses, battles turned on the strength and strategy of their mounted horsemen, or cavalry. Military tactics were refined in terms of the use of horses (cavalry tactics).American Museum of Natural History (AMNH): \\"The Horse,\\" warfare. Japanese samurai prepare to man fortifications against Mongol invaders, painted c. 1293 As in most cultures, a war horse in East Asia was trained to be controlled with limited use of reins, responding primarily to the rider's legs and weight.Equestrian Federation of Australia: Dressage Explained. Horses were significant factors in the Han-Hun Wars and Wuhu incursions against past kingdoms of China,Goodrich, L. Carrington. (1959). and the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia and into Europe;Nicolle, Medieval Warfare Source Book: Christian Europe and its Neighbors, pp. 91-94. and they played a part in military conflicts on a smaller, more localized scale. Horse warfare in national contexts =China= Ceramic statues of a prancing horse (foreground) and a cavalryman on horseback (background), Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD) A sancai lead-glazed earthenware horse statue with a saddle, Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) There were horse-driven chariots of the Shang (c. 1600 - c. 1050 BC) and Zhou (c. 1050 - 256 BC) periods, but horseback riding in China, according to David Andrew Graff, was not seen in warfare prior to the 4th century BC.Graff, David Andrew. (2002). King Wuling of Zhao (340 BCE-295 BCE), after realizing the advantages of light cavalry warfare over that of the heavy and cumbersome chariots, instituted reforms generally known as \\"胡服骑射\\" (wearing of the Hu-nomadic people's attire, and shooting arrows from horseback), which greatly increased the combat-effectiveness of the army of Zhao. Although mounted archers represented an initial tactical advantage over Chinese armies, the Chinese learned to adapt.Graff, Conservative forces opposed change, which affected the proportional balance amongst cavalrymen, horse-drawn chariots and infantrymen in Chinese armies.Ellis, John. (2004). Cavalry: The History of Mounted Warfare, pp. 19-20. The benefits of using horses as light cavalry against chariots in warfare was understood when the Chinese confronted incursions from nomadic tribes of the steppes. Feeding horses was a significant problem; and many people were driven from their land so that the Imperial horses would have adequate pastures. Climate and fodder south of the Yangtze River were unfit for horses raised on the grasslands of the western steppes.Goodrich, The Chinese army lacked a sufficient number of good quality horses. Importation was the only remedy but the only potential suppliers were the steppe-nomads. The strategic factor considered most essential in warfare was controlled exclusively by the merchant-traders of the most likely enemies.Sinor, Denis. \\"Horse and Pasture in Inner Asian history,\\" Oriens Extremus, Vol. 19, No. 1-2 (1972), pp. 171-183. The Chinese used chariots for horse-based warfare until light cavalry forces became common during the Warring States era (402-221 BC); and speedy cavalry accounted in part for the success of the Qin dynasty (221 BCE–206 BCE).Goodrich, The Chinese warhorses were cultivated from the vast herds roaming free on the grassy plains of northeastern China and the Mongolian plateau. The hardy Central Asian horses were generally short-legged with barrel chests. Speed was not anticipated from this configuration, but strength and endurance are characteristic features.Gilbey, Walter. (1900). During the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), records tell of a Chinese expedition to Fergana (in present-day Uzbekistan) and the superior horses which were acquired.AMNH: \\"The Origin of Horses.\\" The horses were acquired for military use and for breeding. ::\\"Horses are the foundation of military power, the great resources of the state but, should this falter, the state will fall\\" ::::::  Ma Yuan (14BC - 49AD), a Han general and horse expert. During the Jin dynasty (265–420), records of thousands of \\"armored horses\\" illustrate the development of warfare in this period.Graff, The map of Asia in 800 shows Tang China in relation to its neighbors, including the Uighur Empire of Mongolia. Horses and skilled horsemen were often in short supply in agrarian China, and cavalry were a distinct minority in most Sui dynasty (581–618) and Tang Dynasty (618–907) armies.Graff, The Imperial herds numbered 325,700 horses in 794Graff, The Song (960–1279) through Ming dynasty (1368–1644) armies relied on an officially supervised tea-for-horse trading systems which evolved over centuries.Perdue, Peter. (2005). Tea and horses were so inextricably related that officials repeatedly requested that the tea laws and the horse administration be supervised by the same man. From the perspective of the Chinese court, government control of tea was the first step in the creation of a rational and effective policy aimed at improving the quality of horses in the army.\\" In the late Ming Dynasty, the marked inferiority of the Chinese horses was noted by the Jesuit missionary and ambassador Matteo Ricci (1552–1610), who observed: ::\\"[The Chinese] have countless horses in the service of the army, but these are so degenerate and lacking in martial spirit that they are put to rout even by the neighing of the Tartars steed and so they are practically useless in battle.\\" Qing New Army. =Japan= Most Japanese horses are descended from Chinese and Korean imports, and there was some cross-breeding with indigenous horses which had existed in Japan since the Stone Age.Friday, Karl F. (2004). Although records of horses in Japan are found as far back as the Jōmon period, they played little or no role in early Japanese agriculture or military conflicts until horses from the continent were introduced in the 4th century.Friday, The Kojiki and Nihon Shoki mention horses in battle.Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric and Käthe Roth. (2005). \\"Horses\\" in citing the Kojiki and Nihon shoki. Amongst the Imperial aristocracy, some were especially renowned for their horsemanship.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). ; Sadaijin . It was cavalry, not infantry, which proved to be decisive in the Jinshin War of 672–673, in Fujiwara no Hirotsugu's rebellion in 740 and in the revolt of Fujiwara no Nakamaro in 756.Friday, Karl F. (1996). Samurai fought as cavalry for many centuries,Turnbull, Stephen R. (2002). and horses were used both as draft animals and for war.Kōdansha. (1993). Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, p. 564. The increasingly elaborate decorations on harnesses and saddles of the samurai suggests the value accorded to these war horses. Yabusame archers, Edo period The samurai were particularly skilled in the art of using archery from horseback. They used methods of training such as yabusame, which originated in 530 AD and reached its peak under Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199 AD) in the Kamakura period. Japanese Equestrian Archery Association: Takeda School of Horseback Archery. The conventions of warfare in Japan switched from an emphasis on mounted bowmen to mounted spearmen during the Sengoku period (1467–1615). Amongst the samurai, Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616) was known as an excellent horseman, which forms the foundation of an anecdote about the shōgun's character. One day he and his troops had to cross a very narrow bridge over a raging river. All were wondering how he would ride over this dangerous bridge. Ieyasu dismounted, led the horse over the bridge to the other side, and then he re-mounted his steed.Sidney Institute (NSW, Australia), Tokugawa Ieaysu At Nikkō, the burial place of the horse ridden by Ieyasu Tokugawa in the Battle of Sekigahara is marked with an inscribed stone.Chamberlain, Basil Hall. (1913). In pre-Meiji Japan, horses were only considered in a context of warfare and transportation of cargo. As a general rule non-samurai and women did not ride in a saddle as this was reserved for samurai warriors, however, Tomoe Gozen was an exception to the general ruleKitagawa, Hiroshi et al. (1975). The Tale of the Heike, p. 519; McCullough, Helen Craig. (1988). The appearance of women and non-samurai on horseback in Meiji period prints represented an innovative development. Since 1958, a statue of a horse at Yasukuni Shrine has acknowledged the equine contributions in Japanese military actions; and opened, full bottles of water are often left at the statues. Other public memorials in other locations in Japan commemorate horses in Japanese warfare, e.g., the Nogi Shrine in Kyoto.Nogi jinja: image of paired horses. =Korea= This Silla horse rider pottery is among the National Treasures of Korea The Korean horse is the smallest of the East Asian breeds, but the breed is very strong with noteworthy stamina in terms of its size.Gilbey, The earliest horse warfare of Korea was recorded during the ancient Korean kingdom Gojoseon. The influence of northern nomadic peoples and Yemaek peoples on Korean warfare dates from the 3rd century BC. By roughly the 1st century BC, the ancient kingdom of Buyeo also had mounted warriors.Ebrey, 120. The cavalry of Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, were called Gaemamusa (개마무사, 鎧馬武士). King Gwanggaeto the Great often led expeditions into Baekje, Gaya confederacy, Buyeo and against Japanese pirates with his cavalry.Lee, Peter H & Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition, page 24-26. Columbia University Press, 1997. In the 12th century, Jurchen tribes began to violate the Goryeo- Jurchen borders, and eventually invaded Goryeo. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general Yun Gwan realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo-Jurchen borders (동북 9성, 東北 九城). =Mongolia= The warhorses of the Mongols were called cerigyn nojan. The wars of Genghis Khan were mounted campaigns;Blunden, Jane. (2008). Mongolia: The Bradt Travel Guide, p. 79. and Mongol horses were better cared for than the horses of their enemies.Neville, Peter. (2006). A Traveller's History of Russia, p. 14, citing James Chambers, (1979). The Devil's Horsemen. These horses were well-protected and equipped, including lamellar armour with five parts to safeguard specific parts of the horse.Li, Xiaobing. (2012). China at War, p. 288. By 1225 Genghis Khan's empire stretched from the Caspian Sea and northern China; and his horses grew to be highly prized throughout Asia. Mongolian horses were known for their hardiness, endurance and stamina. Descendants of Genghis Khan's horses remain in great number in Mongolia. \\"The Horses of Genghis Khan\\" at TrueAppaloosas.com; retrieved 2013-2-2. The limited pasture lands in eastern Europe affected the westward movement of Mongolian mounted forces.Keen, Maurice. (1999). Medieval Warfare:A History: A History, p. 197. During World War II, many Mongolian horses were sent to the Soviet Union.Hendricks, Bonnie L. (2007). International Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds, p. 287. Inner Asia Mural commemorating victory of General Zhang Yichao over the Tibetan Empire in 848. Mogao cave 156, late Chinese Tang Dynasty The empires of China had at various points in history engaged their nomadic neighbors in combat with reduced effectiveness in cavalry combat, and have a various times instituted reforms to meet a highly mobile adversary that fought principally on horseback; one such important reform as clearly recorded in Chinese historical text was King Wuling of Zhao (340BC-395BC), who advocated the principle of 胡服骑射, the \\"wearing of Hu nomadic people's clothing, and the firing of arrows from horseback\\" during the Spring and Autumn period, which greatly helped increase combat effectiveness against the cavalries of the nomadic combatants. Nomadic opponents at the borders of the various empires of China generally used the horse effectively in warfare, which only slowly developed into changes in the way horses were used.Latourette, Kenneth Scott. (1965). The Chinese: Their History and Culture, p. 144. The Chinese scholar Song Qi (宋祁, 998-1061) explained, :\\"The reason why our enemies to the north and west are able to withstand China is precisely because they have many horses and their men are adept at riding; this is their strength. China has few horses, and its men are not accustomed to riding; this is China's weakness.... The court constantly tries, with our weakness, to oppose our enemies' strength, so that we lose every battle .... Those who propose remedies for this situation merely wish to increase our armed forces in order to overwhelm the enemy. They do not realize that, without horses, we can never create an effective military force.\\"Creel, \\"The Role of the Horse in Chinese History,\\" Horses in logistical support Traditionally, the horse has been used as a pack animal, essential in providing logistical support for military forces.Creel, Gallery File:VN lancer.jpgWood relief, 13th century Vietnam.

Space Invaders Extreme 2 features new content compared to its predecessor.Rumor: Retailers leak Space Invaders Extreme 2, list features A cut-down version of the game called Space Invaders Extreme Z has been made available on DSiWare (Japan only) for 500 Points.Taito Ports Space Invaders Extreme 2 To DSiWare Siliconera Gameplay Space Invaders Extreme 2 has similar gameplay to its predecessor, such as the switching weapons, Fever Time, chaining, Bingo Fevers, and more. However, there are several changes and new systems in the game: =Modes= There are now three modes, Score Attack, Ranking, and the brand-new Time Attack. In Score Attack the goal is to get as many points as possible, while in Time Attack, the goal is to finish as fast as possible. Ranking Mode is still the same as it was in the first game where the player must reach any of the 5-x stages and defeat the final boss without using a continue and not running out of stock. A new 'Beginner' mode has been added to the Score Attack mode. This only allows the player to play through the easiest set of stages in the game with infinite lives. If you beat every level in Score Attack mode on Normal difficulty, a new difficulty, Extreme, is unlocked. Gameplay in Extreme is much more difficult with harder formations to destroy, brand-new Invader types not seen in Normal difficulty, and harder variations of bosses. Additionally, there are now branching stages for Extreme starting at Stage 4-x. =The Bingo system and Fever Time= The Fever system has been changed for SIE2. The general way to get Fever Time is still the same, hit four aliens of the same color and then four more of the same color to send over a flashing UFO, which starts a Round upon being shot. Unlike the first game, SIE2 does not discriminate alien shapes. The player only has to worry about colors. However, unlike the previous game, the 'Round' takes place in the top screen, and can be shot past the top of the bottom screen to reach the other screen. The round is won by eliminating the enemies in the top screen in under 30 seconds, which activates Fever Time. Fever Time also works differently in SIE2. White UFOs fly around in the top screen, and the normal waves of the current stage (albeit in a gold color) are on the bottom screen. During this time, you are locked into using the last shot upgrade you received for the duration of Fever Time. Shooting the UFOs destroys them, and shooting the gold aliens offers gold items. UFOs and gold items destroyed and collected respectively increase your bonus for the Fever Time. This will fill in a 'Bingo' slot. On the top screen, there is a 'Bingo' card, with a three by three pattern. Each square has an internal and external color. If you get to a Fever Time, the slot is filled in (e.g., if you hit four red then four green aliens, the red block with green inside is filled in). If the block you fill in is already filled in, it unlocks a bonus not related to the Bingo, such as the Roulette UFO or the Change to UFO bonuses. Making a line of three blocks on the 'Bingo' card unlocks a special Round, and if it is beaten, a special Fever Time occurs, known as Bingo Fever. The UFOs are colored gold as well as the stages' aliens, and a pink UFO appears which drops a large pink item worth 30,000 points. Regardless of your previous weapon, Bingo Fevers force the player to use the most powerful iteration of the Bomb powerup. Two lines can also be made at the same time, which enables Two Lines Fever, with three pink UFOs per UFO wave. The player will have a special Broad Shot that is double the normal width per shot, having six bullets per shot rather than the normal five. The last and hardest to achieve Bingo set is Full House Fever, with a giant UFO being blocked by 200pt Invaders, half of which have an unbreakable barrier. If enough damage is accumulated on the giant UFO, you will get a Jackpot, and every time you hit the UFO from that point onwards makes it drop out a pink item. The player has an all-penetrating Laser that's twice the normal width in the game during this Fever Time. Also, this Fever Time doesn't last as long if the UFO is not fully damaged within the time limit (not seen). The Shield powerup is the only Fever Time not to have a Bingo variant. =Other changes= There are several new wave patterns, backgrounds, music tracks and bosses in SIE2 as well as a commentator which you hear when the player achieves certain goals. This male voice also serves to provides words of encouragement and congratulations. However, as in a possible throwback to the last game, the first stage background pattern from Extreme 1 is visible in the background in the menu screens. The number of points that is required for different ranks has been heightened significantly - however, it is also easier to earn extra points, due to the 'Rank' stat now able to reach a x16 level. Black-colored invaders enable special effects from the previous games' Roulette, which has fewer effects this time. Shooting the following colors enables a special effect: * Black/Blue: All invaders freeze in place for a short period of time. * Black/Red: All invaders change to UFO. UFO invaders immediately drop any powerup if they are not colored white. * Black/Green: A roulette is started and the player ALWAYS has a chance to earn an extra life or none at all. There are frequent occurrences of these two colors showing up in progressively difficult stages. Additionally, if the player is on their final stock and gets a roulette, the roulette wheel changes to have every slot but one to have an extra stock. The remaining slot is a massive point bonus. A few changes are also made in Multiplayer; If you shoot a Round Feature like you would do in the single player mode, a large UFO will appear on screen. Upon hitting it, it will send the wave along with a large alien. Also, a UFO count is shown in-game, and if that count drops to zero, a flashing UFO will appear on screen randomly. Upon being hit, this will send a giant UFO over at your opponent. The AI used in the 'VS Com' mode has also been improved to include multiple difficulties. The background has also been changed. Instead of a black background, artwork for the original Space Invaders can be seen. Also, in certain waves a gold '200pt' invader (normally seen in single-player Fever Time) can be destroyed, giving out a gold item. This gives you the Broad Shot from Two-Line Fever. Interesting to point out is that the music played in Multiplayer is taken from the previous game, entitled \\"Zero Hour\\", the music from Stage 5D.

It was Renoir's second full-length film and is based on the 1880 novel by Émile Zola. It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich and the Neuilly Studios in Paris. The film's sets were designed by the art director Claude Autant-Lara. Plot A government official, Count Muffat, falls under the spell of Nana, a young actress. She becomes his mistress, living in the sumptuous apartment which he provides for her. Instead of elevating herself to Muffat's level, however, Nana drags the poor man down to hers - in the end, both lives have been utterly destroyed. Production The film stars Renoir's wife, Catherine Hessling, in an eccentric performance as the flawed heroine Nana. Jean Renoir's film is a fairly faithful adaptation of Émile Zola's classic novel. The film's extravagances include two magnificent set pieces – a horse race and an open air ball. The film never made a profit, and the commercial failure of the film robbed Renoir of the opportunity to make such an ambitious film again for several years.

The concerned citizens of Nanton had rallied together and formed a Historical Society appropriately named \\"Save One\\". Of course the original goal of the save one effort was to do just that, save one, but before anything could be done to save the elevator the Society had to gain full title to the land and buildings. Which was a big undertaking that would take three years to achieve. With so many volunteer hours from many local businesses and citizens, the Society was so successful that not only did they end up saving just one elevator, but all three remaining elevators. Many donations from members and surrounding farmers-ranchers, have been made and have helped in replacing the railway tracks next to the elevators the completion of many of the repairs and restorations that needed to be done on the elevators.

Some materials that fall into this category include inorganic crystalline and polycrystalline solids, ceramics, glasses, polymers, and composites. Solid-state ionic devices, such as solid oxide fuel cells, can be much more reliable and long-lasting, especially under harsh conditions, than comparable devices with fluid electrolytes. The field of solid-state ionics was first developed in Europe, starting with the work of Michael Faraday on solid electrolytes Ag2S and PbF2 in 1834. Fundamental contributions were later made by Walther Nernst, who derived the Nernst equation and detected ionic conduction in heterovalently doped zirconia, which he applied in his Nernst lamp. Another major step forward was the characterization of silver iodide in 1914. Around 1930, the concept of point defects was established by Yakov Frenkel, Walter Schottky and Carl Wagner, including the development of point-defect thermodynamics by Schottky and Wagner; this helped explain ionic and electronic transport in ionic crystals, ion-conducting glasses, polymer electrolytes and nanocomposites. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, solid-state ionics focused on the synthesis and characterization of novel solid electrolytes and their applications in solid state battery systems, fuel cells and sensors. The term solid state ionics was coined in 1967 by Takehiko Takahashi, but did not become widely used until the 1980s, with the emergence of the journal Solid State Ionics. The first international conference on this topic was held in 1972 in Belgirate, Italy, under the name \\"Fast Ion Transport in Solids, Solid State Batteries and Devices\\". History =Foundations = Michael Faraday in 1842 In the early 1830s, Michael Faraday laid the foundations of electrochemistry and solid- state ionics by discovering the motion of ions in liquid and solid electrolytes. Earlier, around 1800, Alessandro Volta used a liquid electrolyte in his voltaic pile, the first electrochemical battery, but failed to realize that ions are involved in the process. Meanwhile, in his work on decomposition of solutions by electric current, Faraday used not only the ideas of ion, cation, anion, electrode, anode, cathode, electrolyte and electrolysis, but even the present-day terms for them.See and other OED pages for the etymology of these terms Faraday associated electric current in an electrolyte with the motion of ions, and discovered that ions can exchange their charges with an electrode while they were transformed into elements by electrolysis. He quantified those processes by two laws of electrolysis. The first law (1832) stated that the mass of a product at the electrode, Δm, increases linearly with the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte, Δq. The second law (1833) established the proportionality between Δm and the “electrochemical equivalent” and defined the Faraday constant F as F = (Δq/Δm)(M/z), where M is the molar mass and z is the charge of the ion. In 1834, Faraday discovered ionic conductivity in heated solid electrolytes Ag2S and PbF2. In PbF2, the conductivity increase upon heating was not sudden, but spread over a hundred degrees Celsius. Such behavior, called Faraday transition, is observed in the cation conductors Na2S and Li4SiO4 and anion conductors PbF2, CaF2, SrF2, SrCl2 and LaF3. Later in 1891, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf reported on the ion transport numbers in electrochemical cells, and in the early 20th century those numbers were determined for solid electrolytes. =First theories and applications= The voltaic pile stimulated a series of improved batteries, such as the Daniell cell, fuel cell and lead acid battery. Their operation was largely understood in the late 1800s from the theories by Wilhelm Ostwald and Walther Nernst. In 1894 Ostwald explained the energy conversion in a fuel cell and stressed that its efficiency was not limited by thermodynamics. Ostwald, together with Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, and Svante Arrhenius, was a founding father of electrochemistry and chemical ionic theory, and received a Nobel prize in chemistry in 1909. His work was continued by Walther Nernst, who derived the Nernst equation and described ionic conduction in heterovalently doped zirconia, which he used in his Nernst lamp. Nernst was inspired by the dissociation theory of Arrhenius published in 1887, which relied on ions in solution. In 1889 he realized the similarity between electrochemical and chemical equilibria, and formulated his famous equation that correctly predicted the output voltage of various electrochemical cells based on liquid electrolytes from the thermodynamic properties of their components. Besides his theoretical work, in 1897 Nernst patented the first lamp that used a solid electrolyte. Contrary to the existing carbon-filament lamps, Nernst lamp could operate in air and was twice more efficient as its emission spectrum was closer to that of daylight. AEG, a lighting company in Berlin, bought the Nernst’s patent for one million German gold marks, which was a fortune at the time, and used 800 of Nernst lamps to illuminate their booth at the world’s fair Exposition Universelle (1900). =Ionic conductivity in silver halides= Temperature-dependent ionic conductivity of silver halides, original graph by Tubandt and Lorenz. Among several solid electrolytes described in the 19th and early 20th century, α-AgI, the high- temperature crystalline form of silver iodide, is widely regarded as the most important one. Its electrical conduction was characterized by Carl Tubandt and E. Lorenz in 1914. Their comparative study of AgI, AgCl and AgBr demonstrated that α-AgI, is thermally stable and highly conductive between 147 and 555 °C; the conductivity weakly increased with temperature in this range and then dropped upon melting. This behavior was fully reversible and excluded non- equilibrium effects. Tubandt and Lorenz described other materials with a similar behavior, such as α-CuI, α-CuBr, β-CuBr, and high-temperature phases of Ag2S, Ag2Se and Ag2Te. They associated the conductivity with cations in silver and cuprous halides and with ions and electrons in silver chalcogenides. =Point defects in ionic crystals= Frenkel defect in AgCl In 1926, Yakov Frenkel suggested that in an ionic crystal like AgI, in thermodynamic equilibrium, a small fraction of the cations, α, are displaced from their regular lattice sites into interstitial positions. He related α with the Gibbs energy for the formation of one mol of Frenkel pairs, ΔG, as α = exp(-ΔG/2RT), where T is temperature and R is the gas constant; for a typical value of ΔG = 100 kJ/mol, α ~ 1 at 100 °C and ~6 at 400 °C. This idea naturally explained the presence of an appreciable fraction of mobile ions in otherwise defect-free ionic crystals, and thus the ionic conductivity in them. Frenkel’s idea was expanded by Carl Wagner and Walter Schottky in their 1929 theory, which described the equilibrium thermodynamics of point defects in ionic crystals. In particular, Wagner and Schottky related the deviations from stoichiometry in those crystals with the chemical potentials of the crystal components, and explained the phenomenon of mixed electronic and ionic conduction. Wagner and Schottky considered four extreme cases of point-defect disorder in a stoichiometric binary ionic crystal of type AB: # Pairs of interstitial cations A+ and lattice vacancies (Frenkel defects) #Pairs of interstitial anions B− and lattice vacancies (anti-Frenkel defects) #Pairs of interstitial cations A+ and interstitial anions B− with no vacancies # Pairs of A and B-type lattice vacancies with no interstitials (Schottky disorder). Type-3 disorder does not occur in practice, and type 2 is observed only in rare cases when anions are smaller than cations, while both types 1 and 4 are common and show the same exp(-ΔG/2RT) temperature dependence. Later in 1933, Wagner suggested that in metal oxides an excess of metal would result in extra electrons, while a deficit of metal would produce electron holes, i.e., that atomic non-stoichiometry would result in a mixed ionic-electronic conduction. =Other types of disorder = Ionic glasses The studies of crystalline ionic conductors where excess ions were provided by point defect continued through 1950s, and the specific mechanism of conduction was established for each compound depending on its ionic structure. The emergence of glassy and polymeric electrolytes in the late 1970s provided new ionic conduction mechanisms. A relatively wide range of conductivites was attained in glasses, wherein mobile ions were dynamically decoupled from the matrix. It was found that the conductivity could be increased by doping a glass with certain salts, or by using a glass mixture. The conductivity values could be as high as 0.03 S/cm at room temperature, with activation energies as low as 20 kJ/mol. Compared to crystals, glasses have isotropic properties, continuously tunable composition and good workability; they lack the detrimental grain boundaries and can be molded into any shape, but understanding their ionic transport was complicated by the lack of long-range order. Historically, an evidence for ionic conductivity was provided back in the 1880s, when German scientists noticed that a well-calibrated thermometer made of Thuringian glass would show −0.5 °C instead of 0 °C when placed in ice shortly after immersion in boiling water, and recover only after several months. In 1883, they reduced this effect 10 times by replacing a mixture of sodium and potassium in the glass by either sodium or potassium. This finding helped Otto Schott develop the first accurate lithium-based thermometer. More systematic studies on ionic conductivity in glass appeared in 1884, but received broad attention only a century later. Several universal laws have been empirically formulated for ionic glasses and extended to other ionic conductors, such as the frequency dependence of electrical conductivity σ(ν) – σ(0) ~ νp, where the exponent p depends on the material, but not on temperature, at least below ~100 K. This behavior is a fingerprint of activated hopping conduction among nearby sites.  Polymer electrolytes In 1975, Peter V. Wright, a polymer chemist from Sheffield (UK), produced the first polymer electrolyte, which contained sodium and potassium salts in a polyethylene oxide (PEO) matrix. Later another type of polymer electrolytes, polyelectrolyte, was put forward, where ions moved through an electrically charged, rather than neutral, polymer matrix. Polymer electrolytes showed lower conductivities than glasses, but they were cheaper, much more flexible and could be easier machined and shaped into various forms. While ionic glasses are typically operated below, polymer conductors are typically heated above their glass transition temperatures. Consequently, both the electric field and mechanical deformation decay on a similar time scale in polymers, but not in glasses. Between 1983 and 2001 it was believed that the amorphous fraction is responsible for ionic conductivity, i.e., that (nearly) complete structural disorder is essential for the fast ionic transport in polymers. However, a number of crystalline polymers have been described in 2001 and later with ionic conductivity as high as 0.01 S/cm 30 °C and activation energy of only 0.24 eV. Nanostructures In the 1970s–80s, it was realized that nanosized systems may affect ionic conductivity, opening a new field of nanoionics. In 1973, it was reported that ionic conductivity of lithium iodide (LiI) crystals could be increased 50 times by adding to it a fine powder of ‘’insulating’’ material (alumina). This effect was reproduced in the 1980s in Ag- and Tl-halides doped with alumina nanoparticles. Similarly, addition of insulating nanoparticles helped increase the conductivity of ionic polymers. These unexpected results were explained by charge separation at the matrix- nanoparticle interface that provided additional conductive channels to the matrix, and the small size of the filler particles was required to increase the area of this interface. Similar charge-separation effects were observed for grain boundaries in crystalline ionic conductors. Applications By 1971, solid-state cells and batteries based on rubidium silver iodide (RbAg4I5) have been designed and tested in a wide range of temperatures and discharge currents. Despite the relatively high conductivity of RbAg4I5, they have never been commercialized due to a low overall energy content per unit weight (ca. 5 W·h/kg). On the contrary, LiI, which had a conductivity of only ca. 1 S/cm at room temperature, found a wide-scale application in batteries for artificial pacemakers. The first such device, based on undoped LiI, was implanted into a human in March 1972 in Ferrara, Italy. Later models used as electrolyte a film of LiI, which was doped with alumina nanoparticles to increase its conductivity. LiI was formed in an in situ chemical reaction between the Li anode and iodine-poly(2-vinylpyridine) cathode, and therefore was self-healed from erosion and cracks during the operation. Sodium-sulfur cells, based on ceramic β-Al2O3 electrolyte sandwiched between molten-sodium anode and molten-sulfur cathode showed high energy densities and were considered for car batteries in the 1990s, but disregarded due to the brittleness of alumina, which resulted in cracks and critical failure due to reaction between molten sodium and sulfur. Replacement of β-Al2O3 with NASICON did not save this application because it did not solve the cracking problem, and because NASICON reacted with the molten sodium. Yttria-stabilized zirconia is used as a solid electrolyte in oxygen sensors in cars, generating voltage that depends on the ratio of oxygen and exhaust gas and providing electronic feedback to the fuel injector. Such sensors are also installed at many metallurgical and glass-making factories. Similar sensors of CO2, chlorine and other gases based on solid silver halide electrolytes have been proposed in the 1980s–1990s. Since mid-1980s, a Li-based solid electrolyte is used to separate the electrochromic film (typically WO3) and ion-storing film (typically LiCoO2) in the smart glass, a window whose transparency is controlled by external voltage. Solid-state ionic conductors are essential components of lithium-ion batteries, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), supercapacitors, a novel class of electrochemical energy storage devices, and solid oxide fuel cells, devices that produces electricity from oxidizing a fuel. Nafion, a flexible fluoropolymer-copolymer discovered in the late 1960s, is widely used as a polymer electrolyte in PEMFCs.

Early life Fish originally hailed from Bedford, Indiana, but moved to Volusia County, Florida in 1881. He became the Superintendent of the Volusia County Schools district when he was 25, and went on to study at Stetson Law School and becoming a founding member of Stetson University's Sigma Nu chapter, graduating and being admitted to the Florida bar in 1902. Fish then joined a law partnership in DeLand, and from 1904 to 1910 served as a judge. Politics and diplomacy Fish was the finance director of the Democratic National Committee and Franklin Roosevelt's Florida Campaign Manager during the 1932 presidential election and a reputed friend of Senator Claude Pepper. Upon Roosevelt's victory, Fish received the ambassadorship to Egypt, being appointed on September 6, 1933, and presenting his credentials December 2, 1933; because his appointment came while the Senate was in recess, he was subsequently confirmed on January 15, 1934 and recommissioned. In 1935 Stetson University bestowed an honorary LL.D. degree on Fish. Though still residing in Cairo, Fish was appointed the first U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia on August 7, 1939, presenting his credentials on February 4, 1940. He left both assignments on February 28, 1941. That February he took a steamer down the Red Sea to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where he gave a silver-framed photograph of Roosevelt to King Ibn Saud and was treated to a banquet by Prince Faisal. Even before terminating these assignments, Fish was appointed as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal on February 11, 1941, and presented credentials on March 26, 1941. While at his new post he became ill, and died just two weeks later on July 21, 1943. The American diplomat and historian George F.

Andéramboucane) is a town and cercle in Ménaka Region, Mali. It lies at the extreme east of the country, several kilometers north of the Nigerien border. It was previously a commune in Ménaka Cercle but was promoted to the status of a cercle when Ménaka Region was implemented in 2016. Andéramboukane is a rural, isolated, and largely desert area, crisscrossed by seasonal wadis, part of an ancient dry river system of the Azawagh region (the Iullemmeden Basin). The area is just south of the rocky outcrops of the Ader Douchi hills, and north of the Sahel scrubland which begins in Niger. Most of the population of the area are nomadic Tuareg or other nomadic minorities, including the Wodaabe Fula. The sedentary population is a largely low caste Tuareg community. The town is a seasonal gathering point for the Kel Dinnik Tuareg confederation, who travel from the desert Azawagh in the rainy season and the Niger River valley in the dry season. Since the 1990s, the town has hosted a formalised version of the traditional fairs that take place at beginning of the southward transhumance cycle. This festival, named Tamadacht, has become a showcase of traditional and contemporary Tuareg and Wodaabe music, dance, sport, performance, and arts. Lawlessness The area around Andéramboukane has a reputation for lawlessness. Since the 1990s, there have been conflicts between Nigerien Fula and Malian Tuareg cattle herders in the area, and the theft of animals has been a regular occurrence.

Materials proposed for use as solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries include ceramics (e.g. oxides, sulfides, phosphates), and solid polymers. Solid-state batteries have found use in pacemakers, RFID and wearable devices. They are potentially safer, with higher energy densities, but at a much higher cost. Challenges to widespread adoption include energy and power density, durability, material costs, sensitivity and stability.  History  Between 1831 and 1834, Michael Faraday discovered the solid electrolytes silver sulfide and lead(II) fluoride, which laid the foundation for solid-state ionics. In the late 1950s, several electrochemical systems employed solid electrolytes. They used a silver ion, but had low energy density and cell voltages, and high internal resistance. A new class of solid-state electrolyte, developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1990s, was used to make thin film lithium-ion batteries. In 2011, Bolloré launched BlueCar with a 30kWh lithium metal polymer (LMP) battery with a polymeric electrolyte created by dissolving a lithium salt in a co-polymer (polyoxyethylene). In 2013, researchers at University of Colorado Boulder announced the development of a solid-state lithium battery, with a solid composite cathode based upon an iron-sulfur chemistry that promised higher energy capacity. In 2014, researchers at Sakti3 announced a solid-state lithium-ion battery, claiming higher energy density for lower cost. Toyota announced its solid-state battery development efforts and holds the most related patents. In 2015, Sakti3 was acquired by Dyson. In 2017, John Goodenough, the co-inventor of Li-ion batteries, unveiled a solid-state battery, using a glass electrolyte and an alkali-metal anode consisting of lithium, sodium or potassium. Toyota announced the deepening of its decades- long partnership with Panasonic, including a collaboration on solid-state batteries. Other car makers developing solid-state battery technologies include BMW, Honda, Hyundai Motor Company and Nissan. Household appliance maker Dyson announced and then abandoned a plan to build an electric car. Fisker Inc. claimed that its solid-state battery technology would be ready for \\"automotive-grade production\\" in 2023. Spark plug maker NGK is developing ceramic-based solid state batteries. In 2018, Solid Power, spun off from CU Boulder research, received $20 million in funding for a small manufacturing line to produce all-solid-state, rechargeable lithium-metal batteries, with a predicted 10 megawatt hours of capacity per year. Volkswagen announced a $100 million investment in QuantumScape, a solid-state battery startup that spun out of Stanford. Chinese company Qing Tao started a production line of solid- state batteries.  Materials  Solid-state electrolytes candidate materials include ceramics such as lithium orthosilicate, glass and sulfides.The cathodes are lithium based. Variants include LiCoO2, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, LiMn2O4, and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2. The anodes vary more and are affected by the type of electrolyte. Examples include In, GexSi1−x, SnO–B2O3, SnS –P2S5, Li2FeS2, FeS, NiP2, and Li2SiS3. One promising cathode material is Li-S, which (as part of a solid lithium anode/Li2S cell) has a theoretical specific capacity of 1670 mAh g−1, \\"ten times larger than the effective value of LiCoO2\\". Sulfur makes an unsuitable cathode in liquid electrolyte applications because it is soluble in most liquid electrolytes, dramatically decreasing the battery's lifetime. Sulfur is studied in solid state applications. Recently, a ceramic textile was developed that showed promise in a LI-S solid state battery. This textile facilitated ion transmission while also handling sulfur loading, although it did not reach the projected energy density. The result \\"with a 500-μm-thick electrolyte support and 63% utilization of electrolyte area\\" was \\"71 Wh/kg.\\" while the projected energy density was 500 Wh/kg. Li-O2 also have high theoretical capacity. The main issue with these devices is that the anode must be sealed from ambient atmosphere, while the cathode must be in contact with it. A Li/LiFePO4 battery shows promise as a solid state application for electric vehicles. A 2010 study presented this material as a safe alternative to rechargeable batteries for EV's that \\"surpass the USABC- DOE targets\\".  Uses  Solid-state batteries have found potential use in pacemakers, RFID and wearable devices. = Electric vehicles = Hybrid and plug-in electric cars use a variety of battery technologies, including Li-ion, Nickel–metal hydride (NiMH), Lead–acid, and electric double-layer capacitor (or ultracapacitor), led by Li-ion.  Challenges  = Cost = Solid-state batteries are traditionally expensive to make and employs manufacturing processes thought to be difficult to scale, requiring expensive vacuum deposition equipment. It was estimated in 2012 that, based on then-current technology, a 20 Ah solid-state battery cell would cost US$100,000, and a high-range electric car would require 800 to 1,000 of such cells. Cost has impeded the adoption of solid-state batteries in other areas, such as smartphones. = Temperature and pressure sensitivity = Low temperature operations may be challenging. Solid-state batteries were once noted for poor performance. Solid-state batteries with ceramic electrolytes require high pressure to maintain contact with the electrodes. Solid-state batteries with ceramic separators may break from mechanical stress. = Dendrites = Lithium metal dendrite from the anode piercing through the separator and growing towards the cathode. Solid lithium (Li) metal anodes in solid-state batteries are replacement candidates in lithium-ion batteries for higher energy densities, safety, and faster recharging times. Such anodes tend to suffer from the formation and the growth of Li dendrites. Dendrites penetrate the separator between the anode and the cathode causing short circuits. This causes overheating, which may result in fire and maybe even explosion from thermal runaway. Li dendrites reduce coulombic efficiency. Dendrites commonly form during electrodeposition during charge and discharge. Li ions in combine with electrons at the anode surface as the battery charges - forming a layer of lithium metal. Ideally, the lithium deposition occurs evenly on the anode. However, if the growth is uneven, dendrites form. Stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was found to be the most effective strategy for inhibiting dendrite growth and increasing cycling performance. solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) may prevent dendrite growth, although this remains speculative. A 2018 study identified nanoporous ceramic separators that block Li dendrite growth up to critical current densities.  Advantages  Solid-state battery technology is believed to deliver higher energy density (2.5x), by enabling lithium metal anodes. They may avoid the use of dangerous or toxic materials found in commercial batteries, such as organic electrolytes. Because most liquid electrolytes are flammable and solid electrolytes are nonflammable, solid-state batteries are believed to have lower risk of catching fire. Fewer safety systems are needed, further increasing energy density. Recent studies show that heat generation inside is only ~20-30% of conventional batteries with liquid electrolyte under thermal runaway. Solid-state battery technology is believed to allow for faster charging. Higher voltage and longer cycle life is also possible.

Lambert was born at Champigny-sur-Veude, France. He received his musical education as an altar boy at the Chapel of Gaston d'Orléans, a brother of king Louis XIII. He studied also with Pierre de Nyert in Paris. Since 1636, he was known as a singing teacher. In 1641, he married singer Gabrielle Dupuis who died suddenly a year later. Their daughter Madeleine (1643-1720) married Jean-Baptiste Lully in 1662. After his marriage, Lambert's career became closely linked to his sister-in-law and famous singer Hilaire Dupuis (1625-1709). In 1651, he appears as a ballet dancer at the court of Louis XIV. Beginning in 1656, his reputation as a composer was established and his compositions were regularly printed by Ballard. They consist mainly of airs on poems of Benserade and Quinault. He was the most prolific composer of airs in the second half of the 17th century. In 1661, he succeeded Jean de Cambefort as a maître de musique de la chambre du roi and kept this position until his death. In that time, Lully was the 'surintendant de la musique de la chambre du roi' (from 1661) and Master of Music of the royal family (from 1662). Lambert's role as a singing master ('maître de chant') and composer of dramatic airs contributed to the creation of French tragédie lyrique. As a singing master, he enjoyed a reputation attested by many testimonies of his time (including singers Anne de La Barre, Pierre Perrin, and La Cerf of Viéville). Titon du Tillet mentions concerts given at his house in Puteaux, during which Lambert accompanied himself on the theorbo. He also collaborated with Lully in the creation of several ballets (e.g. Ballet des amours déguisés). He died in Paris, France.

It was a twin-engined, twin boom biplane. One was built as a landplane for France, while three more similar aircraft were built as Seaplanes for the British Royal Naval Air Service. Both versions were unsuccessful and saw no service. Development and design In summer 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War, the French government ordered a single example of a twin-engined bomber from the Samuel White shipyard in Cowes, Isle of Wight. The result, designed by Howard T. Wright, chief designer of White's aircraft department (which operated as Wight Aircraft after its location), was a very large twin boom biplane with five-bay folding wings, powered by two 200 hp (149 kW) Salmson water-cooled radial engines fitted in the front of the fuselage booms. The crew of three was housed in a small central nacelle between the twin booms and situated on the lower wing.Goodall 1998, p.73. The Twin Landplane was completed in July 1915, and was found to have adequate flying characteristics during testing at Eastchurch during August. In September 1915, however, a French test pilot crashed the Twin Landplane during acceptance testing, and the contract for the aircraft was cancelled. At the same time, the British Admiralty required a long range aircraft capable of carrying the 18 inch torpedoes thought necessary to sink large warships. An order was therefore placed with Samuel White's for a large torpedo carrying aircraft. The resulting Twin Seaplane was based closely on the Twin Landplane, with the central nacelle removed and cockpits for the crew of two fitted in the two fuselages behind the wings. The first prototype, which was delayed by the unavailability of the engines, was completed in 1916, but proved during testing to be unable to carry both a torpedo and a full fuel load. Two modified aircraft followed, with longer float struts and new tail surfaces. These two aircraft also proved underpowered, and the type was abandoned, with the last Twin Seaplane written off in 1917.Mason 1994, pp.25-26.Goodall 1998, pp.14-15.

The image shows a cytosine single ring base and a methyl group added on to the 5 carbon. In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at a cytosine that is followed by a guanine. In mammals, DNA demethylation causes replacement of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in a DNA sequence by cytosine (C) (see figure of 5mC and C). DNA demethylation can occur by an active process at the site of a 5mC in a DNA sequence or, in replicating cells, by preventing addition of methyl groups to DNA so that the replicated DNA will largely have cytosine in the DNA sequence (5mC will be diluted out). Methylated cytosine is frequently present in the linear DNA sequence where a cytosine is followed by a guanine in a 5' → 3' direction (a CpG site). In mammals, DNA methyltransferases (which add methyl groups to DNA bases) exhibit a strong sequence preference for cytosines at (CpG sites). There appear to be more than 20 million CpG dinucleotides in the human genome (see genomic distribution). In mammals, on average, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated, though the level of methylation varies with different tissues. Methylated cytosines often occur in groups or CpG islands within the promoter regions of genes, where such methylation may reduce or silence gene expression (see gene expression). Methylated cytosines in the gene body, however, are positively correlated with expression. Almost 100% DNA demethylation occurs by a combination of passive dilution and active enzymatic removal during the reprogramming that occurs in early embryogenesis and in gametogenesis. Another large demethylation, of about 3% of all genes, can occur by active demethylation in neurons during formation of a strong memory. After surgery, demethylations are found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at sites annotated to immune system genes. Demethylations also occur during the formation of cancers. During global DNA hypomethylation of tumor genomes, there is a minor to moderate reduction of the number of methylated cytosines (5mC) amounting to a loss of about 5% to 20% on average of the 5mC bases.  Embryonic development  Methylation levels during mouse early embryonic development. =Early embryonic development= The mouse sperm genome is 80–90% methylated at its CpG sites in DNA, amounting to about 20 million methylated sites. After fertilization, the paternal chromosome is almost completely demethylated in six hours by an active process, before DNA replication (blue line in Figure). Demethylation of the maternal genome occurs by a different process. In the mature oocyte, about 40% of its CpG sites in DNA are methylated. While somatic cells of mammals have three main DNA methyltransferases (which add methyl groups to cytosines at CpG sites), DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, in the pre-implantation embryo up to the blastocyst stage (see Figure), the only methyltransferase present is an isoform of DNMT1 designated DNMT1o. DNMT1o has an alternative oocyte-specific promoter and first exon (exon 1o) located 5' of the somatic and spermatocyte promoters. As reviewed by Howell et al., DNMT1o is sequestered in the cytoplasm of mature oocytes and in 2-cell and 4-cell embryos, but at the 8-cell stage is only present in the nucleus. At the 16 cell stage (the morula) DNMT1o is again found only in the cytoplasm. It appears that demethylation of the maternal chromosomes largely takes place by blockage of the methylating enzyme DNMT1o from entering the nucleus except briefly at the 8 cell stage. The maternal-origin DNA thus undergoes passive demethylation by dilution of the methylated maternal DNA during replication (red line in Figure). The morula (at the 16 cell stage), has only a small amount of DNA methylation (black line in Figure). DNMT3b begins to be expressed in the blastocyst. Methylation begins to increase at 3.5 days after fertilization in the blastocyst, and a large wave of methylation then occurs on days 4.5 to 5.5 in the epiblast, going from 12% to 62% methylation, and reaching maximum level after implantation in the uterus. By day seven after fertilization, the newly formed primordial germ cells (PGC) in the implanted embryo segregate from the remaining somatic cells. At this point the PGCs have about the same level of methylation as the somatic cells. =Gametogenesis= The newly formed primordial germ cells (PGC) in the implanted embryo devolve from the somatic cells. At this point the PGCs have high levels of methylation. These cells migrate from the epiblast toward the gonadal ridge. As reviewed by Messerschmidt et al., the majority of PGCs are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, while they migrate toward the hindgut during embryo days 7.5 to 8.5. Then demethylation of the PGCs takes place in two waves. At day 9.5 the primordial germ cells begin to rapidly replicate going from about 200 PGCs at embryo day 9.5 to about 10,000 PGCs at day 12.5. During days 9.5 to 12.5 DNMT3a and DNMT3b are repressed and DNMT1 is present in the nucleus at a high level. But DNMT1 is unable to methylate cytosines during days 9.5 to 12.5 because the UHRF1 gene (also known as NP95) is repressed and UHRF1 is an essential protein needed to recruit DNMT1 to replication foci where maintenance DNA methylation takes place. This is a passive, dilution form of demethylation. In addition, from embryo day 9.5 to 13.5 there is an active form of demethylation. As indicated below in \\"Molecular stages of active reprogramming,\\" two enzymes are central to active demethylation. These are a ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) and thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG). One particular TET enzyme, TET1, and TDG are present at high levels from embryo day 9.5 to 13.5, and are employed in active demethylation during gametogenesis. PGC genomes display the lowest levels of DNA methylation of any cells in the entire life cycle of the mouse at embryonic day 13.5. Learning and Memory Brain regions involved in memory formation Learning and memory have levels of permanence, differing from other mental processes such as thought, language, and consciousness, which are temporary in nature. Learning and memory can be either accumulated slowly (multiplication tables) or rapidly (touching a hot stove), but once attained, can be recalled into conscious use for a long time. Rats subjected to one instance of contextual fear conditioning create an especially strong long-term memory. At 24 hours after training, 9.17% of the genes in the genomes of rat hippocampus neurons were found to be differentially methylated. This included more than 2,000 differentially methylated genes at 24 hours after training, with over 500 genes being demethylated. Similar results to that in the rat hippocampus were also obtained in mice with contextual fear conditioning. The hippocampus region of the brain is where contextual fear memories are first stored (see figure of the brain, this section), but this storage is transient and does not remain in the hippocampus. In rats contextual fear conditioning is abolished when the hippocampus is subjected to hippocampectomy just one day after conditioning, but rats retain a considerable amount of contextual fear when hippocampectomy is delayed by four weeks. In mice, examined at 4 weeks after conditioning, the hippocampus methylations and demethylations were reversed (the hippocampus is needed to form memories but memories are not stored there) while substantial differential CpG methylation and demethylation occurred in cortical neurons during memory maintenance. There were 1,223 differentially methylated genes in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice four weeks after contextual fear conditioning. Thus, while there were many methylations in the hippocampus shortly after memory was formed, all these hippocampus methylations were demethylated as soon as four weeks later. Demethylation in Cancer The human genome contains about 28 million CpG sites, and roughly 60% of the CpG sites are methylated at the 5 position of the cytosine. During formation of a cancer there is an average reduction of the number of methylated cytosines of about 5% to 20%, or about 840,00 to 3.4 million demethylations of CpG sites. DNMT1 methylates CpGs on hemi-methylated DNA during DNA replication. Thus, when a DNA strand has a methylated CpG, and the newly replicated strand during semi-conservative replication lacks a methyl group on the complementary CpG, DNMT1 is normally recruited to the hemimethylated site and adds a methyl group to cytosine in the newly synthesized CpG. However, recruitment of DNMT1 to hemimethylated CpG sites during DNA replication depends on the UHRF1 protein. If UHRF1 does not bind to a hemimethylated CpG site, then DNMT1 is not recruited and cannot methylate the newly synthesized CpG site. The arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 regulates DNA methylation by methylating the arginine at position 2 of histone 3 (H3R2me2a). (See Protein methylation#Arginine.) In the presence of H3R2me2a UHRF1 can not bind to a hemimethylated CpG site, and then DNMT1 is not recruited to the site, and the site remains hemimethylated. Upon further rounds of replication the methylated CpG is passively diluted out. PRMT6 is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancer cells. The overexpression of PRMT6 may be a source of DNA demethylation in cancer. Molecular stages of active reprogramming Three molecular stages are required for actively, enzymatically reprogramming the DNA methylome. Stage 1: Recruitment. The enzymes needed for reprogramming are recruited to genome sites that require demethylation or methylation. Stage 2: Implementation. The initial enzymatic reactions take place. In the case of methylation, this is a short step that results in the methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. Stage 3: Base excision DNA repair. The intermediate products of demethylation are catalysed by specific enzymes of the base excision DNA repair pathway that finally restore cystosine in the DNA sequence. =Stage 2 of active demethylation= Demethylation of 5-methylcytosine. Demethylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in neuron DNA. As reviewed in 2018, in brain neurons, 5mC is oxidized by a TET dioxygenase to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). In successive steps a TET enzyme further hydroxylates 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) recognizes the intermediate bases 5fC and 5caC and cleaves the glycosidic bond resulting in an apyrimidinic site (AP site). In an alternative oxidative deamination pathway, 5hmC can be oxidatively deaminated by activity-induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex (AID/APOBEC) to form 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU). 5mC can also be converted to thymine (Thy). 5hmU can be cleaved by TDG, single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1), Nei-Like DNA glycosylase 1 (NEIL1), or methyl-CpG binding protein 4 (MBD4). AP sites and T:G mismatches are then repaired by base excision repair (BER) enzymes to yield cytosine (Cyt). Demethylation of 5-methylcytosine to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) very often initially involves oxidation of 5mC by ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenases (TET enzymes). (see Figure in this section). The molecular steps of this initial demethylation are shown in detail in TET enzymes. In successive steps (see Figure) TET enzymes further hydroxylate 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) recognizes the intermediate bases 5fC and 5caC and excises the glycosidic bond resulting in an apyrimidinic site (AP site). This is followed by base excision repair (stage 3). In an alternative oxidative deamination pathway, 5hmC can be oxidatively deaminated by APOBEC (AID/APOBEC) deaminases to form 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU). Also, 5mC can be converted to thymine (Thy). 5hmU can be cleaved by TDG, MBD4, NEIL1 or SMUG1. AP sites and T:G mismatches are then repaired by base excision repair (BER) enzymes to yield cytosine (Cyt). The TET family of dioxygenases are employed in the most frequent type of demethylation reactions. TET family TET dioxygenase isoforms include at least two isoforms of TET1, one of TET2 and three isoforms of TET3. The full-length canonical TET1 isoform appears virtually restricted to early embryos, embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells (PGCs). The dominant TET1 isoform in most somatic tissues, at least in the mouse, arises from alternative promoter usage which gives rise to a short transcript and a truncated protein designated TET1s. The isoforms of TET3 are the full length form TET3FL, a short form splice variant TET3s, and a form that occurs in oocytes and neurons designated TET3o. TET3o is created by alternative promoter use and contains an additional first N-terminal exon coding for 11 amino acids. TET3o only occurs in oocytes and neurons and is not expressed in embryonic stem cells or in any other cell type or adult mouse tissue tested. Whereas TET1 expression can barely be detected in oocytes and zygotes, and TET2 is only moderately expressed, the TET3 variant TET3o shows extremely high levels of expression in oocytes and zygotes, but is nearly absent at the 2-cell stage. It is possible that TET3o, high in neurons, oocytes and zygotes at the one cell stage, is the major TET enzyme utilized when very large scale rapid demethylations occur in these cells. =Stage 1 of demethylation - recruitment of TET to DNA= The TET enzymes do not specifically bind to 5-methylcytosine except when recruited. Without recruitment or targeting, TET1 predominantly binds to high CG promoters and CpG islands (CGIs) genome-wide by its CXXC domain that can recognize un-methylated CGIs. TET2 does not have an affinity for 5-methylcytosine in DNA. The CXXC domain of the full-length TET3, which is the predominant form expressed in neurons, binds most strongly to CpGs where the C was converted to 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). However, it also binds to un-methylated CpGs. Initiation of DNA demethylation at a CpG site. In adult somatic cells DNA methylation typically occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides (CpG sites), forming 5-methylcytosine-pG, (5mCpG). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may attack guanine at the dinucleotide site, forming 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide site. The base excision repair enzyme OGG1 targets 8-OHdG and binds to the lesion without immediate excision. OGG1, present at a 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits TET1 and TET1 oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to the 8-OHdG. This initiates demethylation of 5mC as shown in the previous figure. For a TET enzyme to initiate demethylation it must first be recruited to a methylated CpG site in DNA. Two of the proteins shown to recruit a TET enzyme to a methylated cytosine in DNA are OGG1 (see figure Initiation of DNA demethylation at a CpG site) and EGR1. OGG1 Oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) catalyses the first step in base excision repair of the oxidatively damaged base 8-OHdG. OGG1 finds 8-OHdG by sliding along the linear DNA at 1,000 base pairs of DNA in 0.1 seconds. OGG1 very rapidly finds 8-OHdG. OGG1 proteins bind to oxidatively damaged DNA with a half maximum time of about 6 seconds. When OGG1 finds 8-OHdG it changes conformation and complexes with 8-OHdG in its binding pocket. OGG1 does not immediately act to remove the 8-OHdG. Half maximum removal of 8-OHdG takes about 30 minutes in HeLa cells in vitro, or about 11 minutes in the livers of irradiated mice. DNA oxidation by reactive oxygen species preferentially occurs at a guanine in a methylated CpG site, because of a lowered ionization potential of guanine bases adjacent to 5-methylcytosine. TET1 binds (is recruited to) the OGG1 bound to 8-OHdG (see figure). This likely allows TET1 to demethylate an adjacent methylated cytosine. When human mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) were treated with H2O2, 8-OHdG increased in DNA by 3.5-fold and this caused about 80% demethylation of the 5-methylcytosines in the MCF-10A genome. EGR1 The gene early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) is an immediate early gene (IEG). EGR1 can rapidly be induced by neuronal activity. The defining characteristic of IEGs is the rapid and transient up-regulation—within minutes—of their mRNA levels independent of protein synthesis. In adulthood, EGR1 is expressed widely throughout the brain, maintaining baseline expression levels in several key areas of the brain including the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and amygdala. This expression is linked to control of cognition, emotional response, social behavior and sensitivity to reward. EGR1 binds to DNA at sites with the motifs 5′-GCGTGGGCG-3′ and 5'-GCGGGGGCGG-3′ and these motifs occur primarily in promoter regions of genes. The short isoform TET1s is expressed in the brain. EGR1 and TET1s form a complex mediated by the C-terminal regions of both proteins, independently of association with DNA. EGR1 recruits TET1s to genomic regions flanking EGR1 binding sites. In the presence of EGR1, TET1s is capable of locus-specific demethylation and activation of the expression of downstream genes regulated by EGR1. DNA demethylation intermediate 5hmC As indicated in the Figure above, captioned \\"Demethylation of 5-methylcytosine,\\" the first step in active demethylation is a TET oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The demethylation process, in some tissues and at some genome locations, may stop at that point. As reviewed by Uribe-Lewis et al., in addition to being an intermediate in active DNA demethylation, 5hmC is often a stable DNA modification. Within the genome, 5hmC is located at transcriptionally active genes, regulatory elements and chromatin associated complexes. In particular, 5hmC is dynamically changed and positively correlated with active gene transcription during cell lineage specification, and high levels of 5hmC are found in embryonic stem cells and in the central nervous system. In humans, defective 5-hydroxymethylating activity is associated with a phenotype of lymphoproliferation, immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. =Stage 3 base excision repair= DNA polymerase β (Pol β) adding a single cytosine opposite the pre-existing guanine in the complementary strand and then DNA ligase to seal the cut strand. In long patch repair, DNA synthesis is thought to be mediated by polymerase δ and polymerase ε performing displacing synthesis to form a flap. Pol β can also perform long-patch displacing synthesis. Long- patch synthesis typically inserts 2–10 new nucleotides. Then flap endonuclease removes the flap, and this is followed by DNA ligase to seal the strand. The third stage of DNA demethylation is removal of the intermediate products of demethylation generated by a TET enzyme by base excision repair. As indicated above in Stage 2, after 5mC is first oxidized by a TET to form 5hmC, further oxidation of 5hmC by TET yields 5fC and oxidation of 5fC by TET yields 5caC. Both 5fC and 5caC are recognized by a DNA glycosylase, TDG, a base excision repair enzyme, as an abnormal base. As shown in the Figure in this section, TDG removes the abnormal base (e.g. 5fC) while leaving the sugar-phosphate backbone intact, creating an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, commonly referred to as an AP site. In this Figure, the 8-OHdG is left in the DNA, since it may have been present when OGG1 attracted TET1 to the CpG site with a methylated cytosine. After an AP site is formed, AP endonuclease creates a nick in the phosphodiester backbone of the AP site that was formed when the TDG DNA glycosylase removed the 5fC or 5caC. The human AP endonuclease incises DNA 5′ to the AP site by a hydrolytic mechanism, leaving a 3′-hydroxyl and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (5' dRP) residue. This is followed by either short patch or long patch repair. In short patch repair, 5′ dRP lyase trims the 5′ dRP end to form a phosphorylated 5′ end. This is followed by DNA polymerase β (pol β) adding a single cytosine to pair with the pre-existing guanine in the complementary strand and then DNA ligase to seal the cut strand. In long patch repair, DNA synthesis is thought to be mediated by polymerase δ and polymerase ε performing displacement synthesis to form a flap. Pol β can also perform long-patch displacement synthesis. Long-patch synthesis typically inserts 2–10 new nucleotides. Then flap endonuclease removes the flap, and this is followed by DNA ligase to seal the strand. At this point there has been a complete replacement of the 5-methylcytosine by cytosine (demethylation) in the DNA sequence. Demethylation after exercise Physical exercise has well established beneficial effects on learning and memory (see Neurobiological effects of physical exercise). BDNF is a particularly important regulator of learning and memory. As reviewed by Fernandes et al., in rats, exercise enhances the hippocampus expression of the gene Bdnf, which has an essential role in memory formation. Enhanced expression of Bdnf occurs through demethylation of its CpG island promoter at exon IV and this demethylation depends on steps illustrated in the two figures. Demethylation after exposure to traffic related air pollution In a panel of healthy adults, negative associations were found between total DNA methylation and exposure to traffic related air pollution. DNA methylation levels were associated both with recent and chronic exposure to Black Carbon as well as benzene. Peripheral sensory neuron regeneration After injury, neurons in the adult peripheral nervous system can switch from a dormant state with little axonal growth to robust axon regeneration. DNA demethylation in mature mammalian neurons removes barriers to axonal regeneration. This demethylation, in regenerating mouse peripheral neurons, depends upon TET3 to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA. 5hmC was altered in a large set of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), including well-known RAGs such as Atf3, Bdnf, and Smad1, that regulate the axon growth potential of neurons.

Patient blood management represents an international initiative in best practice for transfusion medicine that is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO). Establishing a patient blood management strategy requires leadership and support from national and regional government policymakers and managers, healthcare professionals, and patients. Patients are an essential part of planning, implementing and evaluating PBM programs. Examples of how to implement PBM are available from Australia, the UK, and the USA.  Three pillars of patient blood management  # Detect and treat anemia # Prevent or minimize blood loss # Enhance patient's physiological reserve to tolerate anemia Necessity Evidence indicates that a great number of the patients who are being transfused today may not be seeing many tangible benefits from it, as the transfused blood fails to achieve its primary goals – prevention of ischemia and improving the clinical outcomes. The challenge lies in identifying those patients who are at risk of complications of severe anemia (ischemia) and transfusing them, without exposing other patients to unwarranted risks of inappropriate transfusions. Better transfusion practice should not be viewed as an option, but a necessity to ensure clinicians are doing good and not doing harm to their patients. Cost issues Another significant reason to embrace the concept of patient blood management is cost. Allogeneic blood transfusion is extremely expensive. For example, some studies reported increased costs of $300–$1,000 per unit of allogeneic blood transfused. The more blood that is transfused directly impacts hospital expenditures, and of course, it behoves administrators to search for ways to reduce this cost. This increasing cost of transfusions is the reason many hospital administrators are endeavoring to establish blood management programs. Patient outcomes Perhaps the single most important reason for implementing patient blood management is need to improve patient outcomes. Published in 2017, a retrospective observational study in four major adult tertiary-care hospitals concluded that implementation of a unique, jurisdiction-wide PBM program was associated with improved patient outcomes, reduced blood product utilization, and product-related cost savings. Better outcomes are achieved with the reduction or avoidance of exposure to allogeneic blood. Numerous clinical studies have shown that allogeneic blood transfusions are associated with increased mortality and an increased level of serious complications, while potentially exposing the patient to viral, bacterial, or parasitic agents. Also, current medical literature shows that in most circumstances a restrictive threshold is as safe as a more liberal red cell transfusion threshold and in certain circumstances, for example gastrointestinal bleeding due to liver disease, a more liberal red cell transfusion strategy may be harmful. Methods The cornerstone of patient blood management is a multidisciplinary approach, involving family physicians, nurses, anesthetists, surgeons, Transfusion Practitioners, hematologists, and hematology and blood transfusion laboratory staff. Part of PBM is avoiding unnecessary treatments and procedures, and some of the PBM recommendations from around the world have been incorporated in to the \\"Choosing Wisely\\" campaigns that exist in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA. = Surgical PBM = Patient blood management in the perioperative setting can be achieved by means of a variety of techniques and strategies. First, ensuring that the patient enters the operating room with a sufficient hematocrit level is essential. Preoperative anemia has been documented to range from 5% in female geriatric hip fracture patients to over 75% in colon cancer patients. Patients who are anemic prior to surgery obviously receive more transfusions. Erythropoietin and iron therapy can be considered in cases of anemia. Accordingly, patients should be screened for anemia at least 30 days prior to an elective surgical procedure. Although either oral or parenteral iron could be given, increasingly clinicians are giving parenteral iron to ensure that the haemoglobin is increased the maximal amount before the elective surgery is undertaken. During surgery, techniques are utilized to reduce or eliminate exposure to allogeneic blood. For example, electrocautery, which is a technique utilized for surgical dissection, removal of soft tissue and sealing blood vessels, can be applied to a variety of procedures. During surgical procedures that are expected to have significant blood loss, blood that is lost during surgery can be collected, filtered, washed and given back to the patient. This procedure is known as \\"Intraoperative Blood Salvage.\\" Pharmacologic agents, for example tranexamic acid, can also be utilized to minimize blood loss. Another technique, acute normovolemic hemodilution\\" involves the collection of a selected calculated volume of autologous blood in collection bags prior to the start of surgery with the simultaneous replacement of an equal volume of asanguinous fluid. Since the patient's blood is now diluted, blood lost during the surgical procedure, i.e. by hemorrhage, contains smaller amounts of red blood cells. The collected autologous blood product, which contains red blood cells, platelets and coagulation factors, is reinfused at the end of the surgery. When all of these therapies are combined, blood loss is greatly reduced which correspondingly reduces or averts the potential for allogeneic blood transfusion. Additional details on this question can be found in the journal, Transfusion. = Benefits of Information Technology in PBM = Information technology can be useful in implementing a patient blood management policy, this includes: * Daily e-mails alerting physicians of transfusions that have occurred outside of the local guidelines * Computerized physician order entry systems that automatically create an alert when the transfusion order is inconsistent with the reason selected for transfusion and the laboratory hemoglobin level. * Improved management of blood components, leading to decreased wastage  References   Further reading    Blood Hematology Transfusion medicine Surgery ","title":"Blood management"},{"id":"21227825","text":"The Variety Playhouse (originally known as the Euclid Theatre) is a music venue in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is located on Euclid Avenue and features a variety of music acts including rock, indie, electronic, funk, country, folk, bluegrass, jazz, blues and world music as well as other live shows. History The building was erected in 1940 and has been dedicated to different uses over the years, under different names. =1940–1962= View from behind the building showing the \\"Euclid Theatre Entrance\\" sign The theater was built as a cinema by Lucas and Jenkins Theatres, a company which operated other Georgia theaters at the time including the Fox in Atlanta. The Euclid was among three theaters built by L&J; in Atlanta in 1940, another was the Gordon Theatre in the West End (now used as a church). The Euclid boasted a \\"staggered seating plan so no seat is directly behind another\\" and a neon marquee with \\"Euclid\\" in block letters. It opened at 2:15 P.M. Friday, October 4, 1940 and the first film exhibited was My Favorite Wife. It continued as a first-run neighborhood cinema for the surrounding Candler Park and Inman Park neighborhoods for the next two decades. By 1962, the theater was running a mix of first-run and revival films. The last scheduled show seen in Atlanta Constitution listings consisted of the films Zotz! and Friendly Persuasion on July 30 and 31. Newspaper listings after this indicate the theater was \\"Closed for Repairs\\" for a few days, but it never reopened. The exact circumstances of the closing are not known. A painted sign on the southeast corner of the building (above the stage door) which says \\"Euclid Theatre Entrance\\" was still visible as of 2009. See photo. =1962–1983= The building was not used as a cinema or theater for some two decades after the Euclid closed. At one point it was a warehouse for plumbing supplies (including some barrels of ammonia that required cleanup) and it was eventually slated for demolition. Atlanta mayor Maynard Jackson intervened resulting in the sale of the building to the Little Five Points Partnership, which was redeveloping the neighborhood in the early 1980s. =1984–1988= In 1982, Atlanta actor and art cinema operator George Ellis (known to many in the area as TV host Bestoink Dooley) was looking for another, larger theater location to exhibit films. His Film Forum locations in Ansley and Buckhead had been popular among Atlanta film buffs for years. After finding that the Little Five Points Partnership needed a tenant for the Euclid, Ellis recruited his friend Glenn Sirkis (a former Hayes Microcomputer Products executive) as an investor in the project. They started a renovation of the then 42-year-old building which would eventually cost $250,000. The goal was to reopen as \\"The Masterpiece Cinema\\", a duplex which would dedicate one screen to foreign-language films and the other to English- language films. In June 1983 (in the middle of the renovation) George Ellis died suddenly at age 64. At the memorial service for Ellis, Glenn Sirkis announced that the renovation of the Euclid would continue, but at its planned opening in February 1984 it would be named the Ellis Cinema as a memorial. That date came and went as Sirkis and his wife Jill Kirn spent almost two years completing the renovation. The duplex idea was dropped. The exterior elements of the theater were retained, but the interior was \\"totally redesigned\\" with 310 seats, and a series of small mezzanines to accommodate tables and chairs along the outside walls. A small bar provided additional seating in the rear. A screen was built, one of the largest in Atlanta at that time. The theater was designed to cater to an upscale audience with concessions such as amaretto chocolate truffles and a list of vintage wines. The total capacity at this time was 463. A private opening ceremony was held on Thursday, October 4, 1984, exactly 44 years to the day from the original opening. The Ellis opened to the public on October 5, and the first film exhibited was The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. A notable success of this period was the film Mass Appeal, which had not seen widespread U.S. distribution. A thank you note from Jack Lemmon for this was on display in the lobby. Other big successes of the Ellis era included Working Girls, Desert Hearts, Brazil and Personal Services. In addition to the first-run art films, the Ellis experimented with repertory cinema in February 1986 (starting with 1960 film Breathless) after the Rhodes Theater closed in December 1985. The Ellis was highly regarded amongst the Atlanta cinemas of the time. It was named \\"The Nicest Theater in Atlanta\\" by Frank Thompson in Atlanta Magazine and WAGA (TV) gave it a Best of Atlanta award for \\"Best Theater Concessions.\\" Because the Ellis was a single screen, Sirkis and Kirn had trouble convincing movie distributors to rent films to them (as opposed to multi-screen operators in Atlanta such as George Lefont and the major chains). \\"It's the only business that as a buyer you have to convince your supplier to sell to you,\\" said Jill Kirn in a news article when the Ellis closed in 1988. \\"We just aren't big enough fish,\\" she added. The Ellis closed on Monday, August 8, 1988 with no advance notice. In the next year a group called The George Ellis Film Society was formed with the goal of reopening the theater, but that effort was ultimately unsuccessful. (The Society proceeded to have film festivals and other events in Ellis' honor for a few years). =1989–1990= In 1989 Paul Blane, a 62-year-old talent manager and producer from Valdosta, Georgia, moved to Atlanta to dedicate the theater to live performances, particularly featuring classic motion picture stars. He had produced and directed a revue called \\"Great Stars of the Silver Screen\\" (starring Dorothy Lamour, Yvonne De Carlo, Jane Russell and others) which toured the country from 1981 to 1987, and he intended to produce similar shows in a permanent venue. He renamed the theater The Variety Playhouse and reportedly spent $100,000 renovating the building. This included building a wide by deep stage and installing some 500 \\"very plush\\" new seats. The first show was \\"La Cage Follies\\" beginning on June 23, 1989 and which featured celebrity impersonators. Other shows during this era included Decatur's Beacon Dance Company and the National Black Arts Festival. Musical performers were also featured during this era, such as The Blue Nile, The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Muzsikás, Odetta and Leon Redbone. This incarnation of the theater only lasted about one year. =1990–2015= The Variety Playhouse continues its operations today—here, Atlanta-based Magnapop is shown playing a benefit concert for local record store Criminal Records in 2011 Blane's goal of live performances was not totally successful, and the theater had relied more and more on music acts to fill the schedule. Ultimately, on Monday, August 20, 1990 the management of the theater was assumed by Steven Harris of Windstorm Productions, a 30-year-old Atlanta-area concert promoter. He told the Atlanta Constitution that he planned to make the Variety into \\"a place where you can see a top-rated concert but in a very intimate setting.\\" The theater was briefly closed for some renovations, and reopened on September 7, 1990 with The Count Basie Orchestra as the first show, followed by Tom Rush the next day. =2015–Present= In October 2015, Variety Playhouse was purchased by Agon, the owner of Georgia Theatre in Athens, GA. In Summer 2016, venue operations were shut down for a full-scale renovation. During this time, many improvements were made to the room, including a lowered front pit area, new downstairs bathrooms, new fixed seating on the main level, larger and improved bar areas, and a completely rebuilt balcony. The venue reopened on September 28, 2016 with a show by ambient musician Tycho. Architecture The building is a World War II era movie theater with some art deco or art moderne elements that has been converted for use as a music venue. It is of brick construction and sits on with a parking area behind it. Like most cinemas of the era, it has a sloping floor in the main seating area with a balcony above. The area in front of the stage is lowered and open for dancing and standing-room for general admission shows. (Chairs are sometimes set up here for certain shows). The main seating area has theater-style seats, with an aisle on either side. Outside the two aisles are a series of tiered mezzanines that allow for tables and chairs. The bars in the lobby and on the balcony serve a variety of domestic and imported beers, liquor, wine and typical theater snacks.

A member of the Nasrid dynasty, he ruled for a brief period between June or July 1360 and April 1362. A second cousin and brother- in-law of both Muhammad V and Ismail II, he led a coup that deposed the former and enthroned the latter in August 1359. He increasingly held the power of government during Ismail's rule, and in June or July 1360 he had the new Sultan killed and took the throne to himself. Muslim chronicles portrayed him negatively, describing him as a tyrannical ruler with coarse manners. In October 1360, he allied himself with Peter IV of Aragon against Peter I of Castile in the War of the Two Peters, but had to face Castile alone when Aragon agreed to a separate peace in May 1361. Castile allied itself with Muhammad V who returned from exile in August. The war against this coalition began with partial successes for Muhammad VI, but from February 1362 onwards Peter I and Muhammad V won a string of major victories. On 13 April Muhammad VI fled Granada, allowing his rival to retake the throne. The desperate Muhammad VI then unexpectedly surrendered himself to Peter I in Seville. However, the Castilian king—still outraged at his previous alliance with Aragon—personally killed him with a lance on 27 April and sent his severed head to Granada.  Geopolitical background  Granada and the surrounding kingdoms in 1360 The Emirate of Granada was the last remaining Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, founded by Muhammad I in the 1230s. Through a combination of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, the emirate succeeded in maintaining its independence, despite being located between two larger neighbours: the Christian Crown of Castile to the north and the Muslim Marinid Sultanate in Morocco. Granada intermittently entered into alliance or went to war with both of these powers, or encouraged them to fight one another, in order to avoid being dominated by either. From time to time, the sultans of Granada swore fealty and paid tribute to the kings of Castile, an important source of income for Castile. From Castile's point of view, Granada was a royal vassal, while Muslim sources never described the relationship as such.  Origin  Note: Partial family tree. Previous sultans are indicated with . Muhammad ibn Ismail was born on 18 March 1333, likely in Granada, and a member of the ruling Nasrid dynasty. He was the grandson of Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Faraj, the brother of Sultan Ismail I (), and therefore he was related to the Ismail I's sons and grandsons who took the throne before his reign. In 1327, Muhammad ibn Faraj claimed the throne in Andarax, but he was defeated by Muhammad IV () in the ensuing civil war. Muhammad VI was a second cousin to his immediate predecessors, Muhammad V (1354-1359 and 1362-1391) and Ismail II (1359–1360). He was further linked to the royal lineage by his marriage to a daughter of Yusuf I () during Yusuf's reign. The name of the princess he married was unknown, but she was a full-blooded sister of Ismail II and a half-sister of Muhammad V, who was born of a different mother. The marriage took place some time before Yusuf's death in 1354, and they had at least one daughter, whose name is unknown. She married Muhammad ibn al-Mawl, a member of a prominent family originally from Cordoba, and this marriage produced Muhammad's grandchildren: the future sultan Yusuf IV ibn al-Mawl (1432) and a daughter called Maryam. Muhammad was nicknamed el Bermejo (\\"The Red One\\")—apparently referring to his reddish hair and beard, originally by the Christians, but the name is also attested in Muslim sources. Before his accession, he was titled al-rais (), as per Nasrid customs for a member of the royal family.  Rise to power  Ismail I and deposed Muhammad V in the Alhambra complex (one of its palaces pictured). alt=Map of the southern Spain, with territories of Granada marked in green During the first reign of Muhammad V, el Bermejo was involved in a conspiracy that eventually deposed the Sultan in favour of Ismail II. The other key participant of this conspiracy was Maryam, Ismail's ambitious mother, who had control of a substantial amount of wealth after the death of Yusuf I. She frequently visited her daughter who was married to el Bermejo, and during these meetings they planned the conspiracy. With Maryam's financial backing, el Bermejo led about 100 men to carry out a coup on 23 August 1359, a date predicted as auspicious by an astrologer. Under cover of the night during the holy month of Ramadan, they scaled the walls of the Alhambra—the fortified palace compound of the Nasrids—taking advantage of a gap that was left unrepaired, and overwhelmed the guards. They killed Muhammad V's chief minister, the hajib Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, in front of his family, demolished his house, and took his rich possessions. Muhammad V happened to be outside the Alhambra, and fled to the eastern city of Guadix after failing to retake the palace compound. The conspirators found Ismail, who was barely twenty years old, in his assigned palace and declared him the Sultan. The historian Ibn al-Khatib—a minister of Muhammad V—depicted the new Sultan as a weak ruler with poor personal character. Soon, el Bermejo grew in influence and became the real power behind the throne. Muhammad V left for exile in North Africa after unsuccessfully trying to extend his control beyond Guadix and to secure help from his ally Peter I of Castile. El Bermejo's power grew so much that Ismail began to oppose him. Before the Sultan could act, el Bermejo started a violent coup which resulted in his accession, either on 24 June 1360 (8 Shaban 761) or on the night of 13 July (27 Shaban), less than a year after Ismail's accession. El Bermejo's men surrounded the sultan, who barricaded himself in a tower overlooking the capital. Ismail was forced to surrender and offered to live in seclusion, but el Bermejo took him, barefooted and bareheaded, to a dungeon for criminals (), where he was executed. His head was cut off and thrown to the people. Next, el Bermejo found Ismail's brother Qays, who was still a child, and executed him as well. Both their bodies were dumped in public covered only with rags, before recovered and buried the next day. Ismail's ministers were then executed as well. According to historian Francisco Vidal Castro, el Bermejo's actions were motivated by fear that either royal would be used in a future court intrigue against him, as Ismail had been to dethrone Muhammad V. Thus el Bermejo took the throne as Muhammad VI.  Rule  At his accession he adopted two laqabs (regnal honorifics), al-Ghalib bi 'llah (\\"Victor by the Grace of God\\") and al-Mutawakkil ala 'llah (\\"He who relies on God\\"), an unusual practice given his lack of major achievements. Muslim chroniclers described Muhammad VI as a coarse man in dress and manners as well as lacking in oratory skills. He reportedly hunted with his dogs, appeared in public bareheaded and with rolled up sleeves, and he had a tic that moved his head right and left uncontrollably. According to Ibn al-Khatib, he had an hashish addition. On being informed by his sahib al-shurta (chief of police) that his people had abandoned all their vices, Muhammad enquired, \\"And the hashish, what about that?\\" and was told none had been found. He answered, \\"I would that were so! But go to the house of So-and-so and So-and-so ...\\" and then provided the names and addresses of all those whose gatherings he had previously attended. The police subsequently found hashish in those places, and the police chief told Ibn al-Khatib that the Sultan became \\"my instructor in my own profession\\". Muhammad VI ruled tyrannically and persecuted those whom he suspected of sympathising with Muhammad V, which, combined with his poor manners, caused many at court to flee Granada to Morocco or to the Christian Crown of Castile. He made a deal with the Marinid Sultan of Morocco, Abu Salim Ibrahim, in which Abu Salim was to keep the dethroned Muhammad V from returning to the Iberian Peninsula, while Muhammad VI arrested rebellious Moroccan princes who took asylum in Granada. Muhammad VI abandoned his predecessors' policy of alliance with Castile; instead he stopped the customary tribute to Castile and on 9 October 1360 concluded an alliance with its enemy in the War of the Two Peters, the Christian Crown of Aragon. The six-year treaty was ratified in 16 February 1361 and included terms providing the freedom of emigrations for Aragon's Muslim subjects (), similar to those secured by Ismail I in 1321, but soon this provision was rendered ineffective due to various unofficial obstacles implemented by Peter IV. The friendly correspondence between Muhammad VI and Peter IV of Aragon are conserved today as part of the Aragonese archives. Castile defeated Aragon in Nájera in 1360, but the prospect of fighting on two fronts worried Peter I, who then agreed to peace with Peter IV in May 1361. Peter IV wrote to Muhammad VI that he made peace under the direction of Pope Innocent VI, and did not wish to lose the friendship of the Sultan. The Castilian king then shifted his attention against Muhammad VI. He pressured Abu Salim to allow Muhammad V to return to Granada by threatening to attack Marinid possessions on the Iberian Peninsula. The Marinid Sultan complied; Muhammad V sailed to Gibraltar in August 1361. A rival court was established at the Marinid outpost of Ronda, with the financial backing of Peter I. When the Marinid and Castilian navy launched joint attacks on Granada's coast, Muhammad VI requested Aragon to send ships against the Marinids while he dealt with the Castilians. Muhammad V and Peter I then launched an offensive with the intention of deposing Muhammad VI. In 1361, their troops defeated those of Muhammad VI in Belillos. They advanced towards the Vega of Granada, and appeared to have won several skirmishes in Pinos Puente, but despite the presence of Muhammad V, the Granadan royal army did not defect as they had hoped. In 15 January 1362, Muhammad VI won a major victory against a Castilian incursion near Guadix, in which he took 2,000 prisoners, including various noblemen. In a gesture of goodwill, he returned the most important of them, Diego García de Padilla, the Master of the Order of Calatrava and the brother of the royal mistress María, along with other captured knights and gifts to Castile, but this failed to appease Peter. Peter and Muhammad V joined their forces for an offensive in February 1362, taking Iznájar and Coria, but Muhammad V was antagonized by Peter's ambition to keep the conquered territories for Castile; from March onwards they led their campaigns independently. Peter took numerous fortresses, including Cesna, Sagra (later retaken by Granada's forces), Benamejí, El Burgo, Ardales, Cañete, Turón, and Cuevas del Becerro. Meanwhile, Muhammad V took Málaga, the second most important city of the emirate after Granada, along with many nearby castles, giving him control of the entire western region of the emirate. These campaigns turned the tide of the war against Muhammad VI.  Downfall  Before his death, Muhammad VI sought asylum with Peter I of Castile in Seville. Pictured: Peter's palace in Seville. The advance of Muhammad V, along with the discontent in the general population about the civil war that included the loss of Granadan territories to Castile, caused Muhammad VI to consider his position to be no longer tenable. He fled Granada on 13 April 1362 (17 Jumada al-Thani 763), accompanied by his entourage, including the chief of the Volunteers of the Faith, Idris ibn Uthman ibn al- Ula, taking most of the royal treasury. Muhammad V entered the Alhambra three days later and was recognised as Sultan. Muhammad VI unexpectedly threw himself at the mercy of Peter I at Seville. Muhammad VI offered to rule Granada as a vassal of Peter and to serve him as his knight. Should Peter choose to remain in Muhammad V's side, Muhammad VI asked to be exiled overseas. Initially, Peter did not commit to an answer, but he welcomed Muhammad VI and allowed him and his followers to stay in the city's Jewish quarter near Peter's palace, as royal guests. Later, however, the Castilian king acted against his guests: he arrested them after a feast that he organized, imprisoned the entire retinue in Seville's shipyard, and seized their riches. Two days later Muhammad VI was slain at Tablada, a castle near Seville on 25 or 27 April. Dressed in scarlet, he was led on a donkey to a field, and then tied to a stake. Peter I personally struck him with a lance, saying, \\"Take that for causing me to get a bad deal from the king of Aragon!\\" to which Muhammad VI replied, in Arabic, \\"What a little deed of chivalry\\". Peter I had blamed Muhammad VI's alliance with Aragon in the previous war against Castile for forcing him into an unfavourable peace agreement with Peter IV, in which he had to return various castles he had taken. The Castilian chronicler Pero López de Ayala wrote that Muhammad VI's treasury was the main reason for the murder, while Ibn al-Khatib wrote that Peter also desired to demonstrate his support for Muhammad V. The execution caused an outrage at the Castilian court, where many considered it an atrocious act of betrayal, and Peter justified it as a punishment for Muhammad VI's treason against Muhammad V, for killing Ismail II, and for entering Seville without obtaining a proper safe conduct—without this official guarantee, Peter argued that there was no betrayal. Arabic sources, especially the pro-Muhammad V official chronicles, support Peter's arguments. Along with Muhammad, 36 members of his entourage were killed, while the rest—totalling about 300—were imprisoned and later poisoned, including Idris. Peter sent the blood stained heads of Muhammad VI and his men to Muhammad V in Granada. For a time before they were buried, the Sultan hanged them near the section of the wall Muhammad VI had scaled to enter the Alhambra in the 1359 coup.

He was born in the town of Gorizia (then part of Austro- Hungarian Empire, now in Italy), where his father, the renowned medievalist Franc Kos, taught at the state high school. His mother was a Friulian from Gorizia and Gradisca. His younger brother Anton Gojmir Kos later became a prominent painter. He studied history at the University of Vienna, specializing in the social history of the middle ages. He was an expert on medieval settlement patterns in the Slovene Lands. He also wrote about the social history of medieval towns and issues related to early Slovenian history, including the Slavic principality of Carantania and the Freising manuscripts. In 1928, he started teaching at the University of Ljubljana, where he replaced Ljudmil Hauptmann as the head of the chair for Slovene history. In this position, he influenced almost all Slovenian historians of the post–World War II period; most of them graduated under his direct supervision, including Fran Zwitter and Bogo Grafenauer. Between 1941 and 1945, Kos served as the chancellor of the University of Ljubljana. During the difficult period of Italian and Nazi German annexation of Slovenia, Kos maintained an underground connection with the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People.

He was the 11th sultan of the Nasrid dynasty and the first son of his predecessor, Muhammad V (). When Yusuf was about three years old, his father was dethroned and the family went into exile in Fez, the capital of the Marinid Sultanate of Morocco. His father regained the throne in 1362 and the young Yusuf was given command of the Volunteers of the Faith, a corps of North African soldiers available to fight for the emirate. He became sultan after his father's death in 1391. Yusuf's government was initially dominated by his minister, Khalid, until Khalid was suspected of conspiring against the sultan and executed. Yusuf then took control of his government and appointed the poet Ibn Zamrak, his father's vizier (whom he had imprisoned), as his vizier in July 1392. Yusuf continued his father's peace treaty with Granada's neighbour Castile and signed a treaty with another Christian neighbour, John I of Aragon (), in August 1392. He died on 5 October 1392, after less than two years on the throne. A medieval Christian writer said that he was killed by a poisoned tunic given to him by the Marinid Sultan Abu al- Abbas Ahmad. Yusuf's death by poisoning is considered plausible by modern historians, but the report's veracity is doubted and may be exaggerated; no other sources corroborate the account. He was succeeded by his son Muhammad VII () and by another son, Yusuf III (). Birth and family exile  Yusuf was the first son of Muhammad V of Granada (1354–1359 and 1362–1391), and the only one born during the first of the sultan's two reigns. Although his date of birth is unknown, historian Francisco Vidal Castro estimated that he was born 757 AH or 1356 CE (a few years after his father's accession). Yusuf was about three years old when his father was dethroned on 23 August 1359; a group of men under Muhammad el Bermejo (later Muhammad VI) scaled the walls of the Alhambra that night and enthroned the sultan's half-brother, Ismail II. Yusuf was walking with his father in the Generalife gardens () just outside the Alhambra complex; this allowed the sultan to escape to Guadix in the eastern part of the emirate before going into exile across the Mediterranean Sea to Fez, the capital of Morocco's Marinid Sultanate. Yusuf was left in Granada, but around 25 November the new sultan allowed him and his mother to join the dethroned sultan in Fez. Muhammad V returned to al-Andalus on August 1361, creating a rival court in the Marinid Andalusian outpost of Ronda and beginning a civil war against Muhammad VI, who had dethroned Ismail II a year before. Muhammad V, supported by Peter of Castile, gained the upper hand; Muhammad VI fled the Alhambra and sought asylum with Peter on 13 March 1362. Muhammad V entered the abandoned royal palace and retook the throne; Muhammad VI was murdered by Peter on 25 April, and his head was sent to Muhammad V.  Return to al-Andalus  Coin of Muhammad V, Yusuf's father and one of Granada's longest-reigning Nasrid rulers Yusuf was still in Fez during his father's second accession, and the recently-enthroned Marinid Sultan Abu Zayyan Muhammad attempted to use him as a bargaining chip so Muhammad V would return Ronda to him. The Marinids yielded; Yusuf was allowed to return to Granada with his father's vizier, Ibn al-Khatib (who had also been in exile in Morocco), although Ronda remained under Granadan control. Yusuf's party arrived in Granada, the capital city, on 14 June 1362. His brothers, Abu Nasr Sa'd, Nasr (both probably born between 1362 and 1369) and Abu Abdullah Muhammad, were born afterwards. Yusuf was circumcised in 764 AH (approximately October 1362 to October 1363); this has helped historians determine his birth year, because boys were customarily circumcised at age seven. Muhammad removed Yahya ibn Umar, (chief) of the Volunteers of the Faith, from his post on 26 June 1363. The Volunteers were North African soldiers fighting for Granada, and their chief had always been a dissident prince related to the Berber Marinid dynasty; however, the sultan appointed the young Yusuf chief and Sa'd a commander. Yusuf also received a tax-free estate by his father. Muhammad V presided over one of the dynasty's longest reigns. Around the time that Yusuf reached adulthood, he was detained and summoned to court on the suspicion of rebelling against his father; he was acquitted, however, after an investigation. In 1390, when his father and John I of Castile () signed a treaty that extended peace between their kingdoms, Yusuf and John's son Henry added their signatures. Yusuf was about 35 years old when his father died in January 1391.  Rule  alt=Colored map of the Iberian Peninsula and Western North Africa Yusuf II took the throne on 15 January 1391 (10 Safar 793 AH), the day of his father's death, and adopted the (regnal honorific) of al- Mustaghni bi-llah (\\"He who is satisfied with God\\"). He sent a letter that day to Alonso Yáñez de Fajardo, the Castilian of Murcia, confirming the continuation of the truce which Muhammad V had signed with John I in 1390. Although bilateral treaties typically expired on the death of either signatory, the 1390 treaty remained in effect because both successorsYusuf and Henry III ()had also signed it. Yusuf maintained peace with Aragon, whose King John I had had good relations with Muhammad V. In March 1391, Yusuf sent the Aragonese king a letter notifying John of his father's death and his enthronement; the king replied with the customary condolences, expressing surprise at the sultan's delay in sending the letter. During the first year of his rule, Yusuf imprisoned the poet Ibn Zamrak (his father's vizier) in an Almerían dungeon. His reign was dominated by Khalid, his father's , who became his first minister (, \\"the officer of the his government\\"). Khalid imprisoned the sultan's three brothers; Yusuf did not hear about them again, and they died in captivity. Yusuf received a report suspecting Khalid of a conspiracy with Yahya ibn al-Saigh, the Jewish royal physician, to poison him. The sultan ordered them both executed; Khalid was bound and hacked to death with a sword in his presence, and Yahya was imprisoned and beheaded (or poisoned). Yusuf then took control of his government. A few months before his death, he faced another conspiracy led by his son Muhammad (the future Muhammad VII, ). Their conflict was resolved peacefully with the help of the Marinid sultan Abu al- Abbas Ahmad (), and Muhammad acknowledged his father's authority. In July 1292, Yusuf restored Ibn Zamrak as vizier. He signed a five-year peace treaty with Aragon on 14 August which was similar to previous treaties. The treaty seemed to favour Aragon's Muslim subjects (); two weeks later, John I allowed them to appear in public without a distinctive, previously-mandatory badge. On 29 August, John wrote a letter authorising the Muslims of Zaragoza to send a representative to the Nasrid court. The letter was never sent, however, probably because of the king's concern that it would provide a pretext for Granada to intervene in his internal affairs.  Family  The sultan's mother and spouses are unknown. Yusuf's first son was Yusuf III, and Muhammad VII was born soon afterwards; Abu al-Hasan Ali and Abu al-Abbas Ahmad followed. He also had a daughter, Umm al-Fath, wife of the future Muhammad IX. Historian Bárbara Boloix Gallardo writes that Yusuf sired another sultan, Ismail III of Granada; according to Vidal Castro, however, Ismail's genealogy is unclear. Not all his children were full siblings; Muhammad VII was a half-brother of Yusuf III and Umm al-Fath (full siblings, indicating that Yusuf II had more than one spouse). According to Juan de Mata Carriazo's 16th-century History of the Royal House of Granada, \\"Muhammad Guadix\\" was the eleventh sultan of Granada and died in 1392. He married Khadija, the daughter of Sultan Abu al- Abbas Ahmad II () of the Hafsid Ifriqiya; the marriage produced a son, Yusuf, who would also be sultan. Because Muhammad's death year coincides with Yusuf II's (the eleventh sultan), Boloix Gallardo writes that the Christian source misidentified Yusuf II as \\"Muhammad Guadix\\" (throwing light on the identity of one of his spouses and the mother of his son, Yusuf III).  Death  Yusuf died on 5 October 1392 (16 Dhu al-Qa'da 794 AH), aged about 36. The later Castilian Chronicle of John II alleges that he was killed by a poisoned tunic () which was among gifts sent by the Marinid Sultan Abu al-Abbas. The allegation was based on a letter by Fernán Sánchez, a Christian who lived in the emirate, during the reign of Yusuf III (). Sánchez wrote that he \\"saw with [his] own eyes\\" in Granada that the sultan felt unwell immediately after putting on the tunic and \\"died within thirty days, with his flesh coming off in pieces\\". No other sources corroborate the story and, since Sánchez wrote many similar accounts of assassinations with poisoned clothing, historian L. P. Harvey says that \\"one is reluctant to accept the report as true\\". Another historian, Francisco Vidal Castro, writes that despite the \\"fantastic\\" (and possibly altered) detail, assassination by poisoning is plausible. According to Vidal Castro, the Marinid Sultanate is known to have interfered in Granada's affairs; the sultan's son and successor, Muhammad VII, may have conspired with the Marinids or other courtiers to poison his father and seize the throne.

He was the son of Yusuf II (reigned 1391–1392) and grandson of Muhammad V (reigned 1354–1359 and 1362–1391). He came to the throne upon the death of his father. In 1394, he defeated an invasion by the Order of Alcántara. This nearly escalated to a wider war, but Muhammad VII and Henry III of Castile were able to restore peace. In 1404–1405, Muhammad VII concluded a treaty of friendship with Martin I of Aragon and engaged Charles III of Navarre in talks, thwarting Henry III's attempt to enlist those two monarchs as allies against Granada. In 1406, he and Henry III renewed their truce, but the it was overshadowed by Muslim raids—possibly not authorized by Muhammad VII—on Castilian territories. Henry III was now intent on war against Granada, but on 25December 1406 he died. Henry's 1-year-old son John II became king with his uncle Ferdinand and mother Catherine as regents. Ferdinand marched against Granada's western territories in September 1407 and took Zahara de la Sierra. Meanwhile, Muhammad VII conducted raids and sieges on his northeastern frontiers. In April 1408 Muhammad VII and Ferdinand agreed to a seven-month truce, but on 13May Muhammad VII died. His older brother succeeded him as Yusuf III and extended the truce until April 1410, after which hostilities resumed between Granada and Castile.  Background  A map of the Emirate of Granada, indicating relevant towns and cities Granada and the surrounding kingdoms Muhammad VII was the son of Yusuf II, who was briefly the Sultan of Granada between 1391–1392, and through his father the grandson of the previous sultan, Muhammad V (reigned 1354–1359 and 1362–1391). He had an older brother, Yusuf (the future Sultan Yusuf III), who was imprisoned in Salobreña at the time of Muhammad VII's accession, as a result of involvement in a conspiracy. There is a scarcity of Muslim historical sources on events during Muhammad VII's reign. Most available information comes from Christian sources and therefore relates to his interactions with Christian kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula.  Rule  = Accession = Muhammad VII came to the throne after the death of his father Yusuf II on 3October 1392 (16Dhu al-Qidah 794 AH). On his accession, he appointed Muhammad al-Hammami as his vizier or chief minister. He also freed Ibn Zamrak, Muhammad V's vizier and a famous poet, who had been imprisoned by Yusuf II. Muhammad VII appointed Ibn Zamrak as the royal katib, or secretary, but he was assassinated in the summer of 1393 and replaced by Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Asim. At the beginning of his rule, he pledged peace with his Christian neighbours: Henry III of Castile and John I of Aragon. = Crusade of 1394 = In 1394, Martín Yáñez de la Barbuda (or Martín Yáñez \\"de Barbudo\\" in some sources), the master of the military Order of Alcántara and a vassal of the king of Castile, organized a crusade against Granada. Despite attempts by Henry III and some Castilian nobles to stop him, Martín proceeded and his forces were enlarged by the people of Córdoba who supported the crusade. Martín and his forces entered Granadan territory on 26April 1394 and marched towards its capital. Muhammad VII sent emissaries to Henry III complaining about this violation of their truce, and Henry III replied that he desired peace and that the crusade was being carried out without his permission. Muhammad VII then mobilized his army and easily defeated Martín's forces. Among the survivors of the Castilian force, 1,200 were captured and 1,500 escaped to Alcalá la Real. Muhammad VII lost 500 foot soldiers. Martín was killed in the fighting and as a sign of displeasure Henry III nominated a member of the rival Order of Calatrava to be the new master of Alcántara. After the failed crusade, tensions were high and there were fears that there would be an all out war between Granada and the Christian kingdoms. Henry III went to the south, and Martín I of Aragón strengthened the defenses of Valencia, both in anticipation of an invasion. Muhammad VII prepared for war, but he too desired peace and in November asked for the truce to be extended. No country wished to escalate the conflict, so an outright war was averted. = Renewal of conflict = Despite the mutual desire for peace between Muhammad VII and Henry III, conflict continued along the border thanks to rogue forces on both sides. In May 1397, a group of Franciscan friars entered Granada to try to convert the people to Christianity. Muhammad VII forbade such activities, and when they persisted, he had them whipped. When they continued to preach, Muhammad VII ordered them executed and had their bodies dragged through the streets. In addition to this proselytisation incident, raids and skirmishes were increasingly common on the frontiers. Both authorities found it difficult to prevent unauthorized raids, and once raids had been carried out it proved difficult to restore the peace without losing face. In one raid, some Granadans went as far as Cartagena on the Murcian coast. An even larger raid took place in 1405. On the eastern front, Muslim attacks against Vera and Lorca were repulsed, but the invaders captured Ayamonte, a Castilian castle on Granada's western border. Henry III sent an emissary, Gutierre Diaz, to the Granadan court to protest. = Diplomatic maneuvering = Meanwhile, Granada, Aragon, Castile and Navarre (a small Christian kingdom in the north of the peninsula) were engaged in diplomatic communications. In 1404 Granada and Aragon conducted talks in Barcelona. At the same time, Henry III proposed a meeting at Logroño with Martín I of Aragon and Charles III of Navarre to build an anti-Granadan coalition. However, Charles III of Navarre decided to help Granada instead. His kingdom was small, like Granada, and he was worried about the growth of Castilian power. Navarre traditionally had a good relationship with its Muslim minorities, which may have influenced Charles' diplomatic posture. Charles III wrote to \\"my brother\\" Muhammad VII telling him of the upcoming Logroño summit against Granada and promising to keep him informed of the outcome. He also sent three ships loaded with wheat, as well as 300 siege machines to help Granada against a potential invasion. Granada-Navarre communications were impeded by their geographical separation—Navarre was in the north of the peninsula while Granada was in the south, and Castilian territories lay between them. A Navarrese ambassador, travelling to Granada via Castile disguised as a merchant, was intercepted by Alfonso Fernández of Aguilar in Alcala de Real. This put an end to Granada- Navarre communications and caused Henry III to cancel the Logroño meeting. Meanwhile, Martin I of Aragon, focused on his problems in Sicily and Sardinia, was also uninterested in a war against Granada. Instead, Muhammad VII and Martin I agreed to a treaty of friendship on 4May 1405. The treaty allowed commerce and prisoner exchanges between the two states. In addition, Muhammad VII would supply Aragon with 400–500 knights and pay their cost of between 2,840 and 3,540 doblas per month. In return, Aragon provided Granada with 4 or 5 galleys crewed by 30 crossbowmen and 220 seamen each, whose costs were also paid by Granada at 900 doblas per galley per month. These forces were to be used by Granada in the event of a war, other than a war against Castile, which was considered Aragon's friend. This treaty was similar to the 1376 treaty between Aragon and Granada. Finally, Granada and Castile concluded a two-year truce in Madrid on 6October 1406 after a long negotiation. Commerce was to be reopened, and frontier judges were appointed to resolve border conflicts. Each side agreed to not to allow their territories to be used to attack the other, and not to give asylum to rebels or corrupt officials attempting to flee the other's jurisdiction. = War against Castile = As the truce was concluded, some Muslim forces conducted large-scale attacks in the area around Jaén, including raids on Quesada and Baeza. Castilian troops under Pedro Manrique engaged the Muslims at the inconclusive Battle of Collejares. Given the lack of Muslim sources, it is difficult to know the motivation behind these attacks and whether Muhammad VII instructed or authorized them. Historian L. P. Harvey opined that due to both sides' inability to control all of their forces, the raids were likely conducted by rogue elements. However, with heavy Castilian losses, the truce was no longer tenable and Henry III prepared for a war against Granada. Henry III blamed Muhammad VII for the breakdown of the truce and summoned his Cortes to Toledo in December 1406. While negotiating the Cortes' support for war, Henry III became ill and died on 25December. He was succeeded by his 1-year-old son John II. Henry's brother Ferdinand, the future king of Aragon, who had been representing Henry III during his illness, took up the regency jointly with Henry's widow, Catherine of Lancaster. The Cortes went ahead, and approved funding of 45,000,000 maravedíes for the campaign. The balance of power in the upcoming war was against Granada. Castile's power had been growing, and it enjoyed demographic superiority over the much smaller Granada. In addition, Granada, thanks to Muhammad V's policy of independence and of severing ties with North African Muslim states, could not hope for major aid from the Muslims across the sea. Technological developments in artillery as a siege weapon also weighed against Granada, which was expected to be mostly on the defensive in a war against Castile. Muhammad VII struck first, in late August, besieging Jaén on the north-eastern frontier and plundering nearby Bedmar. A Castilian reinforcement forced him to break the siege. In February 1408, he besieged the castle of Alcaudete, between Jaén and Alcalá la Real. His forces fired cannons against the castle and attempted to scale the walls, nearly succeeding in taking it. After four days and after losing 2,500 men he abandoned the siege. Meanwhile, on 7September 1407 Ferdinand marched against Ronda, in Granada's western territories. While Ronda was too strongly defended to be directly assaulted, he attacked the smaller castles surrounding it. Zahara de la Sierra was the first target, and Ferdinand laid siege on 26September. In earlier times, Zahara had been very defensible, but Ferdinand's three cannons made short work of the defenses, knocking down towers and making breaches in the wall. With no relief force expected, the castle surrendered on 30September. Another castle, Ortejícar, fell on 12October. Ferdinand had also been besieging Setenil since 5October, which held out despite heavy bombardment. With food dwindling, troops deserting and winter approaching, Ferdinand abandoned the siege on 25October and returned to Seville. Frontier skirmishes and pillaging continued in the following weeks. Muhammad VII, outnumbered and unlikely to receive external help, requested a truce in April 1408. Ferdinand himself was under pressure from his Cortes because of Muhammad VII's attacks against Castilian towns on the frontier. A truce was agreed, to last from 15April to 15November 1408. Death Muhammad VII died on 13May 1408 and was replaced by his older brother, Yusuf III. According to a story, which Harvey states \\"has every appearance of a fiction\\", just before his death Muhammad ordered the execution of Yusuf. Yusuf asked the executioners for a chance to play a last game of chess. According to this story, he managed the make the game last so long that before it finished Muhammad VII died and Yusuf's supporters rescued him from prison and put him on the throne. Muhammad VII's death invalidated the truce, but Yusuf III negotiated an extension to last until April 1409, later extended to August 1409 and then April 1410. After this truce expired, hostilities commenced again between Castile and Granada. Evaluation of rule Muhammad VII abandoned the policy of pursuing peace championed by his grandfather Muhammad V. He did not shy away from war and led multiple raids himself. However, the period of his rule marked the increasing dominance of Castile vis-a-vis Granada. Granada could no longer rely on organized support from North African Muslims, even though a small number of religiously-motivated fighters did cross the strait. In contrast, Castile grew stronger and its manpower started to recover after the end of the Black Death. Castile's increased use of artillery as an offensive weapon, which was itself increasing in effectiveness, gave it an advantage over Granada, which largely fought a defensive war. Muhammad VII's rule also saw the start of a border conflict between frontiersmen from each side, which the central authorities found difficult to control. The conflict often took the form of raids for little benefit except heroism; these were the subject of the famous Castilian border ballads (romances fronterizos). During his reign Granada lost further territory, including Zahara de la Sierra.

Battle of La Higueruela (1431) between John II of Castile and Muhammad IX, Nasrid Sultan of Granada  Campaigns of the Reconquista  After the successful recapturing of the Throne of Granada, the Sultan Muhammad X in 1447, Muhammad IX continued his policies with regards to the Kingdom of Castile. His predecessor (Muhammad X) had managed to retake a few frontier towns from the Kingdom of Murcia through regular raids. Most of these incursions into Castilian territory were taking advantage of the fact that the contemporary ruling family of the Kingdom of Murcia, the House of Fajardo was preoccupied with internal squabbles. The most successful of these incursions resulted in the capturing of the town of Cieza followed closely by a much celebrated victory at the Battle of Hellín, both of which occurred in 1448. The continued incursions by the Emirate of Granada into Murcia obliged the Castilian monarch, John II of Castile to ask for a truce in 1450 in order to be able to better concentrate his own forces in a separate war against Juan Pacheco, the Marquis of Villena. Muhammad IX refused the truce offer in a bid to take full advantage of the disunity amongst the Castilian nobility. The following year, in 1451, the Granadan Sultan launched a fresh incursion into the Kingdom of Murcia which brought back much plunder to Granada's coffers. Between 1451 and 1452, Muhammad IX planned a large scale Algara (Arabic for incursion: الغارة) against the area of Campo de Cartagena. This incursion resulted in the capture of 40,000 heads of cattle and around 40 prisoners, mostly pastors. These Granadan incursions eventually came to a battle at the Battle of Los Alporchones fought near the city of Lorca in 1452. The battle resulted in a Granadan defeat, a truce, and an end to border skirmishes for some time between the kingdoms.

In the United States, the Clean Air Act of 1990 requires that used refrigerant be processed by a certified reclaimer, which must be licensed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the material must be recovered and delivered to the reclaimer by EPA-certified technicians.Section 608 of the Clean Air Act of 1990 Background Coolant and refrigerants are found throughout the industrialized world, in homes, offices, and factories, in devices such as refrigerators, air conditioners, central air conditioning systems (HVAC), freezers, and dehumidifiers. When these units are serviced, there is a risk that refrigerant gas will be vented into the atmosphere, hence the creation of technician training and certification programs in order to ensure that the material is conserved and managed safely. Mistreatment of these gases has been shown to deplete the ozone layer and is suspected to contribute to global warming.Emissions of Greenhouse Gases Report by the US Department of Energy Reclamation of used refrigerant by an EPA-certified reclaimer is required in order to sell used refrigerant not originating from and intended for use with motor vehicle air conditioners and stationary equipment like air conditioners, refrigerators, central air conditioning systems (HVAC), and other cooling equipment. The EPA implemented a Code of Federal Regulations in 1995Code of Federal Regulations: Protection of Stratospheric Ozone in order to develop actions to meet the agreements defined in the Montreal Protocol. Reclamation, as it refers to refrigerants, is one of three components in a refrigerant management process. The EPA defines refrigerant reclamation as \\"Reclaim refrigerant means to reprocess refrigerant to at least the purity specified in appendix A to 40 CFR part 82, subpart F (based on AHRI Standard 700–1993, Specifications for Fluorocarbon and Other Refrigerants) and to verify this purity using the analytical methodology prescribed in appendix A. In general, reclamation involves the use of processes or procedures available only at a reprocessing or manufacturing facility.\\"Protection of Stratospheric Ozone: Supplemental Rule Regarding a Recycling Standard Under Section 608 (Proposed) of the Clean Air Act EPA establishes rules and regulations that reclaimers must acknowledge, and they license these reclaimers to operate. In most cases wholesale distributors provide this service as an intermediary, since they have such great resources to manage distribution. The EPA requires that refrigerant be reclaimed when a certified technician recovers refrigerant and puts it in a special DoT container and has no intention of putting it back in the same system from which it was recovered. Certification program The final rule published on May 14, 1993, requires that refrigerant sold to a new owner be reclaimed to the AHRI Standard 700 of purity by a certified reclaimer (Sec. 82.154(g) and (h) referencing standard in Sec. 82.164 and the definition of reclaim found in Sec. 82.152). As discussed in the final rule, this requirement protects the purity of used refrigerant to prevent damage to air- conditioning and refrigeration equipment from the use of contaminated refrigerant. Equipment damage from contaminated refrigerant would result in costs to equipment owners, in releases of refrigerant from damaged equipment through increased leakage, servicing and replacement, and in reduction in consumer confidence in the quality of used refrigerant. This reduction in consumer confidence could lead to the premature retirement or retrofit of CFC or HCFC equipment since consumers would no longer believe that a sufficient stock of trustworthy refrigerants was available.Protection of Stratospheric Ozone: Direct-Final Rulemaking Temporarily Extend the Existing Requirements AHRI develops standards and manages third party testing and certification programs. AHRI oversees the ARI reclaimer program: Refrigerant Testing Laboratory Certification Find ARI Performance Certified Refrigerant Testing Laboratory Certification. The certification program includes verification for all participating refrigerant testing laboratories, performing ARI-700 testing on any new or reclaimed refrigerants. Certified ratings AHRI also works with many participants in the industry to ensure that the standards that reclaimers are expected to achieve are well defined and support the highest level of integrity so technicians can be confident in the materials they are using and installing. Before reclamation can begin the material must be recovered and the EPA defines that as \\"Recover refrigerant means to remove refrigerant in any condition from an appliance and to store it in an external container without necessarily testing or processing it in any way.\\" Some circumstances where the material is being put back into the system it was removed and not being transferred to a new system the material can be recycled and the EPA defines that as \\"Recycle refrigerant means to extract refrigerant from an appliance and clean refrigerant for reuse without meeting all of the requirements for reclamation.

First elected in 1962, Esau was re-elected in 1964, 1966 and 1968. After sitting out for four years, he opted to run again in 1972, was elected and was re-elected in 1974, 1976, 1978 and 1980. Background From the town of Mountain Lake, Esau, was an automobile garage and body repair shop owner. He served in the United States Army during World War II, being deployed in both the European and Asiatic theatres between 1941 and 1945. Prior to being elected to the Minnesota Legislature, he was a member of the Mountain Lake Village Council from 1954-1963. Service in the Minnesota House Esau represented the old District 18A and, later, 28A, which included all or portions of Brown, Cottonwood, Jackson, Murray and Redwood counties, changing somewhat after the 1972 legislative redistricting. He was, along with senators Dennis Frederickson, Earl Renneke and Jim Vickerman, and representatives Aubrey Dirlam, George Mann, Henry Kalis and Wendell Erickson, one of the longest-serving legislators from southern Minnesota in the state's history. While in the legislature, Esau earned a reputation as a strong advocate for farmers, and as a leader on issues relevant to criminal justice and education. He allied with the Conservative Caucus at a time when the legislature was still officially nonpartisan, and later identified as a Republican when party affiliation became required of candidates. Esau served on the House Agriculture, Criminal Justice, Education, General Legislation, Health & Welfare, Transportation and Veterans & Military Affairs committees, and on various other committee incarnations and subcommittees during his nearly 20 years in office. Active retirement Esau was active and visible in his community, occasionally commenting on issues of interest and note in the local media. His Christian service work included frequent mission trips to such places as Ukraine (his father’s birthplace), Russia, Paraguay, Peru, and the Philippines. In 2009, Esau authored a memoir detailing his military service with the U.S. Army in both the Asian and European theatres during World War II, entitled My World War II Memories. A series of interviews with him were also conducted to document his experiences as a World War II serviceman. These interviews can be found on YouTube. Esau died on July 16, 2012.

The stew generally contains potatoes and a meat such as chicken, duck, goat, beef, conch or shrimp. Roti is eaten widely across the West Indies, especially in countries with large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from South Asia, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of Guyana, Suriname,Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Jamaica and South Africa. In the West Indies, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break it by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the West Indies, the term \\"roti\\" may refer to both the flat-bread itself as well as the more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap. The \\"roti wrap\\" is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in Southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments; pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango chutney are the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean. \\"Roti shops\\" are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago and the wrapped roti is a staple street food. The wrap is now simply referred to as roti or just roti. As Caribbeans moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. This iconic version is what most North Americans know as roti. The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flat-bread itself that surrounds the filling as a \\"roti skin\\" or \\"roti shell.\\" This practice is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. It is most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. West Indian style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a tawa. Certain rotis are also made with butter. Often, dal is added. The Guyanese style of roti is arguably one of the most popular styles of roti within Guyana and the Caribbean.

The IAR 15 was designed by Elie Carafoli for the Romanian Air Force. It was a lightly armed low-wing cantilever monoplane with a radial engine, fixed undercarriage and open cockpit. Development The sustained efforts of Elie Carafoli and his team paid dividends when the first order for IAR 14 was finally placed. With production started and a small profit secured, Dipl.-Eng. Carafoli decided to try something new. The result was the I.A.R. 15. The inline engine was abandoned and instead a radial powerplant was substituted. Accordingly, the front fuselage underwent a major redesign. The cross-section was rounded and an NACA ring covered the 600 h.p. (447 kW) Gnome & Rhône 9Krse engine. With the new nine-cylinder radial the aircraft attained a top speed of 375 km/h at 4,000 m and could climb to 5,000 m in 8 minutes. The ceiling was raised to 10,500 m and an endurance of 600 km was possible. The I.A.R. 15 could intercept any contemporary major bomber type. Alongside the new front fuselage section, other structural changes had been implemented as well. The cross-section of the rear fuselage was enlarged and reinforced. The fuselage was a steel tube structure covered with dural forward of the cockpit and fabric aft. The tail was redesigned again, this time to a triangular shape and was also built of steel tube and dural-covered. An aerodynamically improved single strut undercarriage featuring wheel spats was fitted near the wing roots and a small wheel replaced the previous tailskid. Instead of the crash- pylon featured on earlier models, a rounded knob appeared behind the pilot's headrest. The wings were rounded and shortened to 11.00 m, giving 19.00 m² total area, and were built around two dural spars with a mixture of wood and metal ribs. The open cockpit was aft of the wing trailing edge. The undercarriage had a wide track, with vertical wire braced and faired legs carrying spatted main wheels. Power was from an I.A.R. 9KIc40 licence-built Gnome-Rhône 9K engine of 450 kW (600 hp) enclosed in a NACA cowling. In the first prototype this drove a two-bladed wooden airscrew, but later machines had three-bladed metal propellers. Five prototypes were built. Tests showed that the IAR 15 was as fast as competing aircraft, chiefly the PZL P.11, but less manoeuvrable and no other orders were placed. Operational history In all aspects, the I.A.R.-15, test flown in early 1934 by 1st Lt. Alex. Papana, was a good match for other monoplane fighter types of its time, such as the Dewoitine D.500 of L'Armée de l'Air, the Boeing P-26 \\"Peashooter\\" of the U.S. Army Air Corps or the Polikarpov I-16 of the Voyenno-vozdushnyye sily. The speed capability of the I.A.R.15 was judged excellent and it established a national altitude record of 11631m in 1936.

Officially the son of a poor blacksmith, he worked as a youth in the wool industry in Florence under another name, until he was alleged to be a natural son of Ercole Bentivoglio. He was educated at Florence in the court of Cosimo de' Medici the Elder and possessed a vast culture. Through his putative noble father, Sante can pretend to be a cousin of Annibale I Bentivoglio, at the time ruler of Bologna (also of dubious paternity). When Annibale was killed in an ambuscade by a rival family, the people of Bologna gave him the government of their city with the title of Gonfaloniere di Giustizia. He was also named as sole tutor of Annibale's son, Giovanni. The event transformed Sante from a Florentine popolano into the virtual prince of Bologna. It was with Sante Bentivoglio's seizure of power, encouraged by the Duke of Milan, that the Signoria was ultimately established in Bologna. In 1454 he married Ginevra Sforza, then fourteen years old, the daughter of Alessandro Sforza, lord of Pesaro, establishing his family's close relationship with the Sforza dynasty.Rossetti, L., 'Il Matrimonio de Sante Bentivoglio con Ginevra Sforza (1454)', Bollettino della Societa Bolognese di Storia Patria, 1916. The two had two daughters: Costanza (1458–1491), who married Antonmaria Pico della Mirandola, and Ercola (1459–1505). He also had a son Ercole (1459-1507), who became a condottiero and fought for Florence in several successive wars. In 1457 the Pope and Sante Bentivoglio created a mixed constitutional state in Bologna. In 1460 Sante started building the impressive Palazzo Bentivoglio, which was destroyed in 1507 after the Bentivoglio were ousted from Bologna. He obtained from the pope's autonomy of government over the city and established a communal senate including local nobles and Papal representants. He worked in cooperation with the representatives of the pope: Pius II even visited Bologna two times in 1458 and 1459. It did not trust them however and said on one occasion: \\"The blood of my own kin has taught me a bitter lesson as to the little faith that can be placed in priests.\\"Prescot, O., Princes of the Renaissance, New York: Ransom House, 1969, p. 326. Politically, he allied with the Republic of Venice, the House of Sforza and the house of Medici, playing on the Venetian fear of both Milan and Florence. He died in Bologna in 1462 due to illness, being succeeded by Giovanni II Bentivoglio, Annibale's son, who later remarried his widow Ginevra. The great Bolognese historian Cherubino Ghirardacci wrote that 'Sante Bentivoglio had achieved the highest reputation, not just among the citizens of Bologna, but also among the lords of Italy, which was a marvellous thing' References 1426 births 1462 deaths Sante 1 ","title":"Sante Bentivoglio"},{"id":"21228221","text":"Henry Pease (4 May 1807 – 30 May 1881) was an English railway owner, peace campaigner and a Liberal politician who represented Durham South.

Normally, the monsters would do harmless things. But suddenly, on her sixteenth birthday, the creatures she sees take it farther by trying to kill her. She's saved by a childhood friend from her past, Kyo Usui, who just so happens to be a demon, or yōkai, as well as the clan leader of the tengu. She finds out that she is the rare \\"Bride of Prophecy\\", also known as \\"The Senka\\" or \\"The Holy Fruit\\", and depends on Kyo for protection from those who wish to eat her for her blood, which gives the consumer incredible power. She further gets to know that marrying her brings immense prosperity to the whole demon clan of the groom and is thus the object of conflict among the clan leaders of different demon clans, who want to be her suitors. Kyo wants to marry her but to do so he has to put more than just his life at stake. Moreover, the \\"Senkaroku\\", or \\"Record of the Holy Fruit\\", restricts their love.  Characters  =Main characters= ; :Misao is a sixteen-year-old high school student. She has been plagued with the ability to see demons ever since birth. Because of her ability, she was never able to make any friends until she met Kyō. The monsters were harmless until her sixteenth birthday; on the day she turned sixteen, a monster possessing one of the school's idols attacks her. Before she was injured any further, Kyō came to save her and healed her wound by licking it. It is then that she discovers that he is a demon and that she is the \\"bride of the prophecy\\" for the head of the Tengu Clan; she was chosen to be the wife of the next head of the clan ten years ago. When she was a child, Misao became attached to Kyo and they had made a promise that she would be his bride. However, she was supposed to marry Kyo's older brother, Sho, who was the heir to the clan. As a result, Kyo left Misao's side in order to surpass him and become the heir. At first, she was scared of Kyo for his stoic personality and demonic powers but grows to trust that he is willing to do anything to be with her. She later falls in love with Kyo and decides to fulfill her promise to him by becoming his wife, once she graduates high school. They begin a romantic and sexual relationship from then on. After Sho's death, Misao notices a change in her powers, which no one is able to touch her and her scent is overwhelming. It is discovered that this is because Misao is pregnant with a demon child. Despite being told the baby could kill her during childbirth, she refuses to abort it because she has grown to love her unborn child. Misao gives birth to a boy whom she named Sou. Instead of dying, a miracle happens when Misao wakes up, and even though it costs her most of her ability to walk, she is able to live happily with Kyo and Sou. ; :Kyo is the heir to the Tengu Clan. It is revealed that Kyo is not human but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grows longer, he has black wings, and he wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak.

Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and he fell in love with her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be the clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door to hers and took a job as a math teacher at her school. He is always protecting her and healing her wounds, and finding moments to steal a kiss from her. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Sho. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspects of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon. He is initially happy about the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that she loves the baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, due to a miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou. =Tengu Clan members= ;Sou Usui :Misao and Kyo's son. He is the current heir to the Tengu clan. He resembles Kyo greatly and acts like him. He is born in the final chapter. According to the Immortal Fruit Record, children of the Immortal Fruit will kill their mothers soon after birth. As a result, Kyo wanted Misao to abort the baby, but she refused. After discovering her pregnancy, Misao had recurring dreams of a little boy with black wings and introduces himself as Sou, and discovers that it is her unborn son. Kyo comes to care about the baby once Misao tells him that Sou loves him. When he is born, Misao survives the childbirth, and Misao and Kyo begin raising Sou as a family. Although he is well-loved by both of his parents, Sou is jealous that his father loves his mother more, and complains how strict Kyo is with him while Misao is very loving. ;Yoh Usui :Kyo's father and the former head of the Tengu Clan. He married Yuri, who was eleven years his junior, and through their marriage, Sho and Kyo were born. He is rarely present in the family and acts indifferent towards his sons. Kyo believes that he doesn't love or care for him, his brother, and his mother. Kyo initially believes that his father murdered his mother after they engaged in a heated argument, but this turns out to be false, and Yoh actually feels guilty for his wife's death because he feels it was his fault. Despite this, neither Kyo or Sho have any sympathy for their father. He is determined to have one of his sons marry Misao and father an heir for the clan. He is very fond of Misao, whom he remembers from her childhood. ;Yuri Usui :Kyo's mother. She is Yoh's wife, and eleven years his junior. Her marriage to Yoh was always troubling. Before she died, she had a physical argument with Yoh, and soon after, she died from poisoning. This causes Kyo to believe she was murdered by Yoh, but it turns out that she had actually committed suicide. ; :Kyo's older brother, and original heir to the Tengu Clan. He is 22-years-old when he is first introduced. Once the clan realized how cruel he is, Kyo became the heir. When he was the heir, he was supposed to marry Misao. However, he is very cruel to her and does not love her, and even slapped her as a child. He hates that his brother was always there in case he failed to harm Misao. The previous Clan Leader called Kyo \\"the spare tire\\" or \\"back-up plan\\" because Sho was deemed unfit as the heir due to his abusive and cruel nature. While he despises Misao, he hates that she chose Kyo over him because it made him feel useless to the clan. In later chapters, however, he shows an emotional side, as he saves Misao from being crushed to death inside a storage house. He is later brought back to life by the efforts of his former attendant Roh. In the last battle between the two brothers, he is killed, but warns Kyo that he wouldn't be like him and kill Misao, implying that he read the last pages of the Immortal Fruit Record. ; Taro :One of the eight daitengu. He has two brothers, Jiro and Saburo, and they are triplets. They are six years old. After nearly being killed by Sho, Kyo trained him to become stronger. He enjoys cooking and preparing food for Kyo and Misao, and tending to the flowers in the courtyard, despite how much Kyo doesn't like plants that are grown by others. ;Jiro :One of the eight daitengu. He is the triplet brother of Taro and Saburo. He resembles Kyo almost as if they are related, which they are not. He loves Misao as a big sister figure and likes seeing her smile. He is later put in charge of taking care of Sou, which annoys him, as Sou tends to hide from and refuse to listen to him. ;Saburo :One of the eight daitengu. He is the triplet brother of Taro and Jiro. He has bushy dark hair, and enjoys doing things for Kyo and Misao. ; Sagami (real name Ryo) :Another of the eight daitengu. He is very protective of Kyo, and dislikes Misao at first but he later grows to like her due to her caring personality. He is Hoki's older brother. He has a sickly wife named Ayame, who was later cured by drinking Misao's blood. He is 24 years old and trained the daitengu to fight. Years later, he and Ayame have a son, Ryu, and a daughter, Tsubaki. He and Hoki are the last daitengu to serve Kyo. ; Hoki (real name Yu) :Another of the eight daitengu, and Sagami's younger brother. He is 15 years old and he looks very feminine. He is very loyal to Kyo and Misao. By the end of the series, he and Sagami are the last daitengu to serve Kyo. ; Buzen :Another one of the eight daitengu who's a playboy but a mature person. He is 26 years old. He had loved Kyo and Sho's mother because he considered her to be the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, although he continues to flirt with other young women. A few years after Sou is born, Buzen quits the daitengu and left for an unknown position. ; Zenki (real name Gou) :Another one of the eight daitengu. Misao thinks he's scary but an easy- going and funny person. He's 20 years old. He loves and protects children who lost their families. A few years after Sou is born, Zenki quits the daitengu and undergoes training to be a monk at an orphanage. =Supporting characters= ; Shuhei Kuzunoha :Leader of the Kitsune Clan. He is killed by Kyo when they fought for Misao's love. ; Tadanobu Kuzunoha :Kyo's childhood friend. They met completely by accident, and formed a friendship based on their shared love of porn. He allowed his younger brother Shuhei to beat him when they fought for the leadership of the Kitsune Clan, because he never wanted to fight his best friend. He is in love with a human girl named Renko. After Kyo kills Shuhei, he becomes the head of the Kitsune Clan. Eventually, he is forced to challenge Kyo for Misao, but loses. However, he is allowed to live. ; Renko Jounouchi :A human girl who attends the university that Misao's father teaches at. She is Tadanobu's lover, and will do anything to protect him. She even goes as far as to threaten to kill Kyo if he hurts Tadanobu. She has competed in archery tournaments in the past. Eventually, she is accepted by the Kitsune Clan. Only Tadanobu is allowed to call her Ren. ; Yoshio Harada :Misao's father. He is a university professor and participates in digs. He teaches Renko, who attends the same university. He is very protective of Misao, but says that he will accept Kyo as her boyfriend if he makes her happy. When Misao becomes pregnant, he is happy and encourages her and Kyo to be happy with their child, Sou, whom he dotes on. ; Yoko Harada :Misao's mother. She remembers Kyo from his and Misao's childhood and trusts him a lot, despite knowing little about him. She is initially upset when Misao becomes pregnant, but agrees to let her and Kyo marry. In chapter 69, she discovers Kyo's secret as a demon when he saves her; however, she believes that Kyo will be a good husband to Misao and father to Sou. ; Kensuke Dodoji :A snake demon, and heir to his clan. He is very shy, unlike his twin sister Kiyo. He becomes friends with Misao, but is supposed to take her as his own. However, he is much too softhearted to do this. He gives Misao poison, which she uses to paralyze Sho. ; Kiyo Dodoji :Another snake demon, and Kensuke's twin sister. She is in love with Kyo, and will do anything to get him. She is very beautiful. She shows up at Misao's school, and asks her to give up Kyo. ; Ayame :Sagami's wife. She is very sickly, but gets extremely excited when Sagami gets a chance to visit her. She is cured by drinking some of Misao's blood. She has the power to show images in a pool of water. She watched over Misao, while Kyo was away from her for ten years. She also watched over Sho, and he learned this skill just by watching her. She began to like Ryo when she was 15 years old. He wasn't her first crush but the first person she ever kissed. Years later, they have a son and a daughter, Ryu and Tsubaki. ;Raikoh Watanabe :Like Misao he can see demons and spirits, and is also in love with her. However, he refuses to believe that humans and demons can live in harmony and uses his abilities to destroy them. Due to this, despite Misao and Kyo's attempts to prove that not all demons are like the one who scarred him, due to his attempts to destroy their relationship, ignoring the fact his actions put them both in grave danger, it looks like they will forever be on bad terms. ;Roh :The man who resurrected Sho after he was trapped under the storage house. He was Sho's servant until he died while resurrecting Sho. He has a daughter named Kaede. ;Kaede :Her father Roh supported Sho's ambitions to seize clan leadership. She is Sho's attendant, after he returns to the village. She was abandoned by her parents as a child and became an outcast in the village because of it. She also fell in love with Kyo because he was outcast by the village for trying to become the new clan head. She develops a strong hatred for Misao because of her feelings for Kyo. She later commits suicide in an attempt to prevent Sho's death, showing twisted feelings of love for him.

It had already been performed in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia before opening at the Lyric Theatre, London, on 21 January 2009. The show was conceived by Jackson family friend and author Adrian Grant. Background Adrian Grant started a British fan club in 1988, and then Jackson invited him out to Los Angeles when he was recording Dangerous. Within a few years the fan club had grown to 25,000 subscribed members. This led to an annual Michael Jackson tribute show in the United Kingdom from 1991; Jackson attended the tenth anniversary event. Each tribute show attracted anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 people. Grant also wrote three books, including Michael Jackson – The Visual Documentary which was approved by the singer. Jackson was never involved with the production of Thriller – Live, but he wished Grant luck with the production. Productions In August 2006, Thriller – Live was previewed in the United Kingdom, at the Dominion Theatre. The show was originally directed and choreographed by Kerys Nathan and with additional choreography by LaVelle Smith Jr.. The following year, Grant, backed by Flying Music, began production for a UK Tour featuring the talents of Shaheen Jafargholi depicting the young Michael in the Jackson 5. The adult singers included Pop Idol star Zoe Birkett and Filipino-Australian vocalist Mig Ayesa. The show played a successful set of dates throughout May and June 2007, and later that year it toured in Europe. Production for the West End version began in 2008, when open auditions were held to find a young actor to play Jackson. Ultimately six people would play the singer, going through the various stages of his career, with a total cast of 21 individuals, including Denise Pearson. Gary Lloyd directed and choreographed the show. The West End premiere was on 21 January 2009, at the Lyric Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue. Tito Jackson other celebrities attended the premiere. La Toya Jackson attended the after show party.http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/23499/thriller-live- extends-its-west-end-run-by Thriller – Live was originally scheduled to run until 16 May 2009, but this date was extended several times following wide public interest, especially after Jackson's death on June 25, 2009. In September 2014, it became the 20th longest-running musical in West End. In October 2019 it was announced that the show would close in April 2020. The show closed prematurely on 15 March 2020 due to the theatre's closure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thriller – Live played in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands, Grand Theater, in May 2011. Commentary Karen Fricker of Variety expressed the opinion that the musical had \\"remarkably high production value\\" but was too long. Fricker continued, \\"Jackson's hits sung by four strong-voiced, charismatic leads, backed by a crackerjack team of singer- dancers—is effective and entertaining\\". Sanjoy Roy of The Guardian observed, \\"It's cute, kicking and retro, but also highlights a danger that looms large in this show: that even as a tot, Jackson was supremely gifted performer—both as a singer and a dancer—and this tribute, however well intended, inevitably pales by comparison.\\" Paul Vale of The Stage stated, \\"Those looking for history of Jackson's personal life should look elsewhere as this theatrical extravaganza is a breathtaking celebration of a musician whose work spans over three decades... Jonathan Park's set design and Nigel Catmur's lighting are complimented by LED screens creating some wonderful theatrical set pieces that are simple and yet remarkably effective\\". Benedict Nightingale of The Times said of one performer, \\"What [he] lacks in physical similarity to Jackson he also lacks vocally. The coarse, sandy qualities of his voice are as suited to \\"Rock with You\\" as custard is on a steak\\". Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph commented, \\"Gary Lloyd, who doubles as director and choreographer, keeps the energy level at fever pitch almost throughout, and his dance routines, featuring daring leaps from an on-stage bridge, break-dancing, and, yes, the moonwalk, are spectacular. There is also a terrific band, ranging with aplomb from funk, soul and disco, through candy-rush pop to guitar-led rock\\". Malcolm Jack of The Scotsman noted that, \\"Some of Jackson's best numbers - \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"Beat It\\" - were treated rather underwhelmingly, but the faithful(ish) to the video centrepieces - \\"Smooth Criminal\\", \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Thriller\\" - were fairly spectacular\\". Amber Windsor of This Is Local London said of her experience at one show, \\"The signature high-pitched yee hee' echoed from the foyer and it was endearing to see a young boy recreating Michael's signature moonwalk, proving Jackson's music still appeals to all ages...The stage was vibrantly brought to life by the dancers, easily the strongest element of Thriller Live. Their endless energy and clear passion for the music reflected Jackson's own style\\". Mel Bradley of Dinnington Guardian recalled his enthusiasm and enjoyment while observing the musical, despite not being an \\"ardent fan of the king of pop\\". Julie Carpenter of Daily Express stated, \\"...this is a hugely enjoyable, gloriously upbeat, high-energy show which leaves you chanting Annie, are you OK? Are you OK, Annie? as you slip out the door\\". On June 21, 2010, six performers in the London cast released \\"Speechless\\" as a single, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Jackson's death. All proceeds from the recording were donated to the charity War Child.

It runs annually from late June through the end of July. The workshop is limited to 18 students per year. Each of the six weeks is instructed by a different professional writer or editor. The roster of guest instructors changes yearly. Founded in Seattle, Washington in 1971, the workshop has been held continuously since 1984. Clarion West celebrated its 25th anniversary of continuous instruction in 2008.\\"Clarion West Turns 25\\". Locus Magazine, September 2008: Page 5 The Clarion West board of directors currently includes Susan Gossman, Miriah Hetherington, Tod McCoy, Vicki Saunders, Rashida J. Smith, Nisi Shawl, Misha Stone, and Yang-Yang Wang.  History  The 1971 Clarion West Writers Workshop was founded by Vonda N. McIntyre, a Clarion Workshop graduate and Nebula and Hugo Award-winning author, with the support of original Clarion founder Robin Scott Wilson. It was modeled after the original Clarion Workshop founded in 1968 at Clarion University of Pennsylvania (itself inspired by the Milford Writer's Workshop). The original Clarion Workshop was slated to close after holding final classes in 1970, and the effort was made to establish and continue Clarion workshops in other locations. The 1971 successor workshops that sprang from this effort were Clarion West Workshop founded in Seattle, and Clarion Workshop revived in New Orleans (later moved to Michigan in 1972, and San Diego in 2007). Clarion West operated until 1973, before a hiatus.Wilhem, Kate. Storyteller: Writing Lessons and More from 27 Years of the Clarion Writers' Workshop, Small Beer Press, Easthampton, MA 2005 : Pages 32-35. In 1984, Clarion West graduate J.T. Stewart and Seattle writer, Marilyn J. Holt, reconvened the workshop with the support of founder Vonda N. McIntyre. Clarion West incorporated as a nonprofit organization with a board of directors in 1986 with the help of many dedicated Clarion West alumni. Currently the workshop is administered by Neile Graham and Jae Steinbacher. Although the workshop is located in close proximity to the University of Washington, it is not associated with the university. It has operated continuously to the present day.About Clarion West: http://www.clarionwest.org/about  Workshop format  The workshop is combination of instruction and mutual student critique using the Clarion Method. The emphasis of learning is primarily geared toward hours spent reading, writing and critiquing. Normally, students are expected to write one complete draft of a story per week, to be critiqued the following week. Ideas for these stories are up to the student, but the emphasis is that the writing takes place on premises where fresh lessons and insight can be immediately applied to new story ideas. Work on 'trunk' stories, written before the workshop, is discouraged. The class lecture and critique runs weekdays from morning to early afternoon. The remainder of the day is typically divided between writing for the next week's story deadline, reading, and preparing critiques. The workload is intense, but breaks and socializing are typical at all hours. Weekends are free time to socialize, explore the local sights, and catch up on unfinished writing and reading. Each student typically gets a weekly private conference with each instructor to ask questions and gain insight from that professional writer or editor. Although the focus of the workshop is on speculative fiction, such as science fiction and fantasy, other genres, including horror, comedy, mystery, and literary writing (and mixtures thereof) regularly grace the workshop stories. The workshop focuses on writing and critiquing short stories, but many aspects of novel writing are also discussed in workshop.Clarion West Introductory Information for Students Handout, 2008  Extracurricular activities  The speculative fiction community around the Seattle area has built support for the workshop over the years, and many special events have become part of the Clarion West tradition.Howle, Leslie. \\"Twenty Five Years of Clarion West\\". Seventh Week, Fall 2008: Pages 4-5 *Clarion West Parties: These invitation-only events are attended by the students and administrators, graduated alumni, and many established writers, editors, agents, and fans in the industry. * Readings and Book Signings: These public events allow students and the public to experience readings by the instructing writers. They are regularly hosted by the local University Book Store.University Book Store : http://www.ubookstore.com/ * Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame/Locus Awards weekend: frequently the workshop coincides with the yearly Locus Awards and Science Fiction Hall of Fame weekend events. This is a chance for students to participate in events that typically draw writers and professionals from around the globe.  Traditions  There are a number of class traditions passed down from one class to the next in the manner of a secret society. Traditions that are publicly known include the yearly Clarion West class shirt (designed by the class and limited only to the classmates and instructors of that year),Example of a Clarion West class shirt, 2004: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/343613/ and the practice of presenting unusual gifts to each of the instructors. Classes often come up with new traditions and items to pass on to the next year's class.  Applications  Space in the workshop is awarded to the top 18 applicants of all submissions received. The average number of applications is not disclosed and varies year to year. The application window typically opens December 1 and runs through March 1 for the year attending. Students are usually selected and informed of acceptance by the end of March.Workshop Application Guidelines: http://www.clarionwest.org/workshop/apply Although Clarion West and Clarion are run independently, they follow the same workshop method and are considered sister schools. Since both workshops run concurrently, students are often encouraged to apply to both workshops to increase their chances of attending that year. Students accepted to both programs must choose their preferred workshop. Each of the schools has similar but distinct guidelines. Students that graduate one of the Clarion workshops are considered alumni of all the Clarion programs, and may not re-apply for any other Clarion Workshop.

The scandal involves unauthorized trading over a 10-year period by Hamanaka, which led Sumitomo to announce $1.8 billion USD in related losses in 1996 when Hamanaka's trading was discovered, and more related losses subsequently. The scandal also involved Hamanaka's attempts to corner the entire world's copper market through LME Copper futures contracts on the London Metal Exchange (LME). The affair was a major scandal which is at times compared in magnitude to the Silver Thursday scandal, involving the Hunt family's attempt to corner the world's silver markets. It currently ranks in the top 10 trading losses in financial history. Hamanaka's decade of unauthorized trading Hamanaka and his superior, Saburo Shimizu, began speculating without authorization using Copper forward contracts on the LME in 1985 in an attempt to recoup an earlier loss from their trading in physical copper in the Philippines. They were not successful, and their losses rose to $60 million USD. Shimizu resigned at this point. Both traders felt that they could not report these losses to their superiors, but Hamanaka believed he could recover the losses through further trading. Hamanaka would state later at his trial in 1997 that his motivation for the scheme was to cover earlier losses, both before and during his promotion to Sumitomo's head Copper trader, and not for personal gain. Shimizu supports his account of this motivation. Whatever his motivations, Hamanaka hid his losses by keeping a secret book of unauthorized trading, and by destroying documents, lying to his supervisors, forging trading data, and forging signatures. These tactics successfully hid his actvities and Sumitomo promoted him to head Copper trader in 1986. =Different schemes to recoup losses= To recoup his earlier trading losses, Hamanaka embarks on a variety of schemes to profitably trade Copper by cornering the market. Depending on the context, prosecutors usually focus on just one or two of the schemes depending on their interest and jurisdiction. Hamanaka's dealings with David Campbell began in 1989 with a discussion about his intentions of driving up the Copper price by cornering the world market. Campbell was then president of the private metals trading firm RST Resources, inc. (RST). From 1989 to 1992, Hamanaka conducted significant amounts of business with RST, and became the firm's biggest client. In 1993, Campbell resigned from RST and founded Global Minerals and Mining Corp (Global), and Hamanaka switched to doing business with Global. Hamanaka entered into a string of monthly purchasing agreements with Global from 1994 to 1997. Hamanaka would purchase physical copper warrants, or claims on physical copper stored in warehouses, from Global, which purchased them from a Zambian copper producer. Hamanaka would then sell the warrants back to the Zambian producer to repeat the cycle. These transactions allowed Hamanaka to establish the appearance of a real copper business, and to allow him to claim commercial hedging justification to establish large futures positions to supposedly hedge the illusory transactions. With the false commercial justification established, Hamanaka established a massive long Copper futures contract position on the LME through an account established at Merrill Lynch for Global and through other small brokers. By September 1995, Sumitomo possessed two million metric tons of Copper in the form of futures contracts, and nearly one half of LME Copper warrants. At this point, Hamanaka began to take delivery of copper warrants from expiring LME Copper contracts, which consolidated his control over the Copper cash market. By November 24, 1995, Hamanaka controlled 93% of LME Copper warrants, and a dominant position in the LME Copper futures contract market. This forced traders who were short LME Copper futures, and who could not deliver physical copper, to purchase LME Copper futures from Hamanaka at high prices near the expiry of the contract to offset their position. Hamanaka's dealings with David Threlkeld resulted in two attempts to warn the LME on Hamanaka's trading practices. Threlkeld's company, DLT Inc, traded copper for Hamanaka, and Paul Scully, a DLT employee, warned Threlkeld about problems in Hamanaka's trading practices in 1991. Scully would die in a July 1991 fire, which raised suspicions in 1996 after Hamanaka's fraudulent trading became public; however, two investigations ruled the fire was accidental. Threlkeld had separately received faxes from Hamanaka requesting to document $500 million of non-existent trades on DLT letterhead. Threlkeld refused, and complained to the LME. The LME discussed the letter with the Securities and Investments Board and Sumitomo managemnet. Ultimately the LME decided it did not have jurisdiction to bring enforcement action against Hamanaka, but the LME did pressure Sumitomo to release Hamanaka's letter to the public, which did not result in any repercussions to Hamanaka at the time. Threlkeld separately confronted two of his employees in the DLT London office, Charles Vincent and Ashley Levett. Threlkeld subsequently fired Vincent, and Levett quit DLT. The two traders founded Winchester Commodities Group afterwards. =Role of US Banks= US Banks made loans to Hamanaka, sometimes in the form of unusual loan arrangements, that allowed Hamanaka to cover his losses and prolong his trading activity. As Hamanaka accumulated trading losses, he borrowed money to extend his positions or to hide losses. More than a dozen brokers at the LME had each extended on average $150 million USD as credit lines to Hamanaka by mid-1993, and he faced difficulties obtaining more credit. To continue his activities, Hamanaka started borrowing from US banks in 1994. J.P. Morgan extended about $400 million USD of credit to Hamanaka, and Chase Manhattan extended $500 million USD. Separately, Merrill Lynch lent Hamanaka $500 million USD to purchase Copper warrants, and $100 million USD in Commodity Inventory Purchase Obligations. Without credit from US banks, Hamanaka might not have been able to hide his losses for as long as he did, which might have led to the discovery of his trading schemes much sooner and reduced the eventual losses to Sumitomo. =Role of the LME= Hamanaka traded on the LME directly, and also traded indirectly with other parties with indirectly relationships with LME through Over-the-Counter transactions. Contracts on the LME held as forward contracts, which allowed Hamanaka to maintain positions through credit without covering daily mark-to-market margin payments with cash. By mid-1993, Hamanaka had more than a dozen credit lines with different LME brokers of $150 million USD each to maintain his Copper positions. The LME also had relatively lighter reporting and supervisory requirements relative to the COMEX (now Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Copper futures market. As Hamanaka's actions began to raise the price of LME Copper contracts, LME Copper futures contracts began to trade at a premium over COMEX Copper futures contracts, and began to attract physical copper supplies to move from COMEX warehouses into LME warehouses, in particular LME's new Long Beach warehouse opened in 1994. At this point Copper prices entered into a state of backwardation, when Copper spot prices became higher than Copper futures prices. Market participants and regulators began to observe that Copper stocks in COMEX warehouses began to decrease as expected in this environment, since merchants earn more selling Copper stocks immediately than selling it later, whereas LME Copper stocks continued to increase despite a discount on forward selling prices. This warehouse behaviour led US regulators to more closely investigate Sumitomo. =Scheme collapse= The growing Copper stocks at the LME Long Beach warehouse, and the related draining of Copper stocks at COMEX warehouses caused the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate the Copper market. However, the CFTC was only able to get the LME, Securities and Investments Board (SIB), and Sumitomo to start an investigation into Hamanaka's copper trading on April 1996, many months after Hamanaka was able to establish his market position. Chapter 7: Sumitomo, pp. 97–101. Sumitomo discovered Hamanaka's unauthorized account and positions at Merrill Lynch and removed Hamanaka from his post on May 9, 1996. Hamanaka confessed to the scheme on June 5, 1996. On June 13th, 1996, Sumitomo announced $1.8 billion USD of losses related to Hamanaka's trades. Sumitomo then began to unwind Hamanaka's futures and cash copper positions, which cause Copper prices to plummet from a high of $2800 USD in May 1996 to a two and a half year low of $1785 USD on June 25, 1996. Sumitomo eventually suffered $2.6 billion USD in losses from Hamanaka's positions, and a further $200 million USD related to subsequent lawsuits on the affair. Aftermath In 1997, a Tokyo court found Hamanaka guilty on four counts of forgery and fraud and sentenced him to eight years in jail. Hamanaka was not prosecuted with market manipulation, but Sumitomo paid fines of $150 million USD to CFTC and $8 million USD to the SIB to settle charges of Copper price manipulations. In 1999, Sumitomo sued Merrill Lynch, UBS, Credit-Lyonnais Rouse, and Morgan Stanley for damages in an amount exceeding $2 billion USD for aiding and abetting Hamanaka.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for most of the period between 1905 and 1918, representing three different constituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Early life Muldoon was the third son of James Muldoon of Dromore, County Tyrone, and of Catherine Gahan. He was educated at a local school and at Queen's College, Galway. He was called to the Irish bar in 1894 and became a K.C. (King's Counsel) in 1913.Ferguson, 2005. In 1903 he married Olive, daughter of Charles Whamond of Westport, County Mayo. Political career Muldoon was a treasurer of the United Irish League and a Director of the Freeman's Journal. He was returned unopposed as MP for the Irish Parliamentary Party in North Donegal at a by-election in June 1905 but did not stand again at the general election of January 1906, being deselected by the local clergy.Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891-1918, \\"Who's Who\\" p.236, Gill & Macmillan (1999) In July 1907 he was elected unopposed at a by-election for East Wicklow, and was re-elected at both general elections of 1910, unopposed in January 1910 and by almost two to one over a Unionist in the December 1910 election. In July 1911 he resigned and stood for the East Cork seat of fellow Nationalist Captain A. J. C. Donelan, who had been unseated following an election petition, having defeated William O'Brien the previous December. Donelan succeeded Muldoon unopposed in East Wicklow, while Muldoon was in the event returned unopposed in East Cork. Muldoon was politically very active from 1900–1914. His particular interests were the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the Land Acts and the Labourers (Ireland) Act 1906, on all of which he published a number of works. He was a close political confidant of John Dillon, while said to be close to John Redmond and Joseph Devlin.Irish Times: Obituary John Muldoon K.C., 22 November 1938 Muldoon retired from politics at the general election of 1918. In 1921 he was appointed Registrar in Lunacy and five years later, after the establishment of the Irish Free State, as Registrar in the office of the Chief Justice of Ireland, retiring in 1935.

Two distinct designs used the Detroiter name, a biplane and a monoplane. Development The first design from the Detroit- based Stinson Aircraft Syndicate was the Stinson SB-1 Detroiter, a four-seat cabin biplane with novel features such as cabin heating, individual wheel brakes and electric starter for the nose-mounted 220 hp (164 kW) Wright J-5 Whirlwind engine. It made its first flight on Jan 25th, 1926. The Harley Davidson brakes were demonstrated on a snowy maiden flight requiring wheel chains to be added to prevent skidding. This aircraft was soon developed into the six-seat Stinson SM-1D Detroiter, a braced high-wing monoplane version which ultimately made quite a number of significant long-range flights.Stinson Aircraft Corporation The aircraft was soon a success and it enabled Stinson to get $150,000 in public capital to incorporate the Stinson Aircraft Corporation on 4 May 1926. Seventy-five of the Wright J-5-powered versions were built, followed by 30 Wright J-6-powered aircraft. From 1928, SM-1 aircraft were used on scheduled services by Paul Braniff's Braniff Air Lines and by Northwest Airways.Davies, 1998, p. 734 In 1930 a SM-1FS with a crew of three reached Bermuda from New York City, the first flight ever to the islands. Getting there the aircraft had to land twice, once because of darkness and later after running out of fuel. With a wing strut damaged, it was shipped back to New York.UNUSUAL PLACE – UNUSUAL STORY – HEROIC CREW In 1928 Stinson developed the smaller SM-2 Junior model to appeal to private owners.

They were classified as a branch of the Trans–New Guinea languages (TNG) by Stephen Wurm (1975) and Malcolm Ross (2005), but removed (along with the related Goilalan languages) by Timothy Usher (2020). The Binandere family proper is transparently valid; Ross connected it to the Guhu-Semane isolate based on pronominal evidence, and this has been confirmed by Smallhorn (2011). Proto- Binanderean has been reconstructed in Smallhorn (2011). There is evidence that settlements of people speaking Oceanic languages along the Binanderean coast were gradually absorbed into inland communities speaking Binanderean languages (Bradshaw 2017). Classification Greater Binanderean consists of the Guhu- Samane language and the Binanderean languages proper. Smallhorn (2011:444) provides the following classification: *Greater Binanderean Guhu-Samane Binanderean *Yekora *North Binanderean Suena Zia *Nuclear Binanderean Binandere South Binanderean *Orokaivic Aeka (Northern Orokaiva) Orokaiva Hunjara (Mountain Orokaiva) *Coastal Binanderean Notu-Yega (Ewage) Gaena-Korafe Baruga However, Central Binanderean and Nuclear Binanderean are non- genealogical linkages. Usher (2020), who calls the Binanderean languages proper \\"Oro\\" after Oro Province, classifies them very similarly, apart from not reproducing the non-cladistic linkages:New Guinea World – Guhu-Oro *Guhu–Oro Guhu-Samane Oro *Binandere *Yekora *Ewage-Notu *Suena–Zia (= North) Suena Zia *Central Oro (= Orokaivic) Aeka Orokaiva Hunjara *Southeast Oro (= Coastal) Baruga Gaina–Korafe *Gaina *Korafe-Yegha Demographics Smallhorn (2011:3) provides population figures for the following Binanderean languages. *Guhu-Samane: 12,800 *Suena: 3,000 *Yekora: 1,000 *Zia: 3,000 *Mawae: 943 *Binandere: 7,000 (including Ambasi) *Aeka: 3,400 *Orokaiva: 24,000 *Hunjara: 8,770 *Notu: 12,900 (including Yega) *Gaena: 1,410 *Baruga: 2,230 *Doghoro: 270 *Korafe: 3,630 ;Total: about 80,000 Pronouns Ross (2005) reconstructs both independent pronouns and verbal person prefixes: :{!sg.!!PN!!prefix - !1 *na*a- - !2 *ni*i- - !3 *nu*u- } Only 1sg continues the TNG set.

He was burned at the stake as a heretic in April 1529 for refusing to recant his beliefs. Louis de Berquin (left) released from prison by John de la Barre Life and work Berquin was born of noble family around 1490 in Vieux-Berquin. Coming into contact with Christian humanists such as Erasmus and Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples he began to study the Bible for himself and to advocate reform of the French Catholic Church from within.Baird, Henry Martyn. The Rise of the Huguenots, Vol. 1 (of 2). He desired to free France from the power of the pope. His writings aroused fierce opposition among traditional scholars. However, King Francis I and his sister Marguerite of Valois intervened in his behalf. Guizot, M. Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, trans. Robert Black. Boston: Estes & Lauriat, ca. 1869. Marguerite especially defended him, writing to the constable, Anne de Montmorency after Berquin was released from one arrest, \\"I thank you for the pleasure you have afforded me in the matter of poor Berquin whom I esteem as much as if he were myself; and so you may say you have delivered me from prison, since I consider in that light the favor done me.\\"Thieme, Hugo P. Women of Modern France. Philadelphia: Rittenhouse Press, 1907. In a letter to Erasmus, Berquin accused the divinity professors of Sorbonne of impiety. On 16 April 1529 the French Parliament condemned him to watch as his books were burned, to have his tongue pierced, and then to be imprisoned without reading material for life. When Berquin refused, even by silence, to condone the condemnation of truth, he was returned to prison. The next day, 17 April 1529, he was brought out and burned at the stake.http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc02/htm/iv.v.xv.htm All his original works are lost, only a few of his Erasmus translations remain. A Protestant controversialist has written: :Louis de Berquin was of noble birth. A brave and courtly knight, he was devoted to study, polished in manners, and of blameless morals. 'He was,' says a writer, 'a great follower of the papistical constitutions, and a great hearer of masses and sermons;... and he crowned all his other virtues by holding Lutheranism in special abhorrence.' But, like so many others, providentially guided to the Bible, he was amazed to find there 'not the doctrines of Rome, but the doctrines of Luther.' Henceforth he gave himself with entire devotion to the cause of the gospel. White, Ellen G. \\"The French Reformation\\", In The Great Controversy, 215.3.

Page 26. Domjanić was born in Krči, a village near the town of Sveti Ivan Zelina. Having graduated law, he served as a judge in Zagreb and as a counsellor for Ban's Bench. He was a member of Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, the president of Matica hrvatska (1921–1926), and the president of Yugoslav PEN Club. In a struggle between the \\"old\\" and the \\"young\\" in the framework of Croatian Modernism, he sides with the \\"young\\". He versified motifs such as spiritual love, intimacy of the nobility mansions, marquises and cavaliers of the past days. He fears the brutality of the present, mourns the world dying off, he is incredulous of new ideas. His affection for the past directs him towards his mother tongue - Kajkavian. The most notable work of Domjanić is thus Kajkavian poem collection Kipci i popevke, and the poems \\"Fala\\" and \\"Popevke sam slagal\\", both set to music by Vlaho Paljetak. Croatian composer Ivana Lang has in a similar manner set to music several Domjanić's poems. His lyrical expression, idyllic and sentimental, abounds both by the picturesqueness and musicality. He became the first writer in Croatian literature to achieve complete and artistically mature melodiousness and rhythmicity of the Croatian Kajkavian expression. All of his poems were written in Kajkavian literary language, although his vernacular was Kajkavian dialect of Adamovec. He also wrote a number of literary accounts, and a few prosaic notes, chiefly in the spirit of his lyrical interests and stylistic manière.

The San Antonio River Authority (SARA), created in 1937, is one of many such active river authorities in the State of Texas. Its jurisdiction covers 3,658 square miles—all of Bexar, Wilson, Karnes and Goliad Counties. A 12-member Board of Directors governs SARA. Six directors are elected from Bexar County and two are elected from each of the three other counties with each elected member serving six years. Policies established by the Board are executed by the management organization under the direction of a General Manager appointed by the Board.

He was later a civil servant at HM Treasury. He left his lavishly decorated South London terraced house, 575 Wandsworth Road to the National Trust.Obituary, The Times, 24 June 2006 Early life Asalache was born in Kaimosi in western Kenya, the eldest child of the local chief. In his youth, he read Shakespeare while herding cattle. He was educated at Mang'u High School, run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, where he was given the Christian name Nathaniel, and then studied architecture at the Royal Technical College in Nairobi (later to become the University of Nairobi). After studying fine art in Rome, Geneva and Vienna, he moved to London in 1960, where he taught Swahili at the Berlitz School, and worked for the BBC African Service. Though with great intellectual talent, Asalache was humble and down-to-earth. Whenever he visited his rural community in Kenya, he would freely mix with the community members and look out for a number of his youth friends. Writing career He was a pioneer of modern Kenyan literature in English.The man and the house, The National Trust His first novel, The Calabash of Life, published in 1967, focused on Kenyan tribesmen opposing a usurper and quickly became an international success. He also wrote and produced an episode of the BBC series Danger Man. Extracts from his second novel, The Latecomer, with animal characters, were broadcast by the BBC African Service in January 1971. He also wrote poetry which was published in literary journals. A collection of his poems, Sunset in Naivasha, was published by Eothen Books in 1973. His poem \\"Death of a Chief\\" was included in the Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry in 1995. Asalache received an MPhil in philosophy of mathematics from Birkbeck College in the 1970s, and became a civil servant at the Treasury. 575 Wandsworth Road Buying a modest \\"two-up two-down\\" Georgian terraced house in Wandsworth Road in 1981, Asalache paid less than the asking price of £31,000.National Trust look for £4m to preserve Khadambi Asalache's house, The Guardian, 20 January 2009 575 Wandsworth Road was in Lambeth on the number 77 bus route, allowing him to commute almost direct to his workplace.

It lasted much longer than most, serving communities from the shore of Lake Ontario to the center of western Pennsylvania. Purpose The proposed BR&P; route in 1907. Share of the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway Company, issued 15. October 1887 By the middle of the 19th century, American industry had found the means of both utilizing the bituminous coal of western Pennsylvania and transporting it economically from the mines to those who needed it.That is to say, the technology had been proved. It had not yet been implemented. Initially, this meant steam power, in both the railroad locomotives and the factories. The immediate consequence was the need for a railroad line to haul coal from the hills of Pennsylvania to the cities of Rochester and Buffalo as well as the smaller towns and villages. The needs of the latter motivated them to invest, both individually and municipally, in the new rail companies that arose almost as profusely as spring flowers. In the simplest terms, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway was required to pick up precisely what the Rochester and State Line Railroad and the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad had dropped, the coal-hauling market between the coalfields of western Pennsylvania and the cities of Buffalo and Rochester. The mines produced steam coal, and the factories and the railroads of the Northeast needed it, in vast amounts. The reality, however, was far less simple. The great need of the coal- transportation market attracted aggressive competitors, and the laissez-faire environment of the day encouraged tactics that included paper railroads, buying and selling of corporations as though they were used cars, and financial manipulation by syndicates of investors. For Buffalo, existing coal transportation was limited to lake boats; for Rochester, the canals and the east-west railroads. These bottlenecks caused fuel shortages which, in turn, led to the development of such paper railroads as the Buffalo and Pittsburgh RailroadThis road was organized in 1852 and is not related to the present company of the same name. as well as the Attica and Allegheny Valley,Along with many other planned railroads, this one was not built. The Arcade and Attica Railroad now occupies the northern part of the proposed route. in the same year. The Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad was another scheme, although this one was actually built, to a degree. In Rochester, both the seasonality of the Erie CanalIn winter, coal prices would rise significantly. and the near monopoly of the Erie RailroadThis was blamed for the price of coal tripling during the mid-1860s. intensified the pressure for a new railroad running through to the coalfields. Another failed attempt to resolve this saw the also-never-built Rochester and PittsburghNot the company of the same name which was organized in 1881. in 1853. Another line which was partially built but never reached Pennsylvania was the three-foot-gauge Rochester, Nunda, and Pennsylvania.This line operated between Mt Morris and Swain, with at least a graded railbed as far as Angelica.The name of this town is pronounced \\"nun-day\\". By 1869, much money had been spent, most of it to no good purpose, and many words had been uttered and printed, but there was still no efficient, reliable, all-weather route for the coal. Genesis With the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, the BR&P; operated the lake ferry, Ontario I, seen here docked at Charlotte, circa 1907 Although probably mythical, there's a story that the Mumford merchant, Oliver Allen, arose from a dinner with some fellow businessmen at which the need for a new railroad had been the topic of a spirited discussion and exclaimed, \\"Let's build a railroad.\\" Allen did not build the road himself, but his was the drive that led to the Rochester and State Line Railroad. The Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad Company was born on 29 January 1881 from the remains of the R&SL.; The latter had been sold on 20 January for $600,000 to a New York syndicate of investors led by Walston H Brown. Brown, of Brown, Howard, and Company, had experience in railroad building; his company typified the many financial speculators and investment organizations which dealt in railroad companies and their securities. Another investment company to figure prominently in the BR&P; history was that of Adrian Iselin. Ab initio, these investors planned expansion into the lucrative coal-haulage market. The source of the coal had by this time expanded south through western Pennsylvania into the Beech Tree area between Brockwayville and DuBois. In a practice typical in the industry, so-called \\"construction companies\\" were formed. They were paper railroadsWhile some of them never got off the paper, as it were, others did actual building before their intentionally brief lives ended. intended for the actual building of new lines and branches but not permanent existence operating them. Thus, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad Company, the Great Valley and Bradford Railroad, the Bradford and State Line Railroad, and the Pittsburgh and New York Railroad built their respective lines, and then the latter three companies were folded back into the Rochester and Pittsburgh in November 1881. The R&P; purchased the Pitkin Building on Main Street West and Oak Street in Rochester and added a two-story Gothic structure to it. The board then hired a highly qualified manager in George E Merchant, who had excelled as a division superintendent for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St Paul, and Pacific. Among the issues he faced upon beginning work in the head office in Rochester were several pending lawsuits against the R&SL; and disputes arising from the shady land acquisition practices of the company's forebear.The Rochester and State Line Railroad had, in some instances, built their tracks across land that they did not yet own. Resolving these, he proceeded to improve the capital plant, including refurbishing the older locomotives and buying new ones. He bought more 4-4-0 Brooks engines, as well as a number of 2-8-0 Consolidations. Line construction absorbed considerable resources as well.In an incident in 1882, the R&P; built a line across the narrow-gauge Olean, Bradford, and Warren without first asking permission. When the OB&W; declined the R&P;'s terms for an agreement, the R&P; went ahead with the construction anyway. The irate OB&W; crew then hooked a locomotive to the trestle works and started to pull it down. Intervention by the local police kept the resulting brawl from becoming serious. The two companies eventually came to an agreement at least non-violent if not altogether amicable. In 1882, through its subsidiary, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad, it extended its trackage south from Salamanca to reach the coal fields of Pennsylvania. To accomplish this required bridging the Kinzua Creek Gorge. The R&P; used what was, for the time, the world's highest railroad bridge. Built by the New York, Lake Erie, and Western Railroad and Coal Company, the structure was more than above the creek and more than long. Construction took only ninety-four days. The single track over the bridge was shared by the Erie and the R&P; this proved to be a bottleneck, and the company which succeeded the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad Company, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, built a forty-mile detour, opening it in 1893. While the R&P; was expanding on its south side, it also built on the north end. Using the Rochester and Charlotte,Technically, this company never built anything. Organized on 21 April 1881 for the purpose of constructing a line from the R&P; at Lincoln Park to the lake at Charlotte (the mouth of the Genesee River), it instead abandoned its proposed route in a deal struck with the New York Central and Hudson River on 1 May 1882 and extended to May 1886, by which time, of course, the R&P; had disappeared. The BR&P; did build this route, using the Lincoln Park and Charlotte Railroad. the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh,Its point of departure from the R&P; main line was a spot in the town of Ashford. It was created on 18 August 1881 by the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad for the purpose of extending its line north from Machias to Buffalo. In the event, this route started not at Machias but at Ashford, the result of which was Ashford Junction. On 28 September 1881, this company and the paper-only Rochester and Charlotte Railroad were merged into the Rochester and Pittsburgh. and the Perry RailroadA modest undertaking organized on 9 May 1882 to build a one mile (1.6 km) long connection between the existing short line at Silver Springs and the R&P; main line at Silver Lake Junction, the Perry Railroad was taken back into the R&P; on 17 November 1883. as construction companies, it brought much greater capability to the old RS&L; yard at Lincoln Park and extended its line to the coal pier on the Genesee River at Lake Ontario (Charlotte). Succumbing to over-expansion,The railroad historian, Paul Pietrak, suggests(page 35) that the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad Company was, in essence, nothing more than a vast construction company for the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway. the R&P; went bankrupt in May 1885 after existing less than four years.20 January 1881 through 16 October 1885. The vigorous expansion of the railroad, including land acquisition, the employment of literally thousands of laborers, and the purchase of locomotives and freight and passenger cars, placed upon the Rochester and Pittsburgh a burden that its revenue and capitalization could not sustain. On 30 May 1885, the Supreme Court appointed a referee to whom it gave the authority to sell off the company's assets. The foreclosure had been forced by the Union Trust Company of New York City. On 16 October 1885, Adrian Iselin bought the remains of the R&P.; That October, it emerged in the form of a new company called the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, a name which accurately reflected the physical reality of its route structure. One of the forces at work in the reorganization which engendered the BR&P; was a Rochester coal merchant named Arthur Yates. Not coincidentally, Yates was the line's biggest coal shipper.

Eleven miles long between Clarion Junction and J&B; Junction (at 2,216 ft), it rises northbound at to the mile. the BR&P; ran engines that were well maintained and in which crews took justifiable pride. By the time the Rochester and Pittsburgh had inherited the R&SL; motive power, the original eleven had aged quickly, the RS&L; having spent little on maintenance. The R&P; had to send the locomotives back to Brooks for rebuilding in 1881. By the end of 1881, the company had a total of sixteen locomotives, all of them Brooks 4-4-0s. With the advent of the R&P; came expansion into the hills of Pennsylvania, and that meant heavier and more powerful engines. In 1881, five Consolidation 2-8-0s were added to the roster, with another fifteen early in 1882. In 1883, another fifteen were acquired, along with four more 4-4-0s. The next type procured was the 0-6-0 switcher, as well as more Consolidations. By 1884, the R&P; was operating 60 engines, and this represented the extent of the R&P;'s locomotive inventory. From the inception of the BR&P;, the company purchased locomotives as the need for them arose and then maintained them well. Some of these engines were used for both passenger and freight service, but many fell into one category or the other. Since the BR&P; came to an end in 1932, it remained a steam-only railroad, with some of its locomotives serving the B&O; through the 1950s. =Freight engines= While the BR&P; simply purchased the great majority of its locomotives, several were acquired by means of leases when the company faced a serious but temporary shortfall, while others came to the BR&P; through subsidiary companies, such as the Allegheny and Western Railroad, the Silver Lake Railway,The two locomotives acquired when this road was absorbed in 1910 promptly disappeared from the historical record. The presumption is that they were taken to Lincoln Park and sold, but it is unknown where they went. the Rural Valley Railroad, and the Clearfield and Mahoning. Although the first engines were all Brooks, that shop's inability to keep up with demand led to the first BR&P; purchase being made at Baldwin Locomotive Works. Hauling coal was the company's trade, and coal cars are heavy. Some of the consists at the time ranged from 2,175 tons to 3,700 tons. The semi-mountainous terrain of western Pennsylvania demanded enormous pulling (and pushing) capability, and even the 250-ton 2-6-6-2s were often doubled up. =Passenger engines= Although the BR&P; was not a passenger line, it put a first-class effort into the passenger service that it provided the public. The locomotives used represented the best available, as did the care given these engines, leading to an enviable record for on-time completion of trips. The first passenger service was hauled by special Brooks 4-6-0 engines acquired in 1898 and dedicated to passenger trains. Larger than the then-standard 4-4-0 Brooks, these engines were the pride of the company. In 1901, they were supplanted by the more-capable 4-4-2 Atlantics. The last of these came on board in 1909. The Atlantic class was fastThe mechanical nature of a steam locomotive makes it increasingly susceptible to breakdown as its operating speed is increased. and capable when coupled to a three-car train. As train length was increased and heavier steel cars replaced the wood cars, the Atlantics were, in turn, replaced by the heavier 4-6-2 Pacifics, which lasted until the B&O; ended passenger service in 1955. The BR&P; owned a total of 22 Pacifics, acquisition ranging from 1912 to 1923. Used widely by railroads throughout the country, it proved popular and reliable. The Pacific was built in several weights, with the lighter numbers 675 to 679 Brooks engines known by the crews as the \\"sport model\\".

Image:Mumford Train Station Today.jpgToday, the train station in Mumford is an herb store. The public face of a railroad is its stations, and the BR&P; demonstrated its respect for its customers with well-designed, well- built, and well-maintained railway stations, most of which outlasted the company. Some were erected anew, while others, like the terminus in Rochester, were improvements of existing buildings. The original Scottsville station of the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh sat at the west end of Maple Street,This street had been built in the 1870s in order to make the train station accessible from Browns Avenue. well to the north of the end of the road. Its 1911 replacement was on the curve where Maple turns south to Wyvil and Hanford. The railroad built a new station in Scottsville, formally dedicating it in 1911. Sitting approximately one hundred meters south of the original building, it was introduced to the public in a modest ceremony featuring Surrogate Judge Selden S Brown and businessman David Salyerds. In the summer of 1911, the line started a new station on the west side of Main Street in Mumford, completing it in October 1912. Over seven hundred people attended the opening, including Judge Brown again. This station, on the very south side of Wheatland, accommodated both Mumford and Caledonia. The Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh stations in Springville, New York and Orchard Park, New York were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 and 2007, respectively. The Rochester station at 320 Main Street West survives today...as Nick Tahou's. That part of Oak Street which ended at the station on Main Street disappeared when the I-490 expressway and Frontier Field were built. The track behind the station, however, survives as part of the Rochester and Southern, whose parent company, the Genesee and Wyoming, purchased the Rochester to Ashford Junction portion of the former BR&P; in 1986. The Bradford station saw enormous activity at the end of the 19th century. The BR&P; had a maintenance facility in this oil town, along with their cross-tie and timber factory, which operated its own two-foot-gauge micro-railroad for moving the timbers about. Other railroads active in Bradford at the time included the Bradford, Bordell, and Kinzua, the Olean, Bradford, and Warren, the Kindell and Eldred, and the bizarre little Bradford and Foster Brook Monorail. At the time, the BR&P; averaged some fifty freight crews operating out of Bradford, with the Erie, Pennsylvania, and short lines contributing their share. Operation =Coal= Genesee Coal Dock, looking north along the river toward Lake Ontario The Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway was a company built on and around taking coal north out of Pennsylvania. The financial backer of the newly founded Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad, the banking house of Adrian Iselin, owned not only an interest in the rail line but coal mines and coke processing facilities. The Iselin presence at the southern end of the BR&P; was such that today's maps of the coal mining region show such place names as Adrian, Adrian Furnace, Adrian Mines, and Iselin Heights; moreover, the railroad named one entire branch after him. Iselin's intentionHis first land purchase in 1881 included of the \\"very best bituminous coal lands in Pennsylvania,\\" according to the coal company's first annual report. was to ship 2000 tons of coal daily, to which end Iselin and the railroad established the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company, entirely owned by the R&P.; Walston H Brown was president of both corporations. The company town at the southern end of the railroad, in the acquired by the coal company in the Punxsutawney area, was given the name Walston, Pennsylvania.Apparently, the corporate charters of the day did not have mandatory modesty provisions. The initial coal production facilities yielded approximately six hundred tons daily, at a total mine-to-carload cost of seventy-three cents per ton. The first coal to be shipped on the R&P; went to the Rochester coal merchant, Arthur G Yates. Such was the demand for coal that the coal shipments began well before track construction had been completed, leading to constant conflict in scheduling. By 1886, the railroad had some 4,182 freight cars, and 3,028 of them were coal cars. Of those, perhaps 500 belonged to the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company. By the mid-1880s, the railroad was running forty or more coal trains a day. Since coke was a valuable commodity, the coal company built a mile and a quarter long string of 475 coke furnaces, the largest in the world at the time, producing 22,000 tons a month, some of which was shipped out by train. Much of the coke, however, was consumed on-site in refining the iron ore brought in by lakes freighter and trans-shipped to the iron mills by the coal trains on their way back south. Two coal companies accounted for the coal trade carried by the railroad. At first competitors, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company and the Bell, Lewis, and Yates Coal Mining Company became very good friends when Frederick Bell, George Lewis, and Arthur Yates took seats on the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway board of directors. In fact, with Iselin's resignation as president of the railway company, Yates took his place. The two coal companies then negotiated an agreement which eased competitive pressures and allocated access to the railroad's coal-transporting capacity. While Yates concentrated on coal, Merchant ran the railroad. Part of Yates' contribution to the BR&P;'s ability to haul coal was the extension of the line north from Lincoln Park through Rochester up to the coal dock it built at the mouth of the Genesee River in 1896. With an initial capacity of 4,000 tons a day, it was expanded in 1909 and 1913. To get coal to Canada, the BR&P; arranged a cross-lake ferry service with the Grand Trunk Railway. This service was highly successful, carrying passengers and coal cars to Cobourg and other lake destinations.Rochester residents will be entertained to learn that precedent exists for a successful Rochester-to-Ontario ferry operation. By 1913, over a million tons of coal a year passed through the Rochester coal dock. As the national economy grew, more and more coal mines were developed along the BR&P; routes. In fact, the new Indiana Branch soon yielded the greatest traffic volume as mines opened in the area south of Punxsutawney. By the 1920s, coal trains averaged 3,750 tons,This was tame when compared to the world record, an Australian ore train claiming a mass of over 100,000 short tons, or when compared to the 10 to 20 kiloton coal trains hauled by the steam engines in Appalachia (cite not available). requiring considerably better motive power than the archaic Consolidations of the earlier era. However, long coal drags with one or two Mallets at the head did not last forever. In the first quarter of the new century, the market share held by the comparatively costly union-made coal of Pennsylvania was driven down by the cheaper coal from the non-union mines of Kentucky and West Virginia. The companies of the Pittsburgh Coal District sought federal regulation of coal industry wages but lost. In a series of moves to protect themselves, the coal companies transferred to the BR&P; not only the short-line railroads they'd built themselves but also the Genesee Coal Dock facility. This had the effect of improving the coal companies' fiscal performance, but it effectively hung an anchor on the railroad's neck as it swam in deeper and deeper waters. The headquarters of both the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway and the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company were in the elegant building on Main Street West in Rochester, and the bitter arguments between William Noonan, the head of the railway, and L W Robinson, the head of the coal company, became the stuff of local legend. In the end, both companies lost. The railroad disappeared into the B&O;, and the coal company, which survived at least until 1981 in dramatically reduced size, is today no longer to be found in Rochester. =Passenger service= Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway timetable from 4 June 1893 The Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway thrived on the haulage of heavy freight, primarily Pennsylvania coal, but its passenger service was characterized as \\"second to none\\". The first passenger run took place on the Rochester and State Line Railroad on its 15 September 1874 run from Rochester to Le Roy. The last was on 15 October 1955, when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ended its Buffalo - Pittsburgh service. At the start of the 20th century, the BR&P; inaugurated a through service connecting Rochester and Pittsburgh. The first run of the Pittsburgh Mail and Express left Rochester at precisely 0900 on 10 October 1899, bound for Pittsburgh, to the south. The night departure was called the Pittsburgh Night Express. The return trips were the Buffalo Rochester Mail and Express and the Buffalo Rochester Night Express. These later became the Great Lakes Express and the Pittsburgh Flyer. The company took pride in doing its job properly.A comparison between the BR&P;'s record of passenger service and that of today's passenger rail service would serve little purpose. In its report for the year ending 30 June 1915, the New York State Public Service Commission observed that the BR&P; had operated 13,877 passenger runs. Of these, 12,628 were on time. The average delay was two minutes. Commuter rail service on the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania connected outlying towns and villages to Rochester. In some areas, Darwinian competition resulted in the failure of other rail lines, e.g. the Springville and Sardinia Railroad. =Pushers and helpers= Early freight operations consisted of trains of fewer than twenty cars, for the cars were weak and the locomotives small. The hilly terrain over which the BR&P; routes ran posed problems, especially in the days before steel rolling stock. To negotiate these grades, the railroad needed to use helpers and pushers. If the second (or third) engine were put at the head of the train, then too much weight aft might result in a broken coupler and the lethal problem of a runaway. If the additional power were at the back end, then the soft wood cars tended to buckle under the compression. Occasionally, a compromise would put the helper locomotive at or near the center of the train. Using helpers brought an additional problem. Since these engines were needed only on steeper grades and since the railroad would never countenance the expense of a second engine and crew on the entire run, the helpers had to return to the bottom of the grade for the next heavy train needing a push. At first, this meant running backward after uncoupling from the rear of the train. The BR&P; discouraged backward running as bad practice,Company policy demanded full water tanks when running backward; this discouraged light tenders from jumping the rails. The crews, too, disliked the practice, since it meant very cold rides in winter, the back curtain needing to be left open for visibility. a problem that eventually was solved with the construction of wyes for turning around. Additionally, care had to be exercised to avoid placing a caboose between a pusher and a train, as this crushed the soft cabooses. One practice not encouraged by management was disconnecting helper locomotivesThe pusher was at the rear of the train; the helper was at the front. on the fly. The engineer of the helper would back off on the throttle to unload the coupler, and the fireman would pull the pin to separate the two engines. The helper would then sprint ahead to the siding, throw the switch, pull off the line, and reset the switch, preferably all before the train arrived at the turnout. The BR&P; had four divisions, and helpers/pushers were used on all of them. The real difference arose because of the preponderance of heavy loads running northbound. For instance, coal trains were loaded northbound and empty southbound, as were the oil tankers. However, prior to World War I, the BR&P; ran ore trains from Buffalo south to the iron mills in DuBois.These belonged to the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company, affiliated with the BR&P.; The steepest grades were in the Buffalo Division, but they were uphill southbound and thus not a problem for the coal trains northbound. The ore trains had to negotiate these grades uphill, and, in the days before the Mallets, the ore trains out of Buffalo Creek had two Consolidations at the front and three at the rear. The Clarion Hill grade of the Middle Division, while not the steepest, did pose the greatest challenges. The worst grades on the BR&P; were in the 84 to per mile range. In later years, when wood freight cars had long been forgotten, helpers and pushers remained, although in the form of much larger, heavier, more powerful locomotives assisting far heavier trains. The BR&P; operated two 700 seriesAs well as the 800 series, two of which were kept at Clarion Junction for pushing BR&P; and Erie trains over Clarion Hill. of Mallets: the comparatively light 700 through 741 and the heavier 742 through 754. Since they differed in frame design, this meant that the weaker 8th century were never doubled together.The BR&P; Department of Motive Power feared that running two of these in tandem incurred the risk of bending the frame. Instead, a light 700 would be coupled ahead of the heavier one for a double. When two 700 series Mallets were pushing, the same constraint was applied. If the run utilized two light Mallets, then the second one was placed at the rear, ahead of the caboose, and pushed. One more issue with doubled Mallets was whether or not all the bridges on the run were strong enough for two of the 9th century or the heavy 8th century running together. With the mass and power of locomotives like the Mallets, care had to be exercised in their operation. A light Mallet used as a pusher naturally connected to the train with its front coupler, and the strength of this drawhead was not infinite. While the engine could not push hard enough to break the drawhead, the engineer needed to avoid slack. On the downhill part of one run one day on the Buffalo Division from Beaver to Hoyts, the pusher engineer did not keep up with the train ahead and saw it pull away from him with his drawhead hanging from the last car.The physics is simple: the three thousand tons of the train rolling downhill at an accelerating speed generated an enormous pulling force, while the inertia of the 250 ton locomotive created a powerful resistance to acceleration, the consequence of which was the failure of the hardware securing the front coupler. Sometimes, the problems with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but the politics and the economics. In the 1880s, the BR&P; and the Erie shared locomotive facilities at Clarion Junction. They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service to each other on the basis of whose engine was first up at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push. After some years of this, the BR&P; management realized that their engines were doing most of the work. The Erie crews had acquired the knack of finding something wrong with their engines, keeping them conveniently immobilized when it was time for work. The agreement ended. A Mikado locomotive of the Baltimore and Ohio Both roads faced the same problems at Clarion Junction: how best to get heavy trains over Clarion Hill. By the end of the 19th century, the Erie kept two engines there, while the BR&P; had up to five. Initially, they used 2-8-0 Consolidations, but the limitations of these antiquated locomotives forced adoption of specialized engines, such as the 4-8-0 Mastodon in 1896. This did not suffice, leading to the heavier Y Class 2-10-0 Decapod in 1907. The increased traffic of WW I led to the solution, the XX Class 2-8-8-2 Mallets. The BR&P; bought these engines in 1918 essentially for one purpose, to \\"push Clarion Hill off the map\\". These locomotives were well suited to the task, as they were slow and capable of massive drawbar traction. The cooperation between the BR&P; and the Erie ended in 1928, when the Erie made sweeping improvements, including introduction of 2-8-4 Berkshires and 2-8-2 Mikados, making the BR&P; helpers/pushers superfluous to requirements. On some runs, the Erie put two engines at the head of the train and a third at the rear. This saved as much as ten to twelve minutes on the hill and enabled longer consists. Since the third engine, the pusher, was lighter than the BR&P; Mallet, it could push against the caboose rather than needing to be placed ahead of it, making it much easier and faster to detach from the train. In the days before radio, dispatching locomotives involved using whatever means of communication were available. The BR&P; maintained a helper station at a siding between Dellwood and Lanes Mills, south of Brockwayville. The 700 series Mallets stationed here were required to assist coal trains up to McMinn Summit. When this was necessary, the dispatcher would call the crew to work by ringing a phone booth located next to the siding. A loud bell generally sufficed to wake up the engine crew. On those occasions when it did not, the dispatcher would call the McMinn farm nearby, and one of the McMinn children would run over to the siding to awaken the engineer and fireman. =Maintenance facilities= Steam locomotives imposed enormous maintenance burdens on the railroads. Primitive in design, they contained numerous self- destructive moving parts which were manufactured using, by contemporary standards, exceptionally primitive techniques.Sometimes, welding consisted of nothing more than heating the ends of the two parts to incandescence and then hammering them until they became a single piece. This is part of the reason why steam locomotive parts failed catastrophically. In fact, a number of railroads were capable of making their own locomotives and cars, and did so. When the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad took over the facilities of the Rochester and State Line Railroad, it acquired little in the way of usable maintenance assets. To remedy this deficiency, the R&P; bought land in the Lincoln Park section of Rochester and, in 1881, built a machine shop for repair work. In 1882, they erected a roundhouse, today at the corner of West Avenue and Buffalo Road. (The turntable has been preserved by the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum in Rush, NY, while the building itself has been converted for use by a scrap company.) This facility, with its fourteen-stall enginehouse, was the central shop for the entire line. The other end of the line (at the time) was in Salamanca, where the company built a smaller facility, including a two-stall enginehouse, a turntable, and the Ramsey Transfer mechanism needed for interchange with the Erie.When the Erie adopted the standard gauge, this was removed. Additional facilities were installed at Perry and Gainesville in the 1880s, along with more at Ashford Junction and Clarion Junction. Since railroad shops meant employment, small towns vied aggressively to convince the railroads to build facilities in their taxing jurisdictions. Bradford, for instance, gave the R&P; of land and an eight thousand dollar grant for construction. The investment by the town paid off: the R&P; set up a roundhouse and turntable, a machine shop, a car repair shop, as well as coaling and watering facilities. In the 1880s, the line to Buffalo was built, terminating at Buffalo Creek. A more modest shop was established here, including a seventy-foot turntable that had to be enlarged to one hundred five feet to accommodate the Mallets. There were only two ways to turn a locomotive around, and the wye alternative was very costly in terms of land area. Thus, Buffalo Creek had one of only two BR&P; turntablesThe other was at Rikers. capable of swinging a Mallet engine. On the rare occasion of a Mallet reaching Rochester, it had to be turned on a wye. The Mallet would fit into only a single stall of the Lincoln Park roundhouse; even then, it stuck out considerably in the back, so the railroad built an extension to the stall to enable the doors to be closed. The Buffalo Creek roundhouse lacked this refinement. When two Mallets were parked in it, their tenders not only stuck out but very nearly touched. To deal with this, the BR&P; built the \\"Malley House\\" near the roundhouse; it accommodated two of the ninety-two-foot wheelbase engines. The BR&P;, having grown considerably, needed still more. The mine branches in the Punxsutawney area imposed their own burden on the BR&P; repair capabilities, and shops were built at Elk Run, just to the north. However, the company needed a major facility at which the biggest repairs could be done; at the time (1880s), the most serious work on locomotives required sending the engines back to their builders in Dunkirk and Rome. To resolve this, the BR&P; selected DuBois as the location of their primary maintenance plant. The archetypal railroad town, DuBois had its first BR&P; facility in 1886, with the car repair shop. The locomotive repair shop grew from a six-stall roundhouse at Valley and Jared Streets. When DuBois granted the railroad land and money, the expansion hit high gear. By the early 20th century, the railroad had sufficient capability at DuBois to handle everything, including building a locomotive from scratch. The BR&P; could now cycle engines through the shop on a regular basis, thus keeping their motive power available and reliable. This expansion did not occur at the expense of other sites. East Salamanca was chosen in 1906 for a new roundhouse, enginehouse, and classification yard, thanks to a location convenient to the Buffalo, Middle, and Rochester Divisions. The introduction of the huge Class XX 2-8-8-2 Mallets in 1918 necessitated construction of appropriate shop facilities at East Salamanca. This included electric jacks that could lift the Mallet off the ground. Among the other annoyances that management had to face, one peculiar to steam locomotive operation plagued the BR&P.; In addition to the accidents resulting from employee carelessness, in which doors and walls were destroyed by the impacts of engines that weren't stopped in time, the engines themselves were prone to go walkabout if left idling with a head of steam. A worn valve might pass sufficient steam to enable the locomotive to go through a roundhouse wall or door, drive into a turntable pit, or amble down the rail line, all on its own. In April 1930, sparks from a crane ignited the roof of the older roundhouse at DuBois; the fire put the building out of operation 'til autumn, and the eleven locomotives inside suffered considerable damage. Accidents Image:Sloppey work.jpgThis train hit an improperly set switch in the East Salamanca yard on the evening of 16 Oct 1917. The toll was one locomotive on its side, thirteen cars tumbled into a mess, of which two were destroyed, and one engineer in the hospital with a wrenched back. Image:Tree VersusTrain.jpgOn 8 June 1906, a severe storm felled an elm tree, dropping it on the BR&P; tracks one mile (1.6 km) north of Pavilion. The freight train was unable to slow from its fifty-mile per hour speed before striking the tree. Both locomotives were thrown from the track, and several crew were killed. Image:I Get a Bang Out of You.jpgThe explosion of a car carrying dynamite in Ridgway, Pennsylvania on 4 November 1906 left the crew of the train uninjured but reduced fifteen freight cars to rubble, as well as accounting for an untold number of neighborhood windows. Image:What Happens When Brakes Fail.jpgThe failure of the brakes on a coal train headed downhill plus the presence of another train headed in the opposite direction near Silver Springs Junction added up to one fatality and forty wrecked freight cars. The estimated cost was a quarter of a million dollars, in the days when the typical wreck's cost was a few thousand. Image:Mess at Mumford.jpgMinor injuries and nineteen wrecked cars resulted from this rear-end collision at Mumford on 21 August 1911. File:East Salamanca Yard's Bridge, Great Valley Creek Collapse.jpgWhen the south abutment of the East Salamanca yard's bridge across the Great Valley Creek failed on 20 September 1912, half of the bridge dropped, and so did the train on it. (See text below.) Image:Kissy kissy.jpgTwo 700-series Mallets shared improper intimacies on 12 September 1920 in East Bradford when one engineer somehow failed to see and hear emergency signals and flares. The collision caused very minor injuries to two of the crew of number 716. Image:Mallets kissing.jpgMallet locomotives 716 and 729 on the southbound track after the twenty mile per hour collision. A conductor had just stepped out of a trackside phone booth when the train hit it. A passing train was just barely caught before it would have hit the wreckage. Railroads are required not to have accidents, but the historical record shows that they occasionally do. Most accidents are deadly serious, with mere destruction of property if those involved are fortunate and death and injury if they are not. The R&P; operated in the days of looser and more tolerant labor practices. In the winter of 1881, the engineer of a southbound oil train approaching the bridge north of Ellicottville stopped upon observing the \\"settled and bent condition\\" of the bridge ahead of him. A mail train from Rochester slowed to a stop behind him as he awaited instructions. The conductor of the second train ordered the first engineer to take his engine across to \\"test\\" the bridge. The engineer and his locomotive survived the transit, but the bridge settled several inches. While the conductor tried to talk the mail train engineer into shoving the oil cars across the bridge, the ice in the current carried away one of the bridge supports. Time for Plan B. The conductor walked across the bridge and rode the first engine into Ellicottville, where he picked up a boxcar and returned for the mail and passengers. They walked across the bridge and arrived in Salamanca in time to make their connections. It was less amusing one Sunday morning in July 1883 when an R&P; coal train broke in two on a grade of per mile at Rasselas, twenty-five miles south of Bradford. A not altogether atypical occurrence in the days before reliable couplers, this resulted in seven loaded coal cars and a single passenger car with fifteen to twenty people aboard accelerating back down the grade out of control. The investigation that followed alleged that the conductor and brakeman were both asleep. Neither survived. The runaway string of cars smashed into a train proceeding in the same direction. The engineer of this train saw the cars coming and, with his fireman, leapt off the locomotive after reversing it, surviving with serious bruising. Since the passenger car was the last on the first train, it hit the locomotive at full speed and was split in half. The destroyed passenger car was immediately struck by the coal cars; seven people died, and eight were injured. Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh locomotive number 801 after falling off the tracks in Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania, on 19 April 1918 Fatal car accident in Spencerport, New York, involving the BR&P; from the Rochester Herald, October 20, 1917 Even well-run railroads have accidents, and the BR&P; had its share. In the final analysis, all accidents result from someone's failure, whether in design, manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance. The company set its standards higher than most did, but the risks of railroading still took a painful toll. Some wrecks damaged locomotives and cars, tracks and buildings, and careers, but without the loss of life or the injuries that were common in the period. In late May 1893, two freight trains near Brockwayville, in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, tried to occupy one space, with predictable results: both locomotives and both trains were totally destroyed. Others had graver consequences. One night in February of that same year, a coal train and a freight train came together because of excessive speed and the inadequate brakes of the day. The newspaper accounts, more graphic than is customary today, gave a blood-chilling picture of what happens to a man crushed in the wreckage and exposed to a continuous blast of live steam. In these harrowing stories, two themes emerge. The trains ran at speeds low enough to allow the crews to leap off when disaster was imminent; and more than one engineer or brakeman remained at his position on the doomed train to the very end, often with fatal consequences. In other incidents, less noble working behavior led to accidents. In April 1908, an engineer disregarded signals at Rock Glen, leading to a high-speed head-on collision on a curve with another locomotive one mile (1.6 km) north of the station. While no passengers died, the fireman succumbed to steam scalding, dying half an hour after the crash. Criminal charges brought the engineer's arrest for manslaughter. In a more poignant incident in June 1900, engineer William Kation died in a head-on collision between two passenger trains that occurred right in front of his own home, on what was to have been his very last run before retiring. The crash resulted from a simple clerical error in the train orders for that day. Train crews are forever at the mercy of what others do. In February 1927, a Bradford yard employee left a switch in the wrong position, derailing a passenger train. The fireman was injured but survived; the engineer, who had worked for the line for forty-five years, was close to retirement, and had a reputation as a meticulous and careful worker, was crushed, scalded, and dismembered when the locomotive overturned. (See photo above) Some disasters are the fruit of errors made years before, as in bridges not built or maintained properly. In the BR&P; East Salamanca yard on 28 August 1911, a slow freight train toppled off a bridge the south abutment of which failed. The engineer saw the rails tipping slowly and yelled to the fireman to jump. He and the brakeman survived the plunge into the water, but the fireman did not. In the news reports, railroad officials expressed gratitude that the next train on the line, a passenger run, had not been the one to encounter the collapsing bridge. They also claimed that the bridge had been in good working order all along and that the high water in Great Valley Creek had done the damage. Fifteen minutes prior to the collapse, two freight trains had passed on the bridge with no hint of trouble. (See photo above.) Sometimes it was bad judgment, other times it was just bad luck: When the line acquired its Mallets in 1917, they naturally gave thought to how the weight of these machines would affect the existing trackage. Some work was done strengthening bridges and railworks, but it proved not wholly adequate. On 19 April 1918, the BR&P; ran a very heavy Mallet over a light track north of Clarion Junction near Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania. The result of the rails spreading apart under the weight of the 280 ton engine was an upside-down locomotive (see photo above). This was not a rare occurrence, as these 800-series Mallets were not only the heaviest that the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway operated, they were the heaviest ever used in normal service in the entire area. Less than two weeks earlier, number 806 had suffered the same ignominy when the railbed beneath her gave way on Clarion Hill. The crew sent to retrieve the engine simply tied a set of rails onto the locomotive's drivers and then rolled it upright onto a temporary roadbed, using three cranes. This temporary rail was then tied into the main line, enabling the number 806 to slink back home for repairs. Acquisition by B&O; Officially, the end came in 1932, when the line was absorbed into the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, giving the B&O; increased access to New York State. (They already had a toe-hold with their acquisition of the Staten Island Rapid Transit at the other end of the state.) The acquisition exemplified the endless machinations of the railroad era. For a while, the Van Sweringen brothers wanted the BR&P;, and Iselin was pleased to make the divestiture in 1928. The sale value of the company had been inflated by the contention between the Delaware and Hudson and the Baltimore and Ohio for the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, making its sale a compelling decision for Iselin. The Pennsylvania coalfields were waning, thanks to non-union mines in Kentucky and West Virginia, and the revenues from the railroad had fallen correspondingly. The D&H; wanted westward routes, and the BR&P; figured in their plans. The B&O; had routes that the Van Sweringens wanted, making a swap attractive to both companies. The ICC now regulated the railroads with a tight grip,It wanted to tie weak railroads to strong ones in order to enhance diversification and competition. and its view was that the B&O; proposal to buy the BR&P; would serve shippers better than would the D&H; plan to lease the company's lines. The B&O; agreed in March 1929 to the purchase of the BR&P; from the Alleghany Corporation, getting ICC approval in February of the following year. The deal yielded the B&O; the BR&P;, the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, and the Mt Jewett, Kinzua, and Riterville. It gave the Van Sweringens the Wheeling and Lake Erie. The formal hand-over occurred on 1 January 1932, forever ending the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway.

In its disregard for accurate representation and its rejection of conventional attitudes about art, 'bad' painting is at once funny and moving, and often scandalous in its scorn for the standards of good taste.\\" Her use of quotation marks around \\"Bad\\" points to this special meaning. \\"Bad\\" here, is thus a term of approval for the more eccentric and amusing variations on certain accepted styles, at that time. Artists Artists included in the exhibition were James Albertson (1944–2015), Joan Brown (1938–1990), Eduardo Carrillo (1937–1997), James Chatelain (b. 1947), Cply (alias William Copley) (1919–1996), Charles Garabedian (1923–2016), Cham Hendon (1936–2014), Joseph Hilton (b. 1946), Neil Jenney (b. 1945), Judith Linhares (b. 1940), P. Walter Siler (b. 1939), Earl Staley (b. 1938), Shari Urquhart (b. 1938), and William Wegman (b. 1943). Style On paper, Tucker's criterion for \\"Bad\\" Painting is rather generous, allowing merely that \\"the artists whose work will be shown have discarded classical drawing modes in order to present a humorous, often sardonic, intensely personal view of the world\\".Tucker, Marcia, Press Release, see external link for New Museum of Contemporary Art But this alone would simply permit work with Expressionist or Surrealist tendencies, not to say caricature, styles already well established within a canon of good taste. In practice though, Tucker's criterion is much stricter, and excludes for example, the established Expressionism of a Leon Golub (1922–2004) or Jack Levine (1915–2010), the caricature of a Peter Saul (b. 1934) or Philip Guston (1913–1980),Tucker, Marcia, \\"Bad\\" Painting, catalogue essay, in Albertson, James, et al, \\"Bad\\" Painting, New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, 1978. - Footnote 33. the fantasy of later Honoré Sharrer (1920–2009). Some further condition was obviously at work in her criterion. In the catalogue essay, a context of the preceding fifteen years is sketched, in which Minimalism and Photo-realism represent a prevalent \\"classicizing\\" style for American painting and against which \\"Bad\\" Painting presents a challenge (although not a movement).Tucker, Marcia, \\"Bad\\" Painting, catalogue essay, in Albertson, James, et al, \\"Bad\\" Painting, New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, 1978, Unfortunately there are no page numbers to the catalogue, so numbers offered here count from the first page of Tucker's essay (as 1) - p.3, p.17. At best, this explains the selection as a retreat from photographic or \\"classicizing\\" standards for figuration to an older style. Tucker identifies a shared theme of iconoclasm, and a preference for parody and antagonism for her selection,Tucker, Marcia, \\"Bad\\" Painting, catalogue essay, in Albertson, James, et al, \\"Bad\\" Painting, New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, 1978; p.7, p.15, p.17. but again, these are qualities common to Expressionism and Surrealism, and even some Photo-realism.Battcock, Gregory, Super Realism: A Critical Anthology, Dutton, New York, 1975 p.39. A further feature noted is the use of \\"non-high-art sources\\", the most prevalent being comics.Tucker, Marcia, \\"Bad\\" Painting, in Albertson, James, et al \\"Bad\\" Painting, New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, 1978, p.13. Yet curiously, Tucker makes no mention of Pop Art, as inspiration or opposition. High and non-high (or low) art cannot be a matter of imagery or iconography, since high-art features as much irreverence and caricature as it does realism and veneration (for example, the work of Goya or Daumier, Lautrec or Arcimboldo). Nor can the difference rest purely upon technique, since paintings may be high or low-art. Yet, comics as a source, along with other commercial illustration cited, surely separates \\"Bad\\" Painting from earlier Expressionism and Surrealism, surely picks out a crucial trait across this otherwise disparate group. Tucker's essay cannot quite put her finger on it, but one might tease this out by considering preceding developments in figurative painting in the 1960s and 70s, a little closer. While art historical allusion, humour and fantasy are undoubtedly features of her selection, more precisely, they arise in deliberately citing popular print or publication sources, albeit with increasing distance or restraint. The strand to figurative painting discerned by Tucker surely derives from the styles of Pop Art, Pattern and Decoration, The Hairy Who, and affiliated Chicago groups, and Californian Funk Art. One way of understanding \\"Bad\\" Painting is to notice how these preceding styles progressively depart from common or mass print imagery, while spelling out crucial differences between painting and prints – defining painting. In this way, they disclose telling differences in meaning between the two, even when imagery remains much the same. Tucker rightly senses this project travels in tandem with Minimalism, but without quite grasping the consequences. \\"Bad\\" Painting signals a further and final dissolution to this project, an end rather than a beginning. To briefly summarise the development - the use of cartoons and banal illustrations in the work of Pop Art pioneers, such as Andy Warhol (1928–1987) and Roy Lichtenstein (1923–1997), soon prompted painting from other kinds of cartoon and illustration and other qualities of painting with which to highlight such sources. The Hairy Who, for example, broadens the project, arriving at more stylised or abstracted cartoon captions and characters, although their inspiration is as much naïve and outsider art as the graphics of Pop Art. However, their wider acceptance with shows between 1966 and -68 surely reflects a momentum created by the success of Pop Art. Funk Art in San Francisco, as in the work of William T. Wiley (b. 1937), similarly continued to mine a strong illustrational style devoted to fine, continuous outline and mainly flat colours, even as it adopted less familiar content. In both cases, the work maintains a cool detachment in manner, as painting, even as its content is much less obviously popular or commonplace. Pop Art is also quick to use art historical references, such as Warhol's Mona Lisa or Lichtenstein's Mondrian and Cézanne illustrations, as a way of driving home the point about painting and print's differences. Subsequent allusion in following styles to famous paintings, inherits some of this irony, although the project steadily dilutes, turns \\"bad\\". Pattern and Decoration (P&D;) actually derives from Minimalist abstraction, but through progressive expansion to compositional formats of basic symmetries and stripes, soon allows overlapping planes – a minimal depth – then shadows or volume, then more concrete objects in symmetrical patterns, and with these a measure of figuration. Patterns of repeating pictures, or serial motifs, are eventually a prominent feature of the style. Sources become textiles and other printed matter, such as wallpaper or wrapping paper. With these, P&D; converges with Pop Art and following styles, dissipates as a project, or turns \\"bad\\" in the hands of fringe practitioners. P&D; sources often carry an additional vulgar or kitsch quality with their earnest, sentimental motifs, once these are removed from a print context and scrutinised as painting. Kitsch, in these cases, becomes something like a badge for the extended exploitation of prints and pattern by painting, a sign of the project's exhaustion. With these precedents in mind, Tucker's examples of \\"Bad\\" Painting may be divided into roughly four groups. To be clear, Tucker does make this division in either her essay or exhibition. What is offered here is simply a demonstration of the consistency of her selection, even as her description proves misleading or inadequate. The first group (in no particular order) brackets works that highlight illustrational styles derived from print sources, although more remotely than Pop Art. The works by Albertson, Carrillo, Hilton and Staley favour this. Note: reproductions of examples cited here, can be found on the New Museum of Contemporary Art's website, listed in the external references below. Albertson's mock symbolic or allegorical scenes, such as Memento Mori (1975) Sex, Violence, Religion + The Good Life (1976) and The Triumph of Chastity (1976) all supply humorous content in contrast with earnest titles, in a broad-brushed style, akin to movie posters or magazine illustration of an earlier era. Carrillo's large-scale Los Tropicanas (1974) presents a futuristic scene peopled with glowing skeletons, female nudes and a strangely mechanical bird. By iconography rather than technique, the work alludes to science fiction as much as Surrealism and to a genre native to print. It is the clash or confusion to style here that signals a poverty or \\"badness\\" to standards. Also of note, the drawing to figures in both Albertson and Carrillo does largely maintain classical proportions and foreshortening, contrary to Tucker's sweeping claims. Hilton's architectural scenes, from Roman and Medieval painting, feature precision and projections akin to the work of Roger Brown (1941–1997), a key Chicago Imagist, and add equally stylised figures, much as architectural illustration uses. All four artists extend the derivation from print styles to less obvious means, less compelling features. The work is \\"bad\\" in comparison with Pop Art, for pursuing techniques and imagery to trivial or nugatory ends for painting, for blurring or obscuring reference in prints. This is something Tucker's catalogue essay actually celebrates, a point to be returned to presently. The second group brackets the work by Cply and Siler, whom retain the strong outlines of comic-strip or animated cartoon figures, stylised drawing and mostly flat colours. Although, Cply's figures are notably looser in drawing than most comic- strips, while the attention to pattern and a decorative flattening in projection also aligns the work with P&D.; In some examples, ribald subject matter pose something of an extension to the genres, presents a more eccentric extension. Siler's equally casual arrangements, such as Spookie Stove (1976) share affinities with Chicago artists such as Karl Wirsum (b. 1939) and Gladys Nilsson (b. 1940), as well as Funk artists, such as the watercolours of Wiley from the late 1960s. The combination itself is a symptom of a growing diffusion, a weakening distinction for both styles. The work is \\"bad\\" for its minor variation, its feeble allusion. The third group brackets works by Brown, Garabedian, Hendon, Linhares, Urquhart and Wegman, where a derivation from P&D; is foremost. Here, more decorative, frontal motifs often emphasise fabric supports, in works such as Urquhart's Interior with Sugar Talk (1977) and Hendon's tapestry-like Mallard with Friend (1977). Repeating motifs are incorporated as a bold wall paper in Interior with Sugar Talk, but the focus for this group is mainly upon the picture as a single, central motif, often with a border or frame, as in Linhares' Turkey (1977), Garabedian's Adam and Eve (1977). Works are generally executed in broad, open or loose brushstrokes, bright colours, a staple of textile design. Brown's work from this time often features patterned borders along the bottom of the picture; however, examples selected for \\"Bad\\" Painting concentrate instead on the centralised motif, flat colours and an oblique projection to the surrounding space. In Woman Wearing a Mask (1972) – one of the standouts to the show – it is presumably the attention given to modish black lace lingerie and high heels, content that recalls advertising, included within a more relaxed composition, that appealed to Tucker. The witty, trompe-l'œil cat mask (a flattened picture within a flattened picture) worn by the woman, is also executed in the casual brushstrokes favoured by textile design. The picture thus shares an insouciant confluence of styles, an amusing \\"badness\\". Again though, it is worth noting that Brown's drawing of the figure in this example is traditional in proportion and modelling, contrary to Tucker's prescription. The fourth group brackets the work of JenneyLarson, Kay The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, New York Magazine, April 20, 1987. and Chatelain, where vigorously brushed grounds to central, simple motifs are prominent. The derivation is not so much to Pop Art and print sources, but to Jasper Johns' (b. 1930) use of stencils and templates, filled with short, broad, impasto strokes. Stencils, like prints, afford multiple instances and establish strict conventions in wide use, acquire a certain authority for it. They are essentially designs, whether of the American flag or a target. John's compliance with them remains rugged but respectful, or highly ambivalent. His work from the 1950s is usually seen as an important precursor, if not initiator, of Pop Art. Jenney's work from the late 1960s, such as Girl and Vase (1969), exchanges stencils for simple outlines, usually of a familiar or topical object. Yet the structure retains some of Johns' ambivalence. The precise outline constrains boldly brushed filling in narrow areas or shapes, while in broader, less defined areas, allows the brushwork greater prominence, so that it undermines content there, creates a decorative or detached ground. Significantly, Jenney described this developmentSmith, Roberta, ART REVIEW; And When He Was Bad, He Certainly Was Busy, New York Times, March 30, 2001. as \\"bad drawing\\". But Jenney's selection for \\"Bad\\" Painting is curious, in that the work was nine years old at the time of the exhibition, and widely recognised. However, Tucker's selection concentrates on examples where the object or drawing style loses some of its familiarity and gives the rugged treatment a more mannered, arbitrary quality. A Chatelain example such as Untitled (1977) extends this development, so that figures have become more cursory, perhaps Expressionist. Any rationale for the stooping figure on the left of the picture, for example, is now lost and the surrounding ground, granted even greater latitude to impasto brushstroke and colour. Once more, the work exhausts a seam of rigid iconography and painterly treatment, arrives at a ‘bad’ icon, or an icon treated \\"badly\\". All four groups thus trace a steady diffusion to print sources and the means with which painting distinguishes itself from them. The stylistic lineage offered here demonstrates a greater coherence and articulation than Tucker's catalogue essay, and indicates several inaccuracies to her description but essentially confirms her choices. \\"Bad\\" Painting remains a useful style with which to survey American figurative painting toward the end of the 1970s. Tucker's sense of an emerging post modern era was in part true, in as much as she detected a pervasive dissolution, but \\"Bad\\" Painting did not announce the end of progress, or further development in painting, as she supposed (see quote below). The style itself was too diffuse, too peripheral, geographically and stylistically, to exert a decisive influence. Influence It is clear from her catalogue essay, that Tucker saw \\"Bad\\" Painting as a dilemma for notions of progress and assessment. \\"The freedom with which these artists mix classical and popular art-historical sources, kitsch and traditional images, archetypal and personal fantasies, constitutes a rejection of the concept of progress per se... It would seem that, without a specific idea of progress toward a goal, the traditional means of valuing and validating works of art are useless. Bypassing the idea of progress implies an extraordinary freedom to do and to be whatever you want. In part, this is one of the most appealing aspects of \\"bad\\" painting - that the ideas of good and bad are flexible and subject to both the immediate and the larger context in which the work is seen.\\"Tucker, Marcia, Press Release, New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, 1978, see external link for reference. Unfortunately, Tucker does not supply this larger context, in which one might see a \\"progression\\" of figurative painting styles up to 1978. Nor does she acknowledge that \\"the extraordinary freedom\\" accorded the artist under such an arrangement is also useless, if standards for individuality multiply with number of individuals. Flexibility and subjectivity on these terms becomes excessive. Indeed, the development Tucker sketches might also be described as a drastic dissolution for the critic, whereby each work must be accorded its own style, each style applied only to one work. Comparison or assessment thus becomes futile. Badness, on these terms, has little to recommend it. Bad Painting is sometimes seen a precursor to the wider movement of Neo-Expressionism that follows in the early 80s, a style with branches in Germany, Italy and France, amongst other nations. But there are important differences. Tucker's selection does not concentrate upon large-scale works, featuring broad, urgent facture, applied to allegorical or metaphorical themes, frequently political or historical. Her selection is more wide-ranging. Bad Painting shares none of the shrillness, the social provocation often found in Neo-Expressionism. \\"Bad\\" Painting is typically more restrained, in scale and scope, more light-handed in touch, light-hearted in sentiment. Similarly, \\"Bad\\" Painting is often associated with New Image Painting,Marshall, Richard, New Image Painting, Whitney Museum of American Art (catalogue) New York, December 1978 - January 1979. another trend in figurative painting defined by an exhibition later in 1978, curated by Richard Marshall. But there, the trend is focused upon New York-based artists and a derivation closer to that outlined for Jenney, who was also included. Where \\"Bad\\" Painting does find later resonance is with the publication of Thrift Store PaintingsThrift store paintings are cited as inspiration for \\"Bad\\" Painting by Tucker in Albertson, James et al, \\"Bad\\" Painting, New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, 1978, p.1, p.13. by the painter Jim Shaw in 1990. As the title suggests, Shaw's collection is drawn from humble, second- hand sources, rather than an explicit criterion of badness. But the collection is not concerned with surprising bargains for the conventional art collector. On the contrary, it is a catalogue of discarded or rejected tastes. It amounts to \\"bad\\" painting, in the more general sense, of poor judgement, technical incompetence or outsider indulgence. Its appearance and impact in 1990 demonstrates a further plurality to figurative styles of painting, an extension to Bad Painting, although not an exhaustive one. Because of the priority given to place of purchase in Thrift Store Painting, works are mainly easel-scale and devoted to traditional themes, factual and fictional. There is no place for \\"bad\\" Minimalism on a site-specific scale or geometric abstraction, for instance, no works abandoned by recent ambitious art students or failed post modernists. Thrift Store Paintings is devoted to the peripheral, the clumsy and comic, as was Tucker's Bad Painting. The difference is that Shaw allows a wider array of figurative styles, from the Naïve to Surreal or Expressionist, the Photo-realistic to Pop or decorative. But again, importantly, works are never wholly of one style; instead, hover uncomfortably or \\"badly\\" between conflicting categories, summoning too many standards, too weakly. Thrift Store Paintings is rarely linked to Bad Painting in published criticism, however. Shaw's publication was received favourably and led to later exhibitions. Critics still occasionally revile them,Darwent, Charles, Good. Bad. It's all the same in the end, The Independent, July 16, 2006. but this is perhaps to miss their sophisticated appeal, their potent suggestion. Their acceptance also coincides, and possibly prompts work by John Currin (b. 1962), Lisa Yuskavage (b. 1962) and George Condo (b. 1957), for example, where the focus is upon portraiture and stereotypes, much like Thrift Store Paintings, but provides a more directed mix of technical virtuosity with vulgarity, caricature with idealism, stylisation with realism. Such work is sometimes associatedBadura-Triska, Eva, et al, Bad Painting – good art , exhibition catalogue, Museum Moderner Kunst, Vienna, 2008, with \\"bad\\" painting, for degrading or conflating traditional iconography, but the difference lies in a narrowed scope for these later artists. Fewer \\"bad\\" elements are managed within a more obvious structure, are \\"bad\\" perhaps in anatomy or drawing, but \\"good\\" in volume or tone, colour or composition. Such work remains popular but generally earns no more precise grouping than Post Modern. By contrast, \\"bad painting\\" has been invoked by the artist Albert Oehlen (b. 1954) for dual exhibitions, contrasting bodies of work dedicated to \\"bad painting\\" and \\"good painting\\". But Oehlen's concern is really with accommodating figuration and abstraction within the same work, with demonstrating degrees or a spectrum between them. Good and bad here fall between a purity of means – formal or intrinsic properties to painting – and impurity of ends – extrinsic content to a picture. This is a far broader criterion for figurative painting than Tucker's Bad Painting or related subsequent developments and gains little by an association. Finally, the influence of \\"Bad\\" Painting was not immediate or sustained, on American painting or internationally. Albertson, Carrillo, Chatelain, Hilton, Siler and Staley achieved no wider recognition. However, the style anticipated a growing interest in other kinds of pictures for painting, not exclusively predicated upon print models, not exclusively private or remote.

The senior Forgotston owned Newellton Electric Company and served for twenty years on the Newellton Town Council.\\"Forgotston Seeks Alderman Post in Newellton\\", Tensas Gazette, July 22, 1976, p. 1 Forgotston, Jr. graduated in 1962 from the now defunct Newellton High School, which in 2006 became an elementary school. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. In 1970, he received his juris doctor from LSU's Paul M. Hebert Law Center, also in Baton Rouge. Forgotston worked thirteen years for the state legislature, the last seven as counsel of the Appropriations Committee under then chairman Kevin P. Reilly, Sr., of Baton Rouge. In 1973, Forgotston was a senior staff member of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention, which drafted the current state constitution. In 2013, Forgotston opposed Bobby Jindal's proposal to end the Louisiana state income tax accompanied by an increase in sales taxes. At the time, Forgotston correctly predicted that Jindal's plan would fail to clear the legislature because of the higher sales taxes, the lack of needed Democratic support to offset Republican defectors, and the likelihood that the plan would not increase overall state revenues. After Jindal subsequently withdrew the plan because of the lack of public and legislative support, the Louisiana Republican Party issued a personal attack on Forgotston.The Moon Griffon Show, April 18, 2013. Forgotston also opposed Jindal's policy toward higher education. In \\"Talk about the South\\", Dayne Sherman coined the term \\"The Forgotston Equilibrium\\", described as an economic principle: Whenever public college and university tuition is increased, the governor and the state legislature cuts higher education funding by an equal or greater amount. Opponent of gambling Forgotston had often been a voice against the expansion of gambling in New Orleans. When Harrah's closed a large casino in 1995, Forgotston asked: \\"Why would you go to New Orleans, a historic city like we have, and go sit in some windowless casino? You want to go drive down St. Charles Avenue. You want to go to the French Quarter. This is an outdoor city. It would be like going to Aspen, and spending the whole time in a bar at a video poker machine.\\" Death and legacy Forgotston remained engaged in the private practice of law until his death. He and his wife, Ella Joy \\"E.

He left her a note on the morning of January 3, 2016, while she was sleeping, with instruction about where she could find his body. Forgotston's friend, Garey Forster, a Republican former state representative from New Orleans who was the state labor secretary under former Governor Murphy J. Foster, Jr., said, \\"I don’t know who will be the conscience of the stuff that’s going on. He had the guts to say what others wouldn’t say. And he always had his facts right. There are few souls like that.” Columnist James Gill called Forgotston \\"The king of the subversive bloggers.\\" Forgotston joked, \\"I don’t just burn bridges, I blow them up.\\" Moon Griffon, on whose radio talk show Forgotston had been a regular guest, said that he hopes to preserve the Forgotston website for information for future users and researchers of Louisiana government.The Moon Griffon Show, January 4, 2016 In a message on the Forgotston website posted on January 12, 2016, E.

In 1985, he founded Project Inform, an education and public policy advocacy group concerned with HIV and AIDS, and continued to lead the organization until 2008. Delaney's efforts to streamline the US Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process have been credited with saving thousands of people from early AIDS deaths. Founder of Project Inform Delaney, who was himself not HIV-positive, started Project Inform in 1985, as public awareness of AIDS was growing but before any treatments had been approved. Through Project Inform, Delaney brought HIV- and AIDS-related issues to the attention of public policy makers and the public, lobbied for an aggressive program of scientific and medical research, and encouraged regulatory agencies to speed the approval of new medications. =Approval of anti-HIV drugs= Delaney encouraged the FDA to use a fast-track review procedure for AIDS drugs, reasoning that dying patients could not afford to wait for the results of meticulous and lengthy research. Delaney saw a divide between the needs of scientists, drug companies, and government agencies on the one hand and patients on the other, with the former insisting on time- consuming drug trials for scientific, litigious and public safety reasons, and the latter demanding a chance to stay alive. Delaney helped to bring about fast-track approval of several HIV drugs, and he encouraged research on many more. =Underground drug trials= Delaney, through Project Inform, facilitated the unofficial testing of potential AIDS medications in the days before a wide variety of antiviral drugs were available to the public. With a lengthy drug approval process and what activists felt was a plodding pace of regulatory agencies, promising new antiviral agents could take many years to reach market. When drugs were unavailable, or when people did not respond to existing medications, some with AIDS relied on untested substances in attempts to cure or alleviate their symptoms. In 1989, Project Inform ran an unauthorized trial of a drug known as \\"Compound Q\\", made from the extract of a cucumber-like plant grown in southeast Asia. Because FDA-run trials of the compound were thought by Project Inform to be proceeding too slowly, the group organised an unofficial clinical trial. Compound Q was flown in from China by a treatment activist and distributed to volunteers who had not responded well to approved medication. Although initial results were positive, and some patients wished to continue receiving the substance, Project Inform closed the trial after several volunteers died. Delaney cautioned against overly optimistic assessments of the drug. Delaney's experiences with underground drug trials as well as the dangers involved are chronicled in Jonathan Kwitny's book, \\"Acceptable Risks: The Explosive Politics of Live vs. Profit in AmericaHow Two Courageous Men Fought the FDA to Save Thousands of AIDS Patients, and Changed the Drug Industry Forever\\". Recognition Shortly before Delaney's death from complications of liver cancer, his achievements were honoured by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Director of the NIAID Anthony Fauci said, \\"Millions of people are now receiving life-saving antiretroviral medications from a treatment pipeline that Marty Delaney played a key role in opening and expanding...It is without hyperbole that I call Marty Delaney a public health hero.\\" Delaney died on January 23, 2009 at his home in San Rafael, California at the age of 63.

This species is known by such generic common names as \\"mud shrimp\\" and \\"ghost shrimp\\". Description Callianassa subterranea has an elongated body, a short small carapace, and a short rostrum. Its pale, translucent exoskeleton is not heavily calcified and remains relatively soft and flexible. Its large claws are unequal in size and are larger in males than in females. C. subterranea has very small eyes and grows up to in length. Like many similar thalassinidean decapods, C. subterranea is a deposit-feeder that ingests sediment particles in order to scrape off and digest the organic coating called biofilm that sticks to them. To facilitate this type of foraging, its mouthparts, except for the mandible, are covered with a variety of setae designed for sediment denitrification. Its pereiopods are highly specialized for the digging activity of a deposit feeder and are not used for grooming. Range and habitat C. subterranea has a widespread marine distribution from Norway to the Mediterranean Sea. It has been recorded in large numbers in the southern North Sea and the north-eastern Irish Sea. Its presence has been recorded on the south coast of Britain and the west coast of Scotland. In Ireland it has been recorded at a single site in the Kenmare River area. However, as it is a subterranean species, it likely has a more widespread range that has been recorded. As its scientific name implies, this species has a burrowing habit and lives underneath the wet, sandy sediment of its benthic zone habitat. C. subterranea creates complex, multi-branched tunnel systems up to 81 cm deep from the lower shore to the shallow sublittoral. Each tunnel complex has several inhalant shafts which terminate on the surface with a funnel-shaped opening in the center of a conical mound of ejected sediment. Its burrows often interconnect in complex patterns with those inhabited by other species of burrowing fish and crabs such as Goneplax rhomboides, Cepola macrophthalma, Lesueurigobius friesii, and Nephrops norvegicus. The construction of the burrows varies according to the characteristics of the sediment in which the individuals dwell and reach their maximum depth and complexity in Scottish sea lochs and other areas with fine-grained mud.

They are allied with the Black Guerrilla Family and some other black prison gangs. The Aryan Brotherhood is one of their main rivals. The D.C. Blacks make up one of the largest single ethnic groups in the overall federal prison population by 10 percent. They are known for being well educated in violence, locker knocking, petty theft, and rape from their time spent at Lorton, a D.C. penitentiary. Although the D.C. Blacks are one of the largest prison gangs within penitentiaries, they are small compared to the gangs outside of the prison system, such as the Bloods and the Crips.  History  The D.C. Blacks prison gang is said to have originated in the late 1960s or the early 1970s. From being in prison, the D.C. Blacks became enemies with another prison gang called the Aryan Brotherhood, which is a group consisting of only convicted white men. The race wars against the D.C. Blacks raged across the federal system in the early 1980s and again in the 1990s when two of the high-ranking officers within the D.C. Blacks were stabbed and killed at the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania by Aryan Brotherhood members. The race war in the federal system between the Aryan Brotherhood and the D.C. Blacks started on November 22, 1981 when a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Thomas “Terrible Tom” Silverstein, murdered a member of the D.C. Blacks, Robert M. Chappelle. An FBI investigation was sparked when Chappelle's body was found dead in his cell at the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. The race war continued when Silverstein killed again on September 27, 1982 when the alleged national leader of the D.C. Blacks, Raymond “Cadillac” Smith, was killed after being stabbed 67 times. The violent campaign against the D.C. Blacks and the alleged race war were at the center of the government's 2002 indictment against the Aryan Brotherhood when one of the leaders from the Aryan Brotherhood allegedly ordered the 1997 killing of two D.C. Blacks at Lewisburg with an invisible ink message written in urine. This message was sent to Lewisburg to warn their other members that the D.C. Blacks called hits on two of their members. Messages began to be going back and forth between the two penitentiaries calling hits on both gangs. In December 1996, the D.C. Blacks killed a white inmate at the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg. The prison gang reached their limit with this murder and started to be transferred from Lewisburg to Marion. Since Lewisburg was having racial problems, a white inmate was transferred from Lewisburg to Marion and was told to start making knives and organizing the Aryan Brotherhood members. On January 2, 1997, about a dozen members of the D.C. Blacks attacked six white inmates at Marion. Michael Wagner, an Aryan Brotherhood member, was transferred by prison officials from Marion to the supermax prison at Florence, Colorado to prevent him from assaulting any members from the D.C. Blacks. One of the Aryan Brotherhood leaders, Barry Byron Mills, authorized the wars between them and the D.C. Blacks so they could be nationwide, killing as many of the D.C. Blacks as they could. The D.C. Blacks became one of the driving forces behind the rising violence across all penitentiaries. They are described as one of the largest and most problematic gangs within the federal population. This gang is known to be problematic because they are said to be very proficient with all kinds of improvised weapons. Eddie Griffin, a convict from Marion, stated that the D.C. Blacks knew the art and science of killing. The members could allegedly carry out an execution and get rid of all evidence within minutes. After Silverstein killed Chappelle, the D.C. Blacks were quick to retaliate. They plotted and carried out the execution of Neil Baumgarten, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, in 1982. The gang started to target other ethnicities as the race war was heating up. Assassinations and executions were carried out for most of the 1990s at Marion. The D.C Blacks eventually had a gang clash with the Sureños, a Hispanic prison gang, as well as with other fellow African-Americans. Attacks between prison gangs became a normal action within penitentiaries following into the 2000s. Today, members of the D.C. Blacks still inhabit some of the United States correctional facilities. Local law enforcement agencies as well as the FBI are still attempting to clean up the mess and contain the situation between the gangs. Individuals from both the D.C. Blacks and the Aryan Brotherhood have testified in court, giving the public a general idea of what life at Marion looked like. Although it is allegedly known that the Aryan Brotherhood committed the most murders in the race war, two black prison gang members have testified that the notorious Aryan Brotherhood was too small and weak to attack a rival black gang behind bars and incite a race war. The case, US vs Mills, No CR02-938 (C) (C.D. Calif.), is believed to be one of the largest death penalty cases in U.S. history. It alleges that imprisoned Aryan Brotherhood ringleaders orchestrated 32 murders and attempted murders over a 30-year period. Of the 40 people originally arrested, up to 16 could face the death penalty in several trials.  Aryan Brotherhood rivalry  The Aryan Brotherhood, also known as the Brand or the AB, is a white prison gang and organized crime syndicate in the United States with an estimated 15,000–20,000 members in and out of prison. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Aryan Brotherhood makes up an extremely low percentage of the entire US prison population but is responsible for a disproportionately large number of prison murders. To join, members may swear a blood oath or take a pledge; acceptance into the Aryan Brotherhood is aided by a prospect's willingness to kill a black or a Hispanic prisoner.  Major presence in penitentiaries  = United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg = The United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania is a high- security United States federal prison for male inmates. The start of the race wars between the D.C. Blacks and the Aryan Brotherhood began at Lewisburg. This was the penitentiary that both the D.C.

Marion was the penitentiary where the prison gangs were transferred when they reached their limit with murders and other violent acts. Some members from the D.C.

Blacks carried out the most assassinations and executions at Marion in the 1990s. The D.C. Blacks and the Aryan Brotherhood have testified in court about how life at Marion looked like.

It is a tributary of the River Trent and runs for around 18 miles from source to its confluence with the River Trent. Etymology The Origins of the name Blithe probably come from the Old English for gentle,cheerful,quiet or merry. This is probably rooted in fact as the River runs as a gentle stream for most of its journey to the River Trent. Course The Blithe rises in the Hills to the East of Stoke on Trent near to Heywood Grange Farm at around 800 feet above sea level. It is joined by several smaller streams as it makes its way towards Caverswall. The River though is still only a small stream at this stage. It passes the village of Blythe Bridge and roughly follows the Stoke to Derby Railway line until it reaches Church Leigh. The countryside is mainly agricultural and is intensively farmed. The River then turns south and flows into Blithfield Reservoir at Newton Hurst. On leaving the reservoir it flows south-east for about another 5 miles, passing the village of Hamstall Ridware until it reaches its confluence with the River Trent at King's Bromley. Blithfield Reservoir The River Blithe runs into the Blithfield Reservoir between Stafford and Burton-upon-Trent. The reservoir was constructed by the South Staffordshire Water Company and was opened in 1953.Official South Staffordshire Water Website The reservoir is a major water source for South Staffordshire but is also utilised for a range of leisure activities from Angling to Sailing.

History Evangelical Methodist Church West Orange was originally part of the Native American Hackensack clan's territory, for over 10,000 years. The Hackensack were a phratry of the Unami tribe of the Leni Lenape. In their language, \\"Leni Lenape\\" means, \\"The Original People.\\" The Acquackanonk sub- tribe were located along the Passaic River. They were part of the Algonquin language family, and known as \\"Delaware Indians\\" by the 18th century. They identified themselves with the totem of the Turtle. They were hunter- gatherers, matrilineal, and had cultural traditions such as Wedding Ceremonies. Northfield Ave and Old Indian Road in West Orange, remain as original Hackensack trails. Their main settlement was where the city of Hackensack is today. They would travel to the ocean or mountains to hunt for food. The Passaic River runs in an upside-down V shape - west and east, and north of West Orange. In the centuries prior to industrial development, the Passaic River and Watchung Mountains were major geographic landmarks amidst the untouched wilderness. West Orange is located at the peak of the Watchung Mountains. This vantage point over the valleys east to Manhattan - had a strategic value for Lenni Lenape warriors, and later George Washington's troops during the American Revolution. The wooded South Mountain Reservation has rocks shaped like the backs of large turtles. The area is now known as \\"Turtle Back Rock Picnic Area\\" and gives its name to the Turtle Back Zoo. The Turtle Back Rocks were considered sacred to the Native Americans. The Native Americans were hunter-gatherer tribes who would overlap territories and occasionally had tribal wars, but did not \\"own\\" land. They believed in taking only what was immediately necessary from nature, and considering the needs of the next seven generations. This hospitality at first benefited the European settlers, who struggled in the wilderness after reaching North America's shores. In the 1500s and 1600s, the territory was disputed and transferred many times between the Hackensack, Dutch, Scottish, Swedes, and English colonists. Due to the wars between the Native Americans and European settlers, most European settlers stayed East of the Hudson River. In 1664, the English took possession of Dutch New Netherland. On October 28, 1664, The English purchased of land from the Hackensack, from Staten Island to the Passaic River on the North to the Raritan River on the South, for about 154 English pounds. This is known as the \\"Elizabethtown Purchase.\\"The First English Purchase of Land in New Jersey, Descendants of Founders of New Jersey.

However, the Hackensack tribe disputed this purchase, and said it was not included in the Elizabethtown Purchase. On July 11, 1667, Treat settled the purchase through Samuel Efsal, a Lenni Lenape interpreter. He then founded \\"New Ark\\" or Newark, establishing it as a Puritan theocracy, as had been done in Milford, CT. The Newark territory kept extending West as the English overthrew the Dutch and claimed or purchased more Hackensack territory. This expansion was effected primarily by individual property owners, who would purchase tracts of land bit by bit. Sometimes they would name it after themselves or where they were from in Europe. Often the borders were not clearly defined, and few if any maps remain.1666 – The Founding of Newark, Descendants of Founders of New Jersey.

By the 1700s West Orange was known as part of the Newark Mountains. During the American Revolution, the valleys were populated by farms and mills. The area on Main Street now known as \\"Tory Corner\\" was called Williamstown, after two brothers Nathaniel and Benjamin Williams. Nathaniel and his two eldest sons were Loyalists to the British crown, and gathered other Loyalists for meetings. Nathaniel took his eldest sons James and Amos to join the British Army in 1777, and never returned. Meanwhile, Nathaniel's wife Mary Williams stayed on the farm with her younger children. Her farm house had been built in 1720. She gave freely to Washington's revolutionary troops. James finally returned to the farm decades later, to reunite with his mother Mary. Nathaniel and Amos never returned. Nathaniel died of smallpox in New York. A plaque to Mary Williams was erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1922.

Geography It is situated at the head of the sea loch, Loch Carron, between the rivers, River Carron and River Taodail, in Wester Ross, Scottish Highlands. Amenities It has a hotel called the Strathcarron Hotel and the Strathcarron railway station. History In the spring of 1854, one of the most notorious incidents of resistance to the Highland Clearances took place at Greenyards in Strathcarron, when Major Robertson of Kindeace attempted to evict his tenants to make way for more profitable sheep farming. It was reported by The Inverness Courier that the Sheriff Taylor at the head of about thirty-five men traveled from Tain and arrived at Greenyards at about dawn. Their arrival was expected and they were met by a crowd of about 300 people, two thirds of whom were women. They were all apparently prepared to resist the execution of the law. The women lined up at the front armed with stones and the men at the rear armed with sticks. The Sheriff tried to persuade them not to resist, as did Cummings who was the superintendent of the Ross-shire police. The sheriff reluctantly then had to use force and the police attacked the crowd and dispersed them. However, during the violence, fifteen or sixteen women were seriously hurt, some requiring medical treatment, as the police appeared to have used their batons with great force. The sheriff had served summonses on four tenants. The police tried to capture some of the men, but only captured five women. Sheriff Mackenzie later gave an account in which he said that the large number of people who had arrived to resist had been signaled to the spot by gun-shots. The women who had been captured were taken to the prison at Tain but they were released on bail the next day. The incident, which took place on 31 March, 1854, became known as \\"The Massacre of the Rosses\\". There was afterwards universal feeling among the people of Ross- shire and Sutherlandshire that the sheriff's conduct was reckless and there was indignation and disgust at the brutality of the policemen on the women which had left pools of blood on the ground. One woman was reported to have died in this encounter. Trivia Strathcarron is home to indie-folk musicians The Ramisco Maki Maki Rocking Horse and Oak Hero.

In Germanic mythology, an idis (Old Saxon, plural idisi) is a divine female being. Idis is cognate to Old High German itis and Old English ides, meaning 'well-respected and dignified woman.' Connections have been assumed or theorized between the idisi and the North Germanic dísir; female beings associated with fate, as well as the amended place name Idistaviso. Attestations =Idisi= One of the two Old High German Merseburg Incantations call upon female beings—idisi—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads: > :'Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there, :some bound fetters, some hampered > the army, :some untied fetters: :Escape from the fetters, flee from the > enemies.'Simek (2007:171). =Ides= In line 1259 of the Old English poem Beowulf, Grendel's Mother is introduced as an ides: > :1258: ... Grendles modor :1259: ides, aglæcwif ...Chickering (2006:120). Theories The idisi mentioned in the first Merseburg Incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that \\"these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology\\" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name Herfjötur (Old Norse \\"army-fetter\\"). Hilda Ellis Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English Wið færstice charm, and theorizes a similar role for them both.Davidson (1990:63). Simek says that the West Germanic term Idisi (Old Saxon idis, Old High German itis, Anglo-Saxon ides) refers to a \\"dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin matrona\\" and that a link to the North Germanic term dísir is reasonable to assume, yet that it is not undisputed. In addition, the place name Idisiaviso (meaning \\"plain of the Idisi\\") where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 CE. Simek points to a connection between name Idisiaviso, the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations, and valkyries.Simek (2007:171). \\"The Dises\\" (1909) by Dorothy Hardy. Regarding the dísir, Simek states that Old Norse dís appears commonly as simply a term for 'woman,' just as Old High German itis, Old Saxon idis, and Anglo-Saxon ides, and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, \\"several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the disir were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in Guðrúnarkviða I 19 the valkyries are even called Herjans disir 'Odin's disir'. The disir are explicitly called dead women in Atlamál 28 and a secondary belief that the disir were the souls of dead women (see fylgjur) also underlies the landdísir of Icelandic folklore.\\"Simek (2007:61–62). Simek says that \\"as the function of the matrons was also extremely varied – fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses – the belief in the dísir, like the belief in the valkyries, norns, and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses.\\" Jacob Grimm proposes a potential connection to the name of the Norse goddess Iðunn and the idisi. Grimm states that \\"with the original form idis the goddess Idunn may possibly be connected.\\"Grimm (1882:402-403). Notes References * Chickering Jr., Howell D. (2006).

Te Awanui Drive is part of an expressway that connects Tauranga to Mount Maunganui. On the Tauranga side, Te Awanui Drive connects to Takitimu Drive, which crosses the Chapel Street Viaduct before running along the edge of the Waikareao Estuary. On the Mount Maunganui side, Te Awanui Drive connects to Hewletts Road, which runs through an industrial area towards Maunganui Road. History Plaques at the Tauranga Harbour Bridge The original bridge was opened on 13 March 1988 by former Mayor of Tauranga, Robert Arthur Owens. Prior to the opening of the bridge, traffic wishing to travel between Tauranga and Mount Maunganui had to use the Hairini and Maungatapu bridges. The Tauranga Harbour Bridge was tolled from opening until 22 July 2001. The tollbooths were on the Mount Maunganui side of the bridge. As the population of Tauranga grew, the bridge began to get very congested during the peak hours. As part of the Harbour Link project (which also included the construction of the Chapel Street Viaduct, the widening of Hewletts Road, and the construction of the Hewletts Road Flyover), a new bridge was constructed next to the original. On 7 September 2009, the new bridge opened. The original bridge now carries traffic towards Tauranga; the new bridge carries traffic towards Mount Maunganui. Causeway On the Mount Maunganui side of the bridge is a causeway which carries Te Awanui Drive and houses the Tauranga Bridge Marina. At the other end of the causeway, two parallel bridges, collectively known as Aerodrome Bridge, cross a small channel of water, and connect the causeway to Mount Maunganui. Until 2009, there was only one Aerodrome Bridge, and the road that ran along the causeway was only one lane each way. The road was widened and a second Aerodrome Bridge was built as part of the Harbour Link project.

Her sentence was later commuted to life in prison. Blake resided in Botany, New South Wales and was aged 35 when she was arrested.Kelly, Neil. Baby joins parents in jail. The Sun News-Pictorial: 24 January 1987, p.4. Arrest Blake was arrested on 23 January 1987 outside a department store opposite Lumphini Park along with her de facto husband Paul Hudson. With them was their baby son Todd Paul John. 4.47 kilograms of heroin was hidden inside the pillow in her son's push chair. The couple and their child spent the first night after the arrest together with other prisoners in a police cell. The child went into the care of the Australian embassy the following day. Police had been monitoring the pair and saw them pass US$49,000 to a Thai national and accept eight packets which they stuffed into the pillow in the pram. The heroin was said by police to be of \\"the lowest grade of purity\\". An officer also claimed that the presence of the child and push chair increased their suspicions as a French film showing in Bangkok at that time, Three Men and a Cradle, had involved drug smugglers hiding heroin in a baby's nappy for a drop. The Thai man, massage parlour operator Supoj Kittidejdamkern, was arrested as he drove away after the meeting. Police followed Blake and Hudson some distance before arresting them. Police said Blake and Hudson had made ten visits to Thailand in the previous seven years. Blake and Hudson said the numerous trips to Thailand were funded by her work as a school teacher and Hudson's work as a fencing contractor, which earned an average of $1,500 a week. Shortly before the arrest Hudson had also received a $58,000 compensation payment from a car accident. Blake and Hudson reportedly were drug addicts and heavy users of heroin. It was speculated that they were medium level drug dealers supplying heroin in small quantities to distributors to deliver around Sydney, that they received about $40,000 for each trip to Bangkok, and that Blake was the brains behind the operation. They came to the attention of Thai police after making contact with major players in Bangkok drug rings.Kelly, Neil. Only remorse may save Blake now. The Sydney Morning Herald: 20 June 1988, p.10. Hudson, a 37-year-old Sydney carpenter, described himself as a drug addict who had previously been arrested and jailed in Indonesia on heroin possession charges.AP. Death for Aussie woman in heroin trial. New Straits Times: 16 June 1988, p.8. One news report quoted a quantity of 8 kg of heroin. Hudson said that he hadn't bought 8 kg, that \\"I only wanted a little bit\\", and that it was for personal use. Hudson says he initially admitted to buying the drugs and implicated the Thai national because he had been told by police that Blake and their son would then be freed. \\"I was trying to get the wife and baby out, but now all bets are off. I will deny everything I have signed and start from scratch.\\" Hudson said that he and Blake had visited Thailand seven times in ten years, not 10 times in seven years as police had claimed. He denied being a heroin addict and denied having ever been convicted of drug trafficking. He admitted he had previously used heroin and had been previously \\"busted\\" for possessing drugs. He denied having planned to import the drugs to Australia, and said that importation of 8 kg was impossible. \\"Anyway, whenever we arrive at Sydney Airport they search us. They have sometimes kept us for three or four hours. I've even been searched internally and have been taken to hospital for ultrasounds.\\"Mellor, Bill. Heroin man admits deal. The Sun Herald: 25 January 1987, p.9. Their son was kept with Blake and Hudson at Bangkok's Bangrak police station at their request. It was not until 24 hours later that agreement was reached to hand him over to Australia's consular officer Graham Colless. Blake told her lawyers she wanted the baby back with her in prison, something not permitted under Thai law. Their son was aged 14 months at the time of his parents' arrest. He was sent to live with Blake's mother in Sydney, where her two other sons from a previous marriage also lived.Kelly, Neil. Machinegun death. The Sun News-Pictorial: 16 June 1988, p.1. Blake and Hudson were charged with possession of illegal drugs with intent to sell. Trial The trial of Blake and Hudson was held on Wednesday 15 June 1988 at the Bangkok Criminal Court. Shortly after their arrest Hudson had provided a written confession claiming he alone had been involved in the drug deal and that Blake knew nothing of it. While admitting to possession, Hudson denied that he intended to sell the drugs. At the trial, Blake claimed innocence and pleaded not guilty. Blake and Hudson were both found guilty and sentenced to death; however, Hudson's sentence was commuted to life because of his confession. The trial was conducted in Thai with no interpreters. Blake, who spoke some Thai, struggled to follow the reportedly rushed proceedings. She was informed of the outcome only while being led back to the holding cells, and was seen to stagger and almost fall with shock. She later declared that \\"They're going to kill me. I knew it was coming. I shall not appeal.\\" At the trial Kittidejdamkern also denied possessing or trafficking in heroin. He was also found guilty and sentenced to death. The court said the maximum penalty was imposed due to the large quantity of heroin involved. Blake translated the verdict for Hudson, who appeared pale and shaken. Hudson reported that \\"She never knew it was in the bags I was carrying. She never looked in them - she was just window shopping at the time\\". The court judgement stated that \\"her words of denial did not convince the court\\". The court stressed that several policemen had seen Blake sitting with Kittidejdamkern at a coffee shop table, working out sums on a pocket calculator. Two New South Wales people were arrested and charged after being found to be involved in the Bangkok case. Death sentence It was rare for Westerners to receive the death sentence in Thailand, which was, at the time, carried out by automatic rifle(s). One other was Australian pilot Donald Tait who in 1987 was being held in a Thai prison awaiting the death sentence for drug smuggling. However, by the time of Blake's trial in June 1988 Tait had successfully appealed against the verdict and was back in Australia. Blake was the first Westerner in modern Thailand to face death by firing-squad. She was the first Western woman in Thailand to be sentenced to death.Downie, Sue. Drug mum's plea: don't worry. The Sun News- Pictorial: 17 June 1988, p.4. No western foreigner had been executed in Thailand in preceding decades and there had been no execution of a Thai national on drug charges since the mid-1970s. Sentence commuted Blake was imprisoned in Klong Prem Central Prison. The day after the trial she said she had changed her mind and would appeal against the death sentence. In the prison she worked in the kitchen, and took classes learning the Thai language and hairdressing. Her sentence was commuted to life in 1991.Convicted Australian woman gets reprieve. New Straits Times: 8 March 1991, p.23. At the time of Sandra Gregory's arrival at Klong Prem Central Prison in February 1993 Blake was a prison trustee who spoke fluent Thai. Blake was asked to meet and act as a translator for Gregory on her arrival.Gregory, Sandra. with Michael Tierney. Forget You Had a Daughter, Vision Paperbacks. 2003, p.92-3 . Blake received a Royal Pardon and was released in March 1998 having spent 11 years and two months in prison. She returned home on 24 March 1998.

Following increasing event success, its location was changed to its current position on meadows by the banks of the River Welland, with a name change to 'Music on the Meadows'. In 1999 it was rebranded as the 'Riverside Festival'. A more organised approach to the running of the event included the introduction of more stages and stalls. Because of the increasing financial strain of running a free festival, and ever-mounting difficulties in obtaining sponsorship, a request was made for a donation from adults on entry. Other changes included the banning of bringing alcohol to the event, in line with police recommendations. After 3 successive cancellations the organisation began referring to the festival in the past tense. It may never be held again.

(Henry) Quarantelli (November 10, 1924 – April 3, 2017) was an American sociologist, pioneering the sociology of disaster.Biography. Education Quarantelli received his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1959. From 1963 to 1984 he worked as professor of sociology at the Ohio State University, where he founded the Disaster Research Center (DRC). In 1985 he took the DRC to the University of Delaware, where he worked until 1998. Major works and contributions =Emergencies, Disasters, and Catastrophes Are Different Phenomena= Published in 2000 and supported by the Disaster Research Center at Ohio State University, this article discusses the differences between emergencies, disasters and catastrophes as they are differentiated by disaster researchers. The differences between these phenomena should play a role and make a difference in the planning and management activities of crisis groups and an organization’s crisis plans. Disasters differ from everyday emergencies in that they affect unfamiliar and more groups that lose part of their relative independence, whether autonomy or freedom of action. Disasters also call for a change in performance standards to meet the new needs brought about by said disaster. There is also a collapse in the separation of the private and public sectors. Catastrophes, on the other hand, are determined when majority of the community’s built structure is heavily impacted. Typically, the emergency organization’s buildings are affected themselves. Another characteristic is that personnel are unable to return to their normal routines which often extends into the recovery period. Majority of the everyday community functions are interrupted due to extensive damage of the infrastructure and shortages of supplies. The final characteristic of catastrophes is the inability of neighboring communities to offer assistance since they too have been affected. Lastly, this article presents possible implications to better prepare and handle disasters and catastrophes now that there is a known distinction between the phenomena. =Technological and Natural Disasters and Ecological Problems: Similarities and Differences in Planning For and Managing Them= Published in 1993, these papers focus on answering the following question: for planning and managing purposes to what extent can destructive and damaging situations as are occasioned by natural disasters, civil strife and riots, technological disasters, and ecological problems be viewed as essentially similar phenomena? In order to answer the question, the paper is broken into five major parts. The first part makes a conceptual distinction between natural and technological disasters in terms of being consensus occasions with other crises that are of a conflictive nature. These two types of crises require somewhat different kinds of planning and managing. Due to this, conflict occasions are not further examined. Natural and technological disasters are also distinguished from ecological problems based on their sudden and crisis generating nature. The second section examines how popular thinking affects disaster planning and how some hazard research has tended to conceive of sudden type disasters in agent specific terms. Some examples are hurricanes, chemical explosions, earthquakes, radiation fallout, etc. This paper also questions the value of this approach with its emphasis on physical features of an event. This approach also challenges the distinctions drawn between “Acts of God”/natural disasters, and technological/human created disasters. This paper also suggests that thinking of disasters in general terms rather than agent specific term is more useful. In particular, the value of conceiving of disasters as social phenomena is stressed. The general approach views disasters as social occasions rather than physical happenings and has important implications for the preparing for and managing of such social occurrences. In the final part of the paper, ecological problems are examined. These papers can be found in the Disaster Research Center’s Preliminary Papers. =Major Criteria for Judging Disaster Planning and Managing Their Applicability in Development Societies= Published in 1998, this paper was prepared as a background paper for the International Seminar on the Quality of Life and Environmental Risks in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in October 1996. This paper discusses the important factors of preparing for and managing disaster occasions. In order to assess in the preparedness of planning for and the managing of disasters, the paper answers the following question: What is good planning and managing? The answer has been determined from results of the empirical research undertaken by social and behavioral scientists over a 40-year period. Since there are no significant behavioral differences between natural and technological disaster, there will be no distinction in the discussion of preparedness for them. First, the paper discusses the ten general principles of good disaster planning to a great extent as these are the basis for evaluating a plan as good or bad. These evaluations can be made prior to any disaster occurring. This section is followed with the ten general principles of disaster managing since preparedness has a different criterion than management. Good management does not automatically stem from good planning since there is only a partial correlation between the two processes. This paper concludes with noting that majority of the research studies used were done in developed countries rather than developing ones. In order to address these differences, the paper discusses some possible disaster-related differences between the two kinds of social systems. The conclusion states that the 20 principles derived mostly from studies in developed societies are in applicable to developing countries in varying degrees.

Beneshevich was a corresponding-member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences from 1914, of the Russian Academy of Sciences from 1924, and of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and of the Strassburg Academy of Sciences from 1929. Beneshevich was executed by the Soviet regime in 1938, and is one of the Eastern Orthodox Church's \\"New Martyrs\\". Biography Vladimir Nicolayevich Beneshevich was born on August 9, 1874, in Druya, Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Vitebsk Region in Belarus). He was of Belarusian ethnicity. His father was a bailiff at the local court, and his grandfather was a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church. He had one brother, Dmitri, who was three years older. Beneshevich graduated 'first class' from Gymnasium in 1893. He then studied law at the Saint Petersburg State University from 1893-1897, graduating with a first-degree diploma. From 1897 until 1901 he studied philosophy, law, and history in Germany, first at the University of Heidelberg, then at the University of Leipzig, and finally at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Upon his return to Russia, he married Amata Ludmila Faddeevne (1888-1967), daughter of professor of classical philology Faddei Zielinski at the University of St. Petersburg. The Beneshevichs had three sons; Nikita (1910-1918) and the twins Dmitri (1911-1937) and George (1911-1937). Between 1900-1905 Beneshevich worked in libraries in Europe and the Middle East, studying Slavic and Byzantine written sources, and participated in his first archaeological expeditions to the ancient religious center of Mount Athos, Mount Sinai, Egypt, Greece, Asia Minor, and Palestine. He was granted access to handwritten monastic collections in 49 European libraries, and worked in Paris, Vienna, Munich, and Rome, discovering many hitherto-unknown legal monuments in the process. The main focus of his research activities was to reconstruct the history of Greco- Roman law, based on a systematic source base. He also briefly (1903-1904) taught history of canon law at the Alexander Lyceum. His research findings were published in his Master's thesis on The story of the sources of Canonical Law of the Greek Orthodox ChurchFull title: Канонический сборник XIV титулов со второй четверти VII века до 883 года. К древнейшей истории источников права греко-восточной церкв \\"Canonical Collection of 14 titles from the 2nd half of the 7th century to 883. The story of the sources of Canonical Law of the Greek Orthodox Church\\". in 1905, for which he received a Master of Church Law. He had also discovered three new fragments of the Codex Sinaiticus (these are now housed at the Russian National Library in Saint Petersburg).Бенешевич Владимир Николаевич, \\"Памятники Синая археологические и палеографические\\", Вып. 2, Sankt Petersburg, 1912; V. N. Beneshevich, \\"Catalogus Codicum Manuscriptorum Graecorum qui in Monasterio Sanctae Catherinae in Monte Sina Asservantur\\" St. Petersburg (1911). In 1905, Beneshevich was appointed privat-docent of Byzantine history at the faculty of history and philology at the University of St. Petersburg. In 1908, Benshevich was appointed editor of the journal Обозрения трудов по славяноведению, a post that he would held until 1918. In 1909, Beneshevich was appointed extraordinary professor, and, shortly thereafter ordinary professor of Byzantine history. He also lectured extensively on paleography, and, from 1906 onwards, on the history of canon law at the University's faculty of law, at the St. Petersburg Theological Academy (1906-1909), at the summit of women's courses (1909-1917), at the Raeva (1910-1911), and at the Military Academy of Law (1909-1912). In 1912, Beneshevich received a doctor of law from the Athens State University. In the same year, and together with egyptologist Boris Alexandrovich Turayev and linguist Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr, Beneshevich initiated the founding of the journal Christian East under the auspices of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1914, on the eve of World War I, Beneshevich published his doctoral thesis on the Synagogue among the 50 works and other Canonical Collections of John Scholasticus.Originally: Синагога в 50 титулов и другие юридические сборники Иоанна Схоластика. He was granted a Doctor of Church Law the same year. Between 1917-1918 Beneshevich served as secretary to the Council of the Russian Orthodox Church. Between 1919-1926 he served in several different capacities in the Church's archives and libraries; from 1923-1926, as head of the Public Library of the History of Material Culture Academy, and from 1925-1926 as head librarian of the Greek manuscripts department of manuscripts Public Library in Leningrad. In July 1922, and again in 1924, he was arrested in connection with the Case of the Metropolitan Benjamin, but was not held long in either instance. In 1926, Beneshevich was appointed Secretary of the Byzantine Commission of the USSR. In 1927, he was granted permission to travel to Germany on a three-month scientific mission, where he had the opportunity to study a number of Greek manuscripts. Shortly before his return, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences offered to translate his work on John Scholasticus. Beneshevich consented. In early 1928, Beneshevich was elected corresponding–member to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. =Imprisonment and execution, 1929-1938= In November 1928, he was arrested on charges of spying for the Vatican, Germany and Poland. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and sent to Solovki prison camp. He was returned to Leningrad in 1930 to attend trial with his wife and brother on charges of sedition. In August 1931, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and sent to in the Ukhta-Pechora prison camp. The arrest and searches almost completely destroyed his collection of (copies of) ancient manuscripts. Of the 49 manuscripts known from his published prolegomena on them, only three survived. Some 2000 photographs were also destroyed. At the request of the Old Bolshevik Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich, Beneshevich was released prematurely in March 1933. From 1933 Beneshevich then served as archivist of Greek manuscripts in public libraries, and lectured on Byzantine history at Leningrad State University. The first German edition of his work on John Scholasticus was published in Munich in May 1937. In October, an article in Izvestia portrayed this as a betrayal, and questioned why a Russian scientific work was published in Nazi Germany. Beneshevich was dismissed from his post, and on November 27 was arrested on charges of spying for Germany. Together with his twin sons and brother, who had been indicted on the same charges, Vladimir Nicolayevich Beneshevich was shot by the NKVD on 17 January 1938 in Leningrad.According to a Academy of Sciences membership roll from 1974, Beneshevich was executed on 19 December 1943. However, a document dated 27 February 1938 refers to the execution, which makes the 1943 date implausible. See also . Beneshevich was struck from the rolls of the Russian Academy of Sciences on 29 April 1938. He was exonerated of the charges of treason by a Military Tribunal LVO on 20 August 1958, over 20 years after his execution. Beneshevich was rehabilitated by the Academy of Sciences on 19 December 1958. Contributions Vladimir Nicolayevich Beneshevich published more than 100 works related to Byzantine history and culture.

One of the pupils of Dr. Hans Burch Gram, Vanderburgh contributed a number of valuable research papers and essays in the field as well being credited for introducing homeopathy in Connecticut. He was one of the oldest and most successful practicing homeopathists in the United States at the time of his death. Biography Federal Vanderburgh was born in Beekman, New York, on May 11, 1788. He was one of nineteen children born to Revolutionary War veteran Colonel James Vanderburgh, his father having remarried, and whose family were among the many Dutch-Americans who settled Dutchess County. Vanderburgh was supposedly named in honor of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, suggested by voting lawyer Chancellor Kent, although his mother objected to the full name of Federal Constitution Vanderburgh.King, William Harvey, ed. History of Homoeopathy and Its Institutions in America. Vol. I. New York: Lewis Publishing Company, 1905. (pg. 79-82, 84, 94-95, 200-201) Vanderburgh received a limited and elementary education from public schools, however he was able to study medicine under noted physician Dr. Wright in New Milford, Connecticut, at the age of 17. He remained with Wright only a short time before moving on to New York City, which gave him access to work in major city hospitals and allowed him to attend lectures at medical colleges.Haller, John S. The History of American Homeopathy: The Academic Years, 1820-1935. Binghamton, New York: Haworth Press, 2005. (pg. 43-44, 48) Vanderburgh entered the office of Dr. Stephen Smith, a leading physician in the city at the time, and underwent the usual curriculum of studies graduating before he was 21 years old. While studying under Dr. Smith, he suffered several life-threatening attacks of pulmonary hemorrhage, believed to have been caused by cardiac obstruction or of a tubercular origin, however this did not interfere with his medical studies. After receiving his diploma, Vanderburgh returned to open his own practice in his hometown. He married Hester Orinda Boardman, who belonged to a prominent family in New Milford, and together moved to Geneva, New York, in 1812 or 1813. The area's climate was believed at the time to be beneficial for people suffering from pulmonary disease, much like Minnesota and the Lake Superior regions, and Vanderburgh enjoyed remarkable health well into old age. He remained in Geneva for ten years until turning over his practice to Dr. Martyn Paine, then living in Montreal, and moving back to New York City. It was around this time that he began studying under Dr. Hans Burch Gram which led to his interest in homeopathy. By early 1834, he was involved in the publication of The American Journal of Homoeopathia although the medical journal lasted only four issues. He was also the corresponding secretary of the New York Homeopathic Society. Vanderburgh opened a successful practice, many of his patients belonging to New York high society, and was often requested via telegraph for house calls to country villas during the summer. On a trip to New Milford in 1837, his treatment of the wife of Dr. Charles Taylor encouraged the physician to pursue homeopathy after witnessing her rapid recovery. Taylor eventually became first resident homeopathic physician in Connecticut. In 1834, Dr. John Franklin Gray founded the New York Homœopathic Society. Its stated purpose was for the purpose of protecting, enriching and disseminating such of the propositions and testimonies of Homœopathia as upon mature trial they shall find to be sound and available. The first Officers of the society were: President, John F. Gray; vice-presidents, Edward A. Strong, George Baxter; corresponding secretary, Federal Vanderburgh; recording secretary, Daniel Seymour; treasurer, F. A. Lohse; registrar, A. Gerald Hull; librarian, F. L. Wilsey; finance committee, J. H. Patterson, Oliver S. Strong, L. M. H. Butler, William Bock. He continued his research into homeopathy publishing a number of valuable papers on the subject and, in 1844, sent a formal letter to Judge Cowen in defense of Dr. Henry D. Paine, outlining the legal rights of homeopathic physicians. He became a noted philanthropist in his later years, especially to the poor, and was consulted in various social issues. Vanderburgh also served as the first president of the Dutchess County Society and held the position until his death. In 1867, the 79-year-old Vanderburgh came down with severe pleuro-pneumonia as a result of traveling in poor weather performing house calls. His health began to fail and started suffering from paroxysms dyspnoea, with a sensation of impending suffocation, and was described as \\"utter prostration of all muscular power\\". Although his condition related to dyspnoea had improved by the following spring, he experienced serious weight loss and other health problems. No apparent cause was found for his condition, with exception to his lifelong cardiac hypertrophy affliction, and he died in Rhinebeck, New York, on October 25, 1868. Lindon Hill The land of known as Lindon Hill was originally part of the Artsen-Kip Patent. In 1779, Dr. Thomas Tillotson married Margaret Livingston, daughter of Judge Robert R. and Margaret Beekman Livingston of Clermont. Tillotson purchased from Isaac Van Etten the southerly lot forming part of the lands which had been granted in 1688 by Governor Dongan to Gerrit Aertsen and others. On this property Dr. Tillotson laid out a country place and called it \\"Linwood.\\" Tillotson also acquired 150 acres of the Beekman land lying between Landsmans Kill and the Fallsburgh Creek. This plateau, between the two streams, with extensive views of the Catskill mountains and Hudson river, became known as \\"Linwood Hill\\". At the mouth of Landsmans Kill he built a dock and mill, where grain was ground. Dr. Tillotson died in 1832.Historical and Genealogical Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A. V. Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912 Vanderburg bought \\"Linwood\\". In 1835, John C. Tillotson, son of Thomas Tillotson, sold \\"Lindon Hill\\" to Vanderburgh, who built a house on the bluff overlooking the river, and resided there until his death in 1868. Afterwards Linwood Hill belonged to Harrison G. Dyar.

R. Rahman for the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire. When Danny Boyle, the director of Slumdog Millionaire, approached Rahman to compose its soundtrack, he included the song. \\"Jai Ho\\" accompanies a choreographed dance sequence at the end credits of the film. Indian singer Tanvi Shah wrote and provided vocals for an English section of the song. \\"Jai Ho\\" is a phrase which can be roughly translated as \\"Let [the] victory prevail\\", \\"Let there be victory\\", or \\"May there always be victory\\". \\"Jai Ho\\" was, at the time of its release, \\"the toast of the town in almost every part of the world\\". Covers and remixes of the song and performances of the \\"Jai Ho\\" dance were posted on YouTube. \\"Jai Ho\\" received universally favorable reviews from music critics, who cited it as the best song on the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack. The song won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. It was also the official campaign song of the Indian National Congress during the 2009 election. American girl group The Pussycat Dolls recorded an English interpretation of \\"Jai Ho\\". Entitled \\"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\\", and credited to \\"A. R. Rahman and the Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger\\", the song appeared on the re-release of the group's second studio album Doll Domination (2008).  Background  In 2008, while working on several films, A. R. Rahman received an email from Danny Boyle, the director of the film Slumdog Millionaire, stating: \\"Hey I'm Danny Boyle, I like your work, and it would be great for us to have you on our film\\". Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying \\"when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it\\". While composing the soundtrack to the Slumdog Millionaire, Rahman aimed to mix modern India with eighties soundtracks. Boyle, who \\"hated sentiment and cello\\", told Rahman to \\"never put a cello in my film\\". Boyle also insisted on a \\"pulsey\\" score. Rahman stated that Boyle wanted \\"edgy, upfront\\" music that did not suppress sound. He noted that \\"There's not many cues in the film. Usually a big film has 130 cues. This had just seventeen or eighteen: the end credits, beginning credits\\". The soundtrack for Slumdog Millionaire took Rahman two months to plan and two weeks to complete. He recalled that: \\"Usually it takes six months with the musical films I'm doing in India\\". Rahman said the soundtrack \\"isn't about India or Indian culture. The story could happen anywhere: China, Brazil, anywhere. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is on in every damn country\\".  Writing and composition  \\"Jai Ho\\" was originally composed for Subhash Ghai's 2008 film Yuvvraaj, but the director felt the song to be \\"too subtle and soft\\" for inclusion in the film. Rahman composed \\"Jai Ho\\" using Logic Pro, a digital audio workstation and MIDI sequencer software application created by Apple Inc. At the time of the song's production, Rahman had been using the software for almost 12 years. For \\"Jai Ho\\", Rahman made extensive use of Logic instruments, including the EXS24, which comprises the EVP88 electric piano and ES2 synth mixed with a few plugins, such as the Channel EQ, Bitcrusher and Guitar Amp Pro. The bassline and the \\"trancey, arpeggiated\\" musical line used ES2 presets. For the \\"long chorus vocals\\" in the song, Rahman created a \\"robotic, stair-stepping pitch-bend effect\\" with Logic's Pitch Correction plugin to achieve the \\"exaggerated tuning effect\\". The lyrics to \\"Jai Ho\\" were written by Gulzar and are a combination of Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi. Lyrics in Spanish are also included in the song \\"to go along with his [Rahman] Latin American touch of music\\". According to the India-EU Film Initiative, this inclusion \\"really makes the song quite unique and international\\". Of the three singers credited, Sukhwinder Singh is the principal vocalist. Vijay Prakash sang the portion with the words \\"Jai Ho\\", which takes a high pitch at numerous junctures of the song. Mahalakshmi Iyer sang the Hindi words between the \\"Jai Ho\\" chants and the portions of the verses not sung by Singh. Tanvi Shah sang and wrote the song's Spanish words. According to Rahman, \\"Jai Ho\\" was meant to create \\"a vision of the whole world celebrating this victory\\". The song contains a mix of \\"multiple motifs from the traditional pieces on the soundtrack\\" with \\"the big drums and blasting horns of the present\\". It was originally composed and shortlisted for Subhash Ghai's 2008 film Yuvvraaj. Although Rahman was excited about the song, Ghai \\"wasn't too kicked about it\\". Ghai felt it was \\"too subtle and soft to be picturized on the character played by Zayed Khan\\". Rahman and Gulzar believed the song had \\"immense potential\\" and used it in Slumdog Millionaire. Following the song's win at the Oscar's, Rahman stated that: \\"He [Ghai] said the words had a positive feel. It was like a prayer. I honestly didn't think the song would win me an Oscar though. But like the film Slumdog suggests, everything has its own destiny\\". When asked if he considers \\"Jai Ho\\" as his best creation, Rahman stated: \\"Sometimes it's not about a best creation, but the best for a particular moment of the film. 'Jai Ho' was right for that particular moment, that particular mindset in Slumdog Millionaire. I know there's lot of debate over this song winning the Oscars. But then, I didn't send the song to the Oscars, the makers did. I just composed the tune in three weeks and was done with it. However, I too feel 'Jai Ho' was apt for that particular moment in the film—the protagonist comes out of darkness and pain to light amid 'Jai Ho' hammering in the background.\\"  Critical response  \\"Jai Ho\\" received universally favorable reviews from music critics. Bhasker Gupta of AllMusic labelled the song a highlight of the soundtrack. Tajpal Rathore of BBC Music gave the song a positive review, calling it a \\"quintessential Rahman track\\". He praised Sukhwinder Singh, saying that he \\"does an amazing job\\". Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song and its choreography \\"brilliant\\". He described it as \\"two lovers consummating their long, winding courtship not with sex but a hand- waving, side-stepping, totally cathartic shimmy\\". In a review of the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack, Joginder Tutej of Bollywood Hungama deemed \\"Jai Ho\\" the \\"flagship number\\" of the film. Tutej complimented Sukhwinder Singh's vocals as being \\"energetic\\" and concluded that the singer \\"can comfortably add on another big chartbuster to his name\\". He also stated that the song, while \\"boasting of an amazing mix of melody and rhythm\\" remains \\"Indian at heart\\" and is \\"instantly catchy\\". He concluded that: \\"No wonder, it is the lone promotional song of the film and also sees a music video being dedicated to it. Gulzar saab celebrates the spirit of love and life with 'Jai Ho' and infuses enough power in it that justifies all the nominations it is receiving today\\".  Recognition  According to the India-EU Film Initiative \\"Jai Ho\\" became \\"the toast of the town in almost every part of the world\\". They noted that: \\"Music experts are listening to the song again and again to appreciate the global texture of the song and at the same time they are admiring the beauty of the lyrics by India's foremost lyricist Gulzar who, like AR Rahman, has always experimented with his narrative\\". According to Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times: \\"YouTube now has vids of babies and girlfriends doing this Jai Ho dance. There are remixes and tributes, too\\". \\"Jai Ho\\" received an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 81st Academy Awards on 22 February 2009. The song beat out WALL-E's \\"Down to Earth\\" by Peter Gabriel and \\"O... Saya\\", also of Slumdog Millionaire, by A. R. Rahman and M.I.A. \\"Jai Ho\\" also received a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture during the 52nd Grammy Awards on 31 January 2010. The song received a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Song during its 2008 award ceremony on 8 January 2009. The Houston Film Critics Society nominated it for Best Original Song during its 2008 awards ceremony on 17 December 2008. It was also nominated by the MTV Movie Awards for Best Song From a Movie during its 2009 award ceremony on 31 May 2009.  Live performances  Rahman and Singh performed \\"Jai Ho\\" live during the 81st Academy Awards on 22 February 2009, the night it won for the award for Best Original Song. The song served as the opening of the ceremony. The song's lyricist, Gulzar, made a guest appearance during the performance. Rahman modified the song to \\"set it in sync with the live orchestra and make it suitable for a stage presentation\\". \\"Jai Ho\\" was performed as part of a medley with \\"Jiyo Utho Badho Jeeto\\" during the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games opening ceremony on 28 August 2010. Rahman, who wore a white bandhgala jacket, black pants and white shoes, was accompanied by hundreds of dancers wearing traditional Indian costumes. Following the performance of \\"Jiyo Utho Badho Jeeto\\", fireworks went off and \\"Jai Ho\\" began. An editor from Sify wrote that, during the performance of \\"Jai Ho\\", \\"the chant at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, many would swear, was magical\\".  Usage in media  In March 2009, Super Cassettes Industries (T-Series), the music company which holds the song's copyright for India, received nearly $200,000 from the governing Indian National Congress party for its use in its national campaign in 2009 Indian General Elections. Harindra Singh, vice-chairman and managing director of the advertising firm Percept, told BBC that: \\"The tune of the song and the Jai Ho phrase have been used in the campaign. The lyrics have been written by a combination of people, they will be projecting what the Congress wishes to communicate\\". \\"Popular Bollywood numbers\\" are often \\"re-jigged\\" by political parties in India to \\"convey their message to voters\\", but this is the first time that a party has ever bought exclusive rights to use a song for political promotion. The version used in the campaign features altered lyrics sung by Sukhwinder Singh, who performed on the original song. A video was also shot for this version. Rahman refused to comment on \\"Jai Ho\\" being used for the campaigns, but stated that the song \\"belongs to everyone\\". \\"Jai Ho\\" was performed by Ravi K Tripathi, a Lucknow-based singer, at the closing ceremony of 16th Asian Games on 27 November 2010.  English adaption  The Pussycat Dolls performing \\"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\\" as the opening act of Britney Spears' 2009 tour, The Circus Starring Britney Spears American girl group the Pussycat Dolls recorded an English interpretation of \\"Jai Ho\\". Entitled \\"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\\", and credited to \\"A. R. Rahman and the Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger\\", the song appeared on the re-release of the group's second studio album Doll Domination (2008). After watching Slumdog Millionaire, record executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine wanted to turn \\"Jai Ho\\" into a \\"pop record without deviating from the original melody\\". After getting a green-light from Rahman, they asked Scherzinger, the leader singer of the Pussycat Dolls, to write an interpretation of the song. Scherzinger was hesitant at first, stating in an interview that: \\"[...] I was scared to death to touch it [and] afraid for people to hear it before I even wrote it\\". Scherzinger put her \\"heart into writing the lyrics and put in themes from the film Slumdog Millionaire. Love and destiny were elements from the movie that she put into the track\\". She stated that she \\"prayed every night to do this right\\". Fair and Iovine additionally hired Brick & Lace, The Writing Camp and Ester Dean to write their own interpretation of the song. E. Kidd Bogart, a member of The Writing Camp, stated that: \\"They [Fair and Iovine] wanted to get a bunch of different versions to see who could nail a version for the Pussycat Dolls\\". Once all interpretations were complete, \\"they [Fair and Iovine] took parts of The Writing Camp version, parts of Ester Dean's version, and parts of another version, and they put them together, and then Nicole [Scherzinger] and Ron [Fair] filled in the blanks that they thought were missing\\". Bogart additionally stated that it was \\"a very unique and awkward way of writing a song\\". Bogart, Dean, Fair, Erika Nuri, David Quiñones, Scherzinger, Candace Thorbourne, Nailah Thorbourne and Nyanda Thorbourne are credited for writing the track, while its production was handled by Fair Scherzinger. The song was recorded in London, while Scherzinger and Rahman corresponded via webcam. Music critics responded generally favorably to \\"Jai Ho (You Are My Destiny)\\". Newsround praised the song by saying \\"[Nicole Scherzinger] sounds right at home – making the most of her soulful R&B; voice and hitting all the (incredibly) high notes on this Eastern-themed piece of pop!\\" Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote that, \\"The Hindi original, which soundtracks the Bollywood dance routine at the end of the movie, is far more urgent and atmospheric, but this remake works nicely enough as a slick, shamelessly opportunistic PCD single. Well, that hollered \\"JAI HO!\\" makes for a pretty sweet pop hook, you have to admit\\".

The case was remanded for resentencing to undo the overly broad prohibition against conception.

Volk, 514 N.W.2d 424, 424+, 181 Wis.2d 369, 369+ (Wis.App. Dec 08,1993)  Background  Ruby Pointer was convicted of child endangerment and violation of a child custody decree; the trial court sentenced her to one year in county jail and five years of probation, including a condition that she must not conceive children during her probation. Pointer adhered to a rigorously disciplined macrobiotic diet that excluded all meat and dairy products, as well as many vegetables.Pointer, 151 Cal.App.3d at 1131 She was a single mother and imposed this diet on her young children as well, disregarding contrary warnings from a physician.Pointer, 151 Cal.App.3d at 1132. In October 1980, the father of one of the children contacted California's Children's Protective Services, who sent a social worker to meet with the boys and their mother. The state agency instructed Pointer to meet with a pediatrician to discuss the obvious malnourishment of the children, but Pointer declined to do so. A month later, Pointer brought one of the children to a doctor, who observed the child was in the throes of starvation - emaciated, semicomatose, and in a state of shock, and in immediate need of hospitalization. When Pointer refused intravenous feeding of the child, the pediatrician contacted the police, who hospitalized the child and saved his life.Id. As soon as the child was discharged from the hospital, Pointer took her children and fled to Puerto Rico. The FBI located her there several months later and arrested her.Pointer, 151 Cal.App.3d at 1133. Pointer was charged and found guilty by jury of violation of California Penal Code sections 273 (felony child endangerment), and 278.5 (observance of child custody decree).Id. She was sentenced to five years probation on the condition that she serve one year in county jail; participate in counseling; not be informed of the whereabouts of Jamal, her younger son, and have no unsupervised visits with him; have no child custody of her children, without prior court approval; and that she not conceive during the probationary period.Id. The California Court of Appeal affirmed all conditions of the sentence, except for the last one, the prohibition to conceive. Pointer challenged this condition as an unconstitutional restriction of her fundamental rights to privacy and to procreate.Pointer, 151 Cal.App.3d at 1136-41. The Court found the condition reasonable because the condition was related to the crime for which she was convicted;Pointer, 151 Cal.App.3d at 1138. even so, it held that it infringed on the fundamental right of privacy protected by both the federal and California state constitutions.Pointer, 151 Cal.App.3d at 1139-40. The Court concluded that the condition prohibiting Pointer from procreating during her probationary period was overbroad and that other less restrictive alternatives were available to the trial judge. The case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing consistent with the Court's views. George Deukmejian was the lead prosecutor in this important appeal before becoming Governor of California.Pointer, 151 Cal.App.3d at 1131.

It has been called one of the most impressive buildings from the Middle Ages in the area.. Built as a military fortress by Yblet de Challant in the fourteenth century, it was one of the first examples of a castle constructed as a single structure rather than as a series of buildings enclosed in a circuit wall.. The castle stands on a rocky promonitory on the opposite side of the Dora Baltea from Issogne Castle. The castle dominates the town of Verrès and the access to the Val d'Ayas. From the outside it looks like an austere cube, thirty metres long on each side and practically free of decorative elements. History =Origins= Portrait of Yblet de Challant The earliest documents attesting the existence of a castle at Verrès (in the possession of the De Verretio family) date to 1287.. At that time, control of the area was contested between the Bishop of Aosta and some noble families which were vassals of the Counts of Savoy: the De Turrilia, De Arnado, and De Verretio.. The De Verretio in particular had harsh disagreements with the prelate over the years, which culminated in the episcopal casaforte in Issogne in 1333.. Around the middle of the fourteenth century, the De Verretio became extinct without leaving any possible heirs, so their property came into the possession of the counts of Savoy, who granted it to Yblet de Challant in 1372 as a reward for diverse duties discharged in their service.Yblet had already gained the lands of the De Arnado and De Turrilia by hereditary succession. The former in fact had left their holdings to Ebal de Challant at the end of the thirteenth century, while the propert of the De Turrilia had been entrusted to Pierre de Challant-Chatillon by the counts of Savoy in the first half of the fourteenth century: Omar Borettaz, Verrès et son château: sei secoli di storia, 1390-1990 : atti della tavola rotonda pp. 24–25. Yblet entirely rebuilt the castle, producing a fortress that was practically impenetrable and distinct from most of the contemporary castles of the region which consisted of a number of buildings surrounded by a circuit wall. An inscription in Latin on the architrave of the first gate as one approaches from the plain records the completion of Yblet's work in 1390: =Fifteenth century= At the death of Yblet in 1409, the castle and his other possessions passed to his son François de Challant, who received the title of first Count of Challant from Amadeus VIII the Duke of Savoy on 15 August 1424. Verrès remained one of his most important properties, but he did not alter the castle in any substantial way.. François died in 1442 without male heirs and left his property to his daughters Marguerite and Catherine. Verrès castle thus became the centre of an inheritance dispute between Catherine who claimed it for herself under her father's will and some of her male cousins, including Jacques de Challant who contested the will on the basis of the Salic law, which did not permit succession in the female line. Verrès became one of the strongholds of Catherine and her husband Pierre Sarriod d'Introd during this conflict with Jacques. Legend has it that, on Trinity Sunday 1449 Catherine and Pierre left the castle and went down to the town square, where they danced with the youth of the town. This noticeably increased the populace's support for Catherine and is reenacted annually in the historic carnival of Verrès.. In 1456, after the death of her husband in an ambush, Catherine was forced to surrender herself and her property, including the estate and castle of Verrès, which passed to Jacques de Challant who became the second count of Challant.. =The sixteenth century fortress= Inscription above the entrance to the castle's vestibule The castle followed the vicissitudes of the descendants of Jacques thereafter, passing first to his son Louis, then to his nephew Philibert and then to Philibert's son René, who restored the more comfortable castle at Issogne and made that his residence. Since its construction by Yblet about a hundred and fifty years earlier, the castle had not received any particular renovations or maintenance work. In 1536, René renovated the fortress to take account of the appearance of firearms, with the help of the Spanish captain Pietro de Valle, a famous military architect. He had the base of the cubic structure surrounded by a circuit wall with counterforts and polygonal turrets, adapted to cope with cannons and equipped with pieces of artillery brought from his fief of Valangin in Switzerland. René must also be responsible for the current vestibule, accessed by a drawbridge, for new windows and for new gates with Moorish arches.Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, pp. 23–24. The construction work is recorded on a stone inscription above the entrance to the vestibule, accompanied by the arms of René de Challant (on the left of the text) and those of his second wife Mencia de Braganza (on the right):Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, p. 39. =Decline and recovery in the nineteenth century= Verrès castle in a nineteenth century engraving by Celestino Turletti At Rene de Challant's death without male heirs in 1565, his property passed to his son-in-law Giovanni Federico Madruzzo who was married to his daughter Isabel, beginning a long legal conflict with other male members of the Challant family, once again based on the Salic law, under which Isabel could not inherity her father's property. Therefore, the House of Savoy took direct control of Verrès castle, turning it into a look out and military garrison, but in 1661 Duke Charles Emmanuel II had the armaments of the castle dismantled and transferred (along with those of Saint-Germain Castle) to Fort Bard, which was in a more strategic position for control of Valle d'Aosta. Verrès was abandoned..Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, p. 30.. In 1696, the legal dispute between the heirs of Isabel de Challant and the Challant family finally came to an end and the castle returned to the Challant family. The castle remained their property until the extinction of their house in the nineteenth century, but it was no longer inhabited and fell into ruin. The strong exterior walls held up well, but the wooden roof was removed as punishment for not paying taxes, leaving the top floor exposed to the elements. After a series of transfersthe Challant family went extinct with the death of Francesco Maurizio Gregorio in 1796 and his son Giulio Giacinto in 1802. Gabriella Canalis di Cumiana, widow of Francesco Maurizio Gregorio was married to Amédée-Louis Passerin d'Entrèves who became the new owner of Verrès and Issogne castles (as well as other manors) after her death. Later the two manors were sold to Alexandre Gaspard di Châtillon and from him to the Baron Marius de Vautheleret. In 1872 Marius de Vautheleret had to sell the two castles to pay his debts: Issogne was acquired by the painter Vittorio Avondo and Verrès by countess Paolina Crotti di Castigliole who sold it to Alfredo d'Andrade in 1894. See ; Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, pp.33-34. it was finally acquired from Alfredo d'Andrade in 1894 by the Italian state in 1894 and placed under the Superintendency for monuments of Piedmont and Liguria, which carried out restoration work.The restorations, begun by d'Andrade and later continued by Cesare Bertea until the interwar period, mainly concerned with the removal of plants that had grown between the walls, reconstruction of the merlons, the chimneys, the doors and windows and replacing the roof: Maria Cristina Ronc, Verrès et son château: sei secoli di storia, 1390–1990: atti della tavola rotonda, pp. 68–74. After the Second World War, the castle was declared a Monument of Italy and came under the authority of the Regione Valle d'Aosta which rebuilt the stone casing in the 1980s. A final restoration was undertaken in 1994. In 2004 the castle was closed to allow strengthening and adjustment of the structure. Since it was reopened in 2007 it has been open to guided tours.. Description Cross-section of the castle The castle, constructed as a military fortress, sits atop a rocky premonitory above the river Évançon and dominates the town of Verrès. In addition to being difficult to reach and easy to defend, its position allowed it to control the country below: the central valley and the Val d'Ayas pass which was then an important route. In the eighteenth century, the Aostan historian Jean-Baptiste de Tillier wrote about the castle, saying: Externally it is an austere cube, about 30 metres on each side, surrounded at the base by a circuit wall which encircles the entire summit of the peak. The walls (some more than 2.5 metres thick). are surmounted by a continuous line of battlements, which hide a storm drain, with Medieval mullioned and Renaissance cruciformed windows. =Entrance= The entrance, on the way up from the vestibule Every element of the castle seems to have been considered to make the fortress more defensible. The visitor ascends on foot along a mule track, which winds up the mountain until it reaches the entrance in the circuit wall, accessed by means of a drawbridge. This entrance, like the external circuit wall, was built by Rene de Challant in the sixteenth century, as indicated by the inscription above the gate.Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, pp. 39–40. As the visitor follows the path up to the castle, the fortress is always on his right side. This was another defensive feature, since the soldiers of the time usually carried their shield in their left hand and therefore the right side was exposed.Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, p. 38. Beyond the gate there is a vestibule with a curving stairway to make it difficult to use a battering ram. In this space there is a door which leads to an inner compound, once occupied by the stables, and to the ramparts -not accessible to visitors. Above the vestibule is the gatehouse, on top of the dungeon and now the location of the ticket office for visitors to the manor. Its front is the true entrance to the castle - a round arch and a pointed arch with a wooden door reinforced by nails in imitation of the original door. =Ground floor= The weighty staircase which occupies the centre of Verrès castle (photo from the beginning of the twentieth century) Inside the castle is a square entrance hall roofed by a vault of pointed arches, a further defensive element. Several loopholes look into the hall and there is a trapdoor in the ceiling from which it would have been possible to bombard any invaders trapped inside.Giuseppe Giacosa, I castelli Valdostani pp. 161-162. In order to actually enter the core of the manor it is necessary to pass through a double door with a round arch on the side facing into the entrance hall and a pointed arch on the side facing the inner courtyard - once protected by a portcullis separating the two doors.Anna Maria Ferrero, pp. 40-41. Plan of the ground floor: The inner courtyard of the castle is a simple square area from which two large halls, positioned on the east and west sides of the manor, can be accessed. The courtyard is open to the sky, allowing greater illumination of the rooms and the collection of rainwater in the grand cistern located below it. The pavement of the courtyard is sloped so that all the water converges at the centre, where there is an opening into the cistern. This reserve supply of water would be precious in the event of a siege.Anna Maria Ferrero, p. 41. The internal division of the castle is as simple as its exterior appearance. The ground floor is composed of three rooms in addition to the entrance hall, which surround the inner courtyard. The entire eastern side of the castle is occupied by a large rectangular room covered by a round barrel vault. This was the only unheated room of the castle and most likely served as a warehouse and armoury. It is used as a ballroom during the annual celebration of the historic carnival. On the opposite side is the large west hall, accessed by means of a gateway and covered by a pointed barrel vault. This hall, probably used for housing and dining by the soldiers and service personal, was heated by two massive fireplaces and connected to the kitchen on the south side of the ground floor by a serving hatch and to the kitchen on the northwest of the floor above by a staircase.Anna Maria Ferrero, pp. 42–43. A loophole looks into the entrance hall from this room. At some points here, the rocky ground pokes through: the castle is actually built into the naked rockAnna Maria Ferrero, p. 43. and it would have been impossible to the remove the aforementioned rocks without compromising the structure's stability. =First floor= Detail of a mullioned window on the first floor The first floor was reserved for the lord of the manor. It is reached by climbing up the monumental stairway on flying buttresses extending about two metres from the courtyard walls, which climb up the internal walls of the building.Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, p. 40\\"Tersilia Gatto Chanu, Guida insolita ai misteri, ai segreti, alle leggende e alle curiosità della Valle d'Aosta. The architrave of the first door which a person first meets as they climb the staircase bears the inscription which records that Yblet de Challant built the castle in 1390. The door itself leads to a room used as a gatehouse, which is located above the entrance hall. In the floor there is the trapdoor which allows bombardment of enemies in the room below.Anna Maria Ferrero, p. 46. The room is lit by a window on the north side, through which it is possible to see Villa Castle in Challand-Saint-Victor. Plan of the first floor: A second kitchen for the garrison is accessed from this room, once connected to the hall on the ground floor by a staircase. The room is provided with a hatch which opens into the void on the northern side of the castle, like the rooms above and below - perhaps a form of secret escape route. The room also has a pantry in the wall, with a hole to allow the cold from outside to better conserve the food, and a fireplace in the wall which is shared with the lord's dining room, which had the double function of cooking the food and warming the adjacent room. From the kitchen there is access to the room which served as the lord's dining room (also accessible from the staircase in the courtyard). This room occupied the rest of the waestern part of the floor. The hall was heated by two large brasiers located in the corners and was connected to the kitchen on the north side of the castle by a hatch. The room was lit from the outside by mullioned gothic windows and from the courtyard by a fourteenth century quadrifora window. The lord's kitchen, located on the south side of the floor has three large fireplaces. The one on the side opposite the courtyard is of exceptional size and was originally designed to cook whole animals inside it. The room is covered by several ribbed vaults from the time of Rene de Challant, which have his coat of arms and the letters R and M (the initials of Rene and his wife Mencia) at the centre.Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, 45. This is the only part of the castle's roofing which is original - the rest was restored in the twentieth century. The eastern side of the kitchen is taken up by some cupboards on the wall and by a large pantry built into the wall. The east side of this floor is taken up by the lord's bedrooms, heated by large stone fireplaces, covered by a cofferred wooden ceiling and equipped with a total of five latrines in the wall, which emptied onto the rocks below. = Second floor = Detail of the corbels and machicolations which extend from the walls The second floor of the bastion, which cannot be visited on the guided tour, replicates the division of the first floor and was probably used by functionaries and guests of the castle. Above the lord's dining hall is a hall, probably used at some point as a council hall. The wooden roof and stone fireplace of this hall, like those in the other rooms on this floor, were reconstructed and restored in the last few decades. They had been ruined by the weathering, to which they were exposed after the removal of the manor's roof. The rooms on the east side have two latrines like those on the first floor. The room above the kitchen in the northwest corner contains a hatch leading to a ledge on the outside, possibly used as a service exit or perhaps for signalling.Anna Maria Ferrero, La rocca di Verrès, pp. 46–48. Wooden stairs, completely reconstructed, connect this floor to the attic. The rooms of the attic are subdivided in the same way as the floors below and were probably used by the soldiers and servants of the castle and for storing rocks. Going out from the attic, it is possible to access the Chemin de ronde which runs around the outside of the four sides of the building for about 120 metres and contains 148 machicolations. Going inwards there is a wooden gallery which faces the interior courtyard and whose roofing serves to drain rainwater into the courtyard. The stone roof was completely reconstructed in the 1980s.  Verrès Castle in popular culture  Verrès Castle is one of the most visited monuments of the Aosta Valley. Between 2007 and 2009 it had around 20,000 visitors every year. In 1884, the manor was used by Alfredo d'Andrade as one of his models for the Medieval Castle and Rock in Turin, which was built for the Italian General Artistic and Industrial Exhibition of that year. Every year since 1949, on the occasion of the historic carnival, the people of Verrès celebrate the 31 May 1449, when Catherine de Challant and her husband Pierre d'Introd went down to the village square and began to dance with the townsmen. For the four days of the carnival, the castle hosts dinners, Masquerade balls, and performance of Giuseppe Giacosa's play, Una Partita a Scacchi (A Game of Chess).

Early life Darboux was born to a noble Djougou family on May 10, 1919. He soon became an important merchant, and a power base rapidly grew around him, among the Dendi and Wangara peoples of the north. He had ambitions on the Dahomeyan political scene, and helped finance Hubert Maga's deputy campaigns.. Political career In the legislative elections of June 17, 1951, when Dahomey was allowed an additional representative in the French National Assembly, Maga ran for that office. As per a May 1951 electoral law, each candidate had to give the name of another who would occupy the second seat in the event that the other party's first candidate came in third or below.. Maga decided to run with Darboux, and won the election.. He founded his own political party, the Défense des Intérêts Économiques, in 1956. This would occasionally go under the names of Union des Indépendants du Dahomey or Independents du Nord during his long political career. In the 1957 territorial assembly elections, he narrowly won the district of Djougou and gained himself a seat. Darboux allied with Sourou-Migan Apithy, and was rewarded with the post of Minister of Labor and Social Affairs in Apithy's government of 1958. The new minister owned the trade union Syndicat des Commerçants Africains du Dahomomey, which he used to advance his political aspirations. President Hubert Maga retained Darboux in his administration from 1960 to 1963 as Minister of Economics and Commerce. He gained power in the Atakora region and hatred in Djougou. On October 28, 1963, Chief of Staff of the 800-man Dahomeyan Army Christophe Soglo overthrew Maga and established his own regime.. In its wake, Darboux was imprisoned for mishandling fiscal resources. His whereabouts were unknown until 1970, when he campaigned for Maga in the upcoming election. When a Presidential Council form of government was established that year, Darboux was voted president of the Assemblée Consultative Nationale,. a consultative assembly. After the October 1972 coup, the Assemblée was dismissed..

It is one of four dams on the Toccoa/Ocoee River owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the early 1940s to meet emergency demands for electricity during World War II. The dam impounds the Ocoee No. 3 Reservoir, which stretches upriver to the Tennessee-Georgia state line.Tennessee Valley Authority, Ocoee Reservoir No. 3. Retrieved: 23 January 2009. Ocoee No. 3's powerhouse is actually located several miles downstream from the dam, and is fed by a conduit that carries water to it from the reservoir.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Hiwassee Valley Projects Volume 2: The Apalachia, Ocoee No. 3, Nottely, and Chatuge Projects, Technical Report No. 5 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1948), pp. 1-13, 40, 47, 63, 295, 494. Location Ocoee Dam No. 3 is located above the mouth of the Ocoee River, where the river slices a deep gap between Little Frog Mountain to the north and Big Frog Mountain to the south. Both of these mountains are protected by federal wilderness areas which are adjacent to TVA's Ocoee No. 3 reservation boundary. Ocoee Dam No. 2 is just downstream, and Blue Ridge Dam is upstream. The Toccoa River, which flows down from its source in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northern Georgia, enters Tennessee (where it becomes the Ocoee River) approximately upstream from Ocoee Dam No. 3, near the Copperhill area. The Ocoee Scenic Byway which is part of U.S. Route 64 passes just north of the dam.

The powerhouse of Ocoee No. 3 was built downstream from the dam in order to obtain maximum utilization of the elevation loss along this stretch of the river. A high pressure conduit most of which flows through a by tunnel carved into the mountainside carries the water from the reservoir at a relatively steady elevation. The water emerges from the tunnel at a point from the reservoir intake and drops through a steel penstock to the powerhouse's lone turbine. Background and construction TVA's design plan for Ocoee No. 3, circa 1941 The rapid-flowing Ocoee River's hydroelectric potential has been exploited by private interests, namely the Eastern Tennessee Power Company and its successor, the Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCO), since the completion of Ocoee Dam No. 1 in late 1911. While only a stretch of river remained between Ocoee Dam No. 2 (completed in 1913) and Blue Ridge Dam (completed in 1931), this stretch's average elevation loss of per mile made a third dam possible. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had surveyed the Ocoee No. 3 dam site in the late 1920s, and TEPCO had already purchased the necessary land and water rights for the dam by the 1930s. The TVA Act of 1933 created the Tennessee Valley Authority and gave the Authority oversight of the entire Tennessee River watershed, which includes the Ocoee. In 1939, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling forced TEPCO to sell TVA its assets, which included the tract for Ocoee No. 3. While TVA identified the Ocoee No. 3 site as part of its Hiwassee Valley surveys in 1934, the idea for the dam received little attention until the outbreak of World War II in Europe sparked a need for increased aluminum production at the ALCOA plant in Alcoa, Tennessee, which required large amounts of electricity. The Ocoee No. 3 project, along with several other dam projects in the Hiwassee watershed, was authorized on July 16, 1941. Construction began the following day. Most of the land necessary for the construction of Ocoee Dam No. 3 and its reservoir had been obtained from TEPCO, and thus no residential or cemetery relocations were necessary. Work progressed at a steady pace, and the dam was completed on August 15, 1942. The diversion tunnel was completed in November of the same year, but budget delays prevented the dam's generator from becoming operational until April 30, 1943. =January 2009 sludge release= On January 4, 2009, TVA released a substantial amount of contaminated sludge-like material from the Ocoee No. 3 Reservoir into the Upper Ocoee immediately downstream, killing an undetermined number of fish and covering the river with a layer of \\"foul-smelling\\" sludge as far downstream as the Ocoee No. 2 Reservoir. The sludge was filled with contaminants including copper, iron, and zinc left over from the mining operations that once denuded the Ducktown Basin, which is adjacent to the Ocoee No. 3 reservoir. The release polluted the Ocoee Whitewater Center, which is two miles (3 km) downstream from Ocoee Dam No. 3.Scott Barker, \\"TVA Probed in Ocoee Release .\\" Knoxnews.com, 14 January 2009. Retrieved: 28 January 2009. TVA stated that the release was part of routine maintenance in anticipation of rain showers. The material was released via the dam's sluice gates, which are located at the bottom of the dam and are typically used for low-level and recreational releases. On January 12, 2009, in response to the incident, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation issued a notice of violation that ordered TVA to get state approval before using the dam's sluice gates, restore the affected areas, and submit a management plan for sluicing operations at the dam.

West 8 is an urban planning and landscape architecture firm founded by Adriaan Geuze and Paul van Beek in Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1987. It is known for its contemporary designs and innovative solutions to urban planning problems using lighting, metal structures, and color. Van Beek is no longer part of the firm. Geuze founded West 8 in 1987 in Rotterdam with Paul van Beek, who later left the firm. Geuze won the Dutch Maaskant Award for young architects in 1987 and the firm grew to employ more than 75 architects and planners, with offices in Rotterdam and New York City. The firm has produced several striking designs and is part of a wave of Dutch architects doing major works that have received international attention and recognition for novel design approaches. Background Schouwburgplein, Rotterdam Geuze was born in Dordrecht in 1960 and graduated with a degree in landscape architecture from the University of Wageningen in 1987. Geuze's 1993 essay \\"Accelerating Darwin\\" advocated a \\"sensation of spontaneous culture which the city dweller creates\\". One of the firm's best known projects is the Schouwburgplein in Rotterdam (1996) using a raised platform lit from below and incorporating crane like structure to support lights that can be moved by inserting coins in a slot, \\"literally empowering the individual to light the square as they see fit.\\" At the Oosterscheldedam Flood Barrier (1994) the firm used black and white striped mussel shells as art and landscape, and at the Carrascoplein in Amsterdam (1998) they converted a \\"forgotten place\\" beneath viaducts into a parking lot of abstract patterns with patches of green space with illumination of the viaduct soffits creating a \\"Ballardian urban park.\\" West 8 developed masterplans for the Ypenburg Vinex showing that they can \\"marshal large plots and world-class architects with assurance\\", and produced a provocative design with palm trees in the sky plan for Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena, in 2002, and won a 2003 competition for an urban plan in Tromsø, Norway. West 8 became known in Europe for their ecological spatial planning and landscape projects. Ahead of time, their approach based on the environment reality was awarded a Global Award for Sustainable Architecture in 2014. Projects The Whale housing project West 8's urban planning projects include striking new conceptions, such as the Schouwburgplein in Rotterdam, a large public square made of a lightweight metal structure which \\"floats\\" on top of the roof of a parking garage. Geuze has been credited with having \\"almost single-handedly re-established landscape on the agenda of Dutch urbanism and is now taking his influence global in designing open spaces in or around buildings by most of the best Dutch contemporary architects.\\" West 8 brings landscape architecture into city planning in a functionalist and pragmatic way; since the distinction between town and country in places like the Netherlands has largely disappeared, novel ideas for landscape use are often called for by city planners to fulfill the needs of modern urbanites. In the Netherlands, they are responsible for masterplanning a large-scale low-rise residential development on two peninsulas comprising the formerly dilapidated Borneo Sporenburg, part of the eastern harbor area of Amsterdam, as well as for the bicycle bridges and footbridges leading to the area. The Simcoe wavedeck nearing completion on Toronto's waterfront West 8 have produced several highly original bridges designs for bridges including the so-called \\"Reptile Bridge\\" proposal for a connection between Leidsche Rijn and Utrecht, and the helical truss Vlaardingse Vaart Bridge in Vlaardingen,. a finalist for the Dutch Design Awards in 2009.. Their design for a pedestrian bridge in Amsterdam was nominated for the 2001 Design Prize of the city of Rotterdam. Most recently, they won a design competition for a bridge across a railroad in Aarschot, Belgium. Undulating wave shapes are also part of West 8's designs, with DTAH, for a series of wavedecks on Toronto's waterfront. The wooden planked walkways are part of a redevelopment project known as Waterfront Toronto. The first three of the four planned wavedecks, Rees wavedeck, Spadina wavedeck, and Simcoe wavedeck, have been completed. In the United States, West 8 have gained a reputation for unorthodox design proposals, such as their proposal to fill in the World Trade Center site and turn it into a pasture. They were finalists for the design of the new exterior for the New York Aquarium, and were part of the team of firms that won the design contest for an ambitious park (including free bicycles) on the southern half of Governors Island in New York.

Chhantyals are considered an indigenous group by the Government of Nepal. Most of the Chhantyal dwellings are concentrated in the western part of the country. Baglung and Myagdi are two districts in the Dhaulagiri Zone where most of the Chhantyals are living. Other districts with Chhantyal habitation include Mustang, Gulmi, Rukum, and Parbat. Nowadays, owing to the migration trend there is a notable population of the Chhantyals in Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Rupandehi, Kaski, Dang and Chitwan districts. According to a survey conducted by its sole organization, Nepal Chhantyal Organization, the total population is 16,093 and 1,602 households . Traditionally Chhantyals have been living with other castes in harmony. In some villages Chhantyals are a major group whereas in other villages they are a minority. Chhantyals have their own culture, tradition, rituals, language, and religion. Most of the Chhantyal’s major occupation is farming. Foreign remittance also plays a vital role. British and Indian Gurkha army, gulf countries, Malaysia, Japan, USA, Australia and Europe have been some of the destination for foreign employment in recent years. As a matter of faith, Chhantyals worship nature and their ancestor's spirits. They give animal sacrifices on trees, hills, sources of water and other special places like farms and at the altar inside a house etc. Some of the gods include Barah, Kuldebata, Sime Bhume, Mandali etc. Because of Hinduism's overwhelming pressure in the 19th century, Chhantyals have adopted a mixed worshiping style. Maghe-Sankranti and Saune-Sankranti are two major festivals. These two festivals have special importance on nature and ancestor's spirit worship. Dashain and Tihar, Hindu's major festivals, are also celebrated as special occasions. Chhantyals are formed of twelve different clans which are as follow: Bhalanja [भलंजा], Budhathoki [बुढाथोकी, Dandamare [डांडामारे], Gharabja [घरब्जा], Gharti [घर्ती], Gyapchan [घ्याप्चन], Jhingraja [झिङराजा], Khadka [खड्का], Potlange [पोट्लाङ्गे], Purane [पुराने], Singe [सिङे], and Tathapja [तथप्जा].Traditionally they marry inside their twelve clans. One of the major distinct characteristics of the community is the marriage tradition. Cousin marriage is allowed but has to be outside one's own clan. Language The Chhantyals’ language known as Chhantyal Kham (छन्त्याल खाम) is moribund. Most of the Chhantyals in Baglung have ceased to speak Chhantyal Kham many years ago. Some efforts have been made but the goal to preserve it is somewhat far from current efforts. The main problem with Chhantyal Kham is that there is no written alphabet. Some words and expressions are akin to the (Tamu) Gurung Kham language, but these two are separate Khams with distinct identity and history. The Chhantyal language is spoken by approximately 5,000 of the about 15,000 ethnic Chantyals. The villages where the Chantyal language is spoken are all located in the eastern portion of the Myagdi District and include the villages of Mangale Khani, Dwari, Ghyas Kharka‚, Chaura Khani, Kuine Khani, Thada Khani, Patle Kharka‚ Malhampar, and Malkabang. There is relatively little linguistic variation among these villages. The Chhantyal language is a member of the Tamangic group (along with Gurung, Thakali, Nar- Phu and Tamang) Within the group, it is lexically and grammatically closest to Thakali.

The Wertheim brand name is sold in Australia and New Zealand exclusively through Godfreys. Post by Magic7 Post by TruthOutThere  History of Wertheim in Australia  The Wertheim brand was established in Australia in the early 1900s when German sewing machine manufacturer Hugo Wertheim moved to Melbourne with his partner. The brand achieved considerable success selling sewing machines, pianos and other electrical goods constructed of mainly Australian materials. The Australian Wertheim factory was closed in 1935 and was later turned into a Heinz factory and later re-purposed as a television studio for GTV Channel 9. Shortly after, the brand was acquired by Australian retail company Godfreys, who continued selling sewing machines and vacuum cleaners under the 'Wertheim' brand, although manufactured by the Singer Company in Italy. The first Wertheim Vacuum released by Godfreys in the Australian market in 1988 was the TB1200. The TB1200 had an optional extra of a Powerbrush (PB1). The vacuum was fitted with a suction sensor that increased the suction as the restriction of airflow increased. After the initial success of this model, other models soon followed including the CT1000 and the RT1000. These were smaller machines designed to be lighter than the TB1200. The 1300i was released in the early 1990s, this model had a suction control feature on the handle. The first generation of machines including the TB1200, CT1000 and RT1000 were manufactured by the Singer company in Italy. Later models such as the 3830, 4030, 5030, 6030, 6035 and W7000 were produced in conjunction with Electrolux first in their Swedish factory, then in their Hungarian factory. The current generation models are now all made in China, with the last of the European models being the W7000. In 2015, Wertheim sought a new manufacturer for their W2000 Dog & Cat and SE9500 models, whilst being Chinese made - these units have proved to be a success for the brand in regards to overall reliability and customer satisfaction. In August 2017, Wertheim released the W900 Series 7 model, a powerful bagged unit which features a Whirlwind Power Pulse power brush, with independent tests proving the unit picks up a substantial 36% more dust and dirt from carpets than the best selling bagless vacuum cleaner on the market.  Past Reliability Problems  There has been active discussion online about reliability problems of many of the previous Wertheim models on review and discussion websites such as Whirlpool , Not Good Enough and ProductReview.com.au Wertheim sought out a new manufacturer for their units in early 2015 with the release of the W2000 and W2500 models, whilst not manufactured in Europe like previous models, these units have proved to be a success for the brand in terms of customer satisfaction and reliability.
