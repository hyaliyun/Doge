As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has pale green and white-striped flowers, similar to those of another New Zealand greenhood, P. trullifolia but are larger and paler in colour. Description Pterostylis alobula is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of mostly egg-shaped leaves, long and long with a stalk up to long. Flowering plants usually have a single pale green flower with white stripes high borne on a flowering stem up to high with between two and six linear to lance-shaped stem leaves long and wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column with its tip usually horizontal. The lateral sepals are erect, held closely against the galea and have a broad V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is red, curved and projects above the sinus. Flowering occurs from March to October. Taxonomy and naming The winter greenhood was first formally described in 1968 by Edwin Hatch and given the name Pterostylis trullifolia var. alobula. The description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand. In 1968 it was raised to species status by Lucy Moore. The specific epithet (alobula) is derived from the Latin word lobus meaning \\"an elongated projection or protuberance\\", \\"capsule\\" or \\"pod\\" with the prefix a- meaning \\"without\\". Distribution and habitat The winter greenhood usually grows in sparse leaf litter under shrubs in forest but sometimes also in scrub or pasture.

The school holds a special emphasis on languages. Miina H√§rma Gymnasium is an IB World School offering the Diploma Programme and the Primary Years Programme, and a candidate school for the Middle Years Programme.  History  Oskar Kallas, one of the school's founders and its first director. After the Estonian national awakening had ended the Estonian people were still left under the supremacy of German language and culture. This meant that the upper class mostly spoke German. The first generation of ethnic Estonian intellectuals, who were mostly men, did not stop using Estonian language but were educated primarily in the German language. At the beginning of the 20th century Estonian intellectuals such as Jakob Hurt, Oskar Kallas, Jaan T√µnisson and many others decided to tackle the problem by founding a secondary school for girls. In order to obtain a permission to do that an association had to be started. This association was established in the year 1906 and was the Estonian Youth Education Association (Estonian: Eesti Noorsoo Kasvatuse Selts; abbreviated as ENKS). The opening ceremony of the school was held on 1 September 1906 by the Julian calendar and it was named Estonian Youth Education Association's Secondary School for Girls. Its first director was Oskar Kallas, the second Peeter P√µld.  School building  Despite having the plan to build its own school house from the start, the school spent its early years moving from place to place. It was caused by the unanticipated costs of building a suitable school house and political conflicts. A contest was run in Finland to design a suitable building for the school, but the winning design turned out to be too costly. Thus, it was adjusted by the engineers Aleksander Raudsepp and Fromhold Kangro to fit the budget of financiers. The cornerstone of the school house was installed on 1 June 1914 according to the project of Georg Hellat. A year later the school building was complete, but the school was unable to move in due to the beginning of World War I. Instead of letting the school to move in, the authorities decided to place there the Austrian prisoners of war. In the year 1917 it was occupied by a military hospital. A year later the German military took possession of the building. Shortly after the communists did the same. It was only in the year of 1921 that the school was finally able to move into its designated building. Since the school operated several years without a building of its own, it had to rent rooms in a number of places. The first year was spent in 24 Jaani St. after which they moved to 74 Tiigi St. In spite of the unfavorable conditions for studying the school operated there until the year 1915. The school was moved out of there in hope of finally moving into its newly built schoolhouse. Unfortunately, they could not do that. The school found shelter at the commercial school of 6 Fortuuna St., the business school of H. Margens and 12 Holmi St. In the year 1919 the whole school moved to the building of Hugo Treffner Gymnasium in R√º√ºtli St. Finally, in the year 1921 they succeeded in moving into their own school building. In 1944, the school was named the Tartu City Secondary School No. 2. In 1954, the school was reorganized into a coeducational school for girls and boys. In 1964, in conjunction with Estonian composer, and choir director Miina H√§rma's 100th birthday, the school was renamed the Miina H√§rma Gymnasium.  Curriculum  Miina H√§rma, the school's namesake since 1964. Miina H√§rma Gymnasium serves students from form 1 to 12. Students can enter based on an entrance exam, which is taken in the spring of each year. Students who have reached the final round in a national olympiad are not required to take the entrance test. Although the school has aptitude for languages, it still lets students pick from four departments: social, humanities, life sciences and IB programme. The choice of departments starts to matter from the 11th form. In addition the school provides a wide variety of extracurricular activities such as choir and folk dancing.  International Studies  Together with the Ministry of Education and Research and Tartu City Government, Miina H√§rma Gymnasium is preparing to implement the continuum of International Baccalaureate programmes (Primary Years, Middle Years and Diploma) to serve the educational needs of children who temporarily visit Tartu and neighbouring counties due to their parents' mobility. Implementing the IBO programmes takes a couple of years of preparatory work, at the end of which the school is officially authorised by the IBO. Miina H√§rma Gymnasium has gained authorisation to teach the Diploma Programme (for students aged 16‚Äì19) and the Primary Years Programme (for students aged 7‚Äì11). It is in the candidacy phase for the Middle Years Programme, estimated time of authorisation is in 2018. In the academic year 2016/17, MYP grades 1-2 are opened, in the academic year MYP grades 3-4 follow. No tuition fee is charged in the IB Programmes, in the candidacy phase the implementation of the IB pedagogy is in process.  Newspaper  Throughout the years Miina H√§rma Gymnasium has had several different newspapers. The first was published from 1929 to 1940 and was named Karuohakas after Hans Karu, the school's headmaster during that period. It spoke of the life in school, country's history and students‚Äô creative works. In the year 1996 the newspaper H√§rmakakk was published. The current newspaper Tabula Rasa came to be in the year 1998. It means clean slate in Latin. The first publication won the prize of the best school newspaper in Estonia. In the following years it has also won many other prizes.

The school was founded in 1888 as a single-room school; four years later, its students moved into a two-story facility built for the purpose. The school's models were Tuskegee Institute and Hampton Institute, and it advocated vocational schooling, teaching such skills as farming, carpentry, blacksmithing‚Äîthe hope was that the school would be able to provide its own food and that students would contribute to white and black communities. The board that ran the school consisted of twelve people: six whites, all from out of state, and six blacks, all local, including Booker T. Washington. For all practical purposes the school in its day-to-day operation was run by African-Americans. It proved harder than expected to make the school as financially independent as was envisioned; support came through the efforts of Bowen, who proved a tireless fundraiser and got the Alabama Federation of Colored Women's Clubs to support the school. With their help additional acreage was acquired; the clubs were particularly appalled by the numbers of black young men in the area who ended up incarcerated in adult prisons, and supporting the school allowed young boys to stay out of prison‚Äîone such student was Satchel Paige. By 1908 a second institution was opened, the later state-run Mount Meigs Campus.

United States, 582 U.S. ___ (2017), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the government cannot revoke the citizenship of a naturalized U.S. citizen based on an immaterial false statement made by the citizen in their naturalization application. Background Divna Maslenjak is a Bosnian Serb native to an area of Bosnia dominated by Muslims. During the Bosnian War her husband, Ratko, was an officer in Vidoje Blagojeviƒá's brigade of the Army of Republika Srpska, units of which committed acts of genocide, including the Srebrenica massacre. In April 1998, Maslenjak met with a United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer in Belgrade to seek refugee status. There, under oath, Maslenjak falsely claimed that her husband had evaded conscription during the war by fleeing the country, and that as such the family were now subject to persecutions from both Serbs and Muslims. Maslenjak and her family were granted refugee status based on her falsehoods, and they immigrated to the United States in September 2000. ICE eventually discovered records of Ratko's war service, so in December 2006 he was arrested and charged with lying on a government document. One week later, Maslenjak filed a Form N-400 Application for Naturalization, in which she falsely stated that she had never lied to any U.S. government official. Maslenjak became a U.S. citizen on August 3, 2007. After her husband was convicted and made subject to deportation, Maslenjak filed a Form I-130 petition for her husband's asylum, and she then gave testimony admitting that she had lied about her husband's war service to gain refugee status. Maslenjak was then indicted for procuring her naturalization contrary to law in violation of . The jury was instructed that her lies did not need to have influenced her naturalization if she had violated a separate prohibition on lying to the government, . On April 17, 2014, a jury convicted Divna Maslenjak of knowingly procuring naturalization contrary to law and U.S. District Judge Benita Y. Pearson then granted the government's request to revoke Maslenjak's citizenship. On April 7, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction, in which Judge Stanley Thomas Anderson was joined by Judge David McKeague, with Julia Smith Gibbons concurring. By approving of the instructions received by the jury, the Sixth Circuit created a circuit split between itself and the First, Seventh, Ninth and Fourth Circuits. Supreme Court At oral arguments on April 26, 2017, several justices were openly critical of the government's broad reading of the statute. =Opinion of the Court= On June 22, 2017, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of the immigrant, voting unanimously to vacate and remand to the lower court. Justice Elena Kagan wrote the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. The Court adopted the ‚Äúmost natural‚Äù reading of the statutory text, which, according to the ‚Äúrules of language‚Äù implicitly required some causality between the illegal act and procuring naturalization. To make this causal link, the Court announced several objective tests juries must apply including: whether the falsehood concerned a fact that simply disqualified the immigrant for citizenship, or, whether the falsehood was both ‚Äúsufficiently relevant‚Äù to a citizenship qualification to prompt an immigration official to investigate further and that such an investigation would have predictably led to a disqualifying fact. The Court also posited that the accused could raise an affirmative defense that he is actually qualified for citizenship. The case was remanded to determine if Maslenjak had been harmed by the erroneous jury instructions. =Justice Gorsuch's concurrence in part= Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. Gorsuch agreed with the majority's interpretation of the statute, but did not approve of the new multipart test the Court announced, and he chided the majority for not waiting for lower courts to develop standards in the first instance. =Justice Alito's concurrence in the judgment= Justice Samuel Alito, alone, concurred only in the judgment. Instead of a causal requirement, Alito thought the offense included an implied materiality element, and opined that something may be material even if it does not affect an outcome. Subsequent developments After being remanded, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on October 3, 2018.

It is similar to P. parviflora but has larger rosette leaves and larger, more brightly coloured flowers.Habit in the New England National Park Description Pterostylis amabilis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of three to five bright green, broad egg-shaped leaves which lie flat on the ground. Each leaf is long and wide. Flowering plants have up to ten well-spaced flowers long and wide borne on a thin, wiry spike high. Up to five leaf rosettes are arranged on the side of the flowering spike. The flowers are bright reddish-brown and white and usually up to four are open at once. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The galea has an inflated shape near its base and rough surface. The lateral sepals are erect, held closely against the galea with thread-like tips about long that do not project as far as the top of the galea. The sinus between the bases of the lateral sepals bulges forward and curves inward at the top. The labellum is not visible from outside the intact flower.

He is remembered mostly for his fight with Marlon Starling and the controversial way in which it ended. Behind on the scorecards, Molinares launched a punch that knocked Starling out, but the punch seemingly landed just after the bell to end round six rang. Viewings of the fight's video, both by officials during a WBA inquest right after the bout and on YouTube showings, prove and have proven inconclusive as far as whether Molinares threw the punch in time or not. Professional boxing career Tomas Molinares debuted as a professional boxer on October 26, 1984, when he faced 0‚Äì1‚Äì1 Arnovis Castro at the Bernardo Caraballo Coliseum in Cartagena, winning by decision. On March 1, 1985, Molinares faced the much more experienced Cristobal Torres, who had accumulated a record of 11 wins, 10 losses and 4 draws (ties) in 25 bouts, compared to Molinares' 1‚Äì0. He stopped Torres to score his first knockout win as a professional boxer. Wins over Eliseo Benitez and Mateo Valdes followed, and Molinares then challenged for the Colombian national Welterweight title, which was vacant at the time. Molinares fought 3‚Äì6‚Äì1 Simon Ramos on June 21, 1985 in Cartagena, winning the national championship by knockout. Winning the national title was followed by wins over Jairo Segovia, Glenroy Savage and Emilio Olivera, all of whom fell by knockout to Molinares' punches. Then Molinares experienced a raise in opposition quality when he boxed the highly experienced Ezequier \\"Cocoa\\" Sanchez, a boxer who had faced some of the very best fighters in the world, fighting mainly in his native Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico but also in the United States, Venezuela and South Africa. Sanchez had previously boxed Benjamin Ortiz, Norman Goins, Vilomar Fernandez, Samuel Serrano, trial-horse Rocky Orengo, Jose Fernandez, 22‚Äì2‚Äì2 Ben Lekalake, Rocky Ramon, Blackie Zamora, Alexis Arguello, Jerome Artis, Idelfonso Bethelmy, Ralph Racine, Jose Luis Ramirez and Howard Davis Jr. among many others, before trading gloves with Molinares on December 14, 1985 at the Humberto Perea Coliseum in Barranquilla. Against such opposition, Sanchez was able to garner a winning record of 30‚Äì11‚Äì2, but, offsetting his opponent's vast experience advantage, Molinares stopped Sanchez, winning the bout by technical knockout. Saul Julio, who, at 16‚Äì1‚Äì1 was considered another top Colombian prospect at the time, next faced Molinares, Molinares coming on top by knockout on January 31, 1986 in Cartagena. On March 14, 1986, Molinares beat Ruben Veliz and then he faced former WBC Fecarbox regional Welterweight champion, Panamanian Carlos Trujillo, who had recently challenged Milton McCrory for McCrory's WBC world welterweight championship; and who was coming off losing to the heralded South African Harold Volbrecht. On April 30, 1986 at Barranquilla, Molinares outpointed Trujillo. By then, Molinares was ranked among the top ten welterweights around the world by the WBA. =Fecarbox title= A win over mismatched Edgar Rodriguez (1‚Äì3 before their bout) followed the Trujillo victory and then, on November 15, 1986, Molinares faced Mexican Sergio Sanchez, 18‚Äì7‚Äì1, at the Estadio Metropolitano in Barranquilla. This fight was for the Federacion Caribena de Boxeo's (Fecarbox-Caribbean boxing Federation) vacant welterweight championship. Molinares won the Caribbean area's title by defeating Sanchez with a knockout. Undefeated Jorge Manchengo (8‚Äì0) was dispatched next, a technical knockout victim on December 12, 1986. A couple of wins over mismatched Alberto Lindo (3‚Äì3) and Maxiliano Cimarra (1‚Äì0) (fought at San Andres Island, the first time Molinares boxed as a professional boxer outside of mainland Colombia) followed, and then, on June 19, 1987, Molinares boxed 10‚Äì1‚Äì1 Eduardo Bautista in Barranquilla, winning by knockout. A rematch with Simon Ramos, by now 3‚Äì9‚Äì1, followed, fight in which Molinares again stopped Ramos, this time on September 4, 1987. Next was Molinares' international debut as a professional boxer, when he faced 11‚Äì6‚Äì3 Fernando Martinez on October 24, 1987, at the Tamiami Fairgrounds Auditorium in Miami, Florida, United States, as part of an undercard that featured a world championship main event for the WBC world Super Flyweight title between Molinares' countryman Sugar Baby Rojas and former world champion, Argentine Gustavo Ballas. Tomas Molinares won his American debut by knocking Martinez out. Panama's Eduardo Rodriguez had challenged Donald Curry for Curry's undisputed world Welterweight title, beaten Trujillo and lost to Ruben Dario Palacios before he and Molinares had a showdown on Friday, December 18, 1987, as part of an undercard headed by Fidel Bassa's defense of his WBA world Flyweight title against Felix Marti at the Plaza de Toros Cartagena de Indias in Cartagena. Molinares won this test by knocking Rodriguez (20‚Äì8 coming in) out. A win over Emiro Oliveros and one against Eric Perea (10‚Äì5) followed, both by knockout. Molinares next challenged Marlon Starling for the American's WBA world welterweight title. =World champion= With a record of 23‚Äì0, 20 wins by knockout, Molinares flew to the United States to fight WBA world welterweight champion Marlon Starling, who had upset Mark Breland to win the championship. Staged on July 29, 1988 at the Atlantic City Convention Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the bout was scheduled to a limit distance of 12 rounds. The referee was Puerto Rican Joe Cortez. It was a close fight; after five rounds, Starling led on the scorecards of Bernie Soto and Ove Ovesen by a single point, 48‚Äì47 on both judges' cards, while Guy Jutras had the bout a tie at 48‚Äì48. The fighting pair were involved in a rather long blows exchange towards the end of round six, Starling being near the ropes at the time. Then they moved, Starling's back facing one of the ring's corners. The two boxers then launched hard, interchanging, over-looping right hands. Starling's missed but Molinares' hit Starling on the button of Starling's chin. About that moment, the bell sounded to finish the round. Starling fell to the floor face- first, and was counted out by referee Cortez. Starling sprained his right ankle after he fell on top of it. Jim Lampley and Larry Merchant, covering the fight for American television channel HBO, believed that the punch had been launched clearly after the bell. However, video footage shows the punch may have been thrown only a second or so after it rang. Starling himself was unaware that he had been floored and expressed no knowledge of being counted out by referee Cortez during an interview with Merchant immediately after the bout. =Fight controversy= The Molinares-Starling bout formed part of a series of famous fights that had controversial endings around that era (including Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. versus Meldrick Taylor I, Greg Haugen versus Miguel Santana, James Douglas versus Mike Tyson and Haugen versus Hector Camacho Sr. I). Larry Hazzard, the New Jersey State Athletic Commission's chairman at the time, thought that Cortez was right in counting Starling out and giving Molinares the win, declaring that the punch may have landed a fraction of a second after the bell but that Molinares threw it before the bell rang (therefore, at first, Hazzard believed that Molinares had won the bout legally). Upon further review, however, Hazzard changed his mind and declared that the commission would not recognize the bout's original result and it would be therefore changed into a no contest. He, however, deferred the decision whether to continue recognizing Molinares as a world champion or not to the WBA. This was reported on the New York Times sports section on August 12, 1988. The same day that the New York Times published that information, in Panama City, Panama, the WBA announced that despite the New Jersey commission's change of the fight results, they would continue recognizing Molinares as their official world champion until he lost the title in a boxing fight or abdicated his crown as WBA world welterweight champion. This was also announced, on August 13, on the New York Times. =After the Starling fight= Molinares started facing trouble to defend his title right away. He reportedly had problems making his division's weight limit of 147 pounds, but on December 16, the Los Angeles Times announced that Molinares would be defending his WBA world championship against former world champion and 1984 Olympic gold medal winner, Mark Breland on February 4. This bout, however, never took place. Although Molinares, technically at least, had not defeated Starling, he continued undefeated up until that point, with 23 wins, 20 by knockout, and the Starling bout having been declared a no-contest. It was reported from Colombia, however, that the champion was having personal problems, suffering from depression. He vacated the title and took a few months off boxing. When he returned, on April 15, 1989, he was surprisingly knocked out by the 7‚Äì7‚Äì2 Horacio Perez, losing his condition as an undefeated boxer. He fought only once more as a professional boxer, suffering an even bigger upset when faced with the debuting Jose Luis Esteven, who also beat the now former world champion by a knockout. Both his two final bouts took place at Barranquilla. Molinares had a final professional boxing record of 23 wins, 2 losses and one no-contest, with 20 of those wins by knockout. He and Ken Norton stand out as boxers who were world champions despite never having officially won a world title bout. Retirement Molinares, it was reported on such outlets as Guantes boxing magazine, was facing marital problems as well as depression after becoming world champion. It was speculated widely in Colombia that his family had suffered from mental problems for generations. (in Spanish) It was later reported that after retirement, Molinares was seen working at a warehouse owned by his manager, Willy Chams. After these claims, Chams died, and Molinares' whereabouts are currently unknown, although Boxrec.com states his current residence as being in Barranquilla. Personal Molinares was once married and has two children.

Originally trained in France, she was a talented but unpredictable filly with a tendency to swerve left or right in the closing stages of her races. After finishing third in her only race as a two-year-old in 2012, she fell on her three-year-old debut but then proved herself a top-class filly by finishing second to Treve in the Prix de Diane and then winning the Irish Oaks. She was off the course for over a year before returning in 2014 but failed to win in four subsequent races. Background Chicquita is a bay mare with no white markings, bred in Ireland by Ecurie des Monceaux & Skymarc Farm Inc. As a yearling in August 2011 the filly was put up for auction and sold for ‚Ç¨600,000 to Badgers Bloodstock. She entered the ownership of the Australian Paul Makin and was sent into training in France with Alain de Royer-Dupr√©. Makin named the filly after a famous Australian racehorse of the 1950s. She was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Montjeu whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a breeding stallion his other progeny included Motivator, Authorized, Pour Moi, Camelot, Scorpion, Masked Marvel, Hurricane Fly, St Nicholas Abbey and Hurricane Run. Chicquita is the first foal of her dam Prudenzia who showed considerable ability in a brief racing career highlighted by a victory in the Listed Prix de la Seine in May 2008. She was descended from the French broodmare Faizebad (foaled 1962) who has been the ancestor of many major winners including Doyoun and Alexandrova Racing career =2012: two-year-old season= Chicquita made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over 1800 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse and started at odds of 4/1 in an eleven-runner field. Ridden by St√©phane Pasquier she recovered after being hampered soon after the start and finished third behind the Freddy Head-trained Intimhir. =2013: three-year-old season= On 24 May 2013 Chicqita began her second season in the Prix Lunadix, a minor stakes race over 2100 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. After leading soon after the start before accelerating away from her seven rivals (headed by Intimhir). Fhe was three lengths clear and looked certain to win when she veered to the right, collided with the hedge bordering the course, and fell 50 metres from the finish. Despite her fall she was then stepped up sharply in class for the Group 1 Prix de Diane at Chantilly Racecourse on 14 June in which she was ridden as at Saint-Cloud by Antoine Hamelin. She started a 25/1 outsider but exceeded expectations as she came from far back in the field to finish second behind Treve despite hanging left in the straight. The unplaced runners included Silasol (Prix Marcel Boussac, Prix Saint-Alary), Esoterique and Flotilla (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf, Poule d'Essai des Pouliches). Chicquita was then sent to Ireland and moved up in distance for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh Racecourse on 20 July, with the ride going to the experienced local jockey Johnny Murtagh. The Ribblesdale Stakes winner Riposte (trained by the widow of the recently deceased Henry Cecil) started favourite ahead of The Oaks winner Talent with Chicquita the 9/2 third choice in the betting. The Ballydoyle stable of Aidan O'Brien fielded three runners, namely Venus de Milo (Naas Oaks Trial), Just Pretending (third in the Irish 1,000 Guineas) and Magical Dream (C L Weld Park Stakes) whilst the only other runner was the Jim Bolger-trained Scintillula. Just Pretending set a steady pace with Murtagh settling the French-trained filly in third place. Chicquita began to make progress approaching the final furlong and despite veering to the left in the closing stages she gained the advantage in the final strides and won by half a length and a neck from Venus de Milo and Just Pretending. After the race her trainer Alain de Royer-Dupr√© said \\"She never won before this race. I knew she was a top, top filly and we came here because The Curragh is a typical racecourse for this type of filly with a big action. I know she stays. Johnny gave her a good ride because she is not easy you cannot do too much too quickly on her... She could have an exceptional career except for what she does at the end of a race\\". In September 2013 Paul Makin announced that he was selling off nearly all of his horses and Chicquita was offered for sale at Goffs in November. She was bought for ‚Ç¨6,000,000, a record for a horse sold at auction in Ireland, by the bloodstock agents Peter & Ross Doyle, acting on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. She was transferred to the stable of Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. =2014: four-year-old season= Chicquita made her first track appearance for well over a year when she contested the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh on 14 September 2014 and finished second to the three-year-old Tarfasha. In the 2014 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 5 October she started a 40/1 outsider and finished fifteenth of the twenty runners behind Treve. Two weeks later she started at odds of 7/1 for the British Champions Fillies & Mares Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in which she was ridden as on her two previous starts by her trainer's son Joseph. After tracking the leaders she took the lead approaching the final furlong but then \\"threw it away\\" as she veered to the left and was beaten into third by Madame Chiang and Silk Sari. She ended her racing career with a trip to California for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on 1 November in which she faced top-class male opposition. Ridden by Frankie Dettori and facing on a left-handed track for the first time since her three- year-old debut, she finished fifth of the twelve runners behind Main Sequence, Flintshire, Twilight Eclipse and Telescope.

The Centre was funded in the 2017 ARC funding round. Aims FLEET aims to develop a new generation of ultra-low resistance electronic devices, capitalising on Australian research in atomically thin materials, topological materials, exciton superfluids and nanofabrication. Programmes FLEET is pursuing three broad research themes to develop devices in which electrical current can flow without resistance:http://www.fleet.org.au/innovate/ * Topological insulators: a relatively new class of materials and recognised by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics, topological insulators conduct electricity only along their edges, and strictly in one direction. This one-way path conducts electricity without loss of energy due to resistance. Approaches being used within FLEET to study topological materials include magnetic topological insulators and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), topological Dirac semimetals (including oxide ‚Äòantiperovskites‚Äô) and artificial topological systems (artificial graphene and 2D topological insulators). * Exciton superfluids: a quantum state known to achieve electrical current flow with minimal wasted dissipation of energy. FLEET aims to develop superfluid devices that operate at room temperature, without the need for expensive, energy-intensive cooling. Approaches being used within FLEET‚Äôs include exciton‚Äìpolariton bosonic condensation in atomically thin materials, topologically-protected exciton‚Äìpolariton flow, and exciton superfluids in twin-layer materials. * Light-transformed materials: a material can be temporarily forced into a new state by applying an intense light beam. FLEET aims to study the fundamental physics behind this temporary state change. Approaches being pursued in FLEET include optically-induced Floquet topological states (topological states that change with time), nonequilibrium superfluidity and creation of topological states in multi-dimensional extensions of the kicked quantum rotor. These approaches are enabled by the following two technologies: *Atomically thin materials: FLEET seeks to find new ways of controlling the properties of two-dimensional materials via synthesis, substrates, and tuning electric and magnetic ordering. * Nanodevice fabrication: FLEET aims to work on new techniques to integrate novel atomically thin materials into high-quality device structures with suitable performance. Participants FLEET is an Australian initiative, headquartered at Monash University, and in conjunction with the Australian National University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Queensland, RMIT University, the University of Wollongong and Swinburne University of Technology, complemented by a group of Australian and international partners. It is funded by the Australian Research Council and by the member universities. FLEET's Director is Michael Fuhrer, who is an ARC Laureate Fellow in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Monash University studying two-dimensional materials (of which graphene is the most well known example), and topological insulators.http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/michael- fuhrer(094ed4a1-ce83-4b84-a38b-a95ab12f547d).html Deputy Director is Alexander Hamilton at the University of New South Wales. FLEET partners include Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Synchrotron, California Institute of Technology, Columbia University in the City of New York, Johannes Gutenberg University at Mainz, University of Maryland Joint Quantum Institute & National Institute of Standards and Technology, Max Plank Institute of Quantum Optics, the National University of Singapore, the University of Colorado Boulder, University of Maryland Center for Nanophysics and Advanced Materials, the University of Texas at Austin, Tsinghua University at Beijing, and the University of W√ºrzburg in Germany.

It is the largest festival of its kind, in Greece , reaching more than 40.000 visitors in a 4-day long program involving musical performances and street events. All forms and modes of urban music and culture have a place in the line-up of Street Mode Festival, a program that involves live gigs in 5 stages and more than 15 shows and contests of street art, street dance, parkour and action sports.  History  The first Street Mode Festival was organized in September 2009 in the Central Square of Thermi, a suburb in Thessaloniki, Greece. The event was conceptualized, organized and produced by Giannis Efstathiou (aka Nox1), and during its first year it offered a graffiti jam, a skate contest, and a live musical performance by ‚ÄúVodka Juniors‚Äù. During the next years, a big amount of bands was added to the program, along with new events such as street dance battles and parkour jams. The Central square of Thermi remained the venue of the festival for 5 years, from 2009 to 2013, where artists from all over Greece were invited to perform in front of the constantly growing audience. In 2014, the festival moved to a bigger venue, Pier A & Warehouse C at the port area of Thessaloniki. The addition of the reggae icon ‚ÄúAlpha Blondie‚Äù and the legendary hip-hop band ‚ÄúSugar Hill Gang‚Äù to Street Mode 2016 signaled the first international entries to the festival‚Äôs musical line-up. Numerous internationally acclaimed acts additions followed the next years such as Ska-P, New Model Army, Turbonegro, Phil Campbell, Max Romeo, Pussy Riot, Looptroop Rockers and Dubioza Kolektiv. The year 2017 was a turning point in the history of the festival, as it moved to a bigger venue (FIX Open-Air Multiplex in Thessaloniki) giving space to more than 80 bands from all over the world to perform in 5 stages during a 3-day long program. The significant increase in not only the amount but also the variety in musical acts and other events since 2016, contributed to shape a new character to the festival and from that point and on, Street Mode established a reputation as a major-type festival. In 2019, it returned to the port area of Thessaloniki, but this time at Pier B & Warehouse 8.  Artists  The following artists have appeared in Street Mode Festival.

Geography  Fylingthorpe is located about inland from the coast of the North Sea, and about from Robin Hood's Bay, the larger of the two settlements within Fylingdales Parish, between and above sea level. The country rises sharply west of the village itself towards Fyling Hall school by about 100 m in 1 km. The underlying geology is boulder clay.  History  Fylingthorpe, then an agglomeration-type settlement, is reported in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"waste\\" and non-populated. It came under the jurisdiction of William de Percy who between 1091 and 1096 granted it to Whitby Abbey. The village was originally only known as Thorpe and in the 13th century as Prestethorpe. The Fawside family, who originated in Scotland and accompanied King James I, had Thorpe Hall mansion built in 1680. They later changed their name into Farsyde and, as lords of Fylingdales Manor, were involved in various conflicts of political, religious, and military nature. They were also involved in shipping and smuggling. railway station on the now defunct Scarborough and Whitby Railway served the nearby school from 1885 to 1965, but the village was nearer to the station at . In 1923, the boarding school of Fyling Hall was founded in a Georgian country house near the village. It is still in operation.  Notable buildings  Fyling Hall School The Pigsty Thorpe Hall, an Elizabethan mansion built by the Fawside family in 1680 and extended twice in the 19th century, now serves as bed and breakfast accommodation. The Georgian country house of Fyling Hall, built in 1810 and now the home of Fyling Hall School, replaced an earlier hall where in 1632 the politician Sir Hugh Cholmeley was born. St Stephen's Old Church north of the village, a chapel of ease which contains memorials for shipwrecked sailors, was built in 1821 as a preaching church, replacing a predecessor. It is a Grade I listed building. The \\"Pigsty\\" is an architectural folly south of Fyling Hall, built in the late 19th century as pig stables in a neoclassical style by John Barry, a shipowner and resident of the mansion, and is now rented out as holiday accommodation by the Landmark Trust.

It is now kept in the Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges. It is unsigned, but has invariably been attributed to Hans Memling since the middle of the 19th century. Description The painting is an early example of an Early Netherlandish devotional diptych, which still preserves the original frame and hinges. A new invention was showing the scene in a continuous room, instead of against a monochrome background. The window at the upper left originally was clear glass, showing a landscape. The composition was changed at a later stage to show the coat of arms of Van Nieuwenhove here instead. It was more common to have this on the outer panels than this prominently. It is surrounded by four images of a hand sowing seeds, a pun on the name of the donor which means \\"from the new garden\\". The same coat of arms can also be seen on the clasp of the book in front of Van Nieuwenhove. The mirror behind Mary shows the scene in reverse, making it even more explicit that the two panels are placed in the same room and time, even though the actual configuration seen in the mirror does not match the scene in the main painting. Memling only included the mirror in a later stage of the composition. This unity of space was also emphasized by small details like the carpet to the left of Mary, which reappears beneath the hands of van Nieuwenhove. The work was probably intended to be displayed with the two panels at an angle, but it is uncertain how exactly they should be placed. One possibility is that it was intended to be hung from a wall or column, with the Virign panel fixed and the van Nieuwenhove panel loose. The inscription at the bottom of the two panels reads \\"HOC OPUS FIERI FECIT MARTINUS DE NEWENHOVEN ANNO DM 1487 - ANO VERO ETATIS SUE 23\\" meaning \\"Maarten van Nieuwenhove had this work made in 1487\\" (left panel) and \\"At the age of 23\\" (right panel). The glass panels in the windows depict Saint Christopher and Saint George (above the Virgin and Child) and Saint Martin of Tours (as his namesake saint) above Maarten van Nieuwenhove. Through the open window, one can see the Minnewater, also (mistakenly) known as the \\"Lake of Love\\" ('minne' being the Medieval term for 'love' in Dutch), a romantic corner of Bruges. The donor Maarten van Nieuwenhove (11 November 1463 - 16 August 1500) came from a noble family of Bruges with connections at the court of Burgundy. In the 1490s, Van Nieuwenhove was successively a city councilor, the captain of the civic guard, and in 1498 mayor of Bruges. Provenance *Ordered by Marten van Nieuwenhove in 1487. *Bruges, Saint Julian Hospital. *Owned by the Old St. John's Hospital since 1815. This was turned into a museum in 1839.

It operates a fleet of Sikorsky S-92 flying services to offshore oil platforms for oil companies. The company was incorporated in 2009 and commenced operations in 2012. Babcock International owns a majority of the company. History Norsk Helikopterservice was the brainchild of Bj√∏rn Veum Seljevold. At the age of 54, he was working as a heavy helicopter inspector for the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority. His background was helicopter pilot and having started a helicopter operating company in the United States. He saw that the offshore market was split between Helikopter Service and Norsk Helikopter (later Bristow Norway). He therefore started working on plans to found his own offshore helicopter company. His aim was to capture about twenty to twenty-five percent of the market, which he estimated would total about fifty aircraft. NHS Sikorsky S-92A at Sumburgh Airport The company was incorporated in 2009. It \\"borrowed\\" its name from that of its two main competitors, after the company discovered that they had not properly protected their trademarks. The company decided to establish its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola, due to it being a national center for helicopter traffic and ease of access to other oil cities. Norsk Helikopterservice bought the hangar formerly built to house Braathens Helikopter. It took several years to get the company in shape to commence operations. The first major hurdle was financing. This resulted with an agreement with Bond Offshore Helicopters based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and World Helicopters Norway, where the latter received sixty-fiver percent of the shares. This company was part of the Avincis group. The remaining thirty percent were held by Norwegian investors, including many of the key employees.Olsen-Hagen: 95 Operations commenced on 14 June 2012, with an AgustaWestland AW139 leased from Bond and operated with ad hoc flights on the British sector. A joint order between Bond and NHS was made for sixteen Sikorsky S-92A helicopters, eight to each company. The first two were delivered to NHS in February 2013, and the original order was scheduled to run until 2017. The aircraft were contracted to Bond, who at the time had their fleet of Eurocopter EC225 Super Pumas grounded. The two S-92s were based at Aberdeen Airport and crewed by NHS employees.Olsen-Hagen: 97 References Bibliography * Airlines of Norway Helicopter airlines Airlines established in 2009 2009 establishments in Norway Companies based in Sola ","title":"Norsk Helikopterservice"},{"id":"54291286","text":"Stanley K.

The weather also caused power cuts and telecommunications disruptions, making it difficult for rescuers to reach affected communities. Reaz Ahmed, head of Bangladesh's Disaster Management Department, said the landslides were the worst in the country's history.  Cause of the disaster  The landslide was caused by an incessant downpour that began early morning of 12 June, dropping 34.3 centimetres (13.5 inches) of rain in 24 hours. The monsoon and depression over Bay of Bengal towards Bangladesh resulted in heavy rain over different parts, including Dhaka and Chittagong. A study, performed after the events, indicated that the large portion of the area was already highly susceptible to landslide due to the existing factors such as steep slope, deforestation, hill cutting etc. and the intense rainfall acted as a triggering factor. The seasonal monsoon often causes floods and mudslides in the southern hills of Bangladesh. Deforestation in the area also contributed to the devastation, as well as rapid urbanisation. Indigenous leader Bijoy Giri Chakma told Channel NewsAsia that tree felling had completely denuded some hill slides, adding that he had never seen worse landslides. A second factor was lack of land forcing poor people to live in marginal areas where rents are low. Bandarban government administrator Dilip Kumar Banik told the Associated Press that many people had built homes on slopes despite official warnings. In Cox's Bazar, officials said that 300,000 people in the area live on landslide-prone hills. The district administrators have ordered officials to create a list of homes at risk, and are discussing plans to relocate them, executive magistrate Saiful Islam told Bdnews24.com.  Extent of the disaster  As of 15 June 2017, officials were reporting a death toll as high as 152 in both Bangladesh and neighbouring India, with hundreds injured and many missing. Officials expected the toll to rise. Shah Kamal, secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management, said it could take days to reach affected areas. \\"The devastation is huge\\", he told the Associated Press. In some areas, there was as much as 1.2 metres (four feet) of mud. The worst-hit district was Rangamati, where landslides buried hillside houses where people were sleeping. At least 20 separate landslides hit the district. Up to 105 deaths were reported as of 15 June, and 5,000 homes were damaged. Roads in Rangamati remained inaccessible on 15 June. Many roads in the district were washed away, leaving craters up to 15 metres (50 feet) deep, or heaped with debris. The district's power grid was also destroyed. There were also fuel and food shortages as of 15 June, and Belayet Hossain Mia Belal, president of the district chamber of commerce and industry, told the Daily Star that the food shortage could become dire in two to four days. Twenty-nine people were reported dead in Chittagong and six in Bandarban. Roads in Bandarban were cleared by 15 June, when 2,000 people were able to return to their villages to see the devastation. Two people were killed in Cox's Bazar, the town hosting thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees. Houses in Khagrachari district were flooded nearly to the rooftops. Two officers and two soldiers of the Bangladesh Army (Major Mohammad Mahfuzul Haq, Captain Md Tanvir Salam Shanto, Corporal Mohammad Azizul Haq and soldier Md Shahin Alam) were killed after a second landslide struck a highway-clearing operation in Rangamati. The body of a fifth army personnel, soldier Md Azizur Rahman, was found 15 June. At least 11 people were killed in flooding in the Indian states of Mizoram and Assam, caused by the same storms.  Response  The Bangladesh government attempted to warn people ahead of the storm, using loudspeakers, but were not able to reach all areas. More than 10,000 people did get evacuated to emergency shelters. In the two days immediately after the landslides, rescue workers were having trouble reaching victims as roads were choked with mud and rain continued. Heavy digging equipment could not reach remote areas. As of 14 June, power and cell service were still off in the affected areas. Doctors worked by candlelight to help the injured. Thousands of Bangladesh army soldiers were already stationed in the area because of a long-standing insurgency; and they were directed to help in the rescue effort. The Bangladesh navy also helped reach people cut off by flooding. Reaz Ahmed, head of Bangladesh's Disaster Management Department, said the landslides were the worst in the country's history. Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made statements of shock and sympathy, praying for the affected and urging swift rescue action. Radical Bangladesh pressure group Hefazat also issued a press release urging members to help victims and offering prayers and sympathy. The government of Bangladesh also offered cash and building materials to affected families. Local authorities offered temporary food and shelter. Abroad, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted condolences, prayers, and an offer of help with the rescue effort. The governments of Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, the United States, Iran, Nepal, and Russia also sent condolences.

A native of Beijing's Daxing District, Weng came to the attention of the Qianlong Emperor who was impressed with Weng's translation of the Peach Blossom Spring (Ê°ÉËä±Ê∫ê Tao Hua Yuan) by Tao Yuanming into the Manchu language. He was employed at court as a junior compiler, and later rose to become a member of the Grand Secretariat. Despite holding government posts in Shandong, Jiangxi and Jiangsu, Weng spend most of his professional life in Beijing, so as to be close to the literati of his day. Weng proposed the imposition of classical rules on poetry, in an attempt to curb what he saw as the weaker, more abstract works of his contemporaries, particularly those who followed the style of Wang Yangming. He was opposed to Wang Yangming's philosophy that man had an innate goodness, as he felt this detracted from the achievements of historical saints and Confucian worthies. Despite his preference for formal structure, Weng admired the works of Li Bai and wrote passionate defences of Li Bai's work. He also favoured Su Shi's work, and named a room in his personal library after one of Su's poetry collections that Weng obtained in 1773. His views on poetry led him to create the Jili pai or \\"School of Musculature\\", a system of poetic criticism that focused on scholarly contemplation of universal patterns and structures. Weng was also noted for his calligraphy, which was modelled after that of Ouyang Xun and Yu Shinan. He specialised in lishu script, and was regarded as having the same degree of skill as Liu Yong.

Established in 1974, the company lasted until 1980 when it merged with its main competitor, Helikopter Service. Offshore Helicopters flew mostly to Statfjord, and had at its peak eight helicopters. It flew a scheduled service from Bod√∏ to V√¶r√∏y between 1976 and 1979. History Through the late 1960s and early 1970s there was a boom in offshore oil exploration and later production. This led to a steady increase in offshore helicopter traffic, although initially only Helikopter Service was able to capture it. Three significant airlines therefore went together to form a challenger. Offhsore Helicopters was incorporated by Fred. Olsen Airtransport, Helitourist and M√∏refly on 31 October 1974. Its head office was located at Bergen Airport, Flesland, with a second base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. The airline received an offshore operating concession the same year.Olsen-Hagen: 85 The airline initially bought two fifteen- passenger A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma. There was a desire both among politicians and oil companies that there be created a challenger to Helikopter Service, but it proved difficult for Offshore Helicopters to secure significant contracts. Their main operations was a joint contract with Helikopter Service to fly to Statfjord. This involved an extensive cooperation with the larger company, forcing Offshore Helicopters to sell their Pumas and instead buy two Sikorsky S-61N and two Bell 212 in order to unify the fleets. All maintenance of the Sikorskys were done by Helikopter Service, although Offshore Helicopters maintained their Bells. By 1978 the fleet had increased to four aircraft of each class.Olsen-Hagen: 86 The airline operated a scheduled passenger service between 1976 and 1979, between Bod√∏ Airport and the island of V√¶r√∏y. The route was subsidized by the government and awarded to Wider√∏e, who also operated the rest of the subsidized regional network. Wider√∏e bought a Sikorsky S-58T, but subcontracted the operations to Offshore Helicopter. The company took over an old hangar at Bod√∏ and had four people stationed there. M√∏refly and Helitourist eventually sold their shares to Fred. Olsen. In 1980 they have up operating the airline, and agreed to a merger with Helikopter Service. Fred. Olsen was paid in shares in the merged Helikopter Service, receiving an ownership share of fifteen percent.

Gold Estate, also known as the Marigold Lodge, is a summer estate located at 1116 Hazel Avenue in Holland, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The estate is owned by furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, which uses it as a training center and private hotel for its customers. History Egbert H. Gold was born in 1868 in Cornwall, Connecticut. His family had been designers and manufacturers of steam heating systems; Gold's father invented the first cast-iron radiator. Gold went into the family business, but in 1901 struck out on his own and established a company based in Chicago. In 1913, while yachting with his wife Margaret, Gold anchored in Lake Macatawa and went ashore to explore this peninsula. Seeing potential in the land, he purchased the property in December of that year. He had the land built up, and in 1913 began construction of a lodge on the property. Gold hired architect Thomas Eddy Tallmadge to design the lodge, and H. D. Deam to build it. He named the property \\"Marigold\\" after his wife Margaret and daughter Mary Jayne. (note: large pdf file) Gold was an avid horticulturist, and imported plantings to landscape the grounds and built greenhouses on the property. During the 1920s, Gold expanded and remodeled the lodge, and he continued to visit until his death in 1928. Margaret Gold later met and married opera singer Mischa Thorgevsky, and the family continued to use the estate until her death in 1968. In 1969, Mary Jane Gold, Egbert and Margaret's only surviving child, donated the lodge and grounds to Hope College. However, the high cost of maintenance caused the college to eventually sell the estate to manufacturer Herman Miller in 1978. Herman Miller refurbished and updated the buildings and furnishings, and uses the estate as a training center and private hotel for its customers. Description Marigold Lodge is located on a 7-1/2 acre peninsula which projects into Lake Macatawa. The main house is a two-story Prairie School structure with dark wood and stucco facades. The property also includes a guest house, as gazebo, and other modern structures. The main house has been converted into a visitor's center and hotel by Herman Miller. Other earlier structures have been replaced or reconstructed by Herman Miller. The main lodge has a low pitched hipped roof covered with brown shingles, penetrated by red brick chimneys and pointed dormers. The facades are faced with stucco, and have horizontal bands of dark wood. The south facade has a one-story enclosed sun porch, now used as a dining room. The east and west facades have smaller enclosed porches. A service and guest wing is attached to the north facade. Inside the lodge, the first story contains a living room, two dining rooms, a library, and sun porch. The service wing contains a modern kitchen, and office, and an employee lounge. The second story has eight bedrooms, each with attached bathrooms.

Regulatory context Under the eIDAS-regulation, an associated signature container (ASiC) for eIDAS is a data container that is used to hold a group of file objects and digital signatures and/or time assertions that are associated to those objects. This data is stored in the ASiC in a ZIP format. European Commission Implementing Decision 2015/1506 of 8 September 2015 laid down specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27 and 37 of the eIDAS-regulation. EU Member States requiring an advanced electronic signature or an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate, shall recognise XML, CMS or PDF advanced electronic signature at conformance level B, T or LT level or using an associated signature container, where those signatures comply with the following technical specifications: * XAdES Baseline Profile - ETSI TS 103171 v.2.1.1. * CAdES Baseline Profile - ETSI TS 103173 v.2.2.1. * PAdES Baseline Profile - ETSI TS 103172 v.2.2.2. * Associated Signature Container Baseline Profile - ETSI TS 103174 v.2.2.1 Material has been copied from this source. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged. Technical specification of ASiCs have been updated and standardized since April 2016 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute in the standard Associated Signature Containers (ASiC)(ETSI EN 319 162-1 V1.1.1 (2016-04), but this updated standard is not required by the European Commission Implementing Decision. Structure The internal structure of an ASiC includes two folders: * A root folder that stores all the container‚Äôs content, which might include folders that reflect the structure of that content. * A ‚ÄúMETA-INF‚Äù folder that resides in the root folder and contains files that hold metadata about the content, including its associated signature and/or time assertion files. Such an electronic signature file would contain a single CAdES object or one or more XAdES signatures. A time assertion file would either contain a one timestamp token that will conform to IETF RFC 3161, whereas a single evidence record would conform to IETF RFC 4998 or IETF RFC6283. How ASiC is used One of the purposes of an electronic signature is to secure the data that it is attached to it from being modified. This can be done by creating a dataset that combines the signature with its signed data or to store the detached signature to a separate resource and then utilize an external process to re-associate the signature with its data. It can be advantageous to use detached signatures because it prevents unauthorized modifications to the original data objects. However, by doing this, there is the risk that the detached signature will become separated from its associated data. If this were to happen, the association would be lost and therefore, the data would become inaccessible. One of the most widespread deployments of the ASiC standard is the Estonian digital signature system with the use of multiplatform (Windows, Linux, MacOS (OSX)) software called DigiDoc. Types of ASiC containers Using the correct tool for each job is always important. Using the correct type of ASiC container for the job at hand is also important: =ASiC Simple (ASiC-S)= With this container, a single file object is associated with a signature or time assertion file. A ‚Äúmimetype‚Äù file that specifies the media type might also be included in this container. When a mimetype file is included, it is required to be the first file in the ASiC container. This container type will allow additional signatures to be added in the future to be used to sign stored file objects. When long-term time-stamp tokens are used, ASiC Archive Manifest files are used to protect long-term time-stamp tokens from tampering. =ASiC Extended (ASiC-E)= This type of container can hold one or more signature or time assertion files. ASiC-E with XAdES deals with signature files, while ASiC-E with CAdES deals with time assertions. The files within these ASiC containers apply to their own file object sets. Each file object might have additional metadata or information that is associated with it that can also be protected by the signature. An ASiC-E container could be designed to prevent this modification or allow its inclusion without causing damage to previous signatures. Both of these ASiC containers are capable of maintaining long-term availability and integrity when storing XAdES or CAdES signatures through the use of time-stamp tokens or evidence record manifest files that are contained within the containers. ASiC containers must comply with the ZIP specification and limitations that are applied to ZIP. =ASiC-S time assertion additional container= This container operates under the baseline requirements of the ASiC Simple (ASiC-S) container but it also provides additional time assertion requirements. Additional elements may be within its META-INF folder and requires the use of ‚ÄúSignedData‚Äù variable to include certificate and revocation information. =ASiC-E CAdES additional container= This container has the same baselines as an ASiC-E container, but with additional restrictions. =ASiC-E time assertion additional container= This container complies with ASiC-E baseline requirements along with additional requirements and restrictions. Reduced risk of loss of electronic signature The use of ASiC reduces the risk of an electronic signature becoming separated from its data by combining the signature and its signed data in a container. With both elements secured within an ASiC, it is easier to distribute a signature and guarantee that the correct signature and its metadata is being used during validation. This process can also be used when associating time assertions, including evidence records or time-stamp tokens to their associated data.

The Upper Valdarno Basin has provided the remains of three fossil canid species dated to the Late Villafranchian era of Europe 1.9-1.8 million years ago that arrived with a faunal turnover around that time. The Swiss paleontologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major discovered two species in this region, these being the Falconer's wolf (Canis falconeri Forsyth Major 1877) that was later reclassified as Lycaon falconeri, and the smaller Etruscan wolf (C. etruscus Forsyth Major 1877). Forsyth Major did not publish a complete description of the Etruscan wolf, and later Domenico Del Campana worked on expanding Forsyth Major's descriptions when he recognized among the specimens a smaller, jackal-sized species. This he named the Arno River dog (C. arnensis Del Campana 1913) in honour of the nearby Arno river. =Type Specimen= Artist's rendition The lectotype is a cranium from an unrecorded locality of Upper Valdarno. It is housed in the Montevarchi Paleontological Museum. The specimen has been designed as lectotype by the Italian paleontologist Danilo Torre in 1967 from the sample described by Forsyth Major. =Canis apolloniensis= One specimen of C. apolloniensis (Koufos and Kostopoulos 1997) was found in site of Apollonia-1 near the village of Nea Apollonia, Macedonia, in northern Greece. The holotype consists of the rostral portion of a skull and a mandible. In 2011, a study compared all of the fifty-five Early Pleistocene wolf-like specimens found across Europe and suggested that their morphometric variation was no different to that of modern wolf populations with their difference in size representing male and female specimens. However, the study proposed two lineages. One lineage is C. arnensis which includes C. accitanus and C. senezensis, and the other lineage being C. etruscus that includes C. apolloniensis. Other studies contrast with this biometric interpretation. Considering morphological features retained by C. apolloniensis, this species should be considered as a synonym of C. mosbachensis or a very affine taxon. =Lineage= The large wolf-sized Canis first appeared in the Middle Pliocene about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, Shanxi Province, China. By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in Yangyuan County, Hebei, China and Kuruksay, Tajikistan. In Europe, C. etruscus first appeared 1.9-1.8 million years ago. The lineage from C. etruscus to the Mosbach wolf (C. mosbachensis Soergel, 1925) to the gray wolf (C. lupus) is widely accepted in the European scientific literature. Nevertheless a recent publication has challenged this well-established hypothesis showing that the peculiarity of the C. etruscus (as shown by Cherin et al., 2014) do not fit with those of more modern Early Pleistocene canids like C. borjgali from Dmanisi, probably the ancestor wolf- like crown-clade species (C. lupus, C. latrans, C. lupaster). The French archaeologist Jean-Philip Brugal proposes C. mosbachensis as a subspecies of C. etruscus, and another French archaeologist Henry de Lumley considers C. mosbachensis to be a subspecies of the gray wolf and proposes a classification of C. lupus mosbachensis. Paleoecology The dispersal of carnivoran species occurred approximately 1.8 million years ago and this coincided with a decrease in precipitation and an increase of annual seasonality which followed the 41,000 year amplitude shift of Milankovitch cycles. First to arrive was C. etruscus, which was immediately followed by C. arnensis and Lycaon falconeri, and then the giant hyena Pachycrocuta brevirostris. These were all better adapted to open, dry landscapes than the two more primitive canini Eucyon and Nyctereutes that they replaced in Europe. Description Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled A description of the Etruscan wolf appears below: > Medium-sized dog (average size of a small C. lupus); elongated snout; marked > constriction of the snout beyond the infraorbital foramina; elongated nasal > bones extending beyond the maxillofrontal suture; well-developed sagittal > and nuchal crests; laterally enlarged occipital region; P1-P2-P3 laterally > compressed; P1 with lingual cingulum; P3 normally with both posterior and > accessory cusp (=modified posterior cingulum); large relative length of the > upper molar row (in comparison with C. arnensis); M1 with paracone more > elevated than metacone; labial basin of M1 as deep as but larger than the > lingual one; M1 and M2 with a continuous cingulum; reduced contact area > between M1 and M2. Lower dentition characterized by larger dimensions in > respect to C. arnensis and by a wolf-like M1/M2 ratio. The lower carnassial > (M1) is distinguished by main trigonid cusps (protoconid and paraconid) > relatively small (in comparison with C. lupus) and by talonid cusps > (hypoconid and entoconid) linked by a sinuous cristid. Describing C. etruscus as wolf-like and C. arnensis as jackal-like is therefore an over-simplification, because C. arnensis is more similar to C. lupus than is C. etruscus in some cranial characters. C. etruscus shows a set of peculiar features. Range In the Early Pleistocene from Spain to China.\\\\\\\\\\\\ Extinction The Etruscan wolf and the Arno River dog both disappeared from the fossil record in Italy after the end of the Tasso Faunal Unit and were replaced by the mid-Pleistocene era Mosbach wolf (C. mosbachensis Soergel, 1925) by 1.5 million years ago.

It is located in the municipality of Alzira, Valencia, Spain. Excavation campaigns began in 1978, under the direction of Bernat Mart√≠ Oliver, and continued until 1996, and work on the site was resumed in 2004. From the 1990s Rosa Enguix Alemany and Mar√≠a Jes√∫s de Pedro joined the direction of the site. At present the excavated area covers and includes different structures, like a central street and rectangular departments on both sides; a wall of two meters wide that preserves almost three meters of height (); occupancy soils and abandonment episodes; livestock stabling; and terracing of the slopes to expand its surface. At present the site is property of the Alzira City council, and the new beginning of the excavations by the Servei d'Investigaci√≥ Prehist√≤rica has as objective the consolidation of the exhumed structures and its signposting for visitor access. A nearby burial cave indicates the continuity in the use of natural caves as necropolis, and an individual burial has been found in a pit in the interior of the area too. On the other hand, the recovered remains show a wide chronological sequence between the Early Bronze and the Late Bronze. Location of the Muntanya Assolada  Location  On the right bank of the X√∫quer river is located the Muntanya Assolada Bronze Age village of Alzira. The settlement was built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, west of Tallat Roig, between the Murta and the Aixaveg√≥ ravine, dominating the plain of the river from a height of 227 metres above sea level. The toponym \\"Muntanya Desolada\\" refers to the partial collapse of the summit that occurred in autumn of 1783, the night of 24‚Äì25 October. Until then the place was known as Muntanya de la Font del Baladre. Wall area  Archaeological interventions  The excavations carried out by the Servei d'Investigaci√≥ Prehist√≤rica began in 1978 and continued until 1996, resuming again from 2004. The area currently excavated covers more than and corresponds to different room structures with anthropic deposits and evidences of the different activities developed there, such as occupation soils and abandonment episodes in which fire was detected, perhaps due to the combustion of materials accumulated by livestock stabling, and terracing of the slopes to gradually expand the surface of the village. In its upper part, can be seen a central street and departments on both sides. In one of them it has been documented a domestic oven for cooking bread or toasting cereals. And in the other, the entrance has stone steps. The site is surrounded by a wall that is almost two meters wide and stands three meters high (). It was built on a summit that has been terraced by solid stone and clay buildings arranged in slope, thus prolonging the settlement on the slope. The existence of different levels of occupation, documented by stratigraphy and remains, is corroborated by the remodeling of the structures, some of them quickly and intentionally filled to give way to new construction lines. However, it seems to indicate that it was inhabited continuously throughout the Bronze Age. Ceramic pottery Metallic tips  Archaeological remains  The remains are deposited in the Museu de Prehist√≤ria de Val√®ncia. The pottery shows a variety of shapes, such as cups and bowls, pots and storage urns, fairing and geminated vessels, or spoons; and decorative motifs such as incisions, dots, typed strings, or burnished decoration. Among the metallic objects are gravers, arrowheads, a dagger of rivets, and a chisel, as well as other elements linked to the metallurgical activity, such as slags, a stone hammer and a ceramic crucible. The lithic industry has a good representation of sickle and flint arrowheads, polished stone tool and numerous remains of the lithic reductions. The bone industry is represented by gravers, spatulas and chisels, and by a ring and different ivory buttons. The fauna remains show the results of an agricultural village with sheep and goats predominating, the ox being used as an animal of draft and strength, and as a producer of meat and milk. Also the pig was raised, and there are remains of horse and dog. The hunt of the deer, beyond the necessary protection of the crops against herbivores, indicates the existence of a remarkable vegetation cover. The dating of a set of fauna from the lower layer of a space existing between the upper wall and a thickened structure, that is attached to it, has provided a date of 3470 ¬± 70 BP, between 1890 BC and 1690 BC. Human burial  Human burials  The presence of human burials in the site is attested by the excavation of a small sepulchral cave immediately near the village, in the escarpment of its south-east side, which provided remains of a minimum of four individuals, animal bones and part of the grave goods that are with the buried. On the other side, in its westernmost southern slope, in the space delimited by a wide wall and by different stone courses that follow along the outer slope, a circular grave was excavated that contained another human burial, under a sedimentation of more than of depth. The buried was in fetal position, right lateral decubitus, with the legs folded and the feet crossed. The right arm was elongated behind the back and the hand crushed by a block. The left arm was flexed in front of the body and the hand stretched below the face, missing most of the skull and upper maxilla. The absolute dating of this individual by C-14 has provided a date of 3760 ¬± 40 BP, between 2210 BC and 2130 BC.  Relevance in its context  The Muntanya Assolada has been considered as a typical village of the Valencian Bronze Age, according to some decorative motifs of the pottery, globular and tall carena, the archaism of the lithic industry, the copper metallurgy, or the sepulchral cave found next to the village. The end of its habitation is related to the Late Bronze, attending to the fairing vessels with flared profile and with a pronounced angle of inflection, the flat bases or the presence of authentic bronze in the metallic objects. In fact, the typology of the vessels of Muntanya Assolada corresponds to what is usual in the villages of the Valencian Bronze Age. However, in their highest levels, such shapes as the mentioned fairing vessels are accompanied by the geminados, bowls and outgoing edge pots, considered more-evolved. The two absolute dates are shown in accordance with a sequence from the Early to the Late Bronze Age. La Muntanya Assolada and other nearby sites represent the continuity of a settlement that spans from the Bronze Age to the Iberian Culture, in a permanently occupied territory such as the Ribera del X√∫quer. The site was abandoned in the final period of the Middle Bronze Age or Late Bronze, to give way to a settlement located on the plain, first on Cases de Montcada, during the Late Bronze Age on Escoles Pies and during the Iron Age on the L'Alteret de la Vintihuitena of Albalat, to occupy later the slope of the highest hills with the arrival of the Iberian Culture.

Early life Teresa Moraes was born in Poona, India, in 1930, in a notable Goan family. Her brother was the journalist Frank Moraes. She obtained a BA Honours degree in English and French from St Xavier's College, Bombay, which she followed up with an MA and Ph.D. in history from the University of Bombay. She married Matthew Albuquerque. Career Albuquerque started as a teacher of English and History at high school. Following a stint on a panel that reviewed history books, she took up post-graduate studies in history. She then joined the Heras Institute of Indian History and Culture as a researcher. On the encouragement of John Correia-Afonso, a director of the Institute, she began to investigate the history of Goa. From this research came several books and articles, in particular Anjuna: Profile of a Village in Goa, which was her husband's native village, as well as Goa: The Rachol Legacy, on the four hundred years of a Jesuit seminary in Goa. Her interest in colonial art and architecture resulted in the publication of Under the Archangel's Wings: 400 years of St.Michael‚Äôs Church, Anjuna With a scholarship from the Heras Institute, she studied the Goan diaspora, publishing a book Goans in Kenya. Until the 1960s, east Africa had been a major centre of Goan migration. This book became an important source book for succeeding researchers. Albuquerque published several works on the colonial history of India, especially on the intersection of Portuguese and British rules. Following the 1878 treaty between Britain and Portugal, the Goan economy became subject to British control. Commodities flowed into British India while the Portuguese raised taxes in Goa to compensate for the loss of revenue. A newly built railway line connecting Goa to British India then became a conduit for impoverished economic migrants heading to Bombay.* Albuquerque's book on Goan emigres to British India, Goan Pioneers in Bombay (2011) covered their story; a paper The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1878: Its impact on the people of Goa (1990) discussed the broader impact of the treaty on Goan lives. A popular career taken up by Goans was of music-making, either joining street bands or orchestras in Bombay. Albuquerque reported that there was so much demand for Goan musicians that one entrepreneur named Francisco Menezes sought unemployed men to march in processions, inflating their cheeks without blowing a note. Another career was of bakery, with many such establishments appearing in Bandra, a neighbourhood of Mumbai. According to Albuquerque, this was an early settlement for Goan migrants, from the 1920s. Their skill of making bread translated into a nickname the Goans were given by the other residents of the city - Pao, from the Portuguese word p√£o for bread. Another of her works was on the contributions of Christians to the Indian independence movement, The Role of Christians in the National Struggle for Freedom (2006) Later life Albuquerque died on June 2017 in Mumbai, aged 87.

Growing up in Berlin, he joined Jungspartakusbund and Sozialistischer Sch√ºlerbund in 1927. In 1929, he joined the KJVD-O, youth organization of the just-established KPDO. In 1933, he just made it to finish his Abitur, but had to emigrate as a consequence of Hitler's Machtergreifung. =Exile and return= Crossing the Saarland, he fled to a kibbutz in British Palestine. From there, he went to Dƒõƒç√≠n, Sudetenland in the northern Czechoslovak Republic in 1935, where he studied agricultural science. All the while, he was an active anti-fascist, producing and helping smuggle and distribute leaflets into near Germany. After the 1938 Munich Agreement, he fled on to Sweden, where he led structures of the KP-Opposition, and was active in the Landesgruppe Deutscher Gewerkschafter in Schweden (national organization of German unionists in Sweden).

In 2007, he became member of Die Linke. Bergmann authored, edited and translated more than 50 books pertaining to agronomics and the history of international proletarian movements. His contributions to the history of workers' movements were released by VSA-Verlag in Hamburg. Additionally, he authored a number of contributions for Historical-Critical Dictionary of Marxism.

Life Snell was born in Saltash, Cornwall, the only son of Commander John Skinner Snell, RN and his wife Harriet Cleverton and educated at Plymouth Grammar School, Finsbury Technical College and King's College, London. After working for four years from 1885 with Messrs. Woodhouse and Rawson he was appointed in 1889 a resident engineer at Messrs. Crompton and Co., where he worked on electrical supply projects in London and Stockholm. From 1892 he worked as assistant to General Charles Edmund Webber on electrical supply projects in Kensington and a number of country houses, before entering municipal service in London in 1893 as assistant electrical engineer in St Pancras during the construction of the Kings Road power station. In 1896 he transferred to Sunderland as Borough Electrical Engineer, additionally becoming Borough Tramways Engineer in 1896 after which he converted the tramway system to electric power. In 1906, he set up in business as a consulting engineer in Westminster, amalgamating with Preece and Cardew to form Preece, Cardew and Snell. During that time he served as an expert witness for the General Post Office in a case involving compensation payments to National Telephone Company, after which he was given a knighthood (in 1914). He also acted as President of the Institute of Electrical Engineers for 1914. During the First World War he served on a number of committees, including the Munitions Inventions Committee. After the war he left the consulting company (by then Preece, Cardew, Snell and Rider) to advise the government of matters of electrical supply. He helped to set up the Electricity Commission and served as its first chairman from 1919 to 1938, during which time the Central Electricity Board was established, the national grid created and the supply of electricity standardised.

These corpora are made available through the Sketch Engine corpus manager. There are TenTen corpora for more than 35 languages. Their target size is 10 billion (1010) words per language, which gave rise to the corpus family's name. In the creation of the TenTen corpora, data crawled from the World Wide Web are processed with natural language processing tools developed by the Natural Language Processing Centre at the Faculty of Informatics at Masaryk University (Brno, Czech Republic) and by the Lexical Computing company (developer of the Sketch Engine).  Corpus linguistics  In corpus linguistics, a text corpus is a large and structured collection of texts that are electronically stored and processed. It is used to do hypothesis testing about languages, validating linguistic rules or the frequency distribution of words (n-grams) within languages. Electronically processed corpora provide fast search. Text processing procedures such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and word- sense disambiguation enrich corpus texts with detailed linguistic information. This enables to narrow the search to a particular parts of speech, word sequences or a specific part of the corpus. First text corpora were created in the 1960s, such as the 1-million-word Brown Corpus of American English. Over time, many further corpora were produced (such as the British National Corpus and the LOB Corpus) and work had begun also on corpora of larger sizes and covering other languages than English. This development was linked with the emergence of corpus creation tools that help achieve larger size, wider coverage, cleaner data etc.  Production of TenTen corpora  The procedure by which TenTen corpora are produced is based on the creators' earlier research in preparing web corpora and the subsequent processing thereof. At the beginning, a huge amount of text data is downloaded from the World Wide Web by the dedicated SpiderLing web crawler. In a later stage, these texts undergo cleaning, which consists of removing any non-textual material such as navigation links, headers and footers from the HTML source code of web pages with the jusText tool, so that only full solid sentences are preserved. Eventually, the ONION tool is applied to remove duplicate text portions from the corpus, which naturally occur on the World Wide Web due to practices such as quoting, citing, copying etc.  TenTen corpora data structure  TenTen corpora follow a specific metadata structure that is common to all of them. Metadata is contained in structural attributes that relate to individual documents and paragraphs in the corpus. Some TenTen corpora can feature additional specific attributes. = Document attributes = *top-level domain ‚Äì domain at the highest level of the hierarchical Domain Name System (e.g. \\"com\\") *website ‚Äì identification string defining a realm of administrative autonomy within the Internet (e.g. \\"wikipedia.org\\") *web domain ‚Äì collection of related web pages (e.g. \\"la.wikipedia.org\\") *crawl date ‚Äì date when the document was downloaded from the Web *url ‚Äì the Uniform Resource Locator referring to the document's source *wordcount ‚Äì number of words in the document *length ‚Äì classification of the document into a range by its length measured in thousands of words = Paragraph attributes = *heading ‚Äì a numeric attribute distinguishing headers and similar titles from ordinary body text (1 if the paragraph is a heading, 0 otherwise)  Available TenTen corpora  The following corpora can be accessed through the Sketch Engine as of October 2018:  See also  * Text corpus * Sketch Engine * Web crawler (spider) * Data deduplication  References   External links  * TenTen Corpus Family (at the Sketch Engine website) Corpora Commercial digital libraries Czech digital libraries ","title":"TenTen Corpus Family"},{"id":"54292123","text":"Ashtown is a suburb of Kumasi in the Ashanti Region of Ghana.

The goal of S-ROI is to make risk-opportunity assessments more robust by providing new visibility into intangible internal costs and benefits, and externalities - social, economic, and environmental effects that are typically not considered in traditional cash-oriented project planning. Because it includes environmental impacts, S-ROI is distinct from the similarly named methodology of Social Return on Investment (SROI).  Overview and Cost Types  A fundamental principle of S-ROI is the creation of monetized models of non-cash benefits and costs. Benefits might include emissions avoided, resources saved, or improvements in health and productivity, while costs could include adverse effects on public health, risk associated with rising costs for resources or disposal, or impacts of a project on nearby farms, fisheries, or tourism sites. Quantifying these factors documents intangible values of an investment, and allows them to be incorporated into the decision-making process alongside traditional financial ROI metrics, providing additional insight, confidence, and transparency. S-ROI findings can also be used in support of requests for public or private funding of projects Like its predecessor methodology, Total Cost Assessment (TCA), S-ROI considers five different cost types. The first two, Direct and Indirect Costs, are the same as in traditional ROI, and include benefits, such as revenue increases. The third cost type, Contingent Liabilities, includes risks (such as fines, penalties, clean-up, etc.) which are not certain, but are easy to see in a financial statement should they occur. The last two cost types, Internal and External Intangibles are not easy to see in the financial statement, but represent real costs nonetheless. Internal costs are costs to the company, such as loss of brand value, or poor productivity stemming from low morale. External costs, also known as negative externalities, are costs to society, such as environmental degradation and effects on housing prices. In all categories, S-ROI also considers benefits, a category that was ignored in TCA.  History and Evolution from Total Cost Assessment (TCA)  Sustainability Return on Investment (S-ROI) grew out of the Total Cost Assessment (TCA) methodology, codified by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). TCA was first considered by General Electric in the late 1980s for better selection and justification of waste- management investment decisions. The US and New Jersey Environmental Protection Agencies then commissioned the Tellus Institute to investigate and apply the methodology to several projects in the early 1990s. While this work showed promise, members of the Center for Waste Reduction Technologies at the AIChE felt the method needed a better-defined protocol. A team of 13 industry experts worked with consultants from Arthur D. Little to develop a process for conducting a Total Cost Assessment and published a workbook describing the method in 2000. The initial methodology was designed to include direct and indirect environmental and safety costs into a corporate assessment of a decision. The methodology was devised by industry collaborators for use in industry and had a vetting period, during which the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of Fortune 500 companies in the chemical industry were brought in to ensure the financial calculations met their stringent requirements. Although the initial methodology had a narrow scope and focus, practitioners have found that the basic method can be applied beyond environmental and safety costs to include health risks, societal costs, and benefits in all categories. Several practitioners and government and industry partners continued the development of the methodology to include benefits and the multi-stakeholder perspective that are included in the S-ROI concept.  Process and Applications  An initial data-gathering phase typically involves concurrent dialog with stakeholders inside and outside the project-planning organization, or proxies for these groups, to identify types of impacts from the project under consideration. Examples of stakeholders for a factory project could include employees, suppliers, area residents, emergency responders, and local government. It is important in this process that stakeholders hear what other stakeholders and the decision-maker are saying, to foster mutual understanding and create otherwise-impossible arrangements that satisfy the needs of the most-critical groups (i.e., to optimize the decision). Stakeholder inputs are used to quantify uncertainties and evaluate benefits and costs under different scenarios. These findings can then be incorporated into a probabilistic modeling process to systematically identify possible events that could affect an investment's payback, assess the consequences, and identify opportunities for optimizing overall outcomes. A Net Present Value (NPV) assessment can be made for each stakeholder, using Monte Carlo analysis to generate best-case, worst-case, and most-likely assessments of an investment's profitability. One example would be the possible replacement of a dangerous chemical with a more benign alternative. The S-ROI process can evaluate possible effects of industrial accidents, including the risk of fines, lawsuits, and damage to brand reputation and employee relations. These types of analyses can show whether preventive measures like extra training or redundant safety systems create an unnecessary burden or provide payback through risk reduction. Other examples are S-ROI of waste to energy facilities and implementation of a system for recycling waste generated during the production of concrete for construction projects. The S-ROI analysis assessed payback by analyzing up- front and operational costs, cost savings from reduced water usage and waste disposal, and potential scalability of the program. The S-ROI method can also be used to explore broader issues. Dow Chemical has used S-ROI, and its precursor TCA, to assess its 10-year sustainability goals over the last three cycles. The assessment helps the company justify what might seem to be low- return policies and select and optimize goals for the best return to all stakeholders.

She was a co-founder of the progressive Mormon women's journal Exponent II, from 1974, and its longest-serving editor, from 1984 to 1997, and involved in its long-running program of retreats. She has operated the Anam Cara Writer's and Artist's Retreat in West Cork, Ireland, for over twenty years, hosting and supporting more than 1,000 writers and other creative artists. Before her editorial career, while a high school English teacher, she was one of two plaintiffs in a successful legal action over discrimination against female staff by her employer when she was pregnant in 1971, winning a declaration of unconstitutionality in US Federal court. Life =Early life= Susan Larson was born to Clinton F. (1919-1994) and Naomi Larson (n√©e Barlow) (1923-2010) of Provo, Utah, U.S.; her grandfather was the athlete Clinton Larson. Her father was an academic at Brigham Young University, and a poet and playwright; he was the university's poet-in- residence for many years. She has one sister, Diane Larson Porter, a pianist, writer, and retired hospice nurse. The family were active Mormons, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. =Early career= Virginia Larson studied at Brigham Young University (BYU), qualifying with a degree in English and Political Science, and with a Secondary Teaching Certificate. She started her teaching career, in Utah, in 1966, in December of which year she also married John Monroe Paxman, at the Salt Lake City Temple. The couple moved to Charlottesville, Virginia in 1969, after John Paxman became a student at the University of Virginia School of Law. She held teaching posts in local schools. After being denied a routine renewal of contract as an English teacher at Albemarle High School in summer 1971 due to a pregnancy with a due date in December, she, as the family's main breadwinner, had to find new work. She took a job as an office manager of a research lab at the University of Virginia Medical School, working up to her last week of pregnancy and returning one month later. The Paxman-Gough constitutional case Paxman, who stated that she had been surprised by the restrictive Virginia maternity rules, as those in Utah had been more flexible, and shocked when the county school board upheld the initial decision, became one of two plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging rules across Virginia around employment discrimination due to pregnancy, winning a declaration of the unconstitutionality of such rules in 1975, and damages to include lost pay, but, on appeal, concluded in 1980, losing recompense other than an entitlement to reinstatement and partial cover for legal fees. While originally certified as a class action potentially including all pregnant teachers in the state, it was later decertified, but after an early ruling in the case, in 1972 the discriminatory rules were dismantled statewide anyway. =Massachusetts= The Paxmans moved to and lived for an extended period in the greater Boston area, including in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Exponent II Paxman was a member of the team producing Exponent II, a magazine by, and largely for, Mormon women, from its inception, and on the masthead from the second issue, in October 1974. She remained heavily involved until 1997, and in some form after,, even to the present. She served as its fourth Editor from spring 1984 until 1997, as Susan L. or Sue Paxman until 1996, then as Sue Booth-Forbes. The magazine addressed a wide range of issues, including feminism, reproductive rights, peace campaigns and other aspects of the roles and potential of women. Eliza Dushku Along with several family members, Paxman served as on-set guardian (a Screen Actors Guild-mandated role) for actress Eliza Dushku, from her first serious film performance (This Boy's Life) - her mother, Judy Rasmussen Dushku, a fellow Mormon from the same region and a friend, was also on the Exponent II team. In 1993 she was present for three weeks in this role during filming of True Lies, and she backed Eliza Dushku when she, many years later, alleged an off-set sexual assault by a member of the production team - which Dushku at the time reported only to her mother, a brother, and a different family friend - and commented on the overall industry situation at that time. Other work When living in England, Booth-Forbes also worked for the Cambridge University Press. Just prior to moving to Ireland, she worked as communications director for a quasi- public agency in Boston. =Ireland= With a divorce, after over 30 years, due to finalise in November 1997, and looking for a new direction, and having led multiple retreats linked to Exponent II, Booth-Forbes joined in a month- long literary retreat with friends, including Mary Lythgoe Bradford, in Connemara in August 1997, In December 1997 she searched with her daughter and purchased a property near the small village of Eyeries in West Cork, on the Beara Peninsula, launching a residential creative retreat, Anam Cara Writer's and Artist's Retreat, in June 1998. Over twenty-one years, more than 1,000 creative guests - writers, composers, choreographers, visual artists - have been on retreat, leaving more than 500 books on the shelves and paintings on the walls in the common areas of the retreat. The retreat itself is at the centre of a multi-acre space with more than thirty private working nooks and crannies, some on the landscaped riverbank. Booth-Forbes describes her work with some guests as that of a \\"literary midwife\\" and also says that the retreat format is partly modeled on the way her mother looked after her poet father. Several guests have dedicated work to Anam Cara and to her. Aside from her work as director of the Anam Cara Retreat, Booth-Forbes remains active in local fundraising and creative activities, as well as promotion and news- gathering for the local area. Personal life Booth-Forbes has two children, three grandchildren, and five nephews and nieces. She became an Irish citizen in 2012.

A winner of multiple national and international prizes and awards, including the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing in 2004, 2013 and 2019, the choir performs in various events both in Latvia and worldwide, and collaborates with renowned musicians and orchestras.  Staff  Since September 2018, the artistic director and chief conductor of the choir is Aivis Greters. The former artistic directors of the choir are its founder MƒÅris Sirmais (1990-2012) and JƒÅnis Liepi≈Ü≈° (2012-2018). The choir's managing director is Madara Ambrƒìna, and project manager - Edgars Skarbulis. Corporate relations manager is Andris Vecrumba. The choir has two vocal coaches: Ansis Sauka un Jolanta Strikaite-Lapi≈Üa. Ansis Sauka works mostly with the male voices, and Jolanta Strikaite-Lapi≈Üa with the female voices. Jolanta became a vocal coach in 2016, after the retirement of Aina BajƒÅre, who had been working with the choir since its founding in 1990. The second conductor of \\"Kamƒìr...\\" is Patriks KƒÅrlis Stepe. Former second conductors are AinƒÅrs Rubiƒ∑is, MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° Ozoli≈Ü≈° and Inita Kamar≈´te.  Achievements  Since its inception in 1990, \\"Kamƒìr...\\" has won numerous multiple national and international choir competitions, prizes and awards: * 1st prize at the International Chamber Choir Competition Marktoberdorf in Germany (1999);Internationaler Kammerchor- Wettbewerb Marktoberdorf 1989 - 2013 - Liste der Preistr√§ger (Page 7, in German) * Winner of the International Harald Anders√©n Chamber Choir Competition in Finland (2016); * 3-time winner of the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing in Goricia (2004) and Arezzo (2013 & 2019); * 3 championship prizes and gold medals at the World Choir Games in Xiamen, China (2006); * 6-time consecutive and current winner of Latvian Song festival \\"Choir wars\\" (1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018). \\"Kamƒìr...\\" has also been awarded the Latvian Great Music Award twice: * 1999: for high achievements in three choir competitions in Germany and Austria and for successful promotion of Latvian music and performing arts abroad; * 2005: for the idea and performance of the project \\"Latvija ‚Äì Saules zeme\\" (Latvia - Land of the Sun).  Notable projects  In recent years, Kamƒìr‚Ä¶ has developed programs specially commissioned for the choir. Its biggest project to date is World Sun Songs (2008), which featured 17 new choral works inspired by the sun; the project included such world-renowned composers as Sir John Tavener, Giya Kancheli, Sven-David Sandstr√∂m, Leonid Desyatnikov, John Luther Adams, Stephen Leek, Dobrinka Tabakova, Ko Matsushita, and others. Other examples of this concept have included the cycles Madrigals of Love (2010), Moon Songs (2012), and Amber Songs (2014), in which several celebrated composers wrote choral miniatures on love, the moon, or arrangements of Latvian folk songs, respectively. The choir has also actively worked toward the goal of synthesizing genres and means of expression. Examples of this effort have included scenic and choreographed performances of Jersikas derƒ´ba (an oratorio by Lƒ´ga Celma), The Christmas Legend (a musical tale by ƒíriks E≈°envalds), and The Canticles of the Holy Wind (a large-scale scenic meditation by John Luther Adams). The choir‚Äôs diversity was on full display in its 25-year anniversary concert in May 2015 at the Latvian National Opera. In three commissioned song cycles, the choir showed its skill as a nuanced a cappella ensemble (E≈°envalds‚Äô In Bird‚Äôs Sleep), as a powerful stage group (Raimonds Tiguls‚Äô Legend About Us), and as a splendid collaborator with a professional orchestra (Gabriel Jackson‚Äôs Spring Rounds). Other stage partners of Kamƒìr... have included Gidon Kremer, Marta Sudraba, the orchestra Kremerata Baltica, Nicolas Altstaedt, Peter Schreier, Yuri Bashmet, Julius Berger, Maxim Rysanov, and many more. Almost all of the choir's original music as well as various choral classics in the choir's repertoire have been recorded in a series of highly praised CDs. The latest of these are O Salutaris, a collection of choral music by ƒíriks E≈°envalds, Moon Songs, a cycle of new works by Latvian composers, and Amber Songs, 17 arrangements of Latvian folk songs by international composers. The latter collection have been published in a sheet music book by Musica Baltica.  Artistic principles  Over the last twenty-five years, Kamƒìr... has achieved its sound by cultivating its own signature performance style. Both full emotional surrender, a characteristic of amateur singers, as well as the strictest criteria for vocal quality, are of equal importance for the choir. This is expressed in the ellipsis encoded in the choir's name, Kamƒìr..., which means \\"while\\" in English. This entails the motto: \\"While we are still young, anything is possible.\\" Many of the choir's singers are highly skilled and experienced, a significant share of them also music students. This generally high level of vocal and musical skill helps maintain internal competition among the voice groups, which in turn ensures a high musical quality overall. Despite the perfectionism and attention to detail that sometimes goes even beyond professional standards, the choir is essentially amateur, its singers having other full-time occupations. Thus, musical education or previous choir experience is not a prerequisite for singing in Kamƒìr... The choir begins a new season every September, when it holds auditions for new singers. These candidates are evaluated with regard to their vocal and pitch abilities. A high level of skill and experience is not obligatory, as the choir's vocal coaches later help develop the new singers' skills, as long as they exhibit enough talent, ability and commitment. The aforementioned core values of the choir - emotional surrender and vocal quality - are both tested before every major concert programme, in individual singing examinations called AtdziedƒÅ≈°ana. There, the choir members are asked to perform all the pieces individually, and the choir conductors and vocal coaches then make a decision about the lineup for the concert, based on the singers' performance in this examination.

Dolly Rudeman (born Gustave Adolphine Wilhelmina R√ºdemann, 3 February 1902 ‚Äì 26 January 1980) was a Dutch graphic designer who produced posters for some of the most famous directors and film stars of her day, including Sergei Eisenstein, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo. Born in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) to Dutch parents, her father died before she was born and her mother took the family back to the Netherlands when Rudeman was in her teens. Rudeman studied art and drawing from an early age, and in the early 1930s embarked on a career in design. Concerned that there was little financial stability in art, she turned towards the medium of poster design. In the twenties, she was the only woman designing posters for the film industry, and was a prolific designer of posters and printed programs for the Netherlands Cinema Trust. Although work dried up during the Second World War‚Äîduring which she aided Jews hiding from the occupying Nazis‚Äîshe returned to poster design after the war. The 1950s have been termed her 'golden age', and during this decade she expanded into other forms of design such as for postcards, chocolate boxes, and ceramics. She never achieved the fame that she had before the war, however, and died in relative obscurity in Amsterdam in 1980. Early life Dolly Gustave Adolphine Wilhelmina R√ºdeman was born on 3 February 1902 in Salatiga, Java. She was the second child to Adolf Rudeman, a sugar factory proprietor, who died six months before Dolly's birth, and his wife, Gerardina van Elsbroek. After Adolf's death Gerardina remarried, and the family moved to Batavia, in the Dutch East Indies. By 1916 they had moved to The Hague. Rudeman had one sister, who spent much of her life in Indonesia; they had very little contact in adulthood. Rudeman attended high school for two years before joining the Hague Drawing Institute where she studied art. She later moved to The Hague's Royal Academy of Art, where, in August 1922, she obtained a teaching certificate in drawing. A classmate of Rudeman's later recalled that most of the class \\"went on to be more or less unknown\\" and \\"became housewives\\", while Rudeman, now in her twenties, was \\"already riding around on a motorbike\\". Initially, she considered a career in portraiture, but decided against it on the grounds, as she explained some years later, that she was \\"not well-off, and most Dutch people consider it a scandalous waste of money to have yourself painted.\\"  Early career  Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin in 1926. Rudeman enrolled at the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten (the Royal Academy of Art) in The Hague and studied drawing, graduating in 1922. Wanting to design posters, she travelled to England to study under the illustrator and cartoonist, Charles Exeter Devereux Crombie. In the mid-1920s, having returned to the Netherlands, she began drawing posters for the Netherlands Cinema Trust. Having moved into her own studio, she taught private pupils and produced general illustrations. Rudeman's first poster‚Äîand one of the most famous of this period, which made her name‚Äîwas the \\"vicious Cossack\\" for Eisenstein's 1925 movie Battleship Potemkin. A then-unheard of 7,500 copies were printed for the film's promotion. At the time it was \\"virtually unheard of\\" for Dutch film promoters to produce a particular poster for a single show, and they often resorted to the expediency of merely painting over the titles of foreign-produced posters. Het Vaderland, a Dutch evening newspaper, published from 1869 to 1982, declared that the \\"designer of the poster must be of the same persuasion [gender] as the director of the film.\\" That same year, Rudeman was offered a permanent contract with the Netherlands Cinema Trust, and so achieved financial security. Rudeman also designed many program covers, producing about seventy between 1926 and 1927. In 1928 she left for Paris, where she worked under the painter Cassandre. The following year saw her travel to Berlin. In the course of her career she created posters for Marlene Dietrich (in Dishonored), Greta Garbo, and Asta Nielsen, comedians Charlie Chaplin (for City Lights) and Buster Keaton's The General, as well as for some who declined into obscurity, such as Dolores del R√≠o (The Loves of Carmen and Ramona). In 1928 Rudeman attended the International Film Exhibition at The Hague, and that same year she received a major commission to redesign the many wall paintings and lampshades at the Cin√©ma Palace, a movie theatre in Groningen. This was despite her complete lack of experience with interior design. The results were well received; coverage ranged from in-house, cinematic trade publications to popular women's magazines such as Het Rijk der Vrouw. The latter wrote that although the local community was \\"highly conservative in their taste [they] learned to appreciate her ultra-modern work.\\" The magazine also wrote that although in post-war Europe they were \\"used to seeing women in men's jobs... It was a surprise... when we saw Dolly Rudeman's posters and learnt that this was the work of a woman!\\" The same year her poster for Charlie Chaplin's The Circus became the flrst poster to win the Dutch government's official seal of approval. The Cinema Trust commissions dried up for Rudeman when Barend Lugend, from whom Rudeman had received some of her earliest commissions, left the organisation in 1929. Of her work until 1932, an estimated 150 posters and 70 programs remain. She continued to produce special assignments, and was exhibited as a solo artist and in group shows. Rudeman had to work quickly in producing her posters. She had no time to actually see the films she was illustrating because her posters had to be out before the films they depicted. All she had to work with was a script scenario and sometimes a photograph of the stars. Sometimes she had to work on two or three posters per week, in addition to other work designing chocolate boxes, letterheads, packaging and magazine designs, and on one occasion, a luxury wall calendar. The Hotel Krasnapolsky in Amsterdam (in 2016), the site of Rudeman's second exhibition in 1927 = Exhibitions = The first time Rudeman's work was exhibited was in a one-day exhibition on 17 October 1927 in Amsterdam. The show was a success, to such an extent that trade paper De Reclame lamented the fact that it was so short. A follow-up exhibition opened on 31 October 1927 in the Hotel Krasnapolsky. One of the major exhibitions of her career was held in February 1931 at the White House, opposite the Peace Palace, also in Amsterdam. This was an \\"extremely exclusive\\" gallery operating on an invitation-only basis, and had the benefit of not only promoting Rudeman and her work, but the cinema poster as a form of art in itself. Rudeman was, a contemporary commented, \\"mounting a courageous front against the bad taste of the film poster.\\" Her original work was on sale for between 75 and 500 guilders . Post-war career and death One of her last works before the outbreak of World War II was a work commissioned by the Committee for Warning Against Unilateral Disarmament. This was an evocative piece, illustrating \\"a pale man, symbolising the despair, fear and self-reproach of a defenceless war victim. A slipping national flag is the only thing covering his naked body. Behind him stand ruined, burning buildings.\\" During the war, poster production was halted, partly due to a lack of basic materials but also because a number of people in the industry were deported under the Nazi occupation of Holland. Rudeman continued to live in The Hague, but was forced to relocate temporarily to Amsterdam twice, in 1941 and 1944, due to allied bombing raids. The second occasion saw her remain in Amsterdam for good. In Amsterdam, Rudeman lived with her cousin, Prul Rudeman. During the occupation, they took in a Jewish man named Rubens, who hid behind one of the Rudemans' cupboards when there was a police raid. They successfully kept him hidden from the Nazis until the end of the war. She stayed in touch with Lugend too, who would bring a hare for their annual Christmas meal; friends of Rudeman's from her early days at the Academy also joined them. Rudeman's post-war career was mainly built around postcards, portraits and watercolours, as well as some posters, particularly for the K.N.M.V Motor Races. The 1950s, in fact, have been described as Rudeman's Golden Age; she received many good commissions, and worked for Organon (in Oss) and Mulder and Zoon in Amsterdam, which further spread her work in America. Her work at this time included decals for porcelain, jugs, vases, and the like. She also contributed illustrations for picture books (not only works such as Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales, but her own children's publications). Her partnership with Mulder ended in the 1970s, and Rudeman concentrated on children's portraits on private commission. She never again, however, received the national publicity and attention that she had before the war; likewise, it has been suggested, she never found the artistic freedom she wanted. Rudeman died in Amsterdam on 21 January 1980 of pulmonary emphysema. There were no obituaries. =Late twentieth-century popularity= Although Rudeman died in relative obscurity‚Äî\\"and her interesting work, her hundreds of film posters, seemed lost\\"‚Äîtowards the end of the century the Dutch film poster archives received a thorough inventory, in which many of her pieces were rediscovered. This led to renewed interest in her work and a major 1985 exhibition in the United States, The Modern Dutch Poster: The First Fifty Years, at which her Battleship Potemkin was displayed. Artistic style and criticism Rudeman was known for her \\"bold, futuristic style\\", being both \\"austere and dynamic,\\" and the influence of early German Expressionism on her work has been noted. Although constrained by being able to work only from film stills, her portrait style has been described as \\"exchanging realism... for a suggestive atmosphere.\\" In 1929, contemporary journalist Kate de Ridder wrote of Rudeman's work that, whereas a female artist's work usually demonstrated a feminine touch, Rudeman's bold style was far less so. De Groene Amsterdammer described her design for Battleship Potemkin as making \\"a strong impression,\\" whilst Het Vaderland, from The Hague, noted how \\"boldly drawn\\" it was, suggestive of the work of as much an artist as those who made the film itself. The same newspaper incorrectly ascribed the poster for Potemkin to a man, and corrected this in a lengthy article describing the artist and her work, in which she was called a promising young woman. Later commentators have noted the emphasis by contemporary newspapers (such as Het Vaderland) on Rudeman's youth. The same newspaper also described the film industry's advertising as \\"the epitome of ugliness,\\" consisting of \\"gaudy sheets... overloaded with letters... clumsily drawn.\\" In contrast, Rudeman's work made an immediate impact in the national press; her work was popularly seen as being in tune with the \\"modernity\\" of the twenties. Her style and works have been compared favourably to many of her contemporaries, including Ludwig Hohlwein, Hap Hadley in the United States and the Stenberg brothers in the Soviet Union. It has been defined as possessing three main identifying features: \\"good taste, a feel for colour and originality.\\" =Major works= Rudeman herself believed she had designed over 250 film posters in her career. It has been estimated that only about half of her oeuvre has survived, of which at least 90 are extant in public and private collections. Her works include: *The Battleship Potemkin (1925): Expressionist in style, it depicts the Odessa massacre scene. *Spanish Evening (1926): Commissioned by the Scheveningen Sea Bathing Company to promote its resort, and starring La Argentina. *Employment Agency for Inland Shipping (1927): Commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, it is possible that she deliberately used \\"the image language and symbolism\\" of socialism. *The Circus (1928): Influenced by her time working in A. M. Cassandre's studio, she drew Chaplin's face \\"with as few lines as possible.\\" *Papitoe, Siren of the Tropics (1928): The first Hollywood film with an all- black cast; Rudeman's illustration showed the 'Black Pearl,' Josephine Baker. *The Jazz singer (1928): Illustrated Al Johnson made up as a black minstrel. *Wings (1928): Portrayed a \\"dramatic aviator in the shadow of an airplane; this earned critical acclaim even in the United States.\\" *Don Quichotte (1933): A portrait of the star of the film, Feodor Chaliapin, and also Rudeman's final film poster. *Have You Got Your Celebration Skirt Yet? (1946): Her first post-liberation work, promoting the skirt designed by Elisabeth Hannema-van Maasdijk made out of scrap fabric.

They are regarded as one of the most influential street bands in the past few years, and considered early pioneers of using the caj√≥n drum as a replacement for a full drum kit. The quartet is known for mixing genres and singing in both English and Danish, and their musical style is inspired by blues, funk, reggae, folk and early rock and roll. Career While Brothers Moving stuck to their roots and independence as street musicians, they quickly began gigging regularly in smaller clubs, at private parties and at fashion events in and around New York City. In 2009, they passed auditions for the MUNY (Music Under New York) membership. Although Brothers Moving didn't get much attention in their home country, the bands popularity has grown in other places. This is in large part due to a video filmed on a cellphone by a spectator in Union Square, NY, which captured the band performing the Cab Calloway classic ‚ÄúMinnie The Moocher‚Äù during one of their street sets. In 2016 they headlined their debut concerts in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which appeared to sell out and were well received by the public.

History The Hah√≥ti family originated from the Arnold branch of the notable gens Hah√≥t. According to the fourteenth-century chronicle composition, the founder of the kindred, knight Hahold descended from the Counts of Orlam√ºnde, arriving to Hungary in 1163 upon the invitation of Stephen III to help to defeat the rebelled Cs√°k kindred. Hahold's great-grandson Keled served as Vice-ban of Slavonia in 1234. He had two children Keled II and Violant. Keled II was mentioned as a \\"royal man\\" in 1275. He is considered as the first member of the Hah√≥ti family, descended from the Arnold branch, as a royal charter from 1277 referred to him as Hah√≥ti (lit. \\"of Hah√≥t\\"). During that time, he inherited a part of Nick from his kindred and involved in a lawsuit against the J√°k clan and his own cousin, Nicholas III Hah√≥t. The last male member of the family John died in 1376 without heirs. On 13 March 1377, King Louis I of Hungary granted the status of a son to his only daughter Anne who married Nicholas de Surdis (or Lipoveci), a nephew of John de Surdis, Archbishop of Esztergom. The members of the S√∂jt√∂ri (or also Hah√≥ti) family protested against the method and filed a lawsuit in the royal court, without success. =Family tree= *Keled (fl. 1270‚Äì77)  Arnold (fl. 1293‚Äì1327)  Michael (fl. 1293‚Äì1327), married Elizabeth N (fl. 1360) * Nicholas (fl. 1331‚Äì51) * John (fl. 1331‚Äì76), married Helen N (fl. 1360‚Äì80)  Anne (fl. 1360‚Äì1412); praefectio in filium, married Nicholas de Surdis * a daughter, married John Berzencei * a daughter, married John Balai from the gens Szal√≥k Other Hah√≥tis The S√∂jt√∂ri (or Falkosi) family of the Buz√°d branch, which descended from Herbord, son of Lancelot, was frequently also called as \\"Hah√≥ti\\" throughout the 14th century by royal charters.

Formamide (NH2CHO), the simplest naturally occurring amide, contains all the elements (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen), which are required for the synthesis of biomolecules, and is a ubiquitous molecule in the Universe. Formamide has been detected in galactic centers,, star-forming regions of dense molecular clouds, high-mass young stellar objects, the interstellar medium, comets,,, and satellites. In particular, dense clouds containing formamide, with sizes on the order of kiloparsecs, have been observed in the vicinity of the Solar System. Formamide forms under a variety of conditions, corresponding to both terrestrial environments and interstellar media: e.g., on high-energy particle irradiation of binary mixtures of ammonia (NH3) and carbon monoxide (CO), or from the reaction between formic acid (HCOOH) with NH3. It has been suggested that in hydrothermal pores formamide may accumulate in sufficiently high concentrations to enable synthesis of biogenic molecules. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that formamide could be a key intermediate of the Miller-Urey experiment as well. The combinatorial power of carbon is manifested in the composition of the molecular populations detected in circum- and interstellar media (see the Astrochemistry.net web site). The number and the complexity of carbon-containing molecules are significantly higher than those of inorganic compounds, presumably all over the Universe. One of the most abundant C-containing three-atoms molecule observed in space is hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The chemistry of HCN has thus attracted attention in Origin of Life studies since the earliest times, and the laboratory synthesis of adenine from HCN under presumptive prebiotic conditions was reported as early as 1961. The intrinsic limit of HCN stems from its high reactivity, which leads in turn, to instability and the difficulty associated with its concentration and accumulation in unreacted form. The ‚ÄúWarm Little Pond‚Äù in which life is supposed to have started, as imagined by Charles Darwin, and re-elaborated by Alexander Oparin, had most likely to reach sufficiently high concentrations to start creating the next levels of complexity. Hence the necessity of a derivative of HCN that is sufficiently stable to survive for time periods extended enough to allow its concentration in the actual physico-chemical settings, but that is sufficiently reactive to originate new compounds in prebiotically plausible environments. Ideally, this derivative should be able to undergo reactions in various directions, without prohibitively high energy barriers, thus allowing the production of different classes of potentially prebiotic compounds. Formamide fulfils all these requirements and, due to its significantly higher boiling point (210 ¬∞C), enables chemical synthesis in a much broader temperature range than water., Prebiotic chemistry Current living forms on Earth are essentially composed of four types of molecular entities: (i) nucleic acids, (ii) proteins, (iii) carbohydrates, and (iv) lipids. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) embody and express the genetic information and, together, constitute the genome and the apparatus for its expression (the genotype). Proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids form the structures, which harness and handle energy from the environment for organizing matter according to the instructions specified by the genotype, aiming to its conservation and transmission. The ensemble of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids constitute the phenotype. Life is thus made of the interaction of metabolism and genetics, of the genotype with the phenotype. Both are built around the chemistry of the most common elements of the Universe (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon), important although ancillary roles being played by phosphorus and sulphur, and by other elements. Given the overwhelming variety of the chemically conceivable molecules, the fact that in biological systems we observe only a small subset of organic molecules has raised questions how and which different reaction pathways could have plausibly lead to the synthesis of pre-biological molecules on the primordial Earth. These are the main objectives of prebiotic chemistry research. Precursor of biogenic molecules Figure 1. Relationship between formamide and other prebiotic feedstock molecules, such as HCN and ammonium formate(NH4+HCOO‚àí). Figure 1 summarizes the basic chemistry of formamide and its chemical connection with HCN and ammonium formate (NH4+HCOO‚àí), considering selected examples of preparative and degradative reactions. The synthesis of purine from formamide was first reported in 1980. A series of studies building on this observation was started 20 years later: the synthesis of a large panel of prebiotically relevant compounds (including purine, adenine, cytosine, and 4(3H)pyrimidinone) in good yields was reported in 2001. These products were obtained by heating formamide in the presence of simple catalysts such as calcium carbonate (CaCO3), silica (SiO2), or alumina (Al2O3). In addition to nucleobases, sugars, carboxylic acids, amino acids, as well as heterogeneous compounds of various classes, (including urea and carbodiimide) were also synthesized. The catalysts studied include, in addition to those mentioned, titanium oxides, clays, cosmic dust analogues, phosphates, iron sulphide minerals, zirconium minerals, borate minerals, or numerous materials of meteoritic origin , encompassing iron, stony-iron, chondrites, and achondrites meteorites. Various energy sources, including thermal energy, UV-radiation, irradiation with high-energy (terawatt) laser pulses, or slow protons were tested. Mimics of different formamide-based prebiotic scenarios have been reconstructed and analyzed, including space-wise solar wind irradiation of meteorites, dynamic chemical gardens, and meteorites in aqueous environments. It has been suggested that the stepwise decrease of the temperature of the prebiotic environment could induce a sequence of strongly non-equilibrium chemical events that led to the emergence of more and more complex species from formamide on the early Earth., For each studied combination of catalyst/energy source/environment, formamide condensed into a variety of different prebiotically relevant compounds, each combination giving rise to a specific set of relatively complex molecules, usually encompassing several nucleobases, amino acids, and carboxylic acids. The highest level of complexity was attained for the formamide/meteorite system, using proton irradiation as the energy source, where the one-pot synthesis of four nucleosides (uridine, cytidine, adenosine, thymidine) was observed. So far, no other one-carbon atom compound has shown the versatility of products that can be formed from formamide under plausible prebiotic conditions in a one-pot chemistry (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Main prebiotic building blocks that can be synthesized from formamide under plausible prebiotic conditions., In addition to its dual function of substrate and solvent in one-pot syntheses affording prebiotic compounds as complex as nucleosides and long aliphatic chains, it has been observed that formamide plays a role in the generation of molecules which are closer to the biological domain. In the presence of a phosphate source (e.g., phosphate minerals), formamide promotes the phosphorylation of nucleosides, leading to the formation of nucleotides,, and strongly stimulates the non- enzymatic polymerization of 3‚Äô,5‚Äô cyclic nucleotides, leading to the abiotic synthesis of RNA oligomers. This is the reason why formamide is considered a plausible medium for prebiotic phosphorylation reactions also in the ‚Äúdiscontinuous synthesis‚Äù scenario of the origin of life., References Prebiotic chemistry ","title":"Formamide-based prebiotic chemistry"},{"id":"54292639","text":"Trickfinger II is the second studio album by Trickfinger, the alias of musician John Frusciante, released on 8 September 2017 on the AcidTest label.

In 1935 he began university studies in architecture at Politecnico di Torino in its architecture division, completing his undergraduate studies in 1939 and his graduate work 1940. Concurrently, Gentili was also a student of the painter Felice Casorati until 1941. As a student in the late 1930s he formed a close, lasting friendship with the chemist and writer, Primo Levi, who knew him as \\"Euge\\" and with whom he shared a love of mountain climbing.Angier, p. 129  Architect  Eugenio Gentili Tedeschi in his Milan studio with two colleagues. Gentili's professional formation took place during the period when modern architecture and Rationalism were extremely influential in Italy, strongly promoted by the design magazine, Casabella and the writings of the magazine's editor Giuseppe Pagano and the publisher-art-critic-designer, Edoardo Persico. Persico held the 'Profezia dell'Architettura\\" conference (The Prophecy of Architecture) in Turin in January 1935, which the 19-year old Gentili attended. The 1930s also saw the rise of Fascism and the Italian Racial Laws promulgated in 1938, which banned Jews from academia, politics, finance, the professional world, and most sectors of public and private life. In 1941, Gio Ponti, one of Italy's leading designers of the day, in direct defiance of the law, hired Gentili.Angier, p 195. Gentili worked in Ponti‚Äôs studio until late 1943, when Gentili, who was active in the anti-fascist underground, was forced to flee Milan for his own safety.Angier, p. 219 [See below.] In early spring 1945, he moved to Rome, where, with Bruno Zevi, Cino Calcaprina, Saverio Muratori, Silvio Radiconcini, Mario Ridolfi, he co-founded Metron, the first architecture magazine published in Italy after the war. [See below.] In 1946, he opened his own practice in Milan, Studio Eugenio Gentili Tedeschi. In 1948 he was asked to join the MSA (Movimento di Studi per l'Architettura), the only architect in Italy to belong to both the Associazione per l‚Äôarchitettura organica (APAO) and MSA. He participated in the Milan Triennial in 1947, 1951 and 1954, eventually joining its board, where he remained active for many years. = Public buildings = * Heichal David u-Mordechai Synagogue - The original synagogue on via Guastalla was heavily damaged during the bombardments of Milan 1940-44, which had completely destroyed the interior, leaving only the facade. In 1946 the Jewish community of Milan opened a competition to Jewish architects, for the reconstruction of the building. The first prize was shared by Gentili and Manfredi d'Urbino. Under Gentili's management, the synagogue was rebuilt between 1951 and 1953. * Porta Garibaldi Station - In 1957 the Italian Railways and the City of Milan announced an architectural competition for the design of a new railway station in the location of Porta Garibaldi. Gentili, with a team that included Giulio Minoletti and Mario Tevarotto, tied for first prize for their design with the Roman architectural firm, Bonamico, F.&G.; Gigli and Janicelli). The two teams together developed the project for the new station, which was based mostly on the Milanese scheme. The station was completed in 1963. Tedeschi's spiral staircase, detail from the Italfarmaco headquarters, Milan. * Italfarmaco complex - This project won the IN-ARCH prize (Istituto Nazionale di Architettura) in 1963. In the influential Italian design magazine, DOMUS in 1963, Gio‚Äô Ponti praised the Italfarmaco project for its daring use of space, singling out the exterior spiral staircase for special praise: \\"The elevations of these stairs, their clarity and sharpness, their structural elegance, their design and \\"lines\\" encapsulate the values of this architecture, and in turn represent the values of Gentili's oeuvre as architect.\\" * LASA (Laboratorio Acceleratori Superconduttivit√† Applicata) - The LASA building was commissioned by the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics as a new center for scientific research capable of containing a large cyclotron. It was built between 1983 and 1987 in Segrate just outside Milan, on an area owned by the Universit√† degli Studi of Milan. The complex is composed of four connecting volumes that are of varying dimensions and heights: the office building with a square plan layout, the large hangar for the cyclotron and its control areas, the mechanical building and the workshop. * L.I.T.A. (Laboratorio Interdisciplinare di Tecnologie Avanzate) - L.I.T.A. was commissioned by the Universit√† degli Studi of Milan as a 24,000 square meter center for research and teaching of bio-medical sciences. It was built between 1987 and 1995 in Segrate, on an area adjacent LASA. *Orfanotrofio San Felice - The Monastery of San Felice (15-19th centuries), a monumental complex in the historic center of Pavia, which had been converted to an orphanage in the 18th century, was restored by E. Gentili Tedeschi, G.Calz√†, A.Savio Architect Associate in three phases from 1993 to 1999: restoration of the refectory and its annex, which became the library; reconfiguration of the three main wings and the main courtyard; and new construction around the east courtyard. Today the building is the seat of the Economics and Philosophy faculties of the University of Pavia, containing classrooms, libraries and offices. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  The former refectory of the Monastery of San Felice in Pavia, now part of the University of Pavia, school of engineering.  Design of the Monasterio restoration. } Towards the end of the 1990s the Studio Associato (Tedeschi with architects Gianni Calz√† and Andrea Savio) began the restoration of vintage movie theaters in Milan. A few historic ones, like the Ducale, Excelsior, Mignon and Arcobaleno in the center of Milan were transformed into multiplexes through respectful redesign that allows the classic structures to retain their original historic features. Teacher Gentili taught throughout his career as an architect. His began teaching in 1955, when he was invited to join Franco Albini, Ignazio Gardella and Ludovico Belgioioso as assistant at the Venice University Institute of Architecture, where he obtained professorship in 1959 teaching interior design with Albini. In 1964, he began teaching at the Politecnico di Milano in Milan, as professor of Architectural Composition, and then director of that department in 1972-73. He became a tenured professor there in 1981, where remained until his retirement in 1986. A collection of year of his architecture lectures at the Faculty of Architecture of the Politecnico di Milano was published as \\"Milano - i segni della storia\\" (Milan - the markings of history) in 1988 by Alinea, Florence. World War Two Years Tedeschi sketch of partisan capture of German troops on the Alps, 1944. Gentili took part in the Italian resistance movement and fought alongside the Partisans in the Aosta Valley (in northwestern Italy at the border with France). He was denounced in June 1944, arrested and imprisoned in Turin. He was released in a matter of weeks, after Gentili's father and girlfriend were able to raise the 30,000 lire needed to bribe the police superintendent in Turin to turn him free.Angier, pp. 438-439. In the winter of 1944/45 he managed to elude the Nazi roundups and crossed the Alps into France to safety. In early 1945, he returned to Italy with the Allied forces, going first to Rome.Angier page 439 His sketches from that period chronicle different aspects of the partisans' operations.  Publishing In Rome the spring of 1945, with Cino Calcaprina, Saverio Muratori, Silvio Radiconcini, Mario Ridolfi and Bruno Zevi, he was co- founder and publisher of Metron, the first postwar architecture magazine in Italy, and served on its editorial board. Later that year, he returned to Milan with the task of promoting Metron among local architects. Metron's influence was due to its close association with the Associazione Per l'Architettura Organica (A.P.A.O.) and became the platform advocating that Italian public architecture return to its organic roots‚Äîthat it be \\"modeled on the human scale,\\" in the words of Bruno Zevi, the principal proponent of \\"organic architecture\\". Gentili's longest lasting association in publishing was with Abitare, which he joined in 1961 and helped shape the character of for the following decade and a half. Abitare soon established itself as a leading design publication, featuring the works of, and publishing articles by, some of the leading architects, designers and artists of the day. When Tedeschi began his association with the founding publisher, Piera Perone, the magazine was called Casa Novit√†. Gentili and Perone relaunched it as Abitare in 1962 and featured an introductory article by Gentili and a main feature he commissioned on the work Gino Becker, a former colleague. He continued his close association with Abitare until 1976, working with subsequent editorial directors, including Franca Santi, with whom he shared the role of editor-in- chief for a period. He continued as a contributor to Abitare until 1979, writing some 40 articles for the magazine in all.  Books & Articles  * ‚ÄúElementi di Architettura‚Äù - ed.

In this museum, there are more than 2,000 different archaeological and architectural monuments ‚Äì mounds, seats of ancient settlements, burial places dating back to thousands of years ago. The reserve was established in the year of 2008 under the auspices of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. It is located in Qala, 40km far from Baku and bears the name of this district. Gala- State Historical Ethnographic Reserve is devoted to the history of the Absheron Peninsula. As a result of archaeological excavations, it is feasible to get the picture of the lifestyle of the Azerbaijani people from ancient times to the Middle Ages. There is an 18th- century tandoor, two underground passages belonging to the 10th and 15th centuries. Besides these, old houses, portable tents made of animal skins, stone and straw houses with domes, an old smithy, a pottery workshop, and a thresher can be found. All these can be touched and photographed.

In 2008, on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the Archeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex under the open sky was established. Archaeological architectural monuments discovered on the Absheron Peninsula were collected and restored here. The mounds, settlements and other architectural monuments of the 3rd-2nd millennium BC were built in the same way as before the era. Ancient mounds, grave stones, dwellings, quarries, places of worship and some other material cultural remains found in the territory of Absheron Peninsula reflect the mood of the previous millennia. One of the mound is called \\"Dubendi\\". The basis of this mound is the rug- shaped stone masonry. Tools made from sheep bones and stone were found in the Reserve area. The \\"Turkan\\" mound also consists of a ring-shaped stonework. There is also a quadrilateral hole in this mound. There are residues of water and food wells, coffee houses, ancient houses in the territory of the reserve. Archaeological excavations have been proven to be the Bronze Age settlement 5,000 years ago in the village of Gala. In the ancient village of Gala, there were a number of fields of art. One of them is pottery. Pottery products discovered during archaeological excavations in Galada are potentially interesting in terms of pottery. The ancient carpets, the tools used during the carpet weaving - the apron, the cloth, the scissors, the hooked knife. Rock paintings and caves dating back to the new stone Bronze Age were discovered during the archaeological excavations in the Agdash Plain, Khashakhun and Dubendi in the vicinity of Gala village in the east of Absheron.

Related to the Awassi  History  The Tunisian Barbarin descends from the Near East Fat-tailed. Two Italian breeds, the Barbaresca Siciliana of Sicily and the Laticauda of Calabria and Campania, are derived from it. In 1991 the total population in Tunisia was reported to be 5 million; in 1992, a population of 50 000 was reported in Algeria. In 2008, the Barbarin constituted about 60% of the overall sheep population in Tunisia, which was estimated to count approximately 4 million ewes.  Characteristics  The Barbarin is a coarse-wool breed, and is reared mainly for meat. It is particularly well adapted to the intense heat of desert areas, and can tolerate brackish water. The coat is white, and the face is either brick-red or black. The black face gives the animal better resistance to sunlight and to photosensitivity caused by eating Hypericum perforatum, \\"St. John's Wort\\". Apart from the two principal types, a further eight sub-populations have been identified within the breed. These include an all-black variant, and two \\"spectacled\\" sub-types with a white head and patches of colour only around the eyes and round the muzzle: the black-spectacled type is called sardi, and the red-spectacled one, sagaa.

Stagg made his live-action appearance on the first season of The Flash, played by William Sadler. Publication history Simon Stagg first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #57 and was created by Bob Haney and Ramona Fradon. Mark Waid, writer of the Metamorpho limited series, commented that \\"writing Simon Stagg was always a tightrope walk. On the one hand, you don't want him to be so comically evil that he's a cartoon. On the other hand, you have to remember that he's an absolute creep. The key to Stagg is not losing sight of the fact that he does most everything he does for the sake of his daughter, regardless of how insane those actions may look to us\\". Fictional character biography Simon Stagg is the unscrupulous owner and CEO of Stagg Enterprises and the father of Sapphire Stagg. Adventurer Rex Mason wanted to win the hand of Sapphire Stagg. Simon sent Rex to Egypt to retrieve a meteor referred as the Orb of Ra. Unbeknownst to Rex, Simon had his brutish Neanderthal bodyguard Java attack him and leave him for dead. Rex was near the Orb of Ra and was exposed to it leading to his transformation into Metamorpho. Sometime later, Simon Stagg tricked the Metal Men into attacking the Justice League and had Java detain Rocket Red #4 and Animal Man. It turned out that Rex had a baby, who harmed whatever it touched. Metamorpho handed the baby over to Simon, who became convinced he would now die, harmed like Java had been moments earlier. Simon came through unharmed since something in his genetic structure protected him just as it did with the baby's mother. Simon's stance softened, and everyone was allowed to go. Doc Magnus of the Metal Men offered his services to Simon in creating new arms for Java. On the way home, Metamorpho's friends were puzzled as to how he knew Simon would be unaffected by the child. Metamorpho indicates that he had hoped the baby would kill Simon. Java came upon Black Canary while searching for help for Sapphire. His story was that Sapphire and Joey, Metamorpho's son, had been caught in a lab explosion and merged into a single energy being who was taking revenge upon Simon Stagg's former colleagues.Birds of Prey #51. DC Comics. It is revealed that not only were Sapphire and Joey merged, but so was Simon and it was him who was directing the revenge. Black Canary realized that Java was actually Metamorpho, somehow affected to believe he was Java (the actual Java's murder was still a secret known only to the Staggs). The three were separated once more with Simon claiming to have been overcome by the energy itself and unable to control his actions. As the comic ends, he steps away from the joyous family reunion to check on a growing clone of the murdered Java.Birds of Prey #52. DC Comics. In the one-shot \\"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\\", Maxwell Lord is seen talking with Stagg on the phone.Countdown to Infinite Crisis #1. DC Comics. In the \\"Blackest Night\\" tie-in Weird Western Tales #71 (Mar 2010), Stagg appeals to Joshua Turnbull (great-great-grandson of Quentin Turnbull) for help in analyzing a Black Lantern ring that was found on the grave of Don Hall and transported by The Ray. He leaves before the Lanterns attack, and it is unclear whether he survived the event.Weird Western Tales #71. DC Comics. During the \\"Brightest Day\\" storyline, Simon Stagg is later contacted at his Canadian estate by Metamorpho when he and his fellow Outsiders Black Lightning, Geo-Force, Katana, and Owlman (Roy Raymond, Jr.) need a place to stay during the War of the Supermen storyline after accidentally being shot down.Outsiders Vol. 4 #30. DC Comics. Simon Stagg later placed Java's mind into the body of a Shaggy Man which was defeated by Freight Train.Outsiders Vol. 4 #35. DC Comics. In the \\"DC Rebirth\\", Simon Stagg opened up the portal to the Dark Multiverse and was trying to use Metamorpho transmuted into Nth Metal in order to close it. This attracted the attention of Mister Terrific and Plastic Man. When Mister Terrific tries to get Simon Stagg to close the portal, Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, and Metamorpho are sucked in.The Terrifics #1. DC Comics. Simon Stagg was present when Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, Metamorpho, and Phantom Girl made it back from the Multiverse.The Terrifics #2. DC Comics. Due to the effects of the Dark Multiverse energy, Mister Terrific concludes that they can't go their separate ways due to this bond. Simon Stagg threatened to sue for invading his lab, though Mister Terrific made a compromise where they would continue investigating at Simon Stagg's mansion.The Terrifics #3. DC Comics. In other media =Television= * Simon Stagg appeared in the Justice League animated series, voiced by Earl Boen. In the two-part \\"Metamorphosis\\", Stagg Enterprises sought to create a chemically altered individual known as 'Metamorpho' who could survive in harshest environments, pitching this idea to a board of executives after an oil accident had nearly killed three workers. Stagg had Java smuggle some mutagen samples for that into the country, but one of the containers ended up braking during the transport, and the leaked chemicals nearly causes a train wreck which was prevented by the Green Lantern. Like in the comics, his favorite employee Rex Mason was in love with his daughter Sapphire Stagg of whom Stagg was jealously protective. In order to \\"protect\\" his daughter, Simon decides to test out the chemicals on Rex, transforming him into a shape- shifting mutant upon trapping him in a tube the chemicals were emptied into, and later tricks him into fighting Green Lantern and the Justice League. Upon learning the truth, Rex went after Simon in which the first attempt had Rex frozen to below zero temperatures. Simon's men dispose of Metamorpho but the metahuman later brakes free. During his second confrontation with Metamorpho at his company, an accident renders Simon mindless, with his base desires ending up in some of his chemicals, creating a monstrous synthoid creature (with resemblance to Chemo) that rampages throughout Metropolis. When the synthoid was destroyed by Metamorpho, Stagg woke up in the hospital screaming. Stagg later made a non-voiced cameo in \\"Only a Dream\\" Part 1 among the villains in John Dee's dream. * Simon Stagg appears in Beware the Batman, voiced by Jeff Bennett. First appearing in \\"Hunted\\", he is among the corrupt executives hunted and kidnapped by Professor Pyg and Mister Toad for revenge after a land deal he was involved in resulted in severe damage to the environment. When Michael Holt and Alfred Pennyworth are captured, they and Stagg end up hunted by Pyg and Toad. Alfred ends up injured saving Stagg from a trap. Before Pyg and Toad can finish off the three captives, Batman arrives and fights Pyg and Toad while Alfred gets Stagg and Holt out. In the episode \\"Toxic\\", Stagg disapproved of Sapphire Stagg's relationship with the security guard Rex Mason and believed that he had bred his daughter to be better. Donning a ski mask, he set off an alarm and lured Rex into the lab in \\"Project Metamorpho\\" where he trapped Rex inside to be exposed to the chemicals. Upon Batman's arrival, Stagg fled the lab and deleted an incriminating security footage. Batman eventually learned the truth and told everything to Metamorpho in order to lure him back to Stagg Industries to be cured. Stagg allowed Batman access to Project Metamorpho where the antidote didn't work. After Metamorpho vanished, Stagg attempted to pin the blame of Metamorpho's death on Batman only for Batman to show Sapphire the footage of her father's role in Metamorpho's creation. Batman then leaves with plans to leave the incriminating footage of Stagg's role in Metamorpho's creation to the police. In \\"Allies\\", Stagg was mentioned by Tobias Whale to have been arrested by the police at the time when Tobias Whale's gang were robbing one of the Stagg Enterprise warehouses. In \\"Monsters\\", Batman suspects Stagg of hiring and providing thugs with armor and weapons to drive people out of Old Gotham and buy the territory for profit. He visits Simon in his cell at Blackgate Penitentiary, but Stagg denies being involved in the scheme. The culprit is later revealed to be Sapphire seeking to impress her father. Batman threatens her to stop while withholding Rex's survival from her. * In Arrow, Stagg Industries is mentioned as being one of Laurel Lance's law firm's biggest benefactors. STAGG, however, has decided to end its funding of the firm and places the firm at risk of shutting down until Tommy Merlyn steps in and helps. Stagg Industries is again mentioned as being a chemical plant that Firefly set on fire during a murder spree. This is the set where the Arrow first faces off against Firefly. * Simon Stagg appears in The Flash, portrayed by William Sadler.https://www.bustle.com/articles/43818-who-is-simon-stagg- the-flash-scientist-might-be-vital-to-the-future-of-star-labs This version acts as a philanthropist and inventor with more sinister underlying motivations, and is an old acquaintance of Harrison Wells. In \\"Fastest Man Alive\\", he is Danton Black's target as he stole research and took the credit, rendering Danton unable to save his own wife. The Flash ultimately saves Stagg from being killed by Black. This, in turn, causes Stagg to be fascinated with the Flash, seeking to exploit the speedster's powers like he did with former employee's research. However, Wells kills him so Stagg won't interfere with his own plans for the Flash. As of the episodes \\"Out of Time\\" and \\"Rogue Time,\\" Stagg's murder remains undiscovered and he is reported as missing with rumors that he has become reclusive. However, journalist Mason Bridge discovers Wells was the last person to see Stagg alive to which \\"Wells\\", who is actually Eobard Thawne, kills Bridge as well. * Simon Stagg appears in season three of Young Justice. In the episode \\"Triptych\\", Simon was behind the metahuman trafficking which is later exposed and resulted in his arrest. While in his prison cell, he is visited by Shade in jail to presumably kill him. =Video games= * Simon Stagg's Stagg Industries is referenced in DC Universe Online. When the players on the hero side find a Jade Jaguar Totem during their mission to stop Catwoman, a voice-over by Catwoman mentioned that she acquired it in Peru while trying to save the jaguars from Stagg Industries' sponsored murders. Stagg Enterprises' Gotham HQ can be found in the Otisburg section of Gotham City. * Simon Stagg appears in Batman: Arkham Knight, voiced by Phil Proctor. His in-game profile describes him as a philanthropist and entrepreneur from Central City who is researching airborne inoculation technology and has been accused of human rights violations. After interrogating the Penguin, Batman learns that the Arkham Knight has taken Barbara Gordon to Founder's Island where Stagg has his airship laboratories. Upon infiltrating one of Stagg's airships, Batman finds him being held against his will by the Arkham Knight's militia where they demand some specific files. After taking out the militia, Stagg tells Batman that his company has been developing Nimbus Generators, a clean power cell technology. Stagg then tells Batman that the Scarecrow is on the second airship. After a Joker-related hallucination as a result of the fear gas, some of the militia regain consciousness and bring Stagg to Scarecrow on the second airship. Batman later finds out that Stagg and Jonathan Crane were working on a project called Cloudburst until Stagg double-crossed him upon still seeing that Jonathan Crane is still operating as Scarecrow. When Stagg's cell is slowly filling with fear toxin, Batman had to work to free Stagg before his cell is filled with the fear toxin. After the militia guarding him are defeated, Batman demands an explanation from Stagg where he claimed that Scarecrow needed help with the Cloudburst. When the fear toxin kicks in, Stagg starts hallucinating that something is crawling all over him causing Batman to knock out Stagg. Batman later returns to the airship where he takes down the militia before finding Stagg's hiding spot after breaking out of his cell. Stagg tells Batman that the Cloudburst is surrounded by nimbus field and anything that doesn't run on a Nimbus Cell will be fried. Stagg allows Batman to \\"borrow\\" a Nimbus Cell. Batman then throws Stagg into another cell as he obtains a Nimbus Cell. After Batman rescues Barbara from Scarecrow and his militia and brings her to the GCPD, Stagg was put into the GCPD's supervillain holding cell thinking that the cops are insane when he has no idea what he has done to deserve being locked up in jail. Simon's audiotapes have his employee Dr. Alex Sartorious talking about Stagg's weapons development and how he collaborated with Scarecrow. =Comic Strips= * Simon Stagg appears in Dick Tracy in February 2018. He made a deal with Ghost Pepper to buy his restaurant Pepper's. However, Ghost backs out on the deal, poisons Simon, and takes his money.

The relations between Panama and the Qing dynasty began in 1909 and modern relations began on 2 January 1922 between Panama and the Beiyang government of China. Following the Chinese Civil War in 1949, relations were maintained in Taiwan and the other islands. After breaking off relations with the Republic of China in June 2017, Panama established diplomatic relations with the mainland government of the People's Republic of China. On 26 July 2017, PRC's Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the trade office of China in Panama has been upgraded to China's Embassy in Panama on 13 July and has started its business. On 13 June 2017, the government of Panama switched recognition from Taiwan to China, breaking all ties with the ROC. ‚ÄúHistory and socioeconomic reality‚Äù were cited as reasons. Varela said that the move was backed by diplomatic relationships dating from 1912 and that the move strengthened the existing relationships, despite the fact that those relationships were with the ROC, not the PRC.  History  It all began with a letter sent in 2015 to the Chinese government that, according to Isabel Saint Malo, Panama's vice president, was titled \\"Panama wants to make ties with China\\". The contents of the letter are kept confidential, as well as the reasons of why it was sent. It has also been kept confidential who delivered the letter and assisted in the switchover process, which is only described as \\"a distinguished member of the Chinese community living in Panama\\". The ex-ambassador of the US to Panama, John Feeley, said that he had asked Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela about the switchover in 2016 but Varela lied to him, saying that there were no plans to make the switchover. He also said that Varela did not tell him the truth until 1 hour before the nationwide announcement. Others questioned why the Panamanian government continues to use equipment donated by Taiwan. The Panamanian government initially gave no reason, later saying that one reason was because \\"China is the second largest user of the Panama Canal\\" and President Varela said it was because he \\"couldn't accept it anymore\\" and \\"that's what every responsible leader would do\\". The Panamanian government officially said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that the switchover was to comply with the one- China policy. The ROC government said that Panama was its \\"number one ally\\" and that it would not participate in Beijing's checkbook diplomacy. The Taiwanese government complained that Panama maliciously hid the switchover process until the last moment. In the first year of diplomatic relations, 19 treaties were signed. Varela said that its main purpose was to allow Chinese nationals to easily invest in Panama. Controversies over the sudden switchover, included lack of due process, unusually high levels of confidentiality, and the fact that a few weeks before the switchover, Taiwan had donated medical equipment to Panama. In 2018, the first flight from Beijing To Panama by Air China landed in Tocumen International Airport, with a technical stop in Houston. Varela called it a milestone in Panamanian aviation. Due to this new route, the Panamanian ministry of tourism expected at least 40,000 Chinese tourist visits per year. ‚ÄúHistory and socioeconomic reality‚Äù were cited as reasons. Varela said that the move was backed by diplomatic relationships dating from 1912 and that the move strengthened the existing relationships, despite the fact that those relationships were with the ROC, not the PRC. As a result, Panama City was almost immediately added to China's list of officially approved tourist destinations. The Chinese Communist Party (or government) has offered the Paname√±ista party-led government a free feasibility study for the planned 4th set of locks in the Panama Canal in order to gain a competitive advantage in bids for choosing the company to build the 4th set of locks, not to mention plans for a 1200-hectare industrial park in the Pacific coast and a 4-hectare campus in Amador near the Biomuseo to house the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s embassy in Panama. The Plans for the campus in Amador were later scrapped due to Heavy criticism over the fear that the Chinese flag will be seen before the Panamanian Flag in Cerro Ancon due to its position in Amador, thus potentially giving the idea that Panama is Chinese territory. The Chinese embassy in Amador was suggested by Varela, saying that \\"Amador has not been used properly, it's an area whose value has to rise.\\" Amador is widely believed to be unsuitable for an embassy, or for placing flags of countries other than Panama. There are also fears that Panama could turn into a conflict zone between the United States of America (US) and the People's Republic of China (PRC), due to Panama's strategic location. A Panamanian government agency later said that the switchover was because of Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen's violations and un- acknowledgement of the 1992 consensus regarding China, Taiwan and the One- china policy. Panamanian newspaper La Estrella questioned the reasons Varela initially gave for the switchover, like \\"China is the world's largest population and the 2nd largest economy and user of the Panama Canal\\", calling Varela's actions contradictory and saying that the reasons Varela gave were the reality Panama has lived under for decades, so those could not be regarded as valid reasons for the switchover. The same newspaper also says that China's plans in Latin America convince Latin American nations easily, with apparent benefits in the short term but with dependency in China in the long term and that China is silently invading other countries and Latin America in general. There are also concerns that, in the long term, Chinese investments may control the Panamanian economy. On December 2, Chinese president Xi Jinping visited Panama as part of a four-country tour, going first to Spain, then to Argentina for the G20, then to Panama and then to Portugalhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/chinese-president-xi- arrives-in-portugal-to-boost-trade-ties-10997104 before returning to China. Xi was invited to Panama by the Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela, who later said that \\"The Chinese president was impressed by Panama\\". Varela was criticized for inviting him, and for presumably ordering the closure of Corredor Sur, Balboa, and the Cinta Costera for three hours, even though Xi did not use the Corredor Sur highway. Xi presumably asked to be treated like Barack Obama was treated during his visit to Panama in 2015 and many consider Xi was treated even better than Obama. All of Xi's visits have been met with criticism from the general public. In Portugal, numerous companies have been bought by Chinese companies, with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa saying that \\"In Portugal, we are not anxious by the origin of foreign investment\\" and asked Europe to eschew \\"the path of protectionism\\" as EU countries agreed upon a framework regulating foreign investment, specially from China. Chinese residents have become the leading non-European applicants for Portugal's so-called ‚Äògolden visas‚Äô, whereby foreigners get residency in return for property investments of at least 500,000 euros.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinping-heads-to- portugal-as-chinas-influence-worries-eu-partners/articleshow/66930246.cms Xi spent 2 days per country. Xi left Panama on December 3 and over a dozen agreements between China and Panama were signed, and a feasibility study about the David‚ÄìPanama railway was received by Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela From Xi Jinping. China expects the railway to extend to all of Central America, connecting with the Mexican railway network. Panama has received from China the status of Most Favored Nation, which means that Panamanian ships get special treatment at Chinese ports. But some in Panama are concerned about the entry of Chinese companies onto the Panamanian ship registering business. Chinese tourists can only enter Panama in groups with a guide. In Panama there are two kinds of visa: Restringed visa and Stamped Visa. The Stamped visa is easier to get and Chinese tourists only require the latter, as formerly they required both visas. Xi Jinping said in the meeting with Varela that \\"The Chinese people (represented by the Chinese Communist Party) helped Panama become fully independent from the US in the 1960s (referring to Martyrs' Day (Panama)), and that China respects the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal.\\" Many agree that Xi said so in order to reassure Panamanians that the Chinese Communist Party has no intentions of colonizing Panama, but it was met with criticism, especially since China has not yet signed the Neutrality treaty of the Panama Canal (which has to be signed on the Organization of American States) and many consider the Chinese Communist Party wants to colonize Panama, given the speed its requests are fulfilled by the Panamanian government and the fact that virtually all public construction projects in Panama are being built by Chinese state-owned companies. Varela has said numerous times that all public tenders for construction projects are carried out transparently, even though it is rare for the public to know the details of public tenders. The tender for choosing the construction company for Panama's fourth bridge over the Panama Canal was awarded to China Communications Construction and China Harbour Engineering. Weeks before the end of the tender, these two companies ran ads on television, highlighting the Hong Kong‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau Bridge while it was still under construction, presumably to reassure the public that the bridge would be a well built one, since Panamanians are skeptical about Chinese product quality. The ads ran before the winner was announced. The day after Xi left Panama, on December 4, at 11 p.m., President Varela personally ordered the start of construction of the Fourth Bridge over the Panama Canal, highlighting again that it would be built by the same companies that built the Hong Kong‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau Bridge. He said that the construction companies were experts, since they had built a 55-km-long bridge and that he was confident about it. Varela also said at the China International Import Expo that his family could not miss the opportunity of doing business with China. (Since Varela's family owns a company that produces alcoholic beverages called Varela Hermanos). Television Station TVN made an investigation that revealed that China Communications Construction and China Harbour Engineering were under investigation in a Southeast Asian country (presumably Malaysia) over corruption charges related with Malaysia's former Prime Minister, Najib Razak, who is also under investigation over corruption charges related to Chinese investments in Malaysia, something about which Mahathir has been very critical. The Panama‚ÄìDavid railway will be built by China, having a maximum speed of 160 km/h (the original clan called for 300 km/h), with a length of over 400 km and a cost of over 5 billion dollars, 85% of which will be paid with a loan from a Chinese state-owned bank. It will be part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the New Silk Road. Panama's vice president Isabel Saint Malo showed confidence in the railway, saying that \\"I believe Panama has the ability to pay off its debt.\\" (Even though Panama has over US$20 billion in debt and presumably none of it has been paid in the last few years). Worries about the economic viability of the train are on the rise as similar projects built by China in other countries have economically failed, and have left the host countries in debt with China, with China offering to forgive the debt in exchange for free natural resources, or building military bases, usually for 99 years (as with Sri Lanka and Djibouti) or 35 years (as in Pakistan).

Three different engines were fitted, and one example flew the first non-stop Paris-Algiers flight in preparation for an abandoned trans- Atlantic attempt. Design and development Avim√©ta, (Soci√©t√© pour la Construction d'Avions M√©tallique)‚Äö grew out of the Aeronautical Department of the Schneider-Creusot arms manufacturer. The Avinm√©ta 92 was an all-metal aircraft, in accord with the company's principles. Its high, rectangular plan wing had constant thickness and was mounted without dihedral. It was built around two spars and its riveted skin, made of Schneider-Creusot's patented aluminium-iron alloy Alf√©rium, was corrugated in the line of flight for stiffness. Narrow chord ailerons filled the whole trailing edge. The wing was braced on each side with parallel pairs of streamlined struts from the lower fuselage to the wing spars at about mid-span. The Avim√©ta 92 was powered by a variety of nose-mounted radial engines from Wright, Salmson and Lorraine- Dietrich, with powers in the range . The Bristol Titan was also considered. The engine had a pair of fuel tanks in the wings and an oil tank aft of the engine firewall. Behind it the fuselage cross-section was rectangular and completely clear internally back to the tail. It was based on four longerons interconnected by frames and covered with Alf√©rium plates stiffened with longitudinal ribs. Seating was below the wing, with the enclosed cockpit set into the leading edge and a four-passenger cabin behind with two facing rows of side-by-side seats. There were passenger entry doors on both sides of the cabin and a separate, port-side door to the cockpit. The empennage was conventional and angular, constructed in the same way as the wing. The horizontal tail was almost rectangular in plan and was mounted on top of the fuselage, supported by inverted V-struts from below. The fin was triangular and carried a deep, rectangular rudder which ran down to the keel, operating in a small elevator cut-out. The Avim√©ta had conventional, fixed landing gear with a wide track. Each wheel was on a bent axle from the fuselage at the base of the forward wing strut, with a near-vertical leg fitted with a rubber shock absorber mounted on that same strut at a higher point which was reinforced with an inward-leaning strut to the upper fuselage and another rearwards to the base of the rear wing strut. The axles were stabilised with drag struts, again to the bottom of the rear wing strut. Aft, the tailskid was sprung steel. Operational history The Avim√©ta 92 was flown for the first time near the beginning of December 1927, piloted by Moutonnier and powered by an uncowled nine-cylinder, Salmson 9Ac radial. By mid-March 1928 one was flying with a Lorraine 7M Mizar seven cylinder radial. This had a higher gross weight of and a maximum speed of . Its development continued at least into May. The best known Avim√©ta 92 was powered by a Wright R-790 Whirlwind nine-cylinder radial and was modified for a proposed long distance flight, rumoured to be trans-Atlantic, to be flown by D√©troyat. The alterations included an increased span with curved, tapered tips and extra fuel tanks able to hold up to . Tests on fuel consumption and reliability included flights in mid-April from Paris to Algeria (the first such non-stop journey) and back. Despite the preparations, no further long distance flights by it were recorded in contemporary French journals. At least 2 of these aircraft were purchased by Belgian nobleman and diplomat Eug√®ne de Ligne to establish an air route between Belgium and the Congo. Both aircraft (registered as OO-AJY and OO-AJZ) were lost in early 1929 due to air crashes, the latter claiming the life of WWI fighter ace Edmond Thieffry and his co-pilot.

On the fourth day after the massacre, when a US Army detail went out to bury the dead, Zintk√°la was found on the battlefield under a covering of snow, still tied and protected on her frozen mother's back. The baby was first cared for by members of the Lakota and she fully recovered from four days' exposure to freezing temperatures without food. Without knowledge of her identity or Lakota birth name, she was called Zintkala Nuni (\\"Lost Bird\\"). Zintkala was removed by General Leonard Wright Colby who took her by train to his home in Beatrice, Nebraska. as a relic or \\"curio\\" of the massacre. He legally adopted her on January 19, 1891, naming her Margaret Elizabeth Colby. Colby said about his new daughter, \\"She is my relic of the Sioux War of 1891 and the Massacre of Wounded Knee.\\" Zintkala was raised by Colby's wife, Clara Bewick Colby, who was a suffragette activist and publisher of The Woman's Tribune newspaper. Learning that a Lakota woman had said \\"Zintkala nuni\\" [lost bird] when Colby took her away, Clara Colby called her \\"Zintka.\\" When Zintka was 5 years old, General Colby abandoned the family, married Zintka's nanny and moved to Beatrice, Nebraska. According to her biographer, because she was raised by a privileged, white family yet was sent to segregated boarding schools for her education, Zintkala suffered through a childhood of prejudice and rejection by both relatives and classmates. Due to Clara Colby's busy work life, Zintkala spent her school years at various Native American boarding schools including Haskell in Kansas and Chamberlain in South Dakota. When Zintkala was 17 years old, Clara Colby decided Zintkala was too rebellious and sent her to live with her adoptive father. Soon after, Zintkala became pregnant. Although the father of her child is unknown, historians suspect Zintkala was sexually abused by Colby. General Colby committed Zintkala to the Nebraska Industrial Home in Milford, Nebraska, a reformatory for unwed mothers, where her child was stillborn. Her father left her in the reformatory for a year. Zintkala returned to her adoptive mother who now lived in Portland, Oregon. Zintka soon married but contracted syphilis from her husband and left him after only a few weeks of marriage. Zintkala worked as a performer for Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show and as an extra in silent films. She portrayed Pocahontas at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. In 1918, suffering poverty, she and her third husband moved in with his parents in Hanford, California. On February 14 1920, Zintkala died of Spanish influenza complicated by syphilis. She was buried in a pauper's grave in Hanford. On July 11, 1991, a ceremony led by nineteenth- generation Keeper of the Sacred Calf Pipe of the Lakota Nation, Arvol Looking Horse, was held at Wounded Knee, South Dakota to inter the transferred remains of Zintkala Nuni near the mass grave of her Lakota family. In her honor, the Lost Bird Society was created to help those Native Americans who were adopted outside their culture to recover their heritage.

She moved from London to Cobham in Surrey in 1823 and immediately began a series of regular observations which continued until 1858 and in part until 1867. Each day she recorded data in 19 columns, including the date, hours of sunset and sunrise, several temperature readings, barometer pressure, observations on animals and on plants, and Tagliabue's storm glass reading.

It defended North East England during the Battle of Britain and The Blitz.  Mobilisation  The 7th Anti-Aircraft Division was created in 1939 by Anti-Aircraft Command to control the anti-aircraft (AA) defences of North East England, Yorkshire and Humberside. It took over brigades from the 2nd AA Division, which then concentrated on defending the North Midlands and East Midlands, and from the 3rd AA Division defending Scotland. Planned from February 1939 and established in June, the new division's exact responsibilities were still being worked out when war broke out. The Divisional headquarters (HQ) was established at Newcastle upon Tyne on 16 September and the first General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General T.G.G. Heywood, who had been Brigadier, Royal Artillery, in Aldershot Command.

Phoney War  However, equipment was critically short. In August 1939 the 7th AA Division only had the following:Routledge, p. 372. * 3-inch LAA guns: 14 * Bofors 40 mm and 2-pounder LAA guns: 22 * Light Machine Guns (LMGs ‚Äì mainly Lewis guns): 486 * S/Ls: 673 (In addition to the LAA LMGs, each S/L position had an LMG for self defence). Luckily, the months of the Phoney War that followed mobilisation allowed AA Command to address its equipment shortages. Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) with 3-inch or 3.7-inch HAA guns were established around Leeds, Teesside (including Middlesbrough and Billingham) and Tyneside (including Newcastle). Vital Points (VPs) such as RAF Fighter Command airfields and factories began to receive a few Bofors guns.Routledge, p. 373. AA Command was also desperate for manpower. When the War Office released the first intakes of Militiamen to the Command in early 1940, most were found to be in low physical categories and without training. The 31st AA Brigade reported that out of 1000 recruits sent for duty, '50 had to be discharged immediately because of serious medical defects, another 20 were judged to be mentally deficient and a further 18 were unfit to do any manual labour such as lifting ammunition'.Routledge, p. 374. Fitness and training was greatly improved by the time Britain's AA defences were seriously tested during the Battle of Britain and Blitz. In 1940, RA regiments equipped with 3-inch or 3.7-inch AA guns were designated Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) regiments, and RE AA battalions were transferred to the RA and designated Searchlight (S/L) regiments. After the German invasion of the Low Countries in May 1940, Maj-Gen Heywood was appointed head of the British Military Mission to the Netherlands and briefly replaced as GOC of the 7th AA Division by Maj-Gen J.E.T Younger, promoted from command of the 57th LAA Brigade. Within days, Younger was transferred to command the 3rd AA Division and later was replaced by Maj-Gen R.B. Pargiter from the 4th AA Division.Younger at Generals of World War II.Pargiter at Generals of World War II.  Battle of Britain  Tyneside, Wearside, and Teesside were important strategic targets because of their high concentrations of heavy industry and ports. During the early part of the Battle of Britain, German day and night air raids and mine laying began along the East Coast of England, intensifying through June 1940. Thereafter the Luftwaffe concentrated on Royal Air Force sites in the South of England, with occasional raids on the North East, such as the period 12‚Äì15 August.Routledge, Table LXII, pp. 379‚Äì80. On 15 August, in the belief that the defences of NE England had been denuded, Luftflotte 5 attacked across the North Sea from Norway. Some 65 Heinkel He 111 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 26 escorted by 35 Messerschmitt Bf 110 Zerst√∂rer fighters of Zerst√∂rergeschwader 76 were picked up on radar and ambushed by fighters of No. 13 Group RAF before they reached the coast. Those bombers that succeeded in breaking through then split into two groups, one being engaged by the guns of the Tyne GDA the other by the Tees GDA. Bombs were widely scattered and only at Sunderland was any major damage inflicted. KG 26 lost 8 bombers and 7 fighters for no loss to the RAF, in 'one of the most successful air actions of the war'.Basil Collier pp. 191‚Äì4, Map 16.Richard Collier, Eagle Day, pp. 86‚Äì8. On 21 August, the 7th AA Division had its guns distributed as follows:Basil Collier, Appendix XXII. * Leeds: 20 HAA * Teesside: 30 HAA * Tyneside: 50 HAA * Airfields of No. 13 Group RAF and other VPs: 14 HAA, 62 LAA, 270 LMG * Mobile: 4 HAA * S/L: 604 With the bulk of the fighting occurring further south, the mobile guns soon moved out of the division's area. In September 1940 the 7th AA Division formed the 7th AA Z Regiment equipped with rocket projectors.7 Z Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45.  The Blitz  The Battle of Britain was followed by the Luftwaffe 's night Blitz on London and other industrial cities during the winter of 1940‚Äì41. Again, NE England escaped the worst of this, but hundreds of people died during the Newcastle Blitz and there were notable air raids on Tyneside on 9 April and Sunderland on 25 April.Basil Collier, Appendices XXX and XXXI.Routledge, pp. 387‚Äì404. AA Command was now reaching its peak strength, and there was considerable reorganisation in November 1940. The 31st and 39th AA Brigades transferred to a new 10th AA Division covering Yorkshire and Humberside, and the 7th AA Division came under the command of III Anti-Aircraft Corps. The 30th AA Brigade was covering Tyneside and the 43rd AA Brigade covering Teesside, while the 57th LAA Brigade had become primarily a searchlight rather than LAA gun formation.Routledge, p. 393, Maps 34 & 35. = Order of Battle 1940‚Äì41 = The 3rd AA Division had the following composition during the Blitz:7 AA Division 1940 at RA 1939‚Äì45.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 397.Farndale, Annex D, pp. 257‚Äì9.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79. 30th AA Brigade * 63rd (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt ‚Äì see above * 64th (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt ‚Äì see above * 37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) LAA Rgt ‚Äì duplicate of the 37th (TEE) S/L Rgt, see above * 38th LAA Rgt (part) ‚Äì unit shared with the 10th AA Division * 68rd LAA Rgt‚Äì new unit raised in December 1940Farndale, Annex M. * 7th AA Z Rgt ‚Äì see above 43rd AA Brigade * 8th (Belfast) HAA Rgt ‚Äì returned from Dunkirk and re-equippedFarndale, p. 98. * 73rd HAA Rgt ‚Äì returned from Dunkirk and re-equipped * 50th LAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit raised in July 1940 * 72nd LAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit raised in January 1941 * 47th (Durham Light Infantry) S/L Rgt ‚Äì see above * 55th (Durham Light Infantry) S/L Rgt ‚Äì see above 57th AA Brigade * 41st LAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit raised in January 1941 * 46th (Lincolnshire Regiment) S/L Rgt ‚Äì see above * 53rd (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) S/L Rgt ‚Äì see above * 7th AA Divisional Signals, RCS * 7th AA Divisional RASC  907th and 923rd Companies * 7th AA Divisional Company, Royal Army Medical Corps * 7th AA Divisional Workshop Company, RAOC In 1941, the 7th Divisional Signals became a 'Mixed' unit, indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into the unit.  Mid-War  The main Blitz ended in May 1941, but occasional raids continued. Newly-formed AA units joined the division, the HAA and support units increasingly being 'mixed'. At the same time, experienced units were posted away for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) and the need to transfer AA units to counter the Baedeker Blitz and the Luftwaffe's hit- and-run attacks against South Coast towns.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì404. In August 1942, the 3rd AA Division was sent to the South Coast and the 7th AA Division took over command of the 36th (Scottish) AA Brigade covering Edinburgh and the Forth.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.

Plot The 59-year-old widower Josef has to cope with the death of his wife and son. After his son died in a bus accident, his wife had no more life courage and soon also died. During his visits to the cemetery, he meets Nina, who introduces herself as alleged cousin of his wife. She tells him that her son Simon and his wife Milena are looking for a place to live and that they can not find it, and gets Joseph to offer them a temporary home in his spacious villa on the outskirts of town. Soon after, the couple will follow Nina herself and her partner Konstantin and Milena's son Marco. They all spread out in the spacious property. First of all, Josef is happy about the visitors who care for him and bring him back a bit of life's courage. With time, however, there are more and more tensions between him and his new roommates and the originally ideal world begins to crumble. In particular, Simon is a thorn in Joseph's eye with his questionable educational methods, which he shows when dealing with Milena's son Marco. Even Konstantin attracts Joseph's displeasure - he has settled in his office and operates a shady business, and invites alleged clients to the property to have grand celebrations. In the course of the entanglements Simon and Nina come to their deaths. Konstantin, who is largely responsible for it, is killed by Josef in the forest at night when he is about to bury Nina's body. Then Josef returns to the villa in the early morning, where Milena, who has become his mistress, is already waiting for him. Josef has found a new family with Milena and her son Marco and in the hope of a carefree future, they will live together on his estate from now on.

Its main distinguishing characteristic is the amyloid reaction of the skeletal hyphae, although some authors do not consider this to be sufficient to distinguish Amyloporia from the related genus Antrodia. Taxonomy The genus was originally circumscribed by Apollinaris Semenovich Bondartsev and Rolf Singer in 1941 as part of the subfamily Poroideae of the family Polyporaceae. Four species were included: the type Antrodia calcea, A. crassa, A. xantha, and A. lenis. These mycologists later independently published the genus with a Latin description (establishing the validity of the publication in accordance with rules of nomenclature): Singer in 1944, and Bondartsev in 1953. There has historically been much confusion about the true identity of A. calcea. It is now classified in the genus Antrodia (family Fomitopsidaceae) as Antrodia calceus. Some authors have preferred to treat Amyloporia as synonymous with Antrodia. A molecular study published in 2010 determined that the five species then considered part of Amyloporia did not group together phylogenetically, and that Amyloporia was not worthy of generic status. The generic name Amyloporia combines the Ancient Greek word (\\"starch\\") and the name Poria. Description Bondartsev and Singer, in their description of Amyloporia, emphasized the pore colour‚Äìinitially white or colored, eventually becoming whiteish or often yellowish to slightly brownish; and amyloid trama in the adult fruit body. These features helped distinguish Amyloporia from the morphologically similar Ceraporus and Aporpium. Species , Index Fungorum accepts five species in Amyloporia: *A. nothofaginea Rajchenb. & Gorj√≥n (2011) ‚Äì southern Andes *A. sinuosa (Fr.)

History Teacher's Camp in 1909 It was established on December 11, 1908 by an ordinance by Benguet Governor William Pack in an area which was then named O-ring-ao to accommodate both American and Filipino teachers. The outline of the camp's plan was made by W. Morgan Schuster, secretary of the Bureau of Public Instruction on January 18, 1908. The camp opened as a training center and vacation site for teachers and employees of the Insular government a few months later on April 6, 1908. The first Teachers Vacation Assembly took place from April 6 to May 30, 1908. During its early years, tents were used for the camp's classrooms, kitchen, dining and storage facilities. In 1911, the first building was built in Teacher's Camp. Access roads and pathways were made. In 1912, cottages were set up for the camp director, secretary and undersecretary of education. More funds were allocated for Teacher's Camp's development which led to the Benitez Hall, Ladies Hall, Teacher's Hall, Tavera Hall, and the White Hall being built. The Philippine Military Academy (PMA) previously occupied a large area of Teacher's Camp before World War II from 1936. The PMA temporarily moved out of Camp Henry Allen to Teacher's Camp on due to a projected increase in the number of members of the Cadet Corps. During the PMA occupancy the General Luna Hall was built. The PMA stayed in Teacher's Camp from June 15, 1936 until December 12, 1941, when the world war broke out. After the war the academy moved backed to Camp Allen in 1947. It transferred to Fort Gregorio del Pilar in 1950. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines from 1942 to 1945, the occupying forces use the camp as their hospital. It was left damaged after the war but was repaired and reopened in 1947. The first Philippine Sports Summit was held in the early 1990s during the presidency of Fidel V. Ramos where the Magna Carta for Philippine Sports was made as an effort to boost the national sports program. Such efforts failed when the original Magna Carta was not referred to in the succeeding summits. Usage Athletic track in Teacher's Camp Teacher's Camp served as a training center for teachers from various parts of the Philippines. Teachers enroll in education special courses during the summer break. The center hosts classrooms, dormitories, cottages, dining areas, assembly halls and administrative offices. When teachers are not using the facility, the dormitories and cottages are rented to tourists. It also hosts events sponsored by government agencies. It also has an athletic oval where national athletes of the country who compete in the Olympics trains. From 1976 to 1989, track and field athletes under the government initiated, Gintong Alay sports program trained at Teacher's Camp. Heritage status National Historical Institute marker On May 12, 2008, Teacher's Camp was reportedly declared as national heritage site. The facility is a marked structure according to a 2015 report. Believers of the paranormal say the camp is haunted because it is claimed to be more than 100 years old.

The American Section was formed on January 18, 1918, and held its first meeting on April 4, 1918. The Soci√©t√© de Chimie Industrielle (American Section) hosts speakers, grants scholarships, and gives awards. It has given the International Palladium Medal roughly every second year since 1961, and helps to award the Othmer Gold Medal and the Winthrop-Sears Medal every year. The Soci√©t√© also hosts monthly talks, and presents scholarships to writers, educators, and historians of science. History One of the first societies for chemists was the Society of Chemical Industry, founded in London in 1881. This inspired a number of other groups, including the Soci√©t√© de Chimie Industrielle in Paris, France. The French Soci√©t√© was modeled on the British organization in 1917. A number of those active in forming the French Soci√©t√© were elected to its first set of officers, which included industrialist Paul Kestner as president, vice-presidents Albin Haller and Henry Louis Le Ch√¢telier, and Jean G√©rard as general secretary. Creation of the French Soci√©t√© in turn inspired creation of a related American association in New York in 1918. This was part of an effort to rebuild international connections between individuals and institutions that had been disrupted during the First World War. Ren√© Laurent Engel encouraged the re-establishment of ties between chemists in the two countries in his position as the scientific representative in a French Mission to the United States. Victor Grignard of the University of Nancy also encouraged the creation of an American organization. A circular appealed to the Chemists and Manufacturers of America to \\"extend to our French fellow chemists and manufacturers our moral and financial support and the right hand of good fellowship.\\" The American section of the Soci√©t√© de Chimie Industrielle was formed on January 18, 1918, following the presentation of the Perkin Medal by the Society of Chemical Industry (American Section) at The Chemists' Club in New York. Engel, as secretary of the parent organization, addressed the meeting. Officers of the newly created American section of the Soci√©t√© de Chimie Industrielle included Leo Baekeland as president, Jerome Alexander as vice-president, Charles Avery Doremus as secretary, and George Frederick Kunz as treasurer. A report describes the Soci√©t√©'s purpose as follows: The first official meeting of the American section of the Soci√©t√© de Chimie Industrielle was held on April 4, 1918 at The Chemists' Club in New York. William H. Nichols, president of the American Chemical Society, welcomed the new organization. Frederick J. LeMaistre reported on \\"Conditions in the French chemical industries during 1916\\". Governance The Soci√©t√© de Chimie Industrielle (American Section) is now an independent organization. It was granted tax status as a 501(c)(3), a registered nonprofit organization as of 1952.

History The Ottawa County Road Commission undertook a county-wide road and bridge improvement project, starting in the 1910s. In 1921, the commission hired Carl Bowen, a former civil engineer at the Michigan State Highway Department. Bowen supervised the construction of numerous projects during his 30+ year tenure with the commission, including the construction of this bridge in 1948. The design of the bridge was completed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1947, and L.W. Lamb of Holland was contracted to construct the bridge. Construction started in February 1948, and the bridge was opened to traffic in December. The bridge was dedicated to Carl Bowen at the request of the local Chamber of Commerce. It has continued to carry traffic since its construction. (note: large pdf file) The superstructure was reconstructed, and the bridge repaved, in 2008. Description The Fruitport Road‚ÄìPettys Bayou Bridge is a multiple- span concrete-and-steel bridge, consisting of nine spans stretching 418 feet. Five spans are 55 feet in length, two are 53 feet, and two are 18 feet. Each span contains eight lines of rolled I-beams, braced laterally. The foundations of the bridge are unusually deep, due to the marshy soil below and the substructure units are of a lightweight cellular construction to reduce the load on the soil, and spread it out over a large area. The superstructure is of standard Michigan State Highway Department design, with corbeled steps on the bulkheads and concrete piers, ornamental steel guardrails, and a concrete deck.

At a time when society is facing unprecedented technological disruption in all walks of life, Canadians have a greater need than ever for personalized financial planning advice with a human touch. FP Canada provides the financial planning profession with the leadership it needs to help Canadians achieve financial well-being in this new digital era. At a high level, FP Canada sets the strategic direction for professional financial planning in Canada. FP Canada also achieves its mandate through two distinct divisions. Through the FP Canada Standards Council‚Ñ¢ division, FP Canada establishes financial planning standards and enforces those standards among FP Canada certificants ‚Äì Certified Financial Planner¬Æ professionals and FPSC Level 1¬Æ certificants in Financial Planning (effective January 1, 2020, the Qualified Associate Financial Planner‚Ñ¢ designation‚ÄîQAFP‚Ñ¢ certification‚Äîwill replace FPSC Level 1 certification). Through the FP Canada Institute‚Ñ¢ division, which is dedicated to elevating the practice of financial planning, FP Canada provides professional education, tools and resources to help financial planners meet the needs of all Canadians. FP Canada operates in all provinces except Qu√©bec; however, through a strategic partnership with Institut qu√©b√©cois de planification financi√®re, the only body in Qu√©bec authorized to confer financial planning diplomas, FP Canada‚Äôs standards are adopted nationally. There are approximately 23,000 professional financial planners in Canada who, through FPSC Level 1 certification, CFP certification and the Pl. Fin. license in Qu√©bec, meet FP Canada‚Äôs standards. FP Canada is continually working toward the formal professionalization of financial planning. In most Canadian provinces there is no legislated standard in place for the estimated 100,000 people who claim to offer financial advice. With the exception of Qu√©bec, people who call themselves financial planners are not required to obtain any credentials whatsoever. FP Canada believes that everyone who claims to be a financial planner should be required to meet stringent proficiency and ethics requirements, including high levels of education and experience. These rigorous requirements are met by all FP Canada certificants. Recognition of financial planning as a distinct profession within the financial services and advice landscape will reduce consumer confusion regarding their choice of financial advisor and will safeguard and enhance the financial well-being of Canadians and ultimately lead to the betterment of the financial planning profession. FP Canada Institute‚Ñ¢ A division of FP Canada‚Ñ¢, the FP Canada Institute‚Ñ¢ is dedicated to elevating the practice of financial planning. The FP Canada Institute provides professional education, practice support tools and other resources to financial planners and financial planning students to help them meet the needs and expectations of all Canadians seeking financial planning advice from a certified professional. The FP Canada Institute currently offers three e-learning programs: the QAFP Professional Education Program‚Ñ¢, the CFP Professional Education Program‚Ñ¢ and Introduction to Professional Ethics‚Ñ¢ (IPE). These e-learning programs help prospective and existing financial planners apply their technical knowledge, learn key facets of human behaviour that affect the planning engagement and decision-making, and develop essential professional skills in the areas of communications, critical thinking and ethics. These programs complement the Core Curriculum and Advanced Curriculum Programs offered by colleges, universities and third-party educators on the paths to certification. In the years ahead, the FP Canada Institute will be adding more education programs and developing tools and other resources to enrich financial planners‚Äô knowledge and skills and equip them with the tools to serve clients as effectively as possible. Read the FAQ: FP Canada & New Certification FP Canada Standards Council‚Ñ¢ A division of FP Canada‚Ñ¢;, the FP Canada Standards Council‚Ñ¢ establishes and enforces financial planning standards, sets the certification requirements for professional financial planners and develops and delivers certification examinations. The FP Canada Standards Council ensures FP Canada certificants ‚Äï Certified Financial Planner¬Æ professionals and FPSC Level 1¬Æ certificants in Financial Planning ‚Äï meet appropriate standards of competence and professionalism through rigorous requirements of education, examination, experience and ethics. The Standards of Professional Responsibility for CFP¬Æ Professionals and FPSC Level 1 Certificants in Financial Planning, set and enforced by the FP Canada Standards Council, define the ethical and professional responsibilities of FP Canada certificants. By ensuring adherence to these standards, the Standards Council protects both the Canadian public and the reputation of the financial planning profession. The Standards Council thoroughly investigates all allegations of misconduct with respect to FP Canada certificants and exercises disciplinary action when appropriate.

The Foundation‚Äôs mission is to fund, promote and disseminate financial planning research for the benefit of Canadians. As the financial planning profession continues to evolve and clients‚Äô needs become increasingly complex, planners need practical techniques founded on solid, quantifiable research that can help them stay ahead of the curve. The FP Canada Research Foundation is committed to providing this type of ground- breaking research. Its focus includes technical research that tests financial planning strategies and challenges existing models to ensure Canadians are getting the best advice to suit their unique circumstances. In addition, the Foundation facilitates important research into behavioural considerations and the impact of financial planning on society.

It was released on 12 June 2017 through Dirty Hit as the album's lead single. Background and release On May 2017, the band started teasing their return by sending fans on their mailing list cryptic postcards with lyrics and song titles, including \\"Yuk Foo\\", which they later posted themselves on their Twitter account. A few days later, posters for \\"Yuk Foo\\" with a 12 June release date were spotted by fans in London. The band has later confirmed that it was their new single and that it would be premiered by Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1 on that date. After its premiere, the song was released to streaming services and digital retailers. The band had performed the song previously on 8 April 2016 in Columbus, Ohio as part of their US tour in support of their debut album, My Love Is Cool. Fan-shot videos of the performance were uploaded to YouTube before being removed for copyrights violation. In an interview with The Fader, Rowsell stated: \\"I was on tour, and I'd been on tour for about one thousand years at that point. I was in Columbus, Ohio or somewhere. I wrote it really quickly, and I didn't refine it. It was this outpour of emotion. I was in my dressing room ‚Äî we were playing on this radio show, and there were lots of bands [in surrounding rooms]. I didn't want anyone to hear me shouting, so I was shouting like a mouse into the microphone. Foals were in the dressing room next to me, and I was thinking, I wonder if they can hear me screaming \\"I wanna fuck all the people I meet\\"? I must have had so much rage inside me, and it just came out. I'd just read that book, Our Band Could Be Your Life, about American hardcore, and I really wanted to make a three-minute, angry song. A lot of it is about expectations of me ‚Äî as someone's girlfriend, as someone's friend, as someone in a band, as someone with a platform, as a woman. [...] Normally I would cross out the line [\\"I wanna fuck all the people I meet\\"]; I would have kept that to myself. But the performance and the lyrics and how abrasive they are ‚Äî that was my point. I wasn't swearing because I think it's cool, or because I couldn't think of anything to say. I was doing it because that's what you do when you're angry, you curse and scream. People are going to be like, \\"What do you mean, you want to fuck all your friends?\\" But it's like, you don't [say to] a director of a movie, \\"It's so awkward that you wrote a film about murdering prostitutes.\\" It's made up!\\" Critical reception NME writer Jamie Milton said the song is \\"an enraged, viciously snarling return, so fury-filled it's capable of leaving you physically shaken,\\" while praising Rowsell's delivery, saying: \\"Across just two minutes, she howls, grunts and cackles between words. The last thing you hear is a piercing wail, like she's screaming directly into a loudspeaker placed next to your ear. 'Yuk Foo' packs rage and angst like sardines in a box, crushed together into a bullet-shaped attack. It's the sound of Wolf Alice making a serious step up.\\" Similarly, Dork magazine stated that \\"Ellie Rowsell is growling, screaming even, her voice straining at the edges as it rips itself apart ‚Äì equal parts unrelenting attitude and red hot fury. The spite is as good as another instrument as she calls out the world in increasingly vicious terms,\\" saying that the song is \\"the all the sass of a militant wing of the Spice Girls inducted into a Nine Inch Nails inspired death cult. Its eyes are set firm, its grin unnervingly fixed. It's absolutely fucking glorious.\\" Clash said the song is \\"the most willfully non-commercial, daring, addictive, and downright genius comeback single from a band we've heard in some time.\\" DIY praised the band, saying the song is \\"piercing, prescient and precocious as fuck - in its short length 'Yuk Foo' encapsulates pretty much everything that's great about Wolf Alice, and maybe even music itself. The best band of the decade just - incredulously - stepped it up. Under the Radar and The Guardian both awarded it as the best track of the week, with the latter publication saying: \\"Wolf Alice have spat out the most amusingly petulant hate song since Ugly Kid Joe. \\"Yuk Foo\\" is a thrilling, two-minute surge of self-indulgent punk fury that's swearier than a Tory aide on election night.\\" Music video The song's accompanying music video was released on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube on 27 July 2017. The video was filmed in a day in Shoreditch Town Hall by Adam Powell. The video has been described by DIY as \\"as dark and dingy as the track itself.\\" In an interview with Dazed, lead vocalist Ellie Rowsell said \\"because the song's so fast, heavy and brash, it doesn't really seem to lend itself to a narrative video. One of the reasons we took \\"Yuk Foo\\" to the studio ‚Äì besides liking it as a song in and of itself ‚Äì was because we were so excited to play it live. It's got so much energy, and so we wanted to make a live video to match; short, and manically fast-paced.\\" References External links * 2017 singles 2017 songs Dirty Hit singles Wolf Alice songs Songs written by Ellie Rowsell Music videos directed by Adam Powell ","title":"Yuk Foo"},{"id":"54294325","text":"Kevin Hervey (born July 9, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for Lokomotiv Kuban of the VTB United League and the EuroCup.

He is also known for his production designs for films, including the 1991 film Beethoven Lives Upstairs.  Biography  Porteous initially started acting in high school, but was more attracted to scenic and costume design; he completed a degree at the Banff School of Fine Arts and began working in design for television. Seeking more training for theatrical design, Porteous studied at the Wimbledon College of Arts in London before returning to Canada in 1969. As a student in London, he was exposed to the work of European and British designers such as Richard Negri, Tanya Moiseiwitsch, Joseph Svoboda, and Sean Kenny, and Continental trends became an important influence on his work. He began a long collaboration with the director Christopher Newton as head of design at the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company in 1972. At the Shaw Festival, Newton and Porteous championed total design, achieving unity by assigning set and costume designs to the same designer. For the Shaw's ambitious production of No√´l Coward's Cavalcade, the North American premiere of the play, Porteous used a hydraulic turntable to transport actors, props and the elaborate set pieces on- and offstage within seconds, and projections to suggest a variety of settings and time periods. Porteous has also designed for Tarragon Theatre, the National Arts Centre, the Citadel Theatre, Young People's Theatre, and the Vancouver Opera.

The book was coauthored by The Learning Annex entrepreneur Bill Zanker. Another edition was subsequently published in paperback in 2008 under the title Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life. Trump and Zanker had prior business ventures together before writing the book; Zanker's company helped gain Trump speaking engagements around the world with large audiences. The book advises the reader to create large goals for oneself, citing his future political opponent Hillary Clinton as an example of success. Trump focuses a chapter \\"Revenge\\" on the importance of retribution, recounting his feud with Rosie O'Donnell and criticism of Mark Cuban. The book describes Trump's romantic exploits, and he muses that an unknown quality gave him success with women. Coauthor Zanker describes Trump's history with The Learning Annex, saying his business partner gave a significant amount of earnings to charity. Trump discusses his debt difficulties with banks in the 1990s, and criticizes the banks for unwisely investing with him. Trump promoted the book on Larry King Live, at a cash giveaway in New York City, and in a speech at the Wharton School. The book's 2007 printing was for 400,000 copies. Becoming a bestseller in 2007, the book was the highest selling personal finance work on Amazon.com in 2015. Vanguard wrote positively of the book, and fashion designer Emilia Wickstead said it inspired her to become an entrepreneur. Real Estate Weekly called the book \\"the icon of everything Trump\\". London Review of Books wrote that it capitalized on consumers' dreams. The work was negatively received by two reviews in The Economist, and by Real-World Economics Review, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Background Donald Trump coauthored Think Big and Kick Ass with The Learning Annex entrepreneur Bill Zanker. Prior to coauthoring the book, Trump and Zanker had entered into a business relationship through The Learning Annex. Zanker's company performed marketing services for the Trump Organization and Trump's brand. The Learning Annex helped arrange speeches around the world for Trump. The speeches by Trump were billed as part of a series called the Learning Annex Wealth Expos. Zanker's efforts helped garner crowds of 80,000 in attendance at some of Trump's speeches. After their collaborations including The Learning Annex and Think Big and Kick Ass, Trump and Zanker cofounded a crowdfunding website called FundAnything in 2013. Trump's role included placing monies into the company, investing in donation drives, and marketing his donations via Twitter. Trump parted with FundAnything in December 2014. Trump said of his business ventures with coauthor Zanker, \\"We really have had great success together.\\" Summary Donald Trump in 2008 Think Big and Kick Ass emphasizes the importance of maintaining large goals for oneself. Trump elaborates on his think big thesis, saying bravado and playing to people‚Äôs fantasies can excite people who do not think big themselves. He advises budding business careerists to have an optimistic outlook, crediting his positive attitude for his success. Because those who seek out their passions in life will find financial success, he tells readers to devote two hours a day focusing on how to generate money. The book talks about the importance of concentration on the task at hand, but cautions against narrow-mindedness and inflexibility. Trump describes his expectations of loyalty from his employees, writing, \\"I try to hire people who are honest and loyal. ... I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well. I go out of my way for the people who were loyal to me in bad times.\\" Trump cites Hillary Clinton as an example of an individual with \\"the ability to think big\\". He warns about repercussions for disloyalty, saying a lack of respect will lead to struggles. The chapter \\"Revenge\\" focuses on achieving retribution against perceived enemies. It begins by recounting a long-running argument between Trump and actress Rosie O'Donnell. Trump then criticizes businessman Mark Cuban's television persona and appearance. He goes on to praise Bill Clinton's courage and criticizes Mario Cuomo's lack of it. Trump advises readers who have been wronged to \\"screw them back in spades\\" and reap any possible benefits. He elaborated on the measure of revenge by saying he responds to wrongs by retaliating in the same manner, but with more severity. Trump cautions readers against being complacent and trusting in civilization because the world is cruel and ruthless. Trump writes that those who do not seek revenge are remiss and calls them \\"schmucks\\". Trump recalls some of his romantic exploits, claiming to have secretly been with \\"Beautiful, famous, successful, married\\" women. Trump reflects on how he would be filled with disbelief during these exploits, surprised at his own success. He explained that he was successful in his endeavors with women due to some unknown quality he possessed. Coauthor Bill Zanker writes in the work about the importance of brand name power for Trump, saying Trump's worth comes from his passion and ability to connect with people. Zanker gave his company, The Learning Annex and its business relationship with Trump as an example, saying Trump earns more from speaking engagements than just the nominal amount on his paycheck when one factors in advertising and promotion. Trump concurs with Zanker's assessment and notes that he donates his monetary income from speeches to charity. Trump discusses his 1990s conflicts with finance companies regarding debt management in the work, saying the banks accepted some of the blame. He tells the reader that economic depressions are beyond a borrower's control and reminds them that banks fear lawsuits. Genre The New Yorker and Politico placed Think Big and Kick Ass in the genre of self-help books. The Economist and Bookseller + Publisher Magazine said it was part of a trend of business books. The Economicst noted that during successful periods of the stock market more finance books were published. Author and academic John Lubans wrote about the business genre, \\"And there‚Äôs a subset of the business fad industry: books. Not about a system of work, but titles written by celebrity leaders like Donald Trump, Jack Welch, and others bent on explaining how they got to be as good as they decidedly are and how you too, if you follow their advice, can make it to the top. Mr. Trump‚Äôs latest, Think Big and Kick Ass, probably defines the genre.\\" Jeffrey L. Buller wrote in Change Leadership in Higher Education that the book was part of \\"a school of thought that says when it comes to success in life or at work, leadership requires people to become aggressive, assertive, and at times even abusive in order to achieve their goals. The Daily Beast marveled that subsequent to Trump's inauguration, the work joined the pantheon of presidential memoirs. Release and sales Think Big and Kick Ass was first published in 2007 in hardcover format by HarperCollins. An audiobook was released the same year. An audiobook was released under the same title again in 2008. The work was first published under the title Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life in paperback format in 2008. HarperCollins gave it additional print releases under this title, in 2010 and 2012. In November 2007 there were 400,000 print copies of the work. Must Read Summaries published a summary of the book in 2014 and 2016. Trump marketed the work with an interview on the CNN program Larry King Live, and at appearances in New York City. He promoted sales of the book by doling our currency. At an event in New York City, Trump personally handed out one-hundred-dollar bills to the first 100 purchasers of the book. Trump gave a presentation about the book at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in an event hosted by MSNBC on January 2, 2008. During a 2008 lawsuit involving Deutsche Bank, attorneys for the finance company quoted from the book as evidence about Trump's views on loan relationships with banks. According to The Economist, the book became a bestseller in 2007. In July 2015, the book was the highest selling work in the category of personal finance on Amazon.com. Trump declared revenues of less than $201.00 from the book in 2016. Critical reception Vanguard journalist Ochereome Nnanna wrote positively of the book in 2016, saying her impression of Trump was as \\"a very imaginative, straightforward, practical person\\". Fashion designer Emilia Wickstead told the Financial Times in 2014 that the book inspired her to become an entrepreneur in her twenties. Real Estate Weekly wrote in 2015, \\"Think Big And Kick Ass is the title of one of Trump's books and the icon of everything Trump.\\" London Review of Books said the work was a way to capitalize on the aspirations of consumers in 2016. In 2015, The Washington Free Beacon rated the cover art as the second best among Trump's books and said the book exemplified \\"The Trumpean Ideal\\". The Economist had two reviews of the book in 2007. One was critical of the advice imparted in the work, and the other wrote, \\"Donald Trump is a Wharton alumni, but you would not guess it from his new bestseller [...] with its street- fighter's advice to always get even and never marry without a prenuptial agreement.\\" University of Hawaii business history professor Robert R. Locke compared Trump's principals for self-enrichment to robber barons in the Gilded Age in a 2017 article on Trumponomics for Real-World Economics Review. In 2015, Carlos Lozada wrote in The Washington Post that he found most of Trump's advice to be obvious or useless. San Francisco Chronicle was critical of the book in 2016, calling it \\"self-aggrandizing\\" and, \\"extolling little other than a brash, Gordon Gekko-like pursuit of money and real estate holdings.\\" The Economic Times commented upon the work in 2017, saying it gave a window into Trump's views on deal-making. Bloomberg News and The Huffington Post observed in 2016 that the work formed part of a collection of works which were profitable for Trump in collaboration with ghostwriters.

Radio C√°rdenas was only nine years old when he began working on the radio program Peques Unic, on Radio Juventud. At 16, he began to broadcast football matches for Antena 3 Radio. He also collaborated on the show Ar√∫s con leche, directed by his brother-in-law Alfonso Ar√∫s. From 1990 to 1995 he broadcast football matches, both on Radio Club 25 and M80 Radio (on Cadena SER). In 1997, he directed and presented Segundos Fuera on Radio Espa√±a. There were a multitude of radio sketches, with the voices of the main characters of this country. Something similar would later on the program On the attack, Onda Rambla, where he made an acid review, and humor, on the most important news of the week. Since 2006, he has directed and presented the program Atr√©vete, in Cadena Dial, together with MJ Aled√≥n, Isidro Montalvo, Roberto Alcaraz, Luis Roll√°n and others. According to the General Media Study (EGM), the Atr√©vete program was the second fastest growing morning show in Spain. In 2008, he was awarded the Ondas Award for radio innovation for combining information, humor and entertainment, organizing a cruise during which a live radio was held over the weekend, with musical performances and competitions, with live participation from the listeners, and the coexistence of communicators and artists with the audience. On March 7, 8, and 9, 2008, it created a precedent in the history of Spanish radio by giving all its listeners a cruise to the Principality of Monaco through the program Atr√©vete de Cadena Dial. Artists as important as Sergio Dalma, Conchita, Carlos Baute, Merche and Andy and Lucas joined the cruise. In November 2009, Javier C√°rdenas wa once again a pioneer with the Cruise of the Daredoes, taking 2,000 boat listeners to Nice over a weekend with artists such as Chenoa, Manuel Carrasco and Efecto Mariposa. Throughout 2009, the program directed and presented by Javier C√°rdenas Atr√©vete was the only one that grew in all the general EGM media studies among the more than 15,000 programs that exist in Spain. The morning radio program Atr√©vete, directed and presented by Javier C√°rdenas, achieved a record audience in Cadena DIAL in 2009, reaching 960,000 daily listeners, a figure never achieved in the history of the radio network by such renowned professionals like Javier Sard√°, Andreu Buenafuente or Alfonso Ar√∫s. On July 15, 2010, was his last appearance on the \\"Atr√©vete\\" program of Cadena Dial, coinciding with the end of the season of the program, leaving it with another historical record when placing it, according to the second wave of the EGM 2010, with more than 1,070,000 daily listeners, something not previously achieved by anyone except the Top 40. In 2015, he was awarded the \\"Antena de Oro\\" award for the best radio presenter in the whole of Spain, achievement achieved by having done a remarkable and exceptional work.

According to the last EGM of the year 2010, Lev√°ntate y C√°rdenas becomes the morning program of the music radios with more growth, increasing a 25% audience, reaching 594,000 listeners a day. But that audience rise was only a harbinger of what would come next. In just a year and a half, the morning of Europe FM is among the most powerful in the country, from the 486 thousand inherited to haunt the million listeners as in its dial chain stage, being the program that grew the most in the Spanish musical radio, as he did in his day in Cadena Dial where they have never repeated the figures that Cardenas left when he left. In the third EGM 2012 \\"Rise and Cardenas\\" exceeded one million listeners, becoming the program that grew most in the Spanish music radio. Like the weekends where he exceeded 400,000 listeners. During the last 6 consecutive years \\" Lev√°ntate y C√°rdenas\\"It has been the radio program with the most increase in radio listeners, with which they have been proclaimed at present, as the absolute leader with the highest Share in all of Spain. Currently it is estimated that the number of listeners for the program \\"Lev√°ntate y C√°rdenas\\" during the weekend is around two million. Television He started in the world of television also with his brother-in-law Alfonso Ar√∫s in the For√ßa Bar√ßa program, which was broadcast in 1989 on TVE2. In the 1992 - 1993 season he followed Ar√∫s in his passage through Antena 3, and became a reporter of the humor program Al ataque. His peculiar interviews, especially to a clairvoyant named Carlos Jesus, who claimed to be the reincarnation of another person and have a parallel existence on another planet, reached great public repercussion and C√°rdenas went on to become one of the most famous personalities in the world. television with characters like the lighter boy and Tristanbraker, the ghost hunter. It is thanks to this new way of doing journalism, what C√°rdenas is worth to be a point of reference in programs like Sal y pimienta and No estamos locos between 1994 and 1997 in the regional channels and that same year he returns to TVE to drive, along with Alonso Caparr√≥s and Asunci√≥n Embodies the program Videos de Primera becoming the most watched program of the summer on national television. C√°rdenas uses a caustic and ironic tone with his interviewees, with which he tries to expose the eccentricities of the character in question. This would be the style that would mark part of his later career, his boastful epithet, helped him to achieve not only good radio rankings and his own prestige, but also embarrassing and embarrassing moments for his guests. After collaborating in La Parodia Nacional (1996 and 1997) and receiving different awards for the best television program on Antena 3 together with Constantino Romero, in 1997 he presented first-rate videos, being one of the most watched during the summer.

In this way, he makes famous figures such as Carmen de Mairena, El Poz√≠ or La Pantoja de Puerto Rico. In 2005 he was tried in Arona for lack of dignity of a disabled person interviewed. The appeal to the case was not made wait and through the resolution on the 19th of January 2010 absolution of the case is given to all involved, because before the interview, the aforementioned had given his approval to make use of it what was not It implied no abuse of their rights. In that instance, the court appointed the accusers to pay for the securities that involved the first confrontation. The fight did not end there and the accusing party, imputed to stronger instances, appealed to the Constitutional Court where finally, the ruling was in favor of the accusing party, giving the final opinion of perjury and derision to the interviewee. After finishing Cr√≥nicas marcianas, he collaborated again with his brother Alfonso Ar√∫s and his sister Angie C√°rdenas on Tan a gustito (2006) on TVE, making challenges with celebrities, such as the one he made with Carlos Baute making a dive with sharks in the aquarium of Barcelona.

Several species have been used in biocontrol programs. They are closely related to the Opiinae.  Description and distribution  Head of an Alysiinae wasp. The exodont mandibles are visible. Alysiinae are small wasps, usually under 5 mm long and black or brown in color. Their mandibles are exodont, opening outwards and not overlapping. This characteristic is unique among braconids, with a few rare exceptions. Alysiinae are found worldwide.  Biology  Alysiinae are koinobiont endoparasitoids of cyclorrhaphus Diptera. Females oviposit into host eggs or larvae. The host is allowed to develop until it forms a puparium, at which point it is killed by the wasp larva. The Alysiinae larva then pupates within the host puparium. Adults use their exodont mandibles to break free of the tough host puparium. Most species of Alysiinae are solitary, but a few are gregarious and lay multiple eggs within one host. thumb Genera These 43 genera belong to the subfamily Alysiinae: * Alloea Haliday, 1833 c g * Alysia Latreille, 1804 i c g b * Alysiasta Wharton, 1980 c g b * Angelovia Zaykov, 1980 c g * Aphaereta F√∂rster, 1862 c g b * Apronopa van Achterberg, 1980 c g * Aristelix Nixon, 1943 c g * Asobara F√∂rster, 1862 i c g b * Asyntactus Marshall, 1896 c g * Carinthilota Fischer, 1975 c g * Chasmodon Haliday, 1838 c g b * Chorebus Haliday, 1833 i c g b * Coelinidea Viereck, 1913 c g * Coelinius Nees von Esenbeck, 1818 c g b (coelinius nees) * Cratospila F√∂rster, 1862 c g * Dapsilarthra F√∂rster, 1862 c g b * Dinotrema F√∂rster, 1862 c g b * Eucoelinidea Tobias, 1971 c g * Eudinostigma Tobias, 1986 c g * Grandia Goidanich, 1936 c g * Idiasta Foerster c g * Lodbrokia Hedqvist, 1962 c g * Mesocrina F√∂rster, 1862 c g b * Oenonogastra Ashmead, 1900 c g b * Orthostigma Ratzeburg, 1844 c g b * Panerema F√∂rster, 1862 c g * Pentapleura F√∂rster, 1862 c g b * Phaenocarpa F√∂rster, 1862 i c g b * Phasmalysia Tobias, 1971 c g * Protochorebus Perepetchayenko, 1997 c g * Protodacnusa Griffiths, 1964 c g * Pseudopezomachus Mantero, 1905 c g * Pterusa Fischer, 1958 c g * Regetus Papp, 1999 c g * Sarops Nixon, 1942 c g * Symphanes F√∂rster, 1862 c g * Synaldis F√∂rster, 1862 c g * Syncrasis F√∂rster, 1862 c g * Tanycarpa F√∂rster, 1862 c g * Tates Nixon, 1943 c g * Terebrebus Tobias, 1999 c g * Trachionus Haliday, 1833 c g b * Trachyusa Ruthe, 1854 c g Data sources: i = ITIS, c = Catalogue of Life, g = GBIF, b = Bugguide.net References  External links  * Photographs at BugGuide.net * DNA barcodes at BOLD systems Braconidae Hymenoptera subfamilies ","title":"Alysiinae"},{"id":"54294827","text":"The Aloys Bilz House is a private house located at 107 South Division Street in Spring Lake, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The house is remarkably unaltered from its original look in 1872. History Aloys Bilz was born in 1841 in Dupplesgrun, Bohemia to Joseph and Margaret Bilz of Bavaria. In 1850, the family emigrated to Buffalo, New York. In 1854, Aloys apprenticed himself to a tinsmith, and spent the next few years learning the trade. Starting in 1857, he supervised a tin shop in New Baltimore, Michigan, where he worked until 1863. In 1864, Bilz married Mary Alice Thompson, then moved to various communities until settling in Spring Lake in 1866 and opening a tin shop and hardware business. The business was quickly profitable, and in six months, Bilz purchased this plot of land on which he built a shop and house. (note: large pdf file) However, in 1871, fire destroyed the community, including Bilz's shop and house. Following the fire, Bilz rebuilt his business, and constructed this new house on the site of his previous one. Bilz also rebuilt his business, and went on to invest in other business interests in the Spring Lake area, as well as serve as village president for ten years. He lived in the house until his death in 1934. Bilz's son, William A. Bilz (born 1880), was also active in the community, operated his father's hardware store, and lived in the same house. He lived in the house until his death in 1940. After this, his W. Preston Bilz inherited the house and lived here until his own death in 1983. Description The Aloys Bilz House is an L-shapes, two-story Italianate house with a gabled roof and brick foundation. It is clad with clapboard. The roofline gables have classical cornices with returns, echoing a Greek Revival style, but it has mainly Italianate details, including paired brackets under the eaves and arched window and door openings. The main entrance to the house is through a porch on the inside of the L. On the inside, the first floor contains an entry hall with stairway, and a sitting/dining room, parlor, and master bedroom off the entry hall. A kitchen, pantry, and day room are in the rear, within a single-story extension. The second floor is smaller than the first, and contains three bedrooms and a bathroom.

DHB is synthesized from chorismic acid by a series of enzymes: VibA, VibB, and VibC. DHB is linked to NSPD by VibE, VibB and VibH in order and forms DHB-NSPD. On the other hand, DHB performs condensation and cyclization with Thr by VibE, VibB, and VibF to form the heterocyclic molecule linked on VibF: DHB-Thr-VibF.

Biography Vasyl Grigorovich-Barsky (left) depicted on a Ukrainian coin Grigorovich- Barsky was born in Litky near Kiev. He came from a rich merchant family originally from the town of Bar in Podillia. Vasyl's younger brother Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi became a well-known architect. In 1715, the family moved to Kyiv, where Vasyl's father served as a prefect of Pyrohoshcha Church. Against his father's will, Vasyl enlisted in the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. However, in 1723 he had to leave the studies due to ill health and traveled to Lviv (then part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) to seek medical advice. There Hryhorovych-Barskyi, disguised as a Uniate, became a student in a Jesuit academy. In 1724, after a conflict at the academy, Grigorovich-Barsky left Lviv and started his journey, during which he visited Pest, Vienna, Bari, Rome, Venice, Corfu, Mount Athos, Palestine, Egypt and Cyprus. In Alexandria Grigorovich-Barsky lived at the court of the Patriarch. In 1729-1731 he stayed in Tripoli, learning Greek. After arriving at Patmos in 1734, Grigorovich- Barsky became a monk, spending the next six years at the local monastery. In 1743 he was appointed a priest at the Russian embassy in Constantinople by empress Yelizaveta Petrovna, and for the next two years studied documents in the libraries of Mount Athos. Vasyl Grigorovich-Barsky were in Athos, Athens and Crete from 1744 to 1746. He returned to Constantinople in 1746, where he had a conflict with the new Russian diplomat, Adrian Ivanovich Neplyuev, who accused him for Philhellenism and betrayal of national interests. Vasyl was afraid to be arrested and wanted to prove the injustice of accusation against him. He returned to Kiev in the 2d of October 1747 through Bulgaria, Wallachia and Poland. As he was severe ill at that time, he died a month later.

Insulin was first isolated and successfully tested by Frederick Banting, working in J.R.R. Macleod's laboratory at the University of Toronto in early 1922. A large number of patients suffering from diabetes were on the verge of dying. The supply of insulin was insufficient to treat all the patients. The team at the University of Toronto had inconsistent results in purifying insulin and eventually turned to Eli Lilly for help. George Walden started working for Eli Lilly in 1917, at which time he was paid $85 each month. George Walden was the head chemist at Eli Lilly in 1922. Previous attempts at purification of insulin attempted to keep the insulin in solution and precipitate out the contaminating proteins. Walden found that if he adjusted the pH to produce the maximum precipitation, the precipitate contained highly purified insulin. His process yielded insulin that was 10 to 100 times more pure than previous batches.

Democrats swept all of the city races but saw their vote totals much reduced from those of four years earlier, owing to a growing graft scandal in city government. District Attorney James C. Crumlish, Jr. and City Controller Alexander Hemphill, both incumbents, were returned to office. Several ballot questions were also approved, including one permitting limited sales of alcohol on Sundays. Background Easily reelected in 1959, Mayor Richardson Dilworth grew less popular by 1961. In 1957 and 1959, Philadelphia Democrats had achieved citywide victories over the Republicans, capping a string of electoral wins that had begun in 1951. Their 1959 victory, especially, indicated a complete domination of the city's politics as Mayor Richardson Dilworth carried 58 of 59 wards in his reelection bid; he and other Democrats running for citywide seats took nearly two-thirds of the vote. It was followed up by a resounding success in the presidential election of 1960, when Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy carried the state thanks to a 330,000-vote majority in Philadelphia. The coalition of independent reformers and organization Democrats looked to further increase their success in 1961, with Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green, Jr., predicting a margin of 100,000 votes in the off-year election. As the election neared, however, some cracks began to show in the Democrats' dominance. Dilworth held a neighborhood meeting to announce a plan to charge for parking in South Philadelphia, and was pelted with rocks and garbage in a near-riot. Even more embarrassing to a party that had been elected on a platform of reform was an investigation that year into political corruption and bribery in City Hall. Republicans demanded that a grand jury be convened to investigate further, but Judge Raymond Pace Alexander (who had served as a Democratic city councilman from 1952 to 1959) rejected their petition. While Green asked voters for \\"indorsement for continuance in office on solid accomplishments,\\" Republican City Committee chairman Wilbur H. Hamilton drew attention to the scandals and called the erstwhile reform movement a \\"broken idol\\" that \\"promised much and delivered little.\\" District Attorney 1961 Philadelphia District Attorney's race by ward, with Crumlish in blue and Smith in red Philadelphia elects a district attorney independently of the mayor, in a system that predates the charter change. Since 1957, district attorney elections have followed mayoral and city council elections by two years. In that year, Philadelphians reelected Victor H. Blanc as District Attorney of Philadelphia by a thirteen- percentage-point margin. Three years later, Governor David L. Lawrence appointed Blanc to the court of common pleas. Blanc's first assistant, Paul M. Chalfin, served as acting district attorney while the common pleas judges decided on a replacement who would serve until the 1961 election. The fight for the interim post became a battle between political factions with Green's preferred candidate, James C. Crumlish, Jr., getting the judges' approval in March 1961. Crumlish ran for a full four-year term that fall. Republicans nominated Theodore B. Smith, Jr., a former assistant district attorney who had been in private practice since 1958, without primary opposition. Smith and the Republicans accused Crumlish of being a tool of the Democratic party machine and said that he covered up corruption in the graft investigation. Democrats were confident of an easy victory for Crumlish, but he won by just 47,000 votes. The margin was far less than expected and the worst showing for Democrats in a district attorney contest since 1947. Crumlish trailed all citywide Democratic candidates, which The Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Joseph C. Goulden attributed to the growing perception of corruption in the party, and in the district attorney's office in particular. City Controller Philadelphia elects a City Controller to sit at the head of an independent auditing department. The Controller approves all payments made out of the city treasury and audits the executive departments. As an independently elected official, the Controller is not responsible to the mayor or the city council. The office was created under the 1919 City Charter and later given expanded powers as one of the good-government reforms intended to reduce the corruption that had previously plagued city government and led to the reform coalition of 1951. Democrat Alexander Hemphill had been elected to the office in 1957 and ran for reelection. He was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in Democratic politics who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951. Hemphill was the organization's nominee in 1957, but often clashed with Dilworth and others. His investigation had brought to light the initial evidence leading to the graft charges against members of his own party. Hemphill's opponent was Joseph C. Bruno, a West Philadelphia lawyer, who fended off a surprisingly strong primary protest vote for Joseph A. Schafer, an accountant from Northeast Philadelphia. Despite Hemphill's investigation into the alleged misconduct, the Democratic Party's scandals reduced his totals as well, though still giving him a 55,000-vote victory over Bruno. Hemphill continued in office until 1967, when he resigned to run for mayor. Judges and magistrates Although Pennsylvania's judges are elected in partisan elections, there had been a tradition of not challenging the re- election of incumbents. To that end, judicial candidates were typically endorsed by both major parties but in 1953 Democrats broke the informal pact and endorsed just three of the sitting judges, resulting in an unusually intense contest. By 1957, the old order was mostly re-established as all but one of the sitting judges were endorsed for re-election by both parties and returned to office without opposition. In 1961, four common pleas court judges and two orphans' court judges were on the ballot, and all were cross-endorsed in accordance with the sitting-judge principle. All were reelected to ten-year terms, including Victor H. Blanc, the former district attorney. There were also seven seats open for magistrate, a local court, the duties of which have since been superseded by the Philadelphia Municipal Court. In the magistrate races, a limited voting law meant that each political party could nominate four candidates, and voters could only vote for four, with the result being that the majority party could only take four of the seven seats, leaving three for the minority party. The Democrats took the maximum number of four magistracies, with all four of their incumbents being reelected, led by Harry C. Schwartz. The remaining three seats went to Republicans, with one spot going to the only GOP incumbent on the ballot, Thomas A. Connor. The other two Republicans elected were 42nd Ward leader John P. Walsh and former police captain Luke A. McBride, who edged out court stenographer George J. Woods. Ballot questions At the May primary, two referendums were proposed; the first would permit Sunday alcohol sales in hotels that had liquor licenses, the second would borrow $10 million for school construction. Both passed, gathering 67.6% and 75.9% of the vote, respectively. In November, five more questions were on the ballot, all asking the voters' permission to borrow money for various infrastructure improvements. All five, approving a total of $65 million in loans, passed by a two-to-one margin. Aftermath The 1961 election confirmed the Democrats in power, but their reduced margins and increased association with machine politics signaled the beginning of the end for the party's coalition with independent good government reformers. Dilworth, in particular, saw the election as a warning sign, telling the party that they must \\"watch your Ps and Qs\\" to avoid further setbacks. Even so, Green's control over federal patronage through the Kennedy administration and Dilworth's resignation in 1962 to run for governor left the Democratic Party fully in the hands of the ward leaders.

Funding model  The Center aims to engage corporate philanthropists to support its research initiatives. Through private funding and partnerships, it aims to build an endowment, which will be used to distribute annual grants to Center scientists. In April 2016, the Center for Climate and Life partnered with the World Surf League (WSL). The philanthropic arm of the organization, WSL PURE, contributed $1.5 million to the Center to fund five research projects on the topics of ocean health and ecosystems, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and the role the oceans play in climate change.  Areas of emphasis  Center for Climate and Life initiatives focus on five areas: * Food security * Water availability * Shelter * Sustainable energy solutions * Ocean health  Research and education initiatives  Research by Center for Climate and Life scientists is focused on understanding how climate change will affect people and the basic resources and ecosystems that sustain them. Center activities address the widening ‚Äúclimate innovation gap‚Äù between the increasing need for knowledge and solutions, and declining federal support for climate and solutions research. The Center works with public and private sector partners to help stakeholders understand how climate-related impacts on essential resources will affect their bottom line and thereby guide rational business and policy decisions. The Center supports Climate and Life Fellows, who lead research projects on topics central to its mission. In 2016, the Center administered its first two grants to early career scientists: hydrologist Michael Puma of Columbia University's Center for Climate Systems Research and NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies received a $190,000 grant to study the impact of climate change on global food systems, and bioclimatologist A.

The book appears ninth in the 75 fascicle version of the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, and it is ordered 44th in the later chronological 95 fascicle \\"Honzan edition\\". It was presented to his students in the fourth month of 1243 at Rokuharamitsu-ji, a temple in a neighborhood of eastern Kyoto populated primarily by military officials of the new Kamakura shogunate. This was the same location where he presented another book of the same collection called Zenki. Both were short works compared to others in the collection, and in both cases he was likely invited to present them at the behest of his main patron, Hatano Yoshishige, who lived nearby. Later in the same year, D≈çgen suddenly abandoned his temple K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji in Kyoto and began to establish Eihei-ji. The first half of the text stakes out a novel interpretation of the meaning of the term Kobutsu (Âè§‰Ωõ), literally meaning \\"Old Buddha\\". While typically the term had been used to refer to the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity, D≈çgen uses it to refer to all of those before him who have passed on the Zen tradition. More specifically, D≈çgen denies the duality of the buddhas of the ancient past and the practitioners of the more recent past and present. He then supports this usage by citing examples from Zen records of the past teachers Tiantong Rujing, Yuanwu Keqin, Sushan Guangren, and Xuefeng Yicun. The second half of the text focuses on the full term used as the title of the book, Kobutushin (Âè§‰ΩõÂøÉ), literally \\"Old Buddha Mind\\". He does so through the presentation of a famous saying from Nanyang Huizhong, the so-called \\"National Teacher\\", who said the old buddha mind is nothing other than \\"fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles\\", which is to say everyday reality and the phenomena that comprise it. D≈çgen then engages in his characteristic wordplay by rearranging the characters of the term, speaking of \\"old Buddha\\", \\"old mind\\", and even the strange expression \\"Buddha old\\". To conclude, he cites Jianyuan Zhongxing, who said that \\"old buddha mind\\" is the same as \\"the world collapses in ruins\\", before finally putting this phrase in his own terms, writing that the old buddha mind must be \\"sloughed off\\" to really know the old buddha mind. He also reiterates that the old buddha mind extends to times both before and after the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity.

His \\"signal achievements\\" were his East Anglian excavations, including four years spent by Caister-on-Sea and Burgh Castle, and several weeks in 1961 as Director of excavations at Walsingham Priory. Green additionally brought his \\"long experience of boat-handling\\" to bear in writing his 1963 book, Sutton Hoo: The Excavation of a Royal Ship-Burial, a major work that combined a popular account of the Anglo-Saxon burial with Green's contributions about ship-construction and seafaring. Green began his career in archaeology as an assistant at the Salford Royal Museum, and in 1932 was named curator of The Museum of Gloucester. Much of his East Anglian work was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s on behalf of the Ministry of Works. Green was also a member of the National Executive of the Council for British Archaeology, a one time President of the Norfolk Research Committee, and, at his death, the President of the Great Yarmouth Archaeological Society and Vice-President of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society.  Career  Charles Green was born in Lancaster, England, in 1901. He began his archaeological career as an assistant at the Royal Museum in Salford, Greater Manchester, and in 1932 he was appointed curator of The Museum of Gloucester. There, he studied the prehistory of Gloucestershire, undertaking a study of Roman Gloucester and publishing several papers, including an important 1949 note on the burials found in Birdlip. The Royal Air Force took Green under its wing during World War II; he served in the photographic and intelligence branches, befitting his archaeological interest in air photography. During the 1950s, Green carried out many excavations for the Ministry of Works, difficult work for an understaffed department. In 1951, he arrived in East Anglia, which would become the site of his \\"signal achievements\\", to excavate the Roman town at Caister-on-Sea, close to Great Yarmouth and across from Burgh Castle. Green spent four years continuously excavating there, from the summer of 1951 to January 1955, chronicling the rise and fall of the town. This work gave him experience with the fluctuations of the North Sea, leading to his contribution to the 1960 book The Making of the Broads. From 1958 to 1960, also for the Ministry of Works, Green excavated a nearly plough-destroyed barrow cemetery in Shrewton, a village near Stonehenge. This led to a paper read to the Prehistoric Society in 1960, and a posthumous publication in 1984. Green continued excavations in East Anglia in the 1960s, including several weeks spent at Walsingham Priory; an article on the excavations was published in 1968. In this decade he also published at least four papers in Norfolk Archaeology. He was credited with \\"a far-seeing interdisciplinary approach\\" for \\"A Human Skull from Runham, Norfolk\\" (1961) and \\"Broadland Fords and Causeways\\" (1961), \\"historical topography\\" in \\"The Lost Vill of Ness\\" (1969), and \\"emergent industrial archaeological considerations\\" for the \\"entrancing\\" \\"Herring-Nets and Beatsters\\" (1969). = Sutton Hoo = In 1963 Green published Sutton Hoo: The Excavation of a Royal Ship-Burial. It is considered a major work about the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, a high-status grave from the seventh century. The book benefited from Green's considerable experience in boat-handling along Western Ireland and the entirety of the North Sea, giving him a realistic perspective on the capabilities of Anglo-Saxon ships, and was said to reflect \\"adventurous, though scientific, sea-faring\\". Sutton Hoo: The Excavation of a Royal Ship-Burial was reviewed as a popular account of the excavation, offering \\"a convenient peg on which to hang the more original chapters of the book\\". The first half of the work retold the story, published elsewhere and in more detail, of the burial; as the archaeologist Brian Hope- Taylor noted, \\"it is as though the British Museum's Provisional Guide, which most of us have known since it was so-thick, has suddenly filled out on reaching its middle teens\\". Green \\"claim[ed] no originality for these chapters of his book\\"; according to another reviewer, \\"[t]here is no originality in his conclusions that the burial took place in the third quarter of the seventh century, and that the person it commemorates was a prominent member, indeed almost certainly a king, of the East Anglian royal family.\\" Green's original contribution came in the second half of the book, where he discussed ship- construction from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Viking Age, and the problems of navigating the North Sea in keelless boats such as the Sutton Hoo ship. He concluded that the Sutton Hoo ship was not as well constructed as were later Viking ships, could not have supported a sail, and could not have safely withstood open sailing in the North Sea. Travel from East Anglia to Schleswig, near modern day Denmark, would have required hugging the coastline, he suggested, resulting in a trip that could have taken up to two months. Green revisited the topic of sea-travel in his later years. Shortly before his 1972 death, he had been undertaking a work on early sea-travel, especially the raids along the coasts of Roman Britain made by the Picts in their curraghs. = Organizations = Green was made a member of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society in 1953. Starting in 1964, he was the Vice-President of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society. He was formerly the President of the Norfolk Research Committee, and President of the Great Yarmouth Archaeological Society; he was also an early member of the National Executive of the Council for British Archaeology, helping guide it in its early years.  Personal life  Green had a daughter, Barbara Green. She was also an archaeologist, and served as keeper of archaeology at Norwich Castle from 1963 until 1992. Charles Green was living in Ormesby St Margaret in 1971, and died the following year.

He is also the initiator of the 6/24-Supportainment-campaign.  Life  Leonhard Kubizek was born in Krumau am Kamp in the Austrian Waldviertel on September 1, 1963, the son of cellist and violist da gamba Elli Lewinsky (1933-1987) and composer and choir director Augustin Kubizek (1918-2009). He was the second of four siblings; Gabriele Hu√ü, Michael Kubizek and Maria Bader-Kubizek. He has played the piano since age four, learning with his parents and, since 1969, with Professor Renate Kramer-Preisenhammer. With nine years he practiced the clarinet under Rudolf Jettel at the then - Wiener Musikakademie.  Career  = Music = Kubizek made his first professional appearance at the age of 15, soon establishing a successful career as a solo clarinettist. In 1982, he was awarded ‚ÄúMusician of the year‚Äù by the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) and was a prize-winner at the International Young Musician of the year-contest. In 1983, he made his debut as a soloist at the Salzburg Festival, playing Mozart‚Äôs Clarinet Concerto, and had his first One-Man-Show at the Viennese Konzerthaus titled ‚ÄúMagicsound‚Äù. Building up on the success and experience, he was able to play concerts around the globe, as well as work for Television, Radio and Record labels, providing the chance to work with world-renowned Orchestras (among others the Vienna Symphony and Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and personalities like Leonard Bernstein. = Writing = In 1986, eight years after his first solo concert, Kubizek had a complete psychological and physical breakdown, which he would later refer to as ‚ÄúPerformer‚Äôs Burn-Out‚Äù or ‚ÄúPerformer‚Äôs Success Syndrome‚Äù. He eventually went through reorientation, moving to the United States and using the name Pat Leonhard, studying Directing and Screenwriting, as well as clinical hypnosis and Neuro-Associative-Conditioning. He intensively researched various ways of learning, conditioning and reproduction of artistic and scientific potentials. As explorations went on, he developed a modern approach, these days known as mymozartScan, which he also taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna. In a little while he had a well-known name as a mental-coach and counsellor, working successfully with numerous performing artists, orchestras, TV-companies and movie-productions, in addition to corporations and project-based corporation-structures in the US and Europe. He has also worked as a sketch writer for a Pittsburgh-based TV comedy-program. = Other ventures = In 2000 Kubizek developed and designed the ‚ÄúbeGeisterwerkstatt‚Äù in Austria, his home country. It was a tourism and theatre business he managed and ran until 2011. It provided possibilities for unconventional forms of entertainment and had 350,000 visitors. The experience delivered many insights about playful learning, and helped further develop mymozartScan. Kubizek takes great concern in the destigmatization of Burn-out-Sndrome. He also taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna.  Personal life  Kubizek has four children, and lives in Vienna, Austria.

History  The station opened in April 1849 by the East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway. The station was situated east of the level crossing on New Road. There were five freight sidings at the station, northwest of the level crossing on the down side with a long head shunt. In 1913 livestock was handled here but there were no general goods facilities; only 'bulk traffic' was dealt with. NER figures of 1911 revealed that 368 people lived within the settlement and only 4405 tickets were sold in the year. During the First World War, most lightly used station closed during 1916‚Äì17, although Hessay closed as early as 22 September 1915. A reason for this was due to its closeness to Marston Moor. There was no distinct reopening date for Hessay after the First World War had ended. One service had appeared in the Bradshaw timetable in June 1919 for York passengers, but only on Saturdays. In Reid's timetable of June 1920, 'Hessay (closed)' confusingly appeared with an up service for c9:15am and a down service for c3:39pm for York passengers and, again, on Saturdays only. In July 1922, services were restored for all weekdays. When the Second World War began, War Department sidings were built at the station on the down side and south west of the existing sidings. Like Goldsborough, there were also wartime additions to the infrastructure, including a blast proof signal box. The station closed to passengers on 15 September 1958. Goods continued to be handled at the station until 4 May 1964 but the War Department sidings continued to be used by the Ministry of Defence until 1991.

Following extensive refurbishment work the building was re-opened by the Duke of Connaught in May 1905. The Queen's Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Brigade became the 4th and 5th (Queen's Edinburgh Rifles) Battalions, the Royal Scots in 1908.

Prime Minister Juha Sipil√§ (Centre Party) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) announced on 12 June that they would no longer cooperate in a coalition government with the Finns Party after Jussi Halla-aho was elected party chairman. The crisis resolved on 13 June when twenty MPs defected from the Finns Party's parliamentary group, forming what would eventually become the Blue Reform party. Sipil√§'s government retained a majority in Finland's parliament as the Blue Reform continued as a member of the coalition.  Background  Prior to the crisis, the Finns Party had 37 MPs in the Finnish parliament and was represented in the Sipil√§ Cabinet by five ministers. Timo Soini, the long-time chair of the party and Minister for Foreign Affairs, announced in March 2017 that he would step down at the upcoming party conference in Jyv√§skyl√§, scheduled for June. Sampo Terho, the Minister for European Affairs and Culture, and Jussi Halla-aho, a Member of the European Parliament, emerged as the strongest candidates to succeed Soini. The party establishment was believed to support Terho against Halla-aho, a hardline critic of immigration and multiculturalism. In the leadership election on 10 June, Halla-aho won majority of the party members' votes in the first round and was thus elected chair of the Finns Party. On the same day, Laura Huhtasaari, Teuvo Hakkarainen and Juho Eerola, all aligned with Halla-aho, were elected vice chairs of the party. Upon his election, Halla-aho pledged to take the party in a more nationalistic and Eurosceptic direction. The result was described a \\"revolution\\" by Helsingin Sanomat and Prime Minister Juha Sipil√§ stated that the Finns Party was not the same party as before.  Events  In the morning of 12 June, Sipil√§ and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo, the leaders of the Centre Party and National Coalition Party respectively, negotiated on the continuation of the coalition government with Halla-aho at Kes√§ranta. Soon after, Sipil√§ and Orpo both tweeted that they would not cooperate with Halla-aho's party. Ending the coalition with the Finns Party was accepted by the parliamentary groups of the Centre Party and the NCP. It was expected that Sipil√§ would soon formally ask President Sauli Niinist√∂ to remove his cabinet from office. Opposition leaders Ville Niinist√∂ and Li Andersson demanded a snap election to be held, but the Centre Party and the NCP were expected to form a new government with the Swedish People's Party and the Christian Democrats without a new election. This government coalition would have had 101 MPs, the narrowest possible parliamentary majority. However, on 13 June, twenty MPs left the Finns Party parliamentary group and formed a new group called the New Alternative. Its members included Soini, Terho and all other cabinet ministers that had formerly represented the Finns Party. The New Alternative was willing to continue as a member of the government coalition, which was approved by Sipil√§ and Orpo and their parliamentary groups. The new government coalition had 106 MPs. The crisis did not cause changes to the composition of Sipil√§'s cabinet. On 19 June, Terho announced that a new party would be formed based on the New Alternative parliamentary group under the name Blue Reform.  Views on the crisis  According to Halla-aho, Sipil√§ expelled the Finns Party from the government because he could not accept Halla-aho's demand to follow the immigration policy agreed in the government programme. Sipil√§ and Orpo said that they and Halla-aho did not share the same values and also found it problematic that Halla-aho was going to lead his party from Brussels instead of becoming a cabinet minister in Helsinki. Blue Reform members explained their departure from the Finns Party by alleging that Halla-aho's supporters had hijacked the party. Soini blamed the far-right nationalist group Suomen Sisu for the schism within the party.Friday's papers: Hijab hate, political \\"purges\\" and Green leadership vote, Yle, 16 June 2017 Tiina Elovaara, one of the defecting MPs, reported witnessing Halla-aho's supporters making Nazi salutes during the party conference in Jyv√§skyl√§,Thursday's papers: Taco Bell arrives, Finns Party divorce, human smuggling and abortions in decline, Yle, 15 June 2017 later specifying she was referring to a specific photograph taken at the conference. However, the accusation was later debunked as the picture was taken on the day following the election and actually depicted participants engaging in show-of-hands voting. Halla-aho pointed out that he had been democratically elected chair by Finns Party members.

After synthesis, the hydrophilic polysaccharide dextran is rendered insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents. This allows it to be processed in the same manner as many polyesters, like poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), through processes like solvent evaporation and emulsion. Acetalated dextran is structurally different from acetylated dextran. History Acetalated dextran was first reported in 2008 out of the lab of Jean Fr√©chet at the University of California, Berkeley in the College of Chemistry. This version of acetalated dextran, often abbreviated Ac-DEX, has dextran and exceedingly low levels of acetone and methanol as degradation products. In 2012, in the laboratory of Kristy Ainslie, at Ohio State University in the College of Pharmacy, polymer synthesis was modified to release ethanol in place of methanol upon degradation. The ethanol producing version of acetalated dextran is often abbreviated Ace-DEX. Properties Cyclic and acyclic acetals on acetalated dextran which degrades to dextran, acetone, and ethanol. During the synthesis of acetalated dextran both acyclic and cyclic acetals are formed. The acyclic acetals degrade into an acetone and an alcohol, whereas cyclic acetals degrade into acetone. The ratio of cyclic to acyclic acetals varies with reaction time since acyclic acetals are kinetically favored and cyclic acetals are the thermodynamically favored. This unique formation of cyclic and acyclic acetals leads to varying degradation time because the two acetal groups hydrolyze at different rates. Acetalated dextran's degradation time can vary from hours to a month or more at pH 7.2. Also, acetalated dextran is unique because it is acid sensitive. Therefore, at lower pH acetalated dextran degrades more rapidly, which results in a polymer that degrades approximately two logs faster at pH 5 compared to pH 7. The acid-sensitivity of Ac-DEX has illustrated, when formulated into nanoparticles encapsulating a protein antigen, more efficient presentation of antigen to both MHC class I and MHC class II, over other non-acid sensitive polymers like PLGA and non degradable materials like gold nanoparticles. Applications Because of the ability of acetalated dextran to degrade more rapidly in low pH environments like the phagolysosome of a macrophage or dendritic cell, it has been used as polymeric micro/nanoparticles. Acetalated dextran was originally developed as a vaccine carrier, but has been used for drug delivery, tissue engineering and infectious disease vaccine delivery. Its unique degradation rates have led to finely tuned release of therapeutic proteins and vaccine elements. Ac-DEX has also been shown the allow proteins to be stored outside the cold chain.

This unit became the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots, in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to Alexandria and then to the Western Front. The 5th and 6th battalions, both heavily depleted, were amalgamated in July 1916, and spent the remainder of war on the Western Front as the 5/6th. After the war, the 6th Battalion remained in Belgium until January 1919 when it moved into Germany, and was reduced to a cadre in October 1919 and sent home to be disbanded.Paterson, Vol I, Appendix 5 After the war the battalion formed a battery in the 57th (Lowland) Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery based elsewhere in the city. The drill hall instead became the headquarters of 2 (Scottish) General Hospital and of 155 (Lowland) Field Ambulance. These units evolved to become 50 (Scottish) Casualty Clearing Station in 1967 and that unit amalgamated with other units to form 205 (Scottish) General Hospital in 1967. After the Edinburgh detachment of 205 (Scottish) General Hospital moved out to the Granton Square drill hall in the late 1990s, the Gilmore Place drill hall was decommissioned and, although the hall itself was demolished, the houses that formed the frontage of the property were returned to residential use.

Several Rogadinae species parasitize pest caterpillars and are important for naturally occurring biological control.  Description and distribution  Rogadinae are small wasps, usually under 8mm long. They are cyclostomes and usually have a medial ridge on the abdomen. They are found worldwide. The cosmopolitan genus Aleiodes, Old World genus Rogas, and New World genus Triraphis are by far the most common and species rich.  Biology  Rogadinae are koinobiont endoparasitoids of Lepidopteran larvae. Females oviposit into host larvae. The host is allowed to develop as the wasp larvae feeds internally on its tissues. Rogadines are unique among braconids in that their host caterpillar is eventually reduced to a mummified husk. The wasp larva then pupate within the mummy. Host mummies are distinctive and can be used to identify the species. Many Rogadinae are nocturnal as adults.

Background  After Supermachiner released Rise of the Great Machine and after Converge had completed recording Jane Doe, Bannon started writing and recording solo material. A number of releases were lined up; however, none of them saw the light of day. The album was originally planned to be a double album titled Wear Your Wounds released by Icarus Records an imprint label of Bannon's label Deathwish. In January 2005, Bannon's solo recordings were said to have been in the editing and mixing process, and it was believed there would be multiple releases which would include the Wear Your Wounds double album throughout the year; however, this did not happen. Initially planning since 2008 on releasing solo music under his name only, in 2012 Bannon began using the Wear Your Wounds name for these projects. This allowed others to collaborate and work with Bannon on future projects. As early as January 21, 2014, Bannon had been in the studio tracking and mixing material for the album. The album has multiple guest musicians such as Kurt Ballou (Converge), Mike McKenzie (The Red Chord, Stomach Earth, Unraveller), Chris Maggio (Sleigh Bells, Trap Them, Coliseum), and Sean Martin (Hatebreed, Cage, Kid Cudi, Twitching Tongues). On January 13, 2017, Bannon announced a release date of April 7, 2017 for the album. Along with the announcement, the single \\"Goodbye Old Friend\\" was released. On February 7, 2017, the music video for \\"Wear Your Wounds\\" was released, was directed by Max Moore. Bannon said: \\"The song is about the psychological effects of negative experiences, and ultimately not allowing them to define who are and wish to be [...] I feel that most people can likely relate to that message in some way. The video is a recreation of the album cover and other visuals in the album. The character creates a ladder to ascend to the sky.

Biography  James Legrand Powers was born in Odessa, Ukraine (then the Russian Empire) in 1871. He graduated from Odessa Technical School and worked in the Odessa University mechanical shop. In 1889, he emigrated to the United States and was employed by various engineering concerns including Western Electric. In 1907, Powers was hired by the US Census Bureau as a mechanical expert to modify unit record equipment invented two decades earlier by Herman Hollerith. Hollerith's equipment was successfully used for the 1890 and 1900 US Censuses, but when Hollerith refused to lower the rental fees for the Census Bureau, the Bureau's director S.N.D. North did not renew the contract with Hollerith's company, creating instead the Census Machine Shop. Powers had already done some experimental work on office machines and received several patents. He managed to circumvent Hollerith's patents and introduced new punched card equipment which was used in the 1910 US Census. James Powers died on 8 November 1927 in New York, and the obituary appeared in New York Times two days later.  Powers Accounting Machine Company  Powers founded his company in 1911 as Powers Tabulating Machine Company but later changed its name to Powers Accounting Machine Company. Founded in Newark, New Jersey, the company was moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1914. By 1914, Powers Accounting Machine Company is said to have subsidiaries in Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy; however, the information about them is scarce. German and Bulgarian subsidiaries are said to have been closed during the First World War. Nevertheless, the German agency was re-established in 1923. In 1915, the Prudential Building Society founded Accounting and Tabulating Company of Great Britain which sold Powers's machines. The French subsidiary SAMAS (a.k.a. S.A.M.A.S. for Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Machines √† Statistiques) was established in 1922, alongside the Belgian agency in 1919. In 1927 the Remington Typewriter Company and the Rand Kardex Corporation merged, forming Remington Rand Inc., which acquired the Powers Accounting Machine Company within a year. After several more mergers, the company became known as Unisys Corporation, which it is today.  Inventions  Mechanical hole-sensing unit Hollerith's tabulating equipment employed an electric sensing unit in which perforations in cards acted as \\"make and break\\" electric switches, thus allowing current to pass and energize electromagnetic counters. Since Hollerith was the originator of the technology, his patents protected the electric card reading technique, which meant that the Census Bureau couldn't use it without infringing Hollerith's patents. Powers devised a mechanical sensing unit, which in action was similar to a typewriter. For reading, a set of rods fixed on springs fell on a card. Rods went through the holes of the card and pushed the buttons placed underneath. These buttons acted as an input mechanism connected mechanically to a set of counters or a sorting device. Powers managed to invent his own system which bore no resemblance to Hollerith's one. The system included the whole set of machines, necessary for tabulating, namely, the electric card punch, card verifier, sorting machine, and printing tabulator. Printing tabulator Hollerith's tabulators were non-printing, displaying numbers on a row of mechanical counters. This caused pauses during tabulation, as it was necessary to write totals by hand. The Census Bureau Machine Shop introduced the first printing tabulator in 1906. Powers started to produce printing tabulators in 1911, and his machines soon gained popularity. Despite their complexity, they were largely deployed by insurance companies because of their ability to produce written spreadsheets. Powers Accounting Machine Company was the only producer of printing tabulators until IBM introduced its own version in 1920. Electric card punch In 1907, Powers was detailed to work out an automatic card-punching machine. 300 of these machines were ordered for the 1910 US Census. However, they proved to be unreliable and were soon rejected by the Census Bureau. Several years later Powers Accounting Machine Company advertised different types of electric card punches. Punch card verifier In 1910, Powers introduced the first card verifier, which was used to check the correctness of punching.

VNIITE (), named after the acronym for the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Industrial Design (), was the chief Soviet design research institute, established in April 1962, and closed in June 2013. It was created at the request of the State Committee on Science and Engineering of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. One its main objectives was to improve the quality of the design of Soviet products, in order to decrease the gap between the Soviet Union and the industrial power of Western countries.  History  When they first opened, the headquarters of the institute in Moscow were divided into nine key sections: Human Ressources; Design Theory and History; Design Promotion; Ergonomics; Materials, Colors and Finish; Information; Transportation Design; Consumer Product Design and Industrial Equipment Design. After five years, the VNIITE employed a workforce of 3,000 employees, with 15 branches spread across the Soviet Union. Large design offices (of 50 to 200 employees) were attached to the main industries, and other 200 smaller laboratories worked with individual factories. Almost none of the designs created by the VNIITE during its first period were ever produced industrially, but their concepts were used to show the power of design, and the prototypes were displayed in exhibitions. These initial concepts were for the most part directed towards industrial equipment, office furniture, transportation, and some consumer goods. From 1964 on, the VNIITE produced its own magazine, called Technical Aesthetics (a term invented in Russia to speak about industrial design). From the mid-1970s, the institute focused on a greater integration with the economies of the Eastern Bloc countries, and in particular with East Germany and Czechoslovakia.  Notable designers  The VNIITE was directed by designer Yuri Soloviev from its opening in 1962 to 1982, and he was a key figure to its development. When opening, as design was not an established field in Russia, the first employees to be hired by him were engineers, psychologists, historians, graphics, model- makers and other design aficionados. However, some of them revealed to be competent designers, including Boris Shekov (who became head of the Industrial Equipment Design department) and Yuri Dolmatovsky, who worked on the Transports department.

Baxter was born in Colorado on November 23, 1922. By the age of ten he was playing piano for dancing classes. He moved to Los Angeles at age 13, and became a professional musician during his teenage years. He intended music as a hobby, enrolling in the pre-med program at UCLA. These plans were interrupted by World War II, which he spent in the Army Air Force. Following his discharge, he did not return to his studies but instead joined Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra. He then joined Frankie Masters where he added arranging duties to his pianist abilities. He began playing the organ, which diversified his career opportunities. He was the organist for The Continental and made an album with Renzo Cesana for Capitol Records. Through the early 1950s, he was the staff organist at NBC's KNBH which meant he played for award presentations, audience participation shows, game shows, variety shows, and even a space program. At night, Baxter played in nightclubs in both Los Angeles and Las Vegas. He became a spokesperson for Western Airlines and toured while promoting that air carrier. He then became Lowery Organ Company's resident artist, then subsequently was their representative in the Southern California territory. Later in life he resided in Sherman Oaks, California. Baxter died August 21, 1998 in Mission Viejo, California. Baxter made a number of pipe-organ records. Some of his earlier efforts were not met with enthusiasm by the trade press, as Billboard called them \\"uninspiring\\" and gave them 2 stars. 1961 saw Baxter begin a series of LP records with Dot and these albums received much improved reviews from Billboard, which gave his albums 4 stars while noting he \\"played with feeling,\\" maximizing focus on the melody while utilizing minimal production.

Plot summary Green Rider Sir Karigan G'ladheon, returns from her unexpected trip through time in her traditional disruptive style, materialising above the great banquet hall and crashing through the mid-winter feast. She is confused and disoriented and screams for the man she left behind in the future to be reunited with her. Karigan tries to regain a sense of normality, recover from her injuries and move on from the heartbreak she suffered when Cade Harlow was ripped from her as she crossed over the threshold of time. During her return journey she sustains an injury, where a shard of magic mirror is embedded in her eye that transforms it into a mirror, anyone who gazes into it glimpses their possible future. Karigan's eye becomes incredibly painful, she keeps it covered with a patch and its prophetic properties are a closely guarded secret. Throughout the winter Karigan resumes her arms trains and the kings elite guard, the Weapons, deem her heroic deeds and combat skills worthy to formalise her status as swordmaster and honorary weapon imbuing her with more titles, responsibilities and benefits. Meanwhile, King Zachary of Sacoridia is struggling with his feelings for Karigan, and is becoming increasingly fatigued with his duty as king and as husband to new wife, Queen Estora. After their highly traumatic deathbed wedding, their relationship is somewhat strained, however Estora quickly becomes pregnant with twins which does begin to mend the rift. The castle is attacked by an ancient ice elemental the \\"Aureas Slee\\" who is being manipulated by the Second Empire. Slee is wounded and retreats but not before encountering the beautiful expectant Queen. Several visiting Eletians inform the King Zachary and his Captain, Laren Mapstone of a prophecy, that tells them the time to find the fourth race in the league that originally joined with Sacoridia, Eletia and Rhovanny to defeat Mornhaven the Black in the long war, is nigh and that he must send an emissary forth to meet with the p'ehdrosian race, that have not been seen in over a 1,000 years. Karigan is assigned her new mission, to seek out the legendary p'ehdrosian a race that resemble half moose, half human beings and to renew an alliance of old in the face of dire threats from enemies who seek to destroy Sacoridia using dark magic again. She is sent as an ambassador with an eletian guide named Enver, and her friend Estral Andovian. Once Karigan leaves the castle, the Aureas Slee stealthily spirits King Zachary away to its lair in the frozen north, and resumes his place fooling everyone including the Queen. As the imposter king grows more and more controlling of Queen Estora, his identity is revealed and he is ousted once more from the castle. The inhabitants of the castle rally, stepping up preparations for the coming war, Laren Mapstone is promoted to colonel and dispatches groups of riders and weapons to search the country for the missing king. Each step on Karigan journey northward grows more perilous as she faces attacks from groundmites, encounters with ghosts, and, ultimately, the threat of the necromancer and leader of Second Empire, Grandmother, as they approach the enemy encampment in the Lone Forest. King Zachary is imprisoned for some time within the Aureas Slee's icey domain along with an old eletian named Narvi. He escapes, and is unrecognisable with his wounds, but is captured immediately by Second Empire who are based in the north at an old fortification. He is forced to work as a slave digging up an ancient portal to the hells of the Sacoridian gods. Karigan arrives in the north and is also taken prisoner, where she is flogged and tortured. She and the king escape with the help of Enver and send word to a nearby military unit loyal to the king and prepare to take back the fort. Karigan is so badly wounded she is unable to go into battle. Second Empire succeed in opening the portal releasing dark creature that suck the life from anything they touch, the king is right in the midst of the danger and Karigan is called upon by the god Westrion to mount his steed Salvistar and appear as his avatar to contain the dark creatures and seal the portal. The king is wounded by one of the dark creatures but pulls through and begins his journey back to Sacor City, Karigan goes her separate way to search for the p'ehdrose who are just in the next valley albeit out of phase with the world, so Karigan uses her ability to cross the threshold. The reception she and Enver receive is mixed and strained, but Karigan uses her mirror eye to show the p'ehdrose a future where they are hunted to extinction. Karigan and Enver leave successful with a new alliance in place, however Enver becomes uncharacteristically agitated and reveals that he has been manipulated by the eletian council to mate with Karigan, sensing that he is about to become dangerous. Enver orders Karigan to flee from his presence. Meanwhile Rider Beryl Spencer has been hunting for Xandis Amberhill since Karigan returned from the future with her intel.

The film is based on a true story that was published in The Wall Street Journal about a group of grown men, played by Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, and Jeremy Renner, who spend one month a year playing the game of tag. Annabelle Wallis, Isla Fisher, Rashida Jones, and Leslie Bibb also star. It was released on June 15, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures, received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed over $78 million worldwide. Plot Hogan \\"Hoagie\\" Malloy, Bob Callahan, Randy \\"Chilli\\" Cilliano, Kevin Sable and Jerry Pierce have been playing the same game of tag since they were nine years old, starting in 1983, during the month of May. Since then, the group‚Äôs main rule of the game is that the last one tagged is ‚Äúit,‚Äù until next season. With Hoagie (a veterinarian,) having been the last one tagged in the previous year, he first tags Bob, now the CEO of an insurance company, by getting hired on at Bob's company as a janitor. He recruits Bob and then Chilli and Kevin for one last attempt to tag Jerry, who has never been tagged because of his strong athleticism and intelligence. Hoagie tells them that Jerry plans to retire after this year's game because of his upcoming marriage. Rebecca Crosby, a Wall Street Journal reporter doing a piece on Bob, learns of their game and joins them, deciding to write an article on the friends. They are also accompanied by Hoagie's wife Anna, who is not allowed to play as their rules state that girls weren't allowed to play, and also because she is extremely competitive. Once they arrive at their hometown of Spokane, Washington, they lure Jerry to the local country club where he will be getting married, but they are overwhelmed by Jerry's skill. Jerry then introduces his fianc√©e Susan. As the others express disappointment over not being invited to the wedding despite their close relationship, Susan explains that they were not invited because she did not want to have her wedding ruined by their tagging shenanigans. They agree to not play the game at any wedding-related events in exchange for invitations to the wedding. Despite this, the group makes several attempts to tag Jerry both before and right after wedding-related events. The group sneaks into his house at night, learning that Jerry has upped his game with various outfits and even Chloroform. Hoagie also notices a receipt for Jerry's tuxedo, learning that he will pick it up the next morning. Before they could learn anything more, they are forced to leave when Jerry sets up a convincing ruse that he is in Hoagie‚Äôs bedroom with his old stuffed bear from childhood, but in actuality, he was in his own basement the whole time. The next morning, Hoagie, knowing where Jerry will be, disguises himself as an elderly woman and ambushes Jerry at the mall, but is defeated. Then, at a rehearsal dinner at the country club, Jerry invites Cheryl Deakins, Bob and Chilli‚Äôs high school crush, to distract the group, and the attempt to tag Jerry results in a golf car chase that eventually leaves Hoagie, Chilli, and Kevin all caught in painful traps in the woods, set by Jerry and the golf grounds crew. During the rehearsal dinner, Susan reveals to the guys that she is pregnant. Defeated, the group try to build a new plan. After finding out Jerry attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, the group decide to strike his next meeting, which is on his wedding day. In preparation, they lock every exit, lay mousetraps on the ground outside to keep Jerry from jumping from windows, and dress up as members of AA. They make their move and almost tag Jerry, but once he finds himself trapped, Jerry retreats to the communion wine storage. He stays there for hours as the guys besiege the room, until Susan comes by, with the wedding just a few hours away. Susan berates Jerry and the others for risking the wedding for a childish game but suddenly appears to fall faint and have a miscarriage. Jerry comes out to help. Chilli is convinced that it is a ruse, but the situation seems authentic, and Jerry himself also tells them he is not playing around and the two leave. The guys receive texts that the wedding is postponed due to the potential miscarriage. However, a suspicious Anna sees that the bridesmaids all made similar Instagram posts. With one of the bridesmaids having a crush on Bob, and also having a private profile, Anna creates a fake profile for Bob in order to bait the bridesmaid for the truth. Once they get access, they see a post from the bridesmaid of Susan in her dress, showing that the wedding is still on schedule. Incensed by the trick, the gang decide to crash the wedding. Upon their arrival, Susan confirms the hoax, including the pregnancy being fake. Angry at Jerry for lying, Hoagie decides to tag Jerry at the end of the ceremony after the doves are released. Hoagie charges at Jerry, but narrowly misses and ends up accidentally tackling the pastor to the ground. Hoagie then loses consciousness, which Jerry thinks is a ruse, but Anna confirms that Hoagie's condition is serious and calls for an ambulance. Everyone meets up at the hospital where Hoagie tells them he has liver cancer. Knowing he may not be alive for the next season, Hoagie lied about Jerry quitting because he wanted to reunite everyone for one last attempt to tag him. Jerry laments at not being as close to the rest of the group, and states that it should have been the four of them up there as his groomsmen. At his friends and wife‚Äôs urging, Jerry finally swallows his pride and allows Hoagie to tag him. With only five minutes left the group continues the game, running around the hospital as they did as children, and change their rules so Anna, Rebecca, and Susan can play as well. Before the credits roll, multiple photographs and video clips are displayed, showing the real group of ten men that inspired the film, who continue to play to this day.

Critical reception At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, More Fast Songs About the Apocalypse received an average score of 63, based on five reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Noting that the \\"shadow of the 2016 United States presidential election looms large over the project\\", Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic wrote that Moby's \\"anger and exhaustion is palpable, so even songs about simple heartbreak and loss come packed with a gravitas borne of wider issues\\", ultimately calling the album \\"a refreshing change of pace, a frantically urgent statement that taps into the visceral with a welcome blast of noise from a voice that still has much to say.\\" Willim Nesbitt of PopMatters wrote a lukewarm review, crediting Moby for the stylistic shift explored on the album but adding that \\"like Bowie and anyone else willing to try something different, not every shot hits the target\\", concluding: \\"To some extent, it's a pastiche and collage of earlier work with its use of electronica and distorted rock/punk, but it doesn't reach the levels of the early Moby catalog that it draws from. It's neither as rough as it wants to be nor as developed as it needs to be.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits for More Fast Songs About the Apocalypse adapted from album liner notes. *Moby ‚Äì production, writing, vocals *Mindy Jones ‚Äì vocals *Gavin Lurssen ‚Äì mastering *Mark Needham ‚Äì mixing *Jonathan Nesvadba ‚Äì studio assistance, technical support *Tyler Spratt ‚Äì mixing assistance ;Artwork and design *Melissa Danis ‚Äì photography assistance *Mike Jones ‚Äì design *Jonathan Nesvadba ‚Äì photography assistance *Moby ‚Äì photography References External links  2017 albums Moby albums Mute Records albums ","title":"More Fast Songs About the Apocalypse"},{"id":"54296370","text":"Sheldrake Lake is a lake in Canada.

The Hi√©ron du Val d'Or (English: \\"Sanctuary of the Golden Valley\\") was a Catholic esoteric secret society in France, which existed from 1873 until 1926. It was founded by a Jesuit Victor Drevon and the half-Basque, half-Russian Alexis de Sarachaga... It was allied to concepts of royalism and was culturally conservative; it sought to erect a Catholic hermetic freemasonry, contrary to the ‚Äúsecular‚Äù freemasonry of the anti-clerical Grand Orient de France and was particularly devoted to Christ the King. History The group was founded in 1873 near the shrine at Paray-le-Monial, historical Burgundy, where St. Marguerite-Marie Alacoque had visions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, establishing the popular devotion. The area was popular in France as a pilgrimage destination, due to these connections. The Hi√©ron developed a museum and research center in 1877, which still exists to this day as the Mus√©e du Hi√©ron.Politica Hermetica, Les contr√©es secretes, pp 79 - 101 The building itself incorporated geometrical symbolism similar to that used within other Hermetic Christian settings. The Hi√©ron attempted to demonstrate the origins of Christianity in the mystical Atlantis, worked to prepare the way for the social political reign of Christ the King in the year 2000 and devoted themselves to the name aor-agni (\\"light-fire\\"). Following the death of de Sarachaga in 1918, Georges Gabriel de Noaillat and his wife Marthe Devuns de Noaillat stayed at Paray and continued on the work of the Hi√©ron. They sought to downplay some of the more unorthodox aspects of the Hi√©ron's mysticism and comply closer to Catholic orthodoxy. In particular, they pushed hard for the recognition of the Feast of Christ the King, which in 1925 was instituted by Pope Pius XI with the encyclical Quas primas. After the death of the de Noaillats and their collaborator Jeanne L√©pine-Authelain in 1926, the Hi√©ron essentially came to an end. However, the building itself still stands and remains to this day as a museum displaying Catholic sacred art. In 1921, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate priest Fr. F√©lix Anizan founded the Regnabit: The Universal Review of the Sacred Heart journal. This publication featured a wider array of Paray-associated Catholic writers than just Hi√©ron and was approved by the Catholic hierarchy in France. However, Georges Gabriel de Noaillat was among the first contributors to the journal. Another contributor was the historian Louis Charbonneau-Lassay who drew in the traditionalist philosopher Ren√© Gu√©non to contribute.. Originally a Martinist, Gu√©non eventually moved towards Sufism of Islam and was a key figure in the Traditionalist School. One of the collaborators of the de Naoillats; Jeanne L√©pine-Authelain; corresponded with the esotericist Paul Le Cour who displayed an interest in the Hi√©ron's claims about Atlantis. Le Cour inherited de Sarachaga's gold ring and some see him as a successor, \\"in spirit\\", at least. Le Cour would go on to become a precursor to the New Age movement, with his 1937 work The Age of Aquarius. Symbolism The Hi√©ron du Val d'Or held significance of certain images or dates such as the octopus which stood for the inconsistency of man while The Sacred Heart stands for an abyss of constancy and fidelity. Each of these symbols were identified in the Tuscan Secret Records of the Plantier (doc 6) titled \\"The Hieron of Val d'Or\\" dated February 5 or 6 and June 24.

The slogan was criticised often by opponents of May, for its perceived robotic delivery and contradictory nature, also becoming an internet meme. Origins Poster in Shoreditch, London, mocking the phrase during the election campaign According to the Financial Times, the phrase may have originated from former Prime Minister David Cameron's resignation speech after the UK voted to leave the European Union: \\"stability . . . strong, determined and committed leadership\\". David Cutts, professor of political science at the University of Birmingham, has described the phrase as an example of compressing information to provide helpful cues to voters and reduce the time needed to acquire information. Use by Theresa May and others \\"Strong and stable\\" was described as a clich√© and led to criticism that May was an ineffective political campaigner who could only talk in slogans. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, May was stopped after saying \\"strong and stable\\" in the first 30 seconds, and was asked to not use sound bites. During a Commons debate, Labour MP Paul Flynn sarcastically asked the Speaker if a microchip had been planted in Conservative MPs' heads to repeat \\"strong and stable\\" every 18 seconds. Artist Jeremy Deller designed a poster parodying the phrase and mocking the government's Brexit process. At a press conference during the election campaign, a reporter suggested that May was \\"weak and wobbly\\" rather than \\"strong and stable\\". This was repeated by other news outlets. At another point in the election campaign, a man presented opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn with two bananas, one bearing the word \\"strong\\" and the other with the word \\"stable.\\" Corbyn found the incident amusing even though the man had intended to suggest that his politics were bananas. After the election, May reportedly wanted to drop her \\"strong and stable\\" slogan because she felt it was making her look \\"stupid\\", and it was widely considered that the phrase had been overused and was becoming ever less effective. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's coordinator for Brexit- related affairs, parodied the phrase by saying \\"Any Brexit deal requires a strong and stable understanding of the complex issues involved\\". Later use The phrase was still being associated with May in 2019, the year of her resignation as prime minister.

His best known work is the novel The Melchior Elephant (2016). In May 2014 his native city of Donetsk fell under control of pro-Russian militants and he remained there. During the period of 2015‚Äì2017 Stanislav was publishing his reports (writing under the pen name Stanislav Vasin) for Mirror Weekly newspaper and other Ukrainian media, before 2 June 2017, when he disappeared. On 16 July, an agent of the DNR's ‚ÄúMinistry of State Security‚Äù confirmed that he was kidnapped by militants from so-called Donetsk People's Republic. Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, the European Federation of Journalists, Human Rights Watch, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, PEN International, Reporters Without Borders and the United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have called for his immediate release. The US Senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio have also voiced their support for Aseyev. Despite huge international support Aseyev was sentenced for 15 years and spent in isolation 962 days. He was released as part of a prison exchange and handed over to Ukrainian authorities on 29 December 2019.Journalist Stanislav Aseev returns to Ukraine within prisoner swap, 112 Ukraine (29 December 2019)  Biography  Stanislav Aseyev born in Donetsk in 1989. In 2006 he graduated from secondary school in the town of Makiivka and started courses in Institute of Informatics and Artificial Intelligence of Donetsk National Technical University. There he earned a Masters of Religious Studies with Honors in 2012. His philosophical interests include 20th-century French and German ontology. According to a biography published in Yunost magazine, after attending university Stanislav travelled to Paris, where he applied for service in the French Foreign Legion, then came back to Ukraine and tried many professions such as a loader, intern at the bank, grave digger, operator in a mailing company, and shop assistant. = Life in occupied Donetsk and disappearing = Stanislav Aseyev has stayed in Donetsk since it was captured by pro-Russian militants in 2014. He described the war in Donbass and his life under occupation in his novel and journalistic reports. His last report was for RFE/RL's project Donbass Realities, sent on June 2, 2017 (disputable if it was really written by him or, maybe, under pressure of kidnappers). His Facebook page was active for a while but probably managed by another person. Stanislav's mother (living in Makiivka near Donetsk) visited his apartment and witnessed traces of illegal enter and search there. His fellow student and former MP Yehor Firsov reported Stanislav's disappearance on June 6 blaming Russia-backed militants of kidnapping. Later this fact was commented by Security Service of Ukraine, UN Monitoring Mission on Human Rights to Ukraine, Ukraine Journalists Union. On July 16, 2017 an agent of the DNR's ‚ÄúMinistry of State Security‚Äù confirmed to Stanislav's mother that her son was in their custody and that he is suspected of \\"espionage\\". Independent media is not allowed to report from the \\"DNR\\"-controlled territory. In July 2018, Aseyev reportedly began a hunger strike while being imprisoned. In October 2019 a so- called Supreme Court of the DPR found Aseyev guilty in charges of ‚Äúorganizing an extremist community,‚Äù ‚Äúespionage and incitement to espionage,‚Äù and public actions ‚Äúaimed at violating territorial integrity‚Äù, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. #FreeAseyev an international campaign for journalist's release supported by authorities, professional communities and human rights activists was active since 2017 to 2019. Last events of the campaign were held few weeks before his release, November 15, 2019. People gathered on \\"Empty chair day\\" in Kyiv, Lviv, Kramatorsk, New York, Rome and London. Stas Aseyev and his less-known colleague Oleh Halaziuk were released (as part of a controversial prison exchange between the Donetsk People's Republic, the Luhansk People's Republic and Ukraine) and handed over to Ukrainian authorities on 29 December 2019.  Literature  The main Aseyev's work in prose is an autobiographical novel The Melchior Elephant or A man who thought. It was published for the first time in Moscow in Yunost magazine (#1 ‚Äî #6, 2015) and in the next year it came out in hardback in publishing house Kayala () in Kyiv. According to Yunost's editor Yevgeniy Malevich: ¬´his perspective is not a journalist-like, nor a writer-like but he's the young philosopher. In his novel Stanislav turns himself inside out, showing the world of a small town and the war that tore the country in half¬ª.  Journalism  Stanislav Aseyev used the pseudonym Stanislav Vasin to report from territories occupied by the Russian military and pro-Russian militants. The reason was widespread persecutions by the so-called Ministry of State Security and different militants‚Äô groups of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. Aseyev's position wasn't clearly pro-Ukrainian (he was often accused by commentators of \\"a lack of patriotism\\" or \\"immaturity of political views\\"). But his reports exposing crimes in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, war crimes of its militants, Russian activities in Donbass, and pro-Ukrainian resistance. In 2015 his reports was published by Ukrayinska Pravda. Between 2016 and 2017 he was a correspondent of Mirror Weekly, a notable Ukrainian newspaper where he published 14 articles. Also in 2016 ‚Äî 2017 he create about 50 articles and photo-reports for Radio Liberty.

The purpose of this association was primarily to bring about a more extensive acquaintance among newspaper women, so that by the frequent interchange of ideas and methods, concerted action could be brought about matters of vital public import. Discussions were not permitted of any partisan movements on the subjects of politics, religion, or reform. The members of the association took on causes related to certain public improvements in the way of roads, streets, parks, libraries, village improvement societies, free exhibits of county resources, the suppression of criminal details of sensational cases in newspapers, the suppression of criminal advertising, the development of the kindergartens ‚Äî things that tended to the building up of the country. To facilitate the work, the association issued printed monographs. Establishment Emelie Tracy Y. Swett Parkhurst Until 1890, no provision had been made on the Pacific Coast for the protection, benefit and advantage of the working newspaper woman and woman author. In other parts of the United States, these associations had been established ever since 1880, most of the earlier ones being organized for purely social purposes. After nearly three years of preliminary investigation and preparation, 150 invitations were sent out to newspaper women and authors in good standing on the Pacific Coast, asking them to meet in San Francisco, California on September 27, 1890 at the home of Emelie Tracy Y. Swett. Only 50 women came to the meeting, but everyone invited sent letters of encouragement and pledged herself to support the movement. History The Constitution and By-Laws of the New England Woman's Press Association was adopted by the PCWPA because of its simplicity. The primary purpose of the PCWPA was to improve relationships among newspaper women of the Pacific Coast, so that through the frequent interchange of ideas and methods, concerted action could be achieved ub matters concerning the public. However, discussions along the lines of any partisan movements on the subjects of politics, religion, or reform were not allowed. The first year was spent in active organization. A library of several hundred books was accumulated and catalogued, and at the close of the year the Association numbered 125 active members. The members took on causes related to public improvements in the way of roads, streets, parks, libraries, village improvement societies, free exhibits of county resources, the suppression of criminal details of sensational cases in newspapers, the suppression of criminal advertising, the development of the kindergartens ‚Äî things that tended to the building up of the country. To facilitate their work, the association issued printed monographs. The first monograph issued was on the topic of \\"Country Roads and City Streets\\", written by Mary Lynde Hoffman, a large property owner. Her essay was written from practical knowledge of existing conditions. Hoffman was also a member of the American Economic Association, and her monograph had a considerable circulation through that body. Many leading papers quoted the entire monograph, while others printed long extracts from it, fortified by vigorous editorial comment. More than 500 notices were sent to the Association concerning this essay ‚Äî a better indication of its success than personal letters could bring. In its first three years, the only source of income of the Association was that which was derived from membership and initiation fees and from contributions. In time, the association hoped to erect a building in San Francisco, the rentals of which would suffice to pay the running expenses of the Association, as well as sick benefits, when it is required. The library of the Association was a source of gratification to the members. More than 500 volumes were contributed, besides files of many of the leading dailies, weeklies, monthlies. The Association wanted first to accumulate complete sets of the published works of members, then works by Pacific Coast writers, then reference books, and finally, rare and standard books. The organization's librarian was a member of the American Library Association. Considering that the writing of the general newspaper worker was for the most part anonymous, the organization felt that its ranks do not appear at a disadvantage when compared with those of other press associations. the PCWPA's population was so scattered over a large territory, that it could not show many influential Western newspaper connections. On the other hand, the Western vigor of style had become popular, with nearly all of the writers retaining from one to a half a dozen connections with influential Eastern and English periodicals. As a member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the International League of Press Clubs and the Woman's National Press Association, the PCWPA was abreast with the spirit of organization, at the same time confident that responsible individualism was the basis of strength. The organization did not continue to exist after 1941. Executive Boards Nellie Blessing Eyster Emelie Swett Parkhurst founded the association in 1890. Nellie Blessing Eyster was unanimously elected as the first president. The original Executive Board included Jeanne Caroline Smith Carr of Pasadena, First Vice-President; Sarah Brown Ingersoll Cooper, Second Vice-President; Ella Rhoads Higginson of Whatcom, Washington, Third Vice-President; Parkhurst, Corresponding Secretary; Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis of Carson City, Nevada, Recording Secretary; Mary Olmstead Stanton, Treasurer; Isabel H. Raymond of Santa Cruz, California Auditor; and a supplementary committee consisting of Mary Camilla Foster Hall- Wood of Santa Barbara, Frances Bagby-Blades of San Diego and Andrea Hofer of Chicago.

The Executive Officers for that year, in addition to Powell, included Cooper, First Vice-President; Charlotte Perkins Stetson Gilman, Second Vice-President; Mrs. James Neall, Third Vice-President; Minna V. Gaden, Corresponding Secretary; Mary Lambert, Recording Secretary; Ella M. Sexton, Assistant Recording Secretary; Florence Percy Matheson, Treasurer; Adeline Knapp, Chairman of Program Committee additional; members, Agnes Manning and Lillian Plunkett. Notable people Active members in the first year included Caroline Severance, the first president of the first woman's club in Boston; Eliza D.

Murphy, Evelyn Ludlum, Mary Viola Lawrence (Riding Hood), Sarah Sanford, Carrie Blake Morgan, Julia P. Churchill, and Jane Martin. There was also Isabel Raymond of the Santa Cruz Surf. Of literary distinction was Josephine White Bates (d. 1934). Among the members of the Press Association engaged in editorial work were Genevieve Lucile Browne of the Californian, Louise E. Francis, editor of the Castroville Enterprise, Maggie Downing Brainard of the Pacific Tree and Vine, San Jose, California and Mrs. L. C. P. Haskins of Washington. Among those members who were regular contributors to Eastern and local journals, writing upon California subjects, were a number of Pacific Coast writers by adoption. Helen Gregory-Flesher, a regular contributor to the American Press Association, to the local press, to New York magazines and an occasional contributor to the Arena, was a Canadian by birth and education. Mary F. McRoberts, an Englishwoman, well known in political and educational circles in England, and a contributor to its press from California, was another newcomer to the Pacific Coast, though a resident of California in earlier times. Emma Russell Endres, another English woman, and correspondent to the London Times, was a Californian by her adoption of the State as her home, and a busy contributor to the English and American press. Other members whose largest contribution to the press was for Eastern publications were Carrie Wake Morgan, Alice Cary Waterman, Clara Spalding Brown, and Dorothea Lummis. Among those prominent in national fame stood Jessie Benton Fremont, who was instrumental in bringing California into the Union as a free State. She was the author of several books: \\"A Year of Travel,\\" in which she tells of the California gold discovery days; \\"A Souvenir of My Time,\\" \\"Stories of the Guard,\\" \\"A Sketch of Senator Fremont,\\" and \\"Will and Way Stories.\\" Grace Hibbard, a California poetess, was the author \\"California Violets.\\" Rose Hartwick Thorpe, author of Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight, had a note from Queen Victoria telling her that she had committed that poem to memory. Anna Morrison Reed, editor of the Northern Crown, was born in the California mines, and was a constant contributor to literature, both prose and poetry. She published one volume of verse through the Bancrofts. Lillian Hinman Shuey, was the author of \\"California Sunshine\\",\\"Among the Redwoods,\\" \\"David of Juniper Gulch,\\" \\"Don Luis' Wife,\\" and \\"The Humboldt Lily.\\" Another poetess was Mary Cameron Benjamin. Kate Douglas Wiggin was well known as a kindergarten worker and as the author of \\"The Story of Patsy,\\" \\"The Bird's Christinas Carol,\\" \\"Timothy's Quest,\\" and other books. Virna Woods gained her first literary reputation in the field of descriptive verse. In 1891 she published a drama entitled \\"The Amazons,\\" of which Gladstone wrote: \\"I admire it, both for its poetic force and Hellenic spirit.\\" She was the author of \\"Horatio,\\" which was produced by Frederick William Ward, and of \\"Lord Strathmore.\\" She died suddenly in 1902, after having achieved literary success in the dramatic field. Jeanne Caroline Smith Carr (past member of the PCWPA Executive Board), was a constant writer for the general press upon subjects concerning the promotion of the material growth of the State. She was a botanist and artist, a writer and poet, a philanthropist, a political thinker, and a home woman as well. Her name was a household word in Southern California. Mary Catherine McIntire Pacheco, a Kentucky playwright who became one of California's first published women authors, was one of the early successful writers of California. In 1875, her drama, \\"Betrayed,\\" was produced, and later another trial was made in \\"Loyal Till Death,\\" a piece which showed distinct merit and great promise. Afterwards, she produced a legitimate farce called \\"Incog,\\" which was successfully played in the important Eastern cities. Until 1875, the home of author, Frances Fuller Victor was in Portland, Oregon. After the death of her husband, who was on the ill-fated steamer Pacific when she foundered, Victor came to San Francisco and engaged in historical writing for Bancroft. In 1890, she returned to Ogden, Oregon and wrote \\"The River of the West,\\" \\"Sunset at the Mouth of the Columbia,\\" \\"All Over Oregon and Washington,\\" and many short newspaper and magazine sketches. The voice and pen of Mrs. M. G. C. Edholmes has championed every noble cause, particularly for temperance and social purity, instituted in this State. Sara Plummer Lemmon was a distinguished botanist, and with her husband, was engaged in scientific work. She received a gold medal at the World's Fair for her paintings of wild flowers of the State of California. Alice Kingsbury Cooley, who used to star it with John McCullough and with Keene, is the author of a novel, \\"Aspah,\\" and is a voluminous writer on many subjects; she is dear \\"Fanchon,\\" one of the best beloved women of the Association. Gertrude Francis Atherton, the novelist, was remembered for her keen intellect and power of analysis, making her one of the foremost writers of the day. The literary contributions of Charlotte Perkins Stetson Gilman (past PCWPA Executive Board member), were always accepted by the leading periodicals. She was a niece of Edward Everett Hale. Mary Stanton (past PCWPA Executive Board member), wrote on scientific physiognomy. Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis (past PCPWA Executive Board member), was a practical newspaper woman. Helena Modjeska, whose summer home was near Santa Ana, California, was made an honorary member, and was one of the association's greatest dramatic artists. Emily Brown Powell (past PCWPA president), contributed to the Tribune, San Francisco Call, San Francisco Call, and many other periodicals. Alice Moore McComas of Los Angeles and her daughter Alice's contributions appeared in several of the best journals. Lizzie A. Vore wrote continually for the general press and was a well known contributor to the prominent magazines of the day. Mary E. Hart (1856-1921), owner and editor of the Pacific Monthly, became a resident of Alaska, and had charge of the Alaska exhibit at the St. Louis Fair; she was a frequent contributor to the press. Anna Catherine Murphy Markham wrote short stories for the Overland Monthly, Yankee Blade, and other magazines. The philanthropist, Ada Henry Van Pelt, who was editor of the Pacific Ensign was very prominent in Red Cross work. Josephine Clifford McCracken, author of Overland Tales, was one of the early editors of the Overland Monthly. Florence Percy Matheson (past PCWPA treasurer), for many years one of the editors of the San Francisco Call, was a constant contributor to the California press. Miriam Kerns Weekes was a painter and illustrator of note. Dr. A. M. Beecher was a brilliant writer and lecturer, and a member of the famous Beecher family.

As President of the Caspar Lumber Co. and its allied interests, she was the selected representative at the St. Louis Exposition of the Forestry Department, and was prominent in the leading social, fraternal and patriotic organizations of the State. Sara E. Reamer was the first librarian and historian of the Association. Her early life in California was spent among the mines, during which she was a frequent contributor to the press on subjects of general interest. The Impress \\"The Impress,\\" originally The Bulletin, was a monthly paper and the organ of the PCWPA, was founded October 6, 1893 and published weekly. Charlotte Perkins Stetson, was the editor, Helen Stuart Campbell was the associate. Paul Tyner was the publisher. It was designed to present, from week to week, in crisp, critical paragraphs, the world's news from the Pacific coast standpoint. Questions of the day were discussed occasionally. Reviews of current literature, dramatic, artistic and musical criticism, and articles on art and education, with poetry, fiction, and humor, were among the features of the journal. While not exclusively a woman's paper, The Impress fully recognized the importance of the great movement of the century, and gave it space and attention. The PCWPA retained a page. The Women's Congress Association was also represented, as well as the Parliament of Women of Southern California, and other similar organizations. The Impress was valued as a home paper. \\"The Art of Living\\" was an important department of the journal conducted by Campbell.

In that role, she focused her attention on news and issues of Japan, North Korea, and South Korea. She has been to North Korea a dozen times.  Career  Raised in Hastings, New Zealand, Fifield got her start writing for the Rotorua Daily Post and the NZPA wire service. In 2001 at the age of 25 she headed to London and secured a job at the Financial Times, where she worked for 13 years, mainly as a foreign correspondent. She was US Political Correspondent in Washington, D.C. between 2009 and 2013, and was previously Middle East correspondent in Beirut and Tehran, and Korea Correspondent in Seoul. She was Tokyo bureau chief for The Washington Post from 2014 to 2018, and became the Beijing bureau chief. Fifield has reported from more than 20 countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya and North Korea. Over 20 years she covered the first nuclear test by North Korea in 2006, the disputed Iranian presidential election of 2009, and the 2012 US presidential election. In reporting on North Korea, she highlighted the difficulties faced by ordinary North Koreans, especially in the Kim Jong-un era. In 2017, she interviewed more than 25 recent escapees from North Korea, producing a major report that was published in both English and Korean. This was the first time The Washington Post had published in Korean.https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/north-korea- defectors/korean.html She also secured the only interview with Kim Jong-un's aunt, who had been living in the United States since 1998. She wrote about young North Korean escapees making a new life for themselves in South Korea, offering a different narrative from the usual portrayal of North Koreans as helpless victims. Fifield became the first person to ever go live on Facebook from North Korea in 2016. She covered the story of deceased University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier, who was released from imprisonment in North Korea through diplomatic efforts by the Department of State in the Trump Administration. Interviewing numerous people who have met Kim Jong-un, Fifield has sought to show through reporting that he is not a cartoon villain or a joke, but a ruthless dictator operating strategically, even if that strategy involves killing his own uncle and half-brother in order to stay in power. Fifield's book The Great Successor: The Perfectly Divine Destiny of Brilliant Comrade Kim Jong Un, was published in June 2019, and has since been translated into 24 languages. She was a Nieman Fellow in Journalism (August 2013 through May 2014) at Harvard University, where she studied how change happens in closed societies. In 2018, she was awarded the Shorenstein Journalism Award from Stanford University for excellence in reporting on Asia. \\"Fifield exemplifies how crucial it is to get the complexities of Asia right and the profound role of journalism in shaping public and decision maker approaches to our counterparts in the region,\\" the university said. After covering the coronavirus epidemic, Fifield returned to New Zealand in 2020, and in July became the editor of The Dominion Post and Stuff's Wellington newsroom, taking up her position in October 2020.

They planned to run the full season in a Toyota Tundra, and in the process, they would suspend operations for their Whelen All-American Series team. NASCAR Camping World Truck Series =Truck No. 44 History= While in search for their first series start, owner Shane Lamb acquired the owner points of the No. 44 for Martins Motorsports after round 3 of the season at Martinsville. Martins' team would be focusing on the Xfinity Series from now on. The team wanted to start racing with Donnie Levister right away with Shane Lamb listed as the owner, but NASCAR would not approve due to Levister's lack of experience. Lamb And Levister also switched back to Chevrolet after running a Toyota last season. As a result, the team hired Matt Mills to drive before Levister would be eligible. Mills competed at Kansas, Charlotte, and Dover. Mills was running at the finish in all events finishing 17th, 24th, and 17th. The team planned to enter Texas with Mills, but they later withdrew. The team had hinted that Donnie Levister would attempt to run at Gateway and future races, but Levister and Lamb parted ways after Gateway, and the team did not attempt another race. =Truck No. 62 History= In early 2016, the team announced they would run a Toyota full-time for Donnie Levister with sponsorship from Property Pro's and Shawn Magee Design. However, after not entering Daytona or Atlanta, and withdrawing from Martinsville, the team scaled back to a part-time schedule. The team initially wanted to be No. 22 but however AM Racing acquire rights of the No. 22, so they instead chose the No. 62. The team returned at the 11th race at Eldora with Levister, but they withdrew before practicing. They returned for the 20th race at Martinsville, again with Levister. After qualifying 35th out of 36 trucks, they failed to qualify. =Truck No. 74 history= At the 8th race of the 2016 season at Iowa, Faith Motorsports partnered with Mike Harmon Racing to get them higher in owner points. They ran a Chevrolet for this attempt. Mike Harmon would be listed as the owner, but they would run under the Faith Motorsports banner. Levister qualified 31st out of 33, but he didn't have enough owner points, so he failed to qualify. The partnership returned at the 13th race at Bristol with Levister in a RAM, but the team withdrew.

Established in 2005, the 11,823 acre primitive area protects a rugged and austere landscape north of Albuquerque, and is open to primitive camping, hiking, and horseback riding. Background Contiguous to the southern end of the Pueblo of Zia, the Wilderness Area was established in 2005 by Public Law 109-94, known as the ‚ÄúOjito Wilderness Act,‚Äù which both created the protected area, and also took lands within the designated area into trust for the Pueblo of Zia Indian Reservation. While the Reservation would pay for both the appraisal of the land and the land itself, the territory in question would be held in trust by the Federal government, to ensure, in the words of the law, the ability of the public to ‚Äúaccess the lands for recreational, scenic, scientific, educational, paleontological, and conservation uses.‚Äù Public Law 109-94 The wilderness Ojito Wilderness at sunset Despite its somewhat imposing and desolate appearance, the lands within Ojito Wilderness show evidence of habitation going back millions of years. Many types of fossils are found in the Jurassic- era Morrison Formation sandstone of the area, as well as large sections of petrified trees and one of the largest dinosaur skeletons ever discovered, the Seismosaurus. Evidence of human activity in the area include ruins and artifacts from prehistoric Ancient Puebloans, Spanish, and Navajo, testifying to the ability of these peoples to survive in the hot, waterless environment. Physically, the area is a dry, austere environment of multi-colored sandstone, terraces, box canyons and arroyos. Small amounts of pi√±on and juniper can be found in the Wilderness, as well as a unique stand of ponderosa pine, the lowest elevation in New Mexico where these trees can be found. Location and access Uplift in Ojito Wilderness The Ojito Wilderness is located in Sandoval County, north of Bernalillo and can be accessed via U. S. 550 and County Road 906, an unimproved road also known as the Cabezon Road. There are two marked trailheads in the area, the Seismosaurus Trailhead, and the Hoodoo Trailhead, both of which can be accessed by County Road 906. Hiking, Backpacking, horseback riding and primitive camping are allowed in the Wilderness without a permit, though the BLM is quite insistent on reminding visitors to bring in all water required. https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/new-mexico/ojito- wilderness See also *Pueblo of Zia External links *Ojito Wilderness at BLM *Ojito Wilderness at Recreation.gov *Ojito Wilderness at Wilderness.net References Wilderness Areas of New Mexico ","title":"Ojito Wilderness"},{"id":"54296921","text":"The Amai Pakpak Medical Center (APMC) is a government hospital in Marawi, Lanao del Sur, Philippines.

Pershing in a land which was then known as Marahui which became known as Camp Keihtly. In 1903, Captain James Ames organized it into a 25-bed hospital amidst a cholera outbreak which killed several US military personnel as well as locals. The health facility was later renamed as the Lanao General Hospital. It became widely known by locals by the name Public Hospital. The hospital went to the supervision of the Integrated Provincial Health Office of Lanao del Sur when the integration program of the health system of Lanao Province was launched in 1984. Lanao General Hospital then went under a renationalization through Republic Act No. 7943 which became law in 1985. Under the aforementioned law it was renamed as the Amai Pakpak Medical Center after 19th century military leader Amai Pakpak who is regarded as a hero by the Maranaos.

He specialized in construction while his brother Horatio did the design work (a third brother, Robert, was a landscape architect associated with the firm, but not as a partner). Buildings designed by J. Williams Beal, Sons included the Granite Trust Company building, Bethany Congregational Church, Plymouth County Hospital, Repertory Theatre of Boston (now the Boston University Theatre), the Plymouth County Courthouse in Brockton, the Hyannis Town Office, Peoples National Bank of Marlboro, and a number of school buildings. Public life =Town of Hanover= Beal co-founded the No. 2 fire company of Hanover. After a few years the company was turned over to the town. During World War I he served as the town's food administrator. He later worked on an effort to bring public water to the town and served as a member of the Hanover water commission. = Massachusetts Republican Party= Beal got involved with the Massachusetts Republican Party through his friendships with Leverett Saltonstall and John Richardson. In 1936, Beal was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. That same year he also ran for a seat in the Massachusetts Senate and served as president of the Plymouth County Republican Club. In 1938 he worked for Saltonstall's gubernatorial campaign. =Commissioner of Public Works= In 1939, Governor Saltonstall removed Commissioner of Public Works William F. Callahan from office and offered Beal the job. According to Beal, he turned down the job because he did not want to give up his business, however Saltonstall submitted his name to the Massachusetts Governor's Council anyway and accepted the job. Beal's term expired on November 30, 1940 and he announced that he would not accept reappointment. Bribery conviction On March 5, 1942, John W. and Horatio Beal were indicted on charges of conspiring to give bribes to Cambridge, Massachusetts Mayor John W. Lyons, who in 1938 awarded J. Williams Beal, Sons a contract to design the Cambridge Tuberculosis Hospital. John W. Beal was also charged with 12 counts of giving the bribes to Lyons, as well as two counts of perjury (one for lying to a grand jury investigating the city of Cambridge's building program and one for lying during the trial of Lyons and his codefendant Paul Mannos). Anthony Spinelli, the contractor for the hospital project, was also indicted. On May 26, 1942, the Beals and Spinelli were found guilty conspiracy to commit bribery and John W. Beal was found guilty of 10 counts of bribery. John W. Beal was sentenced to a year in jail. He was paroled on January 5, 1944. Later life and death After Horatio's death in 1964, Beal managed J. Williams Beal, Sons with H. Story Granger and Edward A. J. Poskus. He was active in the firm until his death on December 3, 1971.

The flat- bottomed barges with a shallow draught and leeboards, were perfectly adapted to the Thames Estuary, with its shallow waters and narrow tributary rivers. The larger barges were seaworthy vessels, and were the largest sailing vessel to be handled by just two men. The average size was about 120 tons and they carried of canvas sail in six working sails. The mainsail was loose-footed and set up with a sprit, and was brailed to the mast when not needed. It is sheeted to a horse, as are the foresails so need no attention when going about. The topsail was the main working sail in heavy weather, the upper reaches of the rivers and constricted harbours. It is controlled from the deck by halliards, in-hauls and sheets. The mizzen boom is sheeted down to the rudder- assisting the helm. The masts are mounted in tabernacles so they can be lowered to shoot bridges with little loss of headway. The bowsprit where fitted could be 'topped' where space was limited.

It grows in higher areas between Eungella and the Blackdown Tableland National Park. Description Pterostylis anatona is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a rosette of dark green, wrinkled leaves long and wide. A single light green and white flower long and wide with a reddish-brown tip is borne on a spike high. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal is slightly shorter than the petals. There is a wide gap between the galea and the lateral sepals. The lateral sepals are erect and have narrow tips long and a bulging V-shaped sinus between them. The labellum is long, about wide, reddish-brown and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from June to August. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis anatona was first formally described in 1997 by David Jones and the description was published in The Orchadian from a specimen collected near Eungella.

Early years and education Penelope Ann Margaret Blessing was born in Frederick, Maryland, December 7, 1836. Her parents were Abraham and Mary M. E. Blessing. Her ancestry included Huguenot and Anglo- Saxon background. On the maternal side, she was a granddaughter of Captain George W. Ent, a commander at Fort McHenry in the war of 1812 and a friend of Francis Scott Key. On the same side, she was related to Barbara Frietchie. Abraham Blessing, Eyster's father, who died when she was 10 years old, was the youngest brother of George Blessing of Maryland, who served during the American Civil War, and was known as, \\"The Hero of the Highlands.\\" The mother had poetic taste, and was a devout Christian. The eldest of the five children, Nellie, baptized Penelope, showed early promise of literary ability. She was educated by private tutors and at Barleywood Seminary, Virginia. Career Eyster's first work was assisting with the purchase of Mt. Vernon, and she was active in the Sanitary Commission during the American Civil War. She became a newspaper correspondent and wrote reminiscences of the war and its notable people for Harper's Magazine. She wrote for California journals, including stories for the Overland and Illustrated Californian. She was associated with Gail Hamilton in the editing of Wood's Magazine, and was also the editor of The Pacific Ensign, the organ of the State WCTU. Eyster wrote the \\"Sunny Hour Series\\", and after moving to San Jose, California, she wrote \\"A Colonial Boy\\" for children in 1890. She helped in the education of Chinese residents in California; her work, \\"A Chinese Quaker\\", attracted wide attention in Europe and the Orient.

They had one daughter, Mary, born a year after the marriage, and one son, who died at the age of 10, in 1872. David was employed as a financial clerk of the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. The death of the son and her mother the following year caused Eyster's health to fail. In 1876, the family moved from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to San Jose, California, which helped Eyster rally from her depression and regain interest in religious and benevolent work. In Pennsylvania, the family had been members of the English Lutheran Church, but in San Jose, they became connected with the Presbyterian denomination, and Eyster was linked with some of its enterprises. In 1900, after the death of the husband, Eyster moved to San Francisco to live with her daughter, Mary A. Elder. Her grandson, Paul Elder, became a San Francisco publisher and bookseller.

History Cusack served as a gunner and sailor on several ships but his attempts at mutiny landed him in Marshalsea prison for a time. On his release in 1668 he traveled to Cadiz and signed aboard the Hopewell out of Tangier as a gunner. He and several associates mutinied and seized the ship, setting the officers adrift in a rowboat. They renamed the vessel Valiant Prince and had a forced merchant draw up false papers for it. Cusack also had Articles written out which he had his crew swear to, generally referred to as his \\"Obligations.\\" He threw out the previous captain's papers to avoid incriminating himself in piracy. He even threw out the ship's Bible; as the captured merchant Thomas Power recalled, Cusack ‚Äúcould not be perswaded to save a great large Bible that constantly lay upon the great Cabbin Table, from the mercy of the Waves, which whiles some of his own Crew endeavoured to perswade him to, he replyed, ‚ÄòYou Cowards, what do you think to go to Heaven and do such Actions as these? No, I will make you Officers in Hell under me‚Äô; and with that threw the Bible out at the great Cabbin window, saying ‚ÄòGo thou thy way Divinity, what have we to do with thee?‚Äô‚Äù They sailed to the Leeward Islands and tried to take several small vessels but soon were captured while ashore, ending up imprisoned in Barbados. They escaped and captured a 250-ton 28-gun frigate they named Flying Devil, which they sailed up the East Coast of the United States before abandoning it and sailing back to England aboard smaller boats. Cusack then served as a privateer for the Kingdom of England during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, taking several Dutch prizes. When those conflicts ended in 1674 he falsely obtained a French commission to hunt Spanish and Dutch ships. He kept a small crew, forcing sailors to serve as needed, including his surgeon Jacob Marrelly. With only 23 men he took a cargo ship leaving Norway, a 500-ton vessel called Saint Anne out of London under Captain Shorter. Cusack and his pirates put the ship's crew aboard a pink they had taken earlier as a prize, leaving them no gear or provisions, and set them adrift. They put into Aberdeen to sell the Saint Anne, claiming it was a Dutch ship they had found abandoned, and hid its paperwork to conceal their crime. Unfortunately for Cusack the crew they had set adrift was picked up by a passing merchantman and returned to Norfolk. They spread news of Cusack's piracy and the Saint Anne was seized. Cusack and his men heard of this and avoided Aberdeen, sailing up the Thames to Lee to clean their ship. They spent their booty in local towns, who were glad to have the money, but which gave away their presence. They were pursued by local marshals and two armed vessels under Colonel Kennedy, who captured them and delivered Cusack back to Marshalsea prison with his crew. Cusack claimed to the Admiralty court that he had a commission, and when challenged tried to explain that his invalid commission was a mistake. The Court noted that valid or not, no commission would have allowed him to rob an English vessel, and he was convicted. He was executed on January 18, 1675 with thirteen of his crew, the rest acquitted for having been forced into piracy. Obligations Cusack's pirate code, or Articles, are one of the very few pirate articles preserved from the 17th and 18th centuries, and one of only two complete sets from the 17th century (the other belonging to Nicholas Clough).
