She worked extensively on the programming language ALGOL 68 and the Royal Radar Establishment Automatic Computer (RREAC), an early solid-state electronics, ICL 1907F computer.  Early life  Bond was born in 1942 and grew up in Dagenham, Essex, in the UK. Both her parents were teachers, and she was an only child. She studied at Bristol University from 1962 to 1965, where she studied mathematics and science and received first-class honours.  Career and research  After graduating from Bristol, Bond was interested in working in applied mathematics, although she didn't have computer training before then. She applied to and joined the Mathematics Division of the RRE in 1965; she was hired by British mathematician and engineer Philip Woodward. Her work mostly consisted of writing operating systems and compilers, not \\"numerical\\" computing. At the start of her career, Bond was the only female scientific officer with a graduate education at RRE.\\"I don‚Äôt recall any other women Scientific Officers; there certainly weren‚Äôt any working closely with me, until about three or four years later.\\", \\"Susan Bond: An Interview Conducted by Janet Abbate for the IEEE History Center\\". Bond later learned that her supervisor Woodward had been, as historian Janet Abbate describes, \\"'actively recruiting women' as an affordable source of high-quality researchers\\". One of her first projects was reimplementing Syntax Improving Device (SID), a compiler-compiler tool developed by fellow RRE employee Michael Foster, to generate compilers for high-level programming languages. Afterward, she worked with Ian Currie on CORAL 64, a high-level language for embedded system computers. = Implementing ALGOL 68 = The RRE had originally used ALGOL 60 for the RREAC from its initial development in 1963. After the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) published the specifications for the more powerful ALGOL 68 in 1968, RRE attempted to adapt it for use on the RREAC. Bond worked with John Morison and Ian Currie on ALGOL 68-R, the first compiler implementation of ALGOL 68, and they announced its creation at the 20‚Äì24 July 1970 IFIP Working Conference on ALGOL 68 Implementation in Munich. Their ALGOL 68-R was an adaptation of the ALGOL 60 compiler they had built for RREAC. The team that worked on ALGOL 68-R intended for the language to become the RRE's primary programming language, which could be used for scientific programming as well as business administration tasks like payroll and taking inventory. After the publication of the ALGOL 68-R specifications, Bond and Woodward published a narrative guide to ALGOL 68, titled \\"ALGOL 68-R User‚Äôs Guide\\" through HM Stationery Office. The initial 17,000 copy run sold out. Bond effectively provided ongoing support for the compiler: readers would contact her whenever they had trouble implementing it. Bond and Woodward continued to update and publish new versions of their guide for the RRE's later implementations of ALGOL, such as ALGOL 68RS. One reviewer, Richard Shreeve, contested that while their 1983 title Guide to ALGOL 68 for Users of RS Systems was an \\"excellent reference text\\", it gives \\"insufficient help to the beginner or newcomer to ALGOL 68\\". = Promotion to superintendent = In 1976, the RRE merged with several other research institutions into a renamed Royal Signals and Radar Establishment. In 1980, Bond was promoted to Superintendent of Computing and Software Research there. As part of her role, Bond collaborated with the Open Software Foundation on the Architecture Neutral Distribution Format, and on computing policy for the UK Ministry of Defense. Bond retired from work in 1993.  Personal life  Bond met her husband, Chris Sennett, while working at the RRE.

When blood smears and bone marrow preparations from patients with Alder‚ÄìReilly anomaly are stained and examined microscopically, large, coarse granules may be seen in their neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. The condition may be mistaken for toxic granulation, a type of abnormal granulation in neutrophils that occurs transiently in inflammatory conditions. In addition to mucopolysaccharidosis, Alder‚ÄìReilly anomaly may occur in lipofuscinosis and Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. While the anomaly is generally considered to exhibit autosomal recessive inheritance, it may also occur in carriers who are heterozygous for the Tay‚ÄìSachs mutation, although the inclusions are much less frequent than in homozygotes. Alder‚ÄìReilly anomaly is not diagnostic of any disorder and does not correlate with disease severity. Affected white blood cells function normally. Alder‚ÄìReilly inclusions stain appear violet when treated with Wright‚ÄìGiemsa stain and, in mucopolysaccharidosis, stain metachromatically with toluidine blue.

Forester wrote about his fictional character Horatio Hornblower, when he was in command of HMS Sutherland. In the story the Sutherland rescues naked and emaciated Frenchmen from a makeshift raft. The men had been prisoners of war who had been confined to the deserted island of Cabrera. In Forester's story, Cabrera was deserted because it had no ports, and no foliage. Spanish authorities had landed 20,000 French prisoners on the island. Because there were no ports Spanish authorities left the prisoners unguarded, and the only care they provided were food shipments. But the food they supplied was insufficient for the number of prisoners, and bad weather could prevent the landing of the food for weeks at a time. Spanish authorities weren't providing any clothing or blankets to the prisoners, and, after two years confinement, all of their clothes had worn out. The prisoners tell Hornblower some of the more desperate men have resorted to cannibalism. When Hornblower approaches the island he sees that the Spanish victualing ship has given up on trying to land food, because the wind is in the wrong quarter for a landing on the island's single beach. Through his superior seamanship Hornblower is able to shoot a line to the prisoners, and use it to let them tow to shore a casks of food from his own ship's stores. Cabrera is a real island, and Spanish authorities did confine French prisoners there. Over 10,000 French prisoners were confined on the Island, in 1808. In 1814, when the war was over, only 3,700 were left to be repatriated. References Category:1941 short stories Category:Short stories by C. S.

One English language source describes him as \\"an 'official' - although radically anti-academic - intellectual\\". He was made Artistic Director at Cines Studios, Italy's leading film company, in 1931, remaining in the post for slightly more than a year. He also directed two short documentaries in the late 1940s.Nicoli p.122  Biography  = Provenance and early years = Emilio Cecchi was born in Florence, second of the six recorded children of Cesare and Marianna Sani Cecchi. The family had their home in the city center among the narrow streets between the Porta San Gallo and the cathedral, but Cesare Cecchi came originally from the countryside: he worked in an Ironmonger's store. Emilio's mother, like many Florentines, had her own little tailoring workshop. The family was close-knit and loving, but Cecchi would nevertheless look back later on a childhood scarred by tragedy. Annunziata, his elder sister, was seriously ill over many years and died of tuberculosis in 1902. His father was devastated by the experience. Emilio Cecchi later wrote of how, when his father left his work, they would meet up and walk to the church where for long hours they would kneel together side by side working through their grief and - at least in the case of the boy - studying the detail of building's elaborate interior architecture. Cecchi attended the middle school run by the Piarists, receiving his school diploma in 1894. That opened the way for him to move on to technical school, and from there to the technical-commercial institute, from where in 1901 he emerged with a diploma in book-keeping and accountancy. It was an unusual achievement for one from a relatively impoverished background and he was rewarded by being sent to take a holiday with an uncle of his father's who lived at San Quirico d'Orcia, a hill-town on the far side of the neighbouring Province of Siena. He had already embarked on a serious attempt to teach himself how to paint when he was just twelve, and he was now inspired by the Senese countryside to resume his artistic studies through both practical endeavour and reading. Back in Florence he became a regular presence in the Gabinetto Vieusseux (library) where his energetic autodidacticism was again to the fore. He discovered the works of Gabriele D'Annunzio, a dominating presence in early twentieth century literature. He also ingested parts of the multi-volume compendium \\"la Storia della pittura in Italia\\" (\\"The History of Painting in Italy\\"), by Cavalcaselle and Crowe. He made sketches of a number of pictures that particularly interested him and took the opportunity to make the acquaintance of Giani Stuparich and Diego Garoglio, who were teachers of Giovanni Papini, and who provided him with advice on his further reading. (Garoglio recommended Baudelaire and Poe.) These, along with Vittorio Scialoja whom he met at around the same time, exercised a significant influence on his early development as a scholar of the visual arts. During 1901/02 he undertook a period of military service, which he was able to do while continuing to be based in Florence. In 1902 he took a job with the Credito Italiano (bank). From there he moved on, in 1904, to a job as a copyist in the offices of the city hospital. Whenever he was not working, night and day, he was studying the visual arts. As a critic he would later gain a particular reputation for his expertise on the Senese School and the Florentine \\"Quattrocento\\", both topics on which in due course he would publish insightful books of reference. A milestone came when he received classics diploma from the prestigious \\"Convitto nazionale statale Francesco Cicognini\\" educational institution in Prato. = Networking = Although Cecchi's progression from humble beginnings to nationally respected literary and arts scholar reflected his own remarkable talent, energy and determination, it was also a tribute to Florence, which during the early years of the twentieth century was among the most open and intellectually lively cities in Italy. He was appreciative of this, even though he continued to be dogged by family tragedy. In 1903 his brother Guido fell ill with the Tuberculosis that had killed their sister, while Emilio himself was also suffering from bouts of serious illness. Guido died in 1905. Still in 1903, Emilio Cecchi and the polymath writer-philosopher Giovanni Papini became friends. Another new friend that year was the painter and ceramicist Armando Spadini. Cecchi connected with a circle of students from the \\"Florence Institute of Higher Studies\\" (\\"Istituto di Studi Superiori\\") which also included Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, Giuseppe Prezzolini and Ardengo Soffici. With friends such as these, it is not entirely surprising that in 1903 Emilio Cecchi made what some regard as his own critical debut, with an article entitled \\"Il concerto\\", which appeared under the pseudonym \\"Aymerillot\\" in the review magazine Leonardo. = Columnist = In 1906 Cecchi finally left Florence and relocated to Rome. He wrote for various Roman literary publications including, notably, Athena and Nuova Antologia. At this stage his stay in Rome was relatively brief, however, since he decided to study for a further academic qualification. Having studied \\"as a privateer\\" for his classics diploma from the \\"Convitto nazionale statale Francesco Cicognini\\", he was able to enrol at the Literature Faculty of the \\"Istituto di Studi Superiori\\". His student career provided an opportunity for more networking. New friends included Scipio Slataper and the northerner Carlo Michelstaedter. Another contemporary was Giuseppe De Robertis. Cecchi did not pursue his studies to the point of graduation (although an Honorary degree which the institute conferred on him in 1958 may have implied a reassuring measure of retrospective recognition). Meanwhile he continued to engage as a literary critic, at times focusing as much on Russian, German or English literature as on Italian. = Marriage and family = In 1910 or 1911 Emilio Cecchi married Leonetta Pieraccini (1882 - 1977), an artist and the daughter of a physician from Poggibonsi a little town set in the wine country approximately midway between Florence and Siena. However, the couple now made their home not in Tuscany but back in Rome. The marriage would be followed by the births of their four children in 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1918. (Their eldest child, a son, died in infancy, however.) The critic-translator, Masolino D'Amico (born 1939), is Emilio Cecchi's grandson. = In Rome = Back in Rome he contributed assiduously to \\"Tribuna\\", a daily newspaper published between 1883 and 1946. He also time to work for rival publications, of which probably the most significant, at least initially, was the weekly literary magazine La Voce. However, he increasingly found himself in opposition to editorial decisions by the La Voce under its editor in chief, his fellow Florentine Giuseppe De Robertis. Cecchi's article \\"False audacie\\" appeared in \\"Tribuna\\" on 13 February 1915. It robustly criticised Papini's \\"Cento pagine di poesia\\" (\\"A hundred pages of poetry\\") and triggered a similarly robust reaction from Papini in La Voce on 28 February 1915. Further back and forth exchanges between the two, published respectively in \\"Tribuna\\" and \\"Voce\\", followed, and other literary commentators joined the fray. However, as 1915 progressed, larger political developments intervened. Although using \\"Tribuna\\" for his feuding with antagonists in the literary journals was no doubt an effective way to raise his profile among Rome's intellectuals, it was not necessarily Cecchi's most important work during this period. His circle also included erudite scholars such as Roberto Longhi and Grazia Deledda. His 1912 essay on the work of Giovanni Pascoli is regarded as one of his best, containing insights as valid today as when it first appeared. Over the next two or three years he concentrated principally on English and Irish literature, producing several significant translations. Swinburne and Meredith were particular favourites. Nevertheless, he certainly did not avoid Italian poetry. He was an enthusiastic admirer of Dino Campana, \\"the best poet we have\\". = War years = In 1914 the Italian government had resisted participation in the First World War. Major belligerent powers on both sides were keen to reverse that decision. Italy's territorial aspirations were no secret, and in April 1915, sufficient inducements having been secured from the British, the Italian government agreed (at that stage secretly ) to join in with the fighting on the British side: Italy formally declared war on Austria the next month, by which time, despite a widespread conviction that the country was not well prepared for such a venture, large scale military mobilisation was already underway. On 10 May 1915 Cecchi was mobilised and sent to join thousands of others in the newly enlarged army. He gave careful thought to the question of which newspapers or journals should benefit from his written reports, but evidently decided to stay faithful: on 28 June 1915 it was \\"Tribuna\\" that printed the first in a succession of reports by Emilio Cecci from the Austrian front. Meanwhile his \\"History of nineteenth century English literature\\" (\\"Storia della letteratura inglese nel secolo XIX\\") on which in one way and another he had been working since at least as far back as 1903, was published in Milan. The study of English-language literature was a theme to which he would return regularly through the ensuing decades. Despite the formidable energy he devoted to networking, it was only on 15 December 1915, while in Rome on leave from the frontline, that Cecchi had his first meeting with the man whose poetry he had eulogised in print, Dino Campana. In September 1916 he was assigned to the commissariat of the 8th Army Corps. This involved a posting to his home city of Florence. His wife and small children also relocated back to Florence from Rome. In Florence his military duties seem to have left him with sufficient time and opportunity to embrace family life and attend to his reading. He even passed some exams at the university during this period. In September 1917, however, he was promoted to the rank of captain, and posted to the defensive \\"Line of the Seven Communes\\" on the northern front. Cecchi's letters of the time indicate that his 1917 transfer to the frontline was unexpected and unwelcome. During 1918 Cecchi was a contributor to Piero Jahier's so-called trench newspaper, \\"L'Astico\\" (which took its name from a mountain river in the fighting zone). Many of Cecchi's wartime letters, providing an excellent source for researchers. Along with Jahier, those with whom he was in contact through these years included Michele Cascella, Riccardo Bacchelli, Benedetto Croce (who valued his contributions to his magazine \\"La Critica\\") and Gaetano Salvemini. =Aftermath of war= On 13 November 1918 Cecchi arrived in London, sent by Olindo Malagodi to work as a correspondent for \\"Tribuna\\". His mandate included some news reporting. Till now, Cecchi's relationship with journalism had been uneven. He had been inclined to treat newspaper work as a distraction from serious scholarship, but it was a distraction that was frequently necessary to put food on the table. The opportunities presented by the chance to travel to London generated a more enthusiastic reaction, however. He made good use of the opportunities. In England he visited Chesterton at the latter's home in Beaconsfield. He later helped promote Chesterton's work to Italian readers: his contribution included translating some of the texts into Italian. Another of England's literary celebrities whom he met during his stay in England, whose writing he would translate and champion after his return to Italy in 1919, was Hilaire Belloc. During his months in England Cecchi agreed an arrangement with the Manchester Guardian and Observer, two nationally distributed English newspapers of the political centre-left. He became a regular correspondent for the Guardian from Italy between 1919 and June 1925. His contributions, most of which were submitted in Italian and then translated by newspaper staff in England, generally appeared without attribution. = La Ronda = During 1919 the Cecchi's moved back from Florence to Rome, where Cecchi was one of the (apparently self-identified) \\"seven wise men\\" who co-founded and then co- produced La Ronda, a literary magazine published in Rome four times a year between 1919 and 1923. The other six were Riccardo Bacchelli, Antonio Baldini, Bruno Barilli, Vincenzo Cardarelli, Lorenzo Montano and A. E. Saffi. The slaughter of war had triggered a widespread retreat from the wilder optimism of the modernists. The \\"wise\\" (and in several cases strikingly young) men who created La Ronda were engaged in a mission to return to older literary traditions, following the excesses of the Avant-garde. Indeed, during the first half of 1919 Cecchi contributed a thoughtful piece entitled \\"Ritorno all'ordine\\" (loosely if inadequately translated, \\"Return to order\\"). Of the seven \\"seven wise men\\", it was Vincenzo Cardarelli who most unambiguously sought to set the tone for La Ronda. Cardarelli was a cautious man whose instincts led him to defend traditional principals and conservative values. Cecchi was also by temperament a cautious and conservative man, but he was also driven by intellectual rigour which was reflected in a determination to apply a scholarly and evidence-driven approach in his articles. The post-war period was a time of change and uncertainty. Cecchi felt that intellectuals - especially intellectuals with access to the power of the published word - a strong duty to acknowledge and participate in the developments in public life, and not simply to deny the nuances in the shifting realities of the age. The result was that during La Ronda's four year life the differences in perspective between the principal contributors to it were increasingly apparent to readers. More important than the philosophical tensions and contradictions between the contributors to La Ronda was the fact that some of Italy's best young literary commentators had the freedom to follow their own intellectual paths, which especially in the case of Cecchi meant satisfying the constant desire for enquiry and research. This quickly came to be expressed in a remarkable degree of mutual respect and tolerance between the seven \\"Ronda\\" founders, irrespective of sometimes strong differences in underlying assumptions. Cecchi contributed a number of essays and reviews on English and American authors in which he demonstrated a new level of structure and clarity. The subjects chosen and the Elzeviro layout in which they appeared conferred additional authority on his written contributions. He continued to expand his own horizons by discovering new authors such as Carlo Cattaneo along with new works by authors whom he already knew well, such as Chesterton. (His first translation into Italian of Manalive / \\"Le avventure di un uomo vivo\\" dates from this period.) Despite earlier difficulties with its former editor, Cecchi still made contributions to La Voce. At Voce, however, he was well down the informal hierarchical structure, regarded as a young and raw talent at Voce, where internal politics were often conflictual. At Ronda Cecchi was able to contribute almost entirely on his own terms: in the process he acquired and demonstrated a well-rounded and well defined voice that was very obviously his own. = Pesci rossi = The years 1919 and 1920 were intensely busy one for Cecchi. 1920 saw the publication of his book \\"Pesci rossi\\" (loosely, \\"Gold fishes\\") which some see as the most important and characteristic of his books. It was the only volume he published to which he did not return for a partial re-arrangement or rewrite in later years. \\"Pesci rossi\\" consists of seventeen beautifully crafted prose pieces (actually eighteen, since one in a merger of two originally separate essays) produced by Cecchi between 1916 and 1919. All except one had previously appeared in \\"Tribuna\\" or \\"Ronda\\". The topics are diverse: public and private events, sometimes seemingly inconsequential, things read, people met, personal memories, observations of nature concerning plants or animals. There is a sense in which the book represents the launch by Cecchi of an entire new genre that will stand out as representative of Italy's literary panorama between the twentieth century world wars. The approach works best where the critic Cecchi controls the author Cecchi, and the quality of the prose is a function of the constructive tension between the two. The outcome is a sort of supervised lyricism, and an element of insouciance hinting at detachment. There is nevertheless a balancing wit, cloaked in shrewd insight and frequent flashes of incisive humour. The simple power and beauty of Emilio Cecchi's writing style are themes to which sources return again and again. = 1920s = The interwar period coincided with the peak of Cecchi's career as a literary critic and authority. His writing style triggered discussion among contemporaries, with which he himself was willing to engage. There was a widespread belief at the time that writing for newspapers would be damaging to the prose style of practitioners. Cecchi fought, with his pen, to defeat this prejudice, using nothing more deadly than the careful precision and euphony of his own writerly artistry. In 1920 he began contributing to Valori plastici, a recently launched fortnightly magazine with a focus on the arts and the fashionable \\"Return to order\\" agenda. Cecchi was now pursuing two parallel but closely intertwined careers as both a literary critic and an arts critic. Between 15 July 1921 and 30 November 1923 he was contributing a weekly column to \\"Tribuna\\", in a section entitled \\"Libri nuovi e usati\\" (\\"Books new and second-hand\\": The title was later recycled and used for a volume of Cecchi essays published in 1958.) Authorship of the Tribuna column was attributed by means of the pseudonym \\"Il Tarlo\\" (\\"The bookworm\\"). The regular column gained for Cecchi growing and widespread respect, as he transitioned from the status of \\"another critic\\" to that of a cultural and literary authority. Between December 1923 and the end of 1927 he was writing regularly for La Stampa, a nationally distributed and respected daily newspaper published in Turin. In 1924 he also became a staff member at Il Secolo, a daily national newspaper based in Milan, to which he contributed as literary critic, filling the shoes of the highly respected Enrico Thovez as the latter fell terminally ill. In 1922 Cecchi, like other journalists, found himself reporting la \\"conquista del potere da parte di Mussolini\\" (the \\"conquest of power on the part of Mussolini). For writers of Cecchi's generation, attitudes to the Mussolini government would be endlessly discussed by subsequent generations of scholars. Characteristically, Cecchi's reactions to \\"the leader\\" were undogmatic, nuanced and at times, frustratingly for some, apparently fluid. Both from his published contributions to literary criticism and from the many notebooks in which he collected his thoughts, it is possible to detected an attitude of \\"dignified liberal detachment\\" during the early years of Fascism. It was an attitude widely shared among European intellectuals of the time. In 1925, as Mussolini's polarising tendencies had their effect, Cecchi was among those who added his signature to Benedetto Croce's Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals, a somewhat reactive - and in the context of subsequent events cautious - document which nevertheless represented a reproach to the populist enthusiasm that had carried the Fascists to power. It is worth bearing in mind that the \\"manifesto\\" to which Cecchi added his signature was produced less than a year after the murder of Giacomo Matteotti by fascist thugs had served notice that the relaxed attitude to the more unsavoury aspects of Fascism that had hitherto been mainstream among Italian intellectuals was perhaps not the easy option it might once have seemed. By 1935, however, the passage of time and events in Germany had to some extent \\"normalised\\" Fascist government. That year Cecchi, entrapped according to one sympathetic source by the seductive lure of political power, agreed to accept the Mussolini prize for literature, which he was awarded the next year.A. Spinosa: Mussolini. Il fascino di un dittatore, Mondadori, Milano, 1989, p. 153 In the eyes of post-1945 critics Cecchi's political credibility was further compromised in July 1940, less than a month before, following much anguished speculation, the government implemented a controversial decision to engage militarily in the Second World War, when he joined the Royal Academy, widely seen by this time as a tool of government. In 1927 he joined the \\"Corriere della Sera\\", a Genoa-based mainstream national newspaper to which he would contribute regularly (though not entirely without interruption) for the next forty years. He also teamed up in 1927 with his old friend Roberto Longhi, becoming co-editor of \\"Vita Artistica\\". Several sources mention the delight that Cecchi took in international travel, notably to Great Britain and the Netherlands. He travelled further in 1930 when he accepted an invitation to spend a year in California as \\"Chair of Italian Culture\\" and teach at Berkeley. He was able to explore the cultural life San Francisco in some depth and also, before returning to Europe, satisfy a \\"longstanding desire\\" to get to know Mexico. Naturally he shared his experiences and impressions with readers of the Corriere della Sera and - mostly posthumously - with scholars accessing his copious legacy of well-filled notebooks. = 1930s = During the 1930s Emilio Cecchi produced several volumes that libraries and book shops tend to classify as \\"travel literature\\". Other biographers insist that these are better understood as books of essays, following the pattern set by \\"Pesci rossi\\" (1920), which just happen to be concerned with his travels. Perhaps the most successful of these is \\"Messico\\" (\\"Mexico\\"), a compilation of some of the best essays submitted to Corriere della Sera during his time in north and central America. In it he shares his fascination with the remote and shadowy civilisation that once existed in Mexico. Less satisfactory is his book \\"Et in Arcadia\\" (1936), based on a lengthy visit through Greece in 1934: the book echoes the well-trodden tourist trail which many of his wealthier readers might already have worked through for themselves. A third \\"travel book\\", entitled \\"America amara\\" (1939) reproduced more of the articles he had provided to Corriere della Sera during his American year in 1930/31, and complemented these with further essays based on a subsequent visit to the American west coast undertaken by Cecchi during 1937/38. For Cecchi the 1930s were a decade of intense professional activity, extending far beyond the publication of his \\"travel literature\\". He contributed extensively to regional arts and cultural magazines in the Ugo Ojetti stable, such as Dedalo (Milan), Pegaso (Florence) and Pan (Milan), with a particular focus on the modern American classics. \\"Scrittori inglesi e americani\\" (\\"English and American writers\\"), published in 1935 brought together a number of essays relating to the same themes. In the first edition English authors predominated, but in subsequent versions there were more American writers, reflecting Cecchi's discoveries in American literature during and following his year in California. In 1942 Cecchi used his literary celebrity to endorse the publication of \\"Americana\\", a compilation from contemporary American \\"narratori\\" (loosely, \\"story tellers\\") that had been put together by Elio Vittorini, an outspoken Milanese critic of Mussolini. The book had been blocked by Fascist censors in 1941. Cecchi adapted the book to the political and military situation of the times by substituting for Vittorini's original an introduction denouncing the \\"letteratura impegnata\\" (loosely, \\"politicised literature\\") and \\"democracy\\" of the United States. After an abrupt change in Italian politics in 1943 Cecchi would insist that the commitment implicit in his more political actions under the polarising Fascist r√©gime had reflected his strong Italian patriotism rather than any sort of political endorsement of the Fascist government. Later biographers, while admiring of his scholarly abilities and energies, and in personal terms sympathetic, have nevertheless felt it necessary to adopt an apologetic tone in respect of what many would construe as Cecchi's political misjudgements during the closing chapters of the Mussolini era. During the 1930s and early 1940 Cecchi also worked closely with Giovanni Gentile on the \\"Enciclopedia Italiana\\" contributing, in particular, numerous entries on the arts and literature to Appendix II (1939-1948) of it. =1940s= Admission in May 1940 to the Royal Academy no doubt reflected the skill and energy Cecchi was devoting his work in promoting and sustaining Italy's cultural and artistic heritage, though the fact that he was at the time working closely on the encyclopaedia project with Gentile, a philosophical mentor of Italian Fascism, may also have played its part. During the Second World War Cecchi continued to live in Rome with his family. Travel was not easy, but in 1942 he nevertheless managed a trip to Switzerland in order to attend the wedding of his daughter \\"Suso\\" to the musicologist (and painter) Fedele D'Amico. = Cinema = In 1932 Ludovico Toeplitz of Cines appointed Emilio Cecchi to the position of artistic director at the company's new Rome studios. Cecchi had only recently returned from a year in California, where he had seized the opportunity to study at close hand the latest developments in Hollywood. He had been using his newspaper columns in Italy to write about the cinema, recognising the potential of the new art-form, and commending in particular the work of the young Italian movie directors Alessandro Blasetti and Mario Camerini. The appointment of a literary figure to such a position at Cines was nevertheless an unusual move, signalling the possibility of new directions for the movie maker. Cecchi surrounded himself with \\"writers and artists\\" and moved decisively towards a greater emphasis on \\"arts films\\", but without neglecting the popular end of the market. Among commentators a general improvement in the quality of the studio's output was noted. A number of pioneering documentaries were also made on Cecchi's watch. However, Ludovico Toeplitz who had appointed him was finding himself under increasing pressure from the government, who were keen to take more of a \\"hands-on\\" role with respect to Italy's leading film studio. Toeplitz resigned his post in November 1933 (and emigrated shortly afterwards to England where he worked with Alexander Korda). Cecchi left his job at Cines very soon after Toeplitz, but he sustained an interest in cinema through and beyond the 1930s, producing for the appropriate specialist magazines lucid and critical movie reviews and related articles, with a particular focus - as before - on American movies. Through the 1930s and 1940s Cecchi also produced a steady trickle of screenplays based on works of recent or contemporary Italian literature. His screenwriting output peaked during the early 1940s, possibly reflecting a reduced demand for literary criticism in newspapers and magazines under wartime conditions. In 1940 and 1941 he worked on the script of Mario Soldati's Piccolo mondo antico and Mario Camerini's The Betrothed. = More war years = During the war years Cecchi retained contact with friends and colleagues as far as possible. Visitors to the family home in Rome through this period included Alberto Moravia, Elsa Morante, Leo Longanesi and Vitaliano Brancati. After 1945 Cecchi quickly re-established the disrupted connections that he had sustained with newspapers during the pre-war period. Readers were again interested in high quality literary criticism. = Post-war = Following a \\"brief flirtation\\" with the recently launched magazine Tempo, the publication to which Cecchi routinely contributed during his final two decades became the Corriere della Sera, published in Milan and distributed nationally. In 1946 he took a trip to London. Along with his domestic readership, he resumed his international contacts. Foreign publications for which he wrote regularly during the post-war period included La Parisienne, the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung and the Times Literary Supplement. In 1947 Arrigo Benedetti recruited him to write for L'Europeo. That same year he was appointed an academician of the Lincei. During the 1960s Cecchi teamed up with Natalino Sapegno to produce \\"Storia della letteratura italiana\\" (\\"History of Italian Literature\\"), a nine volume compendium published between 1965 and 1969. He authored many of the sections himself.  Recognition  Emilio Cecchi was frequently singled out for commendation both on account of his vast knowledge and intensive scholarship and because of his meticulously crafted prose style. In 1952 he was a recipient of the Feltrinelli Prize for non- fiction literature. He was a recipient of the Order of Merit (Knight of the Grand Cross) from the government in 1959.

A few secondary roads serve this area for the needs of forestry, recreational tourism activities.Open Street Map - Accessed February 3, 2019 Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second. The surface of Belle Rivi√®re Lake is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally from mid- December to mid-March.

He was then an Leverhulme Early Career Fellow in Anthropology at the London School of Economics. He is currently senior lecturer in anthropology at Goldsmiths, University of London and a visiting fellow at the International Inequalities Institute at the London School of Economics. He served on the U.K. Labour Party task force on international development in 2018-2019. Scholarship Hickel's initial work explored the political conflict in South Africa between migrant workers from rural Zululand and the African National Congress (ANC). His book Democracy as Death (2015) showed that rural migrants rejected many of the liberal values and policies of the ANC's platform, which they saw as undermining the hierarchical arrangements of rural society. In this book, and in a collection edited with Meghan Healy-Clancy, Ekhaya: The Politics of Home in KwaZulu- Natal, he argued that visions of kinship and domestic space in South Africa have been sites of colonial power and political struggle. Research on finance in South Africa explored conflicts over monetary and economic policy between the central bank and the labour movement. The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions (2017) attracted attention for arguing that the dominant narrative of 'progress' in international development is overstated, and that global poverty remains a widespread and persistent feature of the global economy, reproduced by power imbalances between the global North and global South. Aid transfers and loans are greatly outweighed by losses that the global South suffers in the form of tax evasion, illicit outflows, external debt arrangements, unequal trade rules, and structural adjustment programmes. He also argues that excess economic growth in high-income nations is at the root of worsening environmental crises. This problem, and alternatives to growth, are explored in Less is More: How Degrowth Will Save the World (2020). His work has been funded by Fulbright, the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Charlotte Newcombe Foundation, and the Leverhulme Trust.

The Storrs location is home to the Neag Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development, and additional locations are in Hartford, Waterbury, and Groton. It is ranked number 16 among public graduate schools of education in the nation. The schools' research and teaching programs have been funded by a wide number of institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education. History The Neag School of Education was founded in 1940 when the Connecticut Agricultural College became the University of Connecticut. It is based in the Charles B. Gentry Building, which as built in 1960 in honor of the former director of the Division of Teacher Training and University President. In 1999, the School of Education was renamed after Ray Neag, a businessman and graduate of UConn. Neag was co- Vice Chairman of Arrow International, Inc., a leading manufacturer of medical devices. The donation of $21 million is the largest gift given to an education school in the nation. In 2000, the building underwent major reconstruction, and a 20,000-square-foot wing was added to the west side of the building.

The program does not offer a teacher credential, which is only offered through the Teacher Certification Program for College Graduates (TCPCG) program (see Teacher Education). The undergraduate programs allow students to gain core competencies in teaching at all levels of education. The graduate programs allow for more specialized knowledge in a content area (math, science, or social studies) to prepare for additional certification later on. Doctoral programs allow students to pursue positions as professors or researchers in wide array of settings. The two main research units are the New Literacies Research Lab, which is recognized as the world's premier labor for reading comprehension and learning skills required for emerging information and communication technologies, and the Reading/Language Arts Center, which facilitates the improvement of literacy instruction. One particular focus of the program is strengthening Connecticut's investments in K-12 science programs and other STEM fields. Department of Educational Leadership The Department of Educational Leadership connects theory, practice, and policy in a variety of academic programs, including educational leadership, education policy, executive leadership, and more. The program is also hope to the university's Sport Management program, offering undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees. Department of Educational Psychology Teacher Education The Teacher Education center offers two programs. First, the Teacher Certification Program for College Graduates (TCPCG) is an 11-month, full-time, accelerated program that allows students to earn a Connecticut Teacher Certification and an MA in Curriculum and Instruction or MA in Educational Psychology. Students are required to complete coursework in addition to passing all relevant PRAXIS II examinations, as required by the state. Most recently, the program expanded to offer a track in Mandarin Chinese, in addition to its programs in French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Latin. Second, the Integrated Bachelor‚Äôs/Master‚Äôs (IB/M) Program in Teacher Education is a five-year, advanced program for undergraduates. Graduates of the program receive a Bachelor of Science in Education, a Master of Arts in Curriculum, and a Master of Arts in Educational Psychology (Special Education). The accelerated track of the program allows for students to gain exposure to a number of areas within five years. The IB/M program began in 1987 from conversations between the Holmes Group, John Goodlad, and the National Network for Educational Renewal. The IB/M program offers courses of study in the following areas: Elementary Education (Grades 1‚Äì6), Secondary Education (Grades 7‚Äì12), Comprehensive Special Education (K‚Äì12), and Music Education (PK‚Äì12). The program is built upon 6 key tenets which emphasize the common core of pedagogical knowledge required for all education majors, as well as clinical experience in a variety of environments. In the first two years of the program, students complete a well-rounded liberal arts coursework. In the Junior Year (known as the Common Core), students begin to take courses designed to help them learn about students as learners. In the senior year of the program, students gain more specific pedagogical knowledge. And, in the master's year, students gain clinic experience through an internship. In 2007, 90.7% of the IB/M program was female. =Accreditation & Rankings= The Neag School of Education is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). The accreditation covers teacher-preparation programs and advanced-education-preparation programs at the University of Connecticut and its regional campuses. In five specialty programs (Special Education, Educational Administration, Educational Psychology, Elementary Education, and Secondary Education), the Neag School of Education is recognized as in the top 25 in the nation. Considered a Public Ivy, the main campus of the University of Connecticut is located in Storrs and is considered one of the leading research universities in the United States. The school aims to be diverse with the following demographics in the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year: White (64%), Unknown (9.5%), Hispanic/Latinx (8.5%), Black/African American (8%), Asian (6.5%), Two or more races (3.1%), American Indian/Alaska Native (0.3%), and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (0.1%). Research Centers The Neag School of Education promotes interdisciplinary research and education. It works with five main research centers at the University of Connecticut: Research Centers Center for Behavioral Education and Research (CBER), Center for Education Policy Analysis (CEPA), Center on Postsecondary Education and Disability (CPED), Reading and Language Arts Center, and the Renzulli Center for Creativity, Gifted Education, and Talent Development.

Mirza Dinnayi is known as the director and co-founder of the Luftbr√ºcke Irak, an organization which helps Yazidi victims of the Iraq war, rescues women and children from the ISIS-controlled territories and transfers them to Germany, where they receive medical care.  Biography  Mirza Dinnayi was born in Sinjar, Iraq. His father Hasan Ali Aga was the chief of the Yazidi Dinnayi tribe. Since school Mirza started writing on Yazidi troubled state in Iraq. Later, as a student of the Medical faculty, he joined students‚Äô opposition to Saddam Hussein and his statecraft. In 1992 he had to flee to Iraqi Kurdistan. During the Iraqi Kurdish Civil War Mirza Dinnayi applied for political asylum in Germany. Soon, he became a prominent member of the Yazidi expatriate community. After the 2003 USA invasion of Iraq and Hussein‚Äôs fall, Dinnayi was offered a post of the presidential adviser for minority rights to Jalal Talabani. Mirza worked in this position for almost a year. On August 14, 2007, two suicide bombers set off car bombs in two Yazidi towns near Mosul. Mirza Dinnayi initiated the fundraising company for the victims and asked his friends from Neue Osnabr√ºcker Zeitung newspaper to print the call for help. Two german hospitals acceded, offering free of charge medical help to the injured children. The main issue was their transfer to Germany as the children were coming from poor families and had no documents. After the first mission, Dinnayi realized there were no charity organizations that worked with the Iraqi. This idea inspired him to establish Air Bridge Iraq (). Its name was taken after , a West Berlin rescue mission in the World War II. In 2007-2014 Luftbr√ºcke Irak helped 150 children and women to find asylum and get medical help in Germany. In early August 2014, ISIS soldiers occupied Sinjar. The Yazidi escaped to the Sinjar Mountains. Mirza Dinnayi was one of the persons, who persuaded the Iraq prime minister to evacuate the civilians by helicopters. Dinnayi himself guided the pilots, who didn‚Äôt know the local terrain. On the 12th of August, 2014, the Mi-7 helicopter with Dinnayi on board crashed in a few minutes after the ascent. With the broken leg and ribs, Mirza Dinnayi survived and was transported to Germany. Shortly afterward, in a wheelchair he returned to Iraq - to visit rescue camp in Khanke. In the rescue camp Dinnayi found out that the Yazidi women, saved from sexual slavery in ISIS, suffered from double psychological trauma - apart from the abuse itself, they experienced severe condemnation from the conservative Yazidi society. Mirza Dinnayi arranged the evacuation to Germany, where the specialist helped the victims to deal with severe depressions, anxiety attacks, self-imposed isolation, insomnia, and suicidal ideations. More than a thousand women and children were transferred to Germany, including future social rights activist and the Sakharov Prize winner Lamiya Haji Bashar.  Awards  In April 2016 Winfried Kretschmann, the prime minister of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, awarded Mirza Dinnayi with golden Staufer Medal for Humanitarian Service. In October 2019 Dinnayi received the Aurora Award for Awakening Humanity. As the laureate, he could choose 3 organizations to share the $1 mln prize. Dinnayi picked Air Bridge Iraq, SEED Foundation and the Shai Fund.

He was the regional boss of Miguel Alem√°n and helped coordinate international drug trafficking shipments from South and Central America to Mexico and the U.S. His roles in the cartel were also to coordinate oil theft operations. In 2012, he was indicted by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for drug trafficking activities. After fleeing Mexico to avoid gang-related violence, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was arrested in Texas during a sting operation in 2013. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2015. He is currently imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Ray Brook, New York. His expected release date is in 2029. Early life and career Ediel L√≥pez Falc√≥n was born in in Mexico. He was a high-ranking member of the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas, Mexico. He worked under a faction known as Los Metros. His code name was \\"Metro 5\\" (\\"M-5\\"). L√≥pez Falc√≥n also went by the alias \\"La Muela\\" (). L√≥pez Falc√≥n rose through the ranks of the cartel after several of his bosses were arrested or killed in the 2010s. He became the regional boss of Miguel Alem√°n, a city across the U.S.-Mexico border from Roma, Texas, from where he oversaw drug trafficking operations from Tamaulipas to Texas, and oil theft operations. In 2010, the Gulf Cartel and their former paramilitary group Los Zetas broke ties, triggering high levels of gang violence across Mexico. In 2011, Gulf Cartel members killed Los Metros chief Samuel Flores Borrego (\\"Metro 3\\"), which intensified the violence, starting a series of internal battles within the cartel. Several members of the Gulf Cartel were arrested or killed during this time, while others, like L√≥pez Falc√≥n, sought safe haven and relocated to the U.S with their families. According to a sealed indictment sworn in by a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (D.D.C.) on 7 May 2012, sometime in or around 2000 and up until February 2010, L√≥pez Falc√≥n and other members of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas conspired with intent to distribute at least of cocaine and of marijuana into the U.S. from Colombia, Panama, Guatemala, Mexico and elsewhere. This information was legally gathered by U.S. officials who intercepted L√≥pez Falc√≥n's phone conversations with other drug traffickers, where he discussed cocaine and marijuana shipments, procurement of firearms, and the smuggling of bulk cash. For his drug charges, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was ordered to forfeit all money and properties derived from these drug proceeds, as well as any properties used to facilitate his operations. If such properties could not be located, were sold or transferred to a third-party, or largely diminished in value, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was ordered to forfeit other assets to make up for the total amount of said property. This indictment was unsealed in court on 9 May 2013.  Arrest and trial  On 18 September 2015, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was arrested by U.S. authorities when walking out of a PlainsCapital Bank in Pharr, Texas. He was arrested as part of a sting operation that originated from an indictment issued by the D.D.C. against Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas leaders for their involvement in drug trafficking. On 25 September, an identity verification hearing was held before judge Dorina Ramos in McAllen to prove the man in question was indeed L√≥pez Falc√≥n. The confusion arose after L√≥pez Falc√≥n was identified as Ediel L√≥pez Garc√≠a at the moment of his arrest, which meant his name did not match the individual charged in the D.D.C indictment. In addition, the name in his indictment was nearly identical to that of former deceased cartel leader Edelio L√≥pez Falc√≥n (\\"El Yeyo\\"), who was also the regional leader of Miguel Alem√°n. His moniker \\"La Muela\\" was also used by Jaime or Javier Alejandro P√©rez, another Gulf Cartel member in Matamoros wanted on U.S. drug charges. During the identity hearing, the prosecution asked a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent to confirm L√≥pez Falc√≥n's identity. The agent said he was unable because the lead agent in the case was based in Washington, D.C. The agent present in court confirmed they had information that L√≥pez Falc√≥n was involved in trafficking several tons of narcotics into the U.S. He said his identification was done after the Mexican Armed Forces shared a picture of him to the DEA. The agent did not have the picture during the court session, however. L√≥pez Falc√≥n's attorney Arnulfo Guerra asked the agent multiple questions, including why the DEA had confused L√≥pez Falc√≥n's name. Guerra also said there are several people in Matamoros and along the border who call themselves La Muela. The judge was not satisfied with the agent's answers and postponed the hearing for 27 September. She asked the agent to come prepared for the hearing with evidence to present and to bring the lead agent to testify in court if he could.  Conviction  On 3 February 2015, L√≥pez Falc√≥n pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and marijuana into the U.S. before the D.D.C federal judge Barbara Jacobs Rothstein. In his guilty plea, L√≥pez Falc√≥n admitted he was a member of La Compa√±√≠a (), a name that collectively referred to the co-organization of the Gulf Cartel and its former paramilitary group Los Zetas. He said his criminal organization was responsible for smuggling many tons of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the U.S. and that he was directly involved in this process, as well as smuggling the cash proceeds back into Mexico. He also confirmed Los Zetas acted as the paramilitary wing of the Gulf Cartel, and that its members were mostly ex-military members who acted as enforcers and hitmen for the cartel in their region and against rival gangsters. On 31 July 2015, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was sentenced to 18 years in prison for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and marijuana into the U.S. The D.D.C also ordered him to forfeit US$15 billion; the court stated this was the total gross profits the Gulf Cartel made in drug proceeds from its smuggling centers across the U.S.-Mexico border during L√≥pez Falc√≥n's tenure. A few years after his sentencing, Mexican officials discussed the possibility of passing a law in Mexico permitting them to formally request the U.S. government for fifty percent of the earnings seized from a Mexican national convicted in the US in order to invest that money into their law enforcement agencies. L√≥pez Falc√≥n is currently serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook in Essex County, New York. His expected release date is on 27 September 2029. The investigation against L√≥pez Falc√≥n and other co-conspirators was headed by the DEA's field office in Houston and the DEA Bilateral Investigation Unit. It was part of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program. The prosecution attorney was Adri√°n Rosales, who was part of the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division's Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section. Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell and DEA Administrator Chuck Rosenberg were the first to announce L√≥pez Falc√≥n's conviction.

The battle took place on 26 August 1921 at Pookkottur in present day Malappuram district under the leadership of Vadakkuveettil Mammad for the force of Variyan Kunnathu Kunjahammed Haji while Cuthbert Buxton Lancaster and Captain P McEnroy were leading the British force. Battle of Pookkottur adorns an important role in Malabar rebellion.Tottenham GRF (ed), The Mappila Rebellion 1921-22, Govt Press Madras 1922 P 71Karim KK Muhammed Abdul, Variam Kunnath Kunjahammed Haji, Kalima Books, Kozhikkode 1992 (Malayalam) Background The Khilafat movement was much popular in Pookkottur, Malappuram, Kerala. After the outbreak of Malabar rebellion in 1921 the British army and police were forced to retreat from these areas. A group of British officials stuck in Malabar, including Malappuram district Magistrate Austin. They asked the district administration to bring force for their rescue. The force left Kozhikkode to Pokkottur in 22 Lorries and 25 cycles under Captain McEnroy and CB Lancaster. This information reached to Kunjahammed Haji and he discussed the matter with Pookkottur leaders including Vadakkuvettil Mammad and Kunji Thangal. They decided to attack the British army at Pookkottur. Rebels prepared themselves for war under the leadership of Mammad. The Battle On 1921 August 21 morning, rebels reached the spot, British force came in 22 Lorries and 25 cycles. The rebels' strategy was to let their lorries enter till they reach Pilakkal, then to besiege them from all the sides. But Parancheri Kunjarammutty who was not present in the last meeting of the rebels did not know this strategy, Kunjarammutty who was hiding behind the heap of soil opened the fire at the first lorry while there were only two or three Lorries reached the field. Hearing the gunshots, the army reversed the lorries. They threw smoke bombs to all the sides. Due to smoke rebels couldn't aim their guns properly. Bullets lost their targets. Still, they made heavy casualties to the military. Behind the veil of smoke, the military made to set machine guns to fire. When the smoke subsided, about ten soldiers walked on the road by foot towards Pilakkal. Without knowing that this was a trap, rebels came forward to capture them. Soldiers suddenly turned back and hid behind the machine guns and started firing. The rebels who followed them were killed. This round of firing happened two times and a number of rebels got killed. Kunjarammutty, who opened fire at the first with other rebels, came out on the field with swords when they had no more bullets in stock and they fought unto their last breath. Vadakkuveetil Mammad, the commander of rebels also was killed. The war continued for more than 3 hours and 400 rebels had to give their blood while only four died from the British side as per the official documents, but the eyewitness A Muhammed in his book \\"Swathandrasmaranakal\\" (Malayalam) says that he has seen the two lorries going to Westhill, Kozhikode which contained many dead bodies including injured soldiers. After the battle was fought, the army was on the way to Malappuram with Superindent of Police Cuthbert Buxton Lancaster (Lancaster was the son of a Leader in Church of England) and four soldiers in a lorry at the front. At Kummalippadi, a Mappila rebel, Mankara Thodiyil Kunjahmmed climbed on a tree and threw a grenade into the lorry in which police and soldiers were travelling. Lancaster and several soldiers were killed on the spot.

The Literacy Research Association has named The Arthur Applebee Award for Excellence in Research on Literacy in his honor.  Life and education  Born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, he grew up in a rural area of upstate New York, where he attended school up until his senior year of high school when his family moved and he attended the University High School of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He then attended and graduated from Yale with a BA in English in 1968. Even before his graduation he was publishing research articles based on the NCTE archives, where he worked part time. His undergraduate research became the basis of his still widely cited first book, Tradition and Reform in the Teaching of English. He then obtained a MAT at Harvard University in 1970. As a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, he did two years alternative service at the Child Development Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital. He completed his Doctorate in 1973 at the University of London, supervised by James N. Britton. His doctoral dissertation formed the basis of his most cited work, The Child‚Äôs Concept of Story. He married Judith Langer, also a renowned researcher in literature and literacy. They published joint work and are also notable as the first husband and wife to each hold the position of distinguished professor at SUNY (the highest rank for faculty). Applebee began his teaching career in England following a postdoctoral year as an evaluator on an OECD Research Unit at the University of Lancaster. He taught from 1974-1976 at Tarleton High School in Lancaster. He returned to the United States to work for the National Council of Teachers of English, and then took up an associate professorship at Stanford University from 1980‚Äì87. At that point he moved to SUNY-Albany as a full professor (then distinguished professor in 2007) where he remained until his death. During his tenure there he was director of the National Research Center on English Learning and Achievement (until 1996 called the National Research Center on Literature Teaching and Learning). Applebee died on September 20, 2015, due to complications of Lewy body dementia.  Research  Arthur Applebee‚Äôs first book, Tradition and Reform in the Teaching of English, documented and critically analyzed the history of secondary English instruction from colonial times until the 1960s, providing insights that have guided later progressive developments in the teaching of English.Durst, Russell, Newell George, and Marshall James (eds.) (2017) English Language Arts Research and Teaching: Revisiting and Extending Arthur Applebee‚Äôs Contributions, New York: Routledge, A number of his subsequent inquiries has continued to document the changing developments in curriculum and practice, including monographs for the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and numerous journal articles. His second book The Child‚Äôs Concept of Story, using a mix-methods design looks at developments of story concept in children from pre-school though adolescence across several dimensions, including symbolization, elaboration, role of spectator, narrative structure, awareness of fantasy, and personal response. Its citation history indicates how it has become a cornerstone work for studies of children‚Äôs literary development. His later book Literature in the Secondary School pursues the implications and implementations of that work for contemporary classroom practices. He also applied the insights to his multiple textbook series for primary and secondary schools. Over his career he gave increasing focus to curriculum and practices in the teaching of writing, resulting in numerous articles, NAEP reports, and the books Writing in the Secondary School, and Writing Instruction that Works. He also pursued the impact of learning to write on the thought and intellectual growth of the developing student. In this study he reached beyond the Language Arts Classrooms to schoolwork in the sciences, social studies, and practical arts, as presented in How Writing Shapes Thinking (with Judith Langer). All these themes came together in his reconceptualization of the Language Arts curriculum as a conversation, most fully articulated in his book Curriculum as Conversation. In addition to his scholarly publication, Applebee was quoted in and contributed to popular and policy discussions about language and learning. For example, he published a 2012 article in The Atlantic arguing that \\"Great Writing Comes out of Great Ideas.\\"  Selected book publications  * Tradition and Reform in the Teaching of English (1974).

Price was also responsible for funding the construction of St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Lubbock, Texas, St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, and St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in Wake Forest, North Carolina. The latter two churches were named after Price's patron saint, Catherine of Siena. In April 1936 Price was elevated into the Nobility of the Holy See and made a papal countess by Pope Pius XI.

It contains a single species, Dendromaia unamakiensis. Dendromaia is both the oldest known varanopid, oldest known synapsid and the only member of the Varonopidae family to be discovered in Nova Scotia. Known from a large partial skeleton preserved with its tail wrapped around a much smaller partial skeleton, Dendromaia may also represent the oldest known occurrence of parental care in the fossil record. While the larger skeleton possessed certain mycterosaurine-like features, the smaller skeleton resembled basal varanopids such as Archaeovenator and Pyozia, creating uncertainty over whether characteristics at the base of Varanopidae have legitimate phylogenetic significance or instead reflect the immaturity of basal varanopid specimens.  Discovery  Dendromaia unamakiensis is known from a slab and counterslab containing two skeletons. The specimen, NSM017GF020.001, was discovered in a petrified lycopod stump at Point Aconi on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. This site is part of the Sydney Mines Formation, which is dated to the late Moscovian stage of the Carboniferous period, 309-306 million years ago. \\"Dendromaia\\" roughly translates to \\"the mother in the tree\\", according to its discovery in a stump and proposed parental care. The specific name references Unama'kik, the Mi'kmaq name for Cape Breton Island. The genus and species were described by Hillary Maddin, Arjan Mann, and Brian Hebert in 2019. Hebert had discovered the specimen in 2017. The two skeletons had different sizes and preserved different areas, with the larger skeleton (designated the holotype) incorporating a large portion of the rear half of the body and the smaller skeleton (designated the paratype) including a skull and only fragments of the postcranium, 1/4th the size of the larger one. These skeletons were inferred to represent two individuals of a single new taxon based on their similar overlapping anatomy, apparent varanopid ancestry, close association, and the fact that there are no other varanopids known from Nova Scotia.  Description  The 6 preserved dorsal vertebrae of the larger skeleton were among the most characteristic bones in the animal. They shared several traits with Mycterosaurus, such as tall rectangular neural spines with slight depressions at their base. However, the rib facets at the tip of the transverse processes were not vertical, but instead oriented diagonally. Like other non-varanodontine varanopids, the lower edge of each centrum had a rounded keel. 10 incomplete caudal vertebrae preserved on the counterpart were elongated and had low neural spines. Holocephalous (single-headed) ribs and Heleosaurus-like gastralia were also present, though osteoderms were seemingly absent. The plate-like bones composing the pelvis were not fused to each other, and Dendromaia had a large pubic foramen like that of Heleosaurus. The femur was lightly-built and twisted, similar to mycterosaurines. The rest of the leg and foot was present but incomplete. The larger specimen may have been 20 to 30 centimeters (7.9-12 inches) long from the tip of the snout to the base of the tail, and its full tail length is unknown but likely elongated. The small skeleton's poorly-preserved skull was triangular and pointed like those of Archaeovenator, Pyozia, and Heleosaurus. It had thin, curved teeth on the maxilla (without a canine region) and smaller teeth on the palate, which also possessed a varanopid-like pterygoid and cultriform process. Isolated hyoid bones were also identifiable. Like the larger skeleton, the small skeleton's vertebrae had a rounded keel on their underside. It also possessed several limb bone fragments, including a twisted humerus.  Classification  Dendromaia is the oldest member of a family of amniotes known as varanopids. Varanopids are traditionally considered early synapsids (part of the lineage of amniotes leading to mammals), although some studies alternatively propose that they are diapsid reptiles related to Orovenator. The describers of Dendromaia prefer a position for varanopids among synapsids, citing both biological characteristics (parental care) and arguing that traits which link varanopids to diapsids may be based on oversampling of juvenile specimens at the base of Varanopidae. To investigate the position of Dendromaia among other varanopids, the describers adapted a phylogenetic analysis matrix previously utilized by Brocklehurst & Fr√∂bisch (2018). The resulting strict consensus tree (average result of most parsimonious trees) of the parsimony analysis placed Dendromaia in a polytomy near the base of Varanopidae, along with Pyozia and a clade which forks into Varanodontinae and Mycterosaurinae. The Bayesian analysis recovers a similar result, albeit with the polytomy resolved, placing Dendromaia as the sister taxon to Pyozia. The following cladogram is based on the results of the Bayesian analysis in Maddin, Mann, & Hebert (2019):  Paleobiology  The delicate preservation of the skeletons indicated that they likely died and were quickly buried at the same place and time. They were positioned with the smaller skeleton encircled by the tail of the larger skeleton. These taphonomic qualities led the paleontologists who described them to propose that the two skeletons were denning together under the roots of a lycopod tree, with the smaller skeleton likely representing the offspring of the larger skeleton. This may be the oldest fossil evidence of parental care, predating the previously oldest evidence, an aggregation of varanopids from the Permian of South Africa which may represent their own species (Microvaranops parentis) or specimens of Heleosaurus scholtzi. On the other hand, it remains a possibility that the two skeletons were not close relatives, and instead simply sheltered from a storm in the same stump. The anatomy of the juvenile Dendromaia skeleton is remarkably similar to that of basal varanopids such as Archaeovenator and Pyozia, indicating that these genera may be based on juvenile specimens of larger varanopids. Likewise, certain characteristics (such as reduced dentition and limb development) found to link basal varanopids with diapsids may be a consequence of juvenile specimen sampling, rather than valid phylogenetic signals.

Founded in 1974 and re-dedicated as a feminist theatre in 1977, it produced unique works on wide-ranging topics both in local productions and also through touring and performances at theater festivals. At the Foot of the Mountain Theater closed in 1991.  History  Founded by Martha and Paul Boesing, and Jan Magrane in 1974, At the Foot of the Mountain grew out of their experiences with experimental theater including at The Open Theater in New York City and Firehouse Theater in the 1960s in Minneapolis. Boesing's involvement in the theater ended temporarily in 1984 when she accepted an 18-month Bush Fellowship to focus on her playwriting.  Organizational Structure  The collective's tasks included the shows themselves, but also the rest of the logistics‚Äîpublicity, costumes, finances; within a non- hierarchical consensus-based structure. \\"There are no role models,\\" said Boesing‚Äîwho was also the playwright for the first 10 years‚Äîin an 1979 interview. Audience participation also was a critical ingredient throughout the theater's work. AFOM was able to pay its members a regular amount each week, so that AFOM could be their primary focus. Funding came from a combination of ticket sales, touring, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Regional Arts Council, the Northwest Area Foundation and the Minnesota Humanities Commission.  Works  At the Foot of the Mountain mainly operated out of the People‚Äôs Center on the West Bank of the University of Minnesota, and produced 1‚Äì4 works each year. Generally, each work was a collective effort, with the script being written internally in collaboration with the cast. Production of Antigone Too: Rites of Love and Defiance was based on a script that included much of Sophocles' text, plus the stories of 17 American women involved in politics including Dorothy Day, Emma Goldman, Margaret Sanger and Fannie Lou Hamer. The 21-member cast, selected from 50 applicants, worked on the production over an eight-week residency. At the Foot of the Mountain's topics were diverse, including prostitution, motherhood, nuclear stockpiling, the Catholic church, rape culture, U.S. involvement in Nicaragua and prison reform.  Controversy  Haunted by the Holy Ghost a 1983 production‚Äîwritten by co-founder and collective member Jan Magrane‚Äîwas a direct statement on the inherent oppressiveness of the Catholic Church. Negative responses included the Minneapolis City Council declining to pass a resolution commending the theater for its 10-year contribution to the city, and an inquiry by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights into Minnesota State Arts Board funding of At the Foot of the Mountain, claiming the work was defamatory, and requesting that future funding be restricted.

The explosions were carried out by Ilya Galkin and Mikhail Denisenko. Their motive was hatred of society. Bombings In the period from April 3, 2008 to February 20, 2009 there were 9 explosions in which 8 were killed and 46 people were injured. April 3, 2008 - in the Kirov Park, Lazarevskoye Microdistrict, an explosive disguised as a cigarette case that was lying on a bench exploded. Two people were injured. April 7, 2008 - in the square on Victory Street, Lazarevskoye Microdistrict, an explosive disguised as a bag exploded. A policeman was seriously injured from the explosion. June 11, 2008 - on Victory Street in the Lazarevskoye Microdistrict, explosives disguised as a flask exploded. One man died July 2, 2008 - in the Adlersky City District an explosion in a multi-storey building. As a result of the explosion, the house was partially collapsed. 2 people died and 20 were injured. July 30, 2008 - an object exploded in the hands of a man in the Adlersky City District. One person died and one was injured. August 7, 2008 - An explosion occurred on the beach at Loo Microdistrict. 2 people died and 20 were injured. November 10, 2008 - in the Adlersky City District, an explosive disguised as a can of beer exploded. One person was injured. December 29, 2008 - An explosion occurred on a street in Adlersky City District. One man died. February 20, 2009 - an explosion occurred in a construction trailer in the Khostinsky City District. One person died and one was injured. Investigation After the explosion on June 11, 2008, all the explosions were combined in one series. The laying of explosives on November 10, 2008 hit the surveillance cameras. But due to the poor quality of the video, the only thing that could be determined was the model of the car. It was GAZ 31105. At that time, there were 800 such cars in Sochi. All owners of these cars were summoned for interrogations. Among them was Mikhail Denisenko. Ilya Galkin knew that they were looking for Denisenko‚Äôs car and organized an explosion on February 20, 2009 so that the police wouldn‚Äôt search for Denisenko. Galkin found the mobile number of the owner of the same car as in Denisenko and phoned him. He also sent him an SMS with the text \\"How to connect this?\\" He disguised the explosives as a flashlight, put the parts for the explosives in a bag, took a bottle of beer, food and put it all near the gatehouse at the construction site. Then one worker died and another was injured. Police found Galkin through a SIM card. After Galkin became a suspect, it was decided to pick up his laptop from him. The boss noticed how Galkin plays games on the laptop in time and took it from him. Galkin panicked. The laptop had a lot of information about explosives. It was April 14, 2009. That evening he told everything to his mother with whom he lived. They collected all the materials for the explosives and took them to the wasteland. During this, the police watched him. Mikhail Denisenko was detained on April 14, 2009. Ilya Galkin was detained on April 15, 2009. Perpetrators The organizer and inspirer of the explosions was Galkin. Galkin and Denisenko were neighbors and were friends since childhood. At school, they were bullied. Denisenko was very dependent on Galkin. They were prone to cruelty. They found instructions for making explosives on the Internet. Both were united by hatred of society. Ilya Ilyich Galkin was born in 1983. He had a mother Nadezhda Galkina, father Ilya Deshko and a brother- in-law on his father Alexander Deshko. After school, he studied at a police school. After which he worked in the Sochi police. The first time Galkin made explosives in February 2008. At the time of his arrest, he was a lieutenant. In one of the interviews, Galkin's father said that he was attacked by the homeless in his childhood, and was nearly strangled once. In the winter of 2003, he beat and shot three times with a pneumatic pistol at a homeless man. The poor man survived but ceased to see. All this was during working hours and his partner saw it. Between April 12 and 17, 2007, he killed 5 homeless people and his brother and severely wounded one. For murders, he used a signal pistol redone for firing hunting cartridges. He killed his victims with a shot in the face. He searched for victims in the district of heating mains. Knife wounds were found on the bodies of the homeless. The bodies of the homeless were discovered on April 17. On the evening of April 17, he had a drink with his brother and accidentally talked about the killings of the homeless. After that, he decided to kill him. He hit him on the head with an ax and dismembered the body. Mikhail Sergeyevich Denisenko was born in 1984. He had a wife, Inna Denisenko. Previously, he divorced his other wife due to the fact that Galkin did not like her. He worked as an operator on the local television channel Efkate. He worked there for 7 years. He was fond of electronics and technology. He made electric detonators for bombs. Legal proceedings The trial of Galkin and Doroshenko began on June 18, 2010. On May 17, 2011, a video of interrogation and torture with Ilya Galkin appeared on the Internet. January 31, 2014 Ilya Galkin was sentenced to life imprisonment and Mikhail Denisenko to 21 years and 6 months in prison. They are also required to pay 54.3 million rubles in civil claims. They are also obligated to pay the city administration of Sochi 43.7 million rubles. On October 23, 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict On April 4, 2015, Galkin applied to the European Court of Human Rights.

Her San Francisco restaurant, Elka, earned national acclaim. In 1994, she was nominated for the James Beard Foundation Award for Best California Chef.  Biography  Elka Ruth Gilmore was born in 1960 in San Antonio, Texas. Her first restaurant job, as a dishwasher, was at Caf√© Camille in Austin, when she was around 12 years old. She left home at age 16 to live with her grandmother in Madison, Wisconsin. As a teenager, she worked as a prep cook at L‚Äô√âtoile in Madison; when the chef quit, Gilmore was promoted to chef. At 18, she travelled to Boston, New York, and Provence (where she apprenticed at a restaurant in Cotignac), before settling in Los Angeles in 1982. There, she worked at restaurants Tumbleweed, Checkers, and Palette. She was the co-owner of Camelion's, which served French-inspired cuisine. In 1991, at the age of 31, she opened her restaurant Elka in the Miyako Hotel in San Francisco's Japantown, serving a blend of Asian and French cuisine. The restaurant was met with national acclaim. The New York Times Magazine described the restaurant's dishes as \\"light and memorable\\" with \\"deep and husky flavors\\"; it called Gilmore \\"the enfant terrible of the modern California kitchen\\" and \\"an iconoclastic cook.\\" In 1994, she was nominated for the James Beard Foundation's Award for Best California Chef. In 1995, she opened Libert√©, a French-American restaurant, in San Francisco. It closed after a few months. She was later hired by the Omni Berkshire Place Hotel in New York to open and run Kokachin, a seafood restaurant. In 1998, she returned to San Francisco and opened Oodles, an Asian fusion restaurant; it closed shortly thereafter. Reviewing Oodles, Mark Bittman of The New York Times wrote that \\"[d]espite the angular, not-especially-attractive interior, the restaurant is comfortable and inviting, and the brazen nature of the food gives a meal here a true sense of excitement.\\" Gilmore was recognized as a champion of women chefs. She was also credited for her mentorship of fellow lesbian cooks. In 1993, she co-founded the organization Women Chefs & Restaurateurs, along with fellow San Francisco chefs Barbara Tropp and Joyce Goldstein. She died on July 6, 2019, in San Francisco, of cardiac arrest due to ongoing medical issues.

Born January 2, 1984, in Brookline, Massachusetts, Geller is an outspoken voice on the Jewish left, an organizer and activist for the BDS movement and Palestinian human rights, and a frequent speaker against Zionism, as well as antisemitism. Despite the disproportionate amount of attention Jews get for speaking out against Israel, Geller has consistently emphasized the need to center Palestinians in the struggle for their own liberation. Geller‚Äôs activism often employs non-traditional tactics, drawing on performance art, erudite references and irony to provoke social discomfort without expressing an explicit political agenda. His performance art, on the other hand, frequently relies on methods of activism, blurring any distinction between art and politics. Most famously, Geller is the founder of #renoirsucksatpainting, a tongue-in-cheek social movement to remove the paintings of Auguste Renoir from museums around the world. He has frequently leveraged the Renoir Sucks at Painting project into media coverage for the BDS movement and other social causes.  Early life  At sixteen, Geller was arrested for burning an American Flag on the 4th of July and draping the charred remains over the liberty bell at town hall in Brookline. For his senior capstone project at his small arts high school, Geller learned Aikido, and demonstrated his mastery by fighting his mother. In college, Geller conned his way into an appearance on the daytime television show Judge Mathis. The performance put on by Geller‚Äôs troupe, filled with outrageous claims, false hysterics, and demands for justice, mocks both reality television and the criminal justice system. In 2005, George Edward Jed Smock, Jr. AKA ‚ÄúBrother Jed,‚Äù came to protest liberal values at the Colorado College campus. Geller showed up dressed in Klansman robes and joined Brother Jed‚Äôs rally, thus aligning Jed‚Äôs crusade with the overt white supremacy associated with the KKK. Later Geller distanced himself from the early performance due to its racial insensitivity.  Anti-Zionist Activism  In 2007, while traveling the world, Geller arrived in Palestine, where the struggle of the Palestinians for their own liberation, and Israel‚Äôs violent response, left an indelible mark on him. He returned to Palestine several times over the course of the next few years, and later continued his activism back in the USA, where he has been an active member of many groups organizing on behalf of Palestinian liberation, such as NSJP, IJAN, USCPR, and others, and has been a frequent contributor to a variety of conferences and journals. = Palestinian Flag on the Pyramid of Giza = In 2009, Geller joined a group of international Palestinian activists who were attempting to break the blockade of Gaza. After being turned away at the border, Geller and his cohort scaled the walls of the Pyramid of Giza and flew an enormous Palestinian flag from halfway up. The image became an iconic representation of the attempts to break the blockade and was featured in newspapers throughout the Arab world. Palestinian Flag on the Temple of Giza = Students for Justice in Palestine = While Geller was a student at North Eastern Law School, he became president of the local chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, where he staged a series of interventions to bring awareness to the cause. These culminated in the group delivering mock eviction letters to students that resulted in SJP being suspended by the administration. Geller immediately took the case to the national media gaining widespread attention for the incident, defending the incident in an op-ed in the Boston Globe and an appearance on Democracy Now. = New Orleans City Council BDS Bill = In 2017, Geller was instrumental in the New Orleans Palestinian Solidarity Committee's successful lobbying of the City Council to pass a Boycott Divestment and Sanctions bill in solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Because the legislation didn‚Äôt explicitly name Israel, opting instead to target ‚Äúhuman-rights violators‚Äù, Zionist groups claimed that the NOPSC had tricked the city council into passing the resolution and after fierce counter-lobbying from powerful pro-Israel forces, the city council rescinded the resolution.  Activism as Perforance Art  In addition to Geller‚Äôs history as a political provocateur, he has also used his knack for creating viral ideas and images to mount ambiguous, seemingly frivolous interventions in the art and music world. Often, Geller uses these absurdist actions to build a platform to raise other, more serious cultural and political issues. The most famous example is #Renoirsucksatpainting. = Renoir Sucks at Painting = In February 2015 Geller created the instagram @Renoir_sucks_at_painting, and began posting images of Renoir paintings and captioning them with a combination of sardonic wit and vitriol. Soon after, the account began to go viral, attracting the attention of reddit streams, content aggregators, art critics, and Renoir‚Äôs own descendants. At the same time, Geller began to use the platform to make larger political critiques. When Renoir's great-great-granddaughter responded to an instagram post in May of 2015 saying \\"when your great-great-grandfather paints anything worth 78.1 million dollars...then you can criticize. In the mean time[sic], it is safe to say that the free market has spoken and Renoir did NOT suck at painting.\\" Geller reposted the comment and replied, \\"The free market has indeed spoken. Climate change; the Prison Industrial Complex; Slavery; Settler Colonialism; the destruction of sea otter habitats; the evisceration of the proletariat; commercials on TV; Food Deserts; Citizens United; National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets (457 Million Box Office!); for-profit healthcare; and, yes, the exaltation of your great grand pappy, Baron Von Treacle himself, #Renoirhave all been unleashed upon us by the free market.\\" Through this exchange, the account began to gain significant media attention.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/renoir-sucks- duel_n_5616b7aee4b0e66ad4c6e9b4 On October 5, 2015, at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Geller organized the first of what would become many major anti-Renoir protests. When the protest garnered criticism in the Boston Globe by Sebastian Smee, a Pulitzer prize-winning art critic, Geller responded by publicly challenging Smee to a duel. The feud quickly gained national attention, and along with a second protest at the Metropolitan Museum of New York a week later, helped skyrocket the movement to headlines across the globe. Geller continued traveling the country organizing anti-Renoir protests at art museums in major cities around the country. After a protest at the Art Institute of Chicago, Geller was a guest on a local news station there, where he once again expanded the focus of his movement from Renoir's paintings themselves to the misogyny and white supremacy of the canon at large. \\"At the end of the day,\\" he said, \\"it‚Äôs about access, who has access to our museums... I think the art institute should sell some of these Renoirs...and instead buy some art that is painted by women or people of color.\\" Many in the media began to realize the Renoir Sucks movement was part of the growing ouvre of protests and performance art from Geller. While the movement reached its apex in the fall of 2015, it has continued to spawn mini-protests all over the world, including at the White House where President Trump is an admirer of Renoir. Art critics are still grappling with the after-effects of the movement as recently as June 2019. = Misc Other Performance Art Pieces = While Renoir Sucks at Painting is Geller's most well known aesthetic protest, there were any smaller ones that preceded it. * In the mid 2000s, Geller organized a protest at the Phish concert at Fenway Park, a series of protests at Matisyahu concerts, and attempted to sell radically anti-Creed merchandise outside of Creed concerts. * More recently Geller has resurfaced in the news for his satirical Venmo requests of celebrities, politicians, and public intellectuals including Ben Affleck, Jonathan Franzen, Sean Spicer, and more. *Geller has starred as cohost of a leftist Boston sports podcast with his brother called Phone Wallet Keys David Ortiz.  Notable Confrontations  In addition to the array of staged satirical public performances, Geller also has a history of spontaneous confrontations with politicians. *A 2007 spat with Tony Blair that left Geller in a trashcan after Blair‚Äôs security team intervened. * In 2008, there was a vicious back-and-forth with former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia during a question and answer period at Harvard Law, where Geller demanded an answer as to why, according to Scalia's arguments in DC vs Heller, Geller shouldn't be allowed to purchase a surface-to-air missile and a bazooka. The exchange caused such an outburst of laughter in the auditorium that the Q-and-A was ended prematurely. * In 2014, Geller sent dessert to senator Chuck Schumer at a restaurant in New York to \\"thank him for subverting democracy,\\" prompting Schumer to flip him off. Much of Geller's work remains unrecognized by the general public today, and his motives and consequences are still unexamined. It is difficult to know which actions ought to be understood as art, protest, or something else entirely. Examples include a drag performance in Provincetown called \\"The Angry Geisha‚Äù in 2007, the sinking of an old wooden boat named S.S. Marjorie in Boston Harbor in 2011, and, most recently, handing out copies of the Declaration of Independence in London in 2019.

It is a parasite of fishes and is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. Description Pontobdella muricata is a long, cylindrical, somewhat flattened leech, narrowing at both ends. It has a number of annulations, which do not correspond to its internal segmentation, and is one of the largest sea leeches, with a length up to long when at rest, and double that length when stretched. The anterior end has a sucker with which it feeds, and the posterior end bears another sucker with which it adheres to its host. The skin is rough and covered with small warts; the colour varies, juveniles are usually black or dark green with small speckles, while adults are pale grey, tan, or olive-green. Distribution and habitat Native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the species ranges from the Arctic, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea, to the Mediterranean Sea. It has also been reported from the United States, Canada, Namibia, and Pakistan, but some of these records may be due to misidentification. It is found on the seabed at depths down to about and attached to large demersal fish. Ecology This leech is an external parasite of cartilagenous fishes such as the marbled electric ray (Torpedo marmorata), the common stingray (Dasyatis pastinaca), and the thornback ray (Raja clavata), and less often of ray-finned fish such as the European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), the black scorpionfish (Scorpaena porcus), and the red scorpionfish (S. scrofa). It is found attached to the gills, the abdomen, and the bases of the fins of the host, where it feeds by sucking blood. It is quiescent during the day, holding itself motionless and partially coiled, attached by its posterior sucker, but becomes active at night, when it feeds. It can separate from its host and swim by flattening its body. It is the intermediate host for the protozoan Trypanosoma raiae, which it carries in its gut and transmits to rays. Like all leeches, P. muricata is a hermaphrodite, and fertilisation is internal. The eggs pass through the clitellum, where each is enclosed in a spherical cocoon. These are attached to empty bivalve or gastropod shells on the seabed and are pale at first, but darken with age. They are often irregularly grouped together, each with a slender, twisted stalk connecting it to a spreading, membranous holdfast. The sphere is filled with a thick, gelatinous material with the developing embryo spirally coiled within. When it is nearly long and ready to hatch, a pair of small, rounded protuberances at the side of the sphere fall off, allowing the juvenile leech to emerge, and search for a suitable host fish.

(1860) by Theobald von Oer, Among the audience are Wieland (2. from left, seated), Herder (center, seated with cap) and Goethe (in front of the pillar, right). Temple of the Muses with statue of Melpomene, Greek muse of tragic poetry and song, built in 1803, Tiefurt Mansion The Weimar courtyard of the muses is a term, that had ermerged during the 19th century. It refers to an elite fellowship of people in Classical Weimar (1772-1805), that was made up of nobles and commoners, courtiers, civil servants, writers, artists and scientists, who congregated around the central character, Duchess Anna Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, pioneer of Weimar Classicism and patroness of the arts. Duchess Anna Amalia was the mother and from 1758 until 1775 regent for the infant Grand Duke Karl August von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach. The concept and character of the courtyard of the muses and Anna Amalias image, role and personal motives have been reviewed and largely \\"deconstructed\\" during recent decades. Modern revisions predominantly present sober conclusions and largely disagree with 19th century claims of a society in progress as a result of the utilization of the guiding principles of the Enlightenment and the cultivation of the genius.  Background  Visual inspiration was Theobald von Oer's 1860 painting: Weimar courtyard of the muses. Schiller reading to the court in Tiefurt, in older mentions, also called Weimar's Golden Days. The painting depicts a rather fictional, ideally arranged scene around 1794/95: An illustrious party, that consists of noble members of the court and commoners alike (scholars, artists and scientists), has gathered, regardless to class etiquette and formalities, in and around the Tiefurt Muse temple (which was only built in 1803), while listening to Friedrich Schiller's deliberations. In the creation of a cultivated and witty conviviality, the Duchess was assisted by poet and philosopher Christoph Martin Wieland, who had joined the court as the teacher of the two princes in 1772. The courtyard of the muses would meet at the ducal Wittumspalais, the rural summer residences in Ettersburg Palace and Park and Tiefurt Manor, debate and discuss books and literature, the latest musical events and plays that had been staged, and contribute to the production of journals and paperbacks in Weimar, Tiefurt and Jena.  Recent reinterpretation  Duchess Anna Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach with her sons, around 1773-74 Not until the late 20th century had this idea of a Weimar courtyard of the muses been contested and dismissed as pseudoscientific 19th century legend formation and romanticism. Contemporary sources of the Classical Weimar court never referred to a courtyard of the muses and Duchess Anna Amalia is not known to have at any time discontinued standard court ceremony or contested common class regulations. Her role as pioneer of Weimar Classicism has been challenged by author J. Berger, as he points out that the duchess has given the primacy of the arts not to literature but to music. Berger also exhorts, that she does not qualify as a true patroness of the arts because she refused unconditional promotion of free artists, but treated them as civil servants who were obliged to perform certain tasks. However, according to author J. H. Ulbricht, all these scientific disenchantments have failed to notably penetrate the communicative and cultural memory of the public. The narrative of the historiographically colorful idyll of Classical Weimar begins with Anna Amalias death and continues to be told until 1993. Already in 1807, shortly after her burial, Goethe sought the opportunity to advertize Weimar's cultural prowess via the Duchess' obituary, that he published in a series of journals. The second volume of a 1908 trilogy on the life of Anna Amalia is titled: Duchess Amalies Courtyard of the Muses and has been published repeatedly under this name. In 1844 the academic historian Wilhelm Wachsmuth published a historical sketch in which the term courtyard of the muses was used for the first time in a scholarly context, steadily spread for decades and solidified into a formula. Eventually, in a 1993 typology attempt the term courtyard of the muses was determined as one of five types of European courts and Weimar was referred to as the courtyard of the muses par excellence.

Shindo is a new Inspector working for Division 1 alongside his best friend, Kei Mikhail Ignatov. Shindo and Ignatov are in charge of their Enforcers who assist and protect them. Shindo often analyzes the situations he finds himself in using his mentalist skills known as a Mental Trace. Throughout the series, Shindo's team learns of a criminal organization called Bifrost. As the series explores varied encounters, Bifrost's influence becomes apparent with the outcome of Shindo's and Ignatov's investigation to be resolved in the upcoming 2020 anime film, Psycho-Pass 3 First Inspector, which was released for a theater run in Japan, followed by streaming release world- wide, in March, 2020. The character originated from director Naoyoshi Shiotani's desire to develop a new cast for the sequel to the previous Psycho- Pass series. Shindo was written by Tow Ubukata, Makoto Fukami and Ryo Yoshigami, all of whom wanted Shindo and Ignatov to be close friends despite their differences. Shindo's characterization caused the development team difficulties because he was intended to be portrayed as a likable character due to his importance as a highly skilled detective. He was voiced by Y≈´ki Kaji, who enjoyed the work due to the character's actions and relationships explored in the narrative. Critical reception to Shindo has been positive. Despite him not being written by the series' first writer, Gen Urobuchi, he fit well within the cast thanks to his mental skills and further characterization. His relationship with Ignatov also received positive responses. Creation and development During the making of the series, director Naoyoshi Shiotani entrusted the writers Tow Ubukata, Makoto Fukami and Ryo Yoshigami with handling a new cast. Fukami was surprised that despite the new story and cast, the series still felt like Psycho-Pass. They believed that the underlying close relationship between Shindo and Ignatov with Bifrost would engage the audience. Shiotani and the producers also discussed the idea of a \\"Total Character Change\\" saying, \\"think of them as two good buddies\\" despite outwardly differing personalities and physical appearance. Ubukata presents Shindo shorter than Ignatov and has them being of different national origins. Ubukata also presents the concept of \\"psychology vs. combat,\\" making Shindo a mentalist while Ignatov is a former soldier trained in martial arts. And while Shindo's cheerfulness may strike one as na√Øve compared to Ignatov's stoic nature, he is discovered to be a keen sleuth as the series unfolds. While previous duos featured as the leads from the Psycho-Pass series had different genders, Shindo and Ignatov were the first ones to have the share the same. Shiotani said there was no meaning behind as the series was inspired by Japanese police dramas which tend to have multiple types of duos. Shiotani wanted Shindo to look like a weak person in contrast to returning and new Psycho-Pass most notably due to his low height. Ubukata insisted that Shindo and Ignatov be written by Fukami, who said early in the making of the series that Ubakata did not like Shindo. Ubukata also said that Shindo appears to be a good detective because he understands the criminal mind. Fukami also found Shindo a difficult character to write because of his aura of mystery and use of trickery to obtain results. Yoshigami found the character appealing because he was a humanizing factor within the cast, comparing him to \\"a con artist,\\" but in a police-like sense. Like all Psycho-Pass characters, Shindo was designed by mangaka Akira Amano, who drew an illustration of him, Ignatov and fellow character Azusawa Koichi for the final episode of Psycho-Pass 3. =Voice actor= Y≈´ki Kaji voices Arata Shindo. Y≈´ki Kaji voiced Shindo in the series. Upon seeing his character for the first time, Kaji found him stylish. Kaji was overjoyed when he got the role of Shindo during the audition, having watched the previous Psycho-Pass works and being a fan of them. Kaji enjoyed the character's relationship with Ignatov due to their close relationship and Shindo's style of interacting with the characters from previous seasons. Kaji laughed when first reading the script because he found the cast unique and looked forward to the characters' growth during the series. He had mixed feelings about Shindo wielding the Dominator due to the violence it can cause. Upon the release of the film First Inspector, Kaji said that his impression of Arata is that he is a man who believes in the potential of humans and noted he cares for his teammates, the Reinforcers as seen through his actions across the anime. He was satisfied with the cast he worked with and claims he was interested in the character of Kariya who is one of the main focus on the movie. Shiotani claimed that Kaji's work as Shindo was remarkably good. However, he was afraid by the amount of lines he had to say in comparison to the other members from the cast. Ignatov's voice actor, Y≈´ichi Nakamura, also enjoyed the dynamic between Shindo and his character and wished the two were brothers. The handling of the characters' relationships with their underlings also appealed to him. Nakamura had no clear understanding of Shindo and Ignatov because their pasts are not explored in the early episodes and he looked forward to the development of the series. Appearances Shindo is introduced as one of two main protagonists of Psycho-Pass 3, which is set in a dystopian future and focuses on the use of the Sibyl System, a hive mind that uses public psychometric scanners that calculate the likelihood of a person committing a crime, resulting in a Crime Coefficient. Shindo is an Inspector for the Public Safety Bureau who investigates crime scenes and pursues individuals with high Crime Coefficient readings while controlling a hand-held weapon called a Dominator that is capable of stunning or destroying a target depending upon Sibyl's judgment. Shindo is a mentalist who has an ability called a that allows him to cross mental boundaries. He is also empathic and skilled in tracking his targets and understanding their states of mind. His use of this skill puts him at physical risk and causes him to hallucinate the image of a man with the head of a fox. It is later revealed he is also \\"Criminally Asymptomatic,\\" making it difficult for the Sibyl System to judge him because his Psycho-Pass is either low or non-existent. Shindo becomes an Inspector together with his childhood friend and fellow rookie Inspector, Kei Mikhail Ignatov. They have a strong bond and were the victims of a case that claimed the lives of Shindo's father and Ignatov's brother. In Psycho-Pass 3, Shindo and Ignatov serve under Chief Mika Shimotsuki who tends to be irritated by the duo's reckless actions, but allows them to proceed. The duo investigates crime scenes and focuses on a criminal organization known as Bifrost. Across the third season and sequel film, Shindo becomes the bodyguard of Tokyo governor, Karina Komiya. In the 2020 film, Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector, Shindo is kidnapped by terrorist Koichi Azusawa from Bifrost. With the help of Shion Karanomori and Komiya, he is released and continues to fight Bifrost's forces alongside his allies from Unit One. Along the way he learns that his father, Atsushi Shindo, is a member of the collective minds that comprise the Sibyl System and that Atsushi had his son's memories sealed off in order to allow the boy to grow up and to remain an individual. Shindo arrests Azusawa and is allowed to remain an Inspector and an individual with free will. Studio: Production I.G. Reception Critical response to Shindo has been positive. Ninotaku found him to be a well-developed character because he fits with the other characters created by Gen Urobuchi, especially Akane Tsunemori. Sequential Planet said the use of new protagonists was a risky movement for the franchise due to the popularity of Kogami and Tsunemori. Nevertheless, the site further stated that both Shindo and Ignatov are likeable characters, enjoying the former more for his cheerful personality, which contrasts with the series' dark narrative. Due to the focus the duo is given, the reviewer said Shindo and Ignatov are successors to Shinya Kogami. TheCinemaHolic wondered about Shindo's mentalist skills, saying although it might appear to be less realistic than the deductive skills employed by previous protagonists, it had the potential to be executed in a positive fashion in later episodes. Due to his portrayal, Shindo was compared to Steven Moffat's and Mark Gatiss's portrayals of Sherlock Holmes in the 2010s television series. TheCinemaHolic praised Shindo's and Igantov's roles in later episodes for the way they fit with the supporting characters. Shindo was also praised by Anime News Network for the way his mentalist skills added a new element to investigations and the air of mystery it gave to the new series. The same site noted that as more information about the two lead characters was revealed, the more their fate became chaotic, citing Shindo's hallucinations and the hidden aspects of his father's death. The focus given to Shindo and Ignatov in the finale also earned positive responses for the uncertainty created regarding whether or not they would betray their values. TheCinemaHolic stated that Shindo's Mental Trace added depth to his character though he might come across as ambiguous when analyzed and that he, too, underwent a notable character arc, becoming more mature with potential for further development. In a further analysis of the finale's narrative, the site agreed with Anime News Network regarding the handling of the duo in saying Ignatov was the more explored character of the pair because of the likely outcome of his final decision and its effect on his colleagues, especially Shindo. In regards to his role in First Inspector, Biggest in Japan praised the handling of Arata during the climax when he is judged by the Sybil System due to the parallels with Tsunemori and Shimotsuki in the past with Arata instead being judged as an equal while also praising his characterization for being close to the viewer as a result of being one of the few characters close to the audience when it comes to his conflict with Azusawa. Anime News Network also praised the interactions between Arata and Azusawa as rather than fighting physically, they both instead act accordingly to their morals.

The son of the Reverend William Barlow (son of Admiral Robert Barlow) and Louisa Adeane, he was born at Canterbury in February 1827. He was educated at Rugby School, before going up to St John's College, Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge, Barlow travelled to Brazil where he visited Pernambuco, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro and the Saint John d'El Rey Mining Company in order to learn about the language and trade of Brazil. After returning to England, Barlow joined the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry as a lieutenant in October 1852. In the same year he played first-class cricket for Manchester against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. He was dismissed without scoring in both innings by James Grundy. He was later promoted to captain in February 1860. Barlow travelled to the subcontinent in 1863, visiting India and Ceylon, before travelling to Burma to obtain a concession for a railway through Burma to China. By his own later account, he was introduced to the Burmese king, Mindon Min, who took an instant liking to him. According to Barlow, he was then appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Burmese army and made the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. After leaving Burma, he travelled to Abyssinia where he claimed to have become a major general in the Abyssinian Army. What is certain was his presence in Egypt in 1877, where he was captured and imprisoned by the Mahdist forces after landing on the Egyptian coast on a dhow which flew the Ottoman flag. His imprisonment raised questions in the Parliament of the United Kingdom regarding his treatment at the hands of the Mahdists. He later tried to accompany General Gordon on his ill-fated journey to Khartoum in 1885, but he was refused. Upon his return to England, Barlow's fortunes began to decline and he was declared bankrupt for the second time since 1867. He entered the Enfield Workhouse Infirmary in 1895, where he was to spend the remainder of his life in an apparent state of fantasy. Barlow was married to Elizabeth Isabella Haworth, with the couple having two children, however, it appears his financial troubles lead to the breakup of his family.

The film's music was jointly composed by Yakzan Gary Pereira and Neha Nair. In the plot, film actor Hareendran wants a driving licence urgently, his ardent fan and a Motor Vehicle Inspector, Kuruvila Joseph, agrees on delivering it illicitly, but their rendezvous does not go well, on the contrary, a feud develops between them that takes a toll on each other's personal and professional lives. Driving Licence was released in India on 20 December 2019 and internationally from 25 December 2019. The film met with a positive response from critics and was a commercial success at the box office. Plot Kuruvila Joseph, a Motor Vehicle Inspector (MVI) at Kakkanad RTO is a passionate fan of Malayalam film actor Hareendran. Hareendran is preparing to leave for the United States for his wife's diagnosis, delaying filming of his The Great Dictator which already incurred a budget overrun. With the climax still remaining to be shot at an Indian Navy leased land, the crew learns that Hareendran's driving licence that needs to be submitted to get clearance is missing. The producer is outraged as the film has to be wrapped as soon as possible. Due to a clerical error, Hareendran cannot apply for a duplicate licence. Issuing a new licence would take time. Hence, Hareendran's politician friend Peringodan meets Kuruvila for speeding the procedure, Kuruvila agrees to issue licence illicitly without Hareendran even attending the test, in return, he summons Hareendran to the RTO to meet him in person and as a proof in case of an inquiry. Meanwhile, Hareendran's professional rival Bhadran is plotting to suppress competition from Hareendran by means of occult. Even though he realises going to the RTO might give away clues for his visit, Hareendran hesitatingly agrees, hoping that an unadvertised visit calls for less visibility. On his arrival, he sees TV channels surrounding the premises, amidst, a peon gives a misinformation to a reporter that Hareendran, an avid driver, was driving without a licence until now. The news spreads. Inside the office, an infuriated Hareendran scolds Kuruvila in front of his son and superiors for the leak and leaves. Angered Kuruvila inform reporters that Hareendran was arrogant and wanted a licence without going through the normal procedures. Hareendran's reputation has been severely damaged. To worsen the situation, Bhadran's fans community head, Saheer, organises a hit-and-run attack on Kuruvila; at midnight, a masked gang cast stones at his house and Kuruvila's son suffers head injury. Kuruvila believes it is Hareendran's men. Meanwhile, Hareendran reluctantly cancels his US trip on the producer's insistence. While rushing his son to the hospital, a frustrated Hareendran calls Kuruvila by phone and threatens him, that affirms Kuruvila's conviction. On police inquiry, Kuruvila and wife accuses Hareendran. But Hareendran is not charged as his involvement was inconclusive. Protesting it, Kuruvila and family performs Satyagraha in front of Hareendran's residence, where media and fans also assemble. Amidst, a drunkard named Agasthi is trying to meet Hareendran but denied entrance. Addressing media, Hareendran states that Kuruvila is a crazy fan and a kind of stalker who finds gratification by being a part in his idol's life through disruption. He shows Kuruvila's fan messages as evidence and announces that he has decided to attend the test in the supervision of Kuruvila. Hareendran gets permission for an open test, which can be viewed by media and can be telecast live, the computer-based test is replaced with a direct question-answer session with Kuruvila. Kuruvila asks difficult and unusual questions, still Hareendran manages to pass the learner's test.

Meanwhile, Hareendran's wife requires a surgery, a flight is charted to reach there as soon as the test is completed.

While Mexico doesn't have a long history of producing whisky, there has been a recent push to establish Mexico as a preeminent whisky country with a small group fostering the industry in the country. History Whisky production in Mexico is almost non-existent with the first real Mexican whisky being produced in 2013. This is mainly due to the popularity of other distilled drinks such as tequila and mezcal in the country with the majority of whisky consumed in Mexico being imports from other countries. Today, most of the Mexican whisky produced originates from Oaxaca in Sierra Norte where heirloom corn is used due to its distinct taste from regular GMO corn. Despite the fact that the Mexican industry is relatively young, Mexican whisky has seen a rapid growth in popularity thanks in part to millennials who actively seek out new and different products and have helped to push the awareness of the country's whisky. The popularity of heirloom corn in the production has also helped it to become more in demand despite the rise of cheaper, mass-produced corn. In 2019, the first ever distillery dedicated entirely to the production of Mexican whisky, Destileria y Bodega Abasolo, was completed in Jilotepec de Abasolo ‚Äîabout 1.5 hours outside of Mexico City.

John Capodistria presents two plans for the land border: # Arta‚ÄìVolos line and 3.5 km north of the Gulf of Arta # The Haliacmon‚ÄìMetsovo‚ÄìIonian Sea line (Haliacmon-Ao√∂s line) According to the London Protocol (1829), the land border to the north is established on the Arta‚ÄìVolos line. The British strongly opposed the border in western Greece due to their interest in keeping the mainland opposite the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands away from Greek hands, lest it encourage irredentionist aspirations in the islands. The subsequent London Protocol (1830), however, returned the land border to the Aspropotamos‚ÄìSpercheios line.

Due to harassment and violence, including during (9‚Äì10 November 1938), ninety percent of the Jews had already left the Sudetenland by mid-1939. The remaining Jews were subject to property confiscation and eventually deportation. During the later years of the war, tens of thousands of Jews and non-Jews were forced laborers in a network of concentration camps in the Sudetenland. After the war, Jewish communities in the former Sudetenland suffered losses due to the discrimination against German-speaking Jews under the postwar Czechoslovak government, but were partially replenished by arrivals from Carpathian Ruthenia. Background  Synagogue in Teplitz- Sch√∂nau (Teplice), the largest Jewish community in the Sudetenland. Destroyed during . Before 1918, the German-majority parts of the Czech lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the nineteenth century, the Czech National Revival agitated for autonomy for the Czech-speaking majority. Following World War I, the border Sudetenland and its German majority were denied a border poll to determine their future. Even though most Germans would have preferred union with Germany, they became part of the new country of Czechoslovakia. The Jewish population of the Sudetenland had been decreasing due to emigration and a low birth rate. In 1930, the Jewish population of the area to be annexed by Germany in 1938 was 29,045, with 24,505 in what would be the Reichsgau Sudetenland Nazi administrative region. The largest Jewish communities were Teplitz-Sch√∂nau (Teplice, 3,213 Jews, 10% of the population), Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary, 2,115, 9%), and Reichenberg (Liberec, 1,392, 3.6%). Jews of the Sudetenland were small businessmen and professionals; they included wealthy industrialists such as the Petschek family. While some declared Jewish nationality, nearly all spoke German as their main language and most considered themselves Germans. Unhappy with their minority status despite relatively generous minority rights, Germans in Czechoslovakia started a movement for greater national autonomy. The resurgence of ethnic nationalism based on the idea of (\\"people's community\\") led to an increase in antisemitism as Jews were not deemed members of the national community. Economic difficulties in the mid-1930s caused an increase in support for the Sudeten German Party (SdP) of Konrad Henlein. A pro-Nazi party, SdP opposed liberalism, democracy, Slavs and Jews. Funded by the Nazi Party, it won two- thirds of the German vote in the 1935 Czechoslovak parliamentary election and about ninety percent in the 1938 Czechoslovak local elections. Prior to 1938, however, the SdP had emphasized the conflict between Czech and German nationalism rather than antisemitism. Annexation and flight Partition of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939 Reichsgau Sudetenland was established on some of the territory annexed by Germany in 1938. In September 1938, Henlein formed the (Sudeten German Free Corps) to conduct guerilla war against Czechoslovakia. Jewish-owned businesses in Eger (Cheb), Karlsbad, and Asch (A≈°) were attacked, although involvement has never been proven. Many Jews fled the violence: Warnsdorf (Varnsdorf) and Komotau (Chomutov), which had hundreds of Jewish residents in the 1930 census, declared themselves before the end of September. Due to the violence against Austrian Jews after the in March 1938, the Jews of the Sudetenland were aware of the dangers of Nazi rule. On 30 September 1938, the Munich Agreement was signed without Czechoslovak participation, ceding the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. Between 1 and 10 October, the Czechoslovak Army withdrew. The ‚Äîgreeted by most Germans as liberators‚Äîtemporarily set up a military administration, while Henlein was appointed . In between the departure of the Czechoslovak authorities and the arrival of the German ones, SdP supporters and the unleashed \\"unbridled terror\\" with acts of violence and vandalism against Jews and Czechs; Jewish businesses‚Äîespecially in Aussig (√öst√≠ nad Labem)‚Äîwere targeted again. In the wake of the German invasion force, units followed, to become the main instrument of Nazi repression as they had done after the , according to lists of anti-Nazis already developed by the SD (). The Gestapo office in Eger reported 971 arrests by 14 October, and the Karlsbad office reported 1,157 arrests by 7 November. Although Jews were not explicitly targeted as a group, many were arrested as political offenders. Many of the people arrested (10,000 by early 1939) were held in detention centers in the Sudetenland, while thousands were deported to concentration camps in Germany. Many Jews who had not already fled, often those elderly or with significant property that they did not wish to abandon, were visited by the Gestapo shortly after the German invasion and forced to sign papers promising to leave within six days. The authorities were encouraged to search the residence of all Jews for \\"subversive material\\" and \\"stolen goods\\". Many Jews fled with nothing more than personal valuables and sometimes machines from factories that they owned. German authorities sought to use the refugees, who mostly fled to the rump Czechoslovak state, to destabilize that state and increase antisemitism among Czechs. Some refugees were sent back by the Czechoslovak authorities and had to wait in the no-man's land for their cases to be resolved, despite the fact that the Munich Agreement entitled them to retain their Czechoslovak citizenship. Destruction to shops in Magdeburg after During (9‚Äì10 November 1938), Jews and Czechs were attacked and their stores raided. Most synagogues‚Äîincluding those in Teplitz-Sch√∂nau, Reichenberg, Troppau (Oprava), J√§gerndorf (Krnov), Falkenau (Sokolov) and Br√ºx (Most)‚Äîwere destroyed; others, such as those in Aussig and Tetschen (Dƒõƒç√≠n), were damaged with smashed windows. Jewish communities were billed for the cost of demolishing the synagogues that were damaged beyond repair. Perpetrators included SdP members, SS (), SA (), and local Germans. The number of Jews who were killed is unknown. In the wake of the pogrom, more Jews were arrested, detained either in temporary \\"wild camps\\" or deported to the Old Reich. At least 12,000 Jews had fled the Sudetenland by the beginning of November. By May 1939 only 2,363 \\"full Jews\\" (ten percent of the pre-war population) remained in the Reichsgau Sudetenland, along with 2,183 first-degree and 1,396 second-degree . On 14 March 1939, the Slovak State declared independence with German support. Carrying out plans made since October 1938, Germany invaded the Czech rump state, establishing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Most refugees from the Sudetenland therefore fell under Nazi rule. Those who did not manage to emigrate were deported from the Protectorate, especially in the first transports to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto. A month later, Adolf Hitler signed an edict establishing the Reichsgau Sudetenland, which included the northern part of the lands annexed by Germany in 1938. Other areas were annexed to existing Nazi German administrative regions, including Lower Bavaria, Oppeln (in Upper Silesia), and former Austrian areas. Aryanization Jewish-owned factory in Teplitz-Sch√∂nau On 14 October 1938, Hermann G√∂ring issued an edict for the Aryanization of Jewish property, which affected the entire Reich, including the newly annexed Sudetenland. Within weeks, Jews were forbidden from raising the German flag, from working as journalists, and from operating retail stores. Following , they were required to pay a 20% tax on all assets, and in December, the Nuremberg Laws were extended to the Sudetenland. Jews were required to declare their assets by 31 January 1939. In 1930, Jews had owned some four to five thousand businesses in the Sudetenland, providing employment for many residents in the region. Fleeing Jews abandoned hundreds of them, which were immediately taken over by the authorities and turned over to new owners. Nevertheless, the transition caused considerable chaos; in Teplitz- Sch√∂nau, where Jews had owned 89 of the 213 businesses, 200 stores were empty and work in most of the expropriated businesses must have ceased. Aryanization was characterized by conflicts between local Sudeten Germans and the : the former wanted to preserve jobs at Jewish-owned factories, while the latter sought to use Aryanization in order to leverage the Sudeten economy for war production. As a result, local Germans were mostly allowed to Aryanize factories in the textile and food sectors, which were mostly outdated, while Germans from elsewhere were invited to take over factories in industries important to the war effort. This result fueled resentment to the Sudeten Germans, who had hoped to reap the profits of the expropriations, which they considered just recompense for perceived suffering under the Czechoslovak government. Despite their disappointment, however, the Sudeten Germans had benefited from Aryanization, which their widespread participation in local government had accelerated. The total annexation of the Sudetenland to the Reich and the flight of the Jewish population enabled the process to proceed faster than elsewhere, and it was mostly complete by the end of 1939. The total amount of money obtained by Aryanization was estimated at 1 billion Reichsmarks, worth around USD$250 million at the time or $4.5 billion in 2019 dollars. Forced labor By 1939, Jews over the age of 14 were required to work at forced labor projects, even though their numbers were not enough to stem the local labor shortage. Due to low numbers, not a single forced-labor camp for local Jews was set up in the Sudetenland, despite the extensive systems that existed elsewhere. Exploitation of the forced labor of non-German Jews by Organization Schmelt became a major profit center for the SS. At the beginning of 1943, nineteen of 177 Schmelt camps were located in the Sudetenland; detainees were housed under conditions similar to those in the concentration camps. In late 1942, more than a thousand Jewish women were employed in the textile industry in Kreis Trautenau. In Postelberg, near Saatz, a forced-labor camp existed from 1943 to 1945, and in December 1944, two forced-labor camps were set up near Komotau. Both camps housed Jewish men from Prague protected from deportation by mixed marriages, the non-Jewish husbands of Jewish women from the Protectorate, and from the Protectorate. Former crematorium at Leitmeritz concentration camp In 1942, the first subcamps of Flossenb√ºrg, Ravensbr√ºck and Gross-Rosen were established in the Sudetenland, many of them derived from the system of Organization Schmelt. The system was greatly expanded during late 1944 because Sudetenland was one of the last areas to be relatively safe from Allied bombing and therefore favored for the relocation of war industry. In particular, it was home to many of the subcamps of Flossenb√ºrg, which itself was just over the pre-war border in the Upper Palatinate of Bavaria. One of the largest subcamps in the Sudetenland was Leitmeritz, a subcamp of Flossenb√ºrg organized by the (fighter staff) for aircraft and other armaments production. It had around 18,000 prisoners (including 3,600 Jews), 4,500 of whom died. Seven Gross-Rosen female subcamps in the Sudetenland contained 4,000 Jewish women. Thousands of Jews arrived at these camps in the last year of the war, both Hungarian Jews deported during the summer of 1944 and other Jews from the evacuation transports from Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, and other concentration camps in 1945. Extensive death marches took place in northern Bohemia in the last weeks of the war, delivering 12,829 prisoners to Theresienstadt from mid-April. Concentration and deportation In 10 May 1939, a law was passed to encourage landlords to evict Jewish tenants. Later that year, the system of \\"\\" () was set up and eventually extended to most towns with more than a few Jews. About 100 Jews from Aussig were forced to settle in Sch√∂nwald Castle, and dozens of Jews from Leitmeritz (Litomƒõ≈ôice) were moved to Dlaschkowitz Castle. As in the Old Reich, in late 1939 Jews were required to use the first names \\"Israel\\" or \\"Sarah\\", and from 1 September 1941, Jews were required to wear a yellow star. Many Jews attempted to subvert these measures, either by applying for an exception, or covering up the star. Jews were banned from traveling on trains in order to restrict their movement, and Jewish children were barred from schools. The Aryan partners in mixed marriages also endured discrimination. By June 1940, there were 1,886 Jews in the Reichsgau, and by April 1942 this had dropped further to 1,614. Deportation began on 13 July 1942 with a transport from Aussig, later than elsewhere in the Reich. Between July and February the next year, 400 people were deported directly to extermination camps in Eastern Europe. The second wave of transports deported another 460 people to Theresienstadt Ghetto in the Protectorate, from 13 November 1942 through the end of 1944. By 1 January 1945, 382 Jews remained in Reichsgau Sudetenland: 53 in non-privileged mixed marriages, 275 in privileged mixed marriages, 52 , and two Jews with foreign citizenship. Beginning in January 1945, the Reich Main Security Office planned the deportation of these Jews; 157 were deported to Theresienstadt between 6 February and 7 March. Of the 612 Jews deported to Theresienstadt in total, 366 died and 246 survived. Of the dead, 85 were killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau, two in Bergen-Belsen, and one person at Treblinka extermination camp. Aftermath Although postwar Czechoslovak law deemed all Aryanization transactions invalid, Jewish survivors faced difficulties in regaining their property. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia opposed restitution, preferring instead to nationalize businesses. Those who had declared German nationality on the 1930 census were stripped of their citizenship and had to reapply for it; in the meantime, they were completely ineligible for restitution or any social benefits, leaving many mired in poverty. Sudeten Germans are deported from Czechoslovakia after the war. About ninety percent of the three million Germans from the Czech lands were deported during the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Jews who had lost their citizenship were also to be expelled as Germans. Due to both official and unofficial discrimination, thousands of Jews applied to leave the country voluntarily. The deportation of Jews was abruptly halted in September 1946 due to unfavorable media coverage and objections from the military governor of the American occupation zone of Germany. Jewish communities in the former Sudetenland were repopulated by some of the 8,000 Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia part of Czechoslovakia before 1939, it was annexed to Soviet Ukraine in 1945. The Carpathian Jews, who represented 40% of the postwar Jewish population in Bohemia, were numerically dominant in the former Sudetenland. Religiously, they tended to be Orthodox Jews in contrast with the German Jews who favored Reform Judaism, and tended to hold separate services.

The team has also competed in the ARCA Menards Series East in the past. History =ARCA Menards Series East= Rohrbaugh's family team made their first NASCAR starts in 2014 in what was then the K&N; Pro Series East while also competing full-time in the X-1R Pro Cup Series that year. With his grandfather Larry Berg as the listed owner, the team fielded the No. 05 Toyota in three races: Five Flags, New Hampshire, and Dover. Their best finish was in their debut at Five Flags, where Rohrbaugh finished 13th. They returned for another part-time schedule in 2015, switching numbers from the No. 05 to the No. 7 and manufacturers from Toyota to Chevrolet. The team ran New Hampshire and Dover again, and also for the first time attempted New Smyrna, Bristol, and Richmond. The other race they entered that year was the East Series‚Äô first and to-date only race at Motordrome Speedway, where Rohrbaugh and his team earned their first top-10 with a 9th place finish. The team attempted five East Series races the following year. They attempted mostly the same schedule, but with Motordrome and Richmond off the schedule for 2016, they attempted the new race at Mobile instead. Rohrbaugh crashed out in two of his five starts and finished in the top-20 (two 19ths and a 13th) in his remaining races. =ARCA Menards Series= In addition to their K&N; East races in 2016, Rohrbaugh's team made their ARCA debut that year, running the last two races of the year at Kentucky and Kansas. Exactly the same as how he did in his first East Series start, Rohrbaugh finished 13th in his ARCA Series debut. However, Rohrbaugh did not finish the race at Kansas due to electrical issues and ended up 32nd. For 2017, Rohrbaugh and his No. 7 team attempted an expanded schedule of eight races in ARCA after dropping their K&N; program. The team ran Chevrolets in all races, except for Daytona and Talladega that they ran Dodges. Rohrbaugh finished every race no worse than 16th except for when he crashed out at Chicago, finishing 29th. His best finishes were a pair of 8th-place runs at Michigan and Kansas. The team started out the 2018 season now driving a Chevrolet SS but crashed at Daytona and rebuilt the same car in time to attempt Talladega. At the ARCA Daytona test in January 2019, Rohrbaugh announced he would compete in all the speedway races that year. However, Rohrbaugh eventually decided to focus on the Truck Series team, and they cut back their ARCA schedule for the rest of the 2019 season. Eric Caudell bought the team's owner points and switched his team's car number from the No. 2 to the No. 7, which Rohrbaugh's team had been running. For 2020, the team returned to ARCA, entering a car in the series' testing at January in January with newcomer Jason Kitzmiller driving the No. 97 (since Caudell was continuing to use the No. 7). The team then filed an entry for the race there in February. The team has yet to announce whether they will attempt more races throughout the year after Daytona. =NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series= Rohrbaugh did qualify for the race in his and the team's first Truck Series attempt, at Bristol in 2018. As Korbin Forrister's team was already using the No. 7, they picked the No. 9 to use for their Truck Series team. They finished with a top-20 in their first race (16th) in No. 9 Chevrolet Silverado. Returning for the race at Texas in November, now driving a Ford truck, Rohrbaugh was able to make the race again, and he impressively picked up another top-20, finishing 17th. The team did announce they would be attempting Homestead-Miami Speedway, but they changed their mind in order to focus on preparing for the ARCA season-opener at Daytona in 2019. Returning in 2019, CR7M attempted twelve races, about half of the season, and all with Rohrbaugh as the driver. The team used Chevrolet Silverados in all races they attempted. Rohrbaugh qualified for nine of twelve races. His DNQ's came at Daytona, Martinsville in March, and Bristol. He crashed in each of the first three races he did qualify for, which were at both Texas races (in March and June) and Charlotte. His other DNF that year came when he was involved in the big one at Talladega. Despite not qualifying for some of his races and not finishing in others, he scored a top-10 finish in the second Martinsville race in October. Also in 2019, the team worked with three different crew chiefs. They started the year with Michael Shelton before he left to crew chief the No. 46 Kyle Busch Motorsports team. Their general manager and ARCA team crew chief Mark Huff worked with the truck team for the first Martinsville race. They then picked up Doug George, who came over after starting the season with the Niece Motorsports No. 44 team.

Despite proving outstanding in trials, engine supply curtailed its production. Design and development The low- wing Moskalyev SAM-10 was a development of the wooden, high cantilever wing SAM-5bis-2. Its wings, as well as the rear fuselage and tail, were originally built for the SAM-5bis-2. They had twin spars with plywood skin around the leading edge and fabric covering aft. The SAM-10 was powered by a Bessonov MM-1, a six cylinder. air-cooled, inverted inline engine, though its unobtainability led to the SAM-10bis, fitted instead with a Voronezh MV-6, a similar six cylinder engine. The engine cowling was light alloy, as were the cabin roof frames, but the rest of the fuselage had a wooden structure, the forward part covered with ply and the rest with fabric. At the rear, the fin was triangular, carrying a narrower, round-tipped rudder. Its cantilever tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage. The undercarriage was fixed and conventional with mainwhels on oleo struts, enclosed in aerofoil section trouser fairings, and a skid under the tail. Operational history The date of the SAM-10s first flight is not known but it underwent two months of official tests from early June 1938. Its outstanding performance resulted in orders for both passenger and ambulance configurations but the unavailability of its engine blocked production. In response, two SAM-10bis, powered by the more available but less powerful MV-6 and with unaltered dimensions but one less seat, were built. The reduced power reduced performance, for example, the time taken to reach rose from 2.7 to 3.2 minutes; no further orders were forthcoming.

Research and career  Cottingham studies the dynamics of lake plankton communities and relationships between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. She joined the faculty at Dartmouth College in 1998. She has studied the reasons that cyanobacteria bloom occur, and the consequences of them blooming in low nutrient clear-water lakes. She has investigated ways to manage the growth of these blooms and mitigate the negative impacts of them on ecosystems. Cottingham showed that cyanobacterial blooms create their own optimised environments, driving nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in otherwise low nutrient lakes. She has started work with computer scientists to use big data and artificial intelligence to understand cyanobacteria across the East Coast. Data will be collected using robotic boats, buoys and drones equipped with cameras. Cottingham also works on environmental health, in particular the occurrence of arsenic in food and drinking water. Her 2012 research on pregnant women's rice consumption and arsenic exposure was selected by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) as one of the most important papers of the year. She identified that women who ate rice had considerably higher urinary arsenic concentrations than those who did not consume rice. She went on to show that white wine, beer, Brussels sprouts and salmon significantly increased arsenic levels in humans. = Academic service = From 2017 to 2019 Cottingham served as a National Science Foundation Program Director in the Division of Environmental Biology. She returned to Dartmouth College in 2019. Cottingham is involved with several public engagement projects, including acting as Vice Chair of the Science Advisory Boards of the Lake Sunapee Protective Association and Jefferson Project at Lake George.  Awards and honours  * 2015 Elected Fellow of the Ecological Society of America * 2019 Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  Selected publications   * Cottingham is the Editor-in-Chief of Ecology.

Kitab al-Tawhid is monumental work which very nicely expounded the tenets and beliefs of the Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jama'a and refuted the stands of the opponents, such as Karramites, Mu'tazilites, Qadariyya, Majus, Sophists, Dualisms, and Christians. This work is providing a detailed and holistic approach to Islamic theology, whilst also being its earliest extant comprehensive source. Al-Maturidi presents the epistemological foundations of his teaching and provides detailed arguments in defence of Monotheism, including his cosmological doctrines - such as proofs for the creation and ontology of the Universe. He also focuses on God, His existence and attributes, analyzing issues related to anthropomorphism and rationalism amongst many others.  Editions  The book was edited by Bekir Topaloƒülu and Muhammed Aru√ßi and published twice by ƒ∞SAM Publications (2000 and 2003). The third impression was made in Beirut in 2007.  Awards  The book is awarded with the 16th World Prize for \\"the Book of the Year\\" in the field of Islamic studies by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2008. The editors of the book, Bekir Topaloƒülu and Muhammed Aru√ßi, are invited by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to Iran on this occasion. In the convention organized on February 7, 2009, the prize of \\"the Book of the year\\" in Muslim theology was granted to the winners by the President Mahmud Ahmadinejad.  Authenticity  Joseph Schacht, in his article that announces the discovery of Kitab al-Tawhid, described the Cambridge manuscript as an authentic book by al-Maturidi. Meanwhile, the one surviving manuscript of Kitab al-Tawhid was published by Fathallah Khalif in 1970, and research by students of Islamic theology began based on it. Several reviews and studies of it were done, too.

Born into a family of Parisian shopkeepers, he entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1849 at the age of seventeen, where he studied under (1810‚Äì79). He made his debut at the Paris Salon of 1859. Worms is best known for genre scenes depicting Spanish life, often comical and painted in a highly realistic manner with many details and bright colors. Career Novillada dans la province de Valence, 1866, . In the early 1860s, Worms made his first trip to Spain, where he was immediately enchanted with Spanish culture and customs. Worms returned for six extended trips between 1860‚Äì61 and 1882, traveling widely and gathering sketches and costumes for studio paintings back in Paris.Sanders, Patricia B. The Haggin Collection, Stockton: The Haggin Museum, 1991, p 162. In 1871 he spent six months in Granada with the Catalan painter Mari√† Fortuny, whom he had met in Paris.

Laurel Weldon is a Canadian and American political scientist, currently a Distinguished Professor of Political Science at Simon Fraser University. She is a democratic and feminist theorist, known for studies of the cross-national evolution of women's rights, policies on the prevention of violence against women, and the inclusion of women in political decision-making. Weldon's work has been noted for contributing to both substantive political theory and empirical methods. Education Weldon's mother, Sirje Weldon, was the Atlantic regional director for the Canadian Bankers Association, and her father, K. Laurence Weldon, was a professor of mathematics and statistics at Simon Fraser University. Weldon attended Simon Fraser University, graduating in 1991 with a BA in political science and sociology and a minor in philosophy. She then completed an MA in political science at the University of British Columbia in 1992, and a PhD in political science at the University of Pittsburgh in 1999, where she was advised by Iris Marion Young. Career After graduating with a PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, Weldon moved to Purdue University in 1999. She soon published the 2002 book Protest, Policy and the Problem of Violence Against Women, as well as a series of widely cited cross-national studies on violence against women and women's political participation. In 2011, Weldon published the book When Protest Makes Policy: How Social Movements Represent Disadvantaged Groups, which studied the role of social movements in democracy through several case studies on American social movements. This work provided evidence that social movements can be an effective means for systematically disadvantaged groups to promote their collective aims, and that in some cases strong social movements can provide more effective safeguards against negative political outcomes than the official inclusion of group members in formal institutions like legislatures. The book won the American Political Science Association's 2012 Victoria Schuck Award for the best book published on women and politics. In 2013, Weldon was a co-editor of the first Oxford Handbook on Politics and Gender. Weldon's third book was coauthored with Mala Htun and published in 2018; in The Logics of Gender Justice: State Action on Women‚Äôs Rights Around the World, Weldon and Htun studied the evolution of women's rights issues such as family law, abortion, paid parental leave, and contraception from 1975 to 2005. Weldon and Htun received the Human Rights Best Book Award for 2019 from the International Studies Association. Weldon has been a consultant for international organisations including the United Nations and the World Bank. She has also been a lead reviewer for selective political science journals: she is part of the 2020-2024 editorial leadership of the American Political Science Review, and was a founding co-editor of the Western Political Science Association journal Politics, Groups, and Identities. Weldon's work has been noted for contributing to diverse subfields, particularly for developing political theory while also contributing new ideas in how to study political phenomena with rigorous empirical methods. In 2018, Weldon moved to Simon Fraser University from Purdue University, where she had been a Distinguished Professor and the Director of the Purdue Policy Research Institution.

History  The first documents relating to the presence of the Carabinieri within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs date back to 1946. However, the history of the Carabinieri Foreign Ministry Command dates back to 1979. Before the establishment of the dedicated Carabinieri organisation of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, two Carabinieri units with duties related to the foreign affairs functioned: the Carabinieri MAE detachment, which performed duties of surveillance, security, cypher, and courier service, and the Carabinieri Emigration Unit, assigned to the emigration affairs. Until 1963, the units were at the disciplinary dependencies of the Carabinieri Legion of Rome, when they were transferred to the Special Units Department. = 1979 - 1989 = The \\"Carabinieri Unit of Foreign Affairs\\" was established on 15 September 1979, pursuant to Law No. 838 of 27 December 1973. The Unit was placed under the functional dependencies of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and under the disciplinary dependencies of the Carabinieri Legion of Rome. The Unit was organised on a Command Nucleus, a Surveillance Nucleus, a Security Nucleus and an Emigration Nucleus on which six Sub-nucleus depended. On 15 February 1982 the Unit was reorganised. The Security Nucleus passed under the command of the Commander of the Emigration Nucleus and the latter also assumed the role of Deputy Commander. On 1 May 1982, the Unit, now commanded by a Colonel, was initially placed within the VI Brigade; subsequently, on 15 November 1987, it passed under the XII Brigade, assuming the current name of Carabinieri Command Ministry of Foreign Affairs. = 1989 - 2000 = From 3 November 1992, the Command was attributed to the command of a Brigadier General. On 1 September 1996 the Command was reorganised. A Command Office and a Security and Surveillance Office were established. The Command Office included an Operations and Logistics Section and a Secretariat and Personnel Section, while the Security and Surveillance Office was divided into a Headquarters team and a Foreign team. In 1998, the Security and Surveillance Office was transformed into a Unit and organised into two sections. In 1999, the Command was placed under the functional dependencies of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, through the Secretary-General of the Ministry. = 2001 ‚Äì present = In 2001, with the transformation of the Carabinieri into an autonomous Service, the XII Brigade was transformed into the Carabinieri Specialist Units Division. On 1 January 2004, while remaining at the disciplinary dependence of the Specialist Units Division, the leadership of the Carabinieri Ministry of Foreign Affairs Command was assigned to a Division General. On 1 December 2009, the Command passed under the direct command of the Specialists and Mobile Units Command. On 1 April 2016, a secretariat was set up, reporting directly to the Commander.

William Spotswood Green (1847‚Äì1919), who explored, mapped, named, climbed, and wrote about the Selkirk Mountains. His book \\"Among the Selkirk Glaciers\\", published in 1890, introduced the world to the Selkirk Mountains. He is credited with recommending the location for a small chalet to the Canadian Pacific Railway that would grow to become the Chateau Lake Louise hotel, as well as making the first ascent of Mount Bonney.R.

The original gun is now on display at the Mus√©e des Archives Nationales in Paris, France. Design Described as a \\"supergun\\", the infernal machine was designed to fire 25 rifle barrels at the same time. Each barrel was originally believed to have been loaded with eight bullets and twenty lead pellets, but a thorough inspection of the misfired barrels by Jean Le Page, Arquebusier Ordinaire to the King, showed that each barrel contained about of gunpowder, 6 to 8 balls, two layers of wadding, and 13 to 14 slugs. The weapon, built of wood and metal, was constructed in a room overlooking the street on the third floor of N. 50 Boulevard du Temple, where it was later used for the failed assassination of Louis Philippe I. The barrels were mounted side-by-side with each touch hole in line with the next. In combination with a trail of gunpowder, the barrels could all be fired at once with a single fuse (in Fieschi's case, charcoal was used). The weapon was measured by Le Page to be approximately in length and width and high. French artillery officers, who inspected the machine after the assassination attempt, speculated that if Fieschi had been an artillery man or otherwise known more about designing weaponry, he would have been successful in his assassination attempt of the king and his staff. Had he constructed it so that the gunfire diverged and crossed as opposed to the parallel and converging implementation, the attack might have killed up to 200 additional people and \\"literally torn the King and his staff to pieces\\". Failed assassination attempt Louis Philippe I of France on July 28, 1835 On July 28, 1835, Fieschi attempted to assassinate King Louis Philippe I using the infernal machine. The gun was positioned on the windowsill in Fieschi's three-room lodging on the third floor of N. 50 Boulevard du Temple in Paris, overlooking the street on the route that the king and his convoy were expected to take as part of the yearly Paris National Guard inspection. When the convoy was passing directly below, Fieschi, waiting in ambush, fired the infernal machine. The gun fired a volley of approximately 400 projectiles, even though four barrels misfired, four barrels burst, and one of the 25 barrels was not loaded as it did not have a touch hole and could not be fired. The king only suffered a graze to the forehead, a minor injury,Harsin, Jill (2002), p.148 but 18 people were either immediately killed or later succumbed to their wounds. An additional 22 people were injured, and at least four of these had limbs amputated due to the severity of their injuries. When he fired the weapon, Fieschi suffered severe wounds to his head, face, and hand.Harsin, Jill (2002), p.149 He fled from his lodgings and was later captured by authorities after they followed the trail of blood from his injuries. It was believed that Fieschi could have successfully escaped had he not been injured by the gun's discharge.

Old, Middle and New Kingdoms =Bunsen= In his 1844‚Äì57 √Ñgyptens Stelle in der Weltgeschichte, Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen became the first Egyptologist to propose what became the modern \\"tri-partite division\\" for Egypt's history: * Altes Reich (\\"Old Empire\\") = Menes until the beginning of the 13th Dynasty * Mittleres Reich (\\"Middle Empire\\") = Hyksos until the 17th Dynasty * Neues Reich (\\"New Empire\\") = from the 18th Dynasty onward Bunsen explained, in the English translation of his 1844 work, how he came to derive the three Kingdoms:Egypt's place in universal history: an historical investigation in five books, pages xiii and 42 > In 1834 I discovered in the list of Eratosthenes the key to the restoration > of the first 12 Dynasties of Manetho, and was thereby enabled to fix the > length of the Old Empire.

The Campaign was launched in April 2007. National Close the Gap Day (NCTGD) has been held annually since 2009. History The Close the Gap campaign arose in response to Professor Tom Calma‚Äôs Social Justice Report (2005), PDF in which he described the social factors underlying the health inequality in Australia, and challenged governments to bring parity within a generation. In Australia, Aboriginal infants die more often than non-Indigenous infants, Aboriginal people's life expectancy is shorter, and they suffer more than double the rate of illness. Although these types of disparities exist in comparable countries such as the US and New Zealand, Australia has the worst figures. The Steering Committee first met in March 2006. Their campaign was launched in April 2007 by patrons Catherine Freeman and Ian Thorpe . 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. (Details here.) It began as the National Indigenous Health Equality Campaign, being formally introduced as Close the Gap in December 2007. More than 40 Indigenous and non-Indigenous health and human rights organisations collaborated to achieve health equality (measured as life expectancy) for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by 2030. In 2007 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) set measurable targets to track and assess developments in the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. These targets include achieving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health equality within a generation and halving the mortality rate gap for children under five years old within a decade. In February 2008, his Apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd pledged the government to bridge the gap between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australian health, education and living conditions, in a way that respects their rights to self-determination. He also proposed to establish a commission to \\"close the gap\\" between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in \\"life expectancy, educational achievement and economic opportunity\\". On 20 March 2008, about a month Rudd and then Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson, signed the Close the Gap Statement of Intent at the Close the Gap Campaign‚Äôs National Indigenous Health Equality Summit. PDF The Statement of Intent committed the government to: * Develop a comprehensive, long-term plan of action, targeted to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing the existing inequalities in health services, in order to achieve equality of health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non- Indigenous Australians by 2030. * Ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their representative bodies in all aspects of addressing their health needs. The Statement of Intent became the point of reference for the Close the Gap campaign. Over the years, a number of prominent Indigenous leaders have co-chaired the campaign, including: *Jody Broun, also a co-chair of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, and Mick Gooda, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, in 2013; *Kirstie Parker, who also co-chaired of the National Congress of Australia‚Äôs First Peoples, and Mick Gooda, in 2014; *Jackie Huggins, also co-chair for the National Congress of Australia‚Äôs First Peoples, and Pat Turner , CEO of National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, in 2017.

Publications Close the Gap has produced 11 reports, including a 10-year review in 2018. Closing the Gap The Australian government adopted the goals of Close the Gap in 2008, in a strategy known as Closing the Gap, and in 2009 committed to making an annual progress report to Parliament on progress with the Closing the Gap strategy. In 2020, the Closing the Gap framework and strategy was significantly overhauled, with a \\"greater focus on partnership between governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\\".

Designed by renowned naval architect Walter Reeks, Manly was the first double-ended screw ferry on the Manly run. She, along with Kuring-gai (1901), were the archetypes for the long run of Manly ferries for most of the twentieth century. Background In the 1880s, the Port Jackson Steamship Company Limited had been expanding its paddle steamer fleet and services to Manly from Sydney (Circular Quay). Without competition, fares also rose. In response, local interests set up the Manly Co-operative Steam Ferry Limited in 1893 that ran a service with chartered single-ended screw steamers. While a price-war ensued, the new company's smaller and open vessels (Cygnet, Admiral, Conqueror, and Marramarra) could not match Port Jackson's larger vessels, which included Brighton, Fairlight, Narrabeen. However, patronage for both companies increased significantly. To entice a bigger share of the expanding market, the Manly Co-op ordered an 700-passenger steamer to be named Emancipator. The company commissioned renowned naval architect Walter Reeks to design her. But by 1896, when the older company dropped prices to threepence return and the high cost of building the new Emancipator, the Manly Co-Op collapsed. The Port Jackson Co took over the Manly Co-op's interests (including the nearly completed Emancipator) and changed its name to Port Jackson Co-operative Steamship Co. Ltd. The name of the near complete \\"Emancipator\\" was dropped in favour of \\"Manly\\". Design and construction The new ferry boat was built by Young, Son & Fletcher in Balmain, New South Wales. She was a double-ended double-screw vessel of wooden-construction. A product of the competitive market and designed to capture the market, she was an innovative vessel. She became the archetype for the familiar Manly ferries throughout the twentieth century. She had high forecastles at either end to run at speed through the deep-sea conditions across the Sydney Heads. Her basic design was further refined with the subsequent steel and larger ferry Kuring-gai (1906), the six Binngarra-class vessels, culminating in the Scottish-built Dee Why and Curl Curl and South Steyne. Unlike her predecessors, Manly had two wheelhouses both placed immediately fore and aft of her funnel. She had an open promenade deck and an enclosed lower deck. She measured long (only two-thirds the length of Brighton) with a beam of . At 229 tons, she was approximately half the size of the Binngarra-type ferries. Her 100 hp engine, built by Fawcett, Preston and Company (of England), was the first triple expansion steam engines in a Manly ferry. Capable of over 14 knots, she could carry 820 passengers. Her wooden construction allowed the continuous propeller shaft to lose its alignment resulting in severe vibration. This was relieved when her three-bladed propellers were repalced with four-bladed ones. Service history SS Manly (1896) on Sydney Harbour (1905) Ordered by the Manly Co-op, she was to have been named Emancipator and she was not christened at her launch due to the merger negotiations following the Manly Co-o'ps failure. Two days after her launch, on the 14 of June 1896, the two competing companies began the process to amalgamate and shortly thereafter she received her name, \\"Manly\\". After a period of fitting out, Manly ran her trials on 30 October 1896 where she covered the measured mile in a little over 4 minutes, exceeding expectations. Her trials were run under Captain Clark of the Balmain Ferry Company. On 18 December, she collided with the collier Merksworth. Manly suffered no damage, but Merksworth's bridge and upper works were damaged from the overhanging bow of the ferry and Manly‚Äôs leading propeller had gouged a large hole in the collier‚Äôs hull. Merksworth managed to beach near Mosman Bay and no lives were lost. Captain Thomas Capuru, master of the Manly, was found to be at fault and his masters‚Äô certificate was suspended for three months. By the late 1890s, conditions on the Manly ferries were extremely crowded on weekends and holidays. No attempt was made to run the boats to a timetable, they simply loaded and ran. Following Christmas 1898, the masters of Fairlight and Manly both received fines for overcrowding. Crowd control was ineffective at both the Manly and Circular Quay wharves. As a result of this penalty, the ferry was equipped with iron gates ‚Äì something that would be standard on later ferries ‚Äì and turnstiles were erected at both wharves. With increasing demand and overcrowding, the Port Jackson Co ordered the first of what was to become the Binngarra-type vessels that were significantly larger and higher capacity. On the night of 30 June 1901, while Manly was crossing Sydney Heads in a gale with fifty passengers, heavy waves broke over her near South Head and the engines stopped and could not be restarted. Wallowing beam to the waves, she drifted towards North Head. The large paddle steamer, Brighton, towed Manly into North Harbour where she was safely beached and her engines were restarted. Brighton took her own passengers on to Manly wharf and returned to find the Manly grounded in the soft sand. A line was run from the Manly to the beach and the passengers were taken off four or five at a time through the heavy surf of Manly Cove. In 1904, she was involved in a fatal collision with the launch Agnes on Sydney Harbour. The 30 foot launch turned directly into the path of the Manly and the much larger Manly smashed into the launch sinking her. Two people drowned, a mother and father, leaving behind a family of four orphans who were rescued from the crash. An investigation placed the blame for the collision on the captain of the Agnes. The captain of the Manly was admonished for not sounding the steam whistle. Manly went on to lead a remaining quiet life. In 1922, she set a record time of 22 minutes for the trip to Manly, a time which has not been beaten by any conventional ferry since (hydrofoils did the run in 15 minutes). Decommissioning While Manly was innovative and fast, she was too small. Unlike the previous paddlers and subsequent Binngarra-type screw vessels, which were larger and a number of which could carry 1,500 passengers, her capacity of 820 was not enough for the crowds on the Manly run. With the introduction of the bigger Binngarra-type ferries, she was increasingly being used as spare boat only. When Baragoola was launched in 1922, the wooden Manly was laid up permanently. In early 1924, she was advertised for sale, eventually selling for six hundred pounds to W M Ford of Berrys Bay. In 1926, her engines were removed to be installed in the island trader Madal and she was broken up later that year.

Founded in 1916, it consists of 89 affiliated clubs on the Island of Ireland and acts as the official authority for the Irish variety of the sport. It solely controlled and administrated Greyhound racing in Ireland until the creation of the Irish Greyhound Board in 1958, however it still continues to do so in Northern Ireland. National Meetings The association holds two national meets, the National Meeting at the Clonmel Greyhound Stadium in County Tipperary in February, being the most important event in the coursing calendar, attracting 10,000 spectators, and claimed by its organisers to be worth up to ‚Ç¨16 million for the local economy, and the Irish Cup at the County Limerick Coursing Club a few weeks afterwards. Conservation A study in 2010 by Dr Neil Reid at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast found that the density of hares in ICC preserves was eighteen times higher than in the wild in Ireland. It is claimed by the ICC that without regulated coursing there would be an increase of unregulated illegal hunting. In July 2019, Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD2), a highly contagious disease nicknamed 'rabbit foot and mouth' which is fatal to Leporidae (rabbits and hares), was discovered in wild hares in County Clare, County Wexford and County Wicklow. As a result, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht suspended capture and tagging licences issued to the ICC and affiliated clubs. RHD2 was found in hares in the counties of Clare, Cork, Dublin, Kildare, Leitrim, Meath, Wexford and Wicklow. In August 2019, restrictions were lifted in areas outside of 25km radius prohibited zones surrounding discovery locations which was welcomed by the Club. Rules The rules and regulations appertaining to the Irish Coursing Club are stringent, with 178 sections in 9 parts, this is in addition to Acts introduced by the Law of the Republic of Ireland. Every greyhound bred in Ireland is required to have an Irish identity card and requires microchipping. The vast majority of greyhounds bred are either sold to owners within Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom or race in Greyhound racing in Ireland. The much smaller majority remain within coursing. The Greyhound Board of Great Britain do not allow registered owners to compete in coursing.

Enlisting in the warlord's army at the age of 13, Chen Geng joined the Communist Party of China in 1922 and was accepted to Whampoa Military Academy in 1924. He approached Chiang Kai-shek and even saved his life by preventing him from committing suicide. He served as a Communist spy in the National Revolutionary Army for 6 years. After being discovered, he joined the Communist base in Jiangxi and participated in the Long March. He fought the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War and then the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War. Once the victory obtained, he went to Vietnam to help H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh against the French during the First Indochina War and then participated in the Korean War with the People's Volunteer Army. He became a senior general in 1955. He then founded an academy of military technologies but died before finalizing the ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Biography Born in Xiangxiang, Hunan, Chen Geng is the second child in a sibling group of 12. His grandfather Chen Yihuai () was an officer in the Xiang Army led by Zeng Guofan, a statesman, military general, and Confucian scholar of the late Qing dynasty (1644-1911). After his retirement, Chen Yihuai bought agricultural land with the reward, and by the time Chen Geng was born, his family owned several hundred mu and became one of the wealthiest in the region. Chen's father named Chen Daoliang and his mother named Peng Xuexian. But as his only older brother dies young from illness, Chen becomes the eldest son of the family. At 13, his father arranged a marriage with a daughter two years older, but Cheng refused the marriage and left his family to join the warlord's army. It is a disillusioned Chen who left the army at 18 and found a job at the Hunan Railway Bureau as a receptionist. During this period, he met Mao Zedong. Chen joined the Communist Party of China in 1922 and studied at Whampoa Military Academy in 1924. Chen, , and , were considered the top three students of the academy at the time. Chen gained the confidence of Chiang Kai-shek and became commander of his garrison. In October 1925, during the second campaign against the local warlord Chen Jiongming, Chiang suffered a stunning, Chiang was covered with shame but refused to flee, trying to kill himself. Cheng Geng managed to take his pistol and forced him to leave the battlefield. He thus won Chiang's confidence more, however, when the Kuomintang broke ties with the Communists in 1927, Chen began to work as a mole for the Communists in Shanghai. In March 1933, Chen was sent to Shanghai to treat his leg wounds, but Chen was captured in Shanghai by the Kuomintang. But since he once saved Chiang Kai-shek's life, his life was spared. Chang ordered his transfer to house arrest and does not send him to prison. Chen escaped a month later with the help of Song Qingling and other Communists. He moved to Central Soviet Area and was appointed president of Peng Pai Yang Yin Infantry School (). From October 1934 to December1935, he fought against the Kuomintang army in Guizhou and then in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Gansu in 1936. In February 1937 he was accepted to Counter-Japanese Military and Political University. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chen was appointed commander-in-chief of the 386th Brigade, which he led in victories against the Imperial Japanese army, and his brigade was considered the best in China. In 1940, he led his brigade to Shanxi during Hundred Regiments Offensive. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Chen's brigade became the 4th Column of the Shanxi-Henan-Hebei-Shandong Military District. He led his troops in important battles of the Chinese Civil War such as the Shangdang Campaign, the Datong- Puzhou Campaign, Linfen‚ÄìFushan Campaign and L√ºliang Campaign, the Campaign of the eastern foothills of Funiu Mountain, and the Huaihai Campaign. The war ended and the 4th Column became the 4th Army Group, and Chen served as commander and political commissar. His troops entered Yunnan in 1949. At the request of Chen's longtime friend H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, he entered French Indochina to help V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p launch a series of attacks on isolated French bases along the Chinese border in 1950. Back from French Indochina, he left for the Korean War and served as commander and political commissioner of the 3rd Army Group of the People's Volunteer Army. When Commander Peng Dehuai returned to China, Chen temporarily took command. He was awarded the military rank of senior general in September 1955 by Chairman Mao Zedong. His brother-in-law, Tan Zheng, who was married to Chen's sister, Chen Qiuju, was strongly influenced by Chen to join the Communists and became a senior general at the same time. Returning from the Korean War, Chen founded the PLA Military Engineering Institute in Harbin, engaging in the development of technological weapons. The school became one of the most famous universities in China in a few years. Because of his experience, Chen focused on China's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program. He died of a heart attack in Shanghai, on March 16, 1961. Personal life In 1927 Chen married , who was killed in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Born during the decades following the Franco-Tahitian War (1844‚Äì1847), Teraupo'o was a lesser chief from the village of Avera, on the east coast of Raiatea. He grew to resent the French after being mistreated by an officer. After King Tamatoa VI of Raiatea submitted to French annexation, Teraupo'o refused to surrender and led the native resistance against the French and installed a resistance government under Tuarii as queen at Avera. He and his followers, dubbed the Teraupiste, included a majority of the natives of Raiatea and Tahaa. They fought off French colonial rule from 1887 until 1897 while attempting to convince the British to support their cause to remain independent. The French under Governor Gustave Gallet sent for reinforcement to quell the native resistance and defeated the native forces of Raiatea in battle and the subsequent guerilla campaign that followed. Teraupo'o was captured on the night of 15‚Äì16 February 1897. After he was defeated and captured, he was exiled to New Caledonia until 1905 when he was allowed to return to Raiatea. He lived out the rest of his life as a recluse and died in 1918 of the Spanish flu epidemic. Early life He was born in with the name Hapaitahaa a Etau, at Avera, a village on the east coast of the island of Raiatea in the Leeward Islands, a part of the larger Society Islands group. He also initially bore the name Taraiupo'o, meaning \\"Headhunter\\", while his later adopted name Teraupo'o, meaning \\"This Head\\" in the Tahitian language. Teraupo'o was considered a \\"chief of a minor lineage\\". The Society Islands were evangelized by British missionaries and converted to Protestant Christianity by the London Missionary Society (LMS) in the early 19th century. The ari'i rahi (supreme rulers) were early patrons of the British Protestants. By the mid-19th century, the adoption of a British parliamentary system of government eroded the traditional supremacy of the ari'i rahi in favor of the ra'atira (freemen) class. Local chiefs and tƒÅvana (district governors) gain greater power and autonomy at the expense of the nominal island monarchs especially in Raiatea- Tahaa. A decade before Teraupo'o's birth, the neighboring Kingdom of Tahiti had been subjugated under a protectorate in the Franco-Tahitian War (1844‚Äì1847) but the kingdoms of the Leeward Islands including Raiatea-Tahaa were ensured independence by France and Great Britain under the Jarnac Convention or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847. According to French historian Auguste Charles Eug√®ne Caillot, Teraupo'o grew to resent the French after he was kicked by a French captain or pilot in Raiatea. He allegedly received a kick from the officer in ‚Äúdans la partie la moins noble de son individu\\" (the least noble part of his person). French annexation In 1880, King Tahitoe of Raiatea accepted the provisional protectorate by French commissioner Isidore Chess√©. Tahitoe was deposed by his subjects for requesting the protectorate and his daughter and successor Queen Tehauroa unsuccessfully attempted to enlist the protection of the British to preserve the independence of Raiatea in accordance with the Convention of 1847. On 16 March 1888, the French annexed Raiatea and Tahaa after formal negotiation between Great Britain and France abrogated the 1847 Convention. The last independent monarch of Raiatea-Tahaa, King Tamatoa VI was originally from the royal family of Huahine. On 25 September 1887, five chiefs of Raiatea petitioned Papeete to send a French resident administrator. Teraupo'o refused to comply with the order of King Tamatoa VI to surrender to the French, and he built up a resistance force in 1887. Two French warships and government schooner was landed in Raiatea to override the ruling of the native courts to the advantage of a few European residents disgruntled with the recent economic depression of the copra and cotton trade. This action resulted in greater resentment within the rank of the anti-French faction of the population. LMS missionary William Edward Richards wrote that Tamatoa \\"abdicated rather than become the tool of the native French party\\" and \\"One or two villages [were] shelled and a great many native houses burnt down\\" by the French...and this made the Raiateans still more ‚Äòresolute‚Äô not to ‚Äòyield quietly‚Äô as the missionary advised\\". Tamatoa VI returned to Huahine to become a tƒÅvana (district governor) and left the government of Raiatea without a king. War of resistance Indigenous officers holding the independent flag of Raiatea at Avera, Richards wrote in 1888 that \\"the whole of the Raiatean Government (save one governor Teraupoo) were enrolled as Frenchmen and nearly the whole of the people banded together as one man to resist them.\\" Teraupo'o led the native resistance against the French in the place of Tamatoa VI. He installed a resistance government under Tuarii (a younger daughter of Tahitoe) as queen at Avera. The French established themselves at the former capital of Uturoa and appointed a r√©sident, Marie Maximilien Gustave Alby, and had the support of Tahaa chief Tavana who became known as the viceroy of Raiatea-Tahaa. A prolonged war prevented the French from entering the rural areas of Raiatea as the native resorted to guerilla warfare.; ; The conflict leading to the annexation of the Leeward Islands became known as the Leewards War, the Raiatean rebellion or the Teraupo‚Äôo War. Bearing his rifle, the \\"'oporo 'ute'ute\\" or \\"red pepper\\", Teraupo'o was able to muster a force of 800 men or nearly one third of the population of the island although Newbury noted that \\"hardly more than 359 Ra'iateans [were] under arms\\". The followers of the rebel chief were referred to as the Teraupiste. Teraupo'o's brother Hupe served as his g√©n√©ralissime or general-in-chief. The courageous chiefess Mai of Tevaitoa and her husband Moti Roi and the chief Faterehau of Opoa and his wife, a half-white woman, named Taupe allied themselves with the Teraupiste. Foreign residents were also attracted to his cause. Jose Jordan, son of American settler and blacksmith Joseph Jordan, was a partisan of Teraupo'o, and was exiled for his involvement. The German G. Neuffer became an adopted son of Teraupo'o and supplied him with arms and funds. From the few surviving letters of Teraupo'o, he was known to have been resolute in the belief that Great Britain would intervene on the behalf of their cause and rescue the natives from the French. The Raiateans unsuccessfully appealed to Robert Teesdale Simons, the British Consul in Tahiti, for assistance and offered their country to the \\"Great White Queen\\". In 1895, Queen Tuarii traveled to the British protectorate Rarontonga to seek help from the British Resident Frederick Moss who refused to meet with her. Attempts were made to mediate the conflict by Consul Simons and Tati Salmon, an Anglo-Tahitian businessman of royal descent. The French Protestant missionary Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Vernier, former chaplain of Tahiti's Queen P≈çmare IV, also unsuccessfully attempted to sway the natives. Teraupo'o also controlled the Raiatean pastors. French Protestant missionary Pastor Gaston Brunel, who took charge of the Protestant schools on the island in 1894 and was largely sympathetic to the natives, visited the camp of the resistance leader often and gain valuable insight into the rebellion. French artist Paul Gauguin, who witnessed the final phase of the rebellion, noted that diplomacy failed to persuade the natives of Raiatea to surrender. Gauguin also witnessed the 1896 expedition to Raiatea. Teraupo'o with his family, The French appointed Governor Gustave Gallet to suppress the entrenched rebellion. Gallet had previous experience with suppressing the 1878 Kanak rebellion in New Caledonia. In 1896, two French warships, the Duguay Trouin and L'Aube arrived from New Caledonia with two hundred French soldiers to quell the native resistance. The invasion force was further reinforced with a company of Tahitian volunteers. On 27 December 1896, Governor Gallet attempted to parley with the rebels to avoid bloodshed. He set an ultimatum for the rebels to surrender by 1 January 1897. The rebel government at Avera under Queen Tuarii and 1700 rebels reluctantly surrendered. Teraupo'o and the rebels of Tahaa and the district of Tevaitoa refused the call, prompting the French to land and engage the remaining armed natives. The French routed the underequipped and disorganized native forces and many fled into the mountains to escape capture. The armed native resistance ended with the capture of Teraupo'o. He and his wife and daughter fled into the mountains of Vaiaau. They evaded the French expeditionary force by hiding in the cave in the Faneuhi mountain (located at ) and rolling a boulder in front of the entrance during the day. The hiding place was discovered on the night of 15 February and 16 February 1897 when light from a fire within the cave gave the location away. On orders to capture him alive, Teraupo'o was led out of the cave by gunpoint while his family remained defiant. French historian Bruno Saura credited the discovery to \\"two Polynesians in the service of the French\\" while American historian Edward Dodd credited to an \\"astute French lieutenant\\". The casualties of the six-week campaign were nearly fifty deaths mainly on the side of the Raiateans. Exile and death The pa or the military camp of Teraupo'o, 1897 After the capture of Teraupo'o, the Chamber of Deputies in Paris proclaimed \\"the victorious end of the last military campaign in our islands\\". The Chamber ratified annexation on 19 November 1897. The captured resistance leaders were deported to Noum√©a, New Caledonia and their followers were deported to the Ua Huka in the Marquesas Islands while others were conscripted as forced laborers to improve the roads of Raiatea. Teraupo'o, his wife and his brother Hupe were exiled in New Caledonia until 1905. Teraupo'o was allowed to return to Raiatea in 1905 and lived out the rest of his life as a \\"silent, unreconstructed recluse\\". He died at Vaiaau on 23 December 1918, at the height of the Spanish flu epidemic. His grave is currently located at Pamatai point (located at ) under a road. The next indigenous leader to advocate French resistance and Tahitian separatism was Pouvanaa a Oopa in 1958.

His work includes installations, sculptures, and video art. He is known as the \\"enfant terrible\\" of Spanish Contemporary Art. His first works dealt with personal identity, violence and the limits of pain; his later works are of a more critical, political and social nature. Azcona's works have been exhibited at the Venetian Arsenal, the Contemporary Art Center in M√°laga, the Bogot√° Museum of Modern Art, the Houston Art League, the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art in New York and the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes in Madrid. His work has also been exhibited at the Asian Art Biennale in Dhaka and Taipei, the Lyon Biennale, the Miami International Performance Festival and the Bangladesh Live Art Biennale. The Bogot√° Museum of Contemporary Art dedicated a retrospective exhibition to him in 2014. Early life Abel Azcona was born on 1 April, 1988, as the result of an unwanted pregnancy, in the Montesa Clinic in Madrid, an institution that was run by a religious community. It was geared towards people at risk of social exclusion and homelessness. His father's identity is unknown, and his mother, a drug user and prostitute called Victoria Luj√°n Guti√©rrez, abandoned him at the clinic a few days after his birth. The nuns gave the newborn baby to a man who knew his mother and who insisted he was the father, even though he met her when she was already pregnant and was her partner only sporadically. Azcona was then raised in the city of Pamplona with this man, who continuously went in and out of prison, and his family, which was unstructured and linked to drug trafficking and delinquency. The first four years of Azcona's life were characterised by mistreatment, abuse and abandonment, caused by different members within his family environment, and the fact he passed through various residences, which caused several concerns about custody from public institutions of social protection. Due to this precarious situation, his birth was not registered until the age of four, in 1992, when Social Welfare intervened. A young catholic woman from Navarre was introduced to a newborn Azcona when she met the man who brought newborn Azcona from the Montesa clinic in Madrid to Pamplona in prison, where she volunteered; he still falsely presented himself as Azcona's biological father. She coordinated a catholic group in the Saint Vincent of Pa√∫l parish and was a volunteer with Caritas Internationalis. This meeting in the penitentiary center led to the baptism of Azcona when he was uncommonly old, in a parish located in front of the prison, requested by the woman, who became his godmother. She was the eldest daughter of a conservative Navarrese family (with three daughters); the family started taking Azcona in when he was four years old ‚Äì typically over short periods of time and weekends ‚Äì after the man came out of prison and they realised how poor Azcona's situation was. They informally cared for him until the age of six, when they requested to foster him on a more permanent basis. When he was six, the situation with the man's family got worse and custody was withdrawn. An adoption request began to be processed, and he was officially adopted by the eldest daughter at the age of seven. The family also intervened to allow him to be accepted into the catholic schools the daughters had attended. However, he had problems adapting to the family and to the school, which manifested in instances of theft and violence at the school until he was expelled at the age of thirteen. Name Throughout his life, Abel Azcona has been officially known by various names: Abel Luj√°n Guti√©rrez, Abel David Lebrijo Gonz√°lez, Abel David Azcona Marcos, David Azcona Marcos, and Abel David Azcona Ema. Azcona's biological mother chose the name Abel and, when registering him at the Montesa Clinic as her own, he was first named Abel Luj√°n Guti√©rrez, using both her surnames. The child was not registered in the Civil Registry until he was four years of age and, as he had been abandoned by his mother, her partner took care of the child and registered him as Abel David Lebrijo Gonz√°lez, using his surnames; these are the first surnames that appear legally. From then on, in different records and documents, such as at school, the second surname is shown as Raposo, that of the man's new partner. At the age of seven he was adopted and became known as Abel David Azcona Ema, taking on the surnames of his adoptive mother. The adoptive family refused to use tha name Abel, since it implied a connection to the biological mother, so they called him David. At fifteen years of age, Azcona was adopted by the husband of his adoptive mother, becoming Abel David Marcos Azcona (taking his surname); after a family process to invert the surnames was approved, 'Azcona' returned as the first surname, and he legally became Abel David Azcona Marcos. At the age of twenty he decided to remove the name David, as he no longer had a relationship with his adoptive family, and started using Abel again, as a tribute to his biological mother and as a response to the restrictions he felt with the other name.  Early works  Azcona's first performances were created in the streets of Pamplona in 2005 when he was a student in the Pamplona School of Art. They all had a critical spirit and were an objective of denunciation. During these early years, Azcona turned his traumatic experiences into artistic works. In 2011 and 2012 his artworks started gaining greater relevance, but in 2012 he was admitted to two psychiatric clinics, one in Barcelona and the other in Pamplona, where he stayed for some time as he had deep mental issues and had made a serious suicide attempt. When he came out of the centres, he made a performance demonstration, totally naked and sitting on a chair, to interrupt traffic on one of the main streets of Pamplona. Since this, he has carried out some works in the streets periodically, all of them with the same critical spirit and intent to denounce, with themes such as abandonment, violence, identity and sexuality. He has been detained on various occasions for these. Azcona's adoption was characterised by complicated situations and a lack of attachment to the family, until he abandoned it definitively when he was eighteen. He then returned to Madrid, living in poverty on the streets for almost two years. During this time he occasionally committed crime and practised prostitution, but also carried out artistic works in the streets of Madrid.  Artistic works  = Empathy and Prostitution = Empathy and Prostitution is a conceptual and performative work of critical and biographical content. It was created and first performed in the Santa Fe Gallery, Bogot√°, in February 2013. The work had a second performance at the Factor√≠a de Arte y Desarrollo, an artistic space in Madrid, in November 2013, and there was a third performance at the Houston International Performance Biennial, in February 2014. Azcona was inspired by his biological mother, a prostitute, and sought to empathise with her and with the moment of his own conception. Azcona offered himself naked to the galleries' visitors on a bed with white sheets, so that they could exchange intimacy or have sexual relations with him. Photographs, drawings and documentation of the work were part of the Art Is Hope charity exhibitions in Paris and Pride in New York. The depictions of the performance piece have been exhibited in museums such as the Palais de Tokyo and the Perrotin Gallery, and also displayed at the Piasa auction house in Paris. The New York exhibition and auction at Paddle8 promoted sexual diversity and featured artists such as Haring, Bourgeois, Goldin, Mapplethorpe, Warhol, and Azcona himself. In 2017 there were also exhibitions in museums such as the Tulla Center in the Albanian capital Tirana. The Juan Gallery in Madrid, which specializes in performance art, included this work in a retrospective exhibition, The Extinction of Desire, which focused on works with sexual themes. = Someone Else = Someone Else is a conceptual and performative work of critical and biographical content. Following on with the same concepts as Empathy and Prostitution, the inaugural 2014 Queer New York Arts Festival was opened with a work by Azcona entitled Someone Else. In this, physical or even sexual contact with the artist was required to enter the venue of the event, which was held at Grace Exhibition Space and the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art in New York City. This work was chosen by critic Hrag Vartanian as one of the top ten of the year in New York City. = The War = The War is a conceptual and performative work of critical and biographical content. In 2016, Azcona activated his last sex-themed piece in this series, La Guerra (The War), which premiered at the Intramurs Festival in Valencia, Spain, which was again inspired by prostitution, criticism and sexuality. On this occasion, Azcona offered his naked body, anesthetized by the use of narcotics, so that the visitors could use it freely. = The Streets = The Streets (La Calle; \\"the sexual exchange\\") is a conceptual and performative work of critical and biographical content. At the end of 2014 and the early part of 2015, Azcona performed the work as a process where he prostitutes himself on the streets. In it, he explored a change towards becoming the figure of his mother, taking hormones and engaging in prostitution. It began in the Santa Fe neighborhood of Bogot√°, with the process continuing in the cities of Madrid and Mexico City. The performance emerged, as with the rest of his sex-themed works, as an exercise in empathy with his own biological mother. It was also a social critique, where the artist explored the limits of his body by repeating patterns of sexual abuse, things which occurred in his own childhood and in the life of his mother. = The Shame = Developed along the West Bank Wall in 2018, in The Shame Azcona installed original fragments of the Berlin Wall along the Israeli wall in the West Bank, which forms part of the barrier built throughout Israel to separate the Palestinian lands. Azcona made a metaphorical critique by merging both walls in the work. The actual installation, as if it were a piece of land art, currently remains along the wall, and has been exhibited in different countries through photographic and video art. The work has been criticized and denounced by Israel. Azcona during The Death of Artist at C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid = The Death of The Artist = The Death of the Artist was both a continuation of his earlier works and closure of the series, being performed in 2018 in the lobby of the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes in Madrid. His previous works had caused Azcona to receive threats, as well as be the subject of persecution and acts of violence. Azcona formally invited by letter the organisations, groups, and entities that had threatened his life to the installation, where a loaded gun was offered and Azcona stood exposed on a raised platform. In addition, the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes presented a complete reading of a manifesto titled The artist's presumption as a radical and disobedient subject, both in life and in death. = Amen or The Pederasty = Although named Amen by Azcona himself, the work is more commonly known as The Pederasty (‚ÄúLa pederastia‚Äù in Spanish). Over a period of several months in 2015, Azcona attended Eucharists in churches and parishes that were linked to his own childhood. Azcona kept the consecrated hosts given to the attendees of the communion from the churches, gathering 242 hosts; this was the number of cases of pederasty reported in the north of Spain during the previous decade. With the hosts, he made a work in which the word Pederastia (Pederasty in English) could be read. The work was first exhibited in Madrid in the summer of 2015. At the end of 2015, a section of the work was selected to be part of a retrospective exhibition of Azcona's works inside the city of Pamplona's Monument to the Fallen of the Spanish Civil War. The work was located on the altar of the old monument, which was formerly the cathedral of Pamplona; at the time of the show, it had already been desacralized. The day after the inauguration of the exhibition, multiple demonstrations and demands for its closure occurred. On multiple occasions, the Catholic Church called the work a great offense to Christian belief. Azcona documented all the situations of confrontation and included them in other exhibitions of the work. He also endured more than five years of judicial proceedings for various complaints about the work at different courts and judicial entities. The work has been exhibited in museums in Berga, Mallorca, Murcia, Madrid and Lleida. The latest exhibition in Lleida was presented in Tatxo Benet's collection, which included works by Azcona, Ai Weiwei, Francisco de Goya, Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. Spain Asks for Forgiveness by Azcona in La Habana = Spain Asks for Forgiveness = Spain Asks for Forgiveness is a conceptual and performative work of critical and anti-colonial content by artist Abel Azcona. Created and started in Bogot√° in November 2018 through a conference and a live performance by Azcona at the museum of contemporary art of Bogot√°. In November 2018, through a conference and live performance by artist Abel Azcona in the Bogot√° Contemporary Art Museum the work Spain Asks for Forgiveness (Espa√±a os Pide Perd√≥n in Spanish) began, a piece of critical and anticolonialist content. In the first action Azcona read a text of ninety two hours for more than four hours. In the reading the cite Spain Asks for Forgiveness was repeated continuously. Two months later, azcona was invited to present his work in Mexico City in the Mexico City Museum, where he installed a sailcloth with the same sentence on it. Just a few days later the president of Mexico Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador during a press conference demanded publicly an apology from Spain. Since then until mid 2020, the work has been shown in diverse ways and has achieved to become a collective movement. In May 2020 the Bogot√° Contemporary Art Museum painted its facade with the installation's motto Espa√±a os pide perd√≥n for two months in the centre of the city of Bogot√°. Other cities such as La Habana, Cuba; Lima, Per√∫; Caracas, Venezuela; Ciudad de Panam√°, Panam√°; Tegucigalpa, Honduras or Quito, Ecuador have been protagonists of the piece through paintings, sailcloths, posters or demonstrationa and collective acts continuing the work as a collective protest. = The Shadow = The Shadow is a conceptual work consisting of performance art, an installation, and photography, as a denunciation of dozens of child abuse cases. In the piece Azcona denounces child abuse by presenting the survivors as the protagonists. In the work, Azcona presented more than two hundred actual cases of pedophilia in museums and galleries in various cities in Spain. At each show, Azcona gave a live performance, from a wooden swing, of the experiences of the survivors. = Eating a Koran = Eating a Koran was first presented in October 2012 in the exhibition space of the College of Performing Arts of the University of the Arts in Berlin. Azcona began a series of works of a performative nature, which each criticise religious entities. In the works, Azcona used representative icons of various religions, such as the Koran, the Bible, the Torah and other objects of a sacred character. In the most controversial of them, Azcona performed for nine hours ingesting the pages of a copy of the Koran. This work provoked the most repercussions of any of the series, and the artist was threatened for the piece. The work was performed again in the Krudtt√∏nden, Copenhagen. From there, Azcona founded an art collection together with other artists such as Lars Vilks and Bj√∏rn N√∏rgaard, who had been persecuted and threatened for their creations. With the collective of himself, Vilks, N√∏rgaard, the writer Salman Rushdie and the cartoonist Charb (who was killed in the Charlie Hebdo shooting), Azcona carried out performances and conferences about freedom of speech in the Krudtt√∏nden between 2013 and 2015. In 2015 the Krudtt√∏nden building was attacked by terrorists during one of the conferences. Subsequently, the work Eating a Koran was bought by a Danish collector and donated to the Krudtt√∏nden for the permanent exhibition. Azcona's Los Padres, Madrid Azcona's Los Padres, Madrid = The Fathers = The Fathers was first performed in 2016 in Madrid with the final performance, also in Madrid, in 2017; it was in an exhibition format. The piece included dozens of female former prostitutes who gave a physical description of their last client. On the other side of a long table, composite artists listened to them and drew images of the clients. The performance generated dozens of portraits which, at the closing of the work in 2017, were exhibited with the premise that any of them could be Azcona's father. The biographical work creates a critical discourse with prostitution and its inheritance, and in the case of Azcona himself, of an unknown father, having been conceived during an act of prostitution. = Political Disorder = For Political Disorder, Azcona joined many different institutions and political parties. The work was made up of dozens of original documents of affiliation to dozens of political parties in Spain, membership cards or documentation of fees and payments. The piece, in which Azcona joins all the Spanish political parties, is a critique of the system that prioritizes economic interest over true ideology. Azcona joined Falange Espa√±ola, Vox, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and the Popular Party. He also became a member of entities with a political connotation such as the extreme right-wing organization Hazte O√≠r, the Francisco Franco National Foundation, the Spanish nazi organization Hogar Social and the \\"Christian Lawyers\\". The multi-year project concluded at the Andr√©s-Missirlian Space Museum in Romainm√¥tier, Switzerland in 2017. In this exhibition, Azcona included the expulsion letters of each of the political parties and organizations. = Buried = Buried was created in 2015 through a public and participatory performance, or happening, on the esplanade of the Monument to the Fallen in Pamplona. Azcona invited dozens of relatives of Republicans who were shot, persecuted or disappeared during the Spanish Civil War. Descendants of victims make up the installation in a row in front of the monument, all symbolically buried with soil from the garden of one of the participants, where his relatives had been shot. In 2016, the city of Pamplona invited Azcona to show his work inside the Monument and the project was recreated there, after it had been converted into an exhibition hall, under the title Unearthed: A retrospective view on the political and subversive work of the artist Abel Azcona. The exhibition brought together the Buried project and fragments of all of Azcona's works. = Desafectos = In 2016, Azcona coordinated a new performative action, or happening, with relatives of those who were shot in the Pozos de Caud√©. Under the name of Desafectos, Azcona formed a wall with the relatives as a complaint, next to the wells outside the city of Teruel, where more than a thousand people had been shot and thrown into the wells over the course of three days during the Civil War. = The Nine Confinements or The Deprivation of Liberty = The Nine Confinements, also known as The Deprivation of Liberty, was a sequence of performances carried out between 2013 and 2016. All of the series had a theme of deprivation of liberty. The first in the series was performed by Azcona in 2013 and named Confinement in Search of Identity. The artist was to remain for 60 days in a space built inside an art gallery of Madrid, with scarce food resources and in total darkness. The performance was stopped after 42 days for health reasons, with Azcona being subsequently hospitalised. Azcona created these works as a reflection and also a discursive interruption of his own mental illness; themes of mental illness are often present in Azcona's work. Another of the confinements lasted nine days in the Lyon Biennale. Azcona remained inside a garbage container strategically located in the center of the Biennale as a criticism of the artist's own gestation and the market of contemporary art itself. One of the last projects of the series was Black Hole. Performed in 2015, Azcona again remained locked in a small space without light and with poor food in the same art gallery in Madrid. On this occasion, different unknown guests shared the confinement with the artist. Azcona was unaware of the guests' origins and could not see them. Visitors of the art gallery were told of the experience by those entering and leaving the confinement with the artist. All projects were curated and documented from the point of view of the deprivation of liberty including deprivation of food, water, electricity, and contact with the outside.  Style  Azcona's works push his body to the limit and are usually related to social issues. Azcona states that within his works he pursues an end beyond the purely aesthetic. His intent with his works is to question the viewer and force them to react, making his own body the representation of critical and political subjects. The themes of most of his performances are autobiographical and focused on issues such as abandonment, violence, abuse, child abuse, mental illness, deprivation of liberty, prostitution, and life and death. A characteristic of Azcona's work is that he conceives his pieces as process art, which implies that they are of a long duration. Many of his works are created starting with what he calls \\"a detoner\\" and, from that first performance, new movements and protests arise, which make the piece discursive.  Controversies  Azcona has been involved in several controversies and legal proceedings. In his first actions in the streets of Pamplona in 2005, Azcona was arrested several times. Later, during his self-confinement in the work Dark Room, public opinion was against the harshness of his self-imposed deprivation of liberty and food, generating controversy. The work was stopped after 42 days and the artist admitted to a psychiatric clinic. Similarly, people spoke in favour of ending the work where Azcona stayed continually in a garbage container during the Lyon Biennale. The works of Azcona with explicit sexuality, such as Empathy and Prostitution and Las Horas, were criticized when shown in cities such as Houston and Mexico City, cities where, at the time of the exposition, anti-sodomy or sexual diversity laws existed. In 2012, he was threatened and persecuted for his work Eating a Koran, in which he ingested a copy of the Koran at University of the Arts in Berlin. During the years 2014 and 2015 he was arrested and his exhibitions in the United States were canceled. In 2014, the first Utero performance in Houston was criticized in the media for \\"exceeding the limits of integrity and endangering his own life\\". During a Miami exhibition in 2015, twelve children walked into a performance inside the art gallery with guns in their hands, with was a critique of the laws and the permissibility of weapons in the United States. The exhibition was canceled and Azcona had to return to Europe. A few months later he performed a new work in Chicago, where he denounced the political and ideological nature of Donald Trump. The artistic action was described as \\"heroic\\" by the American newspaper Huffington Post. In 2015, he was denounced by the Carlist Traditionalist Union for performing the work Buried inside the Monument to the Fallen of Pamplona. The work demanded memory and reparation for the victims of the Republican side. Its exhibition inside the Monument, built in order to exalt Franco, Mola and Sanjurjo, was considered offensive by the far-right conservatives. Azcona's work denounces child abuse, and has been persecuted and criticised for being critical of the Church in works such as The Shadow and Amen or The Pederasty. Amen was sued three times before the Superior Court of Justice of Navarre for three crimes and alleged desecration and blasphemy. The first lawsuit was brought by the Archbishopric of Pamplona and Tudela, who are representatives of the Catholic Church in the north of Spain; the second lawsuit was brought by the Delegation of the Government in Navarre, controlled by the Popular Party at the time; and the third was by the Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Abogados Cristianos (Spanish Association of Christian Lawyers), who also made criminal complaints against Azcona. The lawsuits were all won by Azcona, but the group took the complaint to the Supreme Court. Whilst awaiting the case being heard by the Supreme Court, the Association of Christian Lawyers (acting alone) started a protest against Spain in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for not condemning Azcona, and, according to them, for protecting him. Each time the work was shown, the complaint was re-formulated, so Azcona was cited in the Court of Justice of Palma de Mallorca and in the High Court of Justice of Catalonia in Barcelona. After five years of judicial proceedings for works critical of the Catholic Church and, more specifically, criticism relating to pedophilia, Azcona announced his intent to be \\"disobedient\\" in relation to the charges, and the complainants added obstruction of justice to their complaints. When the High Court of Justice of Catalonia issued a judicial arrest warrant in 2019 after Azcona failed to appear before the court for the third time, Azcona went into exile and settled in Lisbon, Portugal. This has not prevented him from opening new exhibitions in the Spain and publishing critical works. He defends his artistic ideology and his political ideas, which are supported by certain sectors of the Spanish left-wing. Conversely, his works are seen as desecration and sacrilege by the most conservative sector of Spanish and Latin American society. In 2016, Azcona was denounced for exalting terrorism. In his exhibition Still Life, Azcona recreated, in the form of sculptures, performance and hyper-realistic installations, current and historical situations of violence in diverse themes such as historical memory, terrorism and conflict. Two years later, in 2018, he was denounced by the Francisco Franco National Foundation for exposing a signed detonation report for the Monument of the Valley of the Fallen. He was also criticized by Israel for the piece The Shame, where the artist installed fragments of the Berlin Wall along the West Bank Wall. The same year he represented Spain at the Asia Art Biennale in Dhaka: his installation featured wooden chairs with distressed children from the streets of Dhaka, and the performance was interrupted by protests from the organisation and its attendees.

Early life Valgrisi was born in Charly near Lyon circa 1490. Career During his career, he published approximately 200 works. Most of his work was published in Venice, with a brief period being published in Rome from 1549 to 1551. Valgrisi was in Venice well before 1532.

Production =Background= In Lucha libre, the Mexican version of professional wrestling the Ruleta de la Muerte (\\"Roulette of Death\\") is a type of Professional wrestling tournament where the loser or losers of a match would advance in the tournament instead of the winners. The finals of a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament featured the losing team wrestle each other under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" rules, where the loser would be forced to either unmask or have all their hair shaved off as a result. Various Mexican promotions have held Ruleta de la Muerte tournaments, some like International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) has held these tournaments on a regular basis. The earliest such tournament was in 1998 part of the Arena Naucalpan 21st Anniversary Show and saw Mega defeat Judo Suwa, forcing the Japanese wrestler to have his hair shaved off. Most of the Ruleta de la Muerte tournaments have followed the traditional lucha libre format, except for the April 2015 Ruleta de la Muerte show, where it instead was a four-man steel cage match instead. 2015 saw a second Ruleta de la Muerte tournament, where Diva Salvaje and Toscano defeated Danny Casas and X-Fly, after which Danny Casas pinned X-Fly to force X-Fly to be shaved bald as a result.

Composed between 1921 and 1922, it was first performed in 1923 and published in 1925. Description Thomas Hardy in 1923, the year By Footpath and Stile premiered By Footpath and Stile consists of six settings of poems written by Thomas Hardy during and shortly after World War I. Its title is adapted from \\"I went by footpath and by stile\\", the opening line of the first of song in the cycle. The ordering of the poems in the song cycle, all of which deal with death, loss, separation, and the passing of time, is not chronological, but Finzi's own. The final poem, \\"Exeunt Omnes\\", recapitulates the themes in three of the previous poems in the cycle. Sequence of the poems in the cycle and their publication dates: 1\\\\. \\"Paying Calls\\" (1917) 2\\\\. \\"Where the Picnic Was\\" (1914) 3\\\\. \\"The Oxen\\" (1919) 4\\\\. \\"The Master and the Leaves\\" (1919) 5\\\\. \\"Voices from Things Growing in a Churchyard\\" (1921, revised 1922) 6\\\\. \\"Exeunt Omnes\\" (1914) A performance of the complete cycle, which is scored for solo baritone and string quartet, takes approximately 22 minutes. History 6 Queen Square, London where By Footpath and Stile premiered on 24 October 1923 By Footpath and Stile is the earliest of the six song cycles by Finzi set to poems by Thomas Hardy, who was Finzi's favourite poet. During the course of his career he set over fifty of Hardy's poems. Composed in 1921-1922, it was premiered on 24 October 1923 by the baritone Sumner Austin and the Charles Woodhouse String Quartet in a British Music Society concert at 6 Queen Square, London. The work received a repeat performance on 18 February 1927 in Liverpool, again in a British Music Society concert. The score was published as his Opus 2 in 1925 by Curwen & Sons at Finzi's own expense. The reviews of the cycle's premiere were \\"all favourable and encouraging\\", according to Finzi's biographer, Diana McVeagh. A critic in The Musical Times reviewed the published score in 1926 and described it as \\"a highly interesting work\\" and went on to write: \\"It is true that the music is vitally influenced by Vaughan Williams, but the composer uses the idiom with imagination and sensitiveness.\\" However, Finzi remained dissatisfied with the work. In 1934, he withdrew it from publication and had Curwen's plates and remaining stock destroyed. He also asked Curwen to withdraw three of his earlier songs which included \\"The Cupboard\\", a setting of a Robert Graves poem. In April 1934 Finzi wrote about the withdrawal in a letter to his friend Howard Ferguson: \\"They are all really bad works, though I may one day revise Footpath and Stile.\\" In 1941, Finzi revised two of the songs from the cycle, \\"Paying Calls\\" and \\"The Oxen\\". That year he wrote in his personal catalogue of works that apart from those revised songs, \\"the original withdrawn edition should be utterly forgotten\\" and labelled it as a \\"premature publication\\". In 1981, 25 years after Finzi's death, Boosey & Hawkes re-issued the full score of By Footpath and Stile with his 1941 revisions and edited by Howard Ferguson. The cycle did not receive its first commercial recording until 2006 when Roderick Williams and the Sacconi Quartet recorded it on the Naxos label. It was recorded again in 2012 by Marcus Farnsworth and the Finzi Quartet on the Resonus label. Resonus re-issued the recording in 2019. 21st-century critical reception Critical reaction, based on the only two recordings (of 2006 and 2012), has been largely positive, while noting the composer's relative immaturity. Andrew Clements called the quartet writing \\"rather stodgy\\" and said that the vocal lines \\"only intermittently seem personal\\", but also said that the subject matter (death and transience) is totally characteristic of Finzi's later work. According to an anonymous writer for Boosey & Hawkes, \\"The music reflects a youthful composer‚Äôs intuitive response to poems which were themselves newly published but Finzi‚Äôs musical hallmarks are already evident, even if they are not as sophisticated in their presentation as in the songs which were to follow. The collection forms an important first milestone\\". Greg Keane called the cycle \\"precocious\\", and the musical idiom \\"an acquired taste\\", but said that the work stopped short of being \\"impossibly arty\\". Jeremy Dibble found the cycle more modal than many of Finzi's later works, and noted a debt to Vaughan Williams's 1909 cycle On Wenlock Edge (for tenor, piano and string quartet). Colin Anderson wrote, \\"By Footpath and Stile is word-setting and Nature-painting at its most-haunting; music of atmosphere and rapture\\". An anonymous critic in BBC Music Magazine called the cycle \\"striking\\", \\"impressive in Finzi's equable way\\", and \\"responding memorably to the cool-climate vividness of the poems\\".

The author of the book is unknown and modern scholars have established that the final stage of the Hebrew text would have been formed by the second century BCE. Chapters 1 and 2 form the exposition of the book. This chapter introduces Mordecai and his adoptive daughter, Esther, whose beauty won the approval of the king Ahasuerus, and she was crowned the queen of Persia (). Given information from Mordecai, Esther warned the king of an assassination plan (verses 21‚Äì), so that the would-be assassins were executed on the gallows, and the king owed Mordecai his life. Text This chapter was originally written in the Hebrew language and since the 16th century, is divided into 23 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). The Greek text of Esther 2:3‚Äì8 in the Codex Sinaiticus. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). The king's decision to seek a new queen (2:1‚Äì4) To find a replacement for a Persian queen after the deposal of Vashti, the king decided to hold a nationwide contest following the advice of his counselors. =Verse 3= :And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: KJV *\\"Shushan\\": or \\"Susa\\".Note [a] on Esther 2:3 in NKJV *\\"The palace\\" (KJV): from Hebrew word ◊ë÷¥÷º◊ô◊®÷∏◊î (birah); NKJV: \\"citadel\\".Note [b] on Esther 2:3 in NKJV *\\"Hege\\" (Hebrew: , 'Hebrew Text Analysis: Esther 2:3.

NIV, CEV, NLT: \\"beauty treatments.\\"Note [b] on Esther 2:3 in NET Esther's admission to the court (2:5‚Äì11) As the requirement to enter the contest is simply her beauty (verse 3), Esther‚Äôs status of being Jewish, a descendant of captives (verse 6), without father and mother, did not hinder her entrance to the court. Once she was in the harem, she obtained 'a favored position in eyes of the harem- master'. =Verse 5= :Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; KJV *\\"Mordecai\\": a name that reflects the name of the Babylonian deity Marduk; a possible common custom of many Jews at that time to have 'two names: one for secular use and the other for use especially within the Jewish community', but there is no record of Mordecai's Jewish name in the biblical text.Note [a] on Esther 2:5 in NET. =Verse 6= :Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.'

This part contains the description of the twelve-month course of beautifying treatments for the candidates of the Persian queen. It also gives a hint of Esther's character: she might possess 'innate cunning' to distinguish herself from her competitors and at the end was chosen to be the queen. =Verse 12= :Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) KJV *\\"According to the manner of the women\\": from Hebrew \\"to be to her according to the law of the women\\"; NASB \\"under the regulations for the women.\\"Note [a] on Esther 2:12 in NET. =Verse 16= :So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. KJV The time referred to in the verse falls in the January or February of 478 BC which would have been very shortly after Xerxes' return to Susa from the war with the Greeks, thus the long delay in replacing Vashti can be explained by the long absence of Xerxes in Greece.Ellicott, C.

It is south of Rogers Pass, northeast of Revelstoke, and west of Golden. The mountain was first climbed in 1898 by Charles Ernest Fay and Redt F. Curtis. The mountain's name was officially adopted February 8, 1977, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. It is named for Mrs. Julia M. Young (1853-1925), the Glacier House manager from 1899 through 1920. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Youngs Peak is in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports the Asulkan Glacier on the northwest slope, and the Geikie Glacier on the east slope. Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from its glaciers drains north into a tributary of the Illecillewaet River, and south into headwaters of the Incomappleux River. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing Youngs Peak.

He performed in the 1953 film Dark Venture, alongside Calvert. Jimmy was also featured in Calvert's magic shows in the United States, and on-board his luxury yacht throughout Asia and Australia. He died of a heart attack at the age of 16 at the Perth Zoo. Career Jimmy was born in Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique) around 1952. He was recruited from the wild by John Calvert to appear in the \\"white hunter\\" film Dark Venture (1956). Calvert was a travelling magician, film actor, and director. He received fame for playing the debonair detective Michael Waring (aka 'The Falcon'). He was also a notorious self-promoter and claimed that Jimmy was the same chimp who played Cheeta in Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies. However, this was a fabrication, as the last of these Tarzan films was released in 1948, several years before Jimmy was born. Calvert shot Dark Venture on location in East Africa in 1953, but the film was not released until 1956. After filming, Calvert brought Jimmy back to California to live and work with him. In 1957, Calvert and Jimmy set sail on a tour of the Pacific, onboard the luxury yacht Sea Fox. They performed magic shows in Honolulu, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, before finally arriving in Darwin in June 1959. Jimmy was almost fully grown by they time the yacht arrived in Australia. He purportedly became very difficult to manage at sea, often attacking Calvert and members of the crew. Jimmy was denied entry by Darwin quarantine officers, who warned Calvert that the animal would be put down if brought ashore. Instead Calvert kept him onboard the yacht, and arranged with the Taronga Park Zoo to take Jimmy when they arrived in Sydney. The zoo was reportedly \\"delighted\\" by the prospect of receiving a young male chimpanzee. However, trouble struck in July 1959, when the Sea Fox became lost at sea on its passage from Darwin to Sydney. The yacht began taking water, its pumps failed, and it had to be rescued by HMAS Emu, which towed Calvert, Jimmy and crew to the nearby Elcho Island. The Indigenous locals of Elcho Island were astounded by Calvert's magic tricks and even more astounded by the sight of a chimpanzee, whose likeness they entered into rock art. According to researcher Brian Hubber, they referred to the Sea Fox as the \\"monkey ship\\" and \\"there was even talk of creating a 'monkey ship' corroboree.\\" The famous Indigenous Australian musician Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu was a native of Elcho Island, and according to biographer Robert Hillman, Gurrumul encountered Jimmy and even nicknamed his drummer after the animal. While Calvert flew on to Sydney to continue his tour, Jimmy was abandoned on Elcho Island, before being rescued by Sir Edward Hallstrom of the Taronga Park Zoo. Salvage expert Carl Atkinson managed to repair the Sea Fox and sail it back to Darwin, where he claimed the yacht as his own and sold it. Jimmy occupied an enclosure in the Taronga Park Zoo from 1959 to 1962. After failing to breed with female chimpanzees, he was relocated to the Perth Zoo. Jimmy was a popular attraction at both zoos, with many visitors believing the fable that he was the same animal who starred in the Tarzan films. They were also entertained by the sight of a smoking monkey. Jimmy passed away in May 1968 at the young age of 16 years. A post mortem revealed heart attack, probably caused by smoking, to be the cause of his death. His body was offered to the Western Australian Museum, where his skull and death mask are currently kept.

It was designed by William Henry Randoll Blacking and built in 1939‚Äì41, with later additions. History The stained glass of 1985, depicting John's vision of the Son of Man. St Aldhelm's was built as a result of expansion and development of Radipole, which left the parish church of St Ann unable to provide adequate accommodation. By 1937, Radipole had over 6,000 inhabitants and St Ann was only capable of accommodating 250. Fundraising for the new church began in 1936, and Mr. Alfred A. Hayward donated a plot of land on Spa Road for the church in memory of his wife in December of that year. In addition to the funds raised by Radipole's parochial church council, a ladies' working party was also formed to raise funds. A donation of ¬£200 was received from Dame Violet Wills of Devon, while grants included ¬£249 from Salisbury Diocesan funds and ¬£300 from the Dorset Church Building Committee. Once ¬£2,000 had been raised, a Diocesan interest-free loan of ¬£2,500 was obtained in 1938. Plans for the new church were drawn up by William Henry Randoll Blacking, and Ralph Fry of Kingsbury Episcopi hired as the builder. The foundation stone of the church was laid by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. Neville Lovett, on 17 October 1939. Owing to limited funds, the church was to be built in phases, with the first phase to include three bays] of the nave, the east and west aisles, and a chancel. The cost of this first phase of construction was approximately ¬£4,700. The west end of the church was built with temporary walls as two further bays were due to be added in the future. With the closure of Christ Church, Weymouth, in 1939, the Rector, Rev. E. L. Langston, gifted furniture from the church to St Aldhelm's, including the pulpit, font and pews. In 1940, Weymouth College also closed and the Rector of Radipole, Rev. W. S. Syson, accepted twelve stalls from the college chapel for installation in St Aldhelm's. A number of memorials were also received from the chapel, including oak panels commemorating boys of the college who lost their lives in World War I. They were placed in a corner of the west aisle to form a memorial chapel. St Aldhelm's was dedicated by the Bishop of Sherborne, the Right Rev. Harold Rodgers, on 15 March 1941. The Bishop performed the ceremony on behalf of the Bishop of Salisbury, who was unable to attend due to illness. With further fundraising throughout the 1950s, a church hall of Reema construction was built behind the church and dedicated in 1961. It provided a number of community uses, including as a Sunday school and also contained a badminton court. In 1969, the Bishop of Sherborne, the Right Rev. Victor Pike, dedicated a new porch, and clergy and choir vestries, which were all built at the front of the church. Owing to the growing congregation, the church's interior was altered and the seating realigned in 1979‚Äì1980. The church then underwent extension work, after Rev. Richard Luther initiated a scheme to build a new section containing a lounge, kitchen, office, toilets and creche room. The plans were drawn up by K. C. White & Partners. As part of the scheme, a baptistry was also created, the church's pews were replaced by chairs and a new heating system was installed. The extension was dedicated on 21 January 1983 by the Bishop of Sherborne, the Right Rev. John Kirkham. In 2010, planning permission was granted for the church hall to be replaced with a new facility. The ¬£1.8 million St Aldhelm's Church Centre was opened by the Bishop of Sherborne, the Right Rev. Graham Kings, in June 2012. Architecture St Aldhelm's is built of Poole bricks, with purple-grey facing Sussex bricks and dressings of Box Ground Bath stone. The piers were constructed using engineering bricks to provide additional strength. The interior is painted white and the ceiling is of five-sided barrel design, with moulded pine ribs and panels. The steps of the original chancel and sanctuary are of Purbeck stone, with artificial stone paving. The nave of the church has flooring of pine wood blocks. The church retains the memorials received from the college chapel, although the fittings received from Christ Church have since been passed on to other churches. The organ was built by Norman and Beard and rebuilt by Henry Willis & Sons. The church's communion table, font and pulpit are all modern. The church's single bell has since been removed from the bellcote for safety reasons. The chancel contains stained glass gifted to the church by an anonymous person in 1985. It was designed and made by Jon Callan of Dorchester, and depicts John's vision of the Son of Man.

After 1933 non-Nazi political activity was banned: Pietzuch became a resistance activist. Although few precise details of his activism during the early Hitler period survive, it is believed that he was at the centre of a resistance network (\\"...Widerstandorganisation Emil Pietzuch\\") in Berlin comprising at least 40 men and women. He was forced to flee the country for the last time in 1937 and ended up in the Soviet Union where he fell foul of the institutionalised paranoia that was a feature of Stalin's rule. He died in a Soviet labour camp, probably at the end of 1943. During the years of one- party dictatorship in East Germany between 1949 and 1990 Pietzuch was officially celebrated as a war hero, and it was believed by scholars that he had been parachuted back into Germany near Munich, and then captured and murdered by Nazi \\"SS\\" paramilitaries during 1944, towards the end of the war. It was only with the opening up of previously concealed government records that followed the political collapse of the East German and Soviet dictatorships in 1989/90 that Margarete Forszpaniak, a former resistance comrade, disclosed the truth about Pietzuch's death to the historian , having herself learned it two decades earlier from , the responsible East German Central Committee official. Life and activism =Provenance and early years= Emil Pietzuch was born in , near Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was known before) 1945). He grew up in conditions of some poverty and trained as a carpenter-joiner. During the final part of the First World War he was conscripted for war service. After the war ended he settled in Berlin. =International communist= In August 1922 Pietzuch joined the recently launched Communist Party. In 1924 he took over party duties as head of the \\"Zersetzungsapparat\\" (loosely, \\"degradation apparatus\\"), targeting military and police personnel in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Towards the end of 1925 he was arrested in connection with this activity. He faced trial at the Supreme Court of Justice which determined that he had been disseminating \\"anti-military propaganda among army and personnel\\" (\\"...antimilitaristische Propaganda unter der Reichswehr und der Schutzpolizei\\"), which supported a charge of \\"preparing high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). Found guilty in June 1926, he was sentenced to a thirty-month jail term. After a conditional early release in the middle part of 1927 Pitzuch made his way to Mannheim where he became a party organiser (\\"Orgleiter\\") for the Baden region. He returned to Berlin in 1928. He now worked with the Trades Union department of the Party Central Committee. Later that year he traveled to Moscow where he took part on the Sixth World Congress of the Communist International (\\"Comintern\\") and was elected to various committees and commissions. Back in Germany, in 1929 he was accepted into to the national leadership of the party's recently established Revolutionary Trades Union Opposition (\\"Revolution√§re Gewerkschafts Opposition\\"), intended as the basis for an alternative communist sponsored trades union movement. In April 1932, Pietzuch returned to Baden where he resumed his activities as party organiser (\\"Orgleiter\\"). Later that year and during much of 1933 he was back in Moscow, this time as an \\"aspirant student\\" at the secretive \\"M-School\\" ('military training establishment) surrounded by a large partially wooded area fenced about with barbed wire at Bakovka (Kuntsevo), some 20 miles to the west of central Moscow. Here he was identified by the code name \\"Artur\\". =Hitler years, resistance and exile= In January 1933, the Hitler government took power and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party state dictatorship. Sources are vague on the timelines of Pietzuch's actions over the next few years, but during or before the first part of 1934 he was back in Germany, with instructions from comrades to organise communist sabotage and terror activities. According to court documents prepared for a trial in 1940 (which would never take place because Pietzuch was by that time permanently abroad) over the next few years Pietzuch recruited a significant number of activists who were involved in courier work, passing messages and distributing political publications, or entrusted with \\"special tasks\\". In 1936, with Gestapo surveillance becoming increasingly ubiquitous, Pietzuch left Germany and, like many resistance activists at this time, headed for Prague. Here he was arrested and detained on charges of espionage offences against the Czechoslovak state. Release soon followed, however, and he made his way back to Moscow. At the beginning of 1937 Pietzuch returned to Berlin where he participated with fellow activists in the preparation of violent measures targeting the state. By 2 April 1937 he was living secretly with Karl and Eleonore Bartel in their apartment at 74 in the city centre. That morning he was at the Kitchen stove conducting experiments with explosives, with a view to the larger scale manufacture of bombs and detonators for use in sabotage actions. Unexpectedly, his experiments triggered a large explosion. The entire kitchen area was destroyed along with half of the living room. Much of the detail surrounding the event comes from the prosecution documents prepared two years later for the trial of the (by that time) widow Eleonore Bartel (and others) dated 20 October 1939: the information must be presumed to have been obtained through interrogation of members and fringe associates of the \\"Apparat Pietzuch\\". The explosion caused Pitzuch serious facial injuries. His right hand was also badly damaged. While a local policeman came in to investigate, Pietzuch was able to hide successfully. The policeman then went off to assemble some colleague for a more thorough search of the apartment: by the time they all arrived Pietzuch had left the building. The extent of Pietzuch's network of contacts now became apparent. Eleonore Bartel bandaged up his injured arm with a dish cloth and he set off in a taxi to Berlin- Sch√∂neberg where the dentistry practice Ingelath-Geerken provided a certain level of first aid and patched up his damaged face. He then visited first one and then a second Jewish physician, Dr. Zuckermann and Dr. Silberstein. For his own \\"security reasons\\", Pietzuch was unable to attend a public hospital and was therefore restricted to \\"private\\" doctors at this time of need. After his most urgent medical needs had been attended to, he moved on to Schwinem√ºndestra√üe 21 in Berlin-Wedding another district of central Berlin, where he visited another trusted associate, the electrician Herbert Nicolai. The electrician provided money and a set of false identity papers, armed with which Emil Pietzuch headed for the railway station. Still on the day of that explosion, shortly before midnight, he caught a scheduled train to Prague. As far as is known he would never see Germany again. =Final exile= Prague at this time had become a third informal capital (along with Moscow and Paris) for the exiled German Communist Party. Pietzuch remained there for nearly two years, during which time the German-speaking borderlands of Czechoslovakia (\\"Sudetenland\\") were incorporated into Nazi Germany with French and English agreement. As far as can be determined Pietzuch held no formal position within the party during this period. Party reports indicate that he was not trusted by party comrades as far back as 1936. There is reference to his having made approaches to party members without liaising with party leaders, and there was indeed mention (which at this stage came to nothing) of quietly excluding him from party membership. It was only in March 1939, with the German military taek-over of the rest of Czechoslovakia, that Pietzuch left Prague, from where he now moved back to the Soviet Union. For reasons that remain unclear the German authorities became convinced that Pietzuch had made his way from Czechoslovakia not to Russia but to England. In 1940 his name was included on the \\"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B\\" which listed British residents to be prioritized for discovery and arrest by Nazi paramilitaries following a successful German invasion of the islands. It is likely that the mistrust of comrades which had been apparent in Prague will have followed him to Moscow where he fell foul of the Stalin Purges which were intensively focused on German political exiles in Moscow in response to the sudden invasion in June 1941 of the Soviet Union by German forces in defiance of the non-aggression pact negotiated and concluded between the dictator-states two years earlier. On 22 June 1941, Emil Pietzuch was arrested by the homeland security services. He faced trial on 4 December 1943 and was sentenced to five year's loss of liberty. He did not survive his detention, and indeed probably died at the hands of the Gulag in 1943.

It sits on a cliff, located close to the modern national road from Thebes to Livadeia, and on the southern shore of the ancient Lake Copais. The tower is almost square, measuring by at its base, with a thickness of at its base. The tower is preserved at a height of . It is built of hewn stone, mostly undressed but relatively regular; only the quoins are dressed, including some ancient spolia from the nearby acropolis of ancient Haliartos. The courses of stone diminish in size with rising height. The tower had four floors. On the ground floor is a chamber some on each side, covered by a semicircular arch. The two middle floors have each eight window slits, two on each wall, while the top floor was covered by a vault reinforced by a double arch, now collapsed. There is an opening at the base, but it is of modern creation; the original gate seems to have been located well above the ground, on the second floor level, on the tower's southern face; the existence of putlog holes suggest that a wooden staircase was affixed. A number of caves exist at the edge of the cliff on which the tower sits, but it is unknown whether they are medieval, and possibly related to the tower, or of more recent date, the result of lime-burning. It is variously regarded as part of a late Byzantine defence system along the opais and the Boeotic Cephissus, but is most likely of Frankish construction.

A veteran of the American Revolution, he was most notable for his service as United States Marshal for Vermont from 1801 to 1811 and as the business manager for the educational endeavors of Emma Willard, who was his third wife. Life John Willard was born in East Guilford, Connecticut on July 23, 1759, a son of John Willard (1722-1767) and Mary (Horton) Willard (1728-1807). He was educated in East Guilford and served on a ship's crew at the start of the American Revolution. He was captured by the British, and after his release he became the quartermaster of a Connecticut regiment. After the war, Willard trained with a local physician and became a medical doctor. He then moved to Middlebury, Vermont, where he established a practice. Willard became a member of the Democratic-Republican Party and supported Thomas Jefferson for president in 1800. After Jefferson won, he appointed Willard as United States Marshal for Vermont, succeeding Jabez G. Fitch. Willard served until 1811, and was succeeded by David Robinson. Willard later gave up the practice of medicine for a career in farming, business and banking. He was a director of the Vermont State Bank in Middlebury in 1812 when the bank was unable to account for $28,000 in missing funds (about $418,000 in 2019). The directors and managers of the bank could not explain the shortage, and a court judgment in favor of the depositors resulted in liens against Willard's property. Emma Willard decided to open a boarding school for female students in order to generate income for the family, and Willard became the business manager. Later investigation revealed that the bank had been entered and the money stolen by means of a duplicate key. The key was found and the thief exposed, so the liens against Willard's property were removed. Despite the success of his wife's school, Willard's personal finances did not recover after the bank theft, and he was insolvent at the time of his death. In 1819, the Willards moved their female seminary to Waterford, New York after the state legislature enacted a law providing financial aid for the education of women. In 1822, they moved the Emma Willard School to Troy, New York. Willard died in Troy on May 29, 1825. He was first buried at a local cemetery in Troy, then reinterred in 1868 at Oakwood Cemetery in Troy. Family Willard first married Esther Wilcox, who died in 1788. His second wife was Mindwell Meigs (1758-1804), the widow of Thaddeus Frisbie. In 1809, Willard married Emma Hart of Middlebury. With his first wife, Willard was the father of a son, Gustavus Vasa Willard (1787-1854). With his second wife, he was the father of William Tell Willard (1796-1866), Benjamin Franklin Willard (1798-1823) and Laura. With Emma Willard, John Willard was the father of John Hart Willard (1810-1883). Willard's relatives included nephew John Willard (1792-1862). The younger John Willard was an attorney who became a prominent state court judge in New York. Legacy The Middlebury home Willard built in 1809, now known as the Emma Willard House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. It was acquired by Middlebury College and is the site of the college's admissions office.

Art practice  Marcos Chaves' art practice has been evolving since the 1980s throughout a range of works and projects spanning across media and mediums, including text, sound and video installations, assemblages, photography and site-specific projects. Mostly known and recognized through gestures of appropriation and intervention, Chaves searches for different meanings, or manoeuvres the existing ones inherent to objects, words and life- situations. His work extracts poetry and alternative representations by shifting the values of ordinary, everyday objects, landscapes and words. ‚ÄúMarcos Chaves surprises meanings and values that are immersed in vulgar things, dissimulated by habit or convention. He makes unpredictable displacements and produces assemblages in a tone of parody distilling his acute observations of the world, from technology to rubbish.‚Äù writes Brazilian art-critic Ligia Canongia  Early life and education  Marcos Chaves was born in Rio de Janeiro in January 1961 as the youngest of seven children. He grew up in the neighborhood of Santa Teresa where he continues to have his studio. As a teenager, he was very close to his aunt, Mara Chaves who worked for the architects Wilson Reis Netto and ; this triggered his training in architecture and urbanism (1979) at Universidade Santa Ursula where he attended classes with Lygia Pape who had an important influence on him. He also took classes at the Visual Arts School of Parque Lage where many of his peers taught or trained, and at the Museo de Arte Moderna where Rubens Gerchman taught him painting. In 1984, he traveled to Italy and studied art history while working as an assistant with the Italian comic artist and satirist Francesco Tullio Altan. It was from Altan from whom he learnt the value of direct humor which one finds in most of Chaves' works. While in Italy, he met Antonio Dias, an influential figure in Brazilian contemporary art, who invited him to work as his assistant in Milan. During this period he was introduced to Arte Povera artists and aesthetics, another inspiration for his later work. Upon his return to Brazil in 1985, he met , a major artist in the Brazilian scene with whom he began a regular dialogue about art. Together they experimented with four-hands paintings. During this period, Chaves developed a studio practice and started working on his first assemblages and object-based works, shifting his interest from painting to what has shaped his current conceptual, language and text-based, and photographic practice.  Important works  = Eu S√≥ Vendo A vista, 1997 (Conceptual photography)= 350x350px Marcos Chaves' most notable photographic work, Eu s√≥ vendo a vista (1997), takes as its main subject Rio de Janeiro's iconic view of the Sugar Loaf mountain found on tourist postcards and collectively associated to the landscape of the city. This view, shot from a very traditional angle becomes almost invisible for having been overly represented and used. As an attempt to restore a relationship with it, Chaves takes this image to the field of art and transposes onto it a sentence which holds many semantic ambiguities: Eu s√≥ vendo a vista. Playing around the words vista (view, eyesight), the meaning of the expression a vista (cash) as well as vendo (depending on the conjugation means selling, seeing, and concealing) one could read the different sentences: Eu s√≥, vendo a vista (with an added come or pause) = I alone or lonely, see the view. Eu s√≥ vendo a vista = I alone, sell the view / I alone sell the sight Eu s√≥ vendo a vista = I only sell the view Eu s√≥ vendo a vista = I only sell for cash This apparently simple yet highly charged conceptual work holds within it, strong statements and criticism about art, photography and the position of an artist in society, including within the art and photography fields ruled by market transactions of selling and buying views on/ of the world. By questioning the meaning of overselling Rio de Janeiro's iconic view to mere merchandise (on postcards), Chaves asserts his ownership and power to sell that view as an artist. From a sociological perspective this work dissects and determines power relations between the artist and his social space (his city and its urban fabric), the artist and his eyesight (his photographic language) as well as the artist's role in a neoliberal economy of image and photography circulation. The question of value is inherent to the work, as it alludes to a form of payment (cash) but also to images that have different economic values while they represent the same view. On the one hand a cheap reproducible postcard, while on the other, an expensive limited edition photographic artwork. This work which apparently questions the meaning and value of Rio de Janeiro's view, actually also addresses deeper meanings and values relating to the nature of a work of art and the position of the artist in an image-selling world. The play with a mental associations triggered by words is filled with humor and a hint of cynicism as in most of the artist's works. = Buracos (Holes), 1996 (photographic series)= Hole Series, 1996270x270px For the last three decades, Marcos Chaves has been photographing the holes in Rio de Janeiro's streets and the ready-made sculptures they become when residents fill them up with objects as a warning for pedestrians and cars. It is an ongoing cartographic and archival project about the city, photography, sculpture and street interventions‚Äîall at once.

It is dominated by a grotesquely over-sized mouth, fixed in a horrifying smile, which reveals two banks of yellow teeth.Laughing Mask on YouTube Laughing Mask questions the boundaries between the 'reality' of the artist as person / persona and the 'fiction' of the artwork, keeping both perceptions in play simultaneously.

He was the manager of the Indian team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, and also managed the Indian team which reached the semi-finals at the 1987 Cricket World Cup. He later served as the secretary of the Hyderabad Cricket Association. Career A right-handed batsman and off break bowler, Man Singh played five first-class matches between 1965/66 and 1968/69, representing Hyderabad in the Ranji Trophy and Hyderabad Blues in the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament. Singh became an administrator after his playing career. He worked as the assistant team manager for India on its tour to Pakistan in 1978. He was selected as the manager for the 1983 Cricket World Cup, after securing a 15‚Äì13 win over Niranjan Shah in a special BCCI general meeting vote for the post and was part of the six-member selection committee that appointed Kapil Dev as the captain for the tournament. In an interview with Sportstar, Singh admitted that he allowed four players to travel with their wives during the tournament, in violation of BCCI rules. After India's World Cup victory, Singh reportedly wrote a letter to Wisden Cricket Monthly's editor David Frith, who had downplayed India's chances before the tournament and declared that he would \\"eat his words\\" if India won the tournament, reminding him of his \\"promise\\". The September 1983 edition of the magazine ran a copy of Singh's letter along with a photograph of Frith with a piece of paper in his mouth, captioned, \\"India made me eat my words\\". Singh went on to manage the Indian team at the 1987 Cricket World Cup in the subcontinent where India reached the semi-finals. Later, he managed Hyderabad Blues in the Moin-ud- Dowlah Tournament and served as the secretary of the Hyderabad Cricket Association.

Blind from the age of two, he was the inventor of Burmese Braille. He received the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, first class, and two books were written about him after his death.  Early life  Jackson was born on 13 March 1889, at Tudor House, Greenwich, England. Known as \\"Willie\\", he was the sixth of nine children, the youngest of whom died as an infant. The family soon after moved to Stobcross Lodge, at Crooms Hill, Blackheath, where he spent his childhood. His parents were Mary Ann, n√©e Bell, and Richard Stephens Jackson a solicitor and politician who later served as a member of the United Kingdom parliament. When he was eighteen months old, one of his eyes had to be removed due to a growth. A year later the other was removed. In later life he had no recollection of ever having had sight. He learned to read Moon and then Braille, and was subsequently educated as a border at the Royal Normal College for the Blind, from where he matriculated in 1907. After being confirmed at the age of eighteen by the Suffragan Bishop of Croydon, Henry Pereira, he decided to enter the priesthood. He studied at Wadham College, Oxford, where he employed a reader, as text books were not generally available in Braille. After three years he obtained a second-class degree in modern history, and in his fourth and final year, a second-class degree in theology. He then spent a year at Leeds Theological College, resulting in his ordination in 1912.  Ministry  Holy Trinity Church, Hoxton seen in 2009 After ordination, Jackson obtained a position at St Clement's, Ilford, [Note: source has two pages numbered \\"7\\", in error. This citation refers to the first of them] where he worked for four and a half years as a curate, assisting the new vicar, who had been vice-principal during Jackson's time at Leeds. He next spent nine months in ministry at Holy Trinity, Hoxton. Jackson favoured high church or Anglo-Catholic tradition.  Burma  William Charles Bertrand Purser, a friend of Jackson's oldest brother, had obtained a position as a missionary to St. Michael's Mission, in Rangoon, Burma (then a British colony) in 1904. In 1911, Purser and Jackson's younger sister Mary were married, and she returned with her new husband to Burma. At Purser's suggestion, and at the request of the Lieutenant Governor of the colony, Jackson was invited to become a missionary in Rangoon, to develop and run a school for blind boys that Purser had established in 1914, in the suburb of Kemmendine (spellings vary; now Kyimyindaing), a position he took up in 1917. Accompanied by Purser, he sailed to Burma from Liverpool, via Gibraltar and Port Said, on the SS Burma, as part of a merchant convoy, with six destroyers to reduce the risk of attack from German submarines, as World War I was still in progress. Nonetheless, two of the ships were sunk, before reaching Port Said. During the voyage, Jackson began to learn to speak Burmese, becoming proficient within six months. He arrived on 8 November and shortly afterwards began to follow local customs, such as wearing the clothes of lower-class Burmese people, walking about barefoot and bare-headed, and eating food with his fingers. Using his existing knowledge of Braille, he developed a similar system of encoding the Burmese language using raised symbols, as Burmese Braille, [Note: source says \\"circa 1914\\", but Jackson did not arrive in Burma until November 1917] initially embossed onto sheets of metal from old petrol tins. He also adapted an old mangle as a Braille printing press. Although the system was subsequently expanded, his original ideas are still part of it. He set about designing a new school building, adapted to the needs of its blind occupants. This was completed in July 1919. As the school catered almost exclusively for boys (it had only one female pupil), Jackson assisted in the creation and running of an equivalent institution for girls, St Raphael's School at Moulmein (now Mawlamyine), some hundred miles away, which he would visit for a few days each month. In July 1920, he visited Mandalay and was influential in the creation of a school for blind children there, also. He also set up a charity, the 'Mission to the Blind of Burma', to raise funds for the Kemmendine school, with fundraising occurring both in Burma and in the United Kingdom, via an agent in London. In 1928 he hosted a delegation from the Simon Commission, who visited the school. He composed music to be performed by pupils from the school, including original hymns in Burmese, and a Christmas Cantata performed on Christmas Eve 1930. A recital of 'Original Burmese Carols', held at Rangoon's Holy Trinity Cathedral, resulted in a commission for him and the twelve-member school choir to make records which were commercially released by Columbia Records. His distinctive method of conducting blind singers was to sing ahead of them by a fraction of a beat. During trips home to England, he gave talks on BBC Radio about his missionary work, on 19 October 1923 and again on 5 August 1928, the latter being titled Why I live among the Burmese Blind. He followed the first broadcast with an article for The Radio Times, \\"Burma: The Land of Thrills\\". He also contributed to an updated edition of Cook's Guide to Burma for Thomas Cook & Son, and persuaded the publishers of Punch to produce a Braille edition of that magazine. Such was his popularity and the respect in which he was held, that Jackson was given the Burmese nickname , meaning \\"Big Father\\" or \\"Great Father\\".  Decline, honour, and death  The Kaiser-I-Hind first class (gold) medal In early 1930, Jackson returned to England on medical advice, to recuperate from an illness probably brought on by overwork. He returned to Burma later the same year. In May 1931 he again returned to England, to undergo surgery. On the arrival of his boat train at Victoria Station he was taken by ambulance directly to the London Hospital. Although he rallied after his operation, he knew that his time was short, and arranged to return again to Burma, his condition deteriorating during the voyage. Jackson had been awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, first class, in the 1930 New Year Honours. It was presented to the dying Jackson at his bedside by the then Governor of Burma, Sir Charles Innes and his wife. Jackson died a few days later, on 6 December 1931, aged 42.. His last words were reported to be \\"I shall be helping all I can on the other side\\". He was buried at Kemmendine Cemetery.  Legacy  Shortly after his death, Jackson's sister Mary wrote a book about his life, An Ambassador in Bonds. It was published in 1932 by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, with an introduction by Rollestone Fyffe, the former Bishop of Rangoon. A second, shorter, biography, Blind Eagle: Father Jackson of Burma, drawing heavily on the first, but with more on his ministry work in London, was written by Stanley Sowton in 1950. A bronze memorial plaque commemorating Jackson was erected inside Holy Trinity Cathedral in Yangon, and is extant. The School for the Blind Kyimyindine, as it is now known, is still in operation. After Jackson's death it was operated by The Mission of St. Michael until 1 November 1963, when the Department of Social Welfare, part of the Myanmar Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, took it on. In 2011, software to read and write the Burmese Braille first devised by Jackson was developed by a computer technician at the school.

She helped to establish the Odense branches of both the Women's Suffrage Association in 1889 and the Women's Society in 1890. In the early 1890s, she was one of the strongest advocates for having women's voting rights adopted as part of the Odense organization's programme, years before the Women's Society included the right to vote in their national programme in 1906. Biography Born in Middelfart on 15 August 1849, Frida Frederikke Caroline Christiane Schmidt was the fourth of 10 children parented by the lawyer and district attorney Lorentz Lorentzen Schmidt (1816‚Äì1867) and his wife Elisabeth Vanting (1819‚Äì1902). On matriculating from school in 1864, unusually for her times, she worked in her father's office, taking dictation and handling correspondence. Mocked by the firm's customers and unable to witness documents, she became aware of the second-class status imposed on women. She learnt of the cause for women's rights through Ida Falbe-Hansen and the works of Henrik Ibsen. In 1867, she trained as a teacher in Copenhagen's N. Zahle's School, heading Mathiasen's Girls School in Middelfart in 1873. In 1980, she moved with her parents to Odense but had difficulty in finding a teaching post. As a result, she taught languages at N. Zahle's School, eventually opening a private school with one of her sisters in Odense. Known as Eugenie Schmidts Handelsskole (Eugenie Schmidt's Commercial College), she taught there for 34 years, introducing a completely new subject, social studies. She helped to establish the Odense branches of both the Women's Suffrage Association in 1889 and the Women's Society in 1890.

Some sources render his first name as Mazarak or Zemarak.  Personal life and appearance  Mazrak was the eldest of the 9 or 18 sons of Babrak Khan, who was the Zadran chieftain at the time of Mazrak's birth. Among Mazrak's brothers was Saad Akbar Babrak. Mazrak's winter home was in the village of Almara. His appearance in 1951 was described as a \\"thickset man with a black beard\\" who \\"wore a brown embroidered woollen chugha (cloak) over his shalwar qamiz\\". In 1972, he was described as a \\"typical rugged Pathan, confident of his appearance and bearing, soft-spoken, with an air of self- acquired nobility. He was in light brown shalwar kameez, black high Liaquat cap, black shoes, dyed beard and moustache.\\"  Chieftain  Mazrak came to power following his father's death. He supported the restoration of Amanullah Khan, a king of Afghanistan who was deposed in the Afghan Civil War. A Pakistani enquiry in 1947 states that \\"after the present dynasty seized the throne of Kabul, Mazarak, the elder brother of Said Akbar, was given the rank of Naib Salar.\\" Mazrak (left) with his father, Babrak. Picture taken 1925 or earlier. In April 1944, Mazrak led an ambush against government troops in the Southern province, after which he was beaten back and forced to retreat into the hills. He continued to fight the Afghan government for the following years. In late 1944, he invaded the British Raj, where he was joined by a Sultan Ahmed, a chieftain from Balochistan. They were later joined by another rebel leader nicknamed Pak. However, Mazrak's fortunes were not to last. He was forced out of British territory due to British bombardment. In October 1945, most Safi surrendered, followed by the surrender of Sultan Ahmad in November. Nonetheless, Mazrak and his brother Sher Muhd Khan continued to fight, refusing to surrender until 11 January 1947. Mazrak was expelled from Afghanistan by the government and was favourably received by the authorities in the British Raj.  Succession  In Political conspiracies in Pakistan, written in 1969, it is stated that the Zadran chieftain at the time was Abdulla Khan Jadran Yawan, although it's unclear if succession was immediate or if someone else was chieftain between Mazrak and Abdulla.  Exile and later life  By 2 April 1948, Mazrak and his brother Saad had been interned in Kahil, Abbottabad, in houses no. 3000 and 3259 respectively, under the provisions of Regulation III of 1818. On that day, Ghulam Sarwar, Deputy Commissioner, wrote to the Superintendent of Police letter No. 4938/30.20, requesting him to keep a close watch on and occasionally report their activities. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948, Mazrak (who was still imprisoned) allegedly encouraged his followers to join the Azad Kashmir Regular Force to \\"free Kashmir from Hindu rule\\". On 16 October 1951, Mazrak's brother, Saad Akbar Babrak, shot and killed Liaquat Ali Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan. Shortly after, Mazrak was interned in the Police Reserve Inspector's vacant bungalow, and would remain interned there for \\"quite some time\\". He alleged that prior to his brother's assassination of Liaqat Ali Khan, he had been offered ¬£1400 by \\"certain Afghan officials\\" to kill Liaqat, but that he had turned down the offer. In 1972, Mazrak, who was still in Abbottabad, was interviewed by Zubair Qureshi on his brother's assassination of Liaqat Ali Khan. Mazrak insisted that his brother did not kill the Prime Minister and stated that he was still getting a stipend ($255 monthly) from the Pakistani government which was his only source of income and which was enough for his living and occasional trips to holiday resorts. His preferred summer escape was Shogran in the Kaghan Valley.

The complex includes a church and attached bell-tower with an adjacent but separate baptistry. History A paleochristian church at the site was built here in the 5th century, putatively atop an Ancient Roman temple dedicated to Diana. The site then was adjacent to a Christian cemetery, but the present cemetery is now separated railroad tracks and the SS4 highway. The structures underwent various restorations including in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries. Documents note a reconstructed Santa Maria was reconsecrated in 1054 by Gerard, then Bishop of Rieti; and in 1178 under the rule of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, was again rebuilt. In 1154, the church is mentioned by a bull of Pope Anastasius IV. The exterior is made of brick and local gray stone. The portal with columns and pilasters has stone designs of animals and plants. Above the portal is a round oculus. The interior has three naves, leading to a semicircular apse. The attached bell- tower has mullioned windows, showing restoration occurring over centuries. The interior wall of the apse is frescoed with a Redeemer Blessing. Among the other frescoes is a Marriage of St Catherine of Alexandria (early 15th century).

Whereas Droplaugarsona saga details the descendants of Helgi Droplaugarson, Brandkrossa √æ√°ttr focuses on the forebears of his enemy Helgi Asbjarnarson, including his father Asbjorn, son of Hrafnkel, the subject of Hrafnkels saga. Although beginning with Hrafnkel, the author of Brandkrossa √æ√°ttr does not appear to have known Hrafnkels saga and used a version of Landn√°mab√≥k as a source instead. The √æ√°ttr takes its name from Brandkrossi, an ox owned by Gr√≠mr, ancestor of the sons of Droplaug. The √æ√°ttr falls into two part, the second of which is more fantastic. One day Gr√≠mr's ox Brandkrossi flies into a rage and swims out to sea. Gr√≠mr travels to Norway where he meets Geitir, whose father was a troll. Gr√≠mr marries Geitir's daughter Droplaug, and it is revealed that it was Geitir who caused Brandkrossi to disappear. Geitir sends Gr√≠mr away with many gifts including the hide of Brandkrossi stuffed with grain. A version of this episode is told in Flj√≥tsd√¶la saga and has parallels with the giant episodes in Kjalnesinga saga and H√°lfdanar √æ√°ttr svarta. The √æ√°ttr survives in paper manuscripts, the earliest from the 17th century, all of which stem from a now lost manuscript. Finlay suggests that as Brandkrossa √æ√°ttr is likely to have been associated with Droplaugarsona saga in manuscripts, the source for these paper copies is probably AM 162c fol, a single leaf which contains a fragment of Droplaugarsona saga.

The 23 line trips are roughly 20 minutes during peak hours, 30 minutes during off peak hours, and 60 minutes on Sundays. This line provides service from Tysons Corner in Fairfax County to Ballston and Crystal City of Arlington County. Route description and service The 23A, 23B, and 23T operate out of Four Mile Run Division 7 days a week. Route 23A only operates during late nights daily and early mornings on Saturdays and Sundays. The 23A runs the full route between Tysons Corner Center and Crystal City. The 23A also runs through other neighborhoods such as McLean, Rock Springs, Buckingham, Nauck, Parkfairfax, Arlington Ridge, and Aurora Highlands. Routes 23B and 23T operate on daily schedules with the same intervals, with transfers between Ballston station and Shirlington Transit Center. The 23B operates between Ballston station and Crystal City station, while the 23T operates between Tysons Corner Center and Shirlington Transit Center. History The McLean‚ÄìCrystal City Line was introduced in 1934, under the Glebe Road Line, as the route was part of the Washington Virginia & Maryland Coach Company. It was later operated by WMATA in 1973, when it acquired all routes from the WV&M.; Since 1973, the McLean‚ÄìCrystal City Line consists of all 23 line. Some 23 routes were split into different lines, to run as a sister line which brings faster service between rush hours. The 23 line runs along Dolley Madison Boulevard, Old Dominion Drive, and Glebe Road, connecting to the neighborhoods of Fairfax and Arlington Counties, alongside with the neighborhoods of the City of Alexandria. Route 23A initially started as a daily service route, which runs the full route all day. Route 23C was added to operate between the Langley CIA Headquarters and Crystal City, although, select 23C trips terminates at the Village at Shirlington. The 23C only operates during rush hour, bringing faster service between the neighborhood of McLean and Crystal City. Starting on September 24, 2005, bus transfers from Langley are no longer accepted due to security restrictions. The 23C bus time was not affected following the addition of the transfer restriction. Service changes to the McLean‚ÄìCrystal City Line wasn't changed until March 30, 2014. The 23A now ends at Tysons Corner Center instead of the Tysons-Westpark Transit Station. The 23A was also rerouted from Chain Bridge Road, to Dolley Madison Boulevard, to bring new service for the Silver Line, which opened on July 26, 2014. Two new routes was added to the line, the 23B & 23T. The 23B and 23T replaced the 23A rush hour service, although neither the two routes serves Langley resulting the discontinuation of the 23C. The remaining 23A portion between Tysons-Westpark Transit Station and Tysons Corner Center was served by route 23W of the Westpark Shuttle Line to serve as a temporary route to run through Tysons Galleria until the Silver Line opens. Since 2016, the 23B and 23T runs on daily service, as the 23A runs on late nights and early mornings. =2010 proposed changes= In 2010 during WMATA's FY2011 budget, WMATA proposed to eliminate route 23C and replace it with route 23A. This was due to bus transfer being restricted at Langley, as riders will have to stop at Old Dominion Drive and Chain Bridge Road to transfer to the 15K or 15L of the Chain Bridge Road Line. With the 23C being proposed to be converted to the 23A, service at Douglas Park, which operates via Walter Reed Drive and Arlington Mill Drive, would be discontinued. Arlington Transit route 77 will continue to provide service on Douglas Park, following the same path as the 23C, although ART 77 will split on South Glebe Road to continue straight towards Court House station. =2013 proposed changes= In 2013, WMATA proposed to reconstruct the 23 line, by revising the 23A and add a new route, the 23T. The 23A will be rerouted to operate via Dolley Madison Boulevard instead of Chain Bridge Road, to serve Salona Village Shopping Center at McLean. With the new Silver Line service planned to open in 2014, the 23A will serve McLean station and Tysons Corner station, however, it will now terminate at Tysons Corner Shopping Center, no longer serving Tysons- Westpark Transit Station via Tysons Galleria. Since route 23C was still in service during the proposal, it was omitted from the reconstructive plan for the 23 line. Although the 15K and 15L was still mentioned as an alternate route for Langley, as both routes operates via Chain Bridge Road where the 23A will no longer operate, the 23C is most likely being proposed to be eliminated. The reason why WMATA planned these changes was to clear up bus bunching with Fairfax Connector on Chain Bridge Road, as those routes operates nearly the same path as the 23A. =March 2014 changes= To make way for the Silver Line, the 23A was truncated from Tysons-Westpark Transit Station to Tysons Corner Center March 30, 2014. 23B & 23T were introduced March 30, 2014 replacing the 23C. Alternate service to Langley is provided by routes 15K and 15L at the neighborhood of McLean. A temporary 23W was added to serve as a shuttle bus between Tysons-Westpark Transit Station and Tysons Corner Center, until the Silver line opens. The 23W runs under the Westpark Shuttle Line. =June 2016 changes= Starting on June 26, 2016, weekday middays, evenings & weekends was added to routes 23B & 23T , replacing most of the route 23A service. 23A now operates only during the early mornings and late nights. =December 2018 changes= Due to the West Glebe Road bridge construction, service will be rerouted via West Glebe Road at the City of Alexandria on December 30, 2018. Routes 23A and 23B no longer operates through Avalon Bay at South Glebe Road. =2020 changes= In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, routes 23A, 23B, and 23T went on major service modification to simplify routes. The line operated on its Sunday schedule during the pandemic. The 23A, 23B and 23T weekend service was also suspended to limit its service. WMATA later announced to restore the line on August 23, 2020 as part of the Metro‚Äôs COVID-19 Recovery Plan. However, some changes were made on the line, with the 23A operating on full weekdays, and the 23B and 23T only operating during weekends. This marks the 23A operating on full day for the first time since 2016, when the 23A was replaced by the 23B and 23T. No route segment changes was made, as the 23A retains the same intervals and same stops as the late night schedules. = September 2020 proposed changes = On September 10, 2020 as part of its FY2022 proposed budget, WMATA proposed to reduce all weekend frequencies on routes 23A, 23B, and 23T service in order to reduce costs and low federal funds. Incidents * On October 4, 2010, a pick-up truck ran into the side of a 23A bus South Glebe Road near the interchange with I-395. Two people from the truck were sent to a hospital with no injuries reported on the bus.

The city was part of the wider Abbasid Caliphate, and had a multiethnic population.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 121-123 The historian Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi (10th century) reports that the earthquake affected the royal residence at Dvin. He dates the earthquake as following the death of Ashot Bagratuni, the prince of princes. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 121-123 According to Hovhannes' narrative the earthquake caused great amage to the city's houses, the defensive walls, and the palaces. The tremors caused desolation within the city. Many people perished in the initial earthquake.

He reports that tremors lasted for three months. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 121-123 The historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi (10th to 11th century) instead claimed that the tremors lasted for a whole year.

In the Byzantine liturgical calendar, the feast day of Demetrius of Thessaloniki is on 26 October, not 13 February. There are two earthquakes in Constantinople which were dated on the feast day of Demetrius of Thessaloniki, one dated to 26 October, 740 and the other to 26 October, 989. Both earthquakes were commemorated in the Byzantine liturgy. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 121-123 The historian Tovma Artsruni (11th century) compared this earthquake to the 893 Dvin earthquake, reporting that it was less severe than its 893 counterpart. He dates the earlier earthquake to the term of Zacharias I of Armenia as Catholicos of all Armenmians. He also dates the earthquake to the seventh year of the Armenian captivity. This would correspond to years 859 and 860 of Anno Domini.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 121-123 The historian Samuel Aneci (12th century) dates the earthquake to year 312 of the Armenian calendar. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 121-123 In primary sources, the earthquake is variously dated to between 861 and 869. The uncertainty of the chronology may have been based on the different chronological systems in use within Arab-dominated Armenia. The Medieval historians had difficulty in establishing an exact date for this earthquake.
