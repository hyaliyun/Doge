The entire route lies in Arctic waters and within Russia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Parts are free of ice for only two months per year. The overall route on Russia's side of the Arctic between North Cape and the Bering Strait has been called the Northeast Passage, analogous to the Northwest Passage on the Canada side. While the Northeast Passage includes all the East Arctic seas and connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Northern Sea Route does not include the Barents Sea, and it therefore does not reach the Atlantic. Melting Arctic ice caps are likely to increase traffic in and the commercial viability of the Northern Sea Route. One study, for instance, projects \\"remarkable shifts in trade flows between Asia and Europe, diversion of trade within Europe, heavy shipping traffic in the Arctic and a substantial drop in Suez traffic. Projected shifts in trade also imply substantial pressure on an already threatened Arctic ecosystem.\\" History The route was first conquered by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld's expedition. The Northern Sea Route is one of several Arctic shipping routes. Since the mid-1930s the Northern Sea Route has been an officially managed and administered shipping route along the northern/Arctic coast of Russia. The administrative entity was sequentially updated, upgraded, and renamed. Its current incarnation was the Federal State Budgetary Institution's establishment of The Northern Sea Route Administration in 2013. In August 2017, the first ship traversed the Northern Sea Route without the use of icebreakers. According to the New York Times, this forebodes more shipping through the Arctic, as the sea ice melts and makes shipping easier. In 2018 Maersk Line sent the new \\"ice-class\\" container ship Venta Maersk through the route to gather data on operational feasibility, though they did not currently see it as commercially attractive. Escort assistance was required for three days from the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker . The Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis projected in 2015 that the Northern Sea Route may be ice-free by 2030, earlier than the Northwest Passage or Transpolar Sea Route. A 2016 report by the Copenhagen Business School found that large-scale trans- Arctic shipping may become economically viable by 2040. In 2018 the Russian government transferred the main responsibility for the Northern Sea Route to Rosatom which through its ROSATOMFLOT subsidiary manages the Russian nuclear powered icebreaker fleet based in Murmansk.

Where applicable, native rulers are also listed. For the purposes of these lists, a current dependency is any entity listed on these lists of dependent territories and other entities. A dependent territory is normally a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state yet remains politically outside the controlling state's integral area. This latter condition distinguishes a dependent territory from an autonomous region or administrative division, which forms an integral part of the parent state. The administrators of uninhabited territories are excluded.

It was a 1991 finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and was later made into a film in 1993; Mandy Patinkin played Nashe and James Spader played Pozzi. Plot summary Jim Nashe is a fireman with a two-year-old daughter and wife who has just left him. Knowing he cannot work and raise a child at the same time, he sends her to live with his sister. Six months of sporadic visits pass and Nashe realizes that his daughter, Juliet, has begun to forget him. Suddenly, the father that abandoned Nashe as a child dies, leaving his children a large amount of money. Nashe, knowing that Juliet will be happier with her aunt, pays off all of his debts, buys a Saab and pursues \\"a life of freedom\\" by spending a year driving back and forth across the country. His fortune now squandered, Nashe picks up a hot-headed young gambler named Jack Pozzi. The two hatch a plan to fleece a couple of wealthy bachelors named Flower and Stone in a poker game. In addition to purchasing a mansion, the two eccentrics also bought ten thousand stones, from the ruins of a fifteenth-century Irish castle destroyed by Oliver Cromwell; Flower and Stone intend to use them to build a \\"Wailing Wall\\" in the meadow behind their mansion. Flower and Stone are not the suckers Pozzi takes them for and the plan backfires. Having run out of money Nashe decides to risk everything on \\"a single blind turn of a card\\" and puts up his car as collateral against the pot. He loses and the two indenture themselves to Flower and Stone as a way to pay back their debt. They will build the wall for Flower and Stone, a meaningless wall that nobody will ever see. For the rest of the novel, Flower and Stone are conspicuously absent. Nashe shrugs this off as fifty days of exercise, but Pozzi views it as nothing less than a violation of human decency. The two men are watched over by Calvin Murks, the millionaires' tough but amiable hired man. When Pozzi takes a swing at Murks for cracking a joke about being too smart to play cards, Murks begins wearing a gun. Pozzi sees this as proof that he is nothing but a slave. Even after the two men have completed working off their debt, the millionaires add on the food and entertainment charges the men have accrued as a result of living at the estate. Pozzi, convinced there is no way out of the contract, escapes the meadow. Days later Nashe finds his young friend sprawled on the grass beaten into a coma. Murks claims innocence and tells Nashe he took Pozzi to a hospital. Two weeks later, Murks tells Nashe that Pozzi checked himself out of the hospital and vanished, but Nashe is convinced that his friend is dead. Time passes, the wall grows as does Nashe's obsession with taking revenge on Murks. When Nashe has completed enough work on the wall to pay off his debt, Murks and his son-in-law Floyd take Nashe out to celebrate. Nashe beats Floyd in a game of pool, but refuses the fifty dollars he has won; Floyd accepts this, saying that he owes Nashe a favor. Soon after, the three men pile into Murks's new car (Nashe's old Saab) with the slightly more sober Nashe behind the wheel. Nashe promptly takes the car up to eighty-five miles an hour and deliberately collides, head-on into an oncoming vehicle. Influence The Music of Chance was referred to in David Mitchell's 1999 novel Ghostwritten, which also deals with the nature of random chance.

Chandler (born June 6, 1970) is a Canadian businessman, pundit, and political and religious activist, with social conservative views such as those expressed when he expressed negative opinions regarding Alberta legislation permitting Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) throughout provincial schools. He is a co-founder and executive director of the Progressive Group for Independent Business. He was a candidate at the federal 2003 Progressive Conservative leadership convention and has also been a candidate for Member of Parliament in Ontario and Member of the Legislative Assembly in Alberta. Political career=Early political experience= As an undergraduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in the late 1980s, Chandler joined the Reform Party of Canada, where he was active as an organizer and fund-raiser. In the 1993 federal election, Chandler ran as a Reform Party candidate in the riding of Hamilton Mountain, at the age of 23 finishing in a distant second place with 10,297 votes, behind Liberal incumbent Beth Phinney, who received 27,218. Chandler moved to Alberta in 1995. He ran in the 1997 provincial election as a candidate for the Social Credit Party of Alberta in the riding of Calgary West, finishing with 1,100 votes, or 7.5% of the electorate. He later rejoined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and endorsed United Alternative candidate Brian Pallister in the party's 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. In 2000, Chandler's Progressive Group for Independent Business (PGIB) supported the creation of the Canadian Alliance. In 2002, ChandlerElliott, Louise. \\"Christian group backing Harper is for-profit business run by lobbyist.\\" Canadian Press Newswire. March 3, 2002 and the PGIB backed Stephen Harper's successful bid for the leadership of the Alliance.\\"Controversy has followed Christian lobbyist for Harper,\\" Guelph Mercury, March 4, 2002 =Federal politics= In 2003, Chandler joined the Progressive Conservative Party and became a candidate for the party's leadership, running on a platform of creating a coalition between the PC and Alliance party caucuses. He withdrew prior to voting and endorsed Calgary lawyer Jim Prentice, who also supported cooperation between the parties. James Muldoon, a fundraiser for front runner Peter MacKay, described Chandler as \\"the true black face of neoconservatism. He could live to be 100 and he'll never know the meaning of, I am my brother's keeper.\\"Salutin, Rick, \\"Troublesome Tories\\", Maclean's Magazine, June 16, 2003 Chandler's statements were called \\"bitter and resentful\\" by MacKay, whom Chandler criticized for supporting of the passage of Bill C-250, which amended the Criminal Code by adding sexual orientation as a protected category under the Code offences prohibiting advocating genocide and publicly inciting hatred. Chandler suggested that the amendment would lead to the banning of the Bible and other religious texts in schools and public libraries. Chandler also called for a formal union of the PC and CA parties, advocating an electoral coalition between the two parties that would eventually lead to a merger. Chandler proposed that: * Currently elected PC and CA MPs would run uncontested for their nominations and stand as sole right-of-centre candidates in their respective ridings in the next election; * Liberal Party, New Democratic Party or Bloc Québécois ridings where the PCs ran closest to first-place in the 2000 election would have a PC candidate running as the sole right-of-centre choice in the next election and vice versa for ridings where CA candidates came closest to first-place. * After the next election, the elected parliamentary caucuses of both parties would work towards a full-fledged merger. At the end of his speech Chandler was complimentary of the leadership qualities of his competitors David Orchard and Scott Brison, before endorsing and pledging support to Calgary lawyer Jim Prentice's leadership bid to the astonishment of many delegates in attendance.\\"Tory leadership race down to four candidates\\", CBC News, May 30, 2003 With the exception of statements in one debate on CPAC where he openly apologized to the citizens of the United States for the Government of Canada's unwillingness to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, his candidacy was largely ignored by the media until the last days of the campaign. Chandler admitted in The Globe and Mail and the National Post (May 29, 2003) that he had never tried to seriously contest the leadership of the PC Party, but had instead served as a voice for the Progressive Group for Independent Business (PGIB) and their United Alternative efforts. PGIB donated $250,000 to Chandler's bid. After the Tory leadership race, Chandler quickly receded from the public eye. He resurfaced briefly during the 2004 federal election, and during the March 2005 Conservative Party of Canada policy convention in Montreal. Both times he criticized Tory leader Stephen Harper's ambiguous position on freedom of speech for evangelical Christians, same-sex marriage, and civil union rights for common-law couples. Chandler also suggested that he resented Harper's attempts to \\"shut-up\\" socially conservative MPs.\\"Doubts cast by Conservatives themselves about voting Conservative\\", CTV News, June 11, 2004 In 1997, Chandler established a religious lobby group Concerned Christians Canada Inc. to rally support for Evangelical candidates, MPs and causes. Chandler's present connections to this group are unknown. In February 2005, Chandler suggested on CBC Newsworld that he would be campaigning for the Conservative Party nomination in the next election in the riding of Calgary North Centre, then represented by Conservative MP Jim Prentice. This choice of riding was believed to be motivated by Prentice's continuing votes supporting same-sex marriage in Canada and, presumably, Chandler's opposition to this legislation. A contest for the nomination was precluded when the March CPC Policy Convention in Montreal voted in favour of allowing sitting Tory MPs to gain their nominations uncontested in minority government scenarios, where elections are less predictable. Chandler wrote a controversial pre-Tory convention article for the March 15, 2005 issue of the Globe and Mail newspaper in which he criticized pro same-sex marriage MP Belinda Stronach, then a Conservative, as \\"a well-known liberal who has successfully infiltrated the new Conservative Party of Canada.\\" He reiterated his statements on Stronach in a 2005 cover article on Belinda Stronach in Maclean's Magazine.George, Lianne, \\"Belinda billions\\" , Maclean's Magazine, April 13, 2005 Stronach later crossed the floor to the Liberal Party of Canada. In an interview on the program CBC News: The Hour with host George Stroumboulopoulos, Chandler suggested that Stronach's discomfort with the new Tory party's policies was a sign that the new Conservatives would not be \\"just another liberal party,\\" and that her defection was \\"a victory for family values supporters\\". =Alberta provincial politics= Chandler, who is from Ontario, but moved to Alberta by choice in 1995, caused controversy in August 2007 for comments stating, \\"You came to here to enjoy our economy, our natural beauty and more. This is our home and if you wish to live here, you must adapt to our rules and our voting patterns or leave. Conservatism is our culture. Do not destroy what we have created.\\" This statement was strongly criticized by some, including the Premier of Alberta, Ed Stelmach.\\"Alberta newcomers told to accept conservatism or leave\\", Globe and Mail, August 30, 2007 In the fall of 2007, Chandler sought the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta (PCAA) nomination of Calgary- Egmont for the up-coming Alberta provincial election. Soon after winning the contest with a massive majority, Premier Stelmach and the PCAA Executive reviewed Chandler's candidacy.Bell, Rick, Controversial Tory candidate Craig Chandler's political career is on life support, waiting for Stelmach to decide whether to pull the plug\\", Calgary Sun, November 23, 2007 One concern was Chandler's association with a conservative Christian organization (the Concerned Christian Coalition), a group vocally opposed to Same Sex Marriage at the time this debate was occurring. Chandler had been CEO of the organization when a letter was published in the Red Deer Advocate in 2002 by a member of that organization (Rev. Stephen Boissoin). In that letter (\\"Homosexual Agenda Wicked\\") Boisson, not Craig Chandler, suggested that homosexuals were as immoral as pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps, and that gay activists were \\"perverse, morally deprived individuals who are spreading their psychological disease\\". After numerous complaints the matter was referred to the Alberta Human Rights Commission (AHRC). During the Commission's hearing in July 2007 Boissoin testified that Chandler was aware of the letter and supported him.\\"Pastor, Christian coalition violated human rights law, Alberta panel rules\\", CBC News, November 30, 2007 On November 30, 2007, the AHRC ruled that the letter broke provincial human rights law and exposed gays to hatred and contempt. In the 81-page decision, Lori Andreachuk of the AHRC wrote \\"In my view, it is clear that the letter expresses hatred or contempt for a group of persons on the basis of their sexual preference\\".Walton, Dawn \\"Panel denounces ex-pastor's anti-gay comments\\", Globe and Mail, December 1, 2007\\"Pastor, Christian coalition violated human rights law, Alberta panel rules\\", CBC News, November 30, 2007 Walton, Dawn, \\"Panel denounces ex-pastor's anti-gay comments\\", The Globe and Mail, December 1, 2007 Prior to the decision and as part of a settlement with the CHRC (not AHRC since websites are under Federal jurisdiction), Chandler agreed to remove the letter from websites he controlled and further agreed to \\"cease and desist\\" from posting messages on the internet stating that homosexuals conspire against society, are sick, diseased or mentally ill, and want to have sex with children.Bell, Rick, \\"Tories boot Chandler\\", Calgary Sun, December 2, 2007 As part of the settlement with the AHRC, Chandler was required to post a formal apology on his website http://www.freedomradionetwork.ca/content/news/robWellsApology.htm > as well as the terms of the settlement. In December 2009, the ruling was overturned in Lund v. Boissoin on free speech grounds. Craig Chandler stepped down from seeking the nomination for the PCAA in Calgary Shaw at the request of the PC party. On December 1, 2007, during a closed meeting of the PCAA's Forty Five member Executive, chaired by Premier Stelmach, Chandler spent two hours outlining why his nomination for the provincial riding of Calgary-Egmont should be endorsed. The Executive voted to revoke Chandler's candidacy despite his overwhelming victory, with Premier Stelmach subsequently stating that having Chandler stand in the riding was \\"not in the best interests of the party\\". \\"I have always been a strong believer in human rights\\" said the premier.\\"Alberta Tories oust candidate linked to anti-gay controversy\\", The Globe and Mail, December 1, 2007Bell, Rick, \\"Tories boot Chandler\\", The Calgary Sun, December 2, 2007Bell, Rick, \\"Controversial Tory candidate Craig Chandler's political career is on life support, waiting for Stelmach to decide whether to pull the plug\\", The Calgary Sun, November 23, 2007 Chandler responded the same day by quitting the PCAA, stating \\"I'm not going to belong to a party that doesn't want me.\\"Macdonald, Jim, \\"Alberta Tories oust candidate linked to anti-gay controversy\\", Canadian Press, December 1, 2007 In the 2008 Alberta election held on March 3, Chandler ran as an independent candidate in the Calgary-Egmont riding against Jonathan Denis, his replacement as the Tory candidate, and Liberal Cathie Williams.Walton, Dawn and O'Neill, Katherine, \\"Ridings to watch\\", Globe and Mail, February 4, 2008 Chandler was widely expected to run as a candidate for the new Wildrose Alliance Party of Alberta but was defeated in his attempt to win election to the new party's board of directors.McCoy, Heath, \\"New party to field full slate\\" , Calgary Herald, February 6, 2008 In the provincial election Chandler finished in third place with 2008 votes (16.2%), well behind Cathie Williams, the Liberal Party candidate, with 3289 votes (26.5%). The Progressive Conservative candidate (Jonathan Denis) won with 43.6% of the vote (5415 votes). \\"2008 General Election Statements of Official Results Chandler has spent an estimated $150,000 in his candidacy for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta but the final campaign return indicated he had only spent $13,045.Candidate Campaign Period Return: Craig Chandler =Campaign management= Chandler claims to have managed 48 campaigns, presumably nominations, leadership races, municipal, provincial and federal elections. In November 2004 during the 2004 Alberta election, Craig Chandler managed the campaign of David Crutcher, an Alberta Alliance Party candidate in Calgary-Egmont. Crutcher was not elected, winning 1,657 votes, or 14% of the total. Notably, David Crutcher received more votes than any other Alliance candidate in an urban riding. In 2005, David Crutcher ran for the leadership of the Alberta Alliance and Chandler managed his leadership campaign. Crutcher placed third out of four candidates. Chandler also managed the successful campaign of MLA Art Johnston.Olsen, Tom, \\"No small job ahead for new party leader\\", Calgary Herald, November 20, 2005 He was also the campaign manager for Calgary Ward 14 winning alderman Peter Demong, and briefly served as his constituency assistant.https://calgaryherald.com/news/Contentious+landfill+donates+Calgary+alderman/3950199/story.html Most recently, Chandler also managed the losing, third place race of Jon Lord for the Conservative Party nomination in Calgary Centre and produced victories for Councillor Shane Keating, Peter Demong and Joe Magliocca in the 2013 Calgary civic election. On April 29, 2016, Chandler resigned as a member of the PC board of directors after accusing Earls (a Canadian restaurant chain facing criticism for switching from Canadian beef to an American company because they could supply \\"certified humane\\" meat) on Facebook of supporting terrorism because Earls' chosen supplier, Creekstone Farms, offered a Halal- certified option. Chandler claimed fees paid by companies to ensure they are compliant with halal standards were going to Saudi Arabia and are being used to fund terrorist activities.https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/controversial-activist- chandler-steps-down-from-pc-board In the media Chandler was involved in a documentary film titled, God Only Knows: Same Sex Marriage, which aired on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television's The Lens (February 2006)GOD ONLY KNOWS: SAME SEX MARRIAGE, The Lens, February 7, 2006, accessed January 29, 2008 program. In the documentary, Chandler and Dylan Crozier, a gay pastor from Vancouver, each spent a week walking in the other person's shoes. Chandler was the host of a Calgary radio show called Freedom Radio Network (the \\"FRN\\" on CHRB-AM Calgary). In August 2006 a complaint was received by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council about Chandler's radio program, alleging, among other things, that the program made repeated abusive comments likely to expose persons or groups to hatred and contempt on the basis of sexual orientation, that it broadcast false and misleading news, and that the program was used to retaliate and threaten retaliation for making a human rights complaint. In January 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council reached a decision in the complaint. The Panel concluded that a broadcast on July 29, 2006 was in violation of Clause 6 (\\"Full, Fair and Proper Presentation\\") and Clause 7 (\\"Controversial Public Issues\\") of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of Ethics, but not Clause 2 (\\"Human Rights\\"). The Panel's decision, which CHRB-AM was required to announce on-air and in writing, was as follows: :\\"The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council has found that CHRB-AM breached provisions of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of Ethics in its broadcast of an episode of Freedom Radio on July 29, 2006. Because of the cumulative effect of a series of incorrect, distorted or exaggerated comments about a private individual, the CBSC has found that CHRB breached Clause 6 of the CAB Code of Ethics, which requires the full, fair and proper presentation of opinion, editorial or other comment. Because of the one-sided commitment of nearly an entire episode of the program against that private figure and boasting that it would disregard any court decisions rendered in his favour, the CBSC has found that CHRB breached Clause 7 of the CAB Code of Ethics, which requires the fair treatment of all subjects of a controversial nature.\\" He ran the Chandler Radio Network on 88.9 Shine FM. Helping Tories in 2015 Election The Alberta PC party announced that Chandler had withdrawn his candidacy for the PC nomination in Calgary-Shaw to help the Tories in the upcoming 2015 Alberta provincial election.https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/delong-and-dallas-the-latest- tories-to-pull-the-plug ReferencesExternal links *Campaign webpage *Radio program *CBC News coverage of Chandler's campaign and convention speech *Globe and Mail article \\"The Right Way for Stephen Harper\\" by Chandler *CBC Newsworld: The Lens -

The current meaning (ore vein) dates from the 17th century, being an expansion of an earlier sense of a \\"channel, watercourse\\" in late Middle English, which in turn is from the 11th-century meaning of lode as a ‘course, way’. The generally accepted hydrothermal model of lode deposition posits that metals dissolved in hydrothermal solutions (hot spring fluids) deposit the gold or other metallic minerals inside the fissures in the pre- existing rocks. Lode deposits are distinguished primarily from placer deposits, where the ore has been eroded out from its original depositional environment and redeposited by sedimentation. A third process for ore deposition is as an evaporite. A stringer lode is one in which the rock is so permeated by small veinlets that rather than mining the veins, the entire mass of ore and the enveined country rock is mined. It is so named because of the irregular branching of the veins into many anastomosing stringers, so that the ore is not separable from the country rock.

It was directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Joe Pasternak with Jesse L. Lasky as associate producer from a screenplay by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig. The original music was by Johnny Green and the cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg. Costume design was by Helen Rose and Gile Steele. The film is a highly fictionalized biography of the life of Caruso.

Factual discrepancies Though the film follows the basic facts of Caruso's life, the story is largely fictional. The Caruso family successfully sued MGM for damages because of this. Here are a few of the factual discrepancies: * Early in the film, the young Caruso is shown in a montage rising through the ranks from operatic chorister to supporting singer, including singing the secondary role of Spoletta in Puccini's opera Tosca. Caruso never sang in an opera chorus, nor did he ever sing a supporting role. When Tosca premiered in January 1900, Caruso was already a rising international opera star and had been considered by Puccini himself for the starring tenor role of Cavaradossi, though the part was given to another tenor, Emilio De Marchi. When Caruso first sang the role of Cavaradossi in Bologna later that year, Puccini stated that he had never heard the part better sung. * In the film, Caruso makes his American debut at the Metropolitan Opera in Verdi's Aida and is met with silence from the audience and scathing critical reviews. In reality, Caruso's Met debut in Rigoletto and was well received, and he became an immediate favorite with New York audiences and critics. * Although the events in the film follow no clear timeline, in real life Caruso met his future wife Dorothy Park Benjamin in 1917 and married her the following year; in the film, he appears to meet her at the time of his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1903 (In reality, Dorothy Benjamin would have been only ten years old in 1903), and marries her after returning to New York from a long world tour which appears to last for several years. In actuality, Caruso never made any such lengthy \\"world tour\\"; while he did frequently perform in Europe, South America and other countries, the Metropolitan Opera was Caruso's artistic home, regularly singing there each season from 1903 to 1920. * In reality, Caruso fathered two sons with Italian soprano Ada Giachetti, during a relationship which lasted from 1898 to 1908. Caruso's relationship with Giachetti, nor their two sons are depicted or ever mentioned in the film. * In the film, Caruso appears to die onstage after a throat hemorrhage during a Metropolitan Opera performance of Martha. Caruso did suffer a throat or mouth hemorrhage during a Met performance of L'elisir d'amore at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on December 11, 1920, causing the performance to be cancelled. On December 24, 1920 he sang the final performance of his career in La Juive at the Met. He died on August 2, 1921 in Naples, possibly of peritonitis, following many months of illness and several surgical procedures. Reception=Box Office= The Great Caruso was a massive commercial success and the most profitable film for MGM in 1951. According to MGM records, it made $4,309,000 in the US and Canada and $4,960,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $3,977,000. The movie was also the most popular at the British box office the same year. =Critics= Newsweek wrote that, \\"Lanza brings to the role not only a fine, natural and remarkably powerful voice, but a physique and personal mannerisms reminiscent of the immortal Caruso.\\" According to Bosley Crowther, the film is \\"perhaps the most elaborate 'pops' concert ever played upon the screen\\"; Blyth's voice is \\"reedy\\" but \\"Lanza has an excellent young tenor voice and...uses it in his many numbers with impressive dramatic power. Likewise, Miss Kirsten and Miss Thebom are ladies who can rock the welkin, too, and their contributions to the concert maintain it at a musical high.\\" Crowther says \\"All of the silliest, sappiest clichés of musical biography have been written by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig into the script. And Richard Thorpe has directed in a comparably mawkish, bathetic style.\\" Nearly 40 years after its release, Caruso's son, Enrico Jr. reminisced that, \\"Vocally and musically The Great Caruso ...has helped many young people discover opera and even become singers themselves.\\"He added that, \\"I can think of no other tenor, before or since Mario Lanza, who could have risen with comparable success to the challenge of playing Caruso in a screen biography.\\" The film has also been cited by tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras as having been an inspiration for them when they were growing up and aspiring to become singers. Awards and honors The film was nominated for three Academy Awards; at the 24th Academy Awards ceremony, Douglas Shearer and the MGM Studio Sound Department won for Best Sound. The film was also Oscar-nominated for its costume design and its score. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated Soundtrack The Great Caruso record album (though not an actual film soundtrack) was issued by RCA Victor on the LP, 45 and 78 RPM formats. The album featured eight popular opera arias (only four of which were heard in the film) sung by Lanza, accompanied by Constantine Callinicos conducting the RCA Victor Orchestra. The album sold 100,000 copies before the film premiered and later became the first operatic LP to sell one million copies. The album remained continuously available after its original 1951 release, and was reissued on compact disc by RCA Victor in 1989. Trivia In 1947, radio actor Elliott Lewis was considered the front- runner for the role of Caruso, and was screen-tested in January and June.https://www.newspapers.com/image/128572743/?terms=%22elliott%2Blewis%22 References ;Bibliography * Caruso, Enrico Jr. and Farkas, Andrew.

The term bed load or bedload describes particles in a flowing fluid (usually water) that are transported along the bed. Bed load is complementary to suspended load and wash load. Bed load moves by rolling, sliding, and/or saltating (hopping). Generally, bed load downstream will be smaller and more rounded than bed load upstream (a process known as downstream fining). This is due in part to attrition and abrasion which results from the stones colliding with each other and against the river channel, thus removing the rough texture (rounding) and reducing the size of the particles. However, selective transport of sediments also plays a role in relation to downstream fining: smaller-than average particles are more easily entrained than larger-than average particles, since the shear stress required to entrain a grain is linearly proportional to the diameter of the grain. However, the degree of size selectivity is restricted by the hiding effect described by Parker and Klingeman (1982), wherein larger particles protrude from the bed whereas small particles are shielded and hidden by larger particles, with the result that nearly all grain sizes become entrained at nearly the same shear stress. Experimental observations suggest that a uniform free-surface flow over a cohesion-less plane bed is unable to entrain sediments below a critical value \\\\tau_{*c} of the ratio between measures of hydrodynamic(destabilizing) and gravitational(stabilizing) forces acting on sediment particles, the so-called Shields stress \\\\tau_*. This quantity reads as: :\\\\tau_*=\\\\frac{u^2_*}{(s-1)gd}, where u_{*} is the friction velocity, s is the relative particle density, d is an effective particle diameter which is entrained by the flow, and g is gravity. Meyer-Peter-Müller formula for the bed load capacity under equilibrium and uniform flow conditions states that the magnitude of the bed load flux q_s for unit width is proportional to the excess of shear stress with respect to a critical one \\\\tau_{*c} . Specifically, q_s is a monotonically increasing nonlinear function of the excess Shields stress \\\\phi(\\\\tau_{*} -\\\\tau_{*c} ), typically expressed in the form of a power law. .

Fortier, (born January 10, 1962) is a Canadian financier, lawyer and former politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Minister of Public Works and Government Services from 2006 to 2008, and Minister of International Trade in 2008 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Fortier served in Cabinet of Canada while a Senator, which proved controversial. In 2008, he resigned from the Senate to run for a seat in the House of Commons in the 2008 election;Fortier resigns from Senate to run for Tories; www.cbc.ca, September 8, 2008. he placed second in riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges.www.conservative.ca. As a former member of the Canadian Cabinet, he is a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and thus has the right to the style The Honourable and the post-nominal designation PC for life. He is the brother of former Quebec Liberal Party MNA Margaret Delisle. Business career Before entering the Cabinet, Fortier was a partner at Ogilvy Renault, a leading Montreal law firm. One of his colleagues was Brian Mulroney. He specialized in securities, mergers and acquisitions. From 1992 to 1996, he managed Ogilvy Renault’s office in London, England. In 1999, he became the Managing Director and Senior Advisor (Eastern Canada) at Crédit Suisse First Boston. In 2004, Fortier became Corporate Financing Director (Quebec) for TD Securities. Two days after his appointment to Cabinet Montreal Gazette columnist Ian McDonald claimed that Fortier \\"was easily making $1 million a year running the Montreal office of TD Securities.\\" Fortier is currently Vice Chairman of RBC Capital Markets. Political career=Early career= Fortier ran in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election but came in last with 4% of the vote. Fortier was a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Montreal-area riding of Laval West during the 2000 federal election placing fourth. In 2003, he was co-chair of Harper's campaign to lead the new Conservative Party. Fortier and veteran MP John Reynolds were the co- chairs of the Conservative campaign in the 2006 election. =Cabinet minister= Fortier was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Public Works on 6 February 2006, the day Stephen Harper's minority government took office. In a cabinet reshuffle in June 2008, he shifted to the International Trade portfolio. A financier and lawyer from Montreal, he had not been elected as a member of the House of Commons at the time he was appointed, nor was he a member of the Senate. Harper announced that Fortier would be appointed to the Senate, but would be expected to step down and run for a seat in the House of Commons at the next election.Cabinet includes defector and senator-to-be, CBC News, February 6, 2006 On February 27, 2006, Fortier was formally summoned to the Senate. This practice is unusual in modern Canada, but there is precedent for such a practice: in 1979, former Prime Minister Joe Clark appointed Quebec Senator Jacques Flynn Minister of Justice because of his lack of representation in that province. In 1972, when Trudeau failed to win a single seat west of Manitoba, he appointed senators to cabinet as well. 19th century Prime Ministers John Abbott and Mackenzie Bowell served their entire terms in government as Senators. Harper intended for Fortier to represent Montreal in Cabinet. No Montreal-area riding has elected a Conservative or any member of the party's predecessors—the Progressive Conservatives, the Canadian Alliance and the Reform Party—since 1988. Since then, right-of-centre candidates have rarely even competed in Montreal except in landslides. =Controversy over Senate appointment= Fortier's appointment to Cabinet drew considerable controversy. The main charge was that Fortier's appointment was a significant departure from past Conservative policy. The Conservatives, and before them Reform and the Alliance, had strongly opposed Senate appointments and unelected Cabinet ministers while in opposition. Opponents of Fortier's appointment also note that in doing so, Harper broke a promise made on Radio- Canada television during the election campaign. As a Senator, Fortier did not attend Question Period to respond to questions from the opposition parties in the House. His Parliamentary Secretaries, James Moore at Public Works and Gerald Keddy at International Trade, answered questions on his behalf. Fortier was subject to questioning in the Senate, but the Bloc Québécois and New Democratic Party were not represented in that body (One senator, Lillian Dyck, was appointed as an NDP Senator, but the NDP opposes the existence of the Senate and does not recognize her as part of its caucus.). The Department of Public Works was at the centre of the sponsorship scandal and spends billions of dollars per year, and the Conservatives singled the department out for criticism as an example of what they saw as a lack of accountability. Fortier himself claimed he didn't run for a seat because \\"I didn't want to run in the election. I had a great career, five young kids, and so it wasn't the right situation for me to run when the election came around. That's just the simple truth.\\" In his blog, Andrew Coyne commented that \\"it is a fine thing for a Prime Minister elected on a platform of democratic accountability, who promised he would not appoint anyone who was not elected, either to cabinet or to the Senate, to then turn around and do both at one go.\\" Jeffrey Simpson of The Globe and Mail wrote that \\"with breathtaking insouciance, Prime Minister Stephen Harper jettisoned, or at least delayed, his promise to only elect senators\\". However, the Toronto Star's Chantal Hébert defended the appointments of Fortier and Emerson to Cabinet, arguing that the problem is with the first-past-the-post system which allows entire parts of the country (such as large cities) to be unrepresented in government. For example, the Conservatives were unable to win any seats in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver in the last election, while the Liberals have only won four seats in Edmonton since 1968 and have only elected three MPs from Calgary since Alberta joined Confederation in 1905. Others have argued that a party's inability to win seats in any particular region is that party's own fault. Michael Fortier was loudly booed at the opening ceremonies of the 2006 World Outgames, an LGBT sporting event and cultural festival held in Montreal. The Conservative senator's speech was interrupted as he attempted to welcome the estimated crowd of 40,000 at the Olympic Stadium that evening. Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay, who was greeted with sustained applause, intervened (unsuccessfully) to urge the crowd to listen \\"with respect\\" to the representative of the Canadian government. =Promise to seek election= On November 21, 2006, Fortier announced that he would seek election to the House of Commons in the riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges in the next federal election, which he lost. The opposition parties pressured him to run in the by-election on November 27 in Repentigny. However, Fortier repeated his original promise to run in the next general election. =Fortier dismisses advisor connected to Julie Couillard= Fortier confirmed June 11, 2008 that he dismissed senior Quebec adviser Bernard Cote after learning that Cote briefly dated Julie Couillard last year while she was attempting to win a government contract. Cote had to resign because of a perceived conflict of interest, since Public Works was handling the building contracts Couillard was bidding on, Fortier said. Fortier told reporters that Cote, \\"should have actually recused himself from this matter, which he didn't do, hence his resignation.\\" Couillard sparked the resignation of foreign minister Maxime Bernier in May 2008 when she went public with the fact her former paramour had forgotten classified NATO briefing documents at her Montreal home for more than a month. =2008 federal election= While he chose not to run in an earlier by-election, Fortier was a candidate for the riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges in the 2008 federal election, in fulfillment of his promise made at the time of his 2006 Senate appointment.Profile of Michael Fortier as Conservative Candidate for Vaudreuil-Soulanges; www.conservative.ca In order to fulfill this promise, on September 8, 2008, he resigned from the Senate to run in the general election. On election night, he was soundly defeated by popular Bloc Québécois incumbent Meili Faille, who captured 41.34% of the vote compared to Fortier's 23.69%.

The character is best known through many adaptations of the story as a vampire hunter and the archenemy of Count Dracula. Dracula In the novel, Professor Van Helsing is called in by his former student, John Seward, to assist with the mysterious illness of Lucy Westenra. Van Helsing's friendship with Seward is based in part upon an unknown prior event in which Van Helsing suffered a grievous wound, and Seward saved his life by sucking out the gangrene. It is Van Helsing who first realizes that Lucy is the victim of a vampire, and he guides Seward and his friends in their efforts to save Lucy. According to Leonard Wolf's annotations to the novel, Van Helsing had a son who died. Van Helsing says that his son, had he lived, would have had a similar appearance to Lucy's suitor Arthur Holmwood. Consequently, Van Helsing developed a particular fondness for Holmwood. Van Helsing's wife went insane from grief after their son's death, but as a Catholic, he refuses to divorce her (\\"with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though no wits, all gone, even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife\\"). Van Helsing is one of the few characters in the novel who is fully physically described in one place. In chapter 14, Mina Harker describes him as: Van Helsing's personality is described by John Seward, his former student, thus: In the novel, Van Helsing is described as having what is apparently a thick foreign accent, in that he speaks in broken English and he uses German phrases such as \\"Mein Gott\\" (). Adaptations of the novel have tended to play up Van Helsing's role as a vampire expert, sometimes to the extent that it is depicted as his major occupation. In the novel, however, Dr. Seward requests Van Helsing's assistance simply because Lucy's affliction has him baffled and Van Helsing \\"knows as much about obscure diseases as anyone in the world\\". =Narrative= Count Dracula, having acquired ownership of the Carfax estate near London through solicitor Jonathan Harker, moves to the estate and begins menacing England. His victims include Lucy Westenra, who is on holiday in Whitby. The aristocratic girl has suitors such as John Seward, Arthur Holmwood, and Quincey Morris, and has a best friend in Mina Murray, Harker's fiancée. Seward, who works as a doctor in an insane asylum – where one of the patients, the incurably mad Renfield, has a psychic connection to Dracula – contacts Professor Van Helsing about Lucy's peculiar condition. Van Helsing, recognizing marks upon her neck, eventually deduces that she has been losing blood from a vampire bite. He administers multiple blood transfusions. Van Helsing, Seward, and Arthur each donate blood to her, but each night she continues to lose blood. He prescribes her garlic, makes a necklace of garlic flowers for her, and hangs garlic about her room. He also gives her a crucifix to wear around her neck. Lucy's demise was brought by her mother, who cleared the room of garlic and opened the window for fresh air; a servant had stolen the gold crucifix. Lucy dies and after the funeral returns as a vampire, seeking out children. Eventually, Van Helsing, Arthur, Morris and Seward free the undead Lucy from her vampiric curse: Arthur uses a hammer to drive the stake through her heart and Van Helsing cuts off her head and puts garlic in her mouth. Mina, now married to Harker, becomes increasingly worried about his brain fever. Van Helsing reviews his journal and Harker's health returns when he learns that his experiences in Transylvania were real. Mina discovers that various letters and accounts provide further intelligence on Dracula's movements, and shares these with Harker, Seward, Morris, and Van Helsing. They learn that Dracula's residence in Carfax is near Seward's, and Van Helsing's research reveals Dracula's weaknesses and strengths. Seward and Van Helsing also write to a university acquaintance to aid in further research. Staying at Seward's residence to better plan strategies in their efforts to deal with Dracula, they have frequent meetings and each member is assigned duties. At a later meeting a bat is seen at a window. To destroy Dracula and prevent further spread of evil, the party enters his estate at Carfax and as a group encounters him for the first time. They discover that he has been purchasing properties in and around London, with plans to distribute 50 boxes of Transylvanian earth to them, used as graves so each property would become a safe lair. They visit these lairs and place sacramental bread in the boxes of the earth to \\"sterilize\\" them, preventing Dracula from further using them. Dracula entices Renfield to invite him into Seward's residence. Renfield is found critically injured by Seward and Van Helsing who operate on him, and Renfield informs them that Dracula went to see Mina. They go to Mina's room and find Harker hypnotized while Dracula is giving Mina the 'Vampire's Baptism of Blood', cursing her and the group for plotting against him. The party uses sacred items to repel Dracula, who flees into a different room as a vapor. Dracula then destroys all the texts Mina had produced, except for one which was hidden, and breaks Renfield's neck before leaving. Van Helsing places a wafer of sacramental bread upon Mina's forehead to bless her but it burns her flesh, leaving a scar. Mina, feeling that she is now connected with Dracula, asks Van Helsing to hypnotize her before dawn, the only time she feels she could freely speak. Through this hypnosis they learn that Mina has a telepathic link with Dracula, that she could tell everything he hears and feels, which could be used to track his movements. Mina agrees that any plans should be kept from her for fear that Dracula could read her thoughts. The group has additional encounters with Dracula as they continue to search for his residences throughout London and sterilize the boxes. Learning that his final grave is aboard a boat, Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is fleeing back to his castle. When the party pursues Dracula to Transylvania, they split into groups. While Mina and Van Helsing travel straight to Dracula's castle, the others attempt to ambush the boat on which Dracula is a passenger. Van Helsing's influence over Mina diminishes each day, and her behavior changes as she sleeps more during the day, loses her appetite for food, and ceases to write in her journal. He finds that she cannot cross a circle of crumbled sacramental bread. Later, Dracula's vampiric wives approach their camp but they too are unable to cross into the circle of bread. Failing at their attempts to lure Van Helsing and Mina out of the circle, they flee back to Dracula's castle just before sunrise. Van Helsing binds Mina at a cave to keep her from danger as he goes into Dracula's castle to kill the vampires. As Van Helsing runs through the castle searching its rooms, he finds Dracula's empty tomb and the three female vampires he saw earlier. He begins to do his operation on the first vampire but finds himself entranced by her beauty and unable to bring himself to harm her. In his feelings of enchantment, he even contemplates love for her. He is broken out of this enchantment when he hears a \\"soul wail\\" from Mina, awakening him. He proceeds to drive stakes into their hearts and sever their heads, one by one. Van Helsing returns to Mina and they see the rest of their party as they chase a group of gypsies down the Borgo Pass and corner them. Armed with knives and firearms they overtake the gypsies and open the final box of Dracula; Jonathan Harker brings his Kukri knife down on Dracula's throat as the bowie knife of Quincey Morris simultaneously impales Dracula's heart in the final moments of daylight. At this moment Dracula's body crumbles to dust. After the struggle, Quincey is seen to have been fatally wounded. Six years later, Van Helsing takes a grandfatherly role in regard to the young Quincey Harker, Jonathan and Mina's son. Equipment Van Helsing is seen utilising many tools to aid him and his party in fending off Dracula, warding off vampires and in general defeating the undead: * Skeleton keys used for lock picking to open the doors to many of Dracula's lairs located throughout London. * Wreath of withered garlic blossoms * Silver crucifix * Sacred wafer brought from Amsterdam contained in an envelope or crushed and sprinkled around him in a circle as a protective barrier. * Electric lamps which could be attached or secured against the chest. * Revolver and knife for use against enemies weaker than Dracula. * The branch of a wild rose could be placed on top of a coffin containing a vampire; immobilising it. * Mountain ash used to repel the undead. * Wooden stake and hammer to pierce a vampire's heart. * Golden crucifix necklace, given to Lucy.  On screen = Film adaptations of the novel = *Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror (1922) was the first film version of Dracula. Although it followed the same basic plot as the novel, names were changed: Van Helsing is 'Professor Bulwer' (John Gottowt) and appears only in a few scenes. Unlike the book, he is a friend of 'Thomas Hutter' (the film's version of Jonathan Harker) before he meets 'Count Orlok' (a renamed Count Dracula), and he never meets the vampire face to face. *In the initial 1931 Universal version of Dracula starring Bela Lugosi as the Count, Professor Van Helsing was portrayed by the actor Edward Van Sloan, who had previously played the part opposite Lugosi on stage. Van Sloan was the only cast member to reprise his role in the sequel Dracula's Daughter (1936). *Eduardo Arozamena portrayed Van Helsing in Universal’s simultaneously shot Spanish version Drácula (1931). *Peter Cushing's Doctor Van Helsing in the initial 1958 Hammer Dracula movie and its 1960 sequel The Brides of Dracula differed from the novel's in that the actor portrayed the character as a visibly younger man (as did Christopher Lee as the Count), and also one whose main vocation appears to be vampire hunting. His first name is never mentioned, though in the later Hammer Dracula films set in the 1970s (which apparently exist on a different timeline) Lee's Dracula battles Cushing's 'Lorrimer Van Helsing', a grandson of a previous vampire hunter, who appears as 'Lawrence Van Helsing' (also Cushing) in the prologue to Dracula A.D. 1972. In the final Hammer Dracula production The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (set mainly in 1904) Cushing again plays the original Van Helsing from the Hammer series. *Herbert Lom in Count Dracula (1970). * Walter Ladengast played Van Helsing in Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), a remake of the 1922 film. *John Badham's 1979 version of Dracula saw Laurence Olivier portray Van Helsing as a frail old man whose daughter becomes one of the undead, drawing him into a conflict with Frank Langella's Count that eventually costs the Professor his life. *Anthony Hopkins portrayed Professor Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1992. This Van Helsing often comes across as somewhat eccentric and unbalanced, casually discussing how to kill the un-dead despite the brutal methods involved, and displaying ruthlessness when dispatching Dracula's brides, but he nevertheless leads a group of friends to victory over the Count. *In the 1995 spoof film Dracula: Dead and Loving It, the movie's director Mel Brooks plays Professor Van Helsing. *David Moroni in Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary (2002). * Rutger Hauer in Dracula 3D (2012). =TV adaptations of the novel= * Bernard Archard in Dracula (1968) * Ota Sklenčka in Hrabe Drakula (1971) * Nigel Davenport in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1973) * Frank Finlay in the BBC adaptation Count Dracula (1977) * Giancarlo Giannini (as Enrico Valenzi) in Dracula (2002) * David Suchet in Dracula (2006) * Thomas Kretschmann in Dracula (2013) * Dolly Wells (as Sister Agatha Van Helsing / Zoe Van Helsing) in Dracula (2020) = Other screen appearances of the character=Films * Jack Gwillim in The Monster Squad (1987) * Peter Fonda in Nadja (1994) * Christopher Plummer in Dracula 2000 (2000). After defeating Count Dracula (Gerard Butler), Van Helsing finds that the vampire lord cannot die by the conventional means of destroying a vampire and he only succeeded in paralysing him in a deathlike state. When Dracula escapes after his coffin is stolen, Van Helsing's daughter and his assistant are able to defeat him after the elder Van Helsing's death. *Hugh Jackman played Gabriel Van Helsing, in Van Helsing (2004), loosely based on Stoker's character. Having been found on the steps of a church several years before with total amnesia, Gabriel hunts monsters for a secret organisation made up of the world's religions (known as the Knights of the Holy Order) to rid the world of evil \\"that the rest of mankind has no idea exists\\", although he is the most wanted man in Europe for his conspicuous actions. In the movie he is sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula. When he arrives, Dracula tells Gabriel that they have already met and have quite a history together, with Dracula revealing over the course of the film that Van Helsing was the one who originally murdered him, as well as claiming ownership of a distinctive ring that Van Helsing has worn as long as he can remember. It is implied that Gabriel is actually the angel Gabriel, with vague references to Dracula's murderer as the \\"Left Hand of God\\". Jackman also voiced the character in the animated spin-off Van Helsing: The London Assignment (2004). * David Carradine in The Last Sect (2006). * Wallace Shawn in Vamps (2012). TV * David Warner in Penny Dreadful (2014). Van Helsing here is a hematologist consulted by Victor Frankenstein. He eventually admits he has known about vampires for some time and offers to give Frankenstein some much-needed instruction in the area. * Michael Eklund in Van Helsing (2019), original patriarch of the Van Helsing family who managed to previously trap the Dark One and meets with his descendant Vanessa Van Helsing. Appearances in other media=On stage= * In 1924 play Dracula by Hamilton Deane Van Helsing is portrayed as the main nemesis of Dracula. Deane himself played the role in British productions of the play. In 1927 the play was brought to Broadway by producer Horace Liveright, who hired John L. Balderston to revise the script for American audiences. The role of Van Helsing on Broadway was played by Edward Van Sloan. It's due to this play and its adaptation into 1931 film, that the notion of Van Helsing as Dracula's archenemy was introduced into popular culture (in the novel the two never had any conversations and Dracula never singled out Van Helsing out of the group of people, who were after him). * Van Helsing was played by Stephen Henderson in 2004 Broadway production of Dracula, the Musical by Frank Wildhorn. * Van Helsing was played by Pierre Flynn in 2006 French Canadian musical Dracula – Entre l'amour et la mort. * Van Helsing was played by Aymeric Ribot in 2011 French musical Dracula, l'amour plus fort que la mort. * Van Helsing was portrayed by Ashley Dixon in 2019 Northern Ballet's production of Dracula by David Nixon. The production was recorded and showed in UK cinemas on Halloween and then broadcast on BBC4 in 2020.https://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/mck25q/dracula-by-northern-balletdracula-by-northern-ballet/ =Novels= * The Robert Statzer novel To Love a Vampire () chronicles Van Helsing's days as a medical student, depicting his first confrontation with the occult during an encounter with Countess Elizabeth Báthory and her niece, Carmilla Karnstein. Originally published as a serial in the pages of Scary Monsters Magazine from March 2011 to June 2013, a revised version of To Love a Vampire was reprinted in paperback and Kindle editions in June 2018. *In the 2009 Dacre Stoker novel Dracula the Un-dead, Van Helsing is now a 75-year-old man with heart problems, having apparently been disgraced in the medical profession for deaths caused by improper blood transfusions (although he defends his reputation by arguing that nobody knew about blood types until much later); he was also briefly a suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders due to his knowledge of anatomy and reputation for mutilating corpses for unspecified reasons. He later becomes a vampire himself after a meeting with Dracula revealed that Dracula was actually hunting the true monster of Elizabeth Báthory, but Van Helsing is killed in a confrontation with Arthur Holmwood, as he cannot accept the revelation that they were hunting the wrong threat. Holmwood throws himself at Van Helsing, causing the pair to fall to their deaths. *P. N. Elrod's novel Quincey Morris, Vampire takes up the story almost immediately after the conclusion of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but in this story (which shows vampires in a more sympathetic light) Van Helsing is unyielding and unwavering in his beliefs and his hatred of vampires to the point where he eventually alienates his former friends and allies. * In Edward M. Erdelac's 2012 epistolary novel, Terovolas, Van Helsing suffers a bout of madness stemming from his encounter with Dracula's brides, and commits himself to Seward's care. Upon release, he voluntarily bears the personal effects of Quincey Morris back to the Morris family ranch in Texas, only to be embroiled in more supernatural doings related to a group of enigmatic Norwegian ranchers. *The comic novel Dracula's Diary by Michael Geare and Michael Corby () completely re-tells the Stoker novel, with the young Count Dracula (who has been learning to act like a true British gentleman) becoming a secret agent for Her Majesty's government and Van Helsing an enemy agent for a foreign power who is continually thwarted by Dracula. *In The Dracula Tapes (1975) by Fred Saberhagen, a psychotic, fanatical, bumbling Van Helsing opposes the urbane, if ruthless, Dracula. *In Fangland by John Marks, the re-imagined Van Helsing is split into two separate characters, namely Clementine Spence and Austen Trotta. *He also appears in the Department 19 series by Will Hill. * In the 2017 novel A Betrayal in Blood by Mark A. Lathan, Mycroft Holmes asks his brother Sherlock to investigate Van Helsing's 'Crew of Light' after they have been cleared of murder charges due to Dracula's vampiric nature. In the course of the investigation, Holmes and Dr. Watson realize that Van Helsing is actually a 'retired' German spy who manipulated Seward and the Harkers - Seward through his loyalty and the Harkers through blackmail of their role in the death of Jonathan's former employer - and arranged for the death of Quincey Morris in order to kill Dracula, in reality a reclusive man whose only crime was a long-ago affair with Van Helsing's wife, this affair producing a son who was given up for adoption to become Arthur Holmwood. At the conclusion of the case, Van Helsing commits suicide by shooting himself in a train bathroom while Holmes and Watson are taking him back to England to stand trial after a final confrontation in Translyvania. =Radio and Audio= * In radio drama Dracula by The Mercury Theatre on the Air, which was broadcast in 1938, Van Helsing was played by Martin Gabel. Dracula was played by Orsen Welles. *In the Big Finish Productions audio drama The Tangled Skein (adapted from the novella by David Stuart Davies) Van Helsing, acting alone, joins forces with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to investigate the presence of vampires in London. Although initially disbelieving of Van Helsing's convictions when they read about his lectures on vampires, the duo accept his word when they are confronted and nearly killed by a vampire in Hampstead Heath, joining Van Helsing in staking the vampire. While Van Helsing is forced to focus on his lectures over the next few days, he leaves his vampire-hunting equipment with Holmes and Watson, who track Dracula to Dartmoor, where he has hidden in Baskerville Hall, and are able to defeat him using Van Helsing's advice. After Dracula is defeated when trapped in the Grimpen Mire as the sun rises, Holmes gives Van Helsing Dracula's ring as a memento of their victory, concluding that Van Helsing's research is what enabled him to destroy Dracula. =Comics= Dracula and Rachel Van Helsing: The Tomb of Dracula No. 40 (Jan. 1976). Art by Gene Colan and Tom Palmer. Abraham Van Helsing was also portrayed in The Tomb of Dracula Marvel Comics series, which was based on the characters of Bram Stoker's novel. In the Marvel Comics miniseries X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula, Van Helsing joins forces with the immortal mutant Apocalypse and his worshipers, Clan Akkaba, in order to destroy Dracula, their common enemy. It is noted that Van Helsing had encountered Apocalypse before and previously believed him to be a vampire. In the Italian comic book Martin Mystère and the spin-off series Storie di Altrove/Stories from Elsewhere Van Helsing's name is Richard. He was originally a knight in the service of the Holy Roman Emperors but he was captured in 1475 by the undead warriors of the Order of the Dragon and turned into a vampire by the Wallachian Prince Vlad Dracula. Four centuries later, Van Helsing killed Dracula, and later came to London to solve the case of Jack the Ripper, eventually discovering that the murderers were mentally controlled by demons from another world. In 1902 he worked together with the resurrected Dracula to prevent the assassination of King Edward VII. Media involving Van Helsing's descendants There have been numerous works of fiction depicting descendants of Van Helsing carrying on the family tradition. =Films= *Several of Hammer’s Dracula films feature other members of the Van Helsing family alongside Peter Cushing as the Doctor; The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974), set in the early 1900s, features his son ‘Leyland’, played by Robin Stewart. Meanwhile, the latter-day Van Helsing has a daughter named 'Jessica' in both Dracula A.D. 1972, played by Stephanie Beacham, and The Satanic Rites of Dracula, played by Joanna Lumley. *The 1979 film Love at First Bite, is a comedic parody in which Dracula falls in love, and Jeffrey Rosenberg, grandson of Fritz Van Helsing, tries to kill him. *In the 1989 film Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat, Bruce Campbell plays Robert Van Helsing, grandson of an earlier Van Helsing. * In the 2000 film Dracula 2000 Justine Waddell plays Van Helsing’s daughter Mary. * In the 2000 Disney channel movie Mom's Got a Date with a Vampire, Malachi Van Helsing is hunting the vampire Dimitri, who is preying on the mother of the main characters. * The 2004 direct-to-video film Dracula 3000 features Captain Abraham Van Helsing (played by Casper Van Dien), a descendant of the original Van Helsing and the captain of a spacefaring salvage ship. * The 2004 direct-to-video film The Adventures of Young Van Helsing depicts Abraham Van Helsing's great-grandson Michael (Keith Jordan) saving the world from Simon Magus. * The 2006 film Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse features a character named Jacob Van Helsing (Rhett Giles), who is implied to be a descendant of the original. * The 2009 film Stan Helsing is a comedic film revolving around satirizing the Van Helsing descendant of the 2004 feature film. * In the 2012 TV film, Scooby-Doo!

A mad scientist and vampire hunter, Von Goosewing is a parody of Van Helsing. He is a goose that speaks in a German accent, and wears an outfit not unlike that of Sherlock Holmes. He pursues Count Duckula relentlessly, never able to comprehend that Duckula is actually completely harmless. He is a terrible scientist, often getting injured by his own crackpot inventions, and he is supremely unobservant, often bumping into Duckula and conversing with him for several minutes without realising to whom he is speaking. *The 1990 series Dracula: The Series had Bernard Behrens as Gustav Helsing. He was looking after his two nephews, Christopher Townsend and Max Townsend. They fought Dracula, who in the contemporary world, had taken on the name of Alexander Lucard.

Eric lives in a travel trailer with his son Jonathan. There are also references made to previous Van Helsing vampire slayers. *The 2006 series Tom and Jerry Tales episode Monster Con, Van Helsing appears with Tom and uses some of his equipment to catch Jerry, but catches a few ghosts instead and turns into a werewolf cat when he is bitten by Jerry's friend, the werewolf. *The 2009 ITV series Demons follows Abraham's great grandson Luke Rutherford (Christian Cooke). *Syfy is airing a Van Helsing episodic television series with Neil LaBute as creator. The lead character is Vanessa Van Helsing (Kelly Overton), said to be great great great granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing. Abraham Van Helsing appears in the fourth season and other characters related to him have appeared as well. *In the 2019 FX series What We Do in the Shadows, Guillermo, the devoted human familiar of Nandor the Relentless in Staten Island, who has accidentally killed two vampires, finds out through a DNA test that one of his ancestors was named Van Helsing. Horrified, he says \\"Van Helsing isn't real\\" but then reasons \\"Vampires are real.\\" In season 2, he struggles with his ancestry which has made him an extremely adept vampire slayer, killing dozens in order to protect his master by the end of season 2. =Books and stories= * The short story Abraham's Boys by Joe Hill is about the retired Abraham Van Helsing and his two sons, and how he passes along his knowledge to them. The story is included in the anthology The many faces of Van Helsing. * According to The Vampire Hunter's Handbook, Abraham was not the first Van Helsing to encounter vampires. The book is supposedly written by Raphael Van Helsing in the 18th century. It has also been prequeled by The Demon Hunter's Handbook by Abelard Van Helsing (16th century) and The Dragon Hunter's Handbook by Adelia Vin Helsin (14th century). The supposed writers refer to each other (in the cases where it makes sense) and other Van Helsings. * Similar to the above-mentioned handbooks is Vampyre: The Terrifying Lost Journal which is written by Mary-Jane Knight but credited to Dr. Cornelius Van Helsing. The book implies that Cornelius is the brother of Abraham. * Young Dracula by Michael Lawrence mentions a farmer named Dweeb Van Helsing. * In Den hemliga boken and sequels by Jesper Tillberg and Peter Bergting, the main character is Abraham's great grandson Lennart Van Helsing (not to be confused with Lennart Hellsing). * Van Helsing's Gazette is repeatedly referred to in Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next novels. =Anime and manga= * In the manga and anime, Hellsing, modern day descendant Integra Hellsing leads a British government strike force against supernatural menaces.

Black dots show dead zones of unknown size. The size and number of marine dead zones—areas where the deep water is so low in dissolved oxygen that sea creatures can't survive—have grown explosively in the past half-century. – NASA Earth Observatory (2008)Aquatic Dead Zones NASA Earth Observatory. Revised 17 July 2010. Retrieved 17 January 2010. Dead zones are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world's oceans and large lakes, which causes these bodies of water to fail to support the marine life living there. Historically, many of these sites were naturally occurring. However, in the 1970s, oceanographers began noting increased instances and expanses of dead zones. These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated. Dead zones are bodies of water that do not have sufficient oxygen (3) levels in order to support most marine life. Dead zones are caused by oxygen-depleting factors which include, but are not limited to, human pollution (4). This is a process called eutrophication, where oxygen levels decrease as elements such nitrogen and phosphorus increase. A healthy river will have increased amounts of oxygen for consumption by organisms (1). As nitrogen increases, algae (5) produce large amounts of oxygen, but die from increased nitrogen. Decomposers then use all of the remaining oxygen decomposing the algae, resulting in no oxygen left and no oxygen being produced. (2). In March 2004, when the recently established UN Environment Programme published its first Global Environment Outlook Year Book (GEO Year Book 2003), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where marine life could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre (0.4 mi²), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 mi²). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide. Causes decay of algae during algal blooms, like this one off the coast of La Jolla, San Diego, California. Climate has a significant impact on the growth and decline of ecological dead zones. During spring months, as rainfall increases, more nutrient-rich water flows down the mouth of the Mississippi River. At the same time, as sunlight increases during the spring, algal growth in the dead zones increases dramatically. In fall months, tropical storms begin to enter the Gulf of Mexico and break up the dead zones, and the cycle repeats again in the spring. Aquatic and marine dead zones can be caused by an increase in nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water, known as eutrophication. These chemicals are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. Eutrophication can lead to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these phytoplankton, a phenomenon known as an algal bloom. Limnologist Dr. David Schindler, whose research at the Experimental Lakes Area led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones, > \\"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and > 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which > people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of > what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie > problem. Global expansion of dead zones caused by algal blooms is rising > rapidly.\\" The major groups of algae are Cyanobacteria, green algae, Dinoflagellates, Coccolithophores and Diatom algae. An increase in the input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Other algae are consumed and thus do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of hypoxia. Dead zones can be caused by natural and by anthropogenic factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical fertilizers is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.Corn boom could expand 'dead zone' in Gulf NBC News.msn.com Notable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region, surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years. Additionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as fjords or the Black Sea, have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be stagnant there for a long time. The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed.Pickard, G.L. and Emery, W.J. 1982. Description Physical Oceanography: An Introduction. Pergamon Press, Oxford, page 47. These areas are also known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). In many cases, OMZs are permanent or semipermanent areas. Remains of organisms found within sediment layers near the mouth of the Mississippi River indicate four hypoxic events before the advent of synthetic fertilizer. In these sediment layers, anoxia-tolerant species are the most prevalent remains found. The periods indicated by the sediment record correspond to historic records of high river flow recorded by instruments at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Changes in ocean circulation triggered by ongoing climate change could also add or magnify other causes of oxygen reductions in the ocean. In August 2017, a report suggested that the US meat industry and agroeconomic system are predominantly responsible for the largest-ever dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Soil runoff and leached nitrate, exacerbated by agricultural land management and tillage practices as well as manure and synthetic fertilizer usage, contaminated water from the Heartland to the Gulf of Mexico. A large portion of the crops grown in this region are used as major feed components in the production of meat animals for agribusiness companies, like Tyson and Smithfield Foods.  Types  Dead zones can be classified by type, and are identified by the length of their occurrence: * Permanent dead zones are deep water occurrences that rarely exceed 2 milligrams per liter. * Temporary dead zones are short lived dead zones lasting hours or days. * Seasonal dead zones are annually occurring, typically in warm months of summer and autumn. * Diel cycling hypoxia is a specific seasonal dead zone that only becomes hypoxic during the night Effects Baltic covered with dead or dying crabs, fish and clams killed by oxygen depletion Due to the hypoxic conditions present in dead zones, marine life within these areas tends to be scarce. Most fish and motile organisms tend to emigrate out to the zone as oxygen concentrations fall, and benthic populations may experience severe losses in when oxygen concentrations are below 0.5 mg l−1 O2. In severe anoxic conditions, microbial life may experience dramatic shifts in community identity as well, resulting in an increased abundance of anaerobic organisms as aerobic microbes decrease in number and switch energy sources for oxidation such as nitrate, sulfate, or iron reduction. Sulfur reduction is a particular concern as Hydrogen sulfide is toxic and stresses most organisms within the zone further, exacerbating mortality risks. Low oxygen levels can have severe effects on survivability of organisms inside the area while above lethal anoxic conditions. Studies conducted along the Gulf Coast of North America have shown hypoxic conditions lead to reduction of reproductive rates and growth rates in a variety of organisms including fish and benthic invertebrates. Organisms able to leave the area typically do so when oxygen concentrations decrease to less than 2 mg l−1. At these oxygen concentrations and below, organisms that survive inside the oxygen deficient environment and are unable to escape the area will often exhibit progressively worsening stress behavior and die. Surviving organisms tolerant of hypoxic conditions often exhibit physiological adaptations appropriate for persisting within hypoxic environments. Examples of such adaptations include increased efficiency of oxygen intake and use, lowering required amount of oxygen intake through reduced growth rates or dormancy, and increasing the usage of anaerobic metabolic pathways. Community composition in benthic communities is dramatically disrupted by periodic oxygen depletion events, such as those of Seasonal Dead Zones and occurring as a result of Diel Cycles. The longterm effects of such hypoxic conditions result in a shift in communities, most commonly manifest as a decrease in species diversity through mass mortality events. Reestablishment of benthic communities depend upon composition of adjacent communities for larval recruitment. This results in a shift towards faster establishing colonizers with shorter and more opportunistic life strategies, potentially disrupting historic benthic compositions. The influence of dead zones on fisheries and other marine commercial activities varies by the length of occurrence and location. Dead zones are often accompanied by a decrease in biodiversity and collapse in benthic populations, lowering the diversity of yield in commercial fishing operations, but in cases of eutrophication-related dead zone formations, the increase in nutrient availability can lead to temporary rises in select yields among pelagic populations, such as Anchovies. However, studies estimate that the increased production in the surrounding areas do not offset the net decrease in productivity resulting from the dead zone. For instance, an estimated 17,000 MT of carbon in the form of prey for fisheries has been lost as a result of Dead Zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, many stressors in fisheries are worsened by hypoxic conditions. Indirect factors such as increased success by invasive species and increased pandemic intensity in stressed species such as oysters both lead to losses in revenue and ecological stability in affected regions. Despite most other life forms being killed by the lack of oxygen, jellyfish can thrive and are sometimes present in dead zones in vast numbers. Jellyfish blooms produce large quantities of mucus, leading to major changes in food webs in the ocean since few organisms feed on them. The organic carbon in mucus is metabolized by bacteria which return it to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide in what has been termed a \\"jelly carbon shunt\\". The potential worsening of Jellyfish Blooms as a result of human activities has driven new research into the influence of dead zones on jelly populations. The primary concern is the potential for dead zones to serve as breeding grounds for jelly populations as a result of the hypoxic conditions driving away competition for resources and common predators of jellyfish. The increased population of jellyfish could have high commercial costs with loss of fisheries, destruction and contamination of trawling nets and fishing vessels, and lowered tourism revenue in coastal systems. Locations Dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico In the 1970s, marine dead zones were first noted in settled areas where intensive economic use stimulated scientific scrutiny: in the U.S. East Coast's Chesapeake Bay, in Scandinavia's strait called the Kattegat, which is the mouth of the Baltic Sea and in other important Baltic Sea fishing grounds, in the Black Sea, and in the northern Adriatic. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and New Zealand. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide. =Baltic Sea= Researchers from Baltic Nest Institute published in one of PNAS issues reports that the dead zones in the Baltic Sea have grown from approximately 5,000 km2 to more than 60,000 km2 in recent years. Some of the causes behind the elevated increase of dead zones can be attributed to the use of fertilizers, large animal farms, the burning of fossil fuels, and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants. =Chesapeake Bay= As reported by the National Geographic \\"The Chesapeake Bay, on the East Coast of the United States, has one of the first dead zones ever identified, in the 1970s. The Chesapeake’s high levels of nitrogen are caused by two factors: urbanization and agriculture. The western part of the bay is full of factories and urban centers that emit nitrogen into the air. Atmospheric nitrogen accounts for about a third of the nitrogen that enters the bay. The eastern part of the bay is a center of poultry farming, which produces large amounts of manure.\\" The National Geographic further stated \\"Since 1967, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation has led a number of programs that aim to improve the bay’s water quality and curb pollution runoff. The Chesapeake still has a dead zone, whose size varies with the season and weather.\\" =Elizabeth River, Virginia= The Elizabeth River estuary is important for Norfolk, Virginia, Chesapeake, Virginia, Virginia Beach, Virginia and Portsmouth, Virginia. It has been polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus, but also toxic deposits from the shipbuilding industry, the military, the world's largest coal export facility, refineries, loading docks, container-repair facilities and others, so fish had been \\"offlimits since the 1920s\\". In 1993, a group formed to clean it up, adopting the mummichog as a mascot, and has removed thousands of tons of contaminated sediment. In 2006, a 35-acre biological dead zone called Money Point was dredged out, and this let fish return, and the wetland recover. =Lake Erie= A dead zone exists in the central part of Lake Erie from east of Point Pelee to Long Point and stretches to shores in Canada and the United States. The zone has been noticed since the 1950s to 1960s, but efforts since the 1970s have been made by Canada and the US to reduce runoff pollution into the lake as means to reverse the dead zone growth. Overall the lake's oxygen level is poor with only a small area to the east of Long Point that has better levels. The biggest impact of the poor oxygen levels is to lacustrine life and fisheries industry. =Lower St. Lawrence Estuary= A dead zone exists in the Lower St. Lawrence River area from east the Saguenay River to east of Baie Comeau, greatest at depths over and noticed since the 1930s. The main concerns for Canadian scientists is the impact of fish found in the area. =Oregon= Off the coast of Cape Perpetua, Oregon, there is also a dead zone with a 2006 reported size of 300 square miles (780 km²). This dead zone only exists during the summer, perhaps due to wind patterns. The Oregon coast has also seen hypoxic water transporting itself from the continental shelf to the coastal embayments. This has seemed to cause intensity in several areas of Oregon's climate such as upwelled water containing oxygen concentration and upwelled winds. =Gulf of Mexico 'dead zone'= The area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States. The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, \\"seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin\\". which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year. Even though Iowa occupies less than 5% of the Mississippi River drainage basin, average annual nitrate discharge from surface water in Iowa is about 204,000 to 222,000 metric tonnes, or 25% of all the nitrate which the Mississippi River delivers to the Gulf of Mexico. Export from the Raccoon River Watershed is among the highest in the United States with annual yields at 26.1 kg/ha/year which ranked as the highest loss of nitrate out of 42 Mississippi subwatersheds evaluated for a Gulf of Mexico hypoxia report. In 2012, Iowa introduced the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which \\"is a science and technology-based framework to assess and reduce nutrients to Iowa waters and the Gulf of Mexico. It is designed to direct efforts to reduce nutrients in surface water from both point and nonpoint sources in a scientific, reasonable and cost effective manner.\\" The strategy continues to evolve, using voluntary methods to reduce Iowa's negative contributions through outreach, research, and implementation of nutrient holding practices. In order to help reduce agricultural runoff into the Mississippi Basin, Minnesota passed MN Statute 103F.48 in 2015, also known as the \\"Buffer Law\\", which was designed to implement mandatory riparian buffers between farmland and public waterways across the State of Minnesota. The Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) issued a January 2019 report stating that compliance with the 'Buffer Law' has reached 99%. Size  The area of hypoxic bottom water that occurs for several weeks each summer in the Gulf of Mexico has been mapped most years from 1985 through 2017. The size varies annually from a record high in 2017 when it encompassed more than 22,730 sq kilometers (8,776 square miles) to a record low in 1988 of 39 sq kilometers (15 square miles). The 2015 dead zone measured 16,760 square kilometers (6,474 square miles).2015 Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic Zone Size, Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force, EPA, n.d. Nancy Rabalais of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium in Cocodrie, Louisiana predicted the dead zone or hypoxic zone in 2012 will cover an area of 17,353 sq kilometers (6,700 square miles) which is larger than Connecticut; however, when the measurements were completed, the area of hypoxic bottom water in 2012 only totaled 7,480 sq kilometers. The models using the nitrogen flux from the Mississippi River to predict the \\"dead zone\\" areas have been criticized for being systematically high from 2006 to 2014, having predicted record areas in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2013 that were never realized. In late summer 1988 the dead zone disappeared as the great drought caused the flow of Mississippi to fall to its lowest level since 1933. During times of heavy flooding in the Mississippi River Basin, as in 1993, \\"\\"the \\"dead zone\\" dramatically increased in size, approximately larger than the previous year\\". Economic impact Some assert that the dead zone threatens lucrative commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. \\"In 2009, the dockside value of commercial fisheries in the Gulf was $629 million. Nearly three million recreational fishers further contributed about $10 billion to the Gulf economy, taking 22 million fishing trips.\\" Scientists are not in universal agreement that nutrient loading has a negative impact on fisheries. Grimes makes a case that nutrient loading enhances the fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Courtney et al. hypothesize, that nutrient loading may have contributed to the increases in red snapper in the northern and western Gulf of Mexico. History Shrimp trawlers first reported a 'dead zone' in the Gulf of Mexico in 1950, but it was not until 1970 when the size of the hypoxic zone had increased that scientists began to investigate. After 1950, the conversion of forests and wetlands for agricultural and urban developments accelerated. \\"Missouri River Basin has had hundreds of thousands of acres of forests and wetlands (66,000,000 acres) replaced with agriculture activity [. . .] In the Lower Mississippi one-third of the valley's forests were converted to agriculture between 1950 and 1976.\\" In July 2007, a dead zone was discovered off the coast of Texas where the Brazos River empties into the Gulf. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 calls for the production of of renewable fuels by 2022, including of corn-based ethanol, a tripling of current production that would require a similar increase in corn production. Unfortunately, the plan poses a new problem; the increase in demand for corn production results in a proportional increase in nitrogen runoff. Although nitrogen, which makes up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, is an inert gas, it has more reactive forms, two of which (nitrate and ammonia) are used to make fertilizer. According to , a professor of crop physiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, corn requires more nitrogen-based fertilizer because it produces a higher grain per unit area than other crops and, unlike other crops, corn is completely dependent on available nitrogen in soil. The results, reported 18 March 2008 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that scaling up corn production to meet the goal would increase nitrogen loading in the Dead Zone by 10–18%. This would boost nitrogen levels to twice the level recommended by the Mississippi Basin/Gulf of Mexico Water Nutrient Task Force (Mississippi River Watershed Conservation Programs), a coalition of federal, state, and tribal agencies that have monitored the dead zone since 1997. The task force says a 30% reduction of nitrogen runoff is needed if the dead zone is to shrink. Reversal The recovery of benthic communities is primarily dependent upon the length and severity of hypoxic conditions inside the hypoxic zone. Less severe conditions and temporary depletion of oxygen allow rapid recovery of benthic communities in the area due to reestablishment by benthic larvae from adjacent areas, with longer conditions of hypoxia and more severe oxygen depletion leading to longer reestablishment periods. Recovery also depends upon stratification levels within the area, so heavily stratified areas in warmer waters are less likely to recover from anoxic or hypoxic conditions in addition to being more susceptible to eutrophication driven hypoxia. The difference in recovery ability and susceptibility to hypoxia in stratified marine environments is expected to complicate recovery efforts of dead zones in the future if ocean warming continues. Small scale hypoxic systems with rich surrounding communities are the most likely to recover after nutrient influxes leading to eutrophication stop. However, depending on the extent of damage and characteristics of the zone, large scale hypoxic condition could also potentially recover after a period of a decade. For example, the Black Sea dead zone, previously the largest in the world, largely disappeared between 1991 and 2001 after fertilizers became too costly to use following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demise of centrally planned economies in Eastern and Central Europe. Fishing has again become a major economic activity in the region. While the Black Sea \\"cleanup\\" was largely unintentional and involved a drop in hard-to-control fertilizer usage, the U.N. has advocated other cleanups by reducing large industrial emissions. From 1985 to 2000, the North Sea dead zone had nitrogen reduced by 37% when policy efforts by countries on the Rhine River reduced sewage and industrial emissions of nitrogen into the water. Other cleanups have taken place along the Hudson River'Dead Zones' Multiplying In World's Oceans by John Nielsen. 15 Aug 2008, Morning Edition, NPR. and San Francisco Bay.

Lanza began studying to be a professional singer at the age of 16. After appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1947, Lanza signed a seven-year film contract with Louis B. Mayer, the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who saw his performance and was impressed by his singing. Prior to that, the adult Lanza had sung only two performances of an opera. The following year (1948), however, he sang the role of Pinkerton in Puccini's Madame Butterfly in New Orleans.Bessette, Roland L. Mario Lanza: Tenor in Exile, Amadeus (1999), p. 65 His film début for MGM was in That Midnight Kiss (1949) with Kathryn Grayson and Ethel Barrymore. A year later, in The Toast of New Orleans, his featured popular song \\"Be My Love\\" became his first million-selling hit. In 1951, he played the role of tenor Enrico Caruso, his idol, in the biopic The Great Caruso, which produced another million-seller with \\"The Loveliest Night of the Year\\" (a song which used the melody of Sobre las Olas). The Great Caruso was the top-grossing film that year.Vogel, Michelle. Children of Hollywood, McFarland (2005), p. 65. The title song of his next film, Because You're Mine, was his final million-selling hit song. The song went on to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. After recording the soundtrack for his next film, The Student Prince, he embarked upon a protracted battle with studio head Dore Schary arising from artistic differences with director Curtis Bernhardt, and was eventually dismissed by MGM. Lanza was known to be \\"rebellious, tough, and ambitious.\\" During most of his film career, he suffered from addictions to overeating and alcohol which had a serious effect on his health and his relationships with directors, producers and, occasionally, other cast members. Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper writes that \\"his smile, which was as big as his voice, was matched with the habits of a tiger cub, impossible to housebreak.\\" She adds that he was the \\"last of the great romantic performers\\".Hopper, Hedda. The Whole Truth and Nothing But, Pyramid Books (1963), chapter 18. He made three more films before dying of an apparent pulmonary embolism at the age of 38. At the time of his death in 1959 he was still \\"the most famous tenor in the world\\". Author Eleonora Kimmel concludes that Lanza \\"blazed like a meteor whose light lasts a brief moment in time\\".Kimmel, Eleonora. Altered and Unfinished Lives, A.F.A. (2006) p. 191. Early years Mario Lanza birthplace, 636 Christian Street, Philadelphia June 8, 2016 (Demolished July 2018) Born Alfredo Arnold Cocozza in Philadelphia, he was exposed to classical singing at an early age by his Abruzzese-Molisan Italian parents. His mother Maria Lanza was from Tocco da Casauria, a town in the province of Pescara in the region of Abruzzo. His father Antonio Cocozza was from Filignano, a town in the province of Isernia in the region of Molise. By age 16, his vocal talent had become apparent. Starting out in local operatic productions in Philadelphia for the YMCA Opera Company while still in his teens, he later came to the attention of longtime (1924–49) principal Boston Symphony conductor Serge Koussevitzky. In 1942, Koussevitzky provided young Cocozza with a full student scholarship to the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, Massachusetts. Reportedly, Koussevitzky later told him \\"Yours is a voice such as is heard once in a hundred years.\\"Briggs, John. Leonard Bernstein: The Man, His Work, and His World, World Pub. (1961), p. 55. Opera career He made his opera debut as Fenton in Otto Nicolai's The Merry Wives of Windsor (in English) at the Berkshire Music Festival in Tanglewood on August 7, 1942, after a period of study with conductors Boris Goldovsky and Leonard Bernstein. This was when Cocozza adopted the stage name Mario Lanza for its similarity to his mother’s maiden name, Maria Lanza.Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville (2nd. ed, 2008), p. 21. His performances at Tanglewood won him critical acclaim, with Noel Straus of The New York Times hailing the 21-year-old tenor as having \\"few equals among tenors of the day in terms of quality, warmth and power\\". Herbert Graf subsequently wrote in Opera News (October 5, 1942), \\"A real find of the season was Mario Lanza [...] He would have no difficulty one day being asked to join the Metropolitan Opera.\\" Lanza sang Nicolai's Fenton twice at Tanglewood, in addition to appearing there in a one-off presentation of Act III of Puccini's La bohème with the noted Mexican soprano Irma González, baritone James Pease and mezzo-soprano Laura Castellano. Music critic Jay C. Rosenfeld wrote in The New York Times of August 9, 1942, \\"Irma González as Mimì and Mario Lanza as Rodolfo were conspicuous by the beauty of their voices and the vividness of their characterizations.\\" In an interview shortly before her own death in 2008, González recalled that Lanza was \\"very correct, likeable, with a powerful and beautiful voice\\".Zermeño, Erick B. Interview with Irma González. Pro Ópera (April 2008), pp. 32–35. Lanza as Giuseppe Verdi's Otello His budding operatic career was interrupted by World War II, when he was assigned to Special Services in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He appeared in the wartime shows On the Beam and Winged Victory. He also appeared in the film version of the latter (albeit as an unrecognizable member of the chorus). He resumed his singing career with a concert in Atlantic City, New Jersey with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in September 1945 under Peter Herman Adler, subsequently his mentor. The following month, he replaced tenor Jan Peerce on the live CBS radio program Great Moments in Music on which he made six appearances in four months, singing extracts from various operas and other works.Mannering, Derek. Mario Lanza: Singing to the Gods, University Press of Mississippi (2005), pp. 33–34. He studied with Enrico Rosati for 15 months, and then embarked on an 86-concert tour of the United States, Canada and Mexico between July 1947 and May 1948 with bass George London and soprano Frances Yeend. Reviewing his second appearance at Chicago's Grant Park in July 1947 in the Chicago Sunday Tribune, Claudia Cassidy praised Lanza's \\"superbly natural tenor\\" and observed that \\"though a multitude of fine points evade him, he possesses the things almost impossible to learn. He knows the accent that makes a lyric line reach its audience, and he knows why opera is music drama.\\"Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville (2004), p. 60. In April 1948, Lanza sang two performances as Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly for the New Orleans Opera Association conducted by Walter Herbert with stage director Armando Agnini. Reviewing the opening-night performance in the St. Louis News (April 9, 1948), Laurence Oden wrote \\"Mario Lanza performed ... Lieutenant Pinkerton with considerable verve and dash. Rarely have we seen a more superbly romantic leading tenor. His exceptionally beautiful voice helps immeasurably.\\" Following the success of these performances, he was invited to return to New Orleans in 1949 as Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata. But, as biographer Armando Cesari wrote, Lanza by 1949 \\"was already deeply engulfed in the Hollywood machinery and consequently never learned [that key mid-Verdi tenor] role.\\"Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville (2004), p. 78. At the time of his death, Lanza was preparing to return to the operatic stage. Conductor Peter Herman Adler, with whom Lanza previously had worked both in concert and on the soundtrack of The Great Caruso, visited the tenor in Rome during the summer of 1959 and later recalled that \\"[Lanza] was working two hours a day with an operatic coach, and intended to go back to opera, his only true love.\\" Adler promised the tenor \\"all possible help\\" in his \\"planning for his operatic future.\\"Mannering, Derek. Mario Lanza: Singing to the Gods, UP of Mississippi (2005), p. 201. In the October 14, 1959, edition of Variety, it was reported that Lanza had planned to make his return to opera in the role of Canio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci during the Rome Opera's 1960–61 season. This was subsequently confirmed by Riccardo Vitale, artistic director of the Rome Opera.Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville (2004), p. 275. Variety also noted that preparations had been underway at the time of Lanza's death for him to participate in recording a series of complete operas for RCA Italiana.Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville (2004), p. 277. Film career A concert at the Hollywood Bowl in August 1947 had brought Lanza to the attention of Louis B. Mayer, who promptly signed Lanza to a seven-year film contract with Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. The contract required him to commit to the studio for six months, and at first Lanza believed he would be able to combine his film career with his operatic and concert one. In May 1949, he made his first commercial recordings with RCA Victor. His rendition of the aria \\"Che gelida manina\\" (from La bohème) from that session was subsequently awarded the prize of Operatic Recording of the Year by the (United States) National Record Critics Association.Mannering, Derek. Mario Lanza: Singing to the Gods, University Press of Mississippi (2005), p. 61. =The Toast of New Orleans= Lanza's first two starring films, That Midnight Kiss and The Toast of New Orleans, both opposite top-billed Kathryn Grayson, were commercial successes, and in 1950 his recording of \\"Be My Love\\" from the latter became the first of three million-selling singles for the young singer, earning him enormous fame in the process. While at MGM, Lanza worked closely with the Academy Award- winning conductor, composer, and arranger Johnny Green. In a 1977 interview with Lanza biographer Armando Cesari, Green recalled that the tenor was insecure about the manner in which he had become successful, and was keenly aware of the fact that he had become a Hollywood star before first having established himself on the operatic stage. > Had [Lanza] been already a leading tenor, if not the leading tenor at the > Met[ropolitan Opera House], and come to Hollywood in between seasons to make > a picture, he would have had [the security of having] the Met as his home,\\" > Green remarked. According to Green, Lanza possessed \\"the voice of the next > Caruso. [Lanza] had an unusual, very unusual quality ... a tenor with a > baritone color in the middle and lower registers, and a great feeling for > the making of music. A great musicality. I found it fascinating, musically, > to work with [him].Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, > Baskerville (2004), p. 132. =The Great Caruso= In 1951, Lanza portrayed Enrico Caruso in The Great Caruso, which was MGM's biggest success of the year. At the same time, Lanza's increasing popularity exposed him to intense criticism by some music critics, including those who had praised his work years earlier. His performance earned him compliments from the subject's son, Enrico Caruso Jr., a tenor in his own right. Shortly before his own death in 1987, Enrico Jr. wrote in Enrico Caruso: My Father and My Family (posthumously published in 1990) that: > I can think of no other tenor, before or since Mario Lanza, who could have > risen with comparable success to the challenge of playing Caruso in a screen > biography ... Lanza was born with one of the dozen or so great tenor voices > of the century, with a natural voice placement, an unmistakable and very > pleasing timbre, and a nearly infallible musical instinct. =The Student Prince= Richard Tucker (left) speaking with Lanza in 1958 at Tucker's Covent Garden debut. In 1952, Lanza was dismissed by MGM after he had recorded the songs for The Student Prince. The reason most frequently cited in the tabloid press at the time was that his recurring weight problem had made it impossible for him to fit into the costumes of the Prince.Stern, Michael. An American in Rome, B. Geis Associates/Random House (1964), p. 287. However, as his biographers Cesari and Mannering have established, Lanza was not overweight at the beginning of the production, and it was, in fact, a disagreement with director Curtis Bernhardt over Lanza's singing of one of the songs in the film that led to Lanza walking off the set. MGM refused to replace Bernhardt, and the film was subsequently made with English actor Edmund Purdom, who was dubbed to Lanza's recorded singing voice.Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville (2nd. ed., 2008), p. 168. Depressed by his dismissal, and with his self-confidence severely undermined, Lanza became a virtual recluse for more than a year, frequently seeking refuge in alcoholic binges. During this period, Lanza also came very close to bankruptcy as a result of poor investment decisions by his former manager, and his lavish spending habits left him owing about $250,000 in back taxes to the IRS.Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville (2nd ed., 2008), p. 167. =Serenade= Lanza returned to an active film career in 1955 in Serenade, released by Warner Bros. However the film was not as successful as his previous films, despite its strong musical content, including arias from Der Rosenkavalier, Fedora, L'arlesiana, and Otello, as well as the Act I duet from Otello with soprano Licia Albanese. Mme. Albanese said of Lanza in 1980: > I had heard all sorts of stories about Mario [Lanza]. That his voice was too > small for the stage, that he couldn't learn a score, that he couldn't > sustain a full opera; in fact, that he couldn't even sing a full aria, that > his recordings were made by splicing together various portions of an aria. > None of it is true! He had the most beautiful lirico spinto voice. It was a > gorgeous, beautiful, powerful voice. I should know because I sang with so > many tenors. He had everything that one needs. The voice, the temperament, > perfect diction. ... Vocally he was vsingiLecure. All he needed was > coaching. Everything was so easy for him. He was fantastic! Lanza moved to Rome, Italy in May 1957, where he worked on the film Seven Hills of Rome, and returned to performing live in November of that year, singing for Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Show at the London Palladium. From January to April 1958, Lanza gave a concert tour of the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany. He gave a total of 22 concerts on this tour, receiving mostly positive reviews for his singing.Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: an American Tragedy, Baskerville (2nd. ed. 2008), pp. 251–55. Despite a number of cancellations, which resulted from his poor health during this period, Lanza continued to receive offers for operatic appearances, concerts, and films.Mannering, Derek. Mario Lanza: Singing to the Gods, University Press of Mississippi (2005), p. 175. In September 1958, he made a number of operatic recordings at the Rome Opera House for the soundtrack of what would turn out to be his final film, For the First Time. It was then that he came to the attention of that opera house's artistic director, Riccardo Vitale, who promptly offered the tenor carte blanche in his choice of operatic roles. Lanza also received offers to sing in any opera of his choosing from the San Carlo in Naples. At the same time, however, his health continued to decline, with the tenor suffering from a variety of ailments, including phlebitis and acute high blood pressure. His old habits of overeating and crash dieting, coupled with binge drinking, compounded his problems.Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: an American Tragedy, Baskerville (2nd. ed. 2008), p. 280. Death In April 1959, Lanza reportedly fell ill, mainly with heart problems as well as pneumonia. On September 25, 1959, he entered Rome's Valle Giulia clinic for the purpose of losing weight for an upcoming film. While in the clinic, he underwent a controversial weight loss program colloquially known as \\"the twilight sleep treatment\\", which required its patients to be kept immobile and sedated for prolonged periods. On October 7, Lanza died of an apparent pulmonary embolism at the age of 38. No autopsy was performed. He was survived by his wife and four children. Betty Lanza returned to Hollywood completely devastated. She died five months later of a drug overdose.Cesari, Armando and Philip A. Mackowiak, M.D. Mario Lanza: A Fatal Zest for Living, The Pharos (Winter 2010), pp. 4–10. Maria Caniglia, Franco Fabrizi and Enzo Fiermonte attended the funeral. Frank Sinatra sent his condolences by telegram. From the film Toast of New Orleans, as Lt. Pinkerton USN, in recreation of the opera Madama Butterfly In 1991, his son Marc Lanza died of a heart attack. He was 37, a year younger than Mario was when he died. In 1998, daughter Colleen Lanza was killed by a car as she crossed a street. She spent two weeks in the hospital in a coma from which she never recovered. Son Damon Anthony Lanza died on August 16, 2008 in California at the age of 55. Musical legacy Lanza was the first RCA Victor Red Seal artist to win a gold disc and the first artist to sell 2 1/2 million albumsHopkins, Jerry. Elvis: The Final Years, Mass Market (1986), p. 79. Lanza was referred to by some sources as the \\"new Caruso\\" after his \\"instant success\\" in Hollywood films,Cesari, Armando. Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy, Baskerville Publishers (2004) p. 4. while MGM hoped he would become the movie studio's \\"singing Clark Gable\\" for his good looks and powerful voice.Fischer, Lucy; Landy, Marcia. Stars: The Film Reader, Routledge (2004) p. 216. Lanza was a big inspiration to fellow RCA Victor recording star Elvis Presley. A year after Lanza's death, Elvis recorded an English translation of O Sole Mio, which was popularized by Lanza. This song, It's Now or Never, went on to be one of Elvis' all time best selling songs.Patterson, Nigel INFLUENCES ON A LEGEND 8: MARIO LANZA, Elvis Monthly #468 (December 1998) p. 5-8. In 1994, outstanding tenor José Carreras paid tribute to Lanza during a worldwide concert tour, saying of him, \\"If I'm an opera singer, it's thanks to Mario Lanza.\\" His equally outstanding colleague Plácido Domingo echoed these comments in a 2009 CBS interview with, \\"Lanza's passion and the way his voice sounds are what made me sing opera. I actually owe my love for opera ... to a kid from Philadelphia.\\" Even today \\"the magnitude of his contribution to popular music is still hotly debated,\\" and because he appeared on the operatic stage only twice, many critics feel that he needed to have had more \\"operatic quality time\\" in major theaters before he could be considered a star of that art form.Mannering, Derek. Mario Lanza: Singing to the Gods, Univ. Press of Mississippi (2005) pp. xv–xvii. His films, especially The Great Caruso, influenced numerous future opera stars, including Joseph Calleja, José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Vyacheslav Polozov. According to opera historian Clyde McCants, \\"Of all the Hollywood singers who performed operatic music ... the one who made the greatest impact was Mario Lanza.\\"McCants, Clyde T. American Opera Singers and Their Recordings, McFarland (2004), p. 132. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper concluded that \\"there had never been anyone like Mario, and I doubt whether we shall ever see his like again\\". Portrayal on stage In October 2007, Charles Messina directed the big budget musical Be My Love: The Mario Lanza Story, written by Richard Vetere, about Lanza's life, which was produced by Sonny Grosso and Phil Ramone, and which premiered at The Tilles Center for the Performing Arts in Greenvale, New York. Legacy Mario Lanza Boulevard is a roadway in the Eastwick section of Lanza's native Philadelphia, close to Philadelphia International Airport and ending on the grounds of the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge. The Mario Lanza Institute and Museum, which honors Lanza's legacy and also provides scholarships to young singers, is located at 712 Montrose Street in South Philadelphia. Mario Lanza Park 235 Queen St Philadelphia's Queen Street Park was renamed for Lanza in 1967. Lanza was born at 636 Christian Street in South Philadelphia. The building was demolished on June 29, 2018; a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission marker marks the site. In 1983, a 90-minute PBS documentary, Mario Lanza: The American Caruso, hosted by Plácido Domingo and featuring Lanza's family and professional associates; was nominated for a Primetime Emmy as \\"Outstanding Informational Special.\\" In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. Mario Lanza has been awarded two Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a Star for Recording at 1751 Vine Street, and a Star at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard for Motion Pictures.

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. , , et seq., October 21, 1976. History and goals Congress enacted RCRA to address the increasing problems the nation faced from its growing volume of municipal and industrial waste. RCRA was an amendment of the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965. The act set national goals for: * Protecting human health and the natural environment from the potential hazards of waste disposal. * Energy conservation and natural resources. * Reducing the amount of waste generated, through source reduction and recycling * Ensuring the management of waste in an environmentally sound manner. The RCRA program is a joint federal and state endeavor, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) providing basic requirements that states then adopt, adapt, and enforce.Horinko, Marianne, Cathryn Courtin. “Waste Management: A Half Century of Progress.” EPA Alumni Association. March 2016. RCRA is now most widely known for the regulations promulgated under it that set standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste in the United States. However, it also plays an integral role in the management of municipal and industrial waste as well as underground storage tanks. Implementation EPA has published waste management regulations, which are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations at parts 239 through 282.Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) (1998). \\"40 CFR Subchapter I - SOLID WASTES .\\" Regulations regarding management of hazardous waste begin in part 260.EPA (2011). \\"Hazardous Waste Regulations.\\" States are authorized to operate their own hazardous waste programs, which must be at least as stringent as federal standards, and are tasked with creating state implementation plans for managing solid waste. Provisions Types of solid waste =Subtitle A: General Provisions= * Congressional Findings; Objectives and National Policy * Definitions * Interstate Cooperation; Application of Act and Integration with Other Acts * Financial Disclosure; Solid Waste Management Information and Guidelines =Subtitle B: Office of Solid Waste; Authorities of the Administrator= * Office of Solid Waste and Interagency Coordinating Committee * Authorities of EPA Administrator * Resource Recovery and Conservation Panels; Grants * Annual Report; Office of Ombudsman =Subtitle C: \\"Cradle to Grave\\" requirements for hazardous waste= Arguably the most notable provisions of the RCRA statute are included in Subtitle C, which directs EPA to establish controls on the management of hazardous wastes from their point of generation, through their transportation and treatment, storage and/or disposal. Because RCRA requires controls on hazardous waste generators (i.e., sites that generate hazardous waste), transporters, and treatment, storage and disposal facilities (i.e., facilities that ultimately treat/dispose of or recycle the hazardous waste), the overall regulatory framework has become known as the \\"cradle to grave\\" system. States are authorized to implement their own hazardous waste programs. The statute imposes stringent recordkeeping and reporting requirements on generators, transporters, and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities handling hazardous waste. EPA graphic explaining municipal solid waste =Subtitle D: Non-hazardous Solid Wastes= This section of the act banned open landfills. It also provides criteria for landfills and other waste disposal facilities. Subtitle D includes garbage (e.g., food containers, coffee grounds), non-recycled household appliances, residue from incinerated automobile tires, refuse such as metal scrap, construction materials, and sludge from industrial and municipal waste water facilities and drinking water treatment plants. It also detailed that non-hazardous solid wastes include certain hazardous wastes which are exempted from the Subtitle C regulations, such as hazardous wastes from households and from conditionally exempt small quantity generators. Special wastes Congress also designated several kinds of industrial wastes as \\"special wastes,\\" which are exempt from Subtitle C, including oil and gas exploration and production wastes (such as drill cuttings, produced water, and drilling fluids), coal combustion residuals generated by electric power plants and other industries, mining waste, and cement kiln dust. See Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980. =Subtitle E: Department of Commerce responsibilities= * Development of Specifications for secondary materials; Development of markets for recovered material. * Technology promotion =Subtitle F: Federal responsibilities= * Application of Federal, State and Local Law to Federal Facilities * Federal procurement * Cooperation with EPA; Applicability of solid waste disposal guidelines to executive agencies =Subtitle G: Miscellaneous provisions= * Whistleblower protection. Employees in the United States who believe they were fired or suffered another adverse action related to enforcement of this law have 30 days to file a written complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. * Citizen Suits; Imminent Hazard suits * Petition for regulations; Public participation =Subtitle H: Research, Development, Demonstration and Information= * Research, Demonstrations, Training; Special Studies * Coordination, collection, dissemination of information =Subtitle I: Underground Storage Tanks= ;Background The operation of underground storage tanks (USTs) became subject to the RCRA regulatory program with enactment of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA).United States. Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. , , November 8, 1984. At that time there were about 2.1 million tanks subject to federal regulation, and the EPA program led to closure and removal of most substandard tanks.EPA (2011). \\"Overview Of The Federal UST Program.\\" As of 2009 there were approximately 600,000 active USTs at 223,000 sites subject to federal regulation.EPA (2010). \\"FY 2009 Annual Report On The Underground Storage Tank Program.\\" Document no. EPA-510-R-10-001. ;Regulatory requirements The federal UST regulations cover tanks storing petroleum or listed hazardous substances, and define the types of tanks permitted. EPA established a tank notification system to track UST status. UST regulatory programs are principally administered by state and U.S. territorial agencies. The regulations set standards for: * Groundwater monitoring * Double liners * Release detection, prevention and correction * Spill control * Overfill control (for petroleum products) * Restrictions on land disposal of untreatable hazardous waste products. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) required owners and operators of USTs to ensure corrective action is completed when a tank is in need of repair, or removal, when it is necessary to protect human health and the environment.Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, , . October 17, 1986. The amendments established a trust fund to pay for the cleanup of leaking UST sites where responsible parties cannot be identified. It is also recommended that above-ground storage tanks are used whenever possible. =Subtitle J: Medical Waste (expired)= RCRA Subtitle J regulated medical waste in four states (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island) and Puerto Rico, and expired on March 22, 1991. (See Medical Waste Tracking Act.) State environmental and health agencies regulate medical waste, rather than EPA. Other federal agencies have issued safety regulations governing the handling of medical waste, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration. Amendments and related legislation=Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980= Congress exempted several types of wastes from classification as hazardous under Subtitle C in its 1980 amendment to RCRA. The Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980United States. Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980. , October 12, 1980. designated the following categories as \\"special wastes\\" and not subject to the stricter permitting requirements of Subtitle C: * coal combustion residuals (CCR) generated by electric power plants and other industries, including fly ash, bottom ash, slag waste and flue-gas desulfurization wastes * mining waste from ore mines and mineral mines * cement kiln dust * drilling fluid, produced water, and other wastes from oil and gas wells.RCRA sec. 3001(b)(3)(A), ; sec. 3001(b)(2)(A), These legislative exemptions, known as the \\"Bevill exclusion\\" and the \\"Bentsen exclusion\\", were intended to be temporary, pending studies conducted by EPA and subsequent determinations as to whether any of these waste categories should be classified as hazardous. In its reviews following the 1980 amendments, EPA determined that most of the exempted waste types would continue to be classified as non-hazardous. Regulations EPA published a CCR regulation in 2015 that would restrict the continued use of unlined ash ponds (surface impoundments) by coal-fired power plants.EPA. \\"Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities.\\" Federal Register, , April 17, 2015. This regulation, was which was modified by the Trump administration in 2018,EPA. \\"Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; Amendments to the National Minimum Criteria (Phase One, Part One).\\" , July 30, 2018. has been challenged in litigation and remanded to EPA for further revision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, et al. v. EPA, . In response to the court decision, EPA published a proposed rule on December 2, 2019 that would establish an August 31, 2020 deadline for facilities to stop placing ash in unlined impoundments. The proposal would also provide additional time for some facilities—up to eight years—to find alternatives for managing ash wastes before closing surface impoundments.EPA. \\"Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline To Initiate Closure.\\" Proposed rule. Federal Register, . 2019-12-02. =Superfund= The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as \\"Superfund,\\" was enacted in 1980 to address the problem of remediating abandoned hazardous waste sites, by establishing legal liability, as well as a trust fund for cleanup activities.United States. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. , , et seq., December 11, 1980. In general CERCLA applies to contaminated sites, while RCRA's focus is on controlling the ongoing generation and management of particular waste streams. RCRA, like CERCLA, has provisions to require cleanup of contaminated sites that occurred in the past. =Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984= In 1984 Congress expanded the scope of RCRA with the enactment of Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA). The amendments strengthened the law by covering small quantity generators of hazardous waste and establishing requirements for hazardous waste incinerators, and the closing of substandard landfills. =Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996= The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996 allowed some flexibility in the procedures for land disposal of certain wastes. For example, a waste is not subject to land disposal restrictions if it is sent to an industrial wastewater treatment facility, a municipal sewage treatment plant, or is treated in a \\"zero discharge\\" facility.United States. Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996. , , . March 26, 1996. Treatment, storage, and disposal facility permits Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) manage hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle C and generally must have a permit in order to operate. While most facilities have RCRA permits, some continue to operate under what is called \\"interim status.\\" Interim status requirements appear in 40 CFR Part 265.EPA. \\"Part 265 – Interim Status Standards For Owners And Operators Of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, And Disposal Facilities.\\" . The permitting requirements for TSDFs appear in 40 CFR Parts 264 and 270.EPA. \\"Part 264 – Standards For Owners And Operators Of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, And Disposal Facilities.\\" . \\"Part 270 – EPA Administered Permit Programs: The Hazardous Waste Permit Program .\\" . TSDFs manage (treat, store, or dispose) hazardous waste in units that may include: container storage areas, tanks, surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment units, landfills, incinerators, containment buildings, and/or drip pads. The unit-specific permitting and operational requirements are described in further detail in 40 CFR Part 264, Subparts J through DD.

At the end of the interest-only term the borrower must renegotiate another interest-only mortgage, pay the principal, or, if previously agreed, convert the loan to a principal-and-interest payment (amortized) loan at the borrower's option. By country=United States= In the United States, a five- or ten-year interest-only period is typical. After this time, the principal balance is amortized for the remaining term. In other words, if a borrower had a thirty-year mortgage loan and the first ten years were interest only, at the end of the first ten years, the principal balance would be amortized for the remaining period of twenty years. The practical result is that the early payments (in the interest-only period) are substantially lower than the later payments. This gives the borrower more flexibility because the borrower is not forced to make payments towards principal. Indeed, it also enables a borrower who expects to increase his salary substantially over the course of the loan to borrow more than the borrower would have otherwise been able to afford, or investors to generate cashflow when they might not otherwise be able to. During the interest-only years of the mortgage, the loan balance will not decrease unless the borrower makes additional payments towards principal. Under a conventional amortizing mortgage, the portion of a payment that applies to principal is significantly smaller than the portion that applies to interest in the early years (the same period of time that would be interest-only). Interest-only loans represent a somewhat higher risk for lenders, and therefore are subject to a slightly higher interest rate. Combined with little or no down payment, the adjustable rate (ARM) variety of interest-only mortgages are sometimes indicative of a buyer taking on too much risk—especially when that buyer is unlikely to qualify under more conservative loan structures.\\"Beware of interest-only loans\\", Forbes.com Because a homeowner does not build any equity in an interest-only loan he may be adversely affected by prevailing market conditions at the time the borrower is ready to either sell the house or refinance. The borrower may find themselves unable to afford the higher regularly amortized payments at the end of the interest-only period, unable to refinance due to lack of equity, and unable to sell if demand for housing has weakened. Due to the speculative aspects of relying on home appreciation which may or may not happen, many financial experts such as Suze Orman advise against interest-only loans for which a borrower would not otherwise qualify.\\"Yahoo Finance - Loser Loans\\" The types of interest-only loans that rely on home appreciation would be negative amortization loans, which most financial institutions discontinued in mid-2008. A recent study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago verified that most Americans can benefit from funding tax-deferred accounts rather than paying down mortgage balances. Homeowners sometimes use interest-only loans for freeing up monthly cash to fund retirement accounts. 3.4 million households don't contribute at all to their retirement but do accelerate the paying down of their mortgages. \\"Those households are losing from 11 to 17 cents for each dollar they put into a faster mortgage payoff\\", per a Chicago Federal Reserve study reiterated in the Chicago Tribune. =United Kingdom= Interest-only loans are popular ways of borrowing money to buy an asset that is unlikely to depreciate much and which can be sold at the end of the loan to repay the capital. For example, second homes, or properties bought for letting to others. In the United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s a popular way to buy a house was to combine an interest- only loan with an endowment policy, the combination being known as an endowment mortgage. Homeowners were told that the endowment policy would cover the mortgage and provide a lump sum in addition. Many of these endowment policies were poorly managed and failed to deliver the promised amounts, some of which did not even cover the cost of the mortgage. This mis-selling, combined with the poor stock market performance of the late 1990s, has resulted in endowment mortgages becoming unpopular. =Canada= It is possible, though extremely rare, to obtain interest only payments on a standard amortizing mortgage in Canada. =India= After the entry of private banks into the Indian banking sector, which was earlier dominated by nationalized banks, interest-only loans have been introduced. These loans are given provided that the borrower hands over a security (like gold ornaments) or the documents of the same (house papers) to the bank. Gold loans are the most common interest-only loans in India. =Singapore= In Singapore, interest-only mortgages had been disallowed since 14 September 2009. The reason for this was that this type of mortgage encouraged property speculations. Buyers will buy a private house while it is still under construction, and pay only the interest of the mortgage until the property is completed. Due to the lower monthly repayment (interest only) during the construction phase, some investors, thus, will acquire the house with the intention of selling it at a profit before the construction is completed.\\"Measures to Ensure a Stable and Sustainable Property Market\\", MAS. Economic effects Interest-only securities are sometimes generated artificially from structured securities, particularly CMOs. A pool of securities (typically mortgages) is created, and divided into tranches; the cash received from the underlying debts are spread through the tranches according to predefined rules. An Interest-only (IO) security is one type of tranche that can be created, it is generally created in tandem with a principal-only (PO) tranche. These tranches will cater to two particular types of investors, depending on whether the investors are trying to increase their current yield (which they can get from an IO), or trying to reduce their exposure to prepayments of the loans (which they can get from a PO). The investment returns on IOs and POs depend heavily on mortgage prepayment rates and permit investors to benefit from different prepayment expectations.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 4 (Thomson West, 2014 ed.). Many U.S. markets saw home values increase by as much as four times in a five-year span in the early 2000s. Interest-only loans helped homeowners afford more home and earn more appreciation during this time period. However, interest-only loans contributed greatly to creating the subsequent housing bubble situation, because variable-rate borrowers could not afford the fully indexed rate. Interest-only loans are disadvantaged for borrowers when housing prices drop, making the mortgage larger than the value of the house.\\"Why Homeowners Get Rich and Renters Stay Poor\\", Yahoo Finance See also *Adjustable-rate mortgage *Fixed-rate mortgage *Mortgage loan *Endowment policy *UK mortgage terminology *Balloon payment mortgage *United States housing bubble *Clap note, a form of interest only loan References Mortgage Only loan Loans ","title":"Interest-only loan"},{"id":"626121","text":"Great Britain *Bombay and Madras – Warren Hastings Portugal * Angola – António de Lencastre, Governor of Angola (1772–1779) * Macau – Diogo Fernandes Salema e Saldanha, Governor of Macau (1771–1777) Colonial governors Colonial governors 1774 ","title":"List of colonial governors in 1774"},{"id":"626122","text":"Portugal * Angola – António de Lencastre, Governor of Angola (1772–79) * Macau – Diogo Fernandes Salema e Saldanha, Governor of Macau (1771–77) Colonial governors Colonial governors 1775 ","title":"List of colonial governors in 1775"},{"id":"626124","text":"Portugal * Angola – António de Lencastre, Governor of Angola (1772–79) * Macau – Diogo Fernandes Salema e Saldanha, Governor of Macau (1771–77) Colonial governors Colonial governors 1776 ","title":"List of colonial governors in 1776"},{"id":"626125","text":"Portugal * Angola – António de Lencastre, Governor of Angola (1772–1779) * Macau – *# Diogo Fernandes Salema e Saldanha, Governor of Macau (1771–1777) *# D.

Left to right: bridge, middle and neck pickups. String effect on a single coil (electric guitar). The coil is connected to a multimeter that indicates the voltage changes when the string moves. This signal is normally sent to an amplifier. A single coil pickup is a type of magnetic transducer, or pickup, for the electric guitar and the electric bass. It electromagnetically converts the vibration of the strings to an electric signal. Single coil pickups are one of the two most popular designs, along with dual-coil or \\"humbucking\\" pickups.  History = Beauchamp = Sketch of Rickenbacker \\"frying pan\\" lap steel guitar from 1934 patent application In the mid-1920s George Beauchamp, a Los Angeles, California guitarist, began experimentation with electric amplification of the guitar. Originally using a phonograph pickup assembly, Beauchamp began testing many different combinations of coils and magnets hoping to create the first electromagnetic guitar pickup. He wound his earliest coils using a motor out of a washing machine, later on switching to a sewing machine motor, and eventually using single coiled magnets. Beauchamp was backed in his efforts by Adolph Rickenbacker, an engineer and wealthy owner of a successful tool and die business. Beauchamp eventually produced the first successful single coil pickup. The pickup consisted of two massive \\"U\\" shaped magnets and one coil and was known as the \\"horseshoe pickup\\". The two horseshoe-shaped magnets surrounded the strings that passed over a single core plate (or blade) in the center of the coil. = Gibson = The Gibson Guitar Corporation introduced the \\"bar pickup\\" in 1935 for its new line of Hawaiian lap steel guitars. The pickup's basic construction is that of a metal blade inserted through the coil as a shared pole piece for all the strings. A pair of large flat magnets were fastened below the coil assembly. In 1936 Gibson introduced the ES-150, its first electric Spanish styled guitar. The ES-150 was outfitted with the bar pickup. Jazz guitar innovator, Charlie Christian, began playing an ES-150 in the late 1930s with the Benny Goodman Orchestra. This caused the popularity of the electrified guitar to soar. Due to Christian's close association with the ES-150 it began being referred to as the \\"Charlie Christian Model\\" and Gibson's now famous bar pickup as the \\"Charlie Christian pickup\\" or \\"CC unit\\".  Common designs = Gibson P-90 = The P-90 is a single-coil pickup designed by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. These pickups have a large, flat coil with adjustable steel screws as pole pieces, and a pair of flat alnico bar magnets lying under the coil bobbin. The adjustable pole pieces pick up the magnetism from the magnets. Moving the screw closer or further away from the magnet determines signal strength, thus tone as well. There are two variations of P-90 pickup that differ mainly by mounting options: Gibson P-90 soap bar * Soap bar casing has true rectangular shape and the mounting screws are contained within the coil perimeter, positioned between the pole pieces, between strings 2-3 and 4-5, thus creating irregular and somewhat unusual pattern. Occasionally, they are mistaken for pole pieces; thus, the P-90 is sometimes erroneously said to have eight pole pieces. The \\"soap bar\\" nickname most probably comes from its predominantly rectangular shape and proportions resembling a bar of soap, and the fact that the first P-90s on the original Gibson Les Paul Model of 1952 were white. P90 dog ear * Dog ear is a casing type with extensions at both sides of pickup that somewhat resemble dog's ears. These are extensions of the predominantly rectangular cover that encompass the outlying mounting screws. Dog-ear P-90 pickups were commonly mounted on Gibson's hollowbody guitars like the ES-330 and occasionally on solid body models like the Les Paul Junior. The same pickups were also available on Epiphone models (since Gibson was building Epiphone guitars in the 1950s) and the design is best remembered for its appearance on the hollow body Epiphone Casino of the mid to late 1960s. = Telecaster design = Two pickups on a Telecaster The Fender Telecaster features two single coils. The neck pickup produces a mellower sound, while the bridge pickup produces an extremely twangy, sharp tone with exaggerated treble response, because the bridge pickup is mounted on a steel plate. These design elements allow musicians to emulate steel guitar sounds, making it particularly appropriate for country music. Pickups are selected with a three- position switch, and two wiring schemes exist: * Vintage: 1) neck pickup with treble cutoff for a bassier sound; 2) neck pickup only; 3) bridge pickup only. * Modern: 1) neck pickup only, with no treble cutoff; 2) neck and bridge; 3) bridge pickup only. The Fender Esquire has a variation to the Vintage wiring scheme by using the scheme on a single pickup. This gives a treble cutoff in the first position, normal in the middle position, and a tone control cutoff in the third position. = Stratocaster design = Stratocaster pickups, viewed along the neck profile. Note that the poles are of different heights. The traditional Stratocaster design guitar features three single coils. The guitarist can control which pickup or combination of pickups are selected with a lever switch. The pickup positions are usually referred to as the bridge, middle and neck pickups based on their proximity to those parts of the instrument. The neck pickup typically has the lowest output, with the most mid-range and bass response, whereas the bridge pickup has the higher output (because the strings at the bridge move less) and the greatest treble response, with a slight twang to it. The sound of the middle pickup is similar to that of the neck pickup, albeit with slightly less bass and more treble. However many players, such as Ritchie Blackmore, find it somewhat of an obstruction to the picking hand, so loosen the mounting screws such that it lies flush with the pickguard. Modern Stratocasters have five-position pickup selector switch. Positions 1, 3 and 5 activate only one pickup (bridge, middle or neck respectively), while positions 2 and 4 activate a combination of two pickups (bridge and middle, or middle and neck, respectively). Some pickup sets have a reverse wound and reverse polarity middle pickup that when in combination with the normal bridge or neck pickups will cancel electromagnetic interference (noise/hum) which single coil pickups suffer badly from. The sonic effect of positions 2 and 4 is sometimes referred to as a \\"quack\\" or \\"notch positions\\", and some guitar notation includes directions to use these pickup combinations. One example is \\"Sultans of Swing\\" by Dire Straits which is played in position 2 (bridge and middle).  Noise problems  Two types of noise afflict magnetic guitar pickups. Hum is caused by magnetic fields due to power frequency currents in electrical equipment, whereas buzz is propagated as radio transmissions and sounds more like static. The sources of buzz are many, but one example is an AC power tool with a brush motor. The brush makes and breaks electrical contact with the commutator segment several thousand times a second at variable frequency dependent on load thus causing radio frequency noise. Kinman Guitar Electrix were awarded 5 or more US patents beginning circa 1996 for innovative design concerned with hum canceling single pole pickups. Kinman at first concentrated on particularly the Fender type single coil pickup and in 2009 the P-90 pickup. One of the most important elements of Kinman's patents is the use of iron in the core of the noise sensing coil. This was absolutely novel in 1996 and without the presence of iron to boost the efficiency of the noise sensing coil differential coil technology would not have been possible. Vertical differential coil technique is also described in Kinman's US Patents 5,668,520 and 6,103,966 with priority date of March 1996. After 1998 DiMarzio and Seymour Duncan also began using iron and differential winding techniques in the noise sensing coils in some of their products. Over the years Kinman has improved and refined their designs to a point where the popular consensus is the sound of some models is indistinguishable from noisy single coils. Kinman also manufactures noiseless P-90 and Telecaster pickups under US Patent 7,022,909 Ilitch Electronics also patented their revolutionary hum-canceling technology which has been developed for aftermarket guitars (Strats, Teles, Gibson Les Pauls and many others). The search for an acceptable solution to mains hum gained new impetus around 1995 as guitar players became increasingly intolerant of degraded stacked single- coil sound. Fender was researching new techniques to solve the loss of tone around that time and eventually came out with their Vintage Noiseless design circa 1998.  Notable single-coil pickups  There are several well-known single-coil pickups that have a distinctive sound: \\"Lipstick\\"-style single coil pickups on a Danelectro guitar * Rickenbacker pickups (including the original 1930s \\"horseshoe\\" pickup as used in lap steel and solid-body upright basses, and later 6 string electric guitars, pedal steels, and electric bass guitars; also the \\"Toaster\\" and \\"Hi-Gain\\") * Gibson bar pickup (1935) — later called the Charlie Christian pickup (1938) * Gibson P-90 (1946) * Fender Telecaster, Stratocaster, Jazzmaster, Jaguar, and other pickups * Danelectro Lipstick * Gretsch pickups (including the \\"HiLoTron\\") * DeArmond pickups (found on various '50s and '60s guitars by various manufacturers including Gretsch, Guild, Epiphone, Martin, Kustom, Harmony, Regal, Premier, Silvertone, and others; the trade name is now owned by Fender; single coil models including the 200 aka Dynasonic, 2K, and 2000, \\"mustache\\", various \\"gold foil\\" types, and many clip on, rail, or screw mount pickups designed for acoustic guitars and other instruments). The Fender \\"Tele-Sonic\\" featured large DeArmond single-coils. * Valco single-coil pickups by Ralph Keller (1954) can be found in Airline, Supro, National, English Electronics, Custom Kraft, and a few Gretsch models of guitar from the '50s, '60s, and '70s. The majority of these pickups maintain the physical appearance of a larger, double coil humbucker pickup. Although consisting of a single coil, the pickup contains a second, off-set magnet which cancels hum. Early variations on the Valco-made over-strings \\"horseshoe\\" pickup can be found on a number of similarly branded lap steel guitars, such as Oahu. * Epiphone \\"New York\\" pickups * Lace Sensor pickups (1987)  References      External links  * The (commercial) history of Gibson pickups * Science and measurements behind electro-magnetic guitar pickups * Kinman Guitar Electrix - Impersonator 54 noiseless Strat pickup Guitar pickups Electromagnetic coils ","title":"Single coil guitar pickup"},{"id":"626131","text":"A point source is a localised, relatively small source of something.

He was a minister in the Howard Government. Early life Tuckey was born in Perth, Western Australia, and was a businessman and hotelier before entering politics. Tuckey was the last mayor of the Town of Carnarvon from 23 May 1964 until 1 March 1965, when the Town was amalgamated into the Shire, and then was the first president of the Shire of Carnarvon from 22 May 1965 until June 1971. He continued to serve as a councillor for Commercial Ward until 1979. In 1967, while a publican in Carnarvon, he was convicted of assault after striking an Aboriginal man with a length of steel cable and fined $50. The man was allegedly being held down by Tuckey's brother at the time. He has had the nickname \\"Ironbar\\" ever since. Political career Tuckey was endorsed in 1979 by the Liberal Party ahead of the 1980 election for the then-new seat of O'Connor, covering a large section of rural Western Australia. The demographics of the seat suggested it should have been a National Country seat. However, a split between the federal and state branches of the National Country Party allowed Tuckey to win on Labor preferences.http://psephos.adam- carr.net/countries/a/australia/1980/1980repswa.txt Tuckey was one of the most controversial figures in Australian federal politics. In 1986 he taunted the then Labor Treasurer, Paul Keating, in Parliament about a former girlfriend called \\"Christine,\\" leading Keating to call him \\"a piece of criminal garbage.\\"Papers on Parliament No 34 – Chapter 14 Parliament of Australia, Senate In one notorious exchange, Tuckey told Keating: \\"You are an idiot, you are a hopeless nong\\", to which Keating replied: \\"Shut up! Sit down and shut up, you pig... Why do you not shut up, you clown?... This man has a criminal intellect... this clown continues to interject in perpetuity.\\" The enraged Keating demanded that John Howard, who the previous year had become Leader of the Opposition, discipline Tuckey; but Howard refused. Keating then promised to make Howard \\"wear his leadership like a crown of thorns\\". Keating and Howard's relationship, previously a civil one, deteriorated to the point where the two men refused to speak to one another. Reportedly, the last time they talked privately was when Keating stormed into Howard's office, furiously berated him for not disciplining Tuckey, and walked out. Tuckey was a member of the Opposition shadow ministry from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1993 to 1996. He was Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the House from 1988 to 1989 and 1993 to 1994. In 1989 a group of Liberal parliamentarians, including Tuckey, plotted to remove Howard from the Opposition leadership and give the position back to Andrew Peacock (who had already held it from 1983 to 1985). After the plan succeeded, Tuckey boasted about his actions in a Four Corners interview, which privately infuriated Howard. Tuckey addressed an AIDS conference and opened by saying \\"you don't catch AIDS, you let somebody give it to you\\". =Frontbencher= As Minister for Forestry and Conservation from 1998 to 2001, Tuckey angered conservation groups through his support for the forestry industry. In 2002 he blamed the environmentalist movement for Australia's severe bushfire problem, saying that their opposition to controlled burning in national parks increased the risk of fires. In a reshuffle after the 2001 election, Tuckey was made Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. His ministerial demise came in August 2003, when it was revealed that Tuckey had written to South Australian Police minister Patrick Conlon on ministerial letterhead, asking Conlon to \\"review\\" his son's conviction on a traffic charge. Howard said that Tuckey's actions were foolish but refused to dismiss him. Tuckey resigned shortly afterwards and returned to the backbench. =Backbencher= Tuckey in 2007 In 2005 when the Australian parliament passed a motion asking Singaporean authorities that Van Tuong Nguyen not be executed for drug smuggling, Tuckey was the only member of parliament not to support it. Tuckey was often quoted in the media as supporting free markets and less government intervention in the economy. He is also well known for criticising the National Party on a number of issues. He was the most outspoken critic of the AWB in Federal Parliament, and he led the push for this board to be stripped of its export monopoly for wheat. Tuckey labelled National Party politicians who supported the single-desk system as \\"drongos\\". He also labelled National Party senator Barnaby Joyce a \\"lightweight\\" for arguing in favour of foreign ownership restrictions on Medibank Private after privatization. In August 2006, Tuckey had a public argument with Labor leader Kim Beazley over new immigration laws, ending with Tuckey calling Beazley a \\"fat so and so\\". A year later, Tuckey sent a fax to John Howard and several Liberal MPs suggesting the Prime Minister relinquish the leadership. Queensland Aboriginal activist Sam Watson, in January 2008, branded Tuckey an \\"extreme racist\\" after Tuckey had publicly deplored the decision to display traditional dancers from one of the Aboriginal tribes which historically resides near Parliament House at the opening of Federal Parliament. Watson concluded, \\"Mr Tuckey and his extremist racist views really do belong to another generation.\\" On 13 February 2008, Tuckey walked out during the opening of the 42nd Australian Federal Parliament immediately after prayers, and pointedly before the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a motion of apology to the Stolen Generation. He was one of six Liberal MPs (including fellow West Australian MPs Luke Simpkins, Dennis Jensen and the late Don Randall as well as Sophie Mirabella and the late Alby Schultz) to leave the house in protest to the apology to the Stolen Generations, thereby boycotting the motion. On the steps of parliament, Tuckey was sarcastic about what the apology would achieve for indigenous people: > \\"I'm there to say hallelujah. Tomorrow there'll be no petrol sniffing, > tomorrow little girls can sleep in their beds without any concern — it's all > fixed. The Rudd spin will fix it all. I've read it, I'm convinced. I think > it's wonderful.\\" The following May, Tuckey was expelled from the house for 24 hours after breaching standards. His remarks against the Speaker arose during a heated question time in relation to the Rudd Government's 'Fuel Watch Scheme'. On 24 September 2008, Tuckey was again expelled from the house, this time for one hour, for an outburst during House of Representatives Question Time. In March 2010, Tuckey said that acknowledging traditional landowners at official events was a \\"farce\\" and that he had \\"never thanked anyone for the right to be on the soil that is Australian\\". =Defeat= From 1983 to 2007, Tuckey held O'Connor without serious difficulty, usually taking between 62 and 75 percent of the two-party preferred vote. At the 2007 federal election, Tuckey was reelected with 46 percent of the primary vote and a two-party margin of 67 percent against Labor. However, at the 2010 federal election, Tuckey was defeated by Nationals WA candidate Tony Crook. He suffered a post-redistribution primary vote swing of 10 percent and a two-candidate swing of 20 percent, finishing on a primary vote of 38 percent and a two-candidate vote of 46 percent against Crook. He was 75 years old at the time of his defeat, making him the oldest sitting MP.O'Connor 2010 federal election results: AEC Tuckey broke his self- imposed silence after the election, verbally attacking Crook on a range of fronts. Tuckey described Crook as \\"a nobody who would be lucky to have his relatives turn up to hear his maiden speech in parliament\\". In 2009 the year before his defeat he said he might seek to become the longest serving member of parliament by breaking the record held by former Prime Minister Billy Hughes.http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2663251.htm However his defeat in 2010 dashed hopes of him achieving this record as it ended his 30 years in Parliament, nowhere near the 51 years served by Hughes from 1901 until his death in 1952.

United Kingdom In the UK an equity loan is additional borrowing, normally secured as a subsequent charge, as a top-up to the amount a home owner/purchaser can borrow from a main mortgage provider.Barclays https://www.barclays.co.uk/loans/what- are-home-equity-loans/ Often used by builders to encourage house sales but now also used by the UK governments to assist purchasers who would otherwise be unable to buy with only a conventional main mortgage. In England such loans are managed on behalf of the government by the Homes & Communities Agency. Devolved governments have their own separate schemes. Elsewhere in the world Elsewhere in the world an equity loan may refer to a mortgage loan in which the borrower receives money. Typically the loan is secured by real estate already owned outright.US News https://loans.usnews.com/home-equity- lenders For example, if a person owns a home worth $100,000, but does not currently have a mortgage on it, they may take an equity loan at 80% loan to value (LTV) or $80,000 in cash in exchange for a mortgage on the title. Many lending institutions require the borrower to repay only an interest component of the loan each month (calculated daily, and compounded to the loan once each month). The borrower can apply any surplus funds to the outstanding loan principal at any time, reducing the amount of interest calculated from that day onward. Some loan products also allow the possibility to redraw cash up to the original LTV, potentially perpetuating the life of the loan beyond the original loan term. The interest rate applied to equity loans is much lower than that applied to unsecured loans, such as credit card debt. The reasoning behind this is that equity loans involve collateral, and credit card debt does not.

The National Park Reserve was set aside in 1972 to become a national park, pending settlement of Native American land claims. It covered an area of . When agreement was reached with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations over an eastern portion of the Reserve, that part—about —became a national park in 1993, and is a unit of the national park system administered co-operatively with Parks Canada. The larger western section remains a Reserve, awaiting a final land claim settlement with the Kluane First Nation. The park borders B.C. to the south, while the Reserve borders both B.C. to the south, and the United States (Alaska) to the south and west. The Reserve includes the highest mountain in Canada, Mount Logan () of the Saint Elias Mountains. Mountains and glaciers dominate the park's landscape, covering 83% of its area. The rest of the land in the park is forest and tundra—east of the largest mountains and glaciers—where the climate is colder and drier than in the western and southern parts of the park. Trees grow only at the park's lowest elevations. The primary tree species are white spruce, balsam poplar and trembling aspen. Activities A day-use area with boat launch, picnic facilities and campground is located at Kathleen Lake, and is operated from mid-May to mid-September. Hiking is a popular activity on trails such as St. Elias Lake, Mush Lake Road, Shorty Creek, Cottonwood, Rock Glacier, King's Throne, Kokanee, Auriol, Dezadeash River Trail, Alsek Trail, Sheep Creek Trail, Bullion Plateau Trail, Slims West or Soldiers Summit. Rafting on the Alsek River (a Canadian Heritage river), mountain biking on old mining roads, horseback riding through the Alsek Pass, boating on Kathleen Lake and Mush Lake as well as fishing for lake trout, Arctic grayling, rainbow trout, northern pike and sockeye salmon are also among activities available in the park. The park was the subject of a short film in 2011's National Parks Project, directed by Louise Archambault and scored by Graham Van Pelt, Ian D'Sa and Mishka Stein. In August 2013, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. visited the park to see Mount Kennedy, named as a memorial to his uncle, U. S. president John F. Kennedy.Speakers' Spotlight – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Journeys To The Yukon To Visit Mount Kennedy. Speakers.ca. Retrieved 2013-09-27. Fauna Mammalian species that inhabit this park include Yukon wolf, bear, coyote, mink, lynx, river otter, caribou, Yukon moose, muskrat, snowshoe hare, marmot, red fox, Dall sheep, beaver, wolverine, mountain goat, and arctic ground squirrel. This park contains about 120 species of birds, including the rock ptarmigan and the golden and bald eagles. =World Heritage Site= The bi-national Kluane- Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek park system comprising Kluane, Wrangell-St Elias, Glacier Bay and Tatshenshini-Alsek parks, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 for the spectacular glacier and icefield landscapes as well as for the importance of grizzly bears, caribou and Dall sheep habitat. In a 2009 census of the Kluane herd, there were 181 northern mountain caribou, a distinct ecotype of caribou. =First Nations presence= Kluane National Park lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and Kluane First Nation who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

History The band was formed soon after Murphy and Karn left their former bands (Bauhaus and Japan, respectively). They took their name from a Captain Beefheart song from his album Trout Mask Replica. =The Waking Hour= Initially, the band recorded one album, The Waking Hour (UK No. 84), and released one single, \\"The Judgement Is the Mirror\\" (UK No. 66). The cover of the album features a detail from Maxfield Parrish's seminal painting Daybreak. The recording of the album took place in unusual circumstances, as neither Karn nor Murphy spent much time together in the recording studio, preferring to send tapes back and forth between each other, to work on alone. Much of the video to the single was recorded on location in Malta.Murphy speaking on Channel 4's The Tube, TX 23/11/1984 =Reunion and subsequent releases= In August 2010, Peter Murphy announced on Twitter that he and Karn were planning to head into the studio in September to begin work on the second Dali's Car album. The project was cut short, however, as Karn had recently been diagnosed with cancer. He died on 4 January 2011, thus ending the reunion.Meikle, James (2011) \\"Former Japan bass player Mick Karn loses battle with cancer\\", \\"The Guardian\\", 5 January 2011, retrieved 5 January 2011 The tracks they did record—including a re-working of Artemis from The Waking Hour with newly added vocals, guitar, and drums, and renamed Artemis Rise—were released on 5 April 2012 as an EP entitled InGladAloneness. The tracks were mixed by Steve Jansen, mastered by Pieter Snapper in Istanbul and the artwork for the EP was created by Murphy with Thomas Bak with a painting by Jarosław Kukowski. The Japanese version of the EP contains a memorial photo booklet with photos by Steve Jansen along with comments from fellow artists who have collaborated with Mick. Artemis Rise was made available as a download through the Burning Shed MK Music store on Sunday 24 July, to commemorate what would have been Karn's 53rd birthday. The song is an updated version of the song as it appeared on The Waking Hour, with added vocals by Murphy, drums by Jansen, and guitar by Jakszyk.

It is a mixed-use historic district, known for its nightlife, and serves as an example of success in urban reinvestment and revitalization. The current population is approximately 21,145. History Prior to European exploration of the area, Native Americans, particularly the Arapaho tribe, established encampments along the South Platte River near or in what is now LoDo. In 1858, after the discovery of gold in the river, General William Larimer founded Denver by putting down cottonwood logs in the center of a square mile plot that would eventually be the current LoDo neighborhood, making LoDo both the original city of Denver, as well as its oldest neighborhood. Then, like now, LoDo was a bustling and sometimes wild area known for its saloons and brothels. During the Sand Creek Massacre, it was LoDo where the heads of the slaughtered Arapaho tribe were paraded in victory. As Denver grew, city leaders realized a railroad was needed to keep Denver a strong city, especially when the transcontinental railroad bypassed Denver for Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 1870, after much cajoling from town leaders, residents passed bonds that brought a rail spur from Cheyenne. This and later train lines ended up in the Central Platte Valley, adjacent to LoDo. Union Station became the place most people traveled into the city and LoDo would be the first part of the city they would see. This section eventually became Denver's Chinatown from the 1870s to the 1880s, only to be torn down by race riots. By the mid- twentieth century, what was once a thriving business area had become a skid row. As highways and airports diminished the dominance of passenger railroad transportation, the importance of Union Station, LoDo's most prominent building, waned. Wazee St in LoDo The Lower Downtown Historic District, known as LoDo, was created by the enactment of a zoning ordinance by Denver City Council in March 1988. The resolution's intent was to encourage historic preservation and to promote economic and social vitality in Denver's founding neighborhood at a time when it still held significant historic and architectural value.LoDo District, Inc. a membership organization in Lower Downtown Denver with historical, cultural, retail & entertainment - LoDo District The status granted by this special designation provided protection to the community's archivable resources and to the 127 contributing historic structures that remained after roughly 20% of Lower Downtown's buildings had been demolished through DURA policies in the 1960s and 1970s. LoDo's historic district ordinance includes zoning that restricts building height and encourages mixed-use development. It stipulates strict design guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction.Denver Office of the Clerk and Recorder  DenverGov.org These guidelines have been challenged by out-of-state developers but are vigorously defended by residents. During this time, the neighborhood began its renaissance and new businesses opened. Gradually LoDo became a destination neighborhood. By the time Coors Field opened on the edge of the LoDo Historic District in 1995, the area had revitalized itself, becoming a new, hip neighborhood filled with clubs, restaurants, art galleries, boutiques, bars, and other businesses. Pepsi Center, located on the other edge of the neighborhood, opened in 1999 and further established the neighborhood as a sport fan's paradise. New residential development came to LoDo, transforming old warehouses into pricey new lofts. . City of Denver.

The B-7 zoned historic district is roughly bordered by: *Cherry Creek/Speer Boulevard *Wewatta Street (excluding Union Station) *20th Street *The alley between Market and Larimer Streets When referring to the greater LoDo area, people often include adjacent neighborhoods that are not a part of the official historic district, but encompass LoDo's sphere of influence. This unofficial greater area includes Larimer Square, the Auraria Campus, Riverfront Park, the Central Platte Valley, the Prospect district, River North, and the Ballpark neighborhoods. LoDo is located in north central Denver, directly northwest of the downtown CBD, near the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River. Economy The Wynkoop Brewing Company, located on 18th Street in LoDo Land in the Lower Downtown Historic District is zoned B-7, which includes building height limitations and encourages mixed-use development and provides strict design guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction. Projects must go through an architectural design review, which allows LoDo to retain its pedestrian scale and historic character as it continues to densify. The average cost of a home in LoDo in May of 2016 was $701,286. Oxford Hotel The Oxford Hotel, built in 1891, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Wynkoop Brewing Company The Wynkoop Brewing Company, a brewpub founded in 1988 by Colorado's 42nd Governor John Hickenlooper with partners Russell Schehrer, Mark Schiffler, and Jerry Williams, sponsors the \\"Beerdrinker of the Year\\" competition, which is hosted yearly in one of the banquet halls. The Wynkoop has a large billiards hall on its top floor. Arts and culture In the summer of 2006, LoDo hosted the cast members of MTV's popular reality show The Real World, as season 18: The Real World: Denver. Several movies have also been filmed, wholly or in part, in the neighborhood, including the Eddie Murphy film Imagine That (2009). LoDo's combination of contemporary architecture sprinkled among historic buildings, beautiful mountain views, access to Cherry Creek and nearby parks, plus its proximity to two major sporting venues, make it an attractive location for television and movie filming. The 70+ bars and restaurants in the historic district provide a positive economic impact for the city.

The band has released five full-length albums, two EPs and two DVDs depicting their performances at Wacken Open Air (in 2005) and Bloodstock Open Air (in 2010). The group comprises Martin Axenrot (Opeth), Anders Nyström (Katatonia), Jonas Renkse (Katatonia) and Nick Holmes (Paradise Lost). History The band named themselves after the song \\"Blood Bath\\" from the album To the Gory End by Cancer. A year after being formed, the band, then consisting of Mikael Åkerfeldt (Opeth) on vocals, Dan Swanö (Edge of Sanity, Nightingale, etc.) on drums, Anders \\"Blakkheim\\" Nyström (Katatonia, Diabolical Masquerade) on guitar, and Jonas Renkse (Katatonia, October Tide) on bass, released their EP Breeding Death, followed two years later by their debut album Resurrection Through Carnage. In 2004, Åkerfeldt left Bloodbath to free up more time for his primary band Opeth. To replace him, Bloodbath brought in Peter Tägtgren (Hypocrisy). The lineup changed further, with Swanö switching to play the guitar instead of drums. Martin Axenrot (Witchery, Satanic Slaughter, Opeth) took his place and the band was now bigger and more serious, no longer just a secondary project. The band's second full release, Nightmares Made Flesh, was released in Europe in September 2004. In February 2005, Tägtgren left the band due to \\"conflicting schedules\\". That same year, Åkerfeldt rejoined the band for a single live show at Germany's Wacken Open Air on August 5. Prior to the show, the band commented on the Wacken show: \\"Not only the first, but also the last gig for Bloodbath (with Mikael Åkerfeldt on vocals)\\"; later it also turned out to be the last one with Swanö. In September 2005, Bloodbath started searching for a new lead singer. In August 2006, the band announced the departure of Swanö from their ranks due to musical differences, as well as Swanö being busy with other projects. They simultaneously closed the vocal auditions, announcing that no suitable singer had been found. On March 27, 2007, the band announced that a new line-up would shortly be unveiled, along with news that they were producing new material, to be released on a mini-CD towards the end of summer. In August 2007, Renkse wrote a message on the band's official discussion forum which suggested that work was in progress. On January 30, 2008, it was announced via the Bloodbath website that Åkerfeldt would be rejoining the line-up on vocals, along with new member Per Eriksson (ex-21 Lucifers, ex-Genocrush Ferox) on guitar. In March 2008, the EP Unblessing the Purity was released. Also released in 2008 was the Wacken live CD/DVD The Wacken Carnage. Bloodbath released their third full-length album, The Fathomless Mastery, in October 2008. On April 25, 2011, Bloodbath released their second DVD, Bloodbath over Bloodstock, which contains their performance at Bloodstock Festival 2010, as well as their 2008 performance at Party San. On November 1, 2011, during the final show of the American Opeth/Katatonia tour at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, MD, Bloodbath performed a surprise encore after Opeth's set. On April 14, 2012, Blakkheim announced that Åkerfeldt officially left the group. Blakkheim has said in multiple interviews that they have a new vocalist set, but they cannot reveal the identity at the moment due to the lack of contract. When asked in one interview whether the new vocalist was known or not, Blakkheim said, \\"Oh, he's a legend!\\". On September 16, 2014, the band announced the new Bloodbath vocalist as Nick Holmes from Paradise Lost.

The electrical current is used to either create an opposing magnetic field, or to charge a field, which can then be repelled. When a current flows through a conductor in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic force known as a Lorentz force, pushes the conductor in a direction perpendicular to the conductor and the magnetic field. This repulsing force is what causes propulsion in a system designed to take advantage of the phenomenon. The term electromagnetic propulsion (EMP) can be described by its individual components: electromagneticusing electricity to create a magnetic field, and propulsionthe process of propelling something. When a fluid (liquid or gas) is employed as the moving conductor, the propulsion may be termed magnetohydrodynamic drive. One key difference between EMP and propulsion achieved by electric motors is that the electrical energy used for EMP is not used to produce rotational energy for motion; though both use magnetic fields and a flowing electrical current. The science of electromagnetic propulsion does not have origins with any one individual and has application in many different fields. The thought of using magnets for propulsion continues to this day and has been dreamed of since at least 1897 when John Munro published his fictional story \\"A Trip to Venus\\". Current applications can be seen in maglev trains and military railguns. Other applications that remain not widely used or still in development include ion thruster for low orbiting satellites and magnetohydrodynamic drive for ships and submarines. History One of the first recorded discoveries regarding electromagnetic propulsion was in 1889 when Professor Elihu Thomson made public his work with electromagnetic waves and alternating currents.Harding, R, & Darroch, D. (2003, May). Emile bachelet collection. Retrieved from A few years later Emile Bachelet proposed the idea of a metal carriage levitated in air above the rails in a modern railway, which he showcased in the early 1890s. In the 1960s Eric Roberts Laithwaite developed the linear induction motor, which built upon these principles and introduced the first practical application of electromagnetic propulsion.James R. Powell ph.d. (2002). Retrieved from In 1966 James R. Powell and Gordon Danby patented the superconducting maglev transportation system, and after this engineers around the world raced to create the first high-speed rail. From 1984 to 1995 the first commercial automated maglev system ran in Birmingham. It was a low speed Maglev shuttle that ran from the Birmingham International Airport to the Birmingham International Railway System. In the USSR at the beginning of 1960th at the Institute of Hydrodynamics, Novosibirsk, Russia, prof. V.F. Minin laid down the experimental foundations of electromagnetic accelerating of bodies to hypersonic velocity. Uses= Trains = SCMaglev on the Yamanashi test track in Japan in November 2005 Electromagnetic propulsion is utilized in transportation systems to minimize friction and maximize speed over long distances. This has mainly been implemented in high-speed rail systems that use a linear induction motor to power trains by magnetic currents. It has also been utilized in theme parks to create high-speed roller coasters and water rides. Maglev In a maglev train the primary coil assembly lies below the reaction plate. There is a 1–10 cm (0.39-3.93 inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for speeds up to 500 km/h (310 mph). An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field. This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back. A typical Maglev train costs three cents per passenger mile, or seven cents per ton mile (not including construction costs). This compares to 15 cents per passenger miles for travel by plane and 30 cents for ton mile for travel by intercity trucks. Maglev tracks have high longevity due to minimal friction and an even distribution of weight. Most last for at least 50 years and require little maintenance during this time. Maglev trains are promoted for their energy efficiency since they run on electricity, which can be produced by coal, nuclear, hydro, fusion, wind or solar power without requiring oil. On average most trains travel 483 km/h (300 mph) and use 0.4 megajoules per passenger mile. Using a 20 mi/gallon car with 1.8 people as a comparison, travel by car is typically 97 km/h (60 mph) and uses 4 megajoules per passenger mile. The carbon dioxide emissions are based upon the method of electrical production and fuel use. Many renewable electrical production methods generate little or no carbon dioxide during production (although carbon dioxide may be released during manufacture of the components, e.g. the steel used in wind turbines). The running of the train is significantly quieter than other trains, trucks or airplanes. Assembly: Linear Induction Motor A linear induction motor consists of two parts: the primary coil assembly and the reaction plate.Gluckman, R. (n.d.). Is it a Bird? a plane?. Retrieved from gluckman.comLmac - ac linear induction motor. (2010). Retrieved from The primary coil assembly consists of phase windings surrounded by steel laminations, and includes a thermal sensor within a thermal epoxy. The reaction plate consists of a 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) thick aluminum or copper plate bonded to a 6.4 mm (0.25 inch) thick cold rolled steel sheet. There is an air gap between these two parts that creates the frictionless property an electromagnetic propulsion system encompasses. Functioning of a linear induction motor begins with an AC force that is supplied to the coil windings within the primary coil assembly. This creates a traveling magnetic field that induces a current in the reaction plate, which then creates its own magnetic field. The magnetic fields in the primary coil assembly and reaction plate alternate, which generates force and direct linear motion. = Spacecraft = There are multiple applications for EMP technologies in the field of aerospace. Many of these applications are conceptual as of now, however, there are also several applications that range from near term to next century.Byers, D. C. (1984). The NASA electric propulsion program. JSASS/AIAA/DGLR 17th International Electric Propulsion Conference, 1-9. One of such applications is the use of EMP to control fine adjustments of orbiting satellites. One of these particular systems is based on the direct interactions of the vehicle's own electromagnetic field and the magnetic field of the Earth. The thrust force may be thought of as an electrodynamic force of interaction of the electric current inside its conductors with the applied natural field of the Earth. To attain a greater force of interaction, the magnetic field must be propagated further from the flight craft. The advantages of such systems is the very precise and instantaneous control over the thrust force. In addition, the expected electrical efficiencies are far greater than those of current chemical rockets that attain propulsion through the intermediate use of heat; this results in low efficiencies and large amounts of gaseous pollutants. The electrical energy in the coil of the EMP system is translated to potential and kinetic energy through direct energy conversion. This results in the system having the same high efficiencies as other electrical machines while excluding the ejection of any substance into the environment. The current thrust-to mass ratios of these systems are relatively low. Nevertheless, since they do not require reaction mass, the vehicle mass is constant. Also, the thrust can be continuous with relatively low electric consumption. The biggest limitation would be mainly the electrical conductance of materials to produce the necessary values of the current in the propulsion system. = Ships and Submarines = EMP and its applications for seagoing ships and submarines have been investigated since at least 1958 when Warren Rice filed a patent explaining the technology .Rice, W.A. (1961). U.S. Patent No. 2997013. Washington DC: US Patent and Trademark Office. The technology described by Rice considered charging the hull of the vessel itself. The design was later refined by allowing the water to flow through thrusters as described in a later patent by James Meng .Meng, J.C.S. (1994). U.S. Patent No. 5333444. Washington DC: US Patent and Trademark Office. The arrangement consists of a water channel open at both ends extending longitudinally through or attached to the ship, a means for producing magnetic field throughout the water channel, electrodes at each side of the channel and source of power to send direct current through the channel at right angles to magnetic flux in accordance with Lorentz force.Friauf, J. B. (1961). Electromagnetic ship propulsion. American Society of Naval Engineers  Journal, 73(1), 139-142. =Elevators= Cable-free elevators using EMP, capable of moving both vertically and horizontally, have been developed by German engineering firm Thyssen Krupp for use in high rise, high density buildings.

The orange-billed babbler is a resident breeding bird endemic to Sri Lanka. In the past, it was considered to be a race of jungle babbler, Argya striatus. Its habitat is rainforest, and it is seldom seen away from deep jungle. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. Although its habitat is under threat, it occurs in all the forests of the wet zone, and is quite common at prime sites like Kitulgala and Sinharaja. It builds its nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three deep greenish blue eggs. These birds are plain orange brown below, and have a slightly darker shade above. The crown and nape are grey, and the bill is orange. The orange-billed babbler lives in flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. It is usually the first sign that a mixed-species feeding flock, so characteristic of Asian wet forests, is in the vicinity. It feeds mainly on insects, but also eats jungle berries. Taxonomy The orange-billed babbler was formerly placed in the genus Turdoides but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus Argya. In culture In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as rathu demalichcha (translates to 'red babbler') in Sinhala language. This bird appears in a 10 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.http://www.birdtheme.org/country/srilanka.html Also this bird appears in 100 Sri Lankan rupee bank note (2010 series).

Johnson and originally recorded by the a cappella gospel group the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet (of which Johnson was a member) in 1943. Robert Wyatt recorded a cover of the song in 1980. Background \\"Stalin Wasn't Stallin was written during World War II, and praises the efforts of Joseph Stalin in his stand against Adolf Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt had declared in a 28 July 1943 speech that: The United States and the Soviet Union were co-belligerents during the war and many decisive battles occurred between the Soviets and Germany that changed the direction of the war. Original recording The Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet spoke (or sermonized) the lyrics of the song against a rhythm of back-up vocals. It was a moderate hit in 1943. It has since appeared on several compilation records, including Gospel Greats: 60 Legendary Performances (The Soho Collection, 2005). Covers Robert Wyatt covered the song in 1980, emulating an a cappella group by singing in four- part harmony (achieved by multi-tracking). Wyatt's interest in the song was that he wanted to remind the West of the selective memory they had during the Cold War about this earlier alliance. The cover was released as a single in 1981 with \\"Stalingrad\\", a poem about the Battle of Stalingrad, written and read by Peter Blackman, on the \\"B\\" side. \\"Stalin Wasn't Stallin and \\"Stalingrad\\" also appeared on Wyatt's 1982 album Nothing Can Stop Us.

His distinctive fretless bass sound and melodic playing style were a trademark of the band's sound. Early life Karn was born Andonis Michaelides in Nicosia on 24 July 1958. When he was three, his Greek-Cypriot parents moved with him to London, where he was raised. In his youth he began playing mouth organ at the age of seven and violin at the age of eleven, before he took up playing bassoon for the school orchestra. As a bassoon player he performed with London School Symphony Orchestra in a concert in October 1972 which was broadcast by Radio 4. However, when his bassoon was stolen and his school refused to buy him a new one he bought a bass guitar for £5 from a school friend. At school he became friends with David Sylvian and his younger brother Steve. As an escape from their south London environment they began to play music together and in June 1974 they made their first public performance.Biography Mick Karn.net Career=Japan= Japan in Toronto, 24 November 1979 Initially with Karn as lead vocalist they christened themselves Japan in 1974. Joined by keyboardist Richard Barbieri and guitarist Rob Dean the following year, they signed a recording contract with German disco label Hansa in 1977, with whom they recorded three studio albums and became an alternative glam rock outfit in the mould of David Bowie, T.Rex, and The New York Dolls. They switched to Virgin Records to record their subsequent albums Gentlemen Take Polaroids and Tin Drum. As the band started to achieve commercial success with the release of Tin Drum, and \\"Ghosts\\", which reached the top five in 1982, tensions and personality conflicts between band members rose; Tin Drum was to be the band's final studio album. Long-simmering differences among the bandmembers came to a head when Karn's girlfriend, photographer Yuka Fujii, moved in with Sylvian and the individual members forged ahead with their own projects.Also in the office that day was David Sylvian's former partner, Yuka Fujii. Once a girlfriend of Mick Karn, who now lives in Cyprus, Fujii had contributed to the unease within the band by leaving Karn for Sylvian. 'Being in the middle of all that was very difficult,' says Jansen. 'The tension back stage on tour was unbelievable. Mick has quite an ego on him. In those days he was very headstrong about what he wanted to do. He started to make plans for a solo album during the recording of Tin Drum, and Dave wasn't happy about that. And the girlfriend problem set it right off between them. Mick never really got over those issues. I don't think you can.' Karn said in an interview that as tensions with their record company had abated following Japan's commercial success, band members began focusing on personal differences rather than on the common enemy.Anil Prasad interview – 'How did becoming so successful so young affect you?' =Session work and solo projects= Karn played bass guitar and saxophone on Gary Numan's 1981 No.6 hit \\"She's Got Claws\\" and tracks on the song's parent No.3 hit album, Dance. In November 1982, Karn released his first solo album, Titles, just as Japan had announced their split. In 1982 Karn wrote some material with Michael Finbarr Murphy guitarist and writer for Heatwave, Alan Murphy of Level 42, and Diana Ross among others. They did some low key gigs around London during the summer of 1982, and then went their separate ways. In 1983, he collaborated with Midge Ure on the UK top 40 single \\"After a Fashion\\", and in 1984, he formed Dalis Car with Peter Murphy. The duo released one album, The Waking Hour, in late 1984. In the 1990s he worked with artist David Torn, Andy Rinehart and a number of Japanese musicians, and formed the multinational new wave band, NiNa. Latterly, he worked as a solo artist. Karn contributed to recordings by other artists, playing bass guitar on Bill Nelson's Chimera mini-LP, bass guitar and saxophone on Gary Numan's 1981 album Dance, and also played with Kate Bush and Joan Armatrading. In the 1990s he started the Medium Productions label along with Steve Jansen and Richard Barbieri, two of his fellow former Japan-members. and Debi Zornes (label management and artist co-ordination). In 2006, the MK Music imprint was established, by Karn, Debi Zornes and Mike Trenery — and beginning with 2006's Three Part Species, all releases, including the autobiography, have the MK Music logo on them. In 2001, Karn began to work with Gota Yashiki, Vivian Hsu, Masahide Sakuma, and Masami Tsuchiya in the band The d.e.p., or doggy eels project.Martin, Ian (16 July 2010). \\"Former band members unite to help cancer- stricken Karn\\", The Japan Times In 2001, he worked with Paul Wong on his \\"Yellow Paul Wong\\" release. Karn left London in 2004 to live in Cyprus with his wife and son, financially enabling himself to keep working as a musician/artist. In 2009, Karn also released his autobiography, titled Japan & Self Existence, available through his website and Lulu, which details his music career, his interests in sculpture and painting, his childhood, relationships, and family. On 30 August 2010, Peter Murphy disclosed via video message (subsequently removed/hidden) on his personal Facebook profile that he would be reuniting with Karn for a week in London, perhaps in November, to begin writing and recording for a second Dalis Car album. Murphy also added that this would be the first time the two had seen each other since 1983.\\"Video message from Pete Murphy on his FB page\\". The project was cut short, however, as Karn had recently been diagnosed with cancer. After his death, five of the tracks they did record were released on 5 April 2012 as an EP entitled InGladAloneness. The tracks were mixed by Steve Jansen, mastered by Pieter Snaper in Istanbul and the artwork for the EP was created by Thomas Bak with a painting by Jarosław Kukowski. Musical style Karn was essentially a self-taught musician, stating, \\"I rely very much on my ears. If it sounds as if it's the right thing, then I'll keep it—even if it may not be.\\"Anil Prasad interview (1996) – 'You don't read music. How does that affect your ability to communicate with fellow musicians?' His first musical instrument was bassoon, with which he attended and passed an LSSO audition. After his bassoon was stolen from him, he purchased a bass guitar for £5. It was then he joined up with David Batt (Sylvian), who played acoustic guitar.Gray, Louise (April 1994). \\"Karnal knowledge\\", The Wire 122, Karn was principally the bassist within Japan, but also played all the wind instruments, including the saxophone; on Tin Drum, he played the Chinese suona (credited as \\"dida\\") for the authentic oriental sound. Karn's use of the fretless bass guitar, a relatively unusual instrument in modern popular music, produces a distinctive sound and playing style, which makes his playing immediately recognisable.Hayes, Kelvin \\"[ Mick Karn Biography]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 5 February 2010 Karn played an aluminium-neck Travis Bean bass on all Japan albums up to Gentlemen Take Polaroids. In 1981 he moved to Wal basses, purchasing two Mark I instruments, one with rare African tulipwood facings, the other a cherry solidbody. Karn recorded Japan's last studio album Tin Drum with the Wal and had continued to use these, along with a headless Klein K Bass. Sculpture and painting Karn was a self-taught sculptor working in mainly clay although he explored other mediums. He held several exhibitions. He also painted in oils and experimented with using ceramic on the canvas to create a 3D effect. He was photographed in the early 1980s by Steve Jansen. Several of his paintings were used as sleeve covers for his music including, \\"Buoy\\" and \\"The Concrete Twin\\". His sculpture \\"Mask of Confidence\\", combining his hands with the arms, upper torso and face of photographer Yuka Fujii, was used as the inner sleeve cover for Kajagoogoo's Islands album. Karn, influenced by Chinese edible folk sculpture dating back thousands of years, also experimented in designing and creating edible life size portraiture, some of which were showcased at his restaurant \\"The Penguin Cafe\\". Karn said, \\"There was a definite change in style when I stopped using self-hardening clay in the mid '80s and began sculpting with more conventional clay. Finding it much more malleable, the pieces could be worked on a larger scale and needn't be focused, as was the case previously, on small detail.\\" He continued to sculpt throughout his life and eventually learned to fire his own pieces. Personal life Karn had two diplomas in psychotherapy from a West London college, entitling him to call himself \\"Member of the Associated Stress Consultants, Psychotherapy, and Regression & Hypno-analysis\\".Japan & Self Existence, Karn, Mick (2009) page 281 Illness and death In June 2010, Karn announced on his website that he had been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, though the specific type of cancer was not mentioned. According to David Torn, Karn's cancer had apparently already spread and he was undergoing chemotherapy.Larkin, Adrian (11 June 2010). Midge Ure's fundraiser BBC6 The website announcement stated that Karn had been struggling financially for some time, and appealed for donations to help pay for his medical care and provide financial assistance for his family. In addition, several people Karn had worked with, in particular Midge Ure, Porcupine Tree,MickKarn.net, retrieved 27 September 2010 and Masami Tsuchiya, announced concerts in support of the appeal. According to a website update dated 3 September 2010, the funds raised by the appeal enabled Karn and his family to move back to London, where Karn received treatment. However, the cancer had spread beyond the possibility of treatment, and he died at his home in London on 4 January 2011.Strong, Martin C.

It was announced by IBM on the last day of 1964, and it was first delivered in June 1966.E.W. Pugh, L.R. Johnson, and John H. Palmer, IBM's 360 and early 370 systems, MIT Press, Cambridge MA and London, - extensive (819 pp.) treatment of IBM's offerings during this period In its time, DOS/360 was the most widely used operating system in the world.Pugh, op. cit., p. 331 - most widely used OS DOS versions=TOS/360= TOS/360 (Tape Operating System/360, not a DOS as such and not so called) was an IBM operating system for the System/360, used in the early days around 1965 to support the System/360 Model 30 and similar platforms. TOS, as per the \\"Tape\\" in the name, required a tape drive. It shared most of the code base and some manuals with IBM's DOS/360. TOS went through 14 releases, and was discontinued when disks such as the IBM 2311 and IBM 2314 became more affordable at the time of System/360, whereas they had been an expensive luxury on the IBM 7090. =DOS/360= DOS/360 was the primary operating system for most small to midsize S/360 installations. =DOS/VS= DOS/VS was released in 1972. The first DOS/VS release was numbered \\"Release 28\\" to signify an incremental upgrade from DOS/360. It added virtual memory in support of the new System/370 series hardware. It used a fixed page table which mapped a single address space of up to 16 megabytes for all partitions combined. DOS/VS increased the number of partitions (separate simultaneous programs) from three (named Background, Foreground 1 and Foreground 2) to five (BG and F1 through F4) and allowed a system wide total of fifteen subtasks.GC33-5370-2 DOS/VS was succeeded by DOS/VSE through z/VSE. =DOS/VSE= DOS/VSE was introduced in 1979 as an \\"extended\\" version of DOS/VS to support the new 4300 processors. The 4300 systems included a feature called ECPS:VSE that provided a single-level storage for both the processor and the I/O channels. DOS/VSE provided support for ECPS:VSE, but could also run on a System/370 without that feature. VSE was the last free version of DOS. =SSX/VSE= SSX/VSE (\\"Small System Executive\\") was an attempt by IBM to simplify purchase and installation of VSE by providing a pre-generated system containing the OS and the most popular products. SSX was released in 1982, and later replaced by VSE/SP. SSX was sold by IBM as a bundle of 14 component products (Advanced Functions/VSE, VSE/POWER, ACF/VTAME, VSE/VSAM, CICS/DOS/VS, DOS/VS, Sort/Merge, VSE/ICCF, VSE/OCCF, VSE/IPCS, DOS/COBOL, Back Up/Restore, Space Management, VSE/DITTO), and originally would only agree to offer the individual products separately via RPQ, although IBM later agreed to add those products individually to its price list under pressure from ISVs who claimed that the bundling violated antitrust laws. =VSE/SP= In 1986 IBM released VSE/SP (\\"System Product\\") in conjunction with the announcement of the 9370 processors. VSE/SP replaced SSX/VSE and bundled VSE with the most popular VSE program products such as VSE/AF, ACF/VTAM, CICS, and POWER/VS. VSE/SP supported only 24-bit addresses, despite customer requests to provide an XA (31 bit) version. =VSE/ESA= VSE/ESA was a 31-bit DOS/VSE version, which was released in 1990 with support for up to 384 MB of real storage. It provided up to twelve static partitions and allowed VSE/POWER and ACF/VTAM to be run in private address spaces. It introduced a new feature called dynamic partitions which could allow up to 150 concurrent jobs, each in its own address space. Version 1 could run in either ESA or 370 mode, with the ESA mode also supporting XA hardware with limitations. Version 2 only supported ESA mode with ESA hardware. =z/VSE= IBM released z/VSE 3.1 in 2005. This change in naming reflected the new \\"System z\\" branding for IBM's mainframe product line, but did not represent a fundamental change in architecture from VSE/ESA 2.7 which preceded it. In particular, it did not support the new 64-bit z/Architecture, running only in 31-bit mode even on 64-bit capable machines. z/VSE 4.1 released in 2007 introduced support for 64-bit real addressing, with up to 8 GB of memory. However, while parts of the supervisor run in 64-bit mode, it only provides 31-bit virtual address spaces to problem state applications. As of 2011 one estimate placed the number of sites using z/VSE at around 4000. History  When developing a new hardware generation of unified System/360 (or S/360) computers, IBM had originally committed to delivering a single operating system, OS/360, also compatible with low-end machines; but hardware was already available and the OS/360 project fell further and further behind schedule, as described at length by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. IBM was forced to quickly develop four additional systems: * BPS/360 for machines with at least 8 KB of core memory and a punched card reader, * BOS/360 for machines with at least 8 KB memory and a disk drive, * DOS/360 for machines with at least 16 KB memory and a disk drive, * TOS/360 for machines with at least 16 KB memory and a tape drive.DOS/360 and TOS/360 had the same code base; the difference was whether it used disk libraries or tape libraries. When OS/360 was finally released, a year late, it required at least 64 KB of memory. DOS was designed to use little memory, and could run on 16 KB machines, a configuration available on the low-end S/360 model 30. Unlike OS/360, DOS/360 was initially a single-job system which did not support multitasking. A version with multitasking, supporting up to three memory partitions, requiring 32 KB of memory was later released. Despite its limitations, DOS/360 became the most widely used operating system for processors with less than 256 KB of memory because: System/360 hardware sold very well; DOS/360 ran well on System/360 processors which medium-sized organizations could afford; and it was better than the \\"operating systems\\" these customers had before. DOS/360 was the operating system which filled the time gap between the announcement of the System/360 and the availability of the intended operating system, OS/360. As a result of the delay, a number of customers implemented DOS systems and committed significant investments to run them. IBM expected that DOS/360 users would soon upgrade to OS/360, but as a result of those investments, they were reluctant to commit to such conversion. IBM then needed to continue to offer DOS/360 as an additional operating system. The Hacker's Jargon File incorrectly states that GECOS (also known as GCOS) was copied from DOS/360, which was not the case, however the Xerox Data Systems Xerox Operating System (XOS) was intentionally similar to DOS to simplify program porting. Hardware requirements IBM 2311 disk drive DOS/360 required a System/360 CPU (model 25 and above) with the standard instruction set (decimal and floating-point instruction sets optional). The minimum memory requirement was 16 KB; storage protection was required only if multiprogramming was used. A 1052 Model 7DOS/360 on a S/370 used a 3210 or a 3215 rather than a 1052-7 printer-keyboard, either a selector or multiplexor channel, and at least one disk drive was required — initially a 2311 holding 7.25 MB. A card reader, card punch and line printer were usually included, but magnetic tape drives could be substituted. A typical configuration might consist of a S/360 model 30 with 32KB memory and the decimal instruction set, an IBM 2540 card reader/card punch, an IBM 1403 printer, two or three IBM 2311 disks, two IBM 2415 magnetic tape drives, and the 1052-7 console. Technical details The following description applies to DOS/360 except as otherwise noted. Later versions offer additional functionality. Because DOS/360 was designed to run on low-end models of System/360 memory usage was a concern. It was possible to generate a DOS supervisor, the resident portion of the operating system, as small as 5902 bytes. Detailed charts listed memory requirements for each sysgen option, often as little as 100 bytes. A minimum system would leave just over 10 KB of storage available for a single batch partition which was enough to run utilities and all compilers except COBOL, PL/I, and full FORTRAN IV. To keep memory usage as small as possible, DOS was coded entirely in assembly language. =Transients= The concept of transient area is part of Mythical Man-Month's discussion on design and the use of main memory. To further reduce memory usage, the supervisor employed overlays called transients that were read into one of two reserved transient areas as required. * Physical transients were loaded into the 556 byte A-Transient area to handle hardware errors (ERPs), record error-specific data (OBR/MDR) on IJSYSRC, and issue error messages. All A-Transient module names began with $$A. * Logical transients were loaded into the 1200 byte B-Transient area to provided common program services like OPEN and CLOSE for LIOCS. All B-Transient module names began with $$B. The use of $$A and $$B prefixes ensured rapid loading of transients because their names were stored first in the directory. DOS/VS added Machine Check and Channel Check Handlers, which were another set of transients all starting with $$RAST and executing in the Recovery Transient area. This was done as part of the reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) enhancements for the System/370. Before this addition, machine checks caused termination of the program running and channel checks caused termination of the program accessing the device, at the time of the error. =Multiprogramming= Like all System/360 operating software initial releases of DOS could run only one program at a time. Later versions of \\"real\\" DOS were able to run up to three programs concurrently, in separate memory partitions, supported by the same hardware memory protection features of the more scalable OS/360 operating system. These were identified as BG (background), F1 (foreground 1) and F2 (foreground 2). Multiprogramming was an optional feature of DOS/360, selectable at system generation. Another SYSGEN option allowed batch operation run in either FG partition. Otherwise foreground programs had to be manually started by the computer operator. DOS/VS allowed up to seven concurrent programs, although five or six was a more common number due to the smaller scale of the hardware usually hosting DOS systems. Both DOS and DOS/VS allow the number of partitions to be set at IPL (Initial Program Load), the IBM term for Boot load. =Program libraries= Executable programs were stored in a Core Image Library. While running, DOS could not reclaim space as programs were deleted or replaced with newer versions. When the Core Image Library became full, it had to be compressed by one of the utility programs, and this could halt development work for as much as half a day. Many shops simply froze changes for a day, compressed the CIL \\"off-line\\", and IPLed with the new Core Image Library at the beginning of a business day. A relocatable library for linkable object programs and a source statement library for assembler macros and include text were also supported. Installations could define additional private relocatable and source statement libraries on other disk volumes. =Utilities= DOS/360 had a set of utility programs, an Assembler, and compilers for FORTRAN, COBOL and eventually PL/I, and it supported a range of file organizations with access methods to help in using them: * Sequential data sets were only read or written, one record block at a time from beginning to end. * In indexed (ISAM) files a specified section of each record was defined as a key which could be used to look up specific records. * In direct access (BDAM) files, the application program had to specify the physical location on the disk of the data it wanted to access. BDAM programming was not easy and most customers never used it themselves; but it was the fastest way to access data on disks and many software companies used it in their products, especially database management systems such as ADABAS, IDMS and IBM's DBOMP and DL/I. Sequential and ISAM files could store either fixed-length or variable-length records, and all types could occupy more than one disk volume. =Telecommunications= DOS/360 offered Basic Telecommunications Access Method (BTAM) and Queued Telecommunications Access Method (QTAM). BTAM was primitive and hard to use by later standards, but it allowed communication with almost any type of terminal, which was a big advantage at a time when there was little standardization of communications protocols. The simplicity of its API also allowed the relatively easy interface of external communications processors, which facilitated DOS/360 machines becoming nodes in the multi-tier networks of large organizations. Conversely, QTAM users didn't need as much knowledge about individual devices because QTAM operated at the logical level using the OPEN/CLOSE/GET/PUT macros. Job control All DOS job control statements began with \\"\\" in card columns one and two except end-of-job which was \\"\\", end-of-data, \\"\\", and comments , \\"\\". (In the description that follows the character \\"\\" represents a single blank.) * The statement indicates \\"the beginning of control information for a job.\\" The format is // JOB . must be one to eight alphanumeric characters to identify the job. are ignored. * The statement identifies a program to be executed as a job step. \\"All control statements necessary for execution must be processed\\" before the statement is read. The format is // EXEC * The statement \\"can be used to allow for operator action between job steps.\\" The format is // PAUSE . The comment is used to provide a message to the operator. * The statement may be used to display a message to the operator. The format is . * The end of data statement marks the end of data in the input stream. The format is /*. Any data on the statement following the blank is ignored. * The end of job statement marks the end of a job, and may indicate the end of data to be flushed if the job terminates abnormally. The format is /&. Any data on the statement following the blank is ignored. * The statement specifies values of system options that apply to this job. The format is // OPTION [,...]. * The statement \\"is used to assign a logical I/O unit to a physical device.\\" The format is // ASSGN SYSxxx,[,]. SYSxxx indicates a logical unit such as SYS001 or SYSIPT. is either \\"X'cuu'\\" to indicate a physical device (channel and unit), \\"IGN\\" for ignore, or \\"UA\\" for unassigned. specifies either tape mode settings such as density, parity, etc., or \\"ALT\\" to indicate an alternate device. * The statement resets specified I/O unit assignments to their permanent values. The format is // RESET . may be \\"SYS\\" to reset all system logical unit assignments, \\"PROG\\" to reset all programmer assignments, \\"ALL\\" to reset all assignments, or \\"SYSxxx\\" to reset the assignment for the logical unit \\"SYSxxx\\", for example SYS002. * The statement instructs the system to print a listing of all specified I/O assignments currently in effect. The format is // LISTIO . is \\"SYS\\" to list all system assignments, \\"PROG\\", \\"F1\\", or \\"F2\\" to list all assignments for the background or specified foreground partition, \\"ALL\\", \\"SYSxxx\\", \\"X'cuu'\\", \\"UNITS\\" to list all assigned units, 'UA\\" to list all unassigned units, or \\"DOWN\\" to list all units marked as inoperative. * The statement issues command to a magnetic tape unit. The format is // MTC ,SYSxxx[,]. is a function such as \\"FSF\\" to forward space one file or \\"REW\\" to rewind the tape. is a number that can specify the number of times the operation is to be performed, such as forward space two files. * The statement provides disk or tape volume label information for standard label checking. The format is // VOL SYSxxx,. * DOS originally provided the statement for tape label information and the and statements for disk label and extent information. At least as early as 1968 the statement had been replaced by and the statement by . These statements used numerous positional parameters and had fairly high information densities. Differences from OS/360=Job control language= DOS JCL was designed for parsing speed and simplicity; the resulting positional syntax was significantly more cryptic than OS/360 keyword-driven job control. =Spooling= Early DOS included no spooling sub-system to improve the efficiency of punched card and line printer I/O. By the late 1960s both IBM and aftermarket vendors began filling this void. IBM's spooler was an option called POWER, and Software Design, Inc., an independent software company, sold a spooler called GRASP. =Program loading= DOS/360 had no relocating loader, so programmers had to link edit a separate executable version of each program for each partition, or address space, in which the program was likely to be run. Alternatively assembler-language programs could be written as self-relocating, but that imposed additional complexity and a size penalty, albeit a small one. Large DOS shops with multiple machines and multiple partition layouts often wrote their own relocating loader to circumvent this issue. =Application programming interface= The DOS/360 application programming interface was incompatible with OS/360. High level language programs written for DOS needed to be compiled and linked before they could be used with OS/360. Minor differences between compilers of DOS as opposed to OS sometimes required modifications to programs. The port in the other direction however was more challenging. Since OS/360 had significantly more features supported in its API, any use of those features would have to be removed from programs being ported to DOS. This was less of a problem for programmers working in high level languages such as COBOL. Assembler programs, on the other hand, tended to utilize those very features more often and usually needed greater modification to run on DOS.

Founded in 1651 by Dutch colonists, the neighborhood, which consists of several subsections, had a population of 105,804 as of the 2010 United States Census. Flatbush was a town prior to being incorporated into the City of Brooklyn, and its former border runs through the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Generally, the township was larger than what is considered Flatbush today by the residents of Brooklyn. The modern neighborhood includes or borders several institutions of note, including Prospect Park and Brooklyn College. Flatbush is part of Brooklyn Community District 14, and its primary ZIP Code is 11226. It is patrolled by the 67th and 70th Precincts of the New York City Police Department. Politically, Flatbush is represented by the New York City Council's 40th and 45th Districts.Current City Council Districts for Kings County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. Etymology The name Flatbush is a calque of the Dutch language Vlacke bos (vlacke or vlak, meaning \\"flat\\"; \\"Flatbush\\" meaning \\"flat woodland\\" or \\"wooded plain\\"), so named from woods that grew on the flat country. History=Separate town= Flatbush was originally chartered as the Dutch Nieuw Nederland colony town of Midwout (or Midwoud or Medwoud) — from the Dutch words, med, \\"middle\\" and woud, \\"wood\\" — in 1651. Both names were used in the Dutch era, and Midwood was an alternative name for Flatbush into the early 20th century. In a reversal, Midwood, now the area immediately south of Brooklyn College, is often alternatively called \\"Flatbush,\\" especially among Orthodox Jews. Midwood's residents predominately feature a mix of the latter and Irish Americans. Flatbush and the five other towns of what was to become Kings County, were surrendered to the English in 1664. The town was the county seat for Kings County and was a center of life for what is now called Brooklyn. The compact center of the village of Flatbush was at the intersection of what are now Flatbush and Church avenues, where we still find an old Dutch Reformed Church and Erasmus Hall, the oldest high school in New York City. Flatbush played a key role in the American Revolution. Flatbush was where significant skirmishes and battles of the Battle of Long Island took place. As Kings County was settled largely by the Dutch, and as the Dutch were prominent in the slave trade, the area was somewhat sympathetic to the British side of the American Revolutionary War at the beginning of the conflict. Kings County at the time had the highest concentration of slaves north of the Mason–Dixon line – according to the first federal census in 1790, one-third of the total population for the county were slaves. When a Loyalist Governor of Virginia supported freedom for slaves who supported and fought on the British side, landowners in Brooklyn were concerned that a full conflict between the Colonies and the British would result in loss of their critical source of labor.The Ordeal of Kings County by Edwin G. Burrows as part of Tiedemann and Fingerhut (editors) The Other New York: The American Revolution Beyond New York City 2005 Loyalist residents of Flatbush included David Mathews, Mayor of New York City, who lived at what is now the intersection of Flatbush and Parkside avenues.Vanderbilt, Gertrude Lefferts The Social History of Flatbush, and Manners and Customs of the Dutch Settlers of Kings County D. Appleton & Company, 1881 Flatbush residents maintained their loyalist sympathies: the King's Arms, for example, appeared in the town's inn for a half-century after the conclusion of the conflict. Historian Craig Steven Wilder calculated that between 70 and 80 percent of all Flatbush families in 1800 had an enslaved person. Johannes Lott, the original owner of the Hendrick I. Lott House, was one of the largest Kings County slaveowners with sixteen enslaved people in his household. For several decades after the Revolutionary War, New York merchants and farmers continued to engage in the slave trade. The Gradual Emancipation Law of 1799 emancipated people of African descent born after July 4, 1799. Women born before that date remained enslaved until the age of 25 and men to the age of 28. Men and women escaping enslavement often went to Manhattan, where they could live within the community of free blacks. The influence of Dutch merchant and farming families remained strong in the area until after consolidation into the City of Greater New York in 1898, after which the development of Flatbush as a suburb, and then an integral part of the larger city, proceeded apace. Before it was incorporated into the City of Brooklyn in 1894, Flatbush described both the Town of Flatbush, incorporating a large swath of central Kings County extending east to the Queens County border, and the Village of Flatbush, formerly the heart of the current community. Many of the remaining early Dutch structures are in the Flatlands and Marine Park neighborhoods. =Incorporation into city= Flatbush Public Library in 1915 Church and Flatbush, 2013 Flatbush remained relatively distant from the City of Brooklyn's denser \\"Gold Coast\\" districts (such as Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope and Fort Greene-Clinton Hill, then known collectively as The Hill) following the consolidation of New York City in 1898, but the completion of direct New York City Subway routes to Midtown Manhattan via the BMT Brighton Line and IRT Nostrand Avenue Line in 1920 connected it to surrounding areas in an unprecedented way. As six-story Art Deco apartment houses and more affordable four-story walk-up buildings were developed on Ocean Avenue and throughout its periphery, Flatbush nurtured a socioeconomically diverse population of Irish Americans, Italian Americans and American Jews; according to anthropologist Ansley Hamid, occupants ranged from \\"merchants [and] professionals\\" to \\"skilled [and] manual laborers.\\" Although the Victorian Flatbush neighborhood associations endured and grew to encompass succeeding waves of new residents, urbanization and the increasing prevalence of automobiles compelled the remaining vestiges of the neighborhood's \\"Anglo-Dutch elite\\" to \\"[flee] in droves for the upscale suburbs of Westchester, Long Island and New Jersey\\" by the late 1920s. A significant portion of Flatbush residents closely followed the Brooklyn Dodgers, which at the time were not only the team of Brooklyn but also of Flatbush in particular. Dodgers centerfielder Duke Snider was known as \\"the Duke of Flatbush\\". By 1958, however, the Dodgers left Brooklyn, and Ebbets Field eventually was torn down. Due to shifting neighborhood boundaries, Ebbets Field would today be considered to be in neighboring Crown Heights, as the ballpark was located just north of Empire Boulevard. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Flatbush experienced a shift in demographics due to white flight as it transitioned from a white ethnic enclave to a mostly Caribbean-American community; in an ethnographic interview with Hamid, Trinidadian and Tobagonian American drug supplier and longtime resident \\"Patron\\" asserted that the demographic shift accelerated in 1974: \\"The whites started moving to the outskirts, further across Nostrand Avenue, or towards Sheepshead Bay. A lot moved out to Long Island. And blacks [West Indians] started moving in from Crown Heights, where buildings were being abandoned. A lot of West Indians bought up property, and then in the late 1970s, they too would start moving to Long Island, or to the nicer houses going towards Coney Island Avenue.\\" By now a working class milieu (according to \\"Patron,\\" large apartment buildings gradually shed doormen, porters and other conveniences following the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis), a handful of affluent areas remained. Prospect Park South continued to attract a sizable number of more affluent homeowners, while doctors still resided and practiced on a stretch of Parkside Avenue immediately adjacent to Prospect Park. By the mid-1980s, however, the neighborhood had numerous abandoned or semi-abandoned buildings, many of which had fallen into a state of disrepair. While crime generally had long been prevalent in the community, it worsened significantly during the 1970s, '80s and '90s. A number of stores on Flatbush and Church Avenues fell victim to looting during the 1977 blackout, and a subsequent drug epidemic ravaged Flatbush during the 1980s and early 1990s. In February 2016, Flatbush was one of four neighborhoods featured in an article in The New York Times about \\"New York’s Next Hot Neighborhoods\\".Higgins, Michelle (February 26, 2016) \\"New York’s Next Hot Neighborhoods\\" The New York Times After the Vision Zero initiative was implemented across the city, WNYC found the NYPD targeting this neighborhood 36 percent more than other whiter neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint.Flatbush Activists Want to Know Where the NYPD is Stopping Brooklyn Drivers  Ditmas Park, NY Patch Demographics Victorian Flatbush, at Ditmas Avenue east of Coney Island Avenue Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Flatbush was 105,804, a decrease of 5,071 (4.6%) from the 110,875 counted in 2000.

Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 19.9% (21,030) White, 48.6% (51,470) African American, 0.3% (281) Native American, 9.2% (9,712) Asian, 0.0% (26) Pacific Islander, 0.5% (575) from other races, and 1.9% (2,051) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 19.5% (20,659) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community Board 14, which comprises Flatbush and Midwood, had 165,543 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.4 years. This is slightly higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 25% are between the ages of 0–17, 29% between 25–44, and 24% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 13% respectively. As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 14 was $56,599. In 2018, an estimated 22% of Flatbush and Midwood residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Flatbush and Midwood, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. = Culture = While Flatbush is predominantly African American and West Indian, there are sizable numbers of Caucasians, Latinos and Indian Americans living within its borders. A majority of residents are working class, but there also are middle-class and wealthier residents who call Flatbush home. The primary commercial strips are Flatbush, Church, and Coney Island Avenues. One can find Caribbean food, Soul food, Chinese, Mexican and South Asian restaurants. Most of the businesses are small, with some larger businesses also present. A large part of the culture in Flatbush is the use of \\"dollar vans\\". These \\"vans\\" are actually minibuses that provide a cheaper alternative to riding the MTA. Residents pay $2 to travel along Flatbush Avenue from Kings Plaza to Tillary St. While many dollar vans operate illegally, they are still a major part of transportion in Flatbush. Flatbush housing varies in character. It generally features apartment buildings, though some rowhouses also are present. Older, Victorian-style housing can be found in Prospect Park South, and brownstones are in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. The Flatbush community has been receiving an influx of immigrants from the Caribbean, mostly from Guyana, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Grenada, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Belize, since the 1980s, as well as immigrants from South Asia, primarily India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and African countries like Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Kenya. Haitians are the largest ethnic group in Flatbush. Prior to the arrival of these groups, the Flatbush community had already been diverse, with many Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, African-Americans and Jewish-Americans. Subsections and geographic boundaries The former town of Flatbush coincided roughly with Brooklyn Community District 14, which runs north-south from Prospect Park to Kings Highway. The boundaries of the neighborhood today are not precisely defined, but much of the areas below have typically been considered part of the community. The portion of Flatbush that is not part of any other community is roughly bounded by Clarkson Avenue to the north, New York Avenue to the east, Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch to the south, and Ocean Avenue to the west. The neighborhoods of Flatbush extend south from the old Brooklyn City Line north of the southern edges of Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Empire Boulevard. The southern border of Flatbush neighborhoods is approximately on the line of the Bay Ridge Branch, which runs to the south of Avenue H, the campus of Brooklyn College, and \\"The Junction\\" where Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues intersect. Flatbush's eastern border is roughly around New York Avenue, while its western border is Coney Island Avenue. Neighborhoods within Flatbush include the planned communities of Prospect Park South, the Beverley Squares (Beverley Square East and Beverley Square West), Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace, Victorian Flatbush, and Albemarle-Kenmore Terrace. Bordering Flatbush on the north are the community of Crown Heights and the former neighborhood of Pigtown. On the east, within the old town of Flatbush, is East Flatbush, on the west are Kensington and Parkville (formerly Greenfield), and on the south is Midwood. Midwood, also part of Community District 14, was historically part of the neighboring former towns of New Utrecht, Gravesend and Flatlands. Flatbush includes the southernmost portion of Prospect Park. =Notable institutions= An aerial view of Ebbets Field Well-known institutions within Flatbush include Erasmus Hall High School, the Parade Ground, the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church, and Brooklyn College. The neighborhood also contained Ebbets Field, the last Brooklyn home of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team before it was demolished in 1960; however, due to imprecise boundaries, the Ebbets Field site may also be considered to be in Crown Heights.

The Flatbush Avenue Business Improvement District provides services to keep Flatbush Avenue from Parkside Avenue to Cortelyou Road clean, safe and profitable for its businesses. Every year, the Flatbush BID organizes the Flatbush Avenue Street Fair, an event that celebrates the cultures of the community. The Flatbush Development Corporation (FDC) is a nonprofit that hosts events and programs that are aimed to support the \\"vitality, diversity and quality of life\\" in the Flatbush community. CAMBA, Inc. is a Flatbush- based nonprofit that since 1977 has provided housing, youth education and development, legal services and healthcare services to residents of Flatbush and beyond. Police and crime Flatbush is patrolled by two precincts of the NYPD. The 70th Precinct is located at 154 Lawrence Avenue and serves Ditmas Park, Prospect Park South, and Midwood, while the 67th Precinct is located at 2820 Snyder Avenue and serves East Flatbush. The 70th Precinct ranked 30th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010, while the 67th Precinct ranked 40th safest. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 42 per 100,000 people, Flatbush and Midwood's rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 372 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole. The 70th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 89.1% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 6 murders, 27 rapes, 162 robberies, 273 felony assaults, 173 burglaries, 527 grand larcenies, and 75 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

They are gregarious birds that forage in small groups of six to ten birds, a habit that has given them the popular name of \\"Seven Sisters\\" in urban Northern India, and Saath bhai (seven brothers) in Bengali with cognates in other regional languages which also mean \\"seven brothers\\". The jungle babbler is a common resident breeding bird in most parts of the Indian subcontinent and is often seen in gardens within large cities as well as in forested areas. In the past, the orange-billed babbler, Turdoides rufescens, of Sri Lanka was considered to be a subspecies of jungle babbler, but has now been elevated to a species. Taxonomy Nominate race from Kolkata allopreening The jungle babbler was described by the French zoologist Charles Dumont de Sainte Croix in 1823 based on specimens from Bengal. He coined the binomial name Cossyphus striatus. This babbler was formerly placed in the genus Turdoides but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus Argya. There are several named geographically isolated subspecies that show plumage shade differences. Former race rufescens of Sri Lanka is considered a full species. The widely accepted subspecies include: * striata (Dumont de Sainte Croix, 1823) which is found over much of northern India south of the Himalayan foothills extending to Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bhutan, Assam, Odisha and northeastern Andhra Pradesh. The form found in parts of Odisha, orissae, is said to be more rufous above and is usually subsumed into this. * sindiana (Ticehurst, 1920) is a paler desert form that is found in the Indus River plains of Pakistan and extends into Rajasthan and the Rann of Kutch in India. * somervillei (Sykes, 1832) is found in the northern Western Ghats. * malabarica (Jerdon, 1845) is found in the southern Western Ghats. * orientalis (Jerdon, 1845) is found in peninsular India east of the Western Ghats. Some older literature can be confusing due to some incorrect usage such as with Whistler (1944, Spolia Zeylanica, 23:131), who used the name affinis which is a completely different species, Turdoides affinis, restricted to peninsular India although they two can sometimes be confused in poor lighting conditions. Their calls however are entirely different. Description Adult ssp. orientalis in Kawal, A.P., India. The jungle babbler's habitat is forest and cultivation. This species, like most babblers, is non-migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. The sexes are identical, drably coloured in brownish grey with a yellow-bill making them confusable only with the endemic yellow-billed babblers of peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The upperparts are usually slightly darker in shade and there is some mottling on the throat and breast. The race T. s. somervillei of Maharashtra has a very rufous tail and dark primary flight feathers.The jungle babbler can be separated from the white-headed babbler by the dark loreal zone between the bill and the eye as well as the lack of a contrasting light crown. The calls of the two species are however distinct and unmistakable. The jungle babbler has harsh nasal calls while the white-headed babbler has high pitched calls. Another babbler that is similarly found in urban areas is the large grey babbler, however that species has a distinctive long tail with white outer tail feathers. The jungle babbler lives in flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the harsh mewing calls, continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. Behaviour and ecology Subspecies malabarica These birds are gregarious and very social. They sometimes form the core of a mixed-species foraging flock. They feed mainly on insects, but also eats grains, nectar and berries. The groups maintain territories and will defend it against neighbours but will sometimes tolerate them. For their size, they are long lived and have been noted to live as long as 16.5 years in captivity. When foraging, some birds take up a high vantage point and act as sentinels. They are known to gather and mob potential predators such as snakes. Young birds have a dark iris. Older birds have a pale creamy colour and it has been found that the iris has a dark epithelium which become invisible when the muscle fibres develop in the iris and make the dark basal colours invisible and then appear cream coloured. They breed throughout the year; with peak breeding in northern India being noted between March–April and July–September. Birds reach sexual maturity after their third year. The nest is built halfway in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is three or four (but can be up to seven) deep greenish blue eggs. In northern India, birds breeding during July–September tend to be parasitized by the pied crested cuckoo and sometimes by the common hawk-cuckoo. Helpers assist the parents in feeding the young. Post fledging survival is very high. Birds fledge and females tend to leave their natal group after about two years. Birds within a group often indulge in allopreening, play chases and mock fights. When threatened by predators, they have been said to sometimes feign death. (Note: the reference uses the binomial of the jungle babbler) In culture These birds are very common near towns and cities particularly in northern India and are well known for their habit of moving in groups giving them the local name of \\"Sath Bhai\\" which means seven brethren but translated by the English in India to \\"Seven sisters\\". Visitors to India were very likely to notice these vocal and active birds and Frank Finn notes an incident during the Colonial period in India: The Indian folklorist Saratcandra Mitra recorded a belief among the Lushai-Kuki people that during a solar eclipse, humans could transform into jungle babblers.

Located on the Northwest Side of the City of Chicago with the North Branch of the Chicago River forming its east and north boundaries, it includes the ethnically diverse Albany Park neighborhood, with one of the highest percentages of foreign-born residents of any Chicago neighborhood. Although the majority of those foreign-born residents are from Latin America, mostly from Mexico (especially from the state of Michoacán), Guatemala, and Ecuador, substantial numbers are from the Philippines, India, Korea, Cambodia, Somalia, the former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia), Romania, Pakistan and the Middle East (especially Iraq, Iran, and Lebanon). Over 40 different languages are spoken in its public schools. Due to the diverse population and immigrant population attraction, the population of the neighborhood increased by 16.5% during the 1990s. It is part of the 60625 ZIP code, which is known as one of the most diverse areas in the entire country. History The area was settled in 1893 when several investors purchased land in the area as areas closer to downtown became more heavily populated. DeLancy Louderback from Albany, New York was one of the investors and chose the name. The developers added electric streetcars in 1896 and the Northwestern Elevated Railroad extended the Ravenswood branch to the Kimball terminal on December 14, 1907. This led to a building boom in the area. At this point in development, the north branch of the Chicago River meandered greatly, and therefore the Chicago Sanitary District straightened the river. This expanded and defined property lines and sewage in Albany Park.http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/36.html Intersection of Lawrence Avenue and Kedzie Avenue in 1915. By 1930, the population of the neighborhood reached 55,000, and many schools, religious institutions, and parks opened. Haugan Elementary School became the biggest elementary school in the city and Roosevelt High School's overcrowding led to Von Steuben Elementary being converted into a high school.https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-blogs/albany-park-past-and- present/da30b2d1-6cc2-4a46-8b40-d42d82b8797f Resident began moving to northern suburbs after World War II and the population declined quickly, leaving many stores uninhabited and properties empty. It wasn't until the 1970s, when a new immigration wave from Asia (mainly Korea) and Central America began to increase the population again. Today, Albany Park is the most diverse neighborhood in the city, and one of the most diverse in the entire country.http://www.city-data.com/articles/Albany-Park-Neighborhood-Part- of.html Neighborhoods The traditional neighborhoods within the official community are (including rough boundaries): * Albany Park: North: North Branch of the Chicago River (about 5100 N); South: Montrose Avenue (4400 N): East: North Branch of the River (about 3000 W); West: Pulaski Road (4000 W). * Mayfair: Lawrence Avenue (4800 N), Montrose Avenue (4400 N), Pulaski Road (4000 W), and Cicero Avenue (4800 W). * North Mayfair: Bryn Mawr Avenue (5600 N), Lawrence Avenue (4800 N), Pulaski Road (4000 W), and Cicero Avenue (4800 W).'' Immediately to the north, in North Park, lie Northeastern Illinois University, North Park University, and the Bohemian National Cemetery. =Korean commercial district= The neighborhood was once known as the \\"Koreatown\\" of Chicago, beginning in the 1980s. The majority of Korean shops in Albany Park were found on Lawrence Avenue (4800 North) between Kedzie Avenue (3200 West) and Pulaski Road (4000 West), and many are still there. This particular section of Lawrence Avenue has been officially nicknamed \\"Seoul Drive\\" by the city of Chicago because of the multitude of Korean-owned enterprises on the street. Although many of the Korean Americans in the neighborhood have been moving to the north suburbs in recent years, it still retains its Korean flavor. Every year there is a Korean festival, and the neighborhood is home to a Korean radio station (1330 AM) as well as two Korean-language newspapers. There are still many Korean businesses interspersed among the newer Mexican bakeries and Middle Eastern grocery stores. Approximately 45% of the businesses on this particular stretch of Lawrence Avenue are owned by Korean-Americans.  Demographics  After Jefferson Township was purchased and annexed by the city of Chicago and development began in the area that became Albany Park, immigrant German and Swedish farmers flocked to land. Many built their own homes. At the beginning of the 20th century, more upwardly mobile Russian Jews arrived in Albany Park to escape the crowded conditions of the very-heavily Jewish Near West Side/Maxwell Street area. This pattern continued as other residents in other Jewish-populated neighborhoods such as Lawndale and parts of West Town followed suit. These families began moving to northern suburbs such as Skokie after World War II. Starting in the 1970s, immigrants from Asia and Latin America, mainly Korea and Guatemala, began moving into the neighborhood's largely vacant properties and storefronts. Immigration continued from all around the world, and by the 1990s, there were large populations from the Philippines, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Poland, Vietnam, Burma, Cambodia, Mexico (largely from the state of Michoacán), Ecuador, and Colombia. Since the 1992-1995 war in Yugoslavia, roughly 1,200 Serbians who lived in Croatia resettled in Albany Park along with more than 4,000 Bosnians of all three backgrounds. Into the 2000s, the western part of the neighborhood became home to a substantial number of Indian and East African immigrants. As of 2018, the community area has 50,343 residents. The racial makeup of the community area is 45.66% Hispanic/Latino, 32.03% White/non-Hispanic, 14.31% Asian/non- Hispanic, 4.97% Black/non-Hispanic, and 3.03% other.http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/documents/10180/126764/Albany+Park.pdf Transportation Rebuilt Kedzie Station HouseThe Chicago Transit Authority's Brown Line terminates at Lawrence and Kimball Avenues.

It became the overall command and control authority of the United States Army Air Forces in Europe during World War II. USSTAF had started as the Eighth Air Force, a complementary command to that of the smaller Ninth Air Force, Twelfth Air Force, and Fifteenth Air Forces. As the oldest command, which had begun the earliest American operations in Europe as VIII Bomber Command, the Eighth had provided British liaison and strategic tasking guidance to each of those younger organizations throughout the war. With the in-depth Allied contacts and overall responsibility directly affecting the strategic bombing of industrial regions of Germany the Eighth's planning and intelligence staffs were the natural best choice to assert overall coordinated control with the D-Day Operation Overlord needs of the Allies, under General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander. Subsequently, the strategic bombing effort's intelligence, targeting and planning, co-ordination, including mission designation command and control were separated—not without controversy and opposition—from actual operations commands in direct control of air forces on 23 February 1944. The new command was organized on the large nucleus of Eighth Air Force planning staff members, thereby creating the USSTAF—at which time the USSTAF was also given mission planning control over other US Air Forces opposing Germany and Italy, and shrinking the man-power assigned to the Eighth Air Force. The USSTAF was established with the redesignation of the former VIII Bomber Command as the Eighth Air Force on 22 February 1944. The strategic planning command staff of what had formerly been the Eighth Air Force became a higher echelon command coordinating with the British in the target prioritization of the strategic bombing of the Axis. In this expanded role, USSTAF exercised operational control of the reorganized Eighth Air Force, administrative control of the Ninth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations and, to an extent, the operations of Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations—all of which had theretofore carried out their own strategic planning. VIII Fighter Command was brought under the command of the newly redesignated Eighth Air Force, while VIII Bomber Command was inactivated. Beginning in March 1944, Air Service Command, USSTAF progressively took over all base service functions. IX Air Force Service Command did away with its base air depot area and on 17 May transferred its most important installations (Baverstock and Filton) to ASC, USSTAF, which continued to use them to provide base services for the Ninth.HyperWar There is some difference of opinion about the USSTAF insignia/emblem. Most sources state the letters stand for United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe. However, there is evidence indicating – at least initially – it was United States Strategic & Tactical Air Forces. Flight article. UK, April 1944.Armed Forces Insignia/Freedom’s War.

(Quoted in Trident Scholar report. US Naval Academy, Annapolis, 1994.) Formation of USAFE left Shortly after VE-Day, the United States Army Air Forces in Europe began to demobilize. In May 1945, USSTAF consisted of about 17,000 aircraft and about 500,000 personnel. In Europe the aim was to maintain a small USAAF organization, exclusively for communication and transport purposes. On 7 August 1945, the United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) was redesignated as the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Headquarters USAFE was relocated to Wiesbaden, Germany, on 28 September 1945. By the end of 1946, the American Air Force in Europe was reduced drastically, to around 75,000 personnel and less than 2,000 aircraft.

The yellow-billed babbler is a common resident breeding bird in Sri Lanka and southern India. Its habitat is scrub, cultivation and garden land. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight and is usually seen calling and foraging in groups. It is often mistaken for the jungle babbler, whose range overlaps in parts of southern India, although it has a distinctive call and tends to be found in more vegetated habitats. Its name is also confused with T. leucocephala, which is also known as white-headed babbler. Taxonomy The yellow-billed babbler was formerly placed in the genus Turdoides but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus Argya. Description Adult of nominate form showing pale cap These birds have grey brown upperparts, grey throat and breast with some mottling, and a pale buff belly. The head and nape are grey. The Sri Lankan form T. a. taprobanus is drab pale grey. Nominate race of southern India has whitish crown and nape with a darker mantle. The rump is paler and the tail has a broad dark tip. Birds in the extreme south of India are very similar to the Sri Lankan subspecies with the colour of the crown and back being more grey. The eye is bluish white. The Indian form is more heavily streaked on the throat and breast. The Sri Lankan subspecies resembles the jungle babbler, Turdoides striatus, although that species does not occur on the island. Seven distinctive vocalizations have been noted in this species and this species has a higher pitched call than the jungle babbler. The jungle babbler has calls that have a harsher and nasal quality. The taxonomy of this species was confused in the past and confounded with the sympatric jungle babbler and the orange-billed babbler of Sri Lanka. Distribution and habitat This species is patchily distributed in southern India and Sri Lanka. The nominate subspecies is found in Andhra Pradesh, south of the Godavari river and Karnataka south of Belgaum into Tamil Nadu. It prefers lower altitudes and drier habitats than the jungle babbler but sometimes is found alongside it. The Sri Lankan subspecies is found in the lowlands and hills up to about 1500m avoiding heavy forest. Behaviour and ecology A group of ssp. taprobanus (Colombo) The yellow-billed babbler lives in flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. One member often perches high and acts as a sentinel while the remaining members of the flock forage on or close to the ground. They feeds mainly on insects, but also eat fruit, nectar and human food scrap. They have been known to take Calotes versicolor lizard and whip-scorpions. They do not fly long distances, the maximum distance flown non-stop was about 180 m and prior to flying, they usually gain height by moving up a tree or tall shrub. Black drongos, rufous treepies and Indian palm squirrels are often seen foraging near these babblers. Yellow-billed Babblers allopreening Birds wake up before dawn around 6 AM and begin foraging. They are relatively inactive in the hot hours of the day from 1330 to 1630. They assemble in groups around 1900 hrs and preen themselves before going to roost. Members of a group roost next to each other with some juveniles wedging themselves in the middle of the group. When foraging the sentinel bird calls with wing fluttering and hopping. Allopreening is a common activity, particularly in winter, and members may beg for food from other members. Yellow-billed babblers particularly like to take baths, and may visit birdbaths in their general territories, usually around late afternoon to evening time. Sometimes these birds have been observed visiting birdbaths at around 18:30hours, after sunset, when darkness is beginning to set in. A study in the Sivakasi plains noted that groups had a home range of 0.4 km2 and the population density was about 55 birds per km2. =Breeding= Nests of the species have are seen round the year but the peak breeding season is prior to the onset of the Southwest Monsoon. It builds its nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The majority of nests are placed below a height of four metres. The nest is a small cup placed in a fork of a branch. The normal clutch is two to four turquoise blue eggs, although up to five may be laid by birds in the hills of Sri Lanka. The eggs hatch after 14 to 16 days. Brooding parent bird often stands on the rim of the nest rather than sit on the chicks. Brood parasitism by the pied cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus) is known from both the Indian and Sri Lankan region. The common hawk-cuckoo has also been noted as a brood-parasite. In an exceptional case, jungle babblers have been seen feeding the chicks of the yellow-billed babbler. Chicks are fed mainly insects and the occasional lizard. Like most perching birds, the parents take care of nest sanitation, removing the faecal sacs of the young, typically by swallowing them. Helpers have been seen to assist the parents in building the nest as well as in feeding the chicks at the nest. =Mortality= Predators of the eggs include mongoose, crows and the greater coucal which may also prey on chicks. Rat snakes (Ptyas mucosus) may sometimes take chicks. In culture In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as demalichcha in Sinhala language.

Profile of Sanjiang, official website of Sanjiang County Government Transportation *China National Highway 209 *Reach by bus from Longsheng Rice Terrace about 1.5 hours, Guilin 4.5 hours *Sanjiang County Railway Station, about from the main square and \\"Bird's Nest\\" bullfighting arena. *Sanjiang South Railway Station, also about south from the main square. This train station mainly serves the Guiyang Guangzhou high speed railway that pass through the area. Tourism north of Sanjiang, toward Hunan province, lies the Dong district, Chengyang (程阳) which is a popular destination for backpacker tourism. The district comprises eight traditional Dong minority villages. The houses are all made of wood. Inside the villages you will find traditional drum towers, which were used to announce important things or simply to perform plays to entertain the villagers. Crossing the river is the best preserved Wind and Rain Bridge (程阳风雨桥, chéng yáng fēng yǔ qiáo) which has five parts. The bridge dates to the 1920s and is for many people the main reason to visit the village. North of Chengyang lies the tiny village of Linxia which is interesting because of the local market. There are no places to stay in Linxia, but a taxi from Sanjiang or Chengyang brings you there easily.

He is the past President and Chief Executive Officer and former Director of Torstar Corporation. He is now the Chairman of the Bank of Montreal. Academia Born in London, England, Prichard attended prep school at Upper Canada College before studying economics at Swarthmore College, business at the University of Chicago, and law at the University of Toronto and Yale Law School. Prichard joined the Faculty of Law at the University of Toronto in 1976. He served as Dean of the faculty from 1984 to 1990. Prichard was appointed the thirteenth president of the University of Toronto in 1990, a position which he held until 2000. During his ten years as president, the U of T's endowment rose to $1.4 billion, the most of any Canadian university. Toronto Star Upon leaving the University of Toronto, Prichard became the president of the Star Media Group and chief operating officer of the Torstar Corporation in May 2001. In 2004, Prichard pushed out John Honderich as publisher of the Toronto Star because he resisted making the deep cost cuts that Prichard demanded.Gordon Pitts, \\"Honderich said ousted over cost cuts; Observers say CEO Robert Prichard told Star publisher to go after he re-sisted demands to slash costs \\", The Globe and Mail, January 27, 2004 However, in 2006, Honderich, a Torstar director who chairs a voting trust comprising five families that control Torstar, instigated a \\"coup\\" among the five families that resulted in the termination of Prichard's chosen publisher Michael Goldbloom and editor-in-chief Giles Gherson.Sinclair Stewart, Grant Robertson and Jacquie Mcnish, \\"Private feud, public company; Torstar's share price and flagship Star newspaper have been bleeding along with most of its industry peers.\\", The Globe and Mail, October 21, 2006 Some have suggested that Torstar's financial woes have been caused by Prichard's distraction by his presence on several boards, including Onex and Four Seasons.Eric Reguly, \\"Knives may be out for Torstar's Prichard\\", The Globe and Mail, October 17, 2006 Prichard has also been a member of Imasco's board of directors since 1993. Imasco owns and controls Imperial Tobacco, the largest tobacco manufacturer in Canada. Prichard's involvement with Imasco was the subject of criticism, due to a perceived conflict of interest for his role as university head. During Prichard's term as president, the University of Toronto accepted $2 million from Imasco between 1997 and 1999. In 1998, Imasco contributed just over $2.5 million to educational institutions across the country. Similar conflict of interest concerns have been raised about the 2005 deal engineered by Prichard by which Torstar acquired a 20 per cent stake in broadcaster and rival publisher Bell Globemedia Inc.David Bruser, \\"Media map rewritten as Torstar buys into rival\\", The Toronto Star, December 3, 2005 Political work Prichard served on the transition teams of three Ontario premiers of three different parties: Liberal David Peterson in 1985, New Democrat Bob Rae in 1990, and Progressive Conservative Mike Harris in 1995. Prichard was deemed by several political insiders to be a contender in the race to become Liberal Party Leader, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Paul Martin. Business career Prichard is past President and Chief Executive Officer and former Director of Torstar Corporation, and also sits on the Boards of George Weston Limited, Onex Corporation, and is the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Montreal.

The name comes from their breeding origins in New South Wales; they were originally known as \\"New South Walers\\". Origins and characteristics The Waler combined a variety of breeds; particularly the Thoroughbred, Arab, the Cape horse (from the Cape of Good Hope), Timor Pony and perhaps a little Clydesdale or Percheron. It was originally considered only a \\"type\\" of horse and not a distinct breed. However, as a landrace bred under the extreme climate and challenging working conditions of Australia, the Waler developed into a hardy horse with great endurance even when under extreme stress from lack of food and water. It was used as a stockman's horse and prized as a military remount. Walers were also used by bushrangers, troopers and exploration expeditions that traversed inland Australia.Mather, Jill, Forgotten Heroes – The Australian Waler Horse, Bookbound Publishing, Ourimbah, NSW, The preferred Walers for cavalry duties were 15 to 16 hands high (). Those over 16 hands were rejected for use in the South Australian Bushmen Corps. Unbroken horses, as well as those with grey and broken (spotted) coat colours were also rejected. The selected horses had to be of a good type that could carry sixteen or seventeen stone (102 to 108 kg (224 to 238 lbs)) day after day. The Walers carried the rider, saddle, saddle cloth, bridle, head collar, lead rope, a horseshoe case with one front and one hind shoe, nails, rations for the horse and rider, a bedroll, change of clothing, a rifle and about 90 rounds of .303 rifle ammunition. The gaits of the Waler were considered ideal for a cavalry mount; it could maintain a fast walk and could progress directly to a steady, level canter without resorting to a trot which was noisy, liable to dislodge gear and resulted in soreness in the horse's back. The cavalry horse required docility, courage, speed, and athletic ability, as it carried the rider into battle. The infantryman’s horse was used as a means of transport from one point to another, for example, from camp to a battle ground, where the horses were kept back from the fighting. Heavier animals were selected and used for draught and packhorse duties.Barrie, Douglas M., The Australian Bloodhorse, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1956 Most of the early Walers carried a fair percentage of Thoroughbred blood, with some recorded as race winners and a few being registered in the Australian Stud Book. While in warfare service in North Africa, some Walers proved successful in races against local Egyptian horses and assorted Thoroughbreds. In 1919 horses from the ANZAC Mounted Division won five of the six events at Heliopolis, near Cairo. History Memorial to the Australian Light Horse, Tamworth, NSW A plaque on the Waler horse memorial, Tamworth, NSW. Australian horses were sent overseas from the 1830s; between the 1840s and 1940s, there was a steady trade in Walers to the British Indian Army.M is for Mates – Animals in Wartime from Ajax to Zep, Department of Veterans Affairs, Woden, ACT, 2009, In Australia's two wars of the early 20th centurythe Second Boer War and World War Ithe Waler was the backbone of the Australian Light Horse mounted forces. It was especially suited to working in the harsh climate of the Sinai Peninsula and Palestine, where it proved superior to the camel as a means of transporting large bodies of troops. During the Boer War, Australia dispatched 16,314 horses overseas for use by the Australian Infantry Forces. In the First World War, 121,324 Walers were sent overseas to the allied armies in Africa, Europe, India and Palestine.Australian Encyclopedia, Vol. 4, Grolier Society, Sydney Of these, 39,348 served with the First Australian Imperial Force, mainly in the Middle East, while 81,976 were sent to India. Due to the costs said to be incurred for \\"returning horses home\\" with their mounts and perhaps to a lesser extent, quarantine restrictions, only one Waler is known to have been returned to Australia; \\"Sandy\\", the mount of Major-General W.T. Bridges, an officer who died at Gallipoli in May 1915. The English cavalry officer, Lt Col RMP Preston DSO, summed up the Australian Light Horses' performance in his book, The Desert Mounted Corps: > \\"… (November 16th, 1917) The operations had now continued for 17 days > practically without cessation, and a rest was absolutely necessary > especially for the horses. Cavalry Division had covered nearly 170 miles…and > their horses had been watered on an average of once in every 36 hours…. The > heat, too, had been intense and the short rations, 9½ lb of grain per day > without bulk food, had weakened them greatly. Indeed, the hardship endured > by some horses was almost incredible. One of the batteries of the Australian > Mounted Division had only been able to water its horses three times in the > last nine days - the actual intervals being 68, 72 and 76 hours > respectively. Yet this battery on its arrival had lost only eight horses > from exhaustion, not counting those killed in action or evacuated wounded. > … The majority of horses in the Corps were Walers and there is no doubt > that these hardy Australian horses make the finest cavalry mounts in the > world…. They (the Australians) have got types of compact, well-built, saddle > and harness horses that no other part of the world can show. Rather on the > light side according to our ideas, but hard as nails and with beautiful > clean legs and feet. Their records in this war place them far above the > Cavalry horse of any other nation. The Australians themselves can never > understand our partiality for the half-bred weight-carrying hunter, which > looks to them like a cart horse. Their contention has always been that good > blood will carry more weight than big bone, and the experience of this war > has converted the writer, for one, entirely to their point of view. It must > be remembered that the Australian countrymen are bigger, heavier men than > their English brothers. They formed just half the Corps and it probable that > they averaged not far off 12 stone each stripped. To this weight must be > added another 9-1/2 stone for saddle, ammunition, sword, rifle, clothes and > accoutrements, so that each horse carried a weight of 21 stone, all day for > every day for 17 days, - on less than half the normal ration of forage and > with only one drink in every 36 hours! > The weight-carrying English Hunter had to be nursed back to fitness after > these operations and for a long period, while the little Australian horses > without any special care, other than good food and plenty of water were soon > fit to go through another campaign as arduous as the last one!….\\" One well-known Waler was Major Michael Shanahan’s mount, \\"Bill the Bastard\\", who bucked when asked to gallop. Yet, during World War I, when the major found four Australians outflanked by the Turks, \\"Bill the Bastard\\" carried all five men – three on his back and one on each stirrup – through soft sand at a lumbering gallop, without first bucking. At the end of the war, 11,000 surplus horses in the Middle East were sold to the British Army as remounts for Egypt and India. Some horses that were categorised as being unfit were destroyed. Also, some light horsemen chose to destroy their horses rather than part with them, but this was an exception, despite the popular myth that portrays it as the fate of all the war horses. Parting with their Walers was one of the hardest events the light horsemen had to endure. A poem by \\"Trooper Bluegum\\" sums up the men's sentiment: ::I don't think I could stand the thought of my old fancy hack :: Just crawling round old Cairo with a 'Gyppo on his back. ::Perhaps some English tourist out in Palestine may find :: My broken- hearted Waler with a wooden plough behind. ::No: I think I'd better shoot him and tell a little lie: :: \\"He floundered in a wombat hole and then lay down to die.\\" ::May be I'll get court-martialled; but I'm damned if I'm inclined :: To go back to Australia and leave my horse behind. '' :::From Australia in Palestine, 1919 During World War II, 360 Australian Walers were assigned to the Texas National Guard 112th Cavalry in New Caledonia. The horses were eventually deemed unfit for jungle warfare. They were sent to India where they served with the Chinese Army before being assigned to the unit known as Merrill's Marauders.p.66 Ogburn Jr, Charlton The Marauders 1959 Harper 1982 edition As demand for remounts declined in the 1940s, the Waler trade ended. When the Australian Stock Horse Society was formed in 1971, the majority of horses accepted into its studbook were Waler horses. The ASHS also accepted horses of other breeds, notably Quarter horses, which has always been controversial. While many stock horses do have Quarter horse genetics in their breeding, not all do, as there are still many breeders who only breed horses of the old heritage bloodlines. These heritage stock horses have extensive pedigrees, often back to the 19th century, and are direct descendants of Walers with no Quarter Horse or other modern breeds. Carruthers, Fiona. The Horse in Australia. Random House Australia, 2008, ch. 12. In the 1980s efforts began to reestablish the breed using feral Walers descended from horses that had been set loose in rural regions after the commercial trade ceased. The Waler horse now has two breed associations interested in preserving it, the Waler Horse Owners and Breeders Association Australia Inc. (WHOBAA) and the Waler Horse Society of Australia Inc (WHSA). Only horses and their progeny derived from the old bloodlines, with no imported genetics since 1945, can be registered as Walers with the WHOBAA.\\"Saving a nation builder\\", p. 17, Outback Magazine, Feb/Mar 2010, R.M. Williams Publishing A memorial statue to the Waler Light Horse was erected at Tamworth, New South Wales as a tribute to the men of the ANZAC Corps who served in the Boer, Sudan and First World Wars. This memorial was constructed at a cost of $150,000, funded by grants from Federal and State Governments, the Tamworth Regional Council, Joblink Plus and donations from business houses, property owners, RSL Members and the community.

These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in southeast Asia. The blackcap babbler is a common resident breeding bird in west Africa from Senegal to Cameroon. Its habitat is thick scrub and forest. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. It builds its cup-shaped nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three eggs. These birds have dark grey-brown upperparts. The head is brownish black with a white throat and conspicuous white eye ring. The underparts are white, mottled on the breast and with buff flanks. The blackcap babbler lives in flocks of four to twelve or more, which help to raise the young communally. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. The main call is a cha-ka-ta. It feeds mainly on insects, but also eats fruit. The binomial commemorates the botanist Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt. References * Birds of The Gambia by Barlow, Wacher and Disley, *Collar, N.

In adult life, he stood tall, due to cartilage–hair hypoplasia dwarfism, and because of his short stature, he was often cast in movies opposite taller performers for comic effect. He specialized in outspoken or wisecracking characters. During the 1950s, he became a television actor, appearing regularly in the Spike Jones ensemble. In the early 1970s he was a staple in a variety of roles in children's TV programs produced by Sid and Marty Krofft. Early life Barty was born October 25, 1924 in Millsboro, Pennsylvania, the son of Albert Steven and Ellen Cecial Bertanzetti. His paternal grandfather was Italian. The family moved to California in 1927. He had two sisters, Delores and Evelyn. Career Barty co-starred with Mickey Rooney in the Mickey McGuire shorts, a comedy series of the 1920s and 1930s based on the Toonerville Folks comics. Small for his age even then, Barty would impersonate very young children alongside brawny authority figures or wild animals, making these threats seem even larger by comparison. In the 1933 film Gold Diggers of 1933, a nine-year- old Barty appeared as a baby who escapes from his stroller. He also appeared as The Child in the 1933 film Footlight Parade. He is briefly seen in the 1935 film Bride of Frankenstein, in an uncredited role as a baby in one of Dr. Pretorius' experiments, although his close-ups were cut out of the picture. Much of Barty's film work consisted of bit parts and gag roles. He appeared in Fireman Save My Child (with Spike Jones), and also appeared in two Elvis Presley films, Roustabout (in one scene) and Harum Scarum, as a co-star without dialogue. =Television= Barty appeared several times on The Dennis Day Show, including once as a leprechaun. Beginning in 1958, he played pool hustler Babby, an occasional \\"information resource\\", in eight episodes of the Peter Gunn TV series. Barty starred in the Rawhide episode \\"Prairie Elephant\\" in 1961. Barty was known for his boundless energy and enthusiasm for any productions in which he appeared. He performed with the Spike Jones musical comedy show on stage and television, and is remembered for his remarkable parody of flamboyant pianist Liberace. Barty also starred in a local Southern California children's show, Billy Barty's Bigtop, in the mid-1960s, which regularly showed The Three Stooges shorts. In one program, Stooge Moe Howard visited the set as a surprise guest. The program gave many Los Angeles area children their first opportunity to become familiar with little people, who until then had been rarely seen on the screen except as two-dimensional curiosities. He also appeared as a guest host on KTTV's Sheriff John's Lunch Brigade whenever \\"Sheriff John\\" Rovick was on vacation. Barty also made regular appearances on The Red Skelton Hour during the mid-1960s. Barty starred in a full-body costumes as \\"Sparky the Firefly\\" in the children's television shows The Bugaloos from 1970 to 1972, and as \\"Sigmund\\" in Sigmund and the Sea Monsters from 1974 to 1976, both produced by Sid and Marty Krofft. Out of costume, he played the evil sidekick on the Kroffts' Dr. Shrinker from 1976 to 1977. Meanwhile, he played Toulouse Lautrec in the 1972 The Brady Bunch Saturday morning cartoons preview special The Brady Bunch Meet ABC's Saturday Superstars. He was a regular cast member of comedian Redd Foxx's variety show The Redd Foxx Show. Barty appeared in an episode of Barney Miller in 1977, and an episode of The Love Boat in 1978. Another show he guest- starred in was CHiPs. In June 1978, Barty guest-starred in the final episode of Man from Atlantis titled \\"Deadly Carnival\\". He also guest starred in two episodes of Little House on the Prairie playing a circus member in the episode \\"Annabelle\\". Also in a later episode (\\"Little Lou\\") as a single dad trying to raise a baby daughter. Barty was regularly seen on Bizarre, a weekly Canadian TV sketch comedy series, airing from 1980 to 1985. In 1981, he appeared in a documentary called Being Different and in late 1985, he appeared as Rose Nylund's father in a dream sequence on an episode of The Golden Girls titled \\"A Little Romance\\". In 1982, Barty appeared in an episode of Hart to Hart called \\"A Christmas Hart\\" (Season 4, Episode 10). He played a bookie named Big Miller. In 1983, Barty supplied the voice for \\"Figment\\" in EPCOT Center's Journey Into Imagination dark ride. He subsequently supplied a reprisal for the second incarnation, though very brief. Barty was an annual guest-star on Canada's Telemiracle telethon, one of the most successful (per capita) telethons in the world. Billy appeared on a 1976 episode of Celebrity Bowling paired with Dick Martin, defeating John Schuck and Michael Ansara, 120–118. =Activism= Barty was a noted activist for the promotion of rights for others with dwarfism. He was disappointed with contemporary Hervé Villechaize's insistence that they were \\"midgets\\" instead of actors with dwarfism. Barty founded the Little People of America organization to help people with dwarfism in 1957 when he called upon people of short stature to join him in a get-together in Reno, Nevada. That original meeting of 21 people grew into Little People of America, a group which as of 2010 has more than 6,800 members. It was the first North American organization for little people. =Other= In 1981, Barty received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6922 Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the film industry. In 1990, Barty was sued in small claims court by two of the writers of his cancelled comedy television series Short Ribbs, which aired for 13 weeks in the autumn of 1989 as a local program on KDOC-TV. Producer and writer William Winckler and writer Warren Taylor filed separate lawsuits against Barty for money owed, and Barty lost both cases. Barty claimed the lawsuit news was the most publicity he ever got, and compared it to similar press that celebrity Zsa Zsa Gabor received for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer. A tribute book on Barty's life was published in December 2002. Within Reach: An Inspirational Journey into the Life, Legacy and Influence of Billy Barty was produced by Barty's nephew, Michael Copeland, and Copeland's wife, Debra. In the 1980s he owned a popular roller rink in Fullerton, CA that also booked bands on weekends. Personal life In 1962, he married Shirley Bolingbroke of Malad City, Idaho. They had two children, Lori Neilson and TV/film producer and director Braden Barty.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/12/25/diminutive- actor-billy-barty-dies-at-76/af2974e2-9e67-4856-911e-d6acff51ecf2/ Barty and his family were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. =Death= Barty died of heart failure in 2000 at age 76.
