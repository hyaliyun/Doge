Cellphone surveillance (also known as cellphone spying) may involve the tracking, bugging, monitoring, eavesdropping and recording of conversations and text messages on mobile phones. It also encompasses the monitoring of people's movements, which can be tracked using mobile phone signals when phones are turned on. Mass cellphone surveillance = Stingray devices = StingRay devices are a technology which mimics a cellphone tower, causing nearby cellphones to connect and pass data through them instead of legitimate towers. This is invisible to the end-user, and allows the operator of the device full access to any communicated data. This is a form of Man-in-the- middle attack. StingRays are used by law enforcement agencies to track people's movements, and intercept and record conversations, names, phone numbers and text messages from mobile phones. Their use entails the monitoring and collection of data from all mobile phones within a target area. Law enforcement agencies in Northern California that have purchased StingRay devices include the Oakland Police Department, San Francisco Police Department, Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, San Jose Police Department and the Fremont Police Department. The Fremont Police Department's use of a StingRay device is in a partnership with the Oakland Police Department and the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. End-to-end encryption such as Signal Messenger protects traffic against stingray devices via cryptographic strategies. A typical cell tower mounted on electric lines. = Tower dumps = A tower dump is the sharing of identifying information by a cell tower operator, which can be used to identify where a given individual was at a certain time. As mobile phone users move, their devices will connect to nearby cell towers in order to maintain a strong signal even while the phone is not actively in use. These towers record identifying information about cellphones connected to them which then can be used to track individuals. In most of the United States, police can get many kinds of cellphone data without obtaining a warrant. Law-enforcement records show, police can use initial data from a tower dump to ask for another court order for more information, including addresses, billing records and logs of calls, texts and locations. Targeted surveillance =Software vulnerabilities= Cellphone bugs can be created by disabling the ringing feature on a mobile phone, allowing a caller to call a phone to access its microphone and listening. One example of this was the group FaceTime bug. In the United States, the FBI has used \\"roving bugs\\", which entails the activation of microphones on mobile phones to enable the monitoring of conversations. =Cellphone spying software= Cellphone spying software is a type of cellphone bugging, tracking, and monitoring software that is surreptitiously installed on mobile phones. This software can enable conversations to be heard and recorded from phones upon which it is installed. Cellphone spying software can be downloaded onto cellphones. Cellphone spying software enables the monitoring or stalking of a target cellphone from a remote location with some of the following techniques:News report. WTHR News. (YouTube video) * Allowing remote observation of the target cellphone position in real-time on a map * Remotely enabling microphones to capture and forward conversations. Microphones can be activated during a call or when the phone is on standby for capturing conversations near the cellphone. * Receiving remote alerts and/or text messages each time somebody dials a number on the cellphone * Remotely reading text messages and call logs Cellphone spying software can enable microphones on mobile phones when phones are not being used, and can be installed by mobile providers. = Bugging = Intentionally hiding a cell phone in a location is a bugging technique. Some hidden cellphone bugs rely on Wi-Fi hotspots, rather than cellular data, where the tracker rootkit software periodically \\"wakes up\\" and signs into a public Wi-Fi hotspot to upload tracker data onto a public internet server. = Lawful interception = Governments may sometimes legally monitor mobile phone communications - a procedure known as lawful interception. In the United States the government pays phone companies directly to record and collect cellular communications from specified individuals. U.S. law enforcement agencies can also legally track the movements of people from their mobile phone signals upon obtaining a court order to do so. = Real-time location data = In 2018, United States cellphone carriers, AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint, that sell customers' real-time location data publicly stated that they would cease those data sales because the FCC found that the companies had been negligent in protecting the personal privacy of its customers' data. Location aggregators, bounty hunters, and others including law enforcement agencies that did not obtain search warrants, use that information. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai concluded that carriers had apparently violated federal law. However, during 2019, the carriers were continuing to sell real-time location data. During late February 2020, the FCC was seeking fines on the carriers in the case. Occurrences In 2005, the prime minister of Greece was advised that his, over 100 dignitaries', and the mayor of Athens' mobile phones were bugged. Kostas Tsalikidis, a Vodafone- Panafon employee, was implicated in the matter as using his position as head of the company's network planning to assist in the bugging. Tsalikidis was found hanged in his apartment the day before the leaders were notified about the bugging, which was reported as \\"an apparent suicide.\\" Security holes within Signalling System No. 7 (SS7), called Common Channel Signalling System 7 (CCSS7) in the US and Common Channel Interoffice Signaling 7 (CCIS7) in the UK, were demonstrated at Chaos Communication Congress, Hamburg in 2014. Detection Some indications of possible cellphone surveillance occurring may include a mobile phone waking up unexpectedly, using a lot of the CPU when on idle or when not in use, hearing clicking or beeping sounds when conversations are occurring and the circuit board of the phone being warm despite the phone not being used. However, sophisticated surveillance methods can be completely invisible to the user and may be able to evade detection techniques currently employed by security researchers and ecosystem providers. Prevention Preventive measures against cellphone surveillance include not losing or allowing strangers to use a mobile phone and the utilization of an access password. Turning off and then also removing the battery from a phone when not in use is another technique. Jamming or a Faraday cage may also work, the latter obviating removal of the battery. Another solution is cellphone with physical (electric) switch, or isolated electronic switch that disconnects microphone, camera without bypass, meaning switch can be operated by user only - no software can connect it back.

Much of Birmingham's work has focused on the work of Hannah Arendt, to whose thought she is considered to have made a profound contribution, although her interest has also ranged widely through other subjects, primarily in modern social and political philosophy, as well as feminist theory. Education and career Birmingham received her bachelor's from the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay in 1978 before moving to Duquesne University where she received her master's and doctoral degrees in philosophy in 1980 and 1986, respectively. After receiving her doctoral degree, Birmingham accepted an appointment as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Marist College, where she stayed until 1990. In 1990, she moved to the New York City campus of Pace University as Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Edward J. Mortola Scholar. In 1992, she accepted an appointment at DePaul University as full Professor of Philosophy. Research areas and publications Birmingham has published two books - Hannah Arendt and the Right to Have Rights: The Predicament of Common Responsibility in 2006, and Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics in 1995. She's also contributed a large number of book chapters, an encyclopedia entry, and a dozen peer-reviewed papers. Most of Birmingham's work has focused on or built on top of the work of Hannah Arendt (though despite Arendt's moral minimalism, Birmingham is a moral maximalist.) In Hannah Arendt and the Right to Have Rights: The Predicament of Common Responsibility, Birmingham rejects claims that Arendt's notion of a basic 'right to have rights' is fundamentally flawed, and argues that the right to have rights (that is, to belong to a state that respects rights) is something that should be guaranteed by humanity (though Birmingham acknowledges that she is not sure whether this is in fact practical.) Birmingham views Arendt as having constructed the notion of the 'right to have rights' in such a way as to be meaningful in a world that lacks universal humanity. Birmingham views Arendt's work as a whole as an effort to construct a 'right to have rights' absent the concepts of shared humanity, reason, individual autonomy, and other common justifications behind the idea of a 'right to have rights.'

It marks a change in the narrative, being set in the future - 2018 is the affirmed setting. It is ten years on from the other four books in the series and the world is in dark times. The Old Ones have started their war and the Five have to find each other again. This book was started in 2009 and was finished in 2012. This book is unique because it isn't a rewrite of a previous Pentagram novel, and contains several different narratives and plots. Plot synopsis After being separated from the world by ten years, the Gatekeepers and their closest allies finally come back through the mysterious doors. Jamie is the first to appear, in a church called St Boltoph's, somewhere in the north east of England, located in a strange and seemingly hostile village. There is no electricity nor power of another kind and the townspeople are weary and hostile. He meets a girl named Holly, and a strange man who calls himself \\"the Traveller\\", who takes them under his wing. Meanwhile, the executives of the now nigh-all-powerful Nightrise Corporation are in the ruins of New York attending a business conference named the \\"Endgame\\" where, it is said, they will be given their rewards. But these \\"rewards\\" are really to become leading soldiers of the Old Ones. A riot ensures in the United Nations and twenty of the executives are killed. All but one of the rest are consigned to training camps in the country to prepare for the final outcome. The one who survived is Jonas Mortlake, who is given, by the new chairman, the task of winning Scott over to the Old Ones, to allow them to capture Matt. Back in the village, Jamie is having trouble fitting in. He finally tells Holly the truth about him and the Five, and although she initially doesn't believe him, she eventually sees the truth, especially when one of her villagers, teacher Anne Keyland, betrays them all to the police, who kill everyone in the village and then obliterate the village itself. The Traveller saves Jamie, and Holly comes along, despite the Traveller disagreeing with this idea. They make a dark and dangerous journey towards London - which no longer exists, as Jamie knows it, because it was bombed by terrorists shortly after the Gatekeepers disappeared, as well as eight other cities in Britain, which were all hit on the same day. But the door in Saint Meredith's church still exists, and this is what Jamie is looking for. But on the way to London, they run into a village whose inhabitants have become cannibals, as well as being pursued by Commander Eleanor Strake, the Old Ones' chief servant in England. Scott and Pedro come through a door in Italy, where they are immediately captured by the police working for the Old Ones and imprisoned in a castle. Scott is taken to meet Jonas Mortlake, who was at the Endgame Conference, but he was the chief executive officer of Nightrise (as well as the son of Susan Mortlake) so he wasn't recruited for the militia. He assigns Scott the task of betraying the others, if he breaks Pedro's finger to prove his loyalty. Scott, drugged and weary, does so. But later when he meets Pedro he is shocked by his action. He telepathically forces Jonas to break his own finger and they leave. But Mount Vesuvius erupts and all but destroys Naples. Pedro only gets on a ship through a servant named Giovanni who saves him, but Pedro has to swim through human sewage to get out of the castle where he and Scott were imprisoned. En route to Rome, Pedro's ship is hit by a tsunami from the volcanic eruption but it survives. Then they get to the Vatican where Pedro meets a family called the Riveras, the son of whom, Silvio, is a cardinal who is in the Pope's circle, as well as part of the Pontifical Commission. Pedro sees the daughter, Maria, is sick with terminal pancreatic cancer and cures her with his powers. Silvio is disillusioned and dismayed at Pedro's power and tries to kill Pedro because \\"there can only be one Saviour\\" and it is not him, but Pedro saves himself by vomiting out the poison the priest used. Silvio dies, having poisoned himself for being unable to kill someone and live, but Pedro survives. He escapes and meets a good-hearted janitor called Leo Tasso who takes him to a door in the Vatican, which Pedro wants to use to get to Oblivion, the Old Ones' palace, in Antarctica. Meanwhile, Matt and Lohan have arrived in Brazil, and Matt is encouraging Lohan to sell him for money, and then steal him back. He sells him to a drug lord, rescues him, but then they both get wound up in mining gold whilst carrying out their plan again. Matt visits the dreamworld in the library where the Librarian gets the book of Matt's life out for him to read all the way through. Matt does and is shocked at his future which reveals him being betrayed, then tortured and killed. But he knows it is destiny so he goes along with it, knowing that it will work. First, he needs to get to Antarctica, and to do this, he needs to find one of the doors. However, unable to find a door in the gold mine, he and Lohan break out and steal a jet to take them there, despite Lohan wanting to go to the United States and then return to Asia. Scarlett and Richard have arrived in Egypt, and are rescued by Albert Remy, an agent of the Nexus, and they are taken to Tariq, a freedom fighter who is fighting against the Old Ones' chief servant in Egypt, Field Marshal Karim El-Akkad. Richard discovers that the children who were supposedly injured by El-Akkad's forces and are being treated in a Nexus-run hospital are child soldiers, used by Tariq to fight the ruling military. Sickened, Richard also discovers that the vehicle being used to escort him and Scarlett out of Egypt is equipped with explosives, in a plan to kill them and El-Akkad in the same attempt. He changes the license plates and other details of the bomb jeep with another, and he, Scarlett and Remy leave the fort, meeting a driver who is really El-Akkad. Tariq detonates the bomb, unaware of Richard's actions. Richard and Scarlett kill El-Akkad, but Remy is mortally wounded and dies soon after, on the road to Dubai. They bury him and take his wallet, before arriving at Dubai Airport and meeting First Officer Zack Martins, formerly of Emirates, now a buyer for the childish and insane Sheikh Rasheed. His captain, Larry Carter, stole some of Rasheed's treasure and is set to be executed. Richard creates a plan to break Larry out of prison, by going to Rasheed's favourite haunt: a casino. There, Scarlett bets the contents of Remy's wallet on roulette and wins, but Rasheed notices, disqualifies her, and invites her and Richard to his palace for dinner. During the meal, Rasheed plans to force Scarlett to marry him, threatening to kill Richard if she refuses. But Rasheed's wife helps them escape, with Larry, and they race back to the airport, taking off and heading to Antarctica. The twenty-five doors are locked with an unearthly power that kills whoever tries to work them. Scott works this out and manages to work a way round it. But first, the chairman of Nightrise wants him to betray Matt. He puts it as a choice between wealth or suffering. Then Scott summons Matt to Skua Bay, where the betrayal is carried out. The Old Ones come and take Matt and Richard. They crucify Matt and lacerate him and then summon Richard to say goodbye, before killing him in front of Matt, but Richard kills Matt with a magical Incan knife to end his pain. This not only sets the sky on fire but it causes a great earthquake that kills the chairman and many of the Old Ones' servants watching Matt's torture. Meanwhile, Scott is being beaten by Jonas, seeking revenge for earlier, as well as revealing that the Old Ones never wanted him, but Lohan kills Jonas. Scott opens the doors, but it kills him with the electrical power inside the lock. The Old Ones converge on Scarlett, Pedro and Richard, thinking this is their victory, and Chaos himself, the King of the Old Ones, appears. But Holly and Jamie arrive from London, having survived an attack by the giant spider, and soon afterwards, the version of Matt from the past and Flint, Scott's past form, arrive to fight Chaos. All the Five are together at last and they plunge their swords into Chaos, killing him. The ground splits open and a chasm into space is revealed into which a third gate forms and all the Old Ones are banished into it, as well as some nuclear missiles which the human resistance has unleashed. With evil gone, apparently for good, the Five leave for the dreamworld, their victory complete. They find the dreamworld is now full of colour and life. Richard, Holly and Lohan return to the resistance which is victorious and they set back home to England. Lohan goes off to the East looking for the Triads. Holly, Richard and the Traveller go to a new village and settle there. The world begins repairing itself and things begin to get better.

White Shield was first brewed by the Worthington Brewery in Burton upon Trent in 1829, principally for export to the British Empire. Worthington merged with local rival Bass in 1927, which was itself taken over by Coors in 2002. White Shield has won the CAMRA Champion Bottled Beer of Britain Gold award three times, more than any other beer.Champion Bottle-conditioned Beers  Production  The 1920s era White Shield logo, as depicted on a car White Shield is principally available as a bottle conditioned beer, although it has periodically been made available in cask-conditioned form. White Shield is brewed using pale malt and a small amount of crystal malt. The hops used are Challenger, Fuggles and Northdown. Different yeasts are used for primary and secondary fermentation. After primary fermentation, the beer is conditioned in bulk for three weeks. Once packaged, it is matured in the bottle for a month before being sent out for distribution. Molson Coors claim that the beer will continue to mature in the bottle for up to three years. Former White Shield brewer Steve Wellington described the product in 2011 as \\"pretty much unchanged since appearing first in 1829\\".  History  Worthington's White Shield Worthington launched East India Pale Ale, their first IPA, in 1829. It was exported to British expatriates across the Empire, mostly officers and civil servants, as the soldiers tended to drink porter, which was more affordable. The growth of the railway network allowed for increased distribution of the beer throughout the United Kingdom. The beer was brewed using the Burton Union system. The White Shield logo was introduced from the 1870s, and by the end of the nineteenth century the beer took on this name with drinkers. Worthington officially renamed their India Pale Ale \\"White Shield\\" from 1950. 92,000 barrels of White Shield were brewed in 1952‚Äì53. Bass announced that White Shield would be discontinued in 1961: it was unpopular with many publicans as it had to be stored at a certain temperature and could not be served chilled. Bass ultimately reversed their decision, but just 15,000 barrels were brewed in 1965. Bass lowered the alcohol content of the beer in 1967. White Shield found renewed popularity in the early 1970s as the demand for real ale grew, but lost this position as the availability of cask ale improved. Bass relocated production from Burton to their Hope & Anchor brewery in Sheffield in 1981, and the beer ceased to be brewed using the Burton Union method. Production in 1988 totalled 12,000 barrels. The Hope & Anchor brewery was closed down in 1992, and production was moved to Cape Hill in Birmingham, before production was contracted to King and Barnes of Sussex in 1998. By this time, production was down to just 1,000 barrels a year, and the beer's long-term survival was in doubt. The King and Barnes brewery closed down in 2000, and production moved to the Bass owned White Shield microbrewery in Burton upon Trent. In 2000 a total of 500 barrels were produced. In 2010, production was moved to the newly constructed William Worthington's Brewery, a microbrewery based at the National Brewery Centre in Burton. In 2012, increasing demand saw White Shield production moved to the main Coors brewery in Burton. Roger Protz reported that White Shield was the highest selling bottle conditioned beer in Britain in 2013. However in 2018 he suggested that distribution of the beer had declined.

This created that ‚Äòlight bulb‚Äô moment for me and helped set into motion what is now LivePerson.\\" LoCascio took LivePerson public in April 2000, with an IPO of $8 a share. As one of the last companies to go public before the crash, he took drastic measures in cutting staff and expenses to stay afloat after the market fell. \\"It was a terrible time, and we weren't celebrating, to say the least,\\" LoCascio said. \\"But it saved us.\\" During the worst of times, LoCascio lived out of his office space, sleeping on a couch that still sits in the LivePerson office today. The stock would eventually rebound, returning to its original stock price almost 10 years later, as LivePerson gained hold in the market being dubbed ‚Äúthe thriving alley survivor you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äù by Crain's New York. In 2011, LivePerson was named one of Fortune's 100 Fastest Growing Companies and one of Forbes‚Äô 25 Fastest Growing Tech Companies. LoCascio currently employs over 1,000 people worldwide, and credits his recruiting philosophy as a main element in the company's success. He looks for two things: skill and will. In an article for Inc Magazine, he wrote ‚ÄúThe most valuable employees are the ones that have more than the right skills for the job. They have the will to do the job with passion. On October 1, 2015, LoCascio rang the opening bell at NASDAQ to celebrate 20 years in business, and shared his vision for LivePerson‚Äôs future: creating a world without 1-800 numbers, a world without ever being put on hold. LoCascio is now one of the longest-standing technology founding CEOs and has been profiled in Forbes‚Äô series of Thought Leaders Changing the Business Landscape and The New York Times‚Äô Corner Office, and is the winner of the 2015 Smart CEO Circle of Excellence Award in Technology.  Philanthropy  Beyond his business, LoCascio is the founder of the Dream Big Foundation, which started in 2001. Its first program was FeedingNYC, a hunger-relief project which delivers thousands of boxed meals to sheltered families in need throughout New York City each Thanksgiving. FeedingNYC was launched during the aftermath of 9/11 in the hopes of making a difference within the local community. Since 2001, over 40,000 Thanksgiving meals have been delivered to families in need. In 2014 the Dream Big Foundation expanded and launched a new program that will fund, mentor and coach budding entrepreneurs from the Brownsville, Brooklyn community. The first entrepreneurs that the foundation is funding will open the Dream Big Entrepreneur Caf√© on 3 Belmont Ave, Brownsville, Brooklyn. In his Huffington Post column, LoCascio writes ‚ÄúProviding these budding entrepreneurs with those tools and resources to turn their idea into a successful business is the key to growing this community from the inside out, rather than becoming a casualty of gentrification. The caf√© is scheduled to open in Spring, 2016. This work earned him the title of \\"Person of the Day\\" by Huffington Post in 2010. Robert is also active in the arts and works closely with the Salon program of the Juilliard School. Personal life LoCascio married Clarissa Weidner in 2015.

A caching SAN adapter is used to accelerate the performance of applications across multiple clustered or virtualized servers and uses DRAM, NAND Flash or other memory technologies as the cache. The key requirement for the memory technology is that it is faster than the media storing the original copy of the data to ensure performance acceleration is achieved. A caching SAN adapter's cached data is not captive to the server which hosts the adapter and enables clustered enterprise servers to share the cache for fault tolerance and application performance acceleration. Server application transparency is a key attribute of a caching SAN adapter as it ensures caching benefits without additional changes to the operating system and application stacks that can adversely impact interoperability and latency. Caching SAN Adapters are a new, hybrid approach to server-based caching addresses the drawbacks of the traditional implementations. Rather than creating a discrete captive cache for each server, a Caching SAN Adapter uses a cache that is integrated with a Host Bus Adapter. The adapter uses a cache-coherent implementation that uses the existing SAN infrastructure to create a shared cache resource distributed over multiple physical servers. This capability eliminates the single-server limitation for caching and provides the performance benefits of cached-data acceleration to the high I/O demands of clustered applications and highly virtualized data center environments. A Caching SAN Adapter incorporates a class of host-based, intelligent I/O optimization engines that provide integrated storage network connectivity, storage capacity, and the embedded processing required to make all cache management entirely transparent to the host. The only host-resident software required for operation is a standard host operating system (OS) device driver. A Caching SAN Adapter appears to the host as a standard Host Bus Adapter and uses a common Host Bus Adapter driver. Caching SAN Adapters delivers something beyond that of server-based caching implementations: the ability to provide cluster caching for SAN adapters and then share their caches between servers. Clustering Caching SAN Adapters creates a logical group that delivers a single point of management and cooperates to maintain cache coherence, high availability, and allocation of cache resources. Unlike standard Host Bus Adapters, Caching SAN Adapters communicate with each other as both initiators and targets, using the Fibre Channel or similar storage networking infrastructure. This communication allows the Caching SAN Adapter cluster to share and manage caches across multiple server nodes. This distributed cache model enables a single copy of cache data, which ensures coherent cache operation, maximizes the use of caching resources, simplifies the architecture, and increases scalability. History The caching SAN adapter in the enterprise server is a hybrid of two widely used technologies: the SAN HBA and cached memory. SAN HBAs provide server access to a high-speed network of consolidated storage devices. Cached memory has had two primary implementations: DRAM modules and NAND Flash in the form of a Solid State Drive (SSD). DRAM cache is used primarily at the CPU level and offers the highest levels of performance. Due to its high cost per gigabyte (GB) and volatility, DRAM cache has not been used extensively to accelerate larger data sets. SSD caching has gained popularity in recent years and typically comes in a drive, PCIe or other form factor. SSD cache offers an exceptional performance boost to server operations but is captive to the server in which it is contained. Typically, a single server SSD residing in a physical server is not sharable with other servers within a clustered environment. Furthermore, SSD caches lack transparency requiring caching software, special operating system drivers and other changes to make applications aware the cache is available for utilization. Future Caching SAN adapter platforms are available now that utilize server-based NAND flash technology as the cache and Fibre Channel as the server-to-storage interconnect. This configuration enables clustered servers to share cached data. There are new caching SAN adapter technologies in development that will expand utilization to other server-to-storage communication methodologies including Ethernet-based iSCSI and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).

Campbell is composed of coordinating groups that coordinate the production of systematic reviews and evidence gap maps in the following areas: Business & Management, Climate Solutions, Crime & Justice, Disability, Education, International Development, Knowledge Translation & Implementation, Methods, and Social Welfare. It is a sister initiative of Cochrane, with secretariat staff in Oslo and New Delhi. Campbell reviews are published in Campbell Systematic Reviews, an open access journal committed to publishing systematic reviews as well as methods research papers, and evidence and gap maps. History The Campbell Collaboration was created as a result of a perceived need for an organization that would produce reviews of the evidence on the effectiveness of social interventions. An exploratory meeting in London in 1999 led to the establishment of the Campbell Collaboration in 2000 and an inaugural meeting at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, United States, on 24‚Äì25 February 2000. The collaboration was named after the American psychologist Donald T. Campbell (1916-1996), a member of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. In December 2004, the American Psychological Association published an article on the work of the Campbell Collaboration. In May 2005, a special issue of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science was devoted to describing what the evidence-based approach of the Cochrane Collaboration and Campbell Collaboration had uncovered. The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) and the University of Ottawa established the International Development Coordinating Group (IDCG) in May 2011. There are two Campbell regional centres: Campbell UK & Ireland, established in 2016 and hosted at The Centre for Evidence and Social Innovation at Queen's University Belfast in the UK, and Campbell South Asia, established in New Delhi, India in 2019. Use by other organizations and policy influence Campbell reviews are used by organizations and policy- makers to inform decision-making based on research evidence. Charity evaluator and effective altruism advocate GiveWell had listed the Campbell Collaboration as one of its sources of information when trying to assess the state of evidence for various social policies and interventions in the United States and notes their value in determining susceptibility to publication bias of social programs. Campbell reviews have been used to inform policy implementation and guideline development in various countries.

He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft. He played college football at Indiana. He was a member of the Broncos in their Super Bowl 50 win against the Carolina Panthers and has been a member of the New York Giants and Washington Football Team. Early years Latimer attended Jefferson Township High School in Dayton, Ohio. He was a first team all-conference selection after hauling in 42 catches for 722 yards and six touchdowns in addition to 372 rushing yards, six touchdowns, and 27 carries in just eight games as a senior. On defense, he made 89 tackles, four interceptions (one score) and forced two fumbles. In addition to football, he played basketball, baseball, and ran track. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Latimer was rated as the 49th best wide receiver prospect of his class. College career Latimer attended Indiana University from 2011 to 2013. During his career, he started 24 of 32 games with 135 receptions for 2,042 yards and 17 touchdowns. He entered the 2014 NFL Draft after his junior season. Professional career =Denver Broncos= 2014 The Denver Broncos selected Latimer in the second round (56th overall) of the 2014 NFL Draft. He was the tenth wide receiver to be selected and was one of two Indiana Hoosiers in 2014. On June 2, 2014, the Denver Broncos signed Latimer to a four-year, $3.70 million contract that includes $2.02 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1.01 million. Throughout training camp, he competed for a job as the backup wide receiver against veterans Andre Caldwell and Jordan Norwood. Head coach John Fox named Latimer the fourth wide receiver on the depth chart to start the regular season after Wes Welker was suspended for the first four games after he failed a drug test for amphetamines and violated the NFL's performance enhancing substances policy and Jordan Norwood tore his ACL during training camp practice. He started the season behind Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, and Andre Caldwell. He made his professional regular season debut in the Denver Broncos' season-opening 31‚Äì24 victory against the Indianapolis Colts. Head coach John Fox elected to play Isaiah Burse for his added punt return capabilities and listed Latimer as a healthy scratch for five consecutive games (Weeks 2-7). In Week 10, Latimer caught his first career reception off of a nine-yard pass by quarterback Peyton Manning, as the Broncos routed the Oakland Raiders 41‚Äì17. He was listed as inactive the following week as the St. Louis Rams defeated the Broncos 22‚Äì17. On December 28, 2014, he caught a season-long 14-yard pass during a 47‚Äì14 win against the Oakland Raiders. He finished his rookie season with two receptions for 23 receiving yards and two kick returns for 22-yards in eight games and zero starts. Latimer stated he had issues digesting the playbook and took too long during his rookie season to adjust to the pro game. 2015 On January 12, 2015, the Denver Broncos and head coach John Fox agreed to mutually part ways after their 24‚Äì13 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Divisional round. On January 19, 2015, the Denver Broncos appointed former Baltimore Ravens' offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak as their new head coach. Latimer competed against Andre Caldwell and Jordan Norwood for role as the Broncos' third wide receiver after the Broncos opted to not re-sign Wes Welker. Head coach Gary Kubiak named Latimer the fifth wide receiver on the depth chart to start the regular season, behind Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, Andre Caldwell, and Jordan Norwood. In Week 10, Latimer caught a season-high three passes for 30 yards during Denver's 29‚Äì13 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. On November 22, 2015, he earned his first start and had two receptions for 22-yard and caught his first career touchdown on a ten-yard pass from Brock Osweiler as the Broncos defeated the Chicago Bears 17‚Äì15. He finished the season with six receptions for 59-yards and one touchdown in 14 games and one start. The Denver Broncos finished the season atop the AFC West with a 12-4 record and received a playoff berth. On January 17, 2016, Latimer appeared in his first career playoff game and caught two passes for 18-yards as the Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 23-16. After defeating the New England Patriots, the Denver Broncos went on to face the Panthers in the Super Bowl. On February 7, 2016, Latimer appeared in Super Bowl 50 with the Denver Broncos as they defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24‚Äì10. 2016 He entered training camp in 2016 and competed for the job as the third wide receiver against Jordan Norwood and Bennie Fowler. In the 2016 season, with new quarterbacks Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch, Latimer played in 12 games with one start recording eight receptions for 76 yards. Latimer also had a career- high seven solo tackles on special teams and returned eight kicks for 200-yards. 2017 Latimer finished his fourth season in 2017 with a career-high 19 receptions for 287 receiving yards and two touchdowns in 11 games. He also had eight kick returns for 190-yards. =New York Giants= Washington Redskins On March 19, 2018, Latimer signed with the New York Giants, reuniting with his former wide receivers coach, Tyke Tolbert. He was placed on injured reserve on October 16, 2018 after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 6. He was activated off injured reserve on December 19, 2018. In six games in the 2018 season, Latimer recorded 11 receptions for 190 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. Latimer re-signed with the team on March 22, 2019. In the 2019 season, Latimer appeared in 15 games and recorded 24 receptions for 300 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns. =Washington Football Team= Latimer signed with the Washington Football Team on April 7, 2020. He was placed on the commissioner's exempt list on July 27, 2020, following his May 2020 arrest.

Its name derives from source of the funding, petroleum exports, that spread it through the Muslim world after the Yom Kippur War. The term is sometimes called \\"pejorative\\" or a \\"nickname.\\" According to Sandra Mackey the term was coined by Fouad Ajami. It has been used by French political scientist Gilles Kepel, Bangladeshi religious scholar Imtiyaz Ahmed, and Egyptian philosopher Fouad Zakariyya, among others. Usage and definitions The use of the term to refer to \\"Wahhabism,\\" the dominant interpretation of Islam in Saudi Arabia, is widespread but not universal. Variations on or different uses of the term include: *Use of resources by Saudi Arabia \\"to project itself as a major player in the Muslim world\\": the distribution of large sums of money from public and private sources in Saudi Arabia to advance Wahhabi doctrines and pursue the Saudi Arabian foreign policy. * Attempts by the Saudi rulers to use both Islam and its wealth to win the loyalty of the Muslim world. * Diplomatic, political, economic, and religious policies promoted by Saudi Arabia. *The type of Islam favored by petroleum-exporting Muslim-majority countries, particularly the other Gulf monarchies (United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, etc.), not just Saudi Arabia. *A \\"hugely successful\\" enterprise made up of a \\"colossal ensemble\\" of media and other cultural organs that has broken the \\"secularist and nationalist\\" monopoly of the state on culture, media and, \\"to a lesser extent,\\" education; and is supported by both Islamists and socially conservative business \\"elements,\\" who opposed the Arab nationalist ideologies of Nasserism and Baathism. *More conservative Islamic cultural practices (separation of the sexes, wearing of the hijab or a more complete hijab) brought back (to Egypt) from Gulf oil states by migrant workers. *A term used by secularists, particularly in Egypt, to refer to efforts to require the enforcement of sharia (Islamic law). *An Islamic interpretation that is \\"anti-woman, anti- intellectual, anti-progress, and anti-science... largely funded by the Saudis and Kuwaitis.\\"(quoted in Lifting the Veil: The World of Muslim Women) Background thumb October 1973 War, after the Iranian Revolution (1980), and during the market turnaround in 1986.Ian Skeet, OPEC: Twenty-Five Years of Prices and Politics (Cambridge: University Press, 1988) Iran and Iraq are excluded because their revenue fluctuated due to the revolution and the war between them. One scholar who spelled out the idea of petro-Islam in some detail is Gilles Kepel.quoted in a number of sourcesBooks quoting Kepel on Petro-Islam include A Choice of Enemies: America Confronts the Middle East By Sir Lawrence Freedman; Life among the Anthros and Other Essays By Clifford Geertz; According to Kepel, prior to the 1973 oil embargo, religion throughout the Muslim world was \\"dominated by national or local traditions rooted in the piety of the common people.\\" Clerics looked to their different schools of fiqh (the four Sunni Madhhabs: Hanafi in the Turkish zones of South Asia, Maliki in Africa, Shafi'i in Southeast Asia, plus Shi'a Ja'fari, and \\"held Saudi inspired puritanism\\" (using another school of fiqh, Hanbali) in \\"great suspicion on account of its sectarian character,\\" according to Gilles Kepel. While the 1973 War (also called the Yom Kippur War) was started by Egypt and Syria to take back land won by Israel in 1967, the \\"real victors\\" of the war were the Arab \\"oil-exporting countries,\\" (according to Gilles Kepel), whose embargo against Israel's western allies stopped Israel's counter offensive. The embargo's political success enhanced the prestige of those who embargoed and the reduction in the global supply of oil sent oil prices soaring (from $3 per barrel to nearly $12) and with them, oil exporter revenues. That put Muslim oil exporting states in a \\"clear position of dominance within the Muslim world.\\" The most dominant was Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter by far (see bar chart). Saudi Arabians viewed their oil wealth not as an accident of geology or history but connected to religion, a blessing by God of them, to \\"be solemnly acknowledged and lived up to\\" with pious behavior.Gilles Kepel and Nazih N. Ayubi both use the term Petro-Islam, but others subscribe to this view as well, example: With its new wealth the rulers of Saudi Arabia sought to replace nationalist movements in the Muslim world with Islam, to bring Islam \\"to the forefront of the international scene,\\" and to unify Islam worldwide under the \\"single creed\\" of Wahhabism, paying particular attention to Muslims who had immigrated to the West (a \\"special target\\"). Influence of \\"Petro-dollars\\" According to scholar Gilles Kepel, (who devoted a chapter of his book Jihad to the subject -- \\"Building Petro-Islam on the Ruins of Arab Nationalism\\"), in the years immediately after the 1973 War, 'petro-Islam' was a \\"sort of nickname\\" for a \\"constituency\\" of Wahhabi preachers and Muslim intellectuals who promoted \\"strict implementation of the sharia [Islamic law] in the political, moral and cultural spheres.\\" In the coming decades, Saudi Arabia's interpretation of Islam became influential (according to Kepel) through *the spread of Wahhabi religious doctrines via Saudi charities; an *increased migration of Muslims to work in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states; and *a shift in the balance of power among Muslim states toward the oil-producing countries. Author Sandra Mackey describes the use of petrodollars on facilities for the hajj such as by leveling hill peaks to make room for tents, providing electricity for tents and cooling pilgrims with ice and air conditioning, as part of \\"Petro-Islam,\\" which she describes as a way of building the Muslim faithful's loyalty toward the Saudi government.Kepel describes Saudi control of the two holy cities as \\"an essential instrument of hegemony over Islam.\\" =Religious funding= The Saudi ministry for religious affairs printed and distributed millions of Qurans free of charge, along with doctrinal texts that followed the Wahhabi interpretation. In mosques throughout the world \\"from the African plains to the rice paddies of Indonesia and the Muslim immigrant high-rise housing projects of European cities, the same books could be found,\\" paid for by Saudi Arabian government. Imtiyaz Ahmed, a religious scholar and professor of International Relations at University of Dhaka sees changes in religious practices in Bangladesh as linked to Saudi Arabia's efforts to promote Wahhabism through the financial help it provides countries like Bangladesh. The Mawlid, the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs birthday and formerly \\"an integral part of Bangladeshi culture\\" is no longer popular, while black burqas for women are much more so. The discount on the price of oil imports Bangladesh receives does not \\"come free,\\" according to Ahmed. \\"Saudi Arabia is giving oil, Saudi Arabia would definitely want that some of their ideas to come with oil.\\" Mosques Pakistan's Faisal Mosque, a gift from Saudi Arabia's King Faisal More than 1,500 mosques were built around the world from 1975 to 2000 paid for by Saudi public funds. The Saudi-headquartered and financed Muslim World League played a pioneering role in supporting Islamic associations, mosques, and investment plans for the future. It opened offices in \\"every area of the world where Muslims lived.\\" The process of financing mosques usually involved presenting a local office of the Muslim World League with evidence of the need for a mosque/Islamic center to obtain the offices 'recommendation' (tazkiya) to \\"a generous donor within the kingdom or one of the emirates.\\" Saudi-financed mosques were generally built using marble 'international style' design and green neon lighting, in a break with most local Islamic architectural traditions, but following Wahhabi ones. =Islamic banking= One mechanism for the redistribution of (some) oil revenues from Saudi Arabia and other Muslim oil-exporters, to the poorer Muslim nations of African and Asia, was the Islamic Development Bank. Headquartered in Saudi Arabia, it opened for business in 1975. Its lenders and borrowers were member states of Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and it strengthened \\"Islamic cohesion\\" between them. Saudi Arabians also helped establish Islamic banks with private investors and depositors. DMI (Dar al-Mal al-Islami: the House of Islamic Finance), founded in 1981 by Prince Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud,son of the assassinated King Faisal and the Al Baraka group, established in 1982 by Sheik Saleh Abdullah Kamel (a Saudi billionaire), were both transnational holding companies. =Migration= By 1975, over one million workers, from unskilled country people to experienced professors - from Sudan, Pakistan, India, Southeast Asia, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon and Syria - had moved to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states to work and returned after a few years with savings. Most of the workers were Arab and most were Muslim. Ten years later the number had increased to 5.15 million and Arabs were no longer in the majority. 43% (mostly Muslims) came from the Indian subcontinent. In one country, Pakistan, in a single year, (1983), > \\"the money sent home by Gulf emigrants amounted to $3 billion, compared with > a total of $735 million given to the nation in foreign aid.... The underpaid > petty functionary of yore could now drive back to his hometown at the wheel > of a foreign car, build himself a house in a residential suburb, and settle > down to invest his savings or engage in trade... he owed nothing to his home > state, where he could never have earned enough to afford such luxuries.\\" Muslims who had moved to Saudi Arabia, or other \\"oil-rich monarchies of the peninsula\\" to work, often returned to their poor home country following religious practice more intensely, particularly practices of Wahhabi Muslims. Having \\"grown rich in this Wahhabi milieu,\\" it was not surprising that the returning Muslims believed that there was a connection between that milieu and \\"their material prosperity\\" and that when they returned, they followed religious practices more intensely, which followed Wahhabi tenants. Kepel gives examples of migrant workers returning home with new affluence, asking to be addressed by servants as \\"hajja\\" rather than \\"Madame\\" (the old bourgeois custom). Another imitation of Saudi Arabia adopted by affluent migrant workers was increased segregation of the sexes, including shopping areas.examples include residential areas built to \\"house members of the devoutly Islamic business class who have returned from the Gulf,\\" in Medinet Nasr district of Cairo; and Al Salam Shopping Centers Li-l Mouhaggabat that specialized in \\"providing shopping facilities for veiled women.\\" (Kepel, Jihad, 2002, 385) =State leadership= In the 1950s and 1960s Gamal Abdul-Nasser, the leading exponent of Arab nationalism and the president of the Arab world's largest country had great prestige and popularity. However, in 1967 Nasser led the Six-Day War against Israel which ended not in the elimination of Israel but in the decisive defeat of the Arab forces and loss of a substantial chunk of Egyptian territory. This defeat, combined with the economic stagnation from which Egypt suffered, were contrasted with the perceived victory of the October 1973 war whose pious battle cry of Allahu Akbar replaced \\"Land! Sea! Air!\\" slogan of the 1967 war, Wright, Sacred Rage, (p.64-7) and with the enormous wealth of the resolutely non-nationalist Saudi Arabia. This changed \\"the balance of power among Muslim states\\" toward Saudi Arabia and other oil- exporting countries. gaining as Egypt lost influence. The oil-exporters emphasized \\"religious commonality\\" among Arabs, Turks, Africans, and Asians, and downplayed \\"differences of language, ethnicity, and nationality.\\" The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, whose permanent Secretariat is located in Jeddah in Western Saudi Arabia, was founded after the 1967 war. Criticism At least one observer, The New Yorker magazine's investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, has suggested that petro-Islam is being spread by those whose motivations are less than earnest or pious.(writing in the New Yorker magazine and quoted by Indian lawyer Menaka Guruswamy, in an article in The Hindu newspaper which in turn was quoted by BBC Monitoring South Asia) Petro-Islam funding following the Gulf War, according to Hersh, \\"amounts to protection money\\" from the Saudi regime \\"to fundamentalist groups that wish to overthrow it.\\" Egyptian existentialist Fouad Zakariyya has accused purveyors of Petro- Islam as having as their objective the protection of the oil wealth and \\"social relations\\" of the \\"tribal societies that possess the lion's share of this wealth,\\" at the expense of the long-term development of the region and the majority of its people.(link has been messed with to prevent blocking) He further states that it is a \\"brand of Islam\\" that bills itself as \\"pure\\" but rather than being the Islam of the early Muslims has \\"never\\" been \\"seen before in history.\\" Authors who criticize the \\"thesis\\" of Petro-Islam itself (that petrodollars have had a significant effect on Muslim beliefs and practices) include Joel Beinin and Joe Stork. They argue that in Egypt, Sudan and Jordan, \\"Islamic movements have demonstrated a high level of autonomy from their original patrons.\\" The strength and growth of Muslim Brotherhood and other forces of conservative political Islam in Egypt can be explained, according to Beinin and Stork, by internal forces: the historical strength of the Muslim Brotherhood, sympathy for the \\"martyred\\" Sayyid Qutb, anger with the \\"autocratic tendencies\\" and the failed promises of prosperity of the Sadat government.

His most notable works include The Origin of Life and The Marriage Guide, both of which focus on teaching healthy sexual practices and behavior, as well as proper knowledge of the reproductive processes and management of diseases. Hollick‚Äôs beliefs were controversial for the time period since many health professionals at this time were against discussing sex and functions of the human body in a public sphere.  Teachings  An award given to Frederick Hollick by the Ladies Association of Philadelphia in appreciation of his frank lectures Unlike other doctors during the mid-19th century, Hollick‚Äôs mission was to bring sexual health and sex education to the public. He was determined to educate society about the proper anatomical functions of the human body in relation to sexual pleasure. He strongly believed it was of the utmost importance that humans knew all they could about human generation, a subject highly neglected and only newly understood by the medical community,Origin of Life (1878), p. 12 and that it was unhealthy for people to be ignorant of their sexual awareness. Prior to the release of his 1860 health manual The Marriage Guide, which openly discussed such things as the benefits of aphrodisiacs, legal prostitution, and multiple orgasms in females, people were rarely exposed to such information. Instead, they relied primarily on the private education they received from their family doctor, many of whom were adamant about not relaying such scandalous beliefs. Hollick was critical of the medical industry's attitude towards sex, claiming that doctors left it as a \\"professional mystery\\". Much to his peers' dismay, Hollick went beyond writing sexual health manuals by holding frequent lectures and demonstrations in Philadelphia to spread his beliefs. Using a papier-m√¢ch√© recreation of the female body as a guide, Hollick taught audiences where female sexual organs were located and how they should properly be used during sex. Although audiences were initially shocked at seeing such a lifelike representation of a naked woman, many women were grateful for such an informational display at a time when female sexual pleasure was deemed non- existent and little knowledge of how female sexual organs function was actually known. In addition, Hollick advocated heavily for the physiological necessity of sex in consenting adults, regardless of marital status. He insisted that sex was an organic expression of human nature, citing the act as \\"...the highest and most absorbing excitement that animated beings can experience\\".quoted from Marriage Guide While his lectures created a fairly large following, they also garnered an even greater opposition. = Controversial beliefs = Despite the myriad of praise from newly informed audiences and liberated women on the acceptance and naturalness of sex, several of Hollick's personal opinions were still quite conservative, mirroring those of other doctors in his field. Firm opposition toward masturbation, homosexuality, celibacy, and interracial relations was upheld by Hollick, practices which he deemed \\"unhealthful\\" and even physiologically dangerous. The consequences from engaging in such behavior ranged from impotence in men to venereal diseases and even death‚Äîfortunately all of which Hollick knew cures for. Some of his \\"home remedies\\" for impotence, for instance, included the use of Cannabis indica (marijuana), a deep tissue groin massage/shampoo, or a suctioning machine of Hollick's own creation, which he claimed was able to bring back an erection to any dysfunctional man.  Obscenity trials  Although several of Hollick‚Äôs views merited similarities among his colleagues, it was not enough to sway them into approving of his overall methodology. Thus, beginning in 1846, Hollick was condemned by his Antebellum peers to multiple charges of obscenity, leading to two trials, the second of which he failed to show up for. The charges insisted that both Hollick‚Äôs papier-m√¢ch√© mannequin and the distribution of anatomically correct diagrams of sex organs were obscene, edging on pornographic. However, the first charges were eventually dropped due to witnesses dismissal of the mannequin as obscene, but rather informational, which only reaffirmed the widely held belief that Hollick‚Äôs teachings provided a fresh, welcoming view of sex.April Haynes: The Trials of Frederick Hollick. Obscenity, Sex Education, and Medical Democracy in the Antebellum United States. Journal of the History of Sexuality, 12.4, 2003, pp. 543-574 Even though charges still remained against Hollick, the rising support by his followers pushed him to forfeit the bail, leave Philadelphia behind, and begin a new life in New York to share his teachings with receptive audiences alike. There is little information about what happened to Doctor Hollick after he fled the district court's charges against him, other than his death in 1900, and his permanent influence on views about sex throughout the 19th century.

It was published in Wilcannia until 1940, when it moved to Broken Hill.  Newspaper history  Wilcannia's first newspaper was the Wilcannia Times, a bi-weekly founded in 1873 by William Webb (March 1848 ‚Äì 15 November 1910), and ceased publication in 1888. The Western Grazier was established on 2 December 1880 by James Smith Reid. Reid was an Irish printer-journalist who had previously established several mining journals in Queensland, including The Miner in Charters Towers and Thornborough. After the establishment of The Western Grazier Reid went on to in Silverton, where he founded the bi-weekly Silver Age, whose printing presses were used to print the first prospectus of BHP. Reid and his brothers were to amass considerable wealth from their mining interests. In 1886, Thomas William Heney became editor of The Western Grazier, a position he held for three years. The first issue which is available to the public via Trove is dated Wednesday, 1 January 1896, is listed as Volume XVII No, 1571 and consisted of 4 pages, priced 3d., at which time the paper was published twice weekly; on Saturday and Wednesday by Albert John Esau (1863 ‚Äì 24 December 1940). Esau, son of Dr. Esau of Woodside, South Australia, purchased the Western Grazier around 1891 and until 1897 was solely responsible for the paper's production and distribution, then took on Thomas Henry Bell as assistant. It was in that year that Esau was successfully sued for libel. Esau subsequently was proprietor of the Armidale Chronicle, where in 1899 he attracted another libel suit, which was settled out of court. In 1905 he founded the Corowa Chronicle, which he ran for around 23 years, and was involved in many other regional newspapers. He later had a stationery shop in Singleton, New South Wales where he became insolvent in 1937. He died in Adelaide at the end of 1940 after being struck by a tram. Thomas Henry Bell took over publication of the paper in October 1898, and ran it for 14 years, during which time it became a weekly, published on Saturday, with the price doubled to 6d. Bell was succeeded in 1900 by John Atkinson (ca.1857 ‚Äì 16 February 1923), who had returned to Wilcannia in 1899 to take charge of the Lion Brewery, and was dubbed the \\"Pooh Bah of Wilcannia\\" for the way he entered into all facets of the town's life. Editorship passed to longtime employee of the Western Grazier, Robert Varcoe \\"Bob\\" Patterson (ca.1863 ‚Äì 2 October 1939) 1n 1909, but continued as proprietor until 1911, when ownership passed to Lewis Downs (ca.1860 ‚Äì 8 February 1943), a businessman (partner in Knox & Downs) and accountant in Wilcannia. Patterson (who, unlike Esau, was constitutionally unable to say or write anything that might be hurtful to others) became proprietor a few years later. With the coming of railways and improved roads and motor vehicles, the Murray-Darling's importance as a conduit for wool and wheat, and Wilcannia's importance as a river port, declined dramatically and its population slumped. The Depression contributed to a drop in readership and nearly led to the paper's demise in 1933. On Patterson's death, ownership of the Grazier passed to Michael Hayes (publisher) and G. Lawrence (financial backing). Their partnership was dissolved in October 1940, leaving Hayes the sole owner. Lawrence regained ownership in 1941 and arranged with Ernest Wetherell of Broken Hill's Barrier Daily Truth to take over the printing and distribution of Western Grazier, with J. Brand as the Wilcannia editor. Day of publication moved from Saturday to Friday; the cover price remained unchanged at 6d. With the war providing fresh headlines every day, and with most families personally involved, newspaper sales picked up dramatically. Post-war shortages combined with local factors to make the newspaper unprofitable and the newspaper ceased publication on 29 June 1951.  Digitisation  Issues of the paper from 1 January 1896 have been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program project of the National Library of Australia.

Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Philippines in mid-August 1985, the system gradually became better organized, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on August 16\\\\. It continued to deepen, and late on August 17, Mamie attained typhoon intensity. Around this time, Typhoon Mamie reached its peak intensity of , which it maintained for 12 hours. After making landfall in Shanghai, the storm steadily weakened. However, after turning north and crossing the Shanghai Peninsula and the Yellow Sea, Mamie made a second landfall near Yantai as a tropical storm. After turning northwest and re-entering the Yellow Sea, Mamie moved ashore for the third and final time near Dairen. On August 21, Mamie dissipated inland over northeastern China. Due to both Mamie and Nelson, widespread flooding was reported across much of northern China, with 19 rivers overflowing. The typhoon forced around 1,000 factories to temporarily close, and toppled approximately 6.5 million trees. Moreover, about 8,000 homes were flooded and 120,000 houses received damage Nearly 1 million people were directly affected by the typhoon. The typhoon killed more than 120,000 animals and sank more than 200 boats. Overall, 17 fatalities occurred and 165 were injured. Losses totaled $172 million (1985 USD). Meteorological history Typhoon Mamie originated from the southwesterly monsoonal flow near the Philippines. The monsoon flow was situated near Tropical Storm Lee, which was situated east of Taiwan at that time. At 0000 UTC on August 14, banding features were noted via satellite imagery. The system was first monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 0600 UTC on August 14; the JTWC noted that the chances of significant development were poor. Throughout the day, the system became better organized while turning north and at 1800 UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the disturbance. Early on August 15, the JTWC remarked that the storm had a \\"fair\\" chance at potential development. As such, Hurricane Hunter aircraft was requested. Following an increase in banding features and outflow, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the JTWC that afternoon. Thereafter, the cyclone began to strengthen as interaction with Tropical Storm Lee diminished. At 2300 UTC on August 15, the aircraft discovered a closed low-level circulation, as well as tropical storm-force winds. Based on this, both agencies designated the system as Tropical Storm Mamie early on August 16. On August 16, the tropical storm began to turn northwest in response to the strengthening of a subtropical ridge north of Mamie and a westward-moving mid-latitude cyclone. At 0000 UTC on August 17, the JTWC classified Mamie as a typhoon while the JMA reported winds of , a severe tropical storm. Around midday, the JTWC estimated winds of , equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. However, the aforementioned ridge was not strong enough to prevent the storm from turning north-northwest on August 17. That evening, the JMA upgraded Mamie to typhoon status. Simultaneously, the JMA estimated peak winds of , and a minimum barometric pressure of . According to the JMA, the typhoon held on to peak intensity for 12 hours while moving onshore near Shanghai on August 18. Mamie only gradually weakened overland, but according to the JMA, the storm's winds had decreased to midday on August 18. Typhoon Mamie moved offshore at 0200 UTC on August 19; subsequently, the JTWC estimated winds of while the JMA estimated winds of . After crossing the Shanghai Peninsula, Mamie entered the Yellow Sea while turning north along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, and at 0600 UTC, struck Yantai as a minimal tropical storm. Following a turn towards the northwest, Tropical Storm Mamie briefly emerged into the Yellow Sea before making a third and final landfall just west of Dairen at noon. At the time of landfall, both the JMA and the JTWC reported winds of . Due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of China, Mamie began to dissipate over land, and by 0000 UTC on August 20, the JTWC ceased watching the cyclone. The JMA followed suit 42 hours later. Preparations, impact, and aftermath Roughly 24 hours prior to Mamie's third landfall, all ships were warned in the port of Dalian to evacuate; however, 152 ships stayed at the port. Shortly after making landfall, Mamie was considered the worst storm to affect northeastern China in 26 years. The nation was already inundated by significant flooding earlier in the summer of 1985, especially from Typhoon Nelson. After making landfall, Typhoon Mamie dropped of rain in Liaoning, where the storm flooded of farmland. Due to a combination of Mamie and previous flooding, 19 rivers overflowed. The typhoon forced 1,000 factories to temporarily close, and toppled about 6.5 million trees. Over 8,000 dwellings were flooded. More than 3,000 residents were evacuated in the Jilin province. At least 36,400 villagers necessitated rescue. Nearly 1 million individuals were directly affected by the typhoon. Elsewhere, in Yantai, the typhoon killed more than 120,000 animals, damaged 120,000 homes, and sank more than 200 boats. Waves up to in height pounded the Bohai Bay shoreline, forcing more than 200 ships to be evacuated. Cables securing an oil rig were snapped. One person died while trying to fasten steel products on a ship. In all, 17 people perished and 165 were injured due to Mamie. Loses totaled $172 million. After the passage of Typhoon Mamie, more than 800,000 civilians and 9,000 soldiers were organized in order to protect reservoirs from flooding. By August 28, 150,000 civilians and 10,000 soldiers were fighting against flooding along the Liao River on a daily basis. Additionally, local military forces were called in to assist relief workers. The government organized buses and boats to carry flood victims. Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.

She was the 2005 winner of the Selma Lagerl√∂f Prize. Life Birgitta Stenberg was born in Stockholm in 1932. She was educated in Visby and finally in Paris. Stenberg spent a lot of time in southern Europe improving her language skills.Birgitta Stenberg , norstedts.se, retrieved 3 April 2014 In the early 1950s, she lived in Paris, Rome and on the French Rivera, experiences that inspired her book, K√§rlek i Europa (Love in Europe), which detailed her various sexual adventures.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.336 The book was later translated into English as Manplay in Europe. For a time, she was the mistress of the Mafiosi Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, who had been deported from the United States back to his native Italy.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.336 Stenberg had offered a job in New York by a travel agent who additionally added in a promise of a layover in Buenos Aires where she was to work temporarily as a model before going on to New York.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.336 The Mafiosi Luciano, who knew much about the Italian underworld told her that the travel agent was a white slaver and if she went to Buenos Aires, she would be forced to work in a brothel instead of the promised modeling job.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.336 Through Luciano Stenberg met his friend, the exiled King Farouk of Egypt, who was living in Italy and whose mistress she ultimately became.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.337 Luciano had grown up in New York, having left Sicily at the age of 9, and found Naples, where he lived, to be a rather \\"foreign\\" place, causing him to regard himself as being in exile from America. The common feeling of exile had caused Luciano to bond with Farouk. At her first date with Farouk in an expensive Roman restaurant, she was impressed by Farouk's \\"sweet eyes\\" together with the aura of power as the king wore an expensive suit while being surrounded by his bodyguards who silently tended to his every need.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.336-337 Farouk told her that he liked because her blond hair and large breasts together with her age reminded of his second wife, the teenager Queen Narriman who likewise had blond hair and large breasts.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.337 After following Farouk into exile in July 1952, Narriman had returned to Egypt in March 1953. Whenever she went out with the king, his burly Albanian bodyguards were always on hand to seize the cameras from any paparazzi, a task that they performed with much efficiency as they roughed up several paparazzi who tried to take photographs of the king with his latest mistress.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.337 Farouk told her that this was cheaper than having to bribe newspaper editors from publishing any of the photographs the paparazzi might take of him.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.337 Stenberg wrote about sex with Farouk: \\"I'm doing this with the king of twenty million people. This nice fat man was one of the world's symbols of power\\".Steadiem, William Too Rich p.337 She described the king as very sexually aggressive, but in common with his other mistresses complained he had an abnormally small penis.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.33-338 Stenberg lived in a Rome apartment with a gay American couple, which enraged the homophobic Farouk as he called her roommates \\"perverts\\" once he learned that the two men were more than just friends.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.337 In the face of his rage, Stenberg did not dare tell Farouk that she was bi-sexual, fearing that would upset him even more. At Farouk's insistence, she moved into the Villa Dusemt that he rented outside of Rome to get her away from her \\"pervert\\" gay American friends.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.337 She found the Villa Dusmet dark, gloomy and claustrophobic with the king's Albanian bodyguards imposing tight restrictions on where she could go while outside she always heard the barking of the guard dogs that were set loose on the grounds of the Villa Dusmet.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.339 She also found the king's jokes painfully unfunny such as: \\"Have you heard what one palm tree said to the other? Let's make a date\\".Steadiem, William Too Rich p.338 Eventually, she tired of Farouk and despite his gift of an expensive diamond bracelet ended the affair.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.339 Stenberg told Farouk \\"I'll miss you and life with you\\", leading the king to sadly say \\"Do you think it's something to miss\\".Steadiem, William Too Rich p.340 Stenberg reflected that she could not answer that question.Steadiem, William Too Rich p.340 She became a Swedish author, translator and illustrator. Stenberg was, during the early 1950s, a part of the literary assembly Metamorfosgruppen. She wrote the script for the film Raskenstam. During the Cold War in the 1950s, Stenberg was named secretary of the Swedish department of the Congress for Cultural Freedom and editor for Kulturkontakt which was founded by the CIA under the cover name of Ford Foundation. Stenberg's first novel Fritt f√∂rfall was refused by Bonnier Group in 1952 due to the novels \\"lack of literary quality\\". According to the authour herself, the publishing house was put off by the novels controversial lesbian motive. The novel was published in 2008 by Normal publishers. Stenberg later wrote an autobiographical suit that deals with sex, drugs and art making, starting with K√§rlek i Europa in 1981 and continuing with Apelsinmannen (1983), Spanska trappan (1987) and Alla vilda (2004). In 2009, she argued for the legalization of cannabis during the live studio news show Rapport. Stenberg's first published novel was Mikael och Poeten in 1956. The novel dealt with the Kejne Affair, a topic that is further explored in the later work Apelsinmannen. She worked at the radio interception at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, as a journalist at the magazine Arbetaren (The Worker), as an interpreter, fisherman and local politician for the Left Party.

It is based on the AK-74 and offers a high degree of parts commonality with the AK-74. The gun is directly developed from the PP-19 Bizon. It is the standard submachine gun for all branches of the Russian military and police forces. \\"Vityaz\\" (–≤–∏—Ç—è–∑—å) is Russian for \\"knight\\". Design details The PP-19 Vityaz at Interpolitex 2013 The PP-19 Vityaz is a selective fire submachine gun that uses a simple closed bolt, straight blowback method of operation. As such, it has no gas system and the internal components have been modified accordingly. The bolt carrier with integral charging handle is similar to AK-family, however the piston rod and rotary bolt were removed and the piston extension was plugged with a steel insert. The return spring and guide rod are almost identical to those of the AK-family. The PP-19 Vityaz has a four-groove barrel with a 240 mm (1:9 in) right-hand rifling pitch. It is chambered for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge and will also fire the new high-pressure armour-piercing 7N31 round that can penetrate soft body armour. The gun is fed from a 30-round box magazine and comes with a fastening device that joins two magazines together. Its muzzle brake has three small rectangular ports on each side that serve to reduce muzzle rise, however their main purpose is to protect the muzzle from damage. It can be equipped with a detachable sound suppressor. The PP-19 Vityaz shares the same trigger and safety mechanisms as the AK-74 rifle. The selector lever is placed on the right side of the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost \\"safe\\" setting disables the trigger and physically blocks the charging handle; the middle position (marked \\"–ê–í\\") enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position (\\"–û–î\\") activates the semi-automatic function of the trigger. It utilises the AKS-74 shoulder stock, which folds to the left side of the receiver. The pistol grip is identical to the grip of the AK-100 series and is made of a black fiberglass-reinforced polyamide. The forearm has attachment points for laser target designator, tactical flashlight and fore grip. The PP-19 Vityaz is provided with two types of rail system for mounting various optical or collimator sights. A Picatinny rail on top of the receiver or a dove-tail side rail, and it also has the standard AK-type front and rear sights.  Variants  = PPK-20 = PPK-20 is a modernised variant of the PP-19 Vityaz, developed and manufactured by Kalashnikov Concern. =KP-9= In the United States, Kalashnikov USA (not associated with the Kalashnikov Concern) manufactures a clone called the KP-9.

The groups administration and financial structure is completely separate from that of the football club, which allows the group to fully dedicate themselves to the interest of the clubs' supporters without there being any conflict of interest. The group is particularly dedicated to preserving the Ajax traditions, taking a stand on topics such as the club appearance, the integration of youth players and have been particularly aggressive in the restoration of the former Ajax logo. Together with the SVA (Supportersvereniging Ajax), the organization has officially been recognized by Ajax as the clubs' second supporters group, since their integration into the supporters structure in 2006. History Founded on 31 August 1999 as the Onafhankelijke Fanclub Ajax (OFA) the fan club became an official supporters club of AFC Ajax on 10 October 2006, after the group merged with the Ajax Supporters Delegatie (ASD) to form the AFCA Supportersclub after representatives of the group attended a board meeting that same day. The newly formed AFCA Supportersclub would give the club supporters a more solid ground from which to express their views and an organization to discuss matters of interest pertaining to both parties, such as the collective influence surrounding the atmosphere in the Stadium during home matches. With a reported 42,000 members the Supportersclub hold a degree of influence in matters pertaining to the club, and were even able to introduce honorary club member Ronald Pieloor as an official member of the board at AFC Ajax, giving the group a voice to address the supporters needs within the scope of actual team affairs. OFA logo (1999-2006) Supporters Advisory Committee The Supporters Advisory Committee (SAC) (Dutch: Supporters Advies Commissie) is an initiative by Axios, the AFCA Supportersclub and the SVA (Supportersvereniging Ajax). The committee provide advise and support in disputes with the KNVB, if one has been wrongfully banned from a Stadium due to past incidences, the SAC can help to provide a neutral standpoint without being affected by the outcome. Many supporters are often overwhelmed by the many rules and regulations of the ruling committee over football in the Netherlands, and the SAC help to bring clarity to any given situation. Supporters who have been banned can appeal the ban with the aid of the AFCA according to the KNVB Guidelines for Stadium bans '13/'14, after sufficient support has been provided and the supporter has expressed his remorse regarding previous actions, the SAC will then testify to AFC Ajax who can then decide on whether or not to appeal the ban and enroll the supporter in the KNVB forgiveness program. Supporters with bans exceeding the three year limit are exempt from the SAC. Events The AFCA Supportersclub have been responsible for several fundraisers for various causes, and organize various events, including indoor/outdoor sporting events, such as the famed Para Smit Tournament. AFCA are also largely responsible for organizing the commute to away matches for the various support groups such as F-side and VAK410, as well nationally as for continental away matches, such as for the UEFA Champions League for example. =Geef Ajax z'n gezicht terug!= Geef Ajax z'n gezicht terug! (English: Give Ajax his face back!) was a widespread campaign which was launched by the organization during the 2013-14 Eredivisie season, requesting to have the face of Ajax returned to the team crest by reverting to the logo which was in use prior to the current one. Posters appeared everywhere in Amsterdam with the catchphrase \\"Give Ajax his face back\\", with the campaign even finding its way into prominent Dutch media with significant news coverage, the group were able to collect a vast amount of signatures in support of the logo change. Ajax Supportershome The AFCA are responsible for the upkeep as well as various events which take place at the official Ajax Supportershome located right outside the Amsterdam Arena. The building is completely covered in graffiti pertaining to the history and imagery of the club, made by various CBS (Can't Be Stopped) members, a famed graffiti crew from Amsterdam associated with the AFCA Supportersclub At 3:30AM on Friday morning of 23 January 2015, the Ajax Supportershome was set on fire and burned to the ground, two days ahead of the Klassieker match against arch rivals Feyenoord. The building was completely destroyed, damage which included a large collection of art and memorabilia of the club, from the late honorary member Bobby Haarms and a large collection of shirts of past players were all destroyed in the fire. A few days later the fire department ruled the fire as a result of arson, with the police releasing a video showing two men entering the supporters home, and evading the burning building. It was the second time the building had been set on fire, when supporters of ADO Den Haag had previously set fire to it in 2005. In the aftermath of the fire, various former Ajax players such as Klaas-Jan Stuntelaar, John Heitinga, Hedwiges Maduro, Wesley Sneijder and Patrick Kluivert donated shirts and memorabilia for the new supporters home, while the RSCA Supportersclub of RSC Anderlecht in Belgium started a fund raiser to help the club, since the supporters of both clubs have kept close ties for many years.

The club was formed by the amalgamation of Royal Park Soccer Club and Albion Rovers Soccer Club in 1985. Since this time, the club has enjoyed success playing at the highest levels in Victorian football including finals campaigns in the Victorian Premier League (VPL), a host of Victorian State League titles and many League Cups. A combined five league titles between the Men and Women's team have given the club the most successful record of any Turkish backed club in Australian history. Currently the club's Senior Men team play in the Victorian State League Division 2 N/W competition. History Royal Park Soccer club was first formed in 1969 by the members of the Cyprus Turkish Association which consisted of first and second generation Turkish Cypriots. Some members of the association suggested that efforts towards other projects such as building a new mosque was more beneficial for the Turkish community before the establishment of a sporting club. However, after much deliberation the association decided that a sports and recreation club would not only provide an opportunity to engage the Turkish Cypriot community, but a better means of migrating its people into the Australian community ‚Äì hence the club was born. An initial sum of $500 was allocated towards the establishment costs of the Soccer club. The money allocated went towards purchasing essentials such as soccer balls, netting for the goals and other necessities. The first initial matches were organised friendly games against other nationality clubs. These games were played in Carlton at Princess Park on the famous Ground Number 6 and the majority of the players from Royal Park came from the Cyprus Turkish Association. The team was also known to have a few skillful players of Albanian background. Royal Park Soccer Club joined the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation entering at the lowest division in the season of 1969. A one dollar fee was charged to the players per game to cover their insurance and other playing costs. The team would travel as far as rural Mornington to officially compete against other clubs. The following year, Royal Park Soccer Club began to attract the interest of the new immigrants from Turkey. The club decided to register several experienced immigrant players who had played professionally in the Turkish football leagues in hope that the experience would bring much improved team performances. At the end of the season Royal Park achieved promotion much to the delight of the Turkish Cypriot community. The level of community support for the team could be measured by the increased number of spectator cars parked around the ground, beeping horns, flashing lights and cheering the team on match days. Several years later in 1986, Royal Park Soccer Club and the Cyprus Turkish Association decided to relocate to Sunshine after the sale of the club building. Royal Park merged with Scottish side Albion Rovers Soccer Club which was based at Selywn Park, Albion, and playing in the Victorian State League Division 1. The new club provided excellent facilities including a large clubroom, change room and generous grandstand, however the amalgamation was seen as a logical move as it allowed the club to grow amongst the local Turkish Cypriot community. After a season of power-sharing between the Turkish Cypriots and Scots, an AGM was called to determine the future of the soccer club. A members vote resulted in the election of a new Turkish president and the club would be known as Albion Rovers Turk Gucu Soccer Club. Over the next few seasons the club grew and Selwyn park often attracted large crowds in excess of 1000 people. By the late 1980s, the Scots interest in the administration of the club declined, despite a promotion to the Victorian Premier League (VPL) in 1989. The Scots opted to take a minority role in running the club but remained as loyal supporters. The Turkish Cypriot club members then decided to acknowledge its Scottish heritage by adopting a young Scottish man with a minor mental impairment as its club mascot. The young man known as \\"Johhny\\" would lead the team out on match days, sit with the team on the substitutes bench, as well as display his silky skills at half time much to the delight of the faithful.Albion Redsox Soccer Club Senior team circa 1995 In 1994, the Soccer club changed its name to the Albion Redsox which coincided with a renewed push from soccer authorities to force clubs to market themselves to mainstream Australia, as opposed to their own mostly migrant fan bases. The name change also coincided with the club celebrating its 25th anniversary in 1995, which allowed the members and supporters to reflect on its foundations and past successes. The celebrations were capped off with the club recording its most impressive season in history with a 5th-place finish in the VPL and a berth in the final series. In 1997, the Albion Redsox were forced into move away from Selwyn Park after a dispute with the Council in the sharing of the facilities at Selwyn Park. Limited opportunities in finding a new home meant the club would take an offer from the Melton Shire Council to base itself out of McPherson Park in Melton. The move, which was approximately 25 km away from its current base, would include a name change as the club would be known as the Melton Reds. The relocation seemed viable at the time but a significant decline in the club's supporter base and revenues would prove detrimental to the club. The Reds were relegated from the VPL after a disappointing year however the club would continue the suffering with back to back relegation in 1998. In 1999, the Albion Reds Soccer club decided to change its name to be known as the Satellite City Rovers in a bid to attract new interest to the club. The change lasted until the end following season where the club continued its struggle to survive. As a result, in 2001 the club ended its lease early with Melton Shire council and temporarily relocated back closer to its original home of Selwyn Park. The temporary move would see the club base themselves at the home of the Sunshine George Cross Soccer club in Sunshine, Victoria as the Rovers continued to struggle in finding a new base close to its original home of Selywn Park. The club eventually relocated to the Calabria club in Uniting Lane, Bulla where facilities including a car park, clubroom and reception center were available. It was probably another key decision to see the return of the Albion Rovers Soccer club name that attracted some of the club's loyal supporter base to return. The 2001 season ended in success as the club went on to be crowned champions of Victorian State League Division 2 North West. The successful season was topped off with Mustafa Mustafa winning the Victorian State League Division 2 Player of the Year, and it would be the same player who would back up the seasons performance by winning the Victorian State League Division 1 Player of the Year in season 2002. In 2003, the club would begin another turbulent period in its history. A change of ownership and lack of support resulted in the Rovers being relegated to below division, however the suffering would continue with back to back relegation in 2004. While the Soccer club was to stabilise in the following season, underlying problems remained with a lack of support and finances, so another move was decided by the club owners. The Rovers relocated to temporarily base themselves out of Green Gully Reserve in 2006, where the club's juniors were based, while negotiations took place on a potential new permanent home. The 2006 season would see the club miss out on promotion by a single point. It was in 2007, after much negotiation and assistance from the Brimbank City Council and in particular Mayor Natalie Suleyman, the Soccer club would be awarded brand new facilities at the home of Cairnlea Park in Cairnlea. The new home would feature two football grounds with extensive lighting, a large clubroom, 4 change rooms and large car park. The move included formally changing the club's name to Cairnlea FC. The move also reinvigorated the club and its members, and season 2007 saw the club achieve promotion after finishing second in the Victorian State League Division 3 North West. The success was short lived and the step up proved a difficult task for the club as a second bottom finish resulted in relegation from Victorian State League Division 2 North West in 2008. However, it was during this time Cairnlea FC decided to invest on its up-and-coming Senior Girls' football team. The girls begun to emerge as a powerhouse of female football in the western suburbs of Melbourne. In remarkable fashion, the Senior Girls' would go on a run of back to back promotion in years 2009, 2010 and 2011 under the guidance of former player and 2012 Brimbank Coach of the Year, Mustafa Fehmi. The success paved the way for the Girls' team to compete in the Victorian Women's Premier League ‚Äì the highest possible state league for woman. The club's girls' team were able to backed up their impressive performances by winning the annual Brimbank Cup in years 2012, 2013 and 2014. Cairnlea FC champions 2013 In 2013, the club added another promotion by finishing champions of Victorian State League Division 3 North West in remarkable fashion. The season included a 10-game unbeaten run that ended on the final day of the season where Cairnlea FC would travel away from home requiring one point to finish first. The season was capped off with multiple player awards including the leagues Golden boot winner Adem Alicevic with 18 goals and runner-up teammate Adamson Ajayi with 17. The club captain Mustafa Mustafa was awarded Victorian State League Division 3 Player of the Year Award. This was the first time in Cairnlea FC history, and only the second time since its amalgamation with the Albion Rovers Soccer Club that it had won a championship. The following year in 2014, Football Victoria introduced the National Premier Leagues Victoria competition, which resulted in a restructure for the state leagues. As a result of achieving promotion, the club was moved up into State League 1, now the third tier of football in the state, finishing in fourth. A change in committee and direction in 2015 saw the club once again relegated to State League 2 in where it currently resides. In 2018, after the resignations of the existing committee, a new executive board and committee was assembled in an attempt to stabilise the club. As part of the new committees 5-year strategy (2018‚Äì2022), the club changed its name back to Albion Rovers FC and updated its logo. This coincided with the club's 50th anniversary and was seen as an important step to reconnect with the club's identity.

It is one of several produced by the hydrolysis of allicin, including diallyl disulfide and diallyl tetrasulfide, DATS is one of the most potent. Biological applications s the vasoactivity of garlic DATS has been shown to selectively kill cancerous cells in the prostate and breast, leaving healthy cells unharmed. This effect is attributed to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cancer cells, increased the number of cells that arrest in the G2 phase of mitosis, and promote an increase in caspase-3 activity. These effects appear to contribute to the apoptosis of cancer cells and a decrease in cancer cell proliferation. DATS can be metabolized by glutathione in red blood cells to form hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This conversion occurs at a consistent rate over a prolonged period of time, rendering DATS a good source of H2S. H2S is a cardioprotective agent that has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects,. A major topic of research is the impact of hydrogen sulfide on reducing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Reperfusion injury is a significant threat to myocardial function that arises with the reintroduction of blood flow to the heart following an ischemic episode. Reperfusion triggers an inflammatory response and often results in oxidative damage. H2S decreases injury through many different effects such a decrease in oxidative stress, maintenance of mitochondrial function, and increased eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) activation. eNOS is activated via phosphorylation by H2S through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which increases the formation and bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). This negatively impacts mitochondria functionality. The mitochondria has been known to protect the heart from ischemic-reperfusion injury through the opening of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel,. This causes vasodilation and improves hemodynamics. DATS is a promising treatment for cardiac arrhythmias through its ability to change the opening of the human ether-√†-go-go-related (hERG) channel. hERG is the pore- forming subunit of potassium channels that create delayed rectifier potassium ion currents in many cells, including cardiac myocytes. The delayed rectifier potassium ion current is largely responsible for the repolarization of ventricular cardiac myocytes by permitting potassium efflux. DATS causes a decrease in the steady-state inactivation, alters deactivation, and impairs trafficking of the hERG channel from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane of the cell. This decreases the amount of functional potassium ion rectifier channels on the cell membrane and thus, slows depolarization. However, hERG trafficking impairment has also been shown to cause arrhythmias due to the development of long QT syndrome and should be considered in drug development.

In the beginning of 18th century BC, Hassum allied with Yamhad against Yahdun-Lim of Mari, it later helped Yamhad against a kingdom in Zalmakum (a marshy region between the Euphrates and lower Balikh), but then shifted alliance to Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria after he annexed Mari and sent him a 1000 troops to attack Sumu-Epuh of Yamhad. later, Yarim-Lim I of Yamhad brought Hassum under his hegemony, the city remained subjugated to Yamhad until the Hittite conquest. =Hittite Conquest= In the course of his war against Yamhad, Hattusili I of the Hittites, having destroyed Alalakh and Urshu, headed toward Hassum in his sixth year (around 1644 BC, middle chronology), Yarim-Lim III of Yamhad sent his army under the leadership of General Zukrassi the heavy-armed troops leader accompanied by General Zaludis the commander of the Manda troops, they united with the army of Hashshum, then the battle of Atalur mountain ensued (Atalur is located north of Aleppo not very far from the Amanus, it can be identified with the Kurd-Dagh Mountains), Hattusili destroyed his enemies and moved on to burn and loot Hassum.

The game was played at Investors Group Field in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Shaw Communications was the presenting sponsor of the game; it was the first time in CFL history that the Grey Cup has been sponsored. The Eskimos won the contest 26‚Äì20 to claim their 14th Grey Cup championship in franchise history and first since 2005. Mike Reilly was named Most Valuable Player and Shamawd Chambers received the Dick Suderman Trophy as Most Valuable Canadian. It was the Eskimos' first Grey Cup win that did not involve Hugh Campbell in any capacity with the organization since the 1975 Grey Cup.  Background  =Host city= On March 24, 2014, news agencies reported that the game would be awarded to Winnipeg. Two days later on March 26, it was announced at a news conference that Investors Group Field in Winnipeg, Manitoba, will play host to the 103rd Grey Cup. It was the fourth time Winnipeg played host to a Grey Cup, the first time since 2006, and the first at the new Investors Group Field, which opened in 2013. Although the game was sold out, the attendance figure of 36,634 was the second lowest for a Grey Cup game since 1975. = Teams = Ottawa Redblacks The Redblacks joined the CFL as an expansion team in 2014 and finished last in the league with a 2‚Äì16 record. Led by 40-year-old Henry Burris, who became the oldest quarterback in CFL history to lead the league in passing yards (5,693), the Redblacks won the East Division title in 2015 with a 12‚Äì6 record. It marked the first time since the 1978 Ottawa Rough Riders that any team from Ottawa won a division title, while 12 wins in the season is the highest total of any Ottawa-based Canadian football team in league history. The Redblacks hosted the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the East Division Final, for Ottawa's third consecutive match-up with the Ticats following two wins to end the regular season; in between, Hamilton had defeated the Toronto Argonauts, 25‚Äì22 in the East semi-final. The final was a closely contested game: Hamilton tied the game at 28‚Äì28 with 94 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter when quarterback Jeremiah Masoli, making only his second career playoff start, found Luke Tasker for a touchdown. On defence, Hamilton then had Ottawa pinned deep in their own territory on second down and 25 yards and hoped to recover the ball in the final minute to try for a game-winning field goal. Instead, Burris completed a 93-yard pass and run play to wide receiver Greg Ellingson who scored the game-winning touchdown; The 35‚Äì28 final made the Redblacks the first Ottawa team to reach the championship game since the Rough Riders lost to Edmonton at the 69th Grey Cup in 1981. Edmonton Eskimos The Edmonton Eskimos finished their season with a record of 14-4 (their best performance since 1989 in which they went 16-2). The Calgary Stampeders, the defending Grey Cup champions, finished with the same record as the Eskimos after the regular season. However, Edmonton clinched first place in the division (and a playoff bye) by virtue of defeating Calgary in two of three regular season contests. The two teams met again in the Western Final after Calgary defeated the BC Lions 35‚Äì9 in the Western Semi-Final. The Eskimos earned the right to represent the West in the Grey Cup game by virtue of a 45‚Äì31 victory against the Stampeders at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. The 2015 Western Final game was the first time in CFL history where both teams came in with a 14-4 record in the regular season. Quarterback Mike Reilly was the offensive catalyst for the Eskimos as he passed for three touchdowns and ran for two more in the win. Edmonton reached its first championship game since winning the 93rd Grey Cup ten years earlier, making the 103rd Grey Cup the first of the modern era to be played by two teams that have not been any of the preceding nine championship games.  Entertainment  Country performer Dean Brody performed as part of pre-game festivities, while Quebecois singer Bobby Bazini performed the national anthem. American rock band Fall Out Boy performed during halftime. Game summary The Redblacks got out to a quick start as quarterback Henry Burris threw a pair of touchdowns in the first six minutes and nine seconds of the game: Ottawa completed a six play opening drive for their first score, then recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff that led to a second, but unconverted, touchdown as the Redblacks took a 13‚Äì0 lead before Edmonton's offence had a chance to take the field. Edmonton answered with a field goal followed by a Mike Reilly touchdown pass to Adarius Bowman late in the first quarter. An Ottawa field goal and a single point for Edmonton following a missed field goal attempt moved Edmonton within five points, trailing 16‚Äì11 with a little under five minutes to play in the first half. A two-yard touchdown pass by Reilly to Akeem Shavers gave the Eskimos a 17‚Äì16 lead at half time. The second half became what the Edmonton Journal called a \\"brutal defensive struggle\\". The Redblacks regained the lead as they turned a 42-yard pass interference penalty to Edmonton into a field goal, while Edmonton scored one point off a punt, and then missed a field goal late in the quarter as Sean Whyte's attempt hit the uprights and out; Ottawa led the game through three quarters by a 19‚Äì18 score. They added a point in the fourth quarter when kicker Chris Milo, attempting to pin Edmonton's offence deep in their own zone, instead kicked a wind-aided 72-yard punt into the end zone. The score then remained unchanged until the final minutes of the contest as Edmonton marched the ball 78 yards, aided significantly by consecutive pass interference penalties to Ottawa, the second called after a coaches' challenge that the referees initially failed to penalize. Jordan Lynch then scored on a one-yard touchdown run that gave Edmonton a 26‚Äì20 lead with 3:22 left to play, and which held up as the final score of the game. For the Eskimos, it was the 14th Grey Cup championship in franchise history, and their first since 2005. Mike Reilly was named Most Valuable Player after completing 21 of 35 pass attempts for 269 yards with two touchdown passes. He was also Edmonton's leading rusher at 66 yards. Shamawd Chambers, who missed the majority of the 2015 season with a knee injury, received the Dick Suderman Trophy as Most Valuable Canadian.

She is known for being the founder of the Christian Bible Home for women and its combined mission work and social work among the poor in Stockholm.Elisabeth (Elsa) Dionysia Borg, www.skbl.se/sv/artikel/ElsaBorg, Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon (artikel av Pia Lundqvist), h√§mtad 2020-07-15. Early years and education Elisabeth \\"Elsa\\" Dionysia Borg was born in Rytterne, V√§stmanland, 19 July 1826. She was the daughter of the vicar Denis Borg (d. 1837) and Hedvig Elisabet Borg (d. 1830). Her mother was the cousin of P√§r Aron Borg. Borg was educated in a girls' school in first Sala and then Stockholm, and finally at the school of Cecilia Fryxell. Educator After having completed her education, she worked as a governess. Between 1859 and 1874, Elsa Borg functioned as the principal of the Christian Girls' School in G√§vle, regarded as the local pioneer secondary education institution for females in that city. She ended her educational career in 1874 because she had become overworked, and retired to the home of her former colleague, the former teacher Alfhild Flodin, who married the businessman H. A. Lidholm and settled on the estae N√•dhammar in S√∂rmland. Social worker and missionary Elsa Borg was one of the foremost representatives of the Great Awakening in Sweden. On N√•dhammar, she became acquainted with a group of Christian philanthropists who considered her to be a suitable person to open a Christian Bible Home for women in the slum of the capital. The project was to employ Bible women to act as missionaries in the slum, pass out bibles and preach in combination witch social work. The idea was inspired by the London Bible and Domestic Female Mission, started in London by Ellen Ranyard in 1857. Elsa Borg accepted the offer to organize the project in Sweden, after making a study visit to the English role model in London.Elisabeth (Elsa) Dionysia Borg, www.skbl.se/sv/artikel/ElsaBorg, Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon (artikel av Pia Lundqvist), h√§mtad 2020-07-15. In 1875, Elsa Borg moved to Stockholm, where she founded a Bible Home for women with the support of Queen Sophia. After a visit to Great Britain in 1876 and 1878, she came to know William Boardman and Granville Waldegrave, 3rd Baron Radstock, and having returned to Sweden, she devoted herself to mission work combined with Christian social work. The institution was situated in the Stockholm ill-reputed slum of Vita Bergen ('White Mountains'). The home was meant to educate female Christian social workers. In 1877, it expanded to include an asylum for former female prostitutes, in 1881 an orphanage and in 1883 a hospital, and in 1885 a home for the education of missionaries: this was followed by branches in other parts of the country. From 1885, she also published a missionary paper, Trons hvila. She died 24 February 1909, in Vita Bergen ('White Mountains'), Stockholm.

Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant; April 27, 1822 ‚Äì July 23, 1885) was the 18th president of the United States (1869‚Äì1877) following his success as military commander in the American Civil War. Under Grant, the Union Army defeated the Confederate military, secession and the war, which ended with the surrender of Robert E. Lee's army at Appomattox Court House. As president, Grant led the Radical Republicans in their effort to eliminate vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African American citizenship, and pursued Reconstruction in the former Confederate states. In foreign policy, Grant sought to increase American trade and influence, while remaining at peace with the world. Although his Republican Party split in 1872 as reformers denounced him, Grant was easily reelected. During his second term the country's economy was devastated by the Panic of 1873, while investigations exposed corruption scandals in the administration. While still below average, his reputation among scholars has significantly improved in recent years because of greater appreciation for his commitment to civil rights, moral courage in his prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan, and enforcement of voting rights. There are abundant historical material resources on Grant and his role during the Civil War and thereafter. However, there have been few historical scholarly studies, mostly negative, on his presidency. Analysis of Grant's presidency by some modern scholars, including Grant biographers Jean Edward Smith (2001) and H.W. Brands (2012), have generally been more positive and less critical of Grant. Encyclopedic presidential summary biographies of Grant rely heavily on secondary sources and tend to offer non scholarly negative views of Grant. According to one bibliographical source, to obtain a more complete assessment of Grant and his presidency during Reconstruction both contemporary, primary, and scholarly accounts of Grant, his Inaugural Addresses, including his communications and annual messages to Congress are recommended readings.

He is former Member of Parliament from the Karakat constituency in Rohtas district, Bihar. He is a former member of the Rajya Sabha. He is leader of his own party the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party. Early life Upendra Singh was born to Muneshwar Singh and Muneshwari Devi on 6 February 1960 in Vaishali, Bihar into a middle class family. He graduated from Science College, Patna and then did MA in Political Science from BR Ambedkar Bihar University, Muzaffarpur. Kushwaha also worked as a lecturer in the politics department of Samata College. Later he added Kushwaha to his name. Politics Upendra Kushwaha stepped into the world of politics in 1985. From 1985 to 1988, he was the state general secretary of Yuva Lok Dal. Latter he became National General-Secretary, Yuva Janata Dal, 1988-93. He had also worked as General- Secretary for Samata Party, 1994-2002. Kushwaha was Member of Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2000-2005 and appointed as Deputy Leader (Samata Party) Bihar Legislative Assembly. In March 2004 after loksabha election Sushil Modi was elected to Loksabha and the same time number of MLA's of JD(U) increased than BJP. Since leader of JD(U) changed his party. So kushwaha became leader of opposition.Oneindia.com Upendra Kushwaha addressing a gathering, on the occasion of the CBSE Teachers' award 2015, in New Delhi on September 03, 2016. Kushwaha started his electoral politics in 2000 winning from Jandaha. He was dismissed from the Janata Dal (United) in 2007. Kushwaha founded the Rashtriya Samata Party in February 2009. The party was formed in the backdrop of alleged marginalisation of the Koeri caste and autocratic rule by the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar. The formation of the party was supported by Chhagan Bhujbal, the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra. In November 2009, the party was merged into the Janata Dal (United) with the mending of ties between Kushwaha and Kumar. On 4 January 2013, Upendra Kushwaha who at the time was a Rajya Sabha member resigned from the Janata Dal (United). He alleged that the Nitish model had failed and that the law and order situation was becoming as bad as it had been 7 years ago. He further alleged that the Nitish Kumar runs his government through autocratic means and that he had turned the Janata Dal (United) into his \\"pocket organisation\\". Kushwaha founded the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party on 3 March 2013 and unveiled the name and flag of his party at a rally at the historic Gandhi Maidan. He contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Narendra Modi. He was elected from the Karakat constituency and was appointed as Minister of State in Human Resource Development ministry. In December 2018, he resigned from the ministry and left the NDA, accusing Modi of not fulfilling his poll promises regarding Bihar. Shri Pranab Mukherjee administering the oath as Minister of State to Shri Upendra Kushwaha, at a Swearing-in Ceremony, at Rashtrapati Bhavan, in New Delhi Initially, Kushwaha gave a number of indications to NDA leadership regarding his discontent due to diminishing importance as an ally. Kushwaha's party RLSP finally broke out from NDA alliance as it was not given appropriate seats in Lok Sabha elections of 2019. The NDA leadership was skeptical of Kushwaha's influence on member of Koeri caste and believed that even without his support they could win the elections in Bihar. It is believed that Nitish Kumar too holds considerable hold on both koeri and kurmi community, as a counter to which BJP had earlier selected Keshav Prasad Maurya as its Uttar Pradesh chief. Hence, they were ready to face exodus of Kushwaha. Meanwhile they were sure of reaping the popularity of Nitish, who was now an ally of BJP and had gained considerable reputation in Bihar due to his development model. Kushwaha hence joined United Progressive Alliance front, which contained Rashtriya Janata Dal, Hindustani Awam Morcha, as well as Vikassheel Insaan Party.He contested 2019 Lok Sabha election from two seats namely Karakat as well as Ujiyarpur. Kushwaha lost from both the seats. The grand alliance of above mentioned parties under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav was not able to win even a single seat in Bihar in 2019 Lok Sabha election.

In the course of 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, Upendra Kushwaha's speech sparked controversy when he referred to the newly formed alliance of his party and Rashtriya Janata Dal as 'Kheer'. According to political analysts, RLSP represents Kushwahas who are also called Koeris in Bihar while RJD represents Yadavs. The traditional occupation of these castes being growing paddy as well as cattle domestication. Hence, reference to Kheer was said to be the implicit indication to alliance of two influential backward castes. After losing in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Kushwaha once again made a controversial statement. He warned NDA leadership that if the result of elections is deteriorated, the blood will flow on streets. However, later on a notice from Election Commission, he clarified that his intention was not of provoking violence. In September 2020, prior to the election to Bihar Legislative Assembly, Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP eschewed the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress led coalition which was formed during the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 to counter National Democratic Alliance in Bihar. Kushwaha announced the formation of third front in partnership with Bahujan Samaj Party. This front contested on all 243 seats of Bihar Assembly against three other political fronts namely NDA, which included JD (U) and BJP; UPA, which included RJD, Congress and Vikassheel Insaan Party and one another alliance which contained various small parties led by Jan Adhikar Party. Kushwaha sought the unacceptability of the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav as the reason behind his seperation from the 'Grand Alliance'.

Its primary purpose was to bring quarried slate down to the main line for onward transport. It opened in July 1884, and a local passenger service was run as well as trains for the mineral traffic. Intense road competition led to the cessation of ordinary passenger services in 1951; goods traffic and occasional passenger excursion journeys kept the line going until its complete closure in July 1962. Conception The Bethesda branch line in 1887The Chester and Holyhead Railway opened its main line in 1850. Its main objective was to convey the Irish mail traffic, and at the time intermediate traffic was expected to be insignificant. Quarrying was a significant industry in Bethesda: the local quarries were known as Penrhyn Quarry, and they were served by a narrow gauge line, the Penrhyn Railway, opened in 1801. The slate was conveyed to Port Penrhyn, immediately east of Bangor for onward transport to marlet. The Penrhyn line had inclined planes. In 1852 a standard gauge line was built in partial substitution for the narrow gauge line.Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, 1991, Nairn, , pages 110 to 112Bill Rear, From Chester to Holyhead: the Branch Lines, Oxford Publishing Company, Hersham, 2003, , pages 129 to 135 Bethesda was situated on Thomas Telford‚Äôs road to Holyhead, so road communication was already unusually good for the early period.Rex Christiansen, Forgotten Railways: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, 1984, , pages 97 and 98 A line was proposed in 1866 for a line between Bangor and Llanberis through Bethesda, but it failed in Parliament. A similar scheme for a narrow gauge line was put forward in 1871 but it too failed. Nevertheless there was local demand for a standard gauge railway connection, and a branch line from a junction with the Chester and Holyhead line near Bangor was authorised by Parliament on 6 August 1880. By now the Chester and Holyhead Railway had been absorbed into the London and North Western Railway. Opening The line was duly built by the LNWR and opened for passenger traffic on 1 July 1884, and for goods trains on 1 September 1885. 1895 passenger service Bradshaw‚Äôs Guide for 1895 shows the passenger trains service: there were four trains each way weekdays, with an additional later train each way on Saturdays.Bradshaw's Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland: December 1895, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2018, The passenger train service was six trains each way daily, but railmotors were introduced in 1908 and the service was increased to 16 daily, 9 on Sunday by the 1930s. After 1923 In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were grouped in to one or other of four new, large concerns, under the Railways Act 1921. The LNWR was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway. In 1948 a further restructuring took place, when nationalisation took place, following the Transport Act 1947. British Railways was now the owner of the branch line. After World War II the passenger use of the line had reduced considerably; more convenient buses to Bangor used the Telford road, and passenger trains were withdrawn on 3 December 1951. Occasional excursions ran after that date, as the area had a certain beauty, but the line closed completely on 7 October 1963. Topography The line climbed all the way from the main line, rising for much of the way at 1 in 40. Tregarth Tunnel was on the line, just below Bethesda.

In response, the BBC brought forward Working Girls, which had originally been scheduled as the second episode on 6 March. Subsequent episodes were screened as shown below, and were presumably in the intended order, except that Big Wednesday was eventually shown fifth, after McClellan had emerged from the coma. Big Wednesday being shown so late introduces a continuity error, in that it is during the episode that Mandy accidentally uses Matthew's surfboard as an ironing board, leaving it with the prominent burn visible \\"earlier\\" in Matthew, A Suitable Case for Treatment. However, the damage is not visible when the surfboard is seen in The Great Escape and Bad Timing, suggesting that those episodes should actually appear before both Big Wednesday and Matthew... The order in which the episodes were broadcast initially and in the 1996 repeat season also introduce a continuity error regarding Mandy's debt. In The Great Escape, Matthew states that Mandy owes rent of \\"2 thousand quid\\". In Matthew..., Matthew lets Mandy off \\"between 2 and 3 thousand quid rent\\", which implies the debt has been mounting up since The Great Escape. When first repeated in early 1996, the episodes were shown in the following order: :Big Wednesday (4 January 1996) :Matthew - A Suitable Case for Treatment (11 January 1996) :The Great Escape (18 January 1996) :Bad Timing (25 January 1996) :Working Girls (1 February 1996) :Fame (8 February 1996) On the VHS and DVD releases, the following order was used: :Big Wednesday :Working Girls :The Great Escape :Bad Timing :Matthew - A Suitable Case for Treatment :Fame Series 2 (1996) { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" width=\\"98%\\" style=\\"background:#FFFFFF;\\" ! style=\\"background:#FFCCCC;\\" # ! style=\\"background:#FFCCCC;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#FFCCCC;\\" Original airdate } Despite the official titles appearing onscreen at the start of each episode, advance artwork for the VHS releases showed alternative titles on the cover. Notably, the provisional artwork also showed the actual video release names the wrong way round, with the last three episodes titled \\"Second Match - Round 1\\" and the first three as \\"Second Match - Round 2\\". The episode titles on (Round 1) were: Hostages, Matthew's Secret Journal, and Nightwatch, whereas (Round 2) featured the episodes: Martin's First Date, Agoraphobics, Homosexuals & Virgins, and The Big Day Out. After series one, Ben Chaplin was cast in the film The Truth About Cats & Dogs and further Hollywood films. For series two, his part was given to Neil Stuke who had been the second choice for the part of Matthew at the first series auditions.https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/gameon/ At the end of the first episode of series two, the substitution of Stuke for Chaplin is acknowledged in a post-credits scene. The trio are watching Roseanne which had previously referenced the change in actresses playing Becky by having the cast watch TV and comment on actors changing and no one noticing, then looking at Becky. In Game On, Martin asks \\"I wonder who's playing the daughter this week?!\\" to which Mandy remarks: \\"Don't you just hate that, when they keep the same character and change the actor?\\" Both Mandy and Martin then look subtly yet strangely accusingly at Matt, sitting between them on the sofa, who looks worried.

(2006) British film posters: An illustrated history. London: British Film Institute, pp. 185-190. was an Italian commercial artist who specialised in cinema posters and book covers. His heyday was in 1960s London. Career in Italy Renato Fratini studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. He began his career in the early 1950s by joining the studio owned by the Guerri brothers. There he mostly worked on illustrations and comic strips. In 1952 he joined the Augusto Favalli's studio, which was at that time Italy‚Äôs biggest producer of film posters. He worked with artists such as Nicola Simbari, Enrico DeSeta and Giorgio De Gaspari.\\"Taking the rough with the smooth\\" by David Roach in Illustrators, No. 2, 2012, pp. 82-89. During his six-year stay in the studio, Fratini made many memorable illustrations for films such as Senso, Invaders from Mars, The Sweet Smell of Success, and La Donna Piu Bella Del Mondo, the last being notable for his portrait of Gina Lollobrigida. Fratini also experimented with abstract elements. Following the collapse of the Favalli studio in the late 1950s he moved to Milan and joined the D'ami studio. Through agents he got commissions to paint covers for Sexton Blake, Famous Romance Library and Thriller, all from Fleetway Publications. London He moved to London in late 1958, despite not speaking English, and there he enjoyed a very productive career throughout the 1960s. =Cinema posters= It was Eric Pulford, who ran the Downton agency, that brought Fratini to London. Downton held the Rank account and accounts with most of the other large studios. Rank was connected to the Cinecitta studios in Rome and Fratini was working at the Cinecitti publicity studio, Studio Favalli.An interview with Sim Branaghan, author of British Film Posters: An Illustrated History Film on Paper, 10 February 2012. Retrieved 30 March 2014. Archived here. In cinema posters, Fratini produced the artwork for From Russia With Love (1963) from a design by Eddie Paul. Other work included Whistle Down The Wind (1961), Phantom of the Opera (1962), This Sporting Life (1963), The Chalk Garden (1964), Hot Enough for June (1964), Maroc 7 (1966), Khartoum (1966). Often Eric Pulford produced the design and Fratini did the painting. Fratini also illustrated most of the posters for the Carry On films of the period from designs by Pulford, starting with Don't Lose Your Head (1966) up to Carry on at Your Convenience (1971). By then he was making ¬£1000 per poster. As a poster painter, the high point was in 1970 when Fratini was paid ¬£2000 for his work on Waterloo from a design by Eric Pulford. Vic Fair commented on the apparently detailed design \\"All that detail ... Fratini could just knock it in. Look closely, and there's actually nothing there! Genius, really.\\" =Book covers= In London he completed work for publishers Corgi, Coronet, Hodder and Pan amongst others. He often used the palette knife and the unpolished nature of his work was both atmospheric and popular with art directors who could use it without needing to spend more on finishing. He was commissioned by Penguin art director Germano Facetti to prepare new covers for the paperback editions of Daphne du Maurier's novels. The well-received covers combined paint and pencil to create distinctive tableaux of juxtaposed images with a rough unfinished tone. Covers for historical romance novels by Catherine Gaskin, Victoria Holt, Norah Lofts and others were a staple of his output and he produced many for Fontana, for whom he was a favourite artist. His work was still being used years after his death until styles gradually changed. =Magazine illustration= Fratini was an active magazine illustrator. His first U.K. magazine commission was a double page spread for Woman's Mirror, 1963. He also worked for Homes and Garden, Woman's Journal and Woman. In 1965 he was asked to illustrate a Modesty Blaise serial for King magazine over four issues. Personal life In 1959 Fratini met the fashion designer Georgina Somerset-Butler at a party and they married in 1961, after which she went by the name Gina Fratini. They later divorced. Fratini was known for his exuberant love of life. Gina said \\"He loved food, loved drink, loved cigars, loved dancing ... he just liked to generally live it up. He adored jazz, and we were always out at Ronnie Scott's.\\" Fratini had a great confidence in his own abilities, which was justified by his skill. Ken Paul described him as \\"the only man I ever saw who could actually draw with a paintbrush\\". He left for Mexico in around 1970 but continued to do some work for the U.K. He also did work for the American market at this time including advertising for Pepsi Cola. He was at a beach party in Mexico in 1973 when he died suddenly, reportedly of a heart attack.

Description The IBA comprises some 227 km2 of forests and wetlands in Tilomar Subdistrict, Cova Lima District, some 100 km south- west of the national capital, Dili, near the southern Timor Sea coast of the island not far from the border with Indonesia. It ranges in elevation from sea level up to about 1000 m. The principal natural habitat is tropical deciduous forest on limestone hills, with perennial springs at the foot of the hills supporting patches of tropical evergreen forest. Although most of the coastal forests have been cleared for agriculture, the IBA includes a small freshwater lagoon as well as saline coastal lagoons. Birds The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of bar-necked cuckoo-doves, black cuckoo-doves, Wetar ground doves, pink-headed imperial pigeons, yellow-crested cockatoos, jonquil parrots, cinnamon-banded kingfishers, streak-breasted honeyeaters, Timor friarbirds, black-breasted myzomelas, plain gerygones, fawn-breasted whistlers, green figbirds, olive-brown orioles, Timor stubtails, buff-banded thicketbirds, Timor leaf warblers, spot-breasted heleias, orange-sided thrushes, white-bellied bush chats, black-banded flycatchers, Timor blue flycatchers, blue-cheeked flowerpeckers, flame-breasted sunbirds, tricoloured parrotfinches and Timor sparrows.

It was published by Palgrave Macmillan, and was on released November 8, 2011. The book is both a description for how global interconnectivity through migration and trade is making the world more prosperous and peaceful, and a passionate argument for more open borders around the world to help talent circulate globally. Reception =Book reviews= Katherine Mangu-Ward, then managing editor of Reason Magazine, reviewed the book favorably for The Wall Street Journal, concluding her review as follows: \\"It is galling to Mr. Guest that many well-meaning people are more invested in promoting ideas like Third World microcredit than in clamoring for easier immigration. Lant Pritchett, the former World Bank economist, shares Mr. Guest's skepticism about the importance of the much ballyhooed microloans that help the world's poorest people to buy livestock or open a small business. The concept was pioneered by Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Pritchett tells the author that the average gain for a Bangladeshi from a lifetime of these loans is about the same as the earnings from working just eight weeks in America. \\"If I get 3,000 Bangladeshi workers into the U.S.,\\" Mr. Pritchett wonders, \\"do I get the Nobel Peace Prize?\\" No, but with luck Mr. Guest's argument in \\"Borderless Economics\\" will be rewarded with serious attention in the places that count.\\" Richard N. Cooper reviewed the book briefly for Foreign Affairs, concluding: \\"In Guest‚Äôs judgment, this receptiveness will assure that the United States remains number one in the world economy ‚Äì unless thoughtlessly more restrictive immigration policies take hold.\\" =Interviews= An After Words interview by Cecilia Kang of The Washington Post of Guest about his book was taped on November 15, 2011, and aired on December 17, 2011.

He spent most of his adult life working in the printing trade as a profession, but spent most of his spare time designing and building hybrid folk instruments and performing at live music events with his wife Doris (Mindrup) Mayfield and youngest son, Layne Mayfield. Lyle is notable for his invention of both the guitalin and guinjo, hybrid folk instruments combining features of several traditional folk instruments. Early Life and Family The Mayfield family music story began in the mid-1930s when Lyle‚Äôs mother purchased him a 25-cent harmonica. She turned to the seven-year-old and said, \\"Learn to play it, son. I like French harp music.\\" Next came the acquisition of a six-dollar, used guitar. The friend he bought it from showed Lyle three chords. Eight months later the friend‚Äôs band had a new guitar player. In 1950, Lyle Mayfield married Doris Mindrup, and less than a year later the couple were doing their own radio show on WSMI in Litchfield, Illinois, as the \\"Bond County Sweethearts.\\" The title changed to \\"The Mayfield Family\\" as their children (oldest to youngest) David, Lynda and Layne came on the scene. David made his debut on the show at the age of three months. He lay in an empty guitar case in the studio while Mom and Pop crooned. One day he decided to add a little harmony of his own. Lyle apologized to the listeners for the unexpected voice in the background. A listener wrote in saying, \\"Don‚Äôt apologize. It‚Äôs the best music on your show.\\" Musical Performance Career Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the Mayfields appeared to perform at hundreds of festivals, picnics, shows, church activities, benefits, square dances and ordinary jam sessions. Some of the highlights include bookings at the Olde Towne School of Folk Music in Chicago (where they were once an act in the same concert as bluegrass artist Bill Monroe),Billboard Magazine, December 28th, 1968, pp. 31-32 The First Annual Arkansas Folk Festival, The Lincoln Jamboree in Kentucky, Illinois State Fair, The 1976 Bi-Centennial Smithsonian Folklife Festival held in Washington, DC and various other functions from Kansas City to Grand Rapids to St. Louis to Indianapolis to Battle Ground, Indiana. Starting with their first 45rpm single in 1964, the Mayfields recorded two singles, one LP and more than 40 self-produced cassette albums. They have also contributed to several other albums for various folk music groups around the country. In 1964, they cut five bands on an album of folk music produced by the Campus Folksong Club at the University of Illinois. It was entitled \\"Green Fields of Illinois.\\" From this Lyle came up with the inspiration for the song \\"Green Fields of Illinois\\", which a local state senator briefly worked and failed to get accepted as the state song of Illinois. It became the duo's theme song and is the title song of their LP album \\"Green Fields Re-Visited.\\" From a repertoire of songs and influences numbering in the thousands, the Mayfields brought a family-oriented program ranging from folksongs to popular tunes of the 1930s and 1940s to classic country to down home gospel. They supplemented this with many of their own original compositions. They owned and played a variety of instruments, several of which Lyle designed and built himself. Among these inventions were the guitalin and guinjo. Upon Lyle's death, there were more than 100 instruments counted in the Mayfield home. Lyle worked as a journeyman printer for many newspapers in Southern Illinois, including The Greenville Advocate for many years. He was a columnist for the Advocate with his column entitled \\"Thoughts In Passing\\", which ran in the paper for several years. In 1949 he helped establish the Explorer Scouts in Greenville, Illinois, and in 1950 was a founding member of Boy Scout Troop 50 in Greenville. In the 1960s, Lyle and Doris Mayfield were involved in the name = University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign Campus Folksong Club and were associated with Archie Green during that time.Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, September 20, 1963, p. 9 In the mid-1960s, Lyle was credited for bringing the native music of Illinois to the Campus Folksong Club and appeared on recordings that the club produced, including the \\"Green Fields of Illinois\\" record.Introduction to the Campus Folksong Club, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, November 19, 1965, p. 4Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Saturday, February 22, 1964, p. 7 Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Wednesday, February 19, 1964, p. 4 He and Doris regularly appeared in performances held by the Folksong Club, commonly referred to as \\"folk sings\\".Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, November 09, 1962, p. 11 .Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Saturday, February 22, 1964, p. 1 Daily Illini (University of Illinois), Friday, October 4, 1963, p. 3 They also volunteered their time and talents to perform for other events and venues.The Greenville Advocate, Thursday, August 31, 1972 In 1976, Lyle and Doris Mayfield, along with their son Layne, were invited by the Smithsonian Institution to represent Southern Illinois at the American Bicentennial Smithsonian Folklife Festival.The Greenville Advocate, August 21, 1980, p. 15 It was at this event that they had a good opportunity to showcase some of their unique folk instruments; namely the guitalin and guinjo. Throughout most of the 1970s, the Mayfields devoted much time to preserving traditional southern Illinois music and folklore. Additionally, they were the founders and principle sponsors of the annual Southern Illinois Folk Convention in the early 1970s.The Greenville Advocate, Thursday, March 23, 1972 Later life and death Lyle stated over a phone interview with the host of \\"Living in Illinois\\" (a radio show based in Springfield, Illinois) that \\"in the mid-1920s, three 50,000-watt radio stations created a triangular area and bombarded it with live music, introducing musical sounds from around the United States and the world. Those who lived in that golden triangle of sound absorbed it all. I can't say with any degree of certainty how this affected aspiring musicians in other areas, but in my neck of the woods musicians digested it all, and what we absorbed filtered into our own musical creativity.\\" Through his ongoing musical career, Lyle cited Eddy Arnold as one of the strongest influences in the urban audiences of acceptance of \\"hillbilly music\\", renaming it, more politely, \\"Traditional Country\\". As recordings obtained more quality and availability, the era from the 1930s to the 1960s covered the region of Southern Illinois with a thick blanket of melodies and lyrics. While the Mayfields tried not to restrict themselves from listening to any one brand of music, they took issue with mutations of their dearly-held musical terminology. Lyle scoffed at Bob Dylan being held as a folk songwriter, saying, \\"you don't write a popular folk song. That music evolved; it tells a story.\\" Lyle said that some of Dylan's music may become folk if it lasts a few generations. He disliked new country, saying there was \\"no such thing\\". He also didn't like hard rock and was adamant that rap had \\"nothing to do with music\\". Bluegrass to Lyle was a \\"Johnny-come-lately\\" to his part of the country and he seemed to only enjoy it in its pure form. Throughout their region, Lyle and Doris Mayfield were known for helping to keep the history of music alive by \\"vivid recall and recitation\\".

The film stars Marko Zaror and Noah Segan. Zaror plays a former hit man who seeks redemption through killing the drug gangs he once served. It premiered in September 2014 at Fantastic Fest.  Plot  Former hit man Nicky Pardo regularly plays Russian roulette with a stylized pistol. Flashbacks reveal that, during a confrontation, he accidentally killed the son of a rival hit man known as the Scorpion. In revenge, the Scorpion tortures both Pardo and his pregnant wife, forces Pardo to kill his wife to end her suffering, and leaves Pardo for dead in a desert. The Scorpion leaves behind his stylized pistol as a way to escape dehydration. Pardo pulls the trigger three times but survives. In the present, he targets the former drug gangs that he once served, giving them an ultimatum to either repent or die. As a result, he becomes known as the Redeemer. When the Scorpion discovered Pardo is still alive, he chases after him. Pardo comes upon a villager, Agustin, menaced by thugs. After killing his attackers, they hide from the gang's retaliation in the house of Agustin's friend Antonia. Agustin explains that he found a bag full of money and took it to a local church to donate. Pardo offers to trade the money back to the gang in return if they leave the town. Though they refuse to leave, they agree to bargain once the money is recovered. When they realize that Pardo is the Redeemer, they keep him under heavy guard while several men fetch the money. They fail to find the money, and Pardo kills all the men in the room before they can shoot him. The gang's boss, an American named Steve Bradock, dismisses his henchmen's fears and orders them to kill Pardo. Pardo returns to find that Agustin has given the money to Antonia to help her son get an operation. Pardo initially refuses to allow her to keep it, but he relents after she unknowingly reminds him of slaughtered family. Agustin and Antonia watch as Pardo engages in his ritualistic Russian roulette, and Antonia tells him that he must accept his dark side and forgive himself rather than looking to God for a sign that he has been forgiven. Knowing that the entire gang must be killed if they allow Antonia to keep the money, Pardo researches the gang's next drug deal, where he defeats one of Bradock's assassins. Meanwhile, the Scorpion arrives in town and kills anyone who gets in his way. Realizing that both the Redeemer and Scorpion are in town, Bradock's second-in-command urges him to flee. Instead, Bradock kills him, promotes underling Piedra, and demands that his men come up with a cool- sounding nickname for him, too. After Pardo clears out a warehouse, Piedra and Pardo engage in a duel. After Pardo wins, he learns from Piedra the location Bradock's headquarters. There, Pardo realizes the Scorpion has already killed Bradock. The Scorpion knocks him out. When Pardo awakes, he sees that Agustin and Antonia are both prisoners. The Scorpion reveals that he has been killing all the people that Pardo has helped, which he says proves the futility of Pardo's redemption. The Scorpion demands Agustin to play Russian roulette; when he refuses, the Scorpion wounds Antonia and finally kills Agustin. The Scorpion demands Antonia play under threat of Pardo's death, but Pardo points out that the Scorpion would never kill him without making him suffer. Both Antonia and the Scorpion are disarmed, and the two men face off. Pardo defeats the Scorpion, and Antonia hands him the stylized pistol. Instead of killing him, Pardo apologizes for killing his son and gives the Scorpion back his pistol, saying that it is all he can do to reunite the Scorpion with his son. A gunshot is heard as Pardo and Antonia leave.  Cast  * Marko Zaror as Nicky Pardo * Noah Segan as Bradock * Jose Luis Mosca as the Scorpion * Loreto Aravena as Antonia * Mauricio Diocares as Agustin * Smirnow Boris as Piedra  Production  On March 18, 2014, XYZ Films announced Redeemer, which Marko Zaror would star in and Ernesto Diaz Espinoza direct. On March 26, Noah Segan joined the cast of the film. The filming began on March 24, 2014, in Pichidangui, Chile, and ended in the mid-May.  Release  Redeemer premiered in September 2014 at Fantastic Fest. It received a limited release in the US on 12 June 2015.  Reception  Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called the action scenes \\"thrilling to watch\\" and singled out Zaror's performance as a breakout role. Ethan Alter of Film Journal International wrote that Redeemer updates vigilante films to adapt to popular superhero film tropes but lacks a timely statement to interest viewers. Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times called it lame and derivative action film with contrived scenes that force the characters to resort to martial arts. Simon Abrams of The Village Voice wrote, \\"Redeemer may not be as good as its star, but it does give Zaror enough room to shine.\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote that the film has \\"full-throttle action\\" but \\"feels a tad-bit undercooked\\".

The major feature of Eco-Block is to catalyze the nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in air into non-hazardous substances. Eco-Block has been mainly used as paving brick in pedestrians and vehicular areas in Hong Kong and it is now the 3rd generation. Manufacturing =Material= The major constituents of the Eco-Block are recycled glass and recycled aggregate from construction and demolition waste. Apart from that, a small quantity of photocatalyst is used on the surface layer of the eco-block.The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Retrieved 2014-03-11 =Producing process= A mechanized molding method is used for producing the Eco-Block. The materials are mixed with water and fly ash in a fixed proportion. Then the mixed materials will be molded under a combined vibrating and compacting action. Before put into use, the eco-block needs to be cured under suitable condition.Laputa Eco-Construction Materials Co. Ltd Retrieved 2014-03-11 =Coating= On the surface layer, there is a special coating made from titanium oxide (TiO2). When activated by the sunlight, the titanium oxide can catalyze the decomposition of nitrous oxides into oxygen, water, sulphur, nitrates and other non-toxic solid compounds which can be washed away by water.HKUSCIENTIST Retrieved 2014-03-15 Development Eco-Block has currently undergone three generations and each generation has a slightly different composition. In general, all the generations made up of local construction waste. In the second generation, recycled glass powder from recycled glass bottles were added in the incorporation in Eco-Block for making its outlook more appealing and providing a wider range of usages of it. In the third generation, a photo-catalyst was added in the production process which catalyzes a chemical reaction and helps improve the air quality in Hong Kong. Features Eco-Block is a construction material and its surface layer is made of sand, glass sand, fly ash and cement while the base layer is made of coarse aggregate, sand, glass sand, fly ash and cement. =De-polluting effect= Eco-block can remove air pollutant such as nitrogen oxide, which causes acid rain. Eco-block converts toxic air pollutants into harmless compounds by decomposition. Also, it help to reduce exhaust gases from roadside vehicles. =Alleviate pressure of landfill= Eco-Block is made of daily activated sludge inside waste water plant, recycled glasses and construction waste. Therefore, Eco-block utilizes waste in manufacturing and reduces pressure in landfills.Hong Kong Polytechnic University Retrieved 2014-03-20 =Save coal consumption= Since Eco-Block has a relatively high compressive strength, it reduce the coal consumption in brick manufacturing. .The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Retrieved 2014-03-13 Applications of Eco-Block Local schools and education institutions starts to adopt Eco-Block for pavement such as The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. ‚ÄúEco-blocks for Eco-schools‚Äù, which is a joint programme held by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and HSBC Insurance, aims at improved environment and air quality of schools with the use of the Eco-Block since 2008.

When Samuel Howell married Sarah Stretch in 1745, he was a hatter, but became a merchant and importer, and rose to prominence becoming one of the leading and wealthiest merchants of his time. Typical advertisements Samuel Howell placed in the Pennsylvania Gazette show the wide variety of goods and services he offered, examples being on October 24, 1751, page 2 and October 18, 1753, page 3 announcing a large variety of goods, which he had just imported from London, for sale in his shop at the \\"Sign of the Beaver in Chestnut Street\\", located at the corner of Chestnut Street and Strawberry Alley. A Quaker, Samuel was disowned by his meeting on 12 September 1762 for \\"fitting out his ships in a warlike manner\\"; his wife was disowned four years later. :\\"Whereas Samuel Howell of this city merchant, professeth himself convinced of the Christian testimony of Friends against Wars of Fighting, yet persists in fitting out his ships in a warlike manner for which he hath been long treated with in much love and tenderness, and the inconsistency of his conduct laid before him, but as he does not show a proper regard to the advice of friends by discontinuing the practice, and no grounds to expect his compliance therewith, this meeting for the clearing of truth disowns the said Samuel Howell being in religious fellowship with us, until from strict sense of his breach of our testimony he shall seek to be reconciled to friends, and condemns the same to the satisfaction of this meeting, which it is our desire he may be enabled to do, by a more steady attention to the dictates of the peaceable principle of the gospel in his own heart.\\" He was drawn into the political life of pre-Revolutionary Philadelphia. In 1765 Samuel Howell \\"the Merchant\\" was a signer of the historic Resolution of Non-Importation Made by the Citizens of Philadelphia, October 25, 1765,http://digitalhistory.hsp.org/pafrm/doc/resolution-non- importation-made-citizens-philadelphia-october-25-1765 and one of the prominent merchants selected to solicit other signers and to see that the agreement was put into effect. He was a member of the local Committee on Correspondence in 1774, Committee of Safety in 1775 and served as a member, 1776-1777. The Committee of Safety was, in fact, a board of war, and had the direction of military affairs in the province. and in 1776 elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. He served as chairman of the Philadelphia Committee of Safety and member of the Pennsylvania Council of Safety, discharging executive duties of the state government during the Revolution. Two days after his appointment, the Convention adopted the Declaration of Independence. After the evacuation of Philadelphia by the British he served as a member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Howell gave his family's silver to make the first U. S. Currency. Samuel Howell became a contributor to Pennsylvania Hospital in 1754, was one of its Board of Managers, 1784-9, and President of the Board 1786-9. In 1757 Samuel Howell was a signer of Pennsylvania colonial currency. Notes totaling ¬£45,000 were authorized March 10, 1757, a total of 72,825 notes, to be signed by any three of twenty-four signers, one of who was Samuel Howell. In 1788 Howell was one of the port wardens of Philadelphia, and on March 19, 1791, was appointed by President George Washington as a Commissioner of the Bank of the United States. Howell became a member of the Schuylkill Fishing Company, member No. 133 elected May 1, 1769. His father-in- law's brother, Thomas Stretch, was the founding Governor, member No. 1 elected May 1, 1732; father-in-law Joseph Stretch was member No. 14, elected May 1, 1732, son-in-law Peter Stretch II (1746-1793), member No. 128 elected May 1, 1769; and Samuel Howell's son, Samuel, Jr., member No. 150 elected March 10, 1784. After the Revolution, when the United States began to trade directly with China, Samuel Howell was an investor in many of the early ventures. In 1788, one of his ships, Sampson, captained by son Samuel Jr., was among the first to sail to China, leaving Philadelphia on November 28, 1788, and returning July 3, 1790. Advertisements in Dunlap's American Daily Advertiser in 1792 announced the sale of nankeens and several varieties of tea that he had imported from China in the ship Sampson. In addition to his residence and store at 54 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, he owned another lot with stores and a wharf on the east side of Water Street. The Pennsylvania Museum of Art collection of several pieces of China imported by Samuel Howell and his son can be seen here. He possessed a large landed and personal estate, the latter alone, as shown by the account of his executors, amounting to over $284,000. In today's terms this sum indicates a wealth of $8.1 billion, excluding the value of massive land holdings. In his Last Will and Testament, Samuel Howell chronicalized three generations of his family, distributing to his surviving children and grandchildren portions of his estate, in many instances with specificity. In his six-page Will, recorded in Philadelphia Will Book Z, at pp 210‚Äì213 :12 Dec 1807 - \\"Samuel Howell of the City and County of Philadelphia . . . bequeaths to my daughter Sarah Stretch widow of Peter Stretch . . .\\" [pg 210] :\\". . . bequeaths to the Contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital . . .\\" [pg 211] (on whose Board he served, 1784-1789) :\\". . .grandson Samuel E.

His decease is noted in the Philadelphia Aurora of 14 December 1807: \\"DIED - at his seat, (Tacony near Frankford) on the ninth instant, in the 85th year of his age, SAMUEL HOWELL, Esq., for many years a Merchant of great respectability in this city.\\" Samuel Howell and Sarah Stretch were married in the presence of their parents at Friends' Meeting, Philadelphia, on December 12, 1745. Their wedding certificate, a large document which all family members present signed, states: \\". . .Samuel Howell of the city of Philadelphia, and province of Pennsylvania, Hatter, son of Thomas Howell of Township Chichester in the County of Chester. . .\\". The signatures on this document include Samuel Howell's parents: Thomas Howell and Rachel Howell, and Sarah Stretch's parents Joseph and Lydia Stretch. Samuel's great-grandfather, also named Thomas Howell, emigrated to New Jersey arriving October 28, 1682. Thomas was from Tamworth, Staffordshire, England where he possessed a landed estate. He represented Gloucester County in the West Jersey Assembly in 1683 and 1685, at the time he acquired lands in West Jersey. Thomas died March 9, 1687 at Newton, Gloucester, New Jersey. His coat of arms, from England, is shown below. Arms granted to Thomas Howell Samuel Howell married Sarah Stretch (1733-1770), daughter of Joseph Stretch (1709-1771) and Lydia Knight, at Friends' Meeting, Philadelphia, on December 12, 1745. Samuel's wife, Sarah, died March 28, 1770 at the age of 37. Her father, Joseph Stretch, was the brother of Thomas Stretch. Children of Samuel and Sarah Howell: :A. Sarah Howell (1746-1825) married Peter Stretch II (1746-1793), son of Thomas Stretch and Mary Ann Robbins. She died at Burlington, New Jersey in April, 1825. Children: :# Elizabeth Stretch :# Joseph H. Stretch, deceased by 1818. :# Mary Howell Stretch (1778-1843), married Theodorus Van Wyck (1776-1840). Theodorus Van Wyck's grandfather was Pierre Van Cortlandt (1721-1814), Lieutenant Governor of New York, 1777-1795.

As demonstrated in documents cites above, including his Last Will and Testament, it is Samuel Howell the Merchant whose business was based at the Sign of the Beaver, located at the corner of Chestnut Street and Strawberry, which was among the properties he bequeathed at the time of his death in 1807. Among the source documents and research confirming this are birth records, will and probate records and other sources cited above. Samuel Howell (1718-1780) died eleven years before President Washington bestowed a Commission to Samuel Howell, the financier and merchant, as a Commissioner of the United States Bank. The confusion arises from Jonathan Howell's unsourced family genealogy conflating these two Samuel Howells. Sadly, this error has been relied upon by some without further study. by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania - Philadelphia's Library of American History As demonstrated by his Last Will and Testament, Samuel Howell \\"the Merchant\\" and his family continued to own and occupy his property at \\"The Sign of the Beaver\\", corner of Chestnut and Strawberry, which he bequeathed in 1807 to a grandson. :12 Dec 1807 - \\"Samuel Howell of the City and County of Philadelphia . . . bequeaths to my daughter Sarah Stretch widow of Peter Stretch . . .\\" [pg 210] :\\". . . bequeaths to the Contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital . . .\\" [pg 211] (on whose Board he served, 1784-1789) :\\". . .grandson Samuel E.

He removed to Philadelphia, where he established himself as an importer and merchant, and rose to prominence, becoming one of the leading and wealthiest merchants of his time. Location of the \\"Sign of the Beaver\\" at Strawberry Alley and Chestnut Street, and the Crooked Billet Dock. Howell's father-in-law, Thomas Stretch, was initially located as a clockmaker at Peter Stretch's Corner, at Front and Chestnut Streets, inherited in 1746 from his father. Around 1747-8 Thomas sold his father's property and moved a block further west, to the southwest corner of Second and Chestnut, one block east of Howell's property. Detail from \\"Plan of the City of Philadelphia and its Environs (Showing the Improved Parts),\\" 1797. Samuel Howell's advertisement printed by Benjamin Franklin, Pennsylvania Gazette, October 11, 1753 Howell opened a mercantile business located at Strawberry Alley and Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, at the \\"Sign of the Beaver\\" involved in importing goods, providing transportation to Europe by sea and other activities. An idea of the extent and variety of merchandise imported and sold by Howell for decades between the 1740s and early 1800s can be seen in his advertisements, such as one in the Pennsylvania Gazette, printed by Benjamin Franklin October 11, 1753 (at left) and another on October 18, 1753, transcribed below: By the mid 18th-century, Howell was diversifying his business and investing in real estate. In addition to vast swaths of farm land and commercial buildings, he acquired the famous Crooked Billet Tavern and Inn, and surrounding land, which demonstrate the extent to which he expanded. In Philadelphia's early years there were no separate buildings which served as dance halls, theaters, or clubs ‚Äî taverns, instead, provided all-purpose service. Until the Revolutionary War era, taverns and inns were the largest public buildings in Philadelphia. Drinking establishments in Colonial Philadelphia, be they in the form of coffee houses, taverns, or unlicensed \\"tippling houses\\", were more than places to drink and dine. Taverns were where the community conducted business, got its news, argued politics, attended concerts and auctions, socialized, or just plain got polluted. Between Market and Chestnut Streets the embankment staircase of the Crooked Billet Steps rose from the Crooked Billet Wharf to the Tavern. The Crooked Billet public landing, located at the foot of Chestnut Street, was a bustling wharf where sailing ships docked to off-load their goods and passengers, and took on -board passengers bound for Europe. Regular water taxis sailed from Philadelphia to the New Jersey shore. This pier extended from Water Street onto the Delaware River roughly one hundred feet north of the bottom of Chestnut Street. The original wharf, warehouses and an inn were built by Alice Guest c 1690. The Crooked Billet Tavern and Inn is where, in 1723, Benjamin Franklin had his first hot meal and spent his first night in Philadelphia. At one time, it was the tavern of longest uninterrupted operation in the city. The Crooked Billet Tavern was located on the site of the present 35 South Front Street, not quite one hundred and fifty feet north of Chestnut Street, and had a frontage of twenty-four feet on both Front and Water streets. Since the tavern had been accommodating strangers as early as 1690, it was reputed to be one of the oldest taverns in town. Pennsylvania was the overwhelming choice of German immigrants during the middle half of the eighteenth century and Samuel Howell was active in transporting these immigrants. Between 1727 and 1775 there were 317 German immigrant voyages employing 190 different captains. Quite a diverse group of large and small, Philadelphia and non- Philadelphia merchants, were engaged in shipping German immigrants to Philadelphia. When the ships docked at Philadelphia the redemptioner servants were consigned to local merchants who collected the amounts due from their sale. Prepaying passengers did not have to be consigned. A few merchants specialized in the trade. As a group Stedman, Shoemaker, Willing & Morris, Samuel Howell, and Daniel Beneset gained around 60 percent of the consignments. Between 1763-1774 Howell had twelve ships carrying a total of 810 adult male immigrants. Proponent, leader and financier of the American Revolution Early on, Howell manifested sympathy for the colonies in their opposition to the exactions and oppressions of the English government, and when the attempt was made to enforce the Stamp Act in Pennsylvania he aligned with those determined to resist its demands. On October 25, 1765 the merchants and traders of Philadelphia subscribed to the historic Resolution of Non- Importation Made by the Citizens of Philadelphia, which he signed, and was one of the prominent merchants selected as a committee to solicit other signers and to see that the agreement was put into effect, consisting of Thomas Willing, Samuel Mifflin, Thomas Montgomery, Samuel Howell, Samuel Wharton, John Rhea, William Fisher, Joshua Fisher, Peter Chevalier, Benjamin Fuller and Abel James. This level of resistance activity exhausted the patriotism of many merchants, particularly those of the Quaker faith, but not that of Samuel Howell, who, when more heroic measures became necessary, was found among the foremost of those who planned to oppose and defeat the will of the Crown. Howell was also part of the committee responsible for enforcing the Resolution. Undoubtedly the decision was made at the expense of his business because, as can be understood reading his advertisements, once he signed the Non-Importation Resolution he lost access to many of the manufactured goods from England that would have been sold in his shop. The boycott proved to be successful, and British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766. Howell was chosen a member of the Committee on Correspondence, composed of forty-three leading citizens. Steps were immediately taken by this body for a convention (or conference, as it was called), to be composed of delegates elected in the several counties of the Province. Howell was elected from Philadelphia, and participated in the convention which met at Carpenters' Hall 15 July 1774, with Thomas Willing as chairman. By the vote of the convention, the delegates from Philadelphia were constituted a Committee on Correspondence for the province, and Howell remained a member of this important body until 3 July 1775, when it was succeeded by a Council of Safety, of which Benjamin Franklin was the chairman. Howell was active in the business of the Council, which was that of raising, arming, and equipping troops, creating a navy, building fortifications, procuring the munitions of war, etc. Samuel Howell not only voted for such measures, but he served on special committees in furtherance of these ends. The level of his activity is seen in the Minutes of the meeting on November 7, 1775, some of which services are outlined in the following extracts from the proceedings of the council: Howell continued a member of the Council until 22 July 1776. He was then re-elected, but declined the honor. During the same year he was elected to the assembly, receiving the highest vote in the poll. Meeting of Citizens in Philadelphia - November 2, 1775 A transcription of the broadside issued stated: Broadside announcing meeting held November 2, 1775 in Philadelphia Contemplating the evacuation of Philadelphia by the British, George Washington, in correspondence to Henry Laurens, President of the Continental Congress, from Valley Forge, June 1, 1778, wrote: Financier Samuel Howell, sensing problems at the outset of the Revolutionary War, adroitly conveying his property for safekeeping to Hope & Company, the Amsterdam banking house of Henry Hope, the richest man in Europe at the time. Baring Brothers, the English merchant banking house, acted as agent for Hope & Company after the war purchasing large amounts of American land and discounted securities. When the British occupied Philadelphia early in the war, Howell was taken prisoner even though he was a Quaker. Important Revolutionary War financial instruments made to Samuel Howell and some signed by him include Continental Bills of Exchange used to pay interest on the United States debt in French Francs loaned to the fledgling United States by Louis XVI for that express purpose. In 1781, as a Director of the Bank of North America, Howell was called upon to save the country's finances. The Bank, issued a charter by the Continental Congress and the State of Pennsylvania, made loans from its capital and supplied the need for a circulating medium by issuing notes on the credit of its stock. After the Revolutionary War, his property still safe in the hands of Hope & Company, and armed with letters of credit from Hope, some men seemed jealous that Howell was thought to have more money than he really had. When the first bank in this country, the Bank of North America (est. 1782) refused to discount some prominent Philadelphian's notes, a group of those excluded tried to start a new bank to compete with the exclusive Bank of North America in 1784-5. In a letter to Alexander Hamilton dated January 17, 1784, Gouverneur Morris explained: > Howell transferred his Property to the House of Hopes (House of Hope, a > Dutch banking house founded by Henry Hope) in Amsterdam at the beginning of > the American Revolution. With them it remained during the War and in return, > several Dutch men have brought him Letters of Recommendation from that > House. This circumstance has raised the Idea that he possesses great Credit > abroad, which Credit will, it is supposed give Stability to the Bank. Be > this as it may, he is said to be an honest Man, which is no bad thing in any > Case. On March 19, 1791, Howell was appointed by President Washington a commissioner of the First Bank of the United States. President George Washington's Commission appointing Samuel Howell a Commissioner of the Bank of the United States dated March 19, 1791 Transcription: Alexander Hamilton arranging for the commissions to be signed by President Washington: Howell was one of three commissioners chosen by George Washington for the taking of subscriptions for this new bank. Nothing came of this first freedom of competition movement when a compromise solution was reached between the two rival banking groups and those originally denied banking privileges were allowed to buy into the Bank of North America at the same price as the original stockholders ($400/share), a considerable sum for that era.

History The main part of the building (designed by George Temple-Poole) was constructed in 1896 and opened in January 1897. It replaced the first courthouse on the site built in 1867 from plans by Richard Roach Jewell. The site had also been the location of a convict hiring depot; one of four established in the colony after convicts were introduced in 1850. In 1902, after only 5 years of use, the last resident magistrate was withdrawn and the building was vacated. Many of the records that had been stored in the building were lost in the ensuing years. Surrounding buildings associated with the convict depot also declined, the old warders' quarters were demolished around 1931. Toodyay Court House c1930 (At far right can be seen a section of the Toodyay Convict Depot Warder's Quarters, which were demolished around August 1931.) In October 1956 the Under Secretary for Law (Mr Green) and Resident Magistrate, Northam (Keith Hamilton Hogg) met to discuss the restoration of the Court House after the Toodyay Health Inspector reported on the bad state of the building's drains. In 1957 the Minister for Works approved the proposal for the Crown Law Department and the Toodyay Road Board to share the use of the Toodyay Court House. Most of the projected cost estimates for renovations were to be shared between the Public Works Department (¬£750) and the Road Board (¬£150) with a total cost of ¬£1,000. The Board would have a 10-year lease of the building (with a right of renewal) for ¬£5 or ¬£10 per annum. The Board later accepted the terms offered. In 1958 the Public Works Department let the contract to Mr Broderick for the removal of an old building adjacent to the Court House. This building, constructed in 1854 as the Toodyay Convict Depot Infirmary, was Toodyay's first public hospital. (The purpose built Newcastle Hospital replaced it in 1896.) The old building was then used as a drill room and store and later as the home of Norman Campbell until his death in May 1958. On 1 January 1959 the Toodyay Road Board moved into the restored Court House building. In 1985 additions were made to the eastern end of the building by Spadaccini Bros of Northam. The tendered amount was $104,130 to add 120m2 of office space. English bond style brickwork was used to complement the original 1896 Court House. Description The building is a single storey building constructed of brick with a corrugated iron hipped roof in a Federation Free Classical style. The building sits upon a rendered plinth and has stuccoed archways, keystones and string courses with feature timber cornices. Heritage value The former Court House building was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) on 7 June 1977 and included on the Shire of Toodyay's Municipal Heritage Inventory on 27 August 1998. On 14 February 2003 it was placed on the permanent state heritage register. In 2010, an archaeological excavation of a site around and including the former court building revealed the foundations of the convict depot. The entire site was added to the state heritage register in June 2014.

It is a native of North and Central America and is generally considered a weed. Description Acalypha ostryifolia is an annual herb reaching a height of up to 75 cm tall. The stems are upright, branching, purplish-green with vertical striations, short recurved hairs and stalked glands. Its leaves are alternate, petiolate, simple and ovate, with serrate or dentate margins, a cordate base and slight pubescence, and grow to 10 cm in length. Male and female flowers are in separate spikes, the staminate, males on short axillary spikes and the pistillate females in elongated, interrupted, terminal spikes. The male flowers have four ovate greenish sepals often tinged red and no petals. The female flowers are also petal-less but have three styles which subdivide into white hairs which give the inflorescence a furry appearance. Its 3-lobed capsule is depressed-globose to ovoid, grows up to 5 mm across, with typically 3 ovoid, wrinkled seeds that are around 2 mm in length and brown with low bumpy ridges.

It has been introduced to Southern Italy.Plants of Italy - Flora italiana Acalypha ostryifolia grows in riverbanks, fields, bluffs, roadsides, canyons and slopes. It can be adventive in cultivated fields, where it can be a pest species. Ecology The hophornbeam copperleaf is a summer weed growing in cultivated fields and waste places. It has a high germination rate and the seedlings are resistant to cold and grow as fast as soybean plants in the Midwest. It is resistant to most of the herbicides used in soybean crops with the exception of lactofen, acifluorfen and fomesafen, which controlled over 80%. Lactofen was the most successful of these with a kill rate of 95%.Hophornbean Copperleaf (Acalypha ostryaefolia) Biology and Control The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) commonly lays eggs on this plant when it grows near sweet corn crops in Kentucky. Research has shown that the insect favoured the weed over the corn, even though it was not infested by aphids on which the larvae could feed. The larvae were found to fall from the weeds and crawl across the soil before climbing sweet corn plants. The presence of the weed in close proximity to the crop was beneficial and resulted in more beetle larvae on the crop and fewer aphids than was the case when the weed was absent.Factors influencing dispersal of larval Coleomegilla maculata from the weed Acalypha ostryaefolia to sweet corn Gallery Image:Acalypha_ostryifolia_female.JPGfemale inflorecence Image:Acalypha_ostryifolia_male.JPGmale inflorescence Image:Acalypha_ostryifolia_topview.JPGyoung plant, topview References External links * Virginia Tech Weed Identification Guide ostryifolia Category:Flora of the Caribbean Category:Flora of Central America Category:Flora of Mexico Category:Flora of the United States Category:Flora of the Southeastern United States Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States ","title":"Acalypha ostryifolia"},{"id":"42322634","text":"is a former Japanese professional baseball player.

Ravichandran along with Juhi Chawla pairing together again after the successful previous film Premaloka (1988). The supporting cast features Lokesh, Doddanna, Abhinaya and Mukhyamantri Chandru among others. The film was presented and produced by N. Veeraswamy under his home production \\"Eshwari Productions\\". The film featured original score and soundtrack composed and written by Hamsalekha. The film failed to live up to the hype and expectations that had been created due to the team's previous blockbuster film Premaloka.  Plot  Kindari Jogi (V. Ravichandran) is a mythical person with superpowers. He lives in the world of children, music, art and happiness and never hesitates to do a good deed. Through his assistant, he happens to find Ravi (V. Ravichandran again), who does odd jobs for a living. Ravi had left his village Hanumapura so as to earn money for his sister's marriage. Due to Ravi's so called communist approach towards life, Kindari Jogi decides not to give him a huge amount of money for free, but go to his village and solve the problems. Kindari Jogi in guise of Ravi reaches Hanumapura, a village that houses eccentric humans, a village where relations do not have much value, a village where drinking water is a major headache. The village is divided into two factions led by Rudrappa (Lokesh) and Devayya (Sundar Raj). Kindari Jogi falls in love with Ganga (Juhi Chawla), Deva's sister, with whose help he unites the two factions. He also gets the support of the children in the village. Afterwards after a prolonged drama, he manages to conduct his sister's (Ravi's sister's) marriage with her boyfriend and conduct a grand festival at the Lord Hanuman temple. However, a small misconception reignites the feud between the two factions, who begin to question each other's authority over the temple and keep it closed until a proper decision is taken. Eventually Kindari Jogi opens the temple by singing a song and goes inside along with Ganga and all the children in the village, where he transforms to his original form and takes them to his world. The villagers who witness these incidents are worried when they do not return from the temple. The real Ravi returns to his village at this scenario confusing the people who are mourning the loss of their children. The people who believe him to be a black magician drive him away asking him never to come back. As a confused Ravi runs for his life a villager throws a knife which eventually strikes a wall in Kindari Jogi's world.  Cast  * V.

Life Born at Edinburgh on 4 August 1825, he was second of three sons of James Neil, an Edinburgh bookseller, by his wife Sarah Lindsay. After the death of the father from cholera in 1832, the family went to live in Glasgow. Neil was educated at Glasgow grammar school, and then entered Glasgow University; as an undergraduate he assisted the English master in the high school and worked for the Glasgow Argus where Charles Mackay was editor, and other newspapers. For a time Neil was a private tutor and then master successively of Falkirk charity school in 1850, of Southern Collegiate School, Glasgow, in 1852, and of St. Andrew's School, Glasgow, in 1853. Hee was rector of Moffat Academy from 1855 to 1873. At the same Neil worked at journalism. He promoted in 1857, and edited during its existence, the Moffat Register and Annandale Observer, the first newspaper published in Moffat, and wrote regularly for other Scottish periodicals and educational journals. In 1850 Neil launched the British Controversialist (40 vols. in all, edited by Neil to 1873). It was a monthly magazine, published in London, for the discussion of literary, social, and philosophical questions. On resigning his rectorship of Moffat Academy in 1873 Neil settled in Edinburgh, devoting himself to English literature, and especially to Shakespeare. He founded and was president of the Edinburgh Shakespeare Society, and gave the annual lecture from 1874 till his death. Neil was well known in educational, academic and philanthropic circles in Edinburgh, and helped to found the Educational Institute of Scotland. In 1900 his health failed. He died on 28 August 1901, while on a visit at Sullom Manse, Shetland, and was buried in Sullom churchyard. Works Neil collected articles from the British Controversialist in books. Of those, his Art of Reasoning (1853) was praised for its concision. In the 1860s he continued with a series \\"Modern Logicians\\". It noticed, with figures better known at the time, George Boole, Joseph John Murphy, and William Thomson. Other compiled works of this kind were Elements of Rhetoric (1856), Composition and Elocution (1857; 2nd edit. 1857), and Public Meetings and how to conduct them (1867). A series of Neil's papers from 1860 was reissued in 1861 as Shakespeare: a Critical Biography, which accepted the forgeries of John Payne Collier; it was translated into French and German. He also issued a guide to Shakespeare's birthplace at Stratford-on-Avon as Home of Shakspere described (Warwick, 1871), and he edited the Library Shakespeare (3 vols.) in 1875, besides some of the plays for school use. Other works by Neil included: * Cyclop√¶dia of Universal History, 1855; 2nd edit. 1857 (with Isaiah MacBurney). * Synopsis of British History, 1856. * Student's Handbook of Modern History, 1857. * The Young Debater, 1863. * Culture and Self-culture, 1863. * Martin Luther, 1863. * Epoch Men and the Results of their Lives, 1865. * The Art of Public Speaking, 1867. * The Debater's Handbook and Controversialist Manual, 1874; new edition 1880. Neil edited and compiled most of The Home Teacher, a Cyclop√¶dia of Self-instruction (1886, 6 vols).

U.S. District Judge Michael J. McShane ruled on May 19, 2014, that Oregon's constitution and statutes restricting marriage rights for same-sex couples violate the U.S. Constitution and ordered an immediate end to their enforcement. The National Organization for Marriage, an organization opposed to same-sex marriage, tried without success to intervene in the suit, to stay enforcement of the district court decision, and to appeal that decision.  Filing  Deanna Geiger and Janine Nelson, lead plaintiffs in Geiger v. Kitzhaber Geiger v. Kitzhaber was filed on October 15, 2013, by Deanna Geiger and Janine Nelson, a lesbian couple wanting to marry in Oregon, and by William Griesar and Robert Duehmig, a gay male couple together for 25 years who had married in Canada. The case was filed in the United States District Court of Oregon. The case claims that Oregon's constitutional ban on same gender marriage, Article 15, ¬ß 5, and all Oregon marriage statutes referring to husband and wife that government officials interpreted in a way that excluded full and equal marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples, violate the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The couples named as defendants Governor John Kitzhaber, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, Jennifer Woodward, State Registrar, and Randy Walruff, Multnomah County Assessor. Recognition of out-of-state marriages The next day, October 16, the state's Chief Operating Officer Michael Jordan directed state agencies to \\"recognize all out-of-state marriages for the purposes of administering state programs. That includes legal, same-sex marriages performed in other states and countries.\\" He cited an opinion by the Oregon Department of Justice dated the same day. According to that opinion, Jordan had inquired whether, in the light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor and the fact that California and Washington were recognizing same-sex marriages, Oregon could recognize same-sex marriages established in other jurisdictions. Deputy Attorney General Mary H. Williams, writing on behalf of the Department of Justice, replied to his inquiry saying: \\"We cannot identify any legitimate (much less compelling) state interest in requiring that each marriage recognized in Oregon contain one partner of each sex. We conclude that state agencies can recognize these marriages as valid. To do otherwise would likely violate the federal constitution.\\"  Consolidation  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Michael J. McShane. Two months after Geiger was filed, two additional couples and the Basic Rights Education Fund filed another lawsuit, Rummell v. Kitzhaber, again alleging that Oregon's ban on same-sex marriages was unconstitutional. The Rummell plaintiffs asked the court to consolidate their case with the Geiger case. The Geiger plaintiffs objected to the consolidation because it would cause a delay in the ruling. On January 22, 2014, Judge McShane consolidated the two cases. The plaintiffs in both Geiger and Rummell filed motions asking for summary judgment, since no facts were in dispute. Attorney General's response On February 20, 2014, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum filed an answer to the Rummell plaintiffs' complaint in which she conceded that Oregon's laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage were unconstitutional. She told the court that she believed \\"that performing same-sex marriages in Oregon would have no adverse effect on existing marriages, and that sexual orientation does not determine an individual's capacity to establish a loving and enduring relationship.\\" She found it impossible to defend the state's \\"under any standard of review\\" and her office would no longer defend the ban in court. Speaking publicly, she announced that the \\"Oregon Department of Justice will not defend the prohibition in our state's constitution against marriages between people of the same sex.\\"  Oral arguments  On April 23, 2014, Judge Michael McShane heard oral argumentsOral arguments on the motions for summary judgment in the consolidated lawsuit. While all parties present supported same-sex marriage, Judge McShane questioned whether there was a role for Oregon voters who had approved the amendment defining marriage in 2004 and considered whether to implement his ruling immediately or stay his ruling and await guidance from related cases pending in the U.S. courts of appeal. The court scheduled another session of oral arguments for May 14, where the National Organization for Marriage (\\"NOM\\"), an organization that opposes same-sex marriage, tried without success to qualify for intervention in the case. McShane ruled that the group was unreasonably late in filing its request to intervene and that it failed to convincingly demonstrate that it should be allowed to intervene on behalf of three anonymous Oregon-based members of NOM. Ruling The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on May 19, resulting in the immediate legalization of same-sex marriage in Oregon. Judge McShane departed from the common descriptor of \\"same-sex\\" throughout his opinion,opinion using instead the terms same-gender marriage and same-gender couples. His opinion included several paragraphs designed for the public: Minutes after the decision was announced at noon, officials in at least four counties were fulfilling requests for marriage licenses from same-sex couples. Multnomah County issued 96 licenses the first day, and judges officiated at wedding ceremonies at six altars set up in a Portland ballroom. Deanna Geiger and Janine Nelson were the first to marry after Judge McShane's ruling. Appeals On May 4, 2014, while the Geiger case was still pending in district court, the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) filed an appeal of the district court's denial of intervenor status in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Once Judge McShane released his May 19, 2014, order, NOM immediately sought a stay of that order from the Ninth Circuit, which denied that emergency motion that same day. The state defendants, including Governor Kitzhaber, joined by the plaintiffs, moved the next day to dismiss NOM's appeal as moot. They argued that Judge McShane was correct in denying NOM intervenor status, and that therefore NOM lacked standing and its appeal was moot. On August 27, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals, consisting of U.S. Circuit Judges Schroeder, Thomas, and N.R. Smith, agreed and granted the motion dismissing the appeal.NOM v. Geiger v. Kitzhaber - 9th Cir. Order Granting State's Motion to Dismiss NOM's Appeal On May 27, 2014, NOM filed an application for an emergency stay with Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit. On June 4, Justice Kennedy referred the application to the full U.S. Supreme Court, which rejected the request for a stay without comment or recorded dissent on June 4. On November 24, 2014, the Ninth Circuit denied NOM's request for an initial hearing en banc. On December 3, 2014, the Ninth Circuit issued the mandate finalizing its August 27 decision to dismiss NOM's appeal. On April 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court denied another NOM petition for review.  Attorneys  Lake Perriguey of Law Works LLC began working on the case in July 2013. He and Lea Ann Easton of Dorsay & Easton LLPDorsay & Easton LLP filed Geiger in October 2013. Tom JohnsonThomas Johnson and Misha Isaak of Perkins Coie LLP, and Jennifer Middleton of Johnson Johnson & Schaller PC,Jennifer Middleton together with ACLU staff attorneys Kevin Diaz, Amanda Goad, and Rose Saxe, filed Rummell in December 2013 on behalf of Basic Rights Education Fund and two other plaintiff couples.University of Michigan Law SchOOL: Case Profile: Geiger v.

Meaning Kasaya or KashƒÅya (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ø) means, 'astringent', 'decay', 'smearing', 'juice', 'degeneracy', 'anointing', 'gum', 'resin', 'red-brown', 'stupidity', 'defect', 'fragrant'. It also means 'attachment to worldly objects' or to 'the yellowish-red garments worn by monks'. Overview Sadananda defines Kasaya as attachment to worldly objects, the failure of the mental state to rest on the Absolute, owing to the numbness brought on by impressions due to attachment even when there is no torpidity or distraction (Vedantasara) (Sl.212). In Vedanta, the word Kasaya denotes metaphorically a rigid state of mind hardened by one's own inclinations and passions. Jiva Rishi Gautama Nodha (Rig Veda I.58.3) describes the Jiva in the following words:- :‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ ‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§≠‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•Å‡§≠‡§ø‡§É ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•ã‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡§æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ã ‡§∞‡§Ø‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ‡§≥‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É :‡§∞‡§•‡•ã ‡§® ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§µ‡•É‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∑‡•Å ‡§µ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∑‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ ‡§ã‡§£‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡§ø  :\\"That is the Jiva (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ ‚Äì the spotless achiever of good deeds) who should be known as the one who moves about (‡§®‡§ø‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§É) in the bodily form (‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡§æ) applying and enjoying all substances and thoughts (the gross and the fine) all the while attached to this earth or world (‡§µ‡§∏‡•Å‡§≠‡§ø‡§É) guided and impelled by the Pranas (‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§≠‡§ø‡§É) experiencing the varying stages of birth, growth, maturity etc., (‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∑‡•Å) and all attendant consequences (‡•†‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§®‡§É) with a view to enjoying the desired happiness and comfort though in reality by itself it is pure and undying. \\" And, Rishi Kumaro Yamayana (Rig Veda X.135.6) in the following mantra explains :‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§≠‡§µ‡§¶‡§®‡•Å‡§¶‡•á‡§Ø‡•Ä ‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§  :‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç ‡§¨‡•Å‡§ß‡•ç‡§® ‡§Ü‡§§‡§§‡§É ‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡§Ø‡§£‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç  that the Paramatman \\"universal Soul\\" is the primordial existence, remaining throughout creation, omnipresent, even as the Jivatman \\"individual Soul\\" dons a body and experiences bondage to \\"material objectives\\" and duality or (unknowing) of that omniprescence It is the Jiva, who by its actions, attracts to itself the pudgalas (the tendencies that keep an individual re- incarnating), which results in its bondage; all that one enjoys or suffers from are the products of karmas, good or bad. Gaudapada‚Äôs exposition Gaudapada (Gaudapada Karika III.44-45) warns that the seeker after truth should not linger on the bliss of Savikalpa Samadhi because that enjoyment (rasavada), after Laya, Vikshepa and Kasaya, is the fourth kind of obstacle in the path to Nirvikalpa Samadhi; one should be unattached through \\"viveka\\", discrimination. Attachment is a weakness of the mind as it is not easily disciplined to withdraw from the enjoyment and related effects arising out of desire. He explains: as in dreams where the mind vibrates with dual aspects, so too in the waking state these aspects seem to be all that there is but when the state of\\"nirati\\", dissolution of the mind is achieved, duality is no longer perceived. The conduct of the mind in deep sleep (when it loses itself) is not like its conduct in the controlled state (when it does not lose itself), and :‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ã ‡§® ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§®‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§® ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á  :‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§Ç ‡§§‡§¶‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç  :\\"there may be no duality where all mental activity ceases: then, the jivatma attaining oneness with the knowable Brahman becomes established in the Self, unborn and poised in equality\\" (Gaudapada Karika III.38). Torpidity or Laya (‡§≤‡§Ø) is overwhelm of the senses and the mental state, falling asleep unable to maintain awareness of the Absolute; and distraction or Vikshepa (‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§™) is through failing to be able to rest the mental state on the Absolute, resting it on other things. Significance Patanjali (Yoga Sutras II.2) ‚Äì ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø ‚Äì ‡§≠‡§µ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§É ‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§∂ ‚Äì ‡§§‡§®‡•Ç‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‚Äì assures that by cultivating the power of concentration the obstacles - which cause all suffering - in the way of enlightenment - can be removed. The obstacles he refers to are the negative effects of ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion and the desire to cling to life. And, as regards the enjoyment of bliss attained coinciding the gain of non-conceptual knowledge Sankara advocating the understanding of the depth-meaning (lakshyatha) of the Mahavakya Tat Twam Asi, states :‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡•ç‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§≠‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£‡§É  :‡§Ö‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡•ç‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß‡•à‡§ï‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£‡§É  :\\"What appears (as the Witness Consciousness within ‚Äì the individual Self), is of the nature of Bliss One- without- a- second; and the one that is the Bliss within is none other than the individualized self the Witnessing Consciousness within\\" ‚Äì which statement means that owing to the conditioning (vikshepa) in the Jiva, the individual can experience only the \\"awareness\\" and not the \\"bliss\\" aspect of Brahman.

EASF constitutes the regional operational arm of the peacekeeping elements of the African Peace and Security Architecture, put in place by the 2002 Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union.http://www.peaceau.org/uploads/psc-protocol-en.pdf (03/03/2014)http://www.easfcom.org/index.php/about-easf/history-and- background/21-about-us (03/03/2014) As of January 2018, EASF has ten member states: Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda. From April 2013, the Republic of South Sudan had the status of an observer and, according to EASF, was expected to eventually become a full member shortly. In June 2014, Somali Prime Minister Ahmed recommitted Somalia to the force during an African Union Summit in Equatorial Guinea. A follow-up meeting on troop contributions from the EASF member nations was conducted in August 2014. Evolution of EASF The predecessor of EASF, EASBRIG, was formed on September 10, 2004 through a Policy Framework between the member states, following the decision of the Summit of the African Union (AU) held in July of the same year in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. On April 11, 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between EASBRIG member states, which provided for three components : a Planning Element, Brigade Headquarters and Logistics Base. A decision of the Eastern Africa Council of Ministers of Defense and Security of March 30, 2007 directed the change of name of the institution from Brigade to Force (EASF) in line with a continental directive of the AU Council of Ministers of Defense and Security. It further established a Coordination Mechanism (EASFCOM), enlarging the number of EASF components to four. In order to reflect these changes and the multifaceted nature of the Force, a revised MoU and Policy Framework were signed in January 2011. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) laid out the legal framework for EASF. It also outlines the mode of establishment and management of the Force as well as the principles which guide the Force and the other organs of EASF.EASF (2011): Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment of the Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF) =Mandate= Article 13 of the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union (AU), signed in 2002, directs EASF to carry out the following functions: :* observation and monitoring missions; :* other types of peace support missions; :* intervention in a Member State in respect of grave circumstances or at the request of a Member State in order to restore peace and security, in accordance with Article 4(h) and (j) of the Constitutive Act; :* preventive deployment in order to prevent ::i. a dispute or a conflict from escalating, ::ii. an ongoing violent conflict from spreading to neighboring areas or States, and ::iii. the resurgence of violence after parties to a conflict have reached an agreement.; :* peace- building, including post-conflict disarmament and demobilization; :* humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of civilian population in conflict areas and support efforts to address major natural disasters; and :* any other functions as may be mandated by the Peace and Security Council or the Assembly. According to the Protocol, the ASF and EASF are encouraged to cooperate with the United Nations and its Agencies, other relevant international organizations and regional organizations, as well as with national authorities and NGOs, where appropriate. The detailed tasks of the ASF and its modus operandi for each authorized mission are to be considered and approved by the Peace and Security Council upon recommendation of the Commission. Organization EASF Decision Making Organs and Structures The MoU provides for three EASF policy-formulating, -controlling and -implementing organs:EASF (2011): Policy Framework for the Establishment of the Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF)(03/03/2014) and EASF (2011): Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment of the Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF) ;The Assembly of Eastern Africa Heads of State and Government The Assembly has the supreme authority over EASF. The Heads of State and Governments meet at least once a year to formulate policies, direct and control the functioning of EASF. In times of crisis, the assembly authorizes the deployment of the Force. ;The Eastern Africa Council of Ministers of Defense and Security The Council, which congresses at least twice a year, manages all aspects relating to EASF, appoints the Director and Heads of departments of EASFCOM as well as the Commander of EASBRIG. ;The Eastern Africa Committee of Chiefs of Defense Staff (EACDS) The EACDS serves as an advisory Military Committee of the Council and the Assembly. Its functions are to oversee, direct and manage EASFCOM on all technical matters as well as oversee, direct and manage the PLANELM, EASBRIG HQ and Logistic Base. While other regional ASF forces are implemented by Regional Economic Communities (RECs), namely ECOWAS, SADC, and ECCAS, with respective regional protocols already in place, the EASF is an entirely different regional arrangement, called Regional Mechanism (RM), that co-exists with several economic communities in East Africa that also implement security measures.http://www.issafrica.org/uploads/ASFPolBrief.pdf Since the 2007 decision of the Eastern Africa Council of Ministers of Defense and Security, EASF is composed of four components: EASFCOM, PLANELM, LOGBASE, and EASBRIG HQ.EASF (2011): Policy Framework for the Establishment of the Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF)(03/03/2014) =The EASF Secretariat = EASF coordination mechanism highway turnoff sign, Westwood Park Road, Nairobi, Kenya The Eastern Africa Standby Force Secretariat (EASFSEC) serves as the executive secretariat for the organisation.

It is based in Karen, Nairobi, (Kenya),http://www.easfcom.org/index.php/about-easf/easf- structures (03/03/2014) co-located with the Planning Element. It coordinates all EASF activities in consultation with concerned authorities of the Member States and the African Union (AU). It is mandated to implement all EASF policies, develop and reviews EASF policy documents to be approved by the Council of Ministers, and to mobilize financial and other resources in collaboration with the AU, Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and other partners. It also manages the EASF Fund, disseminates information and carries out public relation activities. EASFSEC is led by a Director and the Heads of Departments (Finance & Administration and Peace Operations Department). These are appointed by the Council of Ministers of Defense and Security.

Before Amb Chanfi was Mr. Maj-Gen (Rtd) Cyrille Ndayirukiye (Burundi, 3rd), Col Peter Marwa (Kenya, 2nd) and Mr. Simon Mulongo (1st).http://chimpreports.com/index.php/news/10204-easfcom-director-visits- jinja-district-leadership.html The management is assisted by a Legal Advisor, Military Advisor, Internal Auditor and an AU Liaison Officer. =Planning element= The Planning Element (PLANELM) of the Eastern Africa Standby Force is constituted as a \\"multi-national and multidimensional full-time planning headquarters\\". It is based in Nairobi, Kenya. PLANELM‚Äôs main function is to establish a Force that is capable of planning and preparation for those complex Peace Support Operations (PSOs) provided for in the six ASF mission scenarios. PLANELM is tasked with concept development, training coordination, reconnaissance, mission planning, mounting, deployment, employment & sustainment as well as recovery for/of the Military, Police, and Civilian Component. PLANELM comprises a military, police and civilian component, with personnel appointed by the EASF Member States. Beside the Heads of Components who are leading their respective component, a Joint Chief of Staff coordinates all three components. Active since 2004, the Military Component of the PLANELM mainly carries out force preparation and pre-deployment planning of EASF. Head of the component can be either a Chief of Staff, a military officer or Colonel. The Police Component of the EASF PLANELM, established in 2008, is tasked with the development of a fully functioning Police Component for PSOs that will be carried out in Eastern Africa or other African regions. It is led by someone with a rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police. Also established in 2008, the Civilian Component of the PLANELM, undertakes the planning of most civilian functions and procedures in an EASF PSO. Therefore, the Civilian Component is responsible for dealing with all political affairs, planning and coordinating of civilian activities, giving legal advice, informing the public and media, executing electoral management and -observation as well as dealing with all matters of civil affairs, child protection, and protection of civilians. This Component is led by a Civil Servant with the required qualifications and experience. The personnel for PLANELM is seconded by the Member States for a minimum period of one year. =Force Headquarters (EASF Force HQ)= The EASF Force Headquarters (EASF Force HQ) functions as the command headquarters for both preparation and operational command of the military arm of the multidimensional force, the \\"Standby Brigade\\". It is situated in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. EASF Force HQ is composed of military and civilian staff seconded by the EASF Member States. In case of deployment, the African Union (AU) or United Nations assume the operational control of the Brigade. EASF Force HQ works in close collaboration with PLANELM to prepare the structure and plans for a mission Headquarters. The deployment of the EASF is either mandated by the Assembly of EASF or the AU. If the AU mandates the deployment, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the AU is responsible for the appointment of the commander of the HQ. Each member state seconds officers to the EASF Force HQ for a period of two years.EASF (2011):Policy Framework for the Establishment of the Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF)(03/03/2014) =Logistic Base (LOGBASE)= Co-located with the Standby Brigade HQ in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the EASF Logistics Base functions as the central base for all logistic procedures of the Force - that is to maintain, store and manage the logistical infrastructure. Member States dispatch personnel, material and other resources to the Logistics Base to be maintained and provided for purposes of training and operations of the Force. If necessary, the base performs under the mandate and direct control of the African Union. Mission scenarios The Maputo Report and The Policy Framework for the Establishment of the African Standby Force (ASF) from May 2003 mentions six scenarios for the deployment of the regional contingents of the Force in Peace Support Operations (PSOs), ascending in their complexity of structures, management efforts and resources for deployment and sustainment.Policy Framework for the Establishment of the African Standby Force and the Military Staff Committee, Chapter 1 para. 1.6 *Scenario 1: AU/Regional military advice to a political mission *Scenario 2: AU/Regional observer mission co-deployed with a UN mission *Scenario 3: Stand-alone AU/Regional observer mission *Scenario 4: AU/Regional Peacekeeping force for Chapter VI and preventive deployment missions (and peace-building) *Scenario 5: AU peacekeeping force for complex multi-dimensional peacekeeping missions, including those involving low-level spoilers *Scenario 6: AU intervention, e.g. in genocide situations where the international community does not act promptly As long-term goals for the deployment of the Force, it was planned that scenario 1-4 should be able to deploy in 30 days (possible only if pre- mandate actions have been taken), scenario 5 should complete deployment in 90 days, with the military component being able to deploy in 30 days (possible only if pre-mandate actions have been undertaken), and finally, Scenario 6, implied that will be important the AU can deploy a robust military force in 14 days.Policy Framework for the Establishment of the African Standby Force and the Military Staff Committee, Chapter 1 para. 2.9 According to the Policy Framework, in a move towards standardized regional Standby Forces, they will be optimized for scenario 4. ASF Roadmap III demanded the six mission scenarios for PSOs to be revised and adapted to new paradigms of peacekeeping.African Union (2011): African Standby Force Roadmap III 2011-2015 Training exercises According to EASF, completing a first cycle of exercise, the Force reached its Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in late 2009. Parts of this cycle were a Command Post Exercise (CPX) in Nairobi, Kenya in 2008, and a Field Training Exercise (FTX) in Djibouti in November 2009.http://www.africom.mil/Newsroom/Article/7039/eastern-african-forces-work- together-in-historical (03/03/2014) In the second cycle, EASF first conducted a Logistics Mapping Exercise (LogMAPEX) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in November 2010,http://www.easfcom.org/index.php/events/ftx-13/2-mashariki-salam-2013 (03/03/2014) followed by a second CPX in Khartoum, Sudan in November 2011http://www.ipstc.org/media/documents/Newsletter_Quarter_04_Oct_To_Dec_2011.pdf (03/03/2014) and a second FTX in Jinja, Uganda in May 2013.http://mod.gov.rw/news- detail/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=1281&cHash;=55fa14ab0e7cb9160115ae2091a15e36#.UxRJRYVUNLM (03/03/2014) The latter involved 1,290 participants (military, police, civilian) and was intended to test EASF's deployment and mission implementation capability. EASF further conducted a CPX in Ethiopia in December 2014, after which its Full Operational Capability was declared. A third FTX took place in November 2017 in Port Sudan, Republic of The Sudan for 1,029 participants drawn from the 10 Member States. Deployment From 2012 to 2013, EASF deployed fourteen officers in a one-year mission as part of a technical team that supported the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) during the establishment.http://www.vovklict.nl/intercom/2011/2/27.pdf (03/03/2014) References Further reading *Alusala, Nelson. \\"African Standby Force: East Africa Moves On.\\" African Security Studies 13, no. 2 (2004): 113-121. *Robinson, Colin. \\"The Eastern Africa Standby Force: History and Prospects.\\" International Peacekeeping ahead-of-print (2014): 1-17.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on September 22, 2011. The episode was written by series creator Jonathan Nolan and directed by David Semel. Reviews for the episode were largely positive. In the United States, the series premiere achieved a viewership of 13.33 million. Plot John Reese (Jim Caviezel), a former CIA agent and Army Special Forces soldier- turned homeless alcoholic, has a struggle with a group of hot-headed teenagers on the subway. After this, he is extracted from police custody before Homicide Detective Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson) can confront him on his links to previous killings discovered through analysis of his fingerprints on the police system. Reese is brought to a mysterious and somewhat secretive billionaire, Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), who is the creator of the next- generation software known simply as \\"The Machine\\". After 9/11, Finch developed a computer program that can sift through enormous amounts of data, looking for patterns of behavior or activity that would predict another attack. It also provided information about individuals who could be in danger; it can predict the identity of a person involved in a premeditated crime that will happen at some point in the future ‚Äì however, Finch's back-door link to the Machine only provides the Social Security number of the person, and offers no clues to their involvement or when the crime will take place. Finch, who feels a need to do something to help these people, enlists Reese to aid him in preventing these crimes. Finch offers Reese a job to do this, as well as give Reese a purpose following the death of his girlfriend, Jessica (Susan Misner) (which is the source of his depression). The first on his list is Diane Hansen (Natalie Zea), an Assistant District Attorney currently working on a major prosecution of a prominent drug killing. Reese agrees to help and begins by watching her. Reese soon learns that Hansen is not the victim, but the perpetrator running a ring of corrupt police officers and planning to kill a fellow DA, Wheeler (Brian d'Arcy James). After blackmailing one of the corrupt officers, Detective Lionel Fusco (Kevin Chapman), into being his source of information inside the NYPD, Reese reveals Hansen's corruption to an open court, kills Detective Stills (James Hanlon), the leader of the corrupt gang of cops, and links Fusco to the crime to ensure his future cooperation. Having previously rejected Finch's offer of work, Reese recants and agrees to continue preventing violent crimes. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Pilot\\" was seen by an estimated 13.33 million household viewers and gained a 3.1 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. =Critical reception= David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \\"Person of Interest separates itself from the gimmick pack, not only because of superbly nuanced characterization and writing but also because of how it engages a post-9/11 sense of paranoia in its viewers.\\" David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the pilot four stars out of five, commenting on Caviezel's and Emerson's performances, saying Caviezel \\"brings the right stuff to this role\\" and Emerson \\"is fascinating as Mr. Finch.\\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times stated that in regards to the pilot, \\"the notion of preventing crimes rather than solving them is an appealing twist...

Etymology  Mahidevran's name (, ) means \\"one who is always beautiful\\", \\"one whose beauty never fades\\" or \\"beauty of the times\\" in Persian. Another meaning of her name is \\"Moon of Fortune.\\" Some sources name her G√ºlbahar (, ), with g√ºl meaning 'rose' and bahar meaning 'spring' in Turkish and Persian.  Title and status  Mahidevran was the mother of ≈ûehzade Mustafa, the eldest surviving son of the reigning Sultan, who was first in line to ascend to the imperial throne. She held a prominent position in the harem of her son in Manisa. While H√ºrrem Sultan became Suleiman's favorite and later his legal wife, Mahidevran Sultan retained the status of the mother of Suleiman's eldest son, and was referred to as Suleiman's \\"first wife\\" by some diplomats, despite the fact that they were never married. Until Hurrem Sultan, upon becoming the Sultan's legal, wedded wife, was given the title of \\"Sultan\\", all consorts had the title of 'Hatun', meaning lady. As such, Mahidevran was not a sultana, and did not hold the rank of Sultan.  Origins and early life  Little is known of Mahidevran's early life. Her ethnic background is a matter of controversy. She was either an Albanian or Circassian. Theories of her origins are: *According to some contemporary Venetian sources, she was of Circassian origin.Dr Galina I Yermolenko, Roxolana in European Literature, History and Culture, pg.2, citing Navagero (\\"la circassa\\"), Trevisano (\\"una donna circassa\\") in Eugenio Alberi, ed.

The Turkish translation by Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli, p.291, translates it by \\"Euboean\\". in accordance with some (unidentified) accounts, in which she was of \\"Montenegrin origin\\", ie from Montenegro.  Life with Suleiman  She was listed among the seventeen women of the harem of Suleiman while he was governor of Manisa; she was not a highly ranked consort, as she earned 4 aspers a day along with two other concubines, while three others earned 5 aspers. Mahidevran gave birth to her only child, Mustafa who was born in 1515 while they were in Manisa where Suleiman was the sanjak ruler. When Selim I died in 1520, Suleiman moved to Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, along with his family to ascend the throne. In 1521, Suleiman lost his two other sons, nine-year-old Mahmud and the toddler Murad, Mustafa became the eldest of his princely generation. This gave Mahidevran an elevated position, but early in Suleiman's reign, Mahidevran encountered a new rival, H√ºrrem, who soon became Suleiman's favourite and later his Haseki and legal wife. It was recorded by Bernardo Navagero that Suleiman highly cherished Mahidevran in the Topkapi Harem along with H√ºrrem. But by 1526, he had stopped paying attention to Mahidevran and devoted his full affection to H√ºrrem. H√ºrrem gave birth to her first son Mehmed in 1521 and then Selim (future Sultan Selim II) in 1524, destroying Mahidevran's status of being the mother of the Sultan's only son. The rivalry between the two women was partially suppressed by Hafsa Sultan, Suleiman's mother.Sel√ßuk Aksin Somel: Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire, Oxford, 2003, , p. 123 According to Navagero's report, as a result of the bitter rivalry a fight between the two women broke out, with Mahidevran beating H√ºrrem, which angered Suleiman. According to Necdet Sakaoƒülu, a Turkish historian, these accusations were not truthful. Mahidevran left Istanbul with her son Mustafa due to his appointment as governor of Manisa province and upon his death in 1553 she went into refuge in Bursa, where she eventually died. Conversely, H√ºrrem stayed in the palace while her sons were sent for to govern provinces as Sanjak-bey. Foreign observers of the Ottomans, especially the ambassadors of the Venetian Republic followed Ottoman dynastic politics closely; their comments about Mahidevran glimpses of the vital role played by a prince's mother and of her necessary devotion to this welfare. Pietro Bragadin, ambassador in the early years of Suleiman's reign, reported that while both were still resident in the imperial palace in Istanbul, Mustafa was his mother's \\"whole joy\\".  Mustafa's provincial posts  According to Turkish tradition, all princes were expected to work as provincial governors (Sanjak-bey) as a part of their training. Mustafa was sent to Manisa in 1533, in the formal ceremony and Mahidevran accompanied him. Describing his court at Kara Amid (Diyarbakƒ±r) near the Safavid border, Bassano wrote around 1540 that the prince had \\"a most wonderful and glorious court, no less than that of his father\\" and that \\"his mother, who was with him, instructs him in how to make himself loved by the people.\\" At some point Mustafa returned to Manisa, and in 1542 he moved to Amasya. By 1546 three more of Suleiman's sons were in the field, and the competition for the succession began among the four princes, although the sultan would live for another twenty years. The ambassador Bernado Navagero, in a 1553 report, described Mahidevran's efforts to protect her son: \\"Mustafa has with him his mother, who exercises great diligence to guard him from poisoning and reminds him everyday that he has nothing else but this to avoid, and it is said that he has boundless respect and reverence for her.\\" Mustafa was an immensely popular prince. When he was only nine, that Venetian ambassador had reported that \\"he has extraordinary talent, he will be warrior, is much loved by the Janissaries, and performs great feats.\\" In 1553, when Mustafa was thirty eight years old, Navagero wrote, \\"It is impossible to describe how much he is loved and desired by all as successor to the throne.\\" The rumours and speculations said that, towards the end of Suleiman's long reign, the rivalry between his sons became evident and furthermore, both H√ºrrem and the grand vizier R√ºstem Pasha turned him against Mustafa and Mustafa was accused of causing unrest. However there is no evidence of such a conspiracy. During the campaign against Safavid Persia in 1553, Suleiman ordered the execution of MustafaLord Kinross: The Ottoman Centuries, (Trans. by Nilifer Ep√ßeli) Altƒ±n Kitaplar, ƒ∞stanbul, 2008, p. 233. on charges of planning to dethrone his father; his guilt for the treason of which he was accused has since been neither proven nor disproven. As per Ottoman tradition, Mahidevran was at the head of Mustafa's princely harem. Up until the very end of her son's life, she endeavored to protect Mustafa from his political rivals, and most probably maintained a network of informants in order to do so. The ambassador Trevisano related in 1554 that on the day Mustafa was executed, Mahidevran had sent a messenger warning him of his father's plans to kill him. Mustafa unfortunately ignored the message; according to Trevisano, he had consistently refused to heed the warnings of his friends and even his mother. Later years and death The entrance of Mustafa's t√ºrbe at Muradiye Complex, where she is buried For several years after her son's execution, Mahidevran lived a troubled life. She went to Bursa, where her son Mustafa was buried and became the last concubine to retire to Bursa. Less fortunate than her predecessors and presumably disgraced by her son's execution, she was unable to pay the rent on the house in which she lived, and her servants were taunted and cheated in the local markets. Mahidevran's situation improved towards the end of Suleiman's reign when her debts were paid at the sultan's order and a house was purchased for her, possibly by Suleiman's sole surviving son, Mustafa's half brother Selim. Financially secure at last, Mahidevran had enough income to create an endowment for the upkeep of her son's tomb. Her rehabilitation has been possible only after the death of her rival H√ºrrem in 1558. Mahidevran died in 1581 outliving Suleiman and all of his children and was buried in Mustafa's tomb. Depictions in literature and popular culture In the 2003 TV miniseries, H√ºrrem Sultan, Mahidevran was played by Turkish actress Hatice Aslan. In the 2011‚Äì2014 TV series Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l, Mahidevran is portrayed by Turkish actress Nur Fettahoƒülu.

At the end of the station operating history, it was composed of a base chateau, four ski lifts, three T-bars and a magic carpet, five pistes, two green (runs 40, 60), a blue (run 80), a black diamond (run 100), and a glade double black diamond (run 120 or \\"Bois joli\\"). It had a vertical and the longest run was . At one time, it was the cheapest lift ticket in the Laurentians. Ski Mont Alta Ski Mont Alta (), founded in 1951, was a ski station located on Highway 117 in Val-David. It closed permanently after its ski lift controller was burnt up, when the chalet burned down in 2014. It now operates as an off-piste park, allowing winter hiking, ski-hiking, etc. in winter, without lift services. Baumgarten‚Äôs Ski Hill Baumgarten‚Äôs Ski Hill, located on Baumgarten Hill, in Ste-Agathe, is reputed to have the first rope tow in existence, though that distinction is disputed with Foster's Folly at the Big Hill in Shawbridge (Prevost). The ski hill was opened by local businessman Mo√Øse Paquette in 1928, and was continued to be run by his family after his death. The hill itself is named after businessman Alfred Baumgarten, who built a cottage at the base of the hill, by the lake, in the mid-19th century. Ski Mont Castor Ski Mont Castor located on Mont Castor, in Ste-Agathe, was a ski hill that operated from 1962 to 1995. It once operated 2 T-bar ski lifts. At the base of the ski hill is now located Maximise (), an all-season ski/snowboard slopestyle training facility, with rails and big air, water landing ponds, trampolines, and airbag landings; and includes a winter snowpark, with rope-tow ski lift. Le Chantecler Le Chantecler () was an alpine ski hill on the south side of Mont Chantecler in Sainte-Ad√®le, on the north side is the still open Ski Chantecler. The resort hotel portion of the ski station is still open, as are the tubing, cross-country trails, and horse-drawn sleigh routes. Chalet Cochand Chalet Cochand is reputed to have been the first ski resort in North America. √âmile Cochand's ski school opened in 1911, followed by the inn in 1914; in Ste-Marguerite. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKcsU0dGcfY Gray Rocks Gray Rocks () =Greater Montreal area= Alpine skiing on a former piste on Mount Royal, circa 1904 The Greater Montreal Area lies at the confluence of the Ottawa River and Saint-Lawrence River.

By the 19th century, critics recognized that the maps were replete with historical inaccuracies.Goffart 2003, pp. 110, 205‚Äì208. Description The four-volume Trait√© de la police by Nicolas de La Mare (1639‚Äì1723),This spelling is based on the Nicolas de La Mare identity page at BnF.

The eight maps were included in the first volume, published in 1705, to accompany a discussion of the historical basis of the plans.

Goffart, p. 208, identifies him only as A. Coquart without dates of birth and death. likely designed and engraved the first seven maps, using information and materials provided by La Mare, while Nicolas de Fer was the engraver of the eighth, which was based on a contemporary city map. The maps proved popular and were frequently reproduced and sold. Goffart believes that about 1715, de Fer copied the entire set of eight and published them by his own name, and is therefore sometimes credited as the sole author. By the 19th century critics recognized the many errors in the maps and sometimes described them as \\"fanciful\\" and \\"imaginary\\".

The chief god of Armenia was Aramazd, called the Architect of the Universe, Creator of Heaven and Earth. Spandaramet was his wife, some myths say. He was the father of the other gods, and had several daughters, among which Anahit (who according to other myths was the wife of Aramazd), the most famous goddess of Armenia, which corresponded to the Greek goddess Artemis, and was the mother of Astghik, the goddess of beauty and the personification of the moon, corresponding to the Phoenician goddess Astarte, and the third Nane (n…ën…õ) or Noone, goddess of war. Spandaramet was the guardian spirit of the land and the vines, the latter meaning, the Christian writers of the fifth century Armenians used to translate this name Dionysius. By associating Spandaramet with the Abyss, this word was used as a synonym for Hades, an idea that already appeared in other mythologies of Zoroastrianism. Plus, Spand (’ç’∫’°’∂’§) means slaughter in Armenian. Sources, oppositely to the information above, also indicate that: > Spandaramet was an Armenian earth goddess whose name comes from the Iranian > spenta aemaita, the seven bounteous immortals of the Zoroastrian tradition. > She represented both fertility (the fruit of the vine), and the resting > place of the dead. She typified the fertility of the ground. Spandaramet was > invisible, but her visible symbol was the earth itself. She thus corresponds > to the Greek Demeter or Mother Earth. Because She was also seen as the > goddess of the dead, with the coming of Christianity, the word Spandaramet > took on the meaning of hell.

With its origins in the early 19th century, the company was founded in 1862 as the Rugby Lias Lime & Cement Company Ltd before being renamed the Rugby Portland Cement Company Ltd in 1872, in 1979 it was renamed the Rugby Group plc. In 2000 Rugby Cement was taken over by the RMC Group, which was itself taken over by the Mexican firm Cemex in 2005. Cement production still continues at the New Bilton site in Rugby under Cemex ownership. History The business was first started in 1825 as a small family business by two local businessmen Thomas Walker and his son George Walker when they started producing lime mortar at a site on their land at New Bilton and nearby Newbold-on-Avon, exploiting locally available deposits of what Professor H.B. Woodward described in 1898 as \\"the finest inland section of lower lias limestone in the country\\". The first public company the Rugby Lias Lime & Cement Company Ltd was founded in 1862. In around 1870 the company began producing portland cement, and the company was renamed the Rugby Portland Cement Company Ltd. in 1872. The next milestone in the company's history occurred in 1933 when Sir Halford Reddish became the managing director of the company. The company began to expand its activities, acquiring four plants at nearby Southam in 1934, Rochester in 1937, Gillingham in 1939, and Stockton in 1945. The first two were rebuilt and modernised with the latest technology, but the latter two were soon closed down as they competed with the Southam and Rochester plants. In 1955, the company founded an Australian subsidiary, Cockburn Cement Ltd, in Perth, Australia, which was later merged in 1999 into Adelaide Brighton Cement. In 1965 a 92km pipeline was opened to transport chalk as slurry from Kensworth Chalk Pit, Bedfordshire to the Rugby plant. By the 1980s the company branched out from its Portland cement base to offer a wider variety of cement types, including sulfate- resistant cements, cements for the offshore oil industry, and quick-drying cements. In 1984 the company bought the Addison Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia, thus entering the American construction market, and also saw it enter the joinery market. The cement works at Rugby In the late 1990s, the plant at Rugby was upgraded at a cost of ¬£200 million to a production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes. At the same time the plants at Southam and Rochester were closed down as production was concentrated at Rugby.

The car did not have a Warrant of Fitness that lasted more than the 5 months that regulation 53 of the Transport Regulations 1956 legally requires, with a penalty upon conviction, of a fine. Facer subsequently used this breach of the law to not pay for the car, claiming the contract was illegal. and thus not legally enforceable. The car dealer ultimately sued Facer to obtain payment. Held The court ruled that the Regulations' purpose was road safety, and not consumer protection as Facer had argued. That being the case, the judge noted that the interests of road safety could be served by fines rather than go as far as making the purchases illegal, and ruled that Facer was liable to pay for the car.

He also proposed some naval inventions. Life The youngest son of George Neilson, a calenderer, he was born in Glasgow on 24 September 1795. Educated at Glasgow High School and Glasgow University, he received a business training at offices in the city, and then joined his father in exporting cambric and cotton goods to America. In 1820, on returning from a visit to the United States, he married his cousin, Elizabeth Robertson. From 1822 to 1828 Neilson was in America on business. His wife died about the time of his return to Scotland. In 1841 he settled in Kirkintilloch, Dumbartonshire, where an unmarried sister managed for him and his family of three daughters and one son. In his latter years Neilson suffered from heart disease, and he died at Kirkintilloch on 3 May 1861, and was interred in the burying-ground of Glasgow Cathedral. Works On his return to Scotland, Neilson published Six Years' Residence in America, 1828. It includes his visits to New York City in the 1822 outbreak of yellow fever, and to Harlem, and details, now considered exaggerated, of the Lavinia Fisher murders in Charleston, where he claimed to have been in 1820. He visited also Philadelphia, and New Orleans where he attended religious services. Neilson wrote poetry, and The Millennium and Scripture Gems were published in 1834. His collected Poems, edited with memoir by Dr. William Whitelaw, appeared in 1870. Neilson edited, or wrote, The Life and Adventures of Zamba, an African King; and his Experiences of Slavery in South Carolina (1846). Ostensibly this was a slave narrative by Zamba Zembola only edited by Neilson. He also contributed to the Glasgow Herald a series of articles on Cotton Supply for Britain. Inventor In 1846 Neilson proposed improvements on the life-buoy to the Admiralty. On 8 January 1848 he wrote to Lord John Russell, suggesting iron-plated ships, and 1855 he corresponded further on the subject with Lord Panmure and Admiral Earl Hardwicke. After the building of HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince, Neilson summed up his views in Remarks on Iron-built Ships of War and Iron-plated Ships of War, 1861. Shortly afterwards he published another pamphlet, on the defence of unfortified cities such as London.

It was the most powerful winter storm of the 2013‚Äì14 North American winter storm season, being an unusually large winter storm as well, with its gale-force wind field becoming four times larger than that of Hurricane Sandy's extratropical remnant. The storm affected various parts of the Midwest, most of the Eastern Seaboard (especially New England), as well as eastern Canada, bringing extremely powerful winds (reaching hurricane-force in some areas), and blizzard-like conditions. Meteorological history On March 24, an extratropical disturbance developed in the Gulf of Mexico, just off the coast of South Texas. Within a day, the developing storm crossed over Florida, before emerging off the east coast of the Southeastern United States on March 25. Late on March 25, the winter storm emerged off the coast of the Southeastern United States and began to undergo explosive intensification, becoming a bomb cyclone by March 26, and absorbing another weaker winter storm to the west in the process. However, the storm's path remained off-shore, which resulted in relatively minor impacts to most of the Northeastern United States. Despite the storm's distance from the coast, the system caused wind damage and blizzard-like conditions across New England and eastern Canada. Powered by moisture coming from the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the opposing air masses, the storm quickly became a superstorm with a gale-force wind field four times larger than that of Superstorm Sandy, during the extratropical duration of the latter system, which was extremely unusual for a storm at that time of the year. Later on March 26, the massive nor'easter reached a peak intensity of , shortly before it made landfall on Nova Scotia. The storm also had peak sustained winds of , and maximum gusts up to , while unofficial records measured wind gusts up to . Early on March 27, the superstorm made landfall on Nova Scotia and weakened to a strong nor'easter. The storm continued to move towards the north, while gradually beginning to weaken. Later on the same day, the nor'easter weakened to a storm and moved northward into the Labrador Sea. On March 28, the storm stalled in the middle of the Labrador Sea. Early on March 29, the nor'easter weakened further to a disorganized extratropical storm, even resumed a slow eastward track. Later on the same day, the northern part of the system reached Disko Bay, even as it continued to deteriorate. Early on the next day, the storm's center of circulation collapsed as the system became elongated, due to its interaction with a ridge of high pressure over Greenland, even while the system's center of circulation remained off the east coast of Greenland and stalled, weakening to a low. Several hours later, the storm's remnants were absorbed into a frontal zone.http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20140330.gif Impacts Aside from the impacts in eastern Canada, the Northeastern United States was battered with areas of snow and hurricane-force winds, with winds gusting up to in Chatham, Massachusetts.http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXDailyHistory.asp?ID=KMANORTH33&day;=26&year;=2014&month;=3 =Snowfall totals= North Carolina *Highest snowfall total reported was 12.2 inches near Bleech Mountain.

There are laws in place to prevent corruption, but the enforcement is very weak. Low prosecution rates of corrupt officials is another contributing factor to the rampant corruption in Uzbekistan. It is not a criminal offense for a non-public official to influence the discretion of a public official. The judicial system faces severe functional deficits due to limited resources and corruption. In Uzbekistan, corruption is present at virtually every level of society, business, and government. It is also one of the world's most corrupt countries, and among the contributory factors is its possessing the second largest economy in Central Asia, its large reserves of natural gas, and its geographical position between the rival powers of the so-called Cold War II. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 157th place out of 180 countries. ‚ÄúGraft and bribery among low and mid-level officials are part of everyday life and are sometimes even transparent,‚Äù states Freedom House, which adds that the ubiquity of corruption helps to ‚Äúlimit equality of opportunity.‚Äù A 2015 report by Amnesty International quotes a businessman who was arrested and tortured in 2011, as saying that corruption in Uzbekistan is a ‚Äúcancer that had spread everywhere.‚Äù Corruption in government Bribery, nepotism, and extortion are common throughout the Uzbek public sector. =Presidential power= President Islam Karimov Uzbek artist Vyacheslav Okhunov told Der Spiegel in 2015 that the late Islam Karimov, then Uzbekistan's president, was \\"a dictator\\" who exhibits Mafioso tendencies. Karimov has been accused of ruling Uzbekistan with an iron fist for a quarter-century, shaping a culture that \\"has a greater resemblance to North Korea than China.\\" Critics have sardonically noted that there is almost no televised news broadcast that does not feature Karimov \\"cutting a ribbon for some new facility somewhere\\". According to the Heritage Foundation, Karimov's absolute power extended to judicial appointments. Freedom House has reported that Karimov exercised total power over the legislature, which acts as a \\"rubber stamp\\" that approved Karimov's decisions. The group states that Karimov's virtually absolute power allowed him to exploit every sphere of activity in his country for personal economic benefit. Even after his death in office, Karimov's influence has remained firm enough to allow his handpicked successor, Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev, to be acting President pending the Presidential by-election in blatant disregard to the Constitution, which places that responsibility at the hands of the President of the Senate. =Gulnara Karimova telecom corruption scandal= The president's daughter, Gulnara Karimova, has (like the president himself) been associated with large- scale corruption. A Swiss criminal investigation begun in 2012 was directed at first against four Uzbek citizens who had connections to Karimova. Two of them were arrested that year and released on bail. Also in 2012, a Swedish television documentary stated that a Swedish telecommunications company, TeliaSonera AB, had paid $320 million to Takilant (a Gibraltar-based shell company reportedly linked to Karimova) in exchange for licenses and frequencies in Uzbekistan. In January 2013, Swedish investigators released new documents apparently showing that TeliaSonera had tried to negotiate directly with Karimova. In the same year, U.S. and Dutch authorities began investigating Karimova. In February 2014, the chief executive of TeliaSonera was forced to resign after serious failures of due diligence were uncovered. In May, the Swedish media made documents public that suggested Karimova had aggressively dictated the terms of the TeliaSonera contract and threatened it with obstructions. Related money-laundering investigations in Switzerland and Sweden continued throughout the year, and hundreds of millions of dollars in accounts connected to the case being frozen by authorities. Gulnara Karimova In March 2014, Swiss authorities began a money-laundering investigation into Karimova, and prosecutors in Bern said that the evidence had led their investigation into Sweden and France and that they had \\"seized assets in excess of 800 million Swiss francs ($912 million).\\" According to Swiss newspaper Le Temps, of the seized funds 500 million francs of the seized funds involved TeliaSonera and the remained \\"involved Karimova's personal assets.\\" In 2014, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated TeliaSonera as well as the Amsterdam- based Vimpelcom Ltd. and the Russian firm Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS) on suspicion that these three firms had funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to firms controlled by Karimova. An August 2015 report stated that U.S. prosecutors were asking authorities in Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Switzerland to seize assets of about $1 billion in connection with their investigation. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported in January 2015 that executives at the Norwegian telecom firm Telenor, which owns one-third of Vimpelcom, had knowledge about millions in bribes. In March 2015, DOJ asked Sweden to freeze $30 million in funds held by the Stockholm-based Nordea Bank. The DOJ probe discovered that firms had \\"paid bribes to Uzbek officials to obtain mobile telecommunications business in Uzbekistan.\\" European investigators revealed that Takilant was run by a former Karimova aide. A July 2015 report stated that U.S. authorities were seeking to seize $300 million in bank accounts in Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium, alleging that the funds were bribes paid to Karimova. In August 2015, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that Uzbek authorities had arrested nine suspects in connection with probes, including two top executives at a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Uzbekistan, which Karimova formerly owned. =Corruption in elections= \\"There are no free elections in Uzbekistan,\\" according to Freedom House. In the April 2015 election, Karimov received 90.39% of the vote, winning a fourth term, although the constitution restricts presidents to two terms. Election observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were critical of the conduct of the election, and Steve Swerdlow of Human Rights Watch called it a ‚Äúsham.‚Äù =Judiciary= Corruption is widespread in Uzbekistan's judiciary. The judiciary system is officially independent, but corruption is rampant, and the law actually allows certain kinds of government interference and ‚Äúequivocation.‚Äù Public officials, lawyers, and judges often ‚Äúinterpret local legislation inconsistently and in conflict with each other.‚Äù Corruption is a standard feature of legal proceedings, mainly in conflicts between firms. Judges are said to take bribes and kickbacks from individuals and companies in exchange for favorable verdicts. The judiciary is under the control of the executive, is riddled with nepotism, favoritism, and kickbacks, and is characterized by ‚Äúunreliable and non-transparent‚Äù appeals processes. ‚ÄúBribery, abuse of office and vague interpretation of laws‚Äù result in unfair decisions. In commercial cases, courts reportedly favor local companies over foreign firms. Courts are also alleged to address corruption charges against high-level officials only on presidential orders. Although the judicial system is required to uphold ‚Äúinvestor rights and the sanctity of contracts,‚Äù in practice it is said to regularly favor \\"state-owned or government-affiliated entities.‚Äù Court procedures in Uzbekistan, states the Heritage Foundation, \\"fall short of international standards, and powerful figures can expropriate property with impunity\\". In addition, private property can be confiscated by the government for no reason, with no system for registering liens on chattel in place. =Criminal justice system= According to Amnesty International, corruption is ingrained in Uzbekistan's justice system. Torture (in the form of \\"beatings, asphyxiation, rape and sexual assault\\") is a widely used by law enforcement and the authorities. Torture is used to \\"extract confessions, to intimidate entire families or to extract bribes.\\" Family members are tortured to extract confessions and \\"on the basis of these confessions, [torture survivors] have been sentenced to long terms in prison after unfair trials.\\" The Uzbekistani National Security Service has been reported to have engaged in torture. =Police= Corruption within the Uzbek police force has been described as \\"pervasive.\\" Extortion is common, and police regularly use false charges to dissuade anyone from reporting their corruption crimes to higher bureaus. A 2014 report stated that police corruption had risen recently owing to the currency exchange market coming under the control of known criminal groups. =Public services= Corruption is common in the public-services sector. Civil servants are low-paid and thus included to solicit and extort bribes, according to the Business Anti-Corruption Portal. Officials extort payments from companies in connection with the granting of permits and licenses, and ‚Äúuse arbitrary inspections and punitive sanctions to harass companies, to interfere with their business operations and to reduce market competition.‚Äù =Land administration= Judicial corruption prevents the protection or enforcement of property rights. The Business Anti-Corruption Portal reports that the state routinely expropriates private property, providing opportunities for extortion and corruption. =Forced labor= While over 2-3 million Uzbeks (mostly university students as a full-time workers for over 3 months, teachers, professors, doctors as a part-time for over 3 months) ‚Äúwere forced to work on cotton fields‚Äù during the 2014 harvest, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), officials were alleged to have embezzled substantial funds from the operation. ‚ÄúImpossibly high quotas were reportedly set, with workers forced to pay fines to make up the deficits.‚Äù The Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights called the quotas an 'unprecedented degree of extortion', as workers were made to continue their labor in exchange for food and housing. =Tax administration= Corruption is said to be common in the Uzbek tax administration. The vague and ambiguous tax laws allow for official corruption, often in the form of bribery and extortion at the expense of foreign companies. Firms involved in judicial disputes are subject to the seizure of assets by tax officials, according to the Business Anti-Corruption Portal. =Customs administration= Uzbekistan's customs sector is riddled with corruption. Customs officials and border guards are reported to take bribes from smugglers, as a result of which the amount of smuggling increases annually. ;Tashkent customs arrests Several senior officials of the Tashkent Province State Customs Committee were arrested on bribery charges in October 2014. They were accused of extorting bribes, participating in organized crime, and eliciting favors in exchange for employment at the customs offices. The fees for clearing goods across borders are arbitrary, and foreign firms say that customs restrictions are ‚Äúamong the most severe challenges to doing business in Uzbekistan.‚Äù =Public procurement= Corruption is ubiquitous in the public procurement sector, which is characterized by widespread conflicts of interest, a lack of transparency, and bribes being extorted in exchange for government contracts. There is a reported lack of transparency during the bidding for contracts from the government. Foreign investment According to anti-corruption groups, most of the foreign firms that are awarded profitable contracts have ties to Uzbekistan's ruling elite. Foreign firms, explains one source, \\"regularly experience expropriations, politically motivated inspections and discrimination by authorities\\" in Uzbekistan. According to the U.S. Department of State, foreign firms ‚Äúhave reported numerous procedural infractions in both the Economic and Criminal courts of Uzbekistan and the Embassy knows of a number of cases in which foreign companies did not receive timely payments from local partners.\\" In the World Bank's 2013 Doing Business Report, Uzbekistan stood at 149th out of 189 countries on the \\"Ease of Doing Business\\" scale. U.S. firms say that corruption is the prime obstruction to foreign direct investment in Uzbekistan. These firms cite a \\"lack of transparency in bureaucratic processes, including procurement tenders and auctions, and limited access to currency convertibility, stimulate rent seeking, which public sector employees often justify by pointing out their low wages.\\" To secure professional appointments, win government contracts, obtain exemptions from rules, escape criminal prosecution, receive public services, and earn preferences, bribery is a necessity, according to the U.S. Department of State. Many incidents of bribe solicitation have been reported to the U.S. Embassy, and \\"foreign investors who refuse to pay bribes have had difficulty in their business operations as a direct result.\\" Time magazine reports that tenders and government jobs are easily attained through bribery, causing unqualified people to rise up in positions. The State Department cites several complaints from investors who state the bidding process lacks transparency. \\"In some cases, the bidders have been foreign-registered companies associated with influential Uzbek families who have tenuous foreign addresses.\\" Also, the Uzbek state can cancel any business's registration or license or impose punitive sanctions at will. Ministries have the power to decide whether companies under their jurisdiction require licenses. The Economic Court can shutter businesses, which have the right of appeal, although the process is slow, unpredictable, and non-transparent. More profitable foreign firms are at a greater risk of expropriation, although smaller and less profitable firms are still at risk. Expropriations have occurred in several industries including food processing, mining, retail, and telecommunications. For eighteen months beginning in October 2011, the government prevented the production and distribution operations at a brewery owned by the Danish Carlsberg Group. In the same year, the government initiated the liquidation of the Amantaytau Goldfields, a joint venture involving a British firm, Oxus Gold. In September 2012, the Tashkent City Criminal Court found Uzdunrobita, a cellular-phone firm wholly owned by the Russian company MTS, guilty of financial crimes, and seized its assets. Two months later an appeals court reversed this verdict, but upheld the $600 million of fines imposed on the firm. MTS left the market, writing off all of its assets in Uzbekistan, which amounted to $1.1 billion. In 2013, the government transferred these assets to a government-owned telecom firm. In 2013, government authorities began a criminal investigation into Muzimpex Company, the local partner of the Coca- Cola Company, which held a 43 percent stake in Muzimpex. In February 2014, the government liquidated Muzimpex and took it over. Civil society The Uzbek Constitution's guarantee of press freedom is effectively non-existent in practice, with almost all media operating under government control. Journalists who criticize the regime are reported to have been subject to \\"physical violence, prosecution, detention and fines,\\" often on charges of defamation. Journalists who investigate corruption are supposedly compelled to self-censor to avoid trouble. Local civil-service organizations are prohibited from monitoring or reporting on corruption. Anti-corruption The nation's criminal code forbids \\"all major forms of corruption\\" but the Business Anti- Corruption Portal reports that this law is poorly enforced. High-ranking government officials are said to act with impunity. The presidential family itself is involved in several investigations internationally. Persons who report corruption are reportedly not protected from retaliation. Uzbekistan is a signatory of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and the Istanbul Action Plan, but not the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The government has been accused of neglecting any regional or local initiatives to combat seriously combat corruption. To date no international or local organizations have been granted permission to monitor or analyze corruption in Uzbekistan besides the General Prosecutor's Office, which is under the control of the Uzbek ruling regime. A number of officials are prosecuted every year under anti-corruption laws, with punishment varying \\"from a fine to imprisonment with confiscation of property.\\" The defendants tend to be political dissenters, rather than any of the corrupt officials with ties to the ruling elite. International tolerance of Uzbek corruption Owing largely to its strategic location and its natural gas supplies, many countries have been loath to pressure Uzbekistan to improve its corruption record. For example, despite his nation's high levels of corruption and human-rights violations, Karimov received a warm welcome from the President of the European Commission. Germany has been described as ignoring much of the Uzbek regime's corruption and violations, defying EU sanctions imposed in 2005 after the Andijan massacre in which anywhere from 200 to 1,500 people were killed, training Uzbek officers, and making annual payments to the Uzbek government in exchange for access to a military facility in Termiz. Der Spiegel suggested that the German government may foresee its relations with Uzbekistan as a means of profiting from planned natural gas pipelines under consideration of construction.

Background Hastie hired Carey to do some building alterations at his Wellesley Street business premises, and was later invoiced ‚Ç§274 for the work. However, local council bylaws required that a building permit be first issued by the council before building commenced, although for small jobs, the council practice was to allow the building permit to be issued after building had started. At the start of the contract, the owner was required to obtain the necessary building permits, but as the owner was causing delays to the build over approval of the final plans, in an effort to speed up the build, the builder agreed to take responsibility to get the permits. Carey subsequently completed the alterations, but for unknown reasons, he did not get the necessary building permits for the work, although the council had approved the building plan, and the work being inspected by a council building inspector. Not satisfied with receiving illegal unpermitted alterations, Carey paid ¬£139 of the account, and refused to pay the balance, claim the contract was illegal and not legally enforceable. The builder subsequently sued successfully in the District Court for the balance of ¬£135, but was reversed on appeal in the High Court. And the matter made its way through the courts despite the claim's ridiculously low amount, until it finally reached the Court of Appeal. Held The court held that by not getting the necessary building consent, breached the council bylaws, making the contract illegal by performance.

Chemically, it is the naturally occurring octasulfur (S8). Forms and uses Pulverised sulfur * Flower of sulfur or sublimed sulfur (Latin: sulfur sublimatum) is the naturally occurring, unpurified form. It comes in yellow flakes and has been used in traditional and alternative medicine for humans and animals, as well as in alchemy and sulfuring fruit before drying. * Purified sulfur (sulfur depuratum) is prepared by washing sublimed sulfur with ammonia. It is a fine yellow powder. It was formerly used as a laxative, but this application is rare today. * Precipitated sulfur (sulfur praecipitatum) is prepared by boiling sulfur and calcium oxide in water and then precipitating with hydrochloric acid. It, too, is a fine yellow powder. * Colloidal sulfur (sulfur colloidale) is an extremely fine sulfur powder prepared by repeated precipitation, first from polysulfides with protein and then from a slightly alkaline solution with ethanol or acetone. It has a greyish-white colour. Colloidal solutions in water are milky, and bluish when viewed against the light. =Topical uses= Precipitated sulfur and colloidal sulfur are used, in form of lotions, creams, powders, soaps, and bath additives, for the treatment of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, and seborrhoeic dermatitis. Other topical uses included the treatment of superficial mycoses (infections with fungi) and scabies, but this is largely obsolete now. Adverse effects Common adverse effects include irritation of the skin at the application site, such as dryness, stinging, itching and peeling. Generalised allergic reactions are rare; they include hives as well as swelling of lips, tongue, and throat, potentially closing up the respiratory tract. Overdose Ingesting more than a few grams can lead to poisoning by hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which the gut flora produces from sulfur. H2S is also generated on the skin, but topical formulations do not induce toxic concentrations except when large quantities are used for small children. Mechanism of action Sulfur is converted to hydrogen sulfide through reduction, partly by bacteria. H2S kills bacteria (possibly including Propionibacterium acnes which plays a role in acne), fungi, and parasites such as scabies mites. In the gut, H2S increases motility, acting as a laxative. Sulfur's keratolytic action is also mediated by H2S; in this case, the hydrogen sulfide is produced by direct interaction with the target keratinocytes themselves.

Juma-Jami Mosque, Yevpatoria Roman Catholic church in Yevpatoria The majority of the Crimean population adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, with the Crimean Tatars forming a Sunni Muslim minority, besides smaller Roman Catholic, Ukrainian Greek Catholic, Armenian Apostolic and Jewish minorities. The Crimean peninsula was Christianised at an early time, via Gothic Christianity, in the 4th century. According to a 9th-century tradition, Pope Clement I (ruled 88‚Äì98) was exiled to Chersonesos (near what is now Sevastopol) in 102, as was Pope Martin I in 655. A representative from the Black Sea area, the \\"head of the Scythian bishopric\\", was present at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, as well as the First Council of Constantinople in 381; it has been surmised that this representative would have to have been Bishop Cadmus of the Bosporan Kingdom. Ostrogoths, who remained on present-day Ukrainian lands after the invasion of the Huns, established a metropolinate under the Bishop of Constantinople at Dorus in northern Crimea around the year 400. The Goths initially adhered to Arianism, but by the 9th century, with the establishment of the Byzantine Cherson theme, the Goths in Crimea turned to the Greek Orthodox Church, under the Metropolitanate of Gothia. A bishop's seat had also existed since 868 across the Strait of Kerch, in the city of Tmutarakan. In the mid-10th century, the eastern area of Crimea was conquered by Prince Sviatoslav I of Kiev and became part of the Kievan Rus' principality of Tmutarakan. In 988, Prince Vladimir I of Kiev also captured Chersonesos where he later converted to Christianity. Meanwhile, the Khazars, who occupied the northern parts of the peninsula, converted to Judaism. Both the date of the conversion, and the extent of its influence beyond the elite, are disputed; the conversion must have taken place at some point between AD 740 and 920. Islam in Crimea begins with the presence of Islamized Turco-Mongol populations following the Mongol invasion of Rus' in the 1230s. Islam becomes the state religion of the Golden Horde in 1313 with the conversion of √ñz Beg Khan (Crimea's first mosque was built in Qƒ±rƒ±m in 1314).Williams, BG. The Crimean Tatars: The Diaspora Experience and the Forging of a Nation. Pg 12. With the annexation by Russia in 1779, Crimea was again Christianised, this time under the Russian Orthodox Church, but most Crimean Tatars remain Muslim to the current day (except those that have been deported by Stalin in 1944, nearly half of them died in the process). In 2013 Orthodox Christians made up 58% of the Crimean population, followed by Muslims (15%) and Believers in God without religion (10%). Since the Russian annexation of the peninsula in 2014, the United Nations human rights agency, the OHCHR, has catalogued human rights violations by the occupation authorities, including against freedom of thought, conscience, and religion of people in Crimea and Sevastopol.

Volunteers can join TUI by sending a mail to The Ugly Indian or by registering one's name and email address on TUI's official Facebook page.  Spot-fixing  TUI calls cleaning the street \\"spot-fixing\\". TUI chooses small segments of road each week to clean: pavements piled up with plastic, defaced walls, footpaths rendered unusable by potholes as spot-fixing places. All tools, materials and instructions are provided on the spot. All spot-fixes are self-funded and volunteers are requested to make a contribution towards material costs.  Guidelines for volunteers  300px The Ugly Indian's philosophy is \\"Kaam chalu mooh bandh. Stop Talking, Start Working.\\" Apart from this, TUI has general guidelines regarding spot-fixing. * No lectures, no moralising, no activism, no self-righteous anger. * No confrontation, no arguments, no debates, no pamphlets, no advocacy. * Don‚Äôt step on anyone‚Äôs toes, don‚Äôt take sides in any ideological debates. * Support existing systems and improve their effectiveness for the greater good. * Basically, get real. Treat everyone with sincerity, respect and dignity first, and the greater good will be an outcome.\\"  Solution  TUI recognises the spot-fix as a success only if: * It lasts for at least 90 days. * It requires no ongoing supervision. * It is low-cost (ideally free) and easy to implement and replicate * It changes the behaviour and attitudes of all concerned * It creates minimal disruption in the daily actions of everyone concerned (nobody should lose a job, lose a source of income, or get seriously inconvenienced ‚Äì because it takes only one Ugly Indian to undo the good work of a hundred others.  Anonymity  Anonymity is a big attraction of the movement. The Ugly Indian describes itself as a \\"faceless, leaderless\\" volunteer organization. It is made up of self-driven and motivated people who are mostly professionals in the 25‚Äì40 age group. They remain strictly anonymous. The Ugly Indians have chosen to remain anonymous as the names and identities of specific individuals are not important and they respond to media queries only by email. The founder of the group generated controversy for the derogative group name, which was probably a reference to himself.  Projects  = Project Under the Flyover (UFO) = Under The Flyover Map Project UFO was started by TUI in Bangalore, India to clean and reclaim spaces under flyovers. This project is citizen led and has transformed 30 flyovers since 2015. The UFO project has already spread to New Delhi, Pune and Chennai where new groups have taken up the responsibility of cleaning and beautifying these unmaintained spaces. Progression of Project UFO Project UFO was created in order to combat unwanted posters, open urination, garbage dumping and illegal parking in spaces underneath flyovers. There is an observation called ‚ÄòThe Broken Window theory‚Äô which states that if there is a broken window on a street, windows on that same street are more likely to be broken. This effect can be caused by vandals who assume that since one window is broken, it is acceptable for more windows to be broken. It may also be caused by everyday people who see a broken window and think that they do not have a responsibility to repair their own window. Activities such as garbage dumping and graffiti spread in the same way that broken windows spread. The basis of Project UFO is to reclaim public spaces under flyovers by cleaning and beautifying them, thus reducing the chance that people will continue to dump waste and place unwanted posters in these areas. 400px The first attempt at reclaiming a flyover was attempted by anonymous citizens in early 2015 and was completed at Richmond Circle flyover, Bangalore. According to one of the volunteers who was interviewed by ‚ÄòThe Hindu‚Äô, the first attempt at rejuvenating the area under Richmond Circle flyover was a failure. The Ugly Indian refined their designs and tactics to dissuade people from defacing the pillars of the flyover and applied their new design pattern on Jayadeva Flyover in October 2015. In essence, these new designs were to act as poster repellent. Seizing upon their initial success, they replicated the work across 25 flyovers and exhibited the work done under Hebbal Flyover on 10 January 2016. Although initially the funding was purely from citizens, emboldened by the success stories of Project UFO, private companies started taking active part by donating corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to the cause. Political officials such as ex-Mayor K. S. Satyanarayana have participated in similar events and spot fixes under the flag of TUI. Methodology The primary method that the UFO project utilizes to reclaim public spaces is to attempt ‚Äòspot fixes‚Äô. The design and paint color depicted in the finished pillar below are intended to prevent people from continuing to deface the flyover pillars, place posters and dump trash. Volunteers are recruited from companies donating CSR funds and from the general public via social media. To date nearly 4000 volunteers have spent their time working with TUI on their UFO project and have helped to reclaim over 30 flyovers. The cycle of fixing public spaces can be broken into four major sections. =#1 Erasing Signs of Neglect= 200px 200px The cause of neglect in public spaces can center around the fact that many of these spaces do not have a purpose. Areas under flyovers have typically been left unchanged in Bangalore after construction activities and with no purpose these UFO areas tend to fall into misuse. Removal of waste, posters and other discarded articles are done by volunteers to erase signs of neglect so that the space can be transformed into a space for the community.The dry waste from the flyovers is removed and sent to landfills in designated areas but the wet waste is redirected and is sent to processing plants across the city. =#2 Designing Spaces of Respect= Volunteers are provided with aprons and gloves and work to clean the area and paint the pillars with new, vibrant colors as a way to deter further misuse of the space. The design is uniform to ensure that posters are not placed in dead spaces; the uniform design is also not distracting to drivers. The iconic triangular design on a red, terracotta background was selected after several different designs were tried. The red background was selected to brighten the area at night and cover any staining that was present on the pillars before they were painted. The triangular pattern itself was intended to be easy to paint by novices while being visually engaging enough to drown out any posters that would be placed at eye level.All of the colors were chosen so that they would be secular and non-partisan to ensure that the message of beautification does not have any political meaning. =#3 Act of Reclaiming Public Spaces= Cleaning and beautifying spaces under flyovers is the first step, but the most important act is to create an area that people are adverse to dumping garbage in and misusing. By giving the space a function, like installing benches or plants, it prevents people from disposing of garbage in that area. Under the Domlur flyover, a skating rink has been created as a way to engage the community and to ensure that the space remains clean and well used. 200px The primary purpose of the beautification and cleaning is to reclaim a public space by using visual cues to dissuade people from littering or dumping.This has caused a drop in the number of posters placed by 95% at flyovers that have been reclaimed under the UFO project. =#4 Continuing Maintenance of Areas= One of the keystones to creating a space that is part of the community is to ensure that it is well maintained. This creates a culture around the area to ensure that the space stays clean and well used. Companies such as Embassy group under their CSR program have donated funds for TUI to create a maintenance team that works to keep the areas that they have worked on clean after the initial project. Critics of Project UFO Project UFO has not been without objections to its mission. One of the most vocal opponents of the project is Assa Doron who stated that Project UFO and other movements like it, \\"[are] a form of aesthetic purification that addresses the dirt seen and smelt, but which has little regard for the wider structures of inequality underpinning public hygiene and waste-picking practices, let alone the question of waste generation, which is the product of capitalist consumption and production.\\" He goes on to say that TUI is forcing the ideals of the middle class on society as a whole and are attempting to white wash a problem that has deeper, systemic roots. Given that Project UFO is based on a ‚Äòspot-fix‚Äô methodology, where volunteers come in, clean the space, then leave, Doron laments that this method leaves no way for critics to voice their concerns and ultimately leads to a ‚Äòstrong man‚Äô mentality where only the voice of TUI is heard. People who frequent the areas around the flyovers have some concerns as well; especially those that are the most impacted by the changes to the UFO areas. They believe that the project to reclaim spaces under flyovers has an important mission, but that the areas that have been ‚Äòspot-fixed‚Äô will not remain that way. These groups believe that spaces that were once dirty and misused will simply return to their previous state after several months. Self-audit of the Project UFO The Ugly Indian conducted a comprehensive survey on their UFO Project which audited nearly 2200 pillars (metro & flyover) on 17 April 2019. The survey was conducted on this date because it was the day prior to Lok Sabha Elections (General Elections) in Bangalore; elections typically produce a slew of new posters hung on every vertical surface which would allow TUI to see if their poster deterrent designs for flyover pillars were effective.Out of the 950 flyover pillars, only 4% were found defaced or marked with posters. Government Response Emulating Project UFO BBMP has launched its own \\"Adopt-a-Flyover‚Äô‚Äô initiative as part of the Clean Bangalore Campaign in 2018. Companies have the ability to adopt, maintain and beautify flyovers in and around Bangalore through this initiative. The first adopted flyover was Veeranapalya on the Outer Ring Road which was funded by L&T; Technologies and designed by TUI. BBMP hopes that this will be the first of many adoptions in Bangalore which will help to keep the city clean and well maintained. Project UFO brought due attention to the abuse of public property and defacement of pillars.  Products  = tereBin = TereBins are dustbins provided by TUI for public use. TereBins weigh around and are meant for paper cups, banana skins, cigarette packets and similar small litter. TUI provides tereBin service ‚Äì which involves identifying ideal locations, installing the bins, setting up a daily clearing system and integrating with the local garbage clearance system and daily supervision. Terebins can be \\"adopted\\" (for a fee of INR 2,000). = WonderLOO = The wonderloo is an open urinal that protects the privacy of the users. The loo is unmanned and free to use. As of 2014, some 10 urinals are in operation. TUI, in association with the local BBMP office, ensures that each wonderloo is cleaned twice a day.  Credit and advertising  According to TUI, they have declined multiple offers from companies wanting to sponsor tereBins and WonderLOOs in return for advertising. However, TUI accepts adoption requests, especially from companies, if they do so without advertising on the specific object.

Frustrated by the constant ‚Äì and often losing ‚Äì battle for funding at the health clinic she operated in her rural hometown, Pania soon sets her sights on getting a job as a GP at Shortland Street. She aims to build it up in a similar vein, both to benefit the local community and put her name up in lights. Because for Pania, it's also an exercise in empire building, as what she has will never be enough for her. She is very protective of TK and began to fall in love with him to the point of obsession. Pania decided that she wanted to divorce Caleb to get closer to TK. She made Lucy stay away from TK after they had a fling. After Caleb noticed Pania's obsession with TK, she took advantage of his drug issue and spread lies about him. Pania made TK believe that Caleb was in desperate need of help. Caleb became jealous of her professional and personal involvement with TK and started to call her out in front of TK. Despite TK not believing him, Pania still thought of Caleb as an obstacle in her attempt at winning him over. She attempted to drug Caleb many times. After ending up in hospital due to an overdose at the hands of his wife, Pania tried to murder Caleb by giving him a lethal dose of propofol. Caleb woke up and fought back, leaving scratches on Pania's arm... but he was too weak and was killed. TK's girlfriend and Pania's enemy Kylie, got suspicious of Pania and decided to try to find out how Caleb was really killed and bring Pania to justice. Pania stalked, nearly ran over and drugged Kylie over several weeks before she finally hijacked her car with Tillie Potts inside. Pania drove out of town, refusing to answer TK's desperate phone calls after he realised that she is responsible for Caleb's death after-all. TK eventually finds Pania lurking over a cliff with Tillie by her side. He declares his love for her, in a desperate attempt to save his daughter but Pania reassures TK that she would never hurt Tillie and she gives herself up to the police. TK told Kylie days after the incident that Pania tried to contact him, but he never wants to see her again.

Stratos (; 1905 ‚Äì 30 August 1981) was a distinguished Greek lawyer, politician and historian. The son of politician and Prime Minister of Greece Nikolaos Stratos, he was elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament continuously from 1932 to 1961, he served five times in cabinet posts as Minister for Labour (1946, 1954‚Äì55), Minister Governor-General of Northern Greece (1952‚Äì54) and Minister of Health and Social Welfare (1958‚Äì61, 1961‚Äì62). At the same time, he was actively interested in the study of the Byzantine Empire, and following his retirement from politics dedicated himself to writing the six-volume Byzantium in the 7th Century (Œ§Œø ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒπŒøŒΩ œÉœÑŒøŒΩ Œñ' Œ±ŒπœéŒΩŒ±, 1965‚Äì77), the first comprehensive study of the Byzantine state during this critical period in its history.  Life  Andreas Stratos was born in Athens in 1905, the son of Nikolaos Stratos and Maria Koromila. In November 1922, his father was tried and executed by the military government as one of those principally responsible for the Greek defeat against Turkey in the so- called \\"Asia Minor Disaster\\". In the virulent political atmosphere of the time, 17-year-old Andreas fled with his mother and sister, Dora, to Germany. The family was in dire financial situation, despite some help from his grandmother and Nikolaos Kalogeropoulos, forcing his mother to seek employment as a soprano singer as well as a dressmaker in various fashion designers. Andreas was able to study in law and political sciences at the universities of Jena, Berlin, and Paris, where he also studied music in a conservatory. In 1927, the family returned to Greece, and Andreas received his degree in law from the University of Athens. After finishing his military service, he became a lawyer, as well as securing an appointment in the legal department of the National Bank of Greece. The popularity of his father in his home province of Aetolia-Acarnania allowed him to stand for Parliament and win the seat for Aetolia-Acarnania in the 1932 elections with the People's Party, a feat he would repeat for ten consecutive elections until 1961. Upon the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War in October 1940, he enlisted as a volunteer. He was re- elected with the People's Party in the first post-war elections in 1946, and became Minister for Labour in the interim cabinet of Panagiotis Poulitsas and the cabinets of Panagis Tsaldaris (13 April ‚Äì 21 November 1946). Among his initiatives during this tenure were the foundation of the unemployment fund, wage increases for night-shifts, holidays and Sundays, and the establishment of summer camps for children of low-income working families. In 1947, Stratos and further 18 MPs split off from the People's Party and Spyros Markezinis' New Party. In the 1950 elections, however, the New Party performed disastrously, and only Stratos was re-elected to Parliament. In 1951 he joined the Greek Rally of Marshal Alexander Papagos, being re-elected in the 1951 and 1952 elections. Stratos became Minister General-Governor of Northern Greece in the Papagos cabinet until 15 December 1954, when he was appointed Minister for Labour a second time, until the resignation of the Papagos cabinet on 6 October 1955, following the Marshal's death. Despite suffering a heart attack which necessitated treatment in Paris, Stratos was again elected in absentia as MP for Aetolia-Acarnania in the February 1956 elections, now with the Greek Rally's successor, the National Radical Union. He then served as head of the Greek delegation to the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Re-elected in 1958, he became Minister for Social Welfare throughout Konstantinos Karamanlis' third cabinet (17 May 1958 ‚Äì 20 September 1961), and again after the 1961 elections from 4 November 1961 until his resignation on 20 December 1962. After his resignation, Stratos retired from politics and devoted himself to his passion, the study of the Byzantine Empire. Although not a trained scholar, he was an avid enthusiast and participated in many international conferences on Byzantine studies and published many articles in international scholarly journals. Already in the early 1950s he had focused his interest on the 7th century, a transformative but until then neglected period in Byzantine history. The fruit of his research would be the six-volume Byzantium in the 7th Century (Œ§Œø ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒπŒøŒΩ œÉœÑŒøŒΩ Œñ' Œ±ŒπœéŒΩŒ±, Estia 1965‚Äì77), later translated into French and English, for which he received the Prize of the Academy of Athens in 1970. Andreas Stratos died on 30 August 1981. Two volumes with collections of articles were published in his honour in 1986 by his fellow Byzantinists.

History The 2005 NASA Authorization Act designated the US segment of ISS as a National Lab in order to ‚Äú‚Ä¶help improve life on Earth, foster relationships among NASA, other Federal agencies, and the private sector, and advance STEM education through utilization of unique ISS Capabilities in microgravity.‚Äù In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, Congress directed NASA to select an entity to manage the US National Laboratory. In August 2011, NASA entered into a 10-year agreement with CASIS in order to maximize the use of the ISS US segment as a National Laboratory. Since CASIS began managing the National Lab in 2011, the organization has selected more than 200 ISS projects, ranging from stem cell research, drug development, materials testing and new consumer products, to monitoring atmospheric conditions from space, 3D printing, and surgical robot testing. Of the 270 payloads that CASIS has sent to the ISS, 176 have been for commercial companies including Merck, Novartis, Eli Lilly and Company, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, and Procter & Gamble. In July 2017, NASA extended the contract with CASIS to manage the US National Lab through September 2024. Missions and Operations  The mission of CASIS is ‚Äúto advance the nation‚Äôs leadership in commercial space, pursue groundbreaking science not possible on Earth, and leverage the space station to inspire the next generation.‚Äù CASIS endeavors to provide: * seed money to fund research projects and product development * aerospace expertise to assist researchers in utilizing in-space laboratory assets * access to space via several launch providers * administrative support \\"to cut through red tape to facilitate quick access to space\\" * educational outreach projects and curricula to teach and inspire students across the country through its STEM Program. CASIS currently contributes to a space-based economy, serving the academic and industrial research communities by providing access to the ISS. The National Lab has conducted business in space for the past six years. During that time, it has built intellectual capital and a network of researchers that utilize existing resources on the ISS or partner with the National Lab to develop new research platforms in space. In addition, the National Lab supports approximately three-dozen privately owned technology companies that provide services to researchers on the ISS. This web of researchers and technology companies work together with the staff at the National Lab to convert terrestrial research into experiments that can be performed in low earth orbit, and to develop and validate new technologies for use on the ISS. This model has served the research community well and the National Lab fully utilizes its 50% allocation of ISS resources. Over the past five years, the National Lab has used $75M of NASA funding to generate an additional $150M of non-NASA, non-National Lab funds to support research. In FY2018 alone, two new research platforms, four patents and 17 research articles have been enabled by the National Lab. There are 14 research platforms on the ISS that have been implemented. The National Lab is the only NASA-funded, non-NASA asset that has sufficient experience to immediately up-scale its level of activity to positively impact an economy-in- space model. The problem with this type of commercialization is that it is limited in its ability to generate revenue and still requires a great deal of NASA-subsidized access to the ISS. In addition, the research performed in this manner is typically discontinuous and generally of low impact. The National Lab is using its existing capabilities to enable the next phase of commercialization in space.  Research  See also: International Space Station United States National Laboratory Research Section The US National Lab conducts research in life sciences, physical sciences, technology development and remote sensing for a wide variety of academic, government and commercial users. Researchers choose to conduct experiments in space because of the unique effects that microgravity, or weightlessness, has on physical and biological phenomena. Not only does microgravity give researchers greater sensitivity in measurements of phenomena and characteristics in many fields, but the National Lab also offers the unique ability to observe its long-term effects on a wide variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Another benefit of experimenting in space is the exposure of materials to its extreme conditions, including the large amounts of radiation and hot and cold temperature cycling. The knowledge of how these conditions influence materials allows researchers to manufacture long-life reliable components used on Earth. The National Lab also has unique remote sensing capabilities. The orbital path of the ISS travels over the regions of Earth that contain more than 90 percent of the Earth's population, giving scientists a unique view of our planet. In addition to the view, the ISS also provides better spatial resolution and variable lighting conditions as compared to the orbits of typical Earth observation satellites, which pass over the same area at the same time every day.  Education Initiatives  CASIS was chosen by NASA to both manage the National Lab and develop education programs that will motivate students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) industries. To encourage STEM education and interest, the National Lab supports hands-on, problem-based learning opportunities that transition the ISS research into real-world settings for K-12 students. The National Lab also funds student internships and teacher fellowships, and supports teacher professional development training in STEM-related areas. In 2016, CASIS developed a program called Space Station Explorers, a community of educators and organizations that provide programs, activities and lesson plans for students who are interested in the ISS. The Space Station Explorers program includes opportunities for students to launch their own projects into space. Some of the Space Station Explorer experiments have allowed students to observe genetic changes in astronauts‚Äô DNA, learn how bacteria grows differently in space, and track the development of tadpoles into four-legged frogs.

Voting took place in all 543 parliamentary constituencies of India to elect members of parliament in the Lok Sabha. The result of this election was declared on 16 May. The 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014. Since the last general election in 2009, the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement by Anna Hazare, and other similar moves by Baba Ramdev, have gathered momentum and political interest. Issues such as Inflation, price rise and corruption were some of the chief issues. Social media There has been much commentary about the large role that social media is expected to play in this general election. The expenditure on social media by political parties has been estimated to be around Rs. 5 billion. In view of this, the Election Commission announced that they would be keeping tabs on the expenditure on social media by political parties and candidates. A group launched a non-partisan popular website called Let's Pray for India where people can adopt a constituency that they will pray for during the election.

He said the former's judgement disqualifying convicted lawmakers was not a law but \\"a judge-made law\\" and that the Election Commission's guidelines were effectively saying that \\"you should do or say nothing that wins you an election. You should try your best to lose elections.\\" He also criticised Modi for being ineffective during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Modi then criticised him for his discussion abroad: \\"This Indian National Congress should be renamed Institutions Neglecting Congress. They break and demean all constitutional institutions. It is their habit to misuse such institutions.\\" It follows the INC's nomination of candidates with corruption allegations. Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Viswas stirred up a controversy when it was revealed that five years ago he had referred to nurses from Kerala as dark skinned and indirectly implying that they were ugly. It triggered a chain of reactions from all over the country. Kejriwal then apologised for the incident. In one of the most controversial action, Narendra Modi, the PM candidate of NDA, showed the symbol of his party BJP and made a speech after casting his vote in Gandhinagar on 30 April 2014, violating the provisions of Sections 126 (1)(a) and 126 (l)(b) of R P Act 1951. ECI directed the Gujarat government to file complaints or FIR against him and others involved in the political meeting and asked the Gujarat Chief Secretary and DGP to send a compliance report by 6 pm on the same day. ECI even directed to file complaints against all the TV channels and other electronic media which carried the proceedings of the meeting and displayed the election matter and asked the Gujarat administration to file separate FIR against under Section 126 (l) (b) against those channels. Meanwhile, after the directions from ECI, two FIRs were registered on 30 April 2014 against Narendra Modi for violation of model code for elections by the Gujarat police. =Electoral= In Birbhum, Joy Banerjee, Bengali actor and BJP candidate from Birbhum was caught on camera distributing money to villagers violating model code of conduct. However Joy Banerjee and BJP president Rahul Sinha denied the charge. Joy Banerjee said he paid a villager for some things he bought. Inclusion of Pramod Muthalik head of Sri Ram Sene, who was involved in 2009 Mangalore pub attack, in BJP stirred a controversy. As Congress, CPIM and CPI latched on this issue and attack BJP, BJP took a U-turn and cancels Pramod Muthalik's membership. Later Arun Jaitley said that inclusion of Muthalik in BJP was a mistake. On 23 March, Sharad Pawar's comment regarding erasing the ink and voting twice made Election Commission of India issuing show cause notice asking him to explain his remarks. Later in his reply to ECI, he said that he regrets his infamous 'ink' remarks. The digital version release of AIADMK leader Jayalalitha starrer movie Aayirathil Oruvan during the campaign came in trouble following the issue of the model code of conduct by the ECI. It then ordered local authorities in Tamil Nadu's southern districts to remove film posters showing Jayalalitha and AIADMK founder M. G. Ramachandran. The election commission told the petroleum ministry not to change prices for natural gas products until the election was over. An increase in prices was due to take effect on 1 April; Kejriwal took credit for the application to defer the change. In March 2014, a video clip surfaced in which Masood was seen threatening Modi. On 29 March, he was arrested by police for his hate speech. On 8 April, Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan said that only Muslim soldiers are to be credited for the Kargil War victory which was termed communal and condemned by both the INC and BJP alike. Semi-nude poses by model Meghna Patel in support of Modi created a stir amongst the BJP. Similarly, Tanisha Singh stripped in support of Rahul Gandhi. Modi's campaign manager in Uttar Pradesh, Amit Shah, had been banned from electoral rallies and meetings in April for a speech that was deemed to have stirred tensions with minority Muslims in which he said voters should reject parties with Muslim candidates and that Muslims in Uttar Pradesh had raped, killed and humiliated Hindus. The ECI then rescinded the ban saying that Shah had lodged an appeal vowing not to use \\"abusive or derogatory language\\" and that the ECI would monitor his campaigning using video tracking.India's election commission lifts ban on top Modi aide ‚Äì In-Depth ‚Äì DAWN.COM The ECI banned Baba Ramdev from campaigning in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh after saying that people should not make \\"malicious\\" statements about the private lives of individuals and those who violated the directive would not be allowed to hold rallies during the election. In turn the police announced that they had charged Ramdev with making \\"false statements\\" after an analysis of video footage. The statement was that \\"[Rahul Gandhi] goes to Dalits' house for honeymoon and picnic. Had he married a Dalit girl, then his luck could have clicked and he would have become the prime minister.\\" Ramdev then said in regards to the controversy that the statement was \\"misrepresented. The term 'honeymoon period is over' is commonly used in political language.\\" However, the INC's Rashid Alvi claimed that Ramdev has \\"insulted the Dalit community...there are certain crimes which cannot be pardoned.\\" Dalit BJP leader Udit Raj, however, said of the statement that Ramdev had not said anything \\"wrong\\" against Dalits and that his intention was not \\"wrong.\\" The ECI later banned him from holding camps in Himachal Pradesh.

Telangana ON 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee unanimously passed a resolution for the creation of Telangana. It formally requested the INC-led UPA government to make steps in accordance with the Constitution of India for the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and the creation of Telangana. This was seen as an attempt by the INC to merge the Telangana Rashtra Samiti into itself for the general and provincial election after being marginalised in the Rayalseema and coastal regions by the YSR Congress. All-India Congress Committee general secretary for Andhra Pradesh Digvijay Singh said that TRS leader K. Chandrashekhar Rao had \\"repeatedly said that once Telangana was announced, he would merge his party with the Congress. We will await his decision and will be favourably inclined to accept the offer of a merger.\\" TRS welcomed the decision, with Rao saying that his party was fine with Hyderabad being the joint capital for 10 years; Ongole was then suggested as the new capital of Andhra Pradesh. YSR Congress party leader Jaganmohan Reddy said that he opposed the decision and would agitate against it, as all its MLAs resigned over the issue. However, former party member Konda Surekha attacked the party and its leader saying that he had backtracked on plenary party meeting supporting the issue. Andhra Pradesh BJP president G. Kishan Reddy gave credit for the move to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in saying that the INC took active interest in the issue after Modi had announced a tour to Hyderabad for 11 August. The BJP national spokesperson Prakash Javadekar suggested that the INC move was under pressure and \\"that's why we will watch carefully and see whether the intention again to backstab or to really give Telangana, and will watch till Telangana is formed.\\" He added that the BJP supports the creation of \\"Telangana and Vidarbha's demand. [The] announcement is the victory of the people of Telangana. BJP has always been in favour of Telangana. Congress promised it in 2004 but dilly-dallied for nine years. It has been a story of the struggle of the people of Telangana and nine years of betrayal by the Congress. The NDA's agenda in 1999 promised creation of three states, and it was honoured. The Congress, in contrast, made a promise in 2004 but betrayed people for nine years.\\" BJP national President Rajnath Singh re- iterated support and added, in regards to requests for the creation of Gorkhaland and Bodoland, \\"We were in favour of the Second States Reorganisation Commission earlier too. We now demand that the government should set it up and seek a report within a specific timeframe. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha also reacted in announcing an indefinite strike in calling for Gorkhaland. Meanwhile, the national Home Ministry said that due to the lack of development in the proposed areas and the proximity to other hotbeds in Chhattisgarh's Bastar and Maharashtra's Gadchiroli regions it could turn into a hotbed for the activities of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) if the administration is not quickly consolidated. In February, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Kiran Kumar Reddy resigned over the proposal to partition the region and launched a Samaikyandhra political party.

A member of the Democratic Party, Turner was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1989 until 2016. He attended the University of Houston and Harvard Law School. Turner ran for mayor of Houston in 1991, losing in the runoff election to Bob Lanier. He lost again in 2003, coming in third and thus missing the runoff. Turner won the 2015 election, defeating Bill King in the runoff by 4,082 votes out of 212,696 votes cast in the closest mayoral election in Houston history by percentage. On December 14, 2019, Turner won his second term as mayor over the more conservative Tony Buzbee, 56-44 percent in a turn out of less than 20 percent of registered voters. Early life Turner was born on September 27, 1954, in Houston, Texas, as the sixth of nine children, and was raised in the Acres Homes community in northwest Houston by his father, a commercial painter, and his mother, a maid at the Rice Hotel. He was senior class president and valedictorian at Klein High School. At the University of Houston he was Speaker of the Student Senate and graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. degree in political science. Turner was a finalist in the Ames Moot Court Competition while obtaining a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Law practice Upon completing law school Turner joined the law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski. In 1983, he founded his own firm, Barnes & Turner. He has served as an adjunct professor at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law, and as a seminar lecturer at the South Texas College of Law and the University of Houston Law School's Continuing Legal Education Programs. Turner was admitted to practice in the State of Texas, federal District Court for the Southern District Court of Texas and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He is a member of the State Bar of Texas, American Bar Association, National Bar Association, Houston Lawyers Association, and the Houston Bar Association. Turner served as an immigration lawyer for many years in Houston. Political career In 1984, Turner ran for Harris County Commissioner, Precinct 1 in the Democratic primary, but lost to El Franco Lee. Four years later, he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in House District 139 in Harris County and remained in office through 2014. During that time, Turner ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Houston in 1991 and 2003. During his 1991 campaign for Houston mayor, Wayne Dolcefino of Channel 13 ran an investigative report questioning Turner's involvement in an elaborate insurance fraud scam. The resulting scandal ultimately cost Turner the election. Turner sued Dolcefino and KTRK and was initially awarded a $5.5 million libel settlement that was reduced to $3.25 million by the presiding judge. KTRK appealed the ruling. The Texas Supreme Court overturned the money award on the basis of heightened legal protections which the First Amendment affords to the media. But the court found that both of these specific broadcasts were both false and defamatory. Turner with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in January 2017. Turner served more than 25 years in the Texas House of Representatives, and over the course of his service, he served as a member of the Legislative Budget Board, Vice-Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman of the Subcommittee of Articles 1, 4 & 5 (General Government, Judiciary, Public Safety & Criminal Justice) and the House State Affairs Committee. He also chaired the Texas Legislative Black Caucus and the Greater Houston Area Legislative Delegation. Turner has supported policies to attract doctors to underserved areas, proposed a measure increasing state funding for mental health services in Harris County from $32 million to $200 million, and worked to increase funds for legal aid for poor Texans. In February 2020, Turner endorsed Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. However, in March 2020, he switched his endorsement to former vice president Joe Biden. =Ride sharing mobile apps= In 2016, Turner voiced his support for laws regulating Uber and other ridesharing services to protect public safety. =LGBT rights= In 2015, Turner was named one of the top 10 best members of the Texas House on LGBT issues by Equality Texas with an \\"A+\\" rating, after Turner said he had \\"evolved\\" on LGBT issues. Turner, while running against Bill King in the 2015 Houston mayoral runoff election, stated he is \\"100 percent\\" committed to reenacting Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) and attacked Bill King for saying he won't revisit the issue of HERO, along with his support from the Campaign for Houston. =Consumer protections= New America in January 2019. In 1999, Turner voted to restructure the electric utility industry in Texas to allow customers competition and consumer choice. During his time in the legislature, he has also worked to continue to protect Texans, voting for bills preventing gas companies from cutting off service during freezing temperatures, limiting the amount utility companies could raise rates in order to fund certain projects, such as building electric poles and wires, without first getting approval from state regulators, and authoring legislation that required the Public Utility Commission to conduct cost-benefit analyses of any proposals from utility companies that would add more than $100 million to annual consumer electricity costs. During the 84th session, Turner authored legislation that would prohibit electricity companies from charging customers \\"minimum usage fees\\" when they used too little electricity. Turner also voted to allow the Public Utility Commission to issue emergency cease-and-desist orders, without first going to a court, to companies whose actions threaten the state's electricity supply. During the 83rd session, he joined a campaign to encourage low-income Texans to enroll in \\"LITE-UP Texas\\", a program \\"authorized by the Texas Legislature through which participants could reduce the monthly cost of electric service by 82%.\\" In the 84th session, he authored a bill to extend this discount program for another two years, until the end of 2017. He also co-authored a bill to help ensure persons living in multi-family residences are alerted when their electricity bill has not been paid. =Public education= In 2004, he voted against a measure that would have scaled \\"back benefits for future public school employees and discourag[ed] early retirement.\\" He was also critical of investment managers for the Teachers Retirement Fund for taking over $8.2 million in bonuses while the state was slashing funding for education and the system's investments continued to struggle. In 2011, Turner voted against a measure that would have implemented a 6 percent cut to education funding for all schools in Texas, a move that equated to a $4 billion education funding cut. As a member of the legislature, Turner voted against a measure that would allow school districts to lower their salaries, implement furlough days, and increase student-teacher classroom ratios. He also opposed a corporate tax break that many legislators, in the Texas House of Representatives, believed would hurt public school funding. =Immigration= Texas has banned sanctuary cities, but Mayor Turner said that Houston will not assist ICE agents with immigration raids. =Hurricane Harvey= In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Mayor Turner has received criticism for his decision not to suggest any form of evacuation. He has responded to the criticism by pointing out the logistics of evacuating \\"6.5 million\\" people and the deaths and traffic that occurred during the 2005 Hurricane Rita evacuation. Critics have replied stating that 6.5 million people did not have to be evacuated but instead tens of thousands could have been evacuated who were in flood zones or individuals who were most at risk during emergencies could have been evacuated.https://www.apnews.com/0af7c31e67ab439b9f23f892d013d418/Questions- swirl-around-Houston-mayor%27s-evacuation-decision =Health care= A supporter of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA), Turner voted against joining the Interstate Health Care Compact, an alternative to traditional ACA participation, and introduced legislation that would expand Medicaid in Texas pursuant to the ACA. Turner warned fellow legislators about the potential backlash from constituents if the state chose not to expand Medicaid, which promised a significant return on the state's investment. One of his major accomplishments in the House was legislation that expanded access to the children's health insurance program, which was passed in 2007. Turner also passed legislation in 2015 that will free up funding for medical trauma care centers, which have not received the full amount of funds designated to be spent specifically on trauma centers. The legislation will bring $25 million to the Greater Houston area over the next two years, including $11 million to Ben Taub and $10 million to the Memorial Hermann. During the 84th Legislature, Turner introduced legislation that would provide care under Medicaid for people with severe and persistent mental illness and who are transitioning from an institution to the community, and who are at risk of institutionalization or re-institutionalization. Abortion Sylvester Turner has long been an advocate for abortion. He voted against a measure requiring doctors to perform a sonogram on women seeking an abortion at least 24 hours before the procedures. He has also fought to protect funding for family planning programs and Planned Parenthood. Turner also voted against a Senate version of a measure that banned abortions after 20 weeks and tightened standards on abortion clinics, and also authored an amendment to the bill that would have required the state to pay the costs abortion clinics would incur on the measure to retrofit facilities so they could be certified as surgical centers. In 2013, the El Paso Times described Turner as a \\"lion of pro- abortion rights.\\" =Criminal justice= On gun control, Turner opposed measures to limit lawsuits against gun or ammunition manufacturers, allowing concealed handguns on higher education campuses, and rescinding the authority of local governments to ban concealed weapons on public property. He also opposed measures that would reduce the number of training hours required to receive a concealed handgun license. Turner supported a bill that prohibited the use of state funds for the enforcement of federal firearms regulations. He also advocated abandoning the \\"pick-a-pal system\\", where judges appoint commissioners who then can pick whoever they want to serve on grand juries. Personal life Turner is a member of the Brookhollow Baptist Church.https://www.texastribune.org/directory/bio/sylvester-turner/ He was married to Cheryl Turner from 1983 to 1991, and they have one daughter, Ashley Paige Turner.

It was later released on Facebook and Android, as well as the Korean social network platform KakaoTalk in November 2013.  Gameplay  Jelly Splash‚Äôs gameplay involves connecting lines of colored jellies to accrue as many points as the current level requires. There are five different colored jellies in total, namely yellow, red, blue, green and mauve. It is an expansion of games such as Dots, with a level-based progression similar to Candy Crush Saga. Jellies can be linked horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and special bonuses are rewarded for connecting longer lines. Instead of a time limit, there is a move limit for each level. There are a total of 200 levels available in the iOS version. At the start of each level players begin with a board of colored, anthropomorphic jellies which can be connected via a touchscreen or mouse interface to create strings of the same colored jellies. Many of the levels include obstacles in the form of slime or mushrooms that must be removed to complete the level. If players link seven or more jellies a superjelly is created, which can later be used to clear vertical or horizontal lines on the board. The creator of Jelly Splash, Florian Steinhoff, gave some insights into the gameplay and the mechanics of the game at the GDC 2014.http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Wooga+news/news.asp?c=58230title=GDC 2014: Wooga on using the FUUU factor to hit the top of the App Store The game's developers, also say that the game \\"...is actually little more sophisticated than a slot machine,\\" citing this aspect as being integral to the game's success  Monetization  Jelly Splash includes in-app purchases, which range from $1.99 to $99 via iTunes on the iOS platform. Players can buy coins, which can be converted into boosts, more moves or extra lives. Alternatively, lives are replenished over time, or can be requested from Facebook friends.  Popularity  Jelly Splash received over 1 million downloads on iOS platforms within a week of launch. The Korean version launched on KakaoTalk on 8 November 2013 and reached #11 on 13 November 2013. It reached the number 1 spot in the free charts in nine countries around the world, including the United States ‚Äì a first for Wooga and only the second German developer to achieve that. After eight weeks the game had 10 million downloads on iOS.  Reception  As of March 2014, Metacritic gives Jelly Splash a score of 63/100, indicating that it has mostly mixed or average reviews.

After joining the Paris Opera Ballet in 1997, she became a principal in 2012 and a star (danseuse √©toile) in December 2013. Shortly afterwards, she was described as having \\"la beaut√© du diable\\" (the beauty of the devil) as Lizzie in Fall River Legend. Early life Born in Paris, Renavand has a French father and a Vietnamese mother. Her decision to take up ballet resulted from her father's suggestion that she should make a list of what she would like to do with her spare time. As her first choice was dancing, she took lessons at the Conservatoire de Garches. In 1989, only a few months later, she was admitted to the Paris Opera Ballet School at the age of nine, receiving the support and friendship of Claude Bessy. Career After graduating from the Ballet School, Renavand joined the Paris Opera Ballet in 1997. Although she progressed well in the corps de ballet, she had a rough time for the first few years putting on too much weight. Thanks to the encouragement of Brigitte Lef√®vre, she was able to revitalize her approach, losing in a year. Further support came from Angelin Preljocaj in 2004 who allowed her to replace an injured colleague as Cre√ºse in his Le Songe de M√©d√©e, giving her more confidence in her abilities. She was then invited by Pina Bausch to dance Eurydice in her Orph√©e et Eurydice. In the following year, she was given roles in Maurice B√©jart's The Rite of Spring, William Forsythe's Approximate Sonata and The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude, Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n's Bella Figura and Rudolf Nureyev's Don Quixote in which she performed The Street Dancer. Renavand won the Association pour le rayonnement de l'Op√©ra national de Paris (AROP) prize in 2008. That year, she danced roles in The Rite of Spring, The House of Bernarda, In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, Kaguyahime, Ph√®dre, Les Enfants du paradis, The Three-Cornered Hat, Genus, La Bayad√®re, Cinderella, Le Jeune homme et la mort, Siddharta, and Psych√©. In 2012, she was promoted to principal (premi√®re danseuse), performing the roles of Kitri in Nureyev's Don Quixote and the Mistress of Lescaut in Kenneth MacMillan's L'histoire de Manon. In December 2013, she was elevated to the rank of star (danseuse √©toile) after dancing the main female role for the first time in Preljocaj's Le Parc.

Pryer, the founder of Sandakan. William Burgess Pryer (7 March 1843 in London, England; ‚Äì 7 January 1899 in Suez, Egypt) was the first British Resident in Sandakan of North Borneo. Pryer's character is described as adventurous, diligent, and goal-oriented. For example, he knew that before exploring his career in Shanghai, he had explored large parts of the Spanish East Indies (Philippines), and he was a former amateur boxing champion.British North Borneo Herald, 17 September 1928; Cited in JMBRAS, page 47.  Personal life  Pryer was born in London on 7 March 1843 as the son of Thomas and Isabel Pryer. He was the elder brother of H. Pryer (died in 1888), who is well known in connection with Japanese Lepidoptera and was a corresponding member of the Zoological Society since 1880. = Early career = In his earlier days, he was an enthusiastic collector of British Lepidoptera. In 1860, he went out to China in connection with the silk and tea house of his relatives Messrs. Thorne Bros., Shanghai, where he remained for twelve years, and devoted considerable attention to collecting the Lepidoptera, of which very little was then known. An account of an expedition he made to the wonderful Snowy Valley appeared in the 'Entomologist's Monthly Magazine,' vol. xiv. Among the results of his work in China was the discovery of many new species, which were described by Messrs. Butler, Moore, and others, and a few by himself in a paper in the 'Cistula Entomologiea,' vol. ii. The collection he formed there afterwards passed into the possession of Messrs, Salvin, Godman and the British Museum. In 1887, he wrote on the butterflies of Borneo with William Lucas Distant.Distant & Pryer, 1887 On the Rhopalocera of Northern Borneo. Part I & II Ann. Mag. nat. Hist. (5) 19 (109): 41-56, (112): 264‚Äì275 = North Borneo Chartered Company = He then began his professional career as an accountant at Thorne & Company, a British company in Shanghai. During his time in China where he met Baron von Overbeck and Alfred Dent, who negotiated with the rulers of the territories in northern Borneo a concession for their colonial interests. Overbeck and his business partners then sailed to England to raise funds for the planned company. After a short experience of business in London, he began to travel to North Borneo in 1877. After the treaty had been done with the help of William Clark Cowie, a European close friend of the Sultan of Sulu on 22 January 1878, Pryer was given the title Resident of the East Coast on 11 February 1878 as a sign of their claim to the new territory in northern Borneo at the old trading station of Cowie. The trading station is located on Timbang Island because of German settlers who is the predecessors of Sandakan, although located further southwest of today's port town. From his provisional \\"resident\\", Pryer began to explore the environment and the implementation of Overbeck's orders to build up friendly relations with the indigenous population, respecting the local customs, to include their chiefs in jurisprudence and to deal with matters of acquisition and sale of land concerned. In September 1878, Pryer administration was tested for the time as on 4 September; El Dorado, a Spanish cannon boat had entered the port. The boat captain, Lobe informed Pryer that he would raise the Spanish flag on the order. Pryer resist and convinced Suluk chief Nakoda Alee to position his warriors in front of the houses in full warfare. In view of the belligerent presence, the Spaniards renounced further hostilities and announced to return with reinforcement from Manila; a threat which has never been materialise. On 15 June 1879, the German settlement became a victim of flames and was burnt down completely, Pryer took the opportunity to move the settlement to the present place in Sandakan Bay. His decision proved to be a wise decision because the settlement that was founded on 21 July 1879 on the previously uninhabited jungles and mangrove forests grew faster than any other places in North Borneo. Pryer named the settlement as Elopura and became the founder of Sandakan. It was also Pryer, who proposed to make William Hood Treacher as the governor of North Borneo. Treacher had already been present at the negotiations with the Sultan of Sulu, and had appointed Pryer as a consular agent, before being left by Overbeck in the German settlement. While Treacher and Pryer united by the enthusiasm with which they pioneered their task, but with the arrival of other officials increasingly led to conflicts. On 10 December 1883, Pryer married Ada Blanche Locke and began to retire from the administration post. After his retirement, he purchased the Bai Island in Sandakan Bay, planting coconuts, coffee and betel nut palms and ran cattle. At Beatrice Estate, which is another plantation near Elopura, Pryer experimented with the cultivation of new products. He completely failed from the cultivation of tobacco starting in 1892, but rather predicted a decade before the natural rubber boom that the rubber tree was the ideal working plant for the indigenous coastal inhabitants. = Correspondence with Rizal = Pryer and his wife met with Jos√© Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, on their trip to Hong Kong sometime in 1892. Rizal shared his idea of a Filipino community in North Borneo for those who were dispossessed of their lands in Calamba by the Dominicans under the North Borneo Project. Pryer was receptive of the idea, and corresponded with Rizal to finalise the details of the lease. Rizal then request the permission of the Governor-General of the Philippines at the time, Eulogio Despujol for the proposed project and he also reportedly request for permission to change his nationality to be qualified to emigrate to North Borneo, although the request were rejected by the Governor-General.  Retirement and death  Pryer completely retired from working in 1892 after an agreement with the supervisory board of the North Borneo Chartered Company to acquired his estate about 20 kilometres north of Sandakan along with a further property at Kabeli, an inflow of Sandakan Bay where Pryer used to cultivate sugar cane, nutmeg, cocoa, cotton, gambier plant and rubber. At the same time, his health have been getting worsened; as he was increasingly suffering from severe and unexplained painful conditions. Following this, Pryer decided to return to England in 1898. Pryer died on the way to England between 7‚Äì8 January 1899 at Suez and was buried there on 11 January. He left his wife without any children.  Legacy  William Burgess Pryer Memorial in Sandakan.

It is commonly known in North America as mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda. All parts of Pieris floribunda are poisonous if ingested. It is a rare plant to find in landscapes because it is difficult to propagate and it often does not adapt well to cultivation. However, there are a few specialty and native plant nurseries that sell some, overcoming the more difficult propagation. In landscapes it should be grown in full to part shade, out of windy locations, and have a good quality soil with much organic matter with acidity of pH 4.5 to 6.5 The very similar Japanese andromeda, Pieris japonica, is very common in eastern landscapes of the United States and occasionally in midwestern ones. It is easy to propagate, easily adapts to cultivation, and differs most in having very pendulous flower clusters rather than erect ones as the American species. The mountain fetterbush is less subject to damage from the Azalea lacebug that often infests the Japanese species. There is a cultivar of a hybrid between the American and Japanese species called 'Brouwer's Beauty' that does adapt easily to cultivation and bears intermediate flower clusters that are erect and yet drooping also. Habit Pieris floribunda is a bushy shrub growing to around high with oval shiny, leathery leaves which are normally evergreen, but may shed in a harsh winter to brown and persist until spring. It has erect or erect with just slightly nodding panicles of white urn-shaped flowers that form in autumn as erect pink buds. The brown, dry fruit is a slightly angled globular capsule about long in autumn and persisting until late April. The gray-brown bark is shaggy and peeling when mature.Flora of North America, Pieris floribunda (Pursh) Bentham & Hooker f., 1876.

The work included a diversion dam on the Virgin River, the wide canal grade with an wide by deep channel, and a series of flumes and trestles. Work was done by local men, mainly between November and May. The work was paid for by the canal's shareholders, whose lands on the Hurricane Bench were to be irrigated by the canal. Allotments were limited to for shareholder. The of new agricultural lands allowed the settlement of Hurricane after 1906. An aqueduct along the Hurricane Canala, August, 1971 The work and the shareholder system were organized by James Jepson and John Steele. The superintendent of construction was J.T. Willis. Work was hampered by the failure of the first two diversion dams at the Narrows section of the Virgin River. The final dam was a timber crib and boulder structure, later augmented with concrete. From the dam the canal runs westerly along the wall of the Virgin River Canyon, then south for along the Hurricane Cliffs to the Hurricane Bench. It passes through twelve tunnels and six flumes. Wood flumes have been replaced with metal, and ten cisterns for drinking water have been abandoned. The Hurricane Canal was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 26, 1977.

Biography Born to a family of limited means, he apprenticed in Craveggia, his birthplace, with a painter, from about 1710 to 1716. He was then sent to Bologna, then Venice, where he was strongly influenced by the painters Giuseppe Maria Crespi and Giovanni Battista Piazzetta. By the age of 19 he had returned to Craveggia. By the age of 25 he had joined the studio of Andrea Dell'Angelo. Among Borgnis' pupils was Giuliano Da Parma and two of his sons, Giovanni (born 1728) and Pietro Maria (born 1743). He was known for painting local sacred subjects including Villette, Baceno, Vocogno, Trontano Crana, Smeglio, (Mozzio) Coimo, Viganella, Montecrestese, Varzo, Trasquera, Bugliaga, Cattagna, Domodossola, Schieranco, Vocogno, Cimalmotto, Trontano, Sempione, Campo Valmaggia, Cevio Valmaggia, Prestinone, and Druogno. From 1752 to 1755 he searched for work in Paris and London. Soon after, on 12 October, 1761, he died in London of causes unknown. It is thought that he perhaps died of a fall from a scaffold. His children traveled to England to complete some of his works. His masterpieces include frescoes and canvases (1723‚Äì1727) done for the parish church of Santa Maria Maggiore. He also painted for the Oratory of Gabbio in Malesco and the Oratory of the Madonna del Sasso di Orasso. He painted in the parish church of Campo di Valle Maggia (1748).

He was intolerant of liberalism and a strong supporter of the church. Early years Jacques Joseph Guillaume Fran√ßois Pierre Corbi√®re was born in Amanlis, near Rennes, Ille-et-Vilaine, on 22 May 1766. He was from a family of laborers. He was at first destined to become a priest, but chose to study law and was admitted to the bar in Rennes. After the French Revolution he became commissioner of the Directory for the municipal administration of Rennes. On 25 Germinal in the year V Corbi√®re was elected deputy for Ille-et-Vilaine in the Council of Five Hundred. He did not play a notable role in the council. Corbi√®re was charged as a lawyer with managing the estate of Isaac Ren√© Guy le Chapelier, president of the National Constituent Assembly, who had died by the guillotine in 1794. On 10 Niv√¥se in the year VIII he married le Chapelier's widow, Marie-Esther de la Marre, said to be the most beautiful woman in Rennes. She was also richly endowed by her brother, Mathurin de la Marre. Corbi√®re himself was described as ugly, lame, and with his head buried in the shoulders. The brilliant match helped advance his career, and under the First French Empire he became president of the general council of Ille-et-Vilaine. Bourbon Restoration After the fall of the Empire, Corbi√®re became a royalist. On 22 August 1815 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as representative for the Ille-et-Vilaine department. He sat on the right, beside Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le. He was reelected on 4 October 1816. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Law in Rennes, and on 20 September 1817 he was again reelected. He took a consistently conservative position. After the assassination of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry. he said that \\"the way to have good deputies is to have a royalist ministry and censored newspapers.\\" On 21 December 1820 Corbi√®re was made a Minister of State and president of the Royal Council of Public Education. He wanted to give the church the leading role in education. In face of growing liberal and irreligious views among college students, Corbi√®re suppressed the √âcole Normale in Paris and other faculties. He resigned in September 1821 due to opposition to the Simeon- Pasquier cabinet, and returned to Brittany to campaign for the next election. The majority of those elected were opposed to the cabinet, which was dissolved. On 14 December 1821 Vill√®le was charged with forming a government. Corbi√®re was given the Interior portfolio, and was made a count by the king. Corbi√®re fired many personnel, fought liberal education and freedom of the press, tried several times to reestablish censorship, and in 1824 tried to buy all the ultra-royalist newspapers, which gave his department difficulty but were hard to prosecute. He was able to buy the Drapeau blanc, the Gazette de France, the Journal de Paris and other papers, but could not acquire the Quotidienne. M. Michaud had four twelfths of the shares and refused to sell. Michaud was taken to court, but won on appeal. Corbi√®re dissolved the National Guard of Paris in 1827. He lost his portfolio when the cabinet resigned on 4 January 1828. The same day he was made a Minister of State, member of the privy council, knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit and a peer of France. Last years Corbi√®re refused to give swear allegiance to Louis Philippe I after the July Revolution of 1830, and left the chamber of peers. He retired to Brittany, where he became a passionate collector of old editions of the classics. Corbi√®re died in Rennes on 12 January 1853. He was aged 86.

This 1¬Ω-story wood frame house was built in the early 1860s, and is a well-preserved example of a period farmhouse. It is architecturally distinctive because of a rear saltbox style addition, and its shed-roof dormers. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The George Cheever Farm is located in a rural setting northwest of the village center of Harrisville, standing on a knoll close to the V-shaped junction of Nelson and Tolman Pond Roads. It is a 1¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is three bays wide, with the left two obscured by an enclosed shed-roof porch. The front roof face is pierced by two shed-roof dormers, and the rear is extended by a saltbox-style ell, whose roof is at a lower pitch than the main roof. A single-story ell extends to the left side of the main block. The exterior styling of the house is vernacular, with simple corner boards and window surrounds. The house was built sometime between 1860 and 1863 by George Cheever, a farmer. The house is one of a modest number of mid-19th century farmhouses surviving in the town, and bears some resemblance to the slightly earlier Jabez Townsend House.

She was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the Labor Party in the Division of Denison at the 2014 state election. She ran as a Labor candidate and was defeated at the 2018 state election, but re-entered parliament as an Independent MP in September 2019, replacing Scott Bacon who quit the Parliament. Early life and education Ogilvie grew up in Lenah Valley, Tasmania. She was educated at The Friends' School, Hobart College and the University of Melbourne, where she resided at Ormond College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Studies. She later obtained a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Tasmania, and a Graduate Certificate in Business from the Australian Graduate School of Management. Legal career Ogilvie was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in 1994. She was a lawyer at the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, Allens and CSIRO. She then worked for UNESCO in France on international cultural heritage law, Indonesia on telecommunications infrastructure projects, and the United States of America, in Silicon Valley. She was later General Manager Commercial and Contracts with Telstra Corporation responsible for some of Australia's largest telecommunications deals. Ogilvie returned to Hobart, Tasmania to raise her family. In 2006 she established a legal practice in Hobart, Ogilvie and Associates. Ogilvie is known for her advocacy of refugee rights.  Political career  Ogilvie first stood for election to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the 2010 state election. She received 522 first preference votes, but was not elected. She was elected at the March 2014 election, receiving 2,156 votes and being the fifth of five candidates elected for the Denison division under the state's Hare-Clark system. Ogilvie was the only new Labor member elected in an election that saw the Labor Party lose government and several seats. Following the 2014 election, Ogilvie was appointed Shadow Minister for Corrections, Aboriginal Affairs, Small Business, Information Technology and Innovation, and Multicultural Affairs, as well as being appointed Opposition Whip. Ogilvie briefly made local headlines in December 2015 after voting, in a free vote, against a Tasmanian Greens party motion supporting marriage equality on the basis that it is a federal legislative reform, and in particular her online reaction to the Left faction of the Tasmanian Labor Party drawing a chalk rainbow outside her electorate office and writing defamatory messages on her office. Members of the Left called for Ogilvie to be expelled from the party for not supporting the Greens motion. Ogilvie again came under fire from Labor's Left faction at the Party's 2017 State Conference when she voted against a bill to allow euthanasia in Tasmania. Labor leader Rebecca White allowed a conscience vote, as the motion was put forward as a private member's bill. Ogilvie is a passionate advocate against pokies and revenge porn. Her stance on pokies was later adopted by the Party. She has also advocated for statewide discussion on Aboriginal treaty rights. Personal life Ogilvie is the granddaughter of former Member of the House of Assembly Eric Ogilvie, great-niece of former Premier of Tasmania Albert Ogilvie and stepdaughter of former Governor of Tasmania Peter Underwood. She is married to William Doyle, with four children.

As an HEI, PNTC Colleges offers Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation (BSMT), Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering (BSMarE), Bachelor of Science in Customs Administration (BSCA), Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA), Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology (BSAT), and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), major in Marketing and Operations Management. As an MET provider, PNTC Colleges offers courses pursuant to the 1978 IMO Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), as amended. With a growing population of approximately 4,500 students and tens of thousands of trainees per year, and four major sites in Intramuros, Manila, Tanza and Dasmari√±as, Cavite, and in Aurora Boulevard, it is considered as one of the biggest maritime educational institutions in the country. History Founded on April 18, 1994 by Atty. Hernani N. Fabia, PNTC Colleges was originally named as Philippine Nautical Training Institute or PNTI. Its primary purpose then was to provide basic and specialized courses pursuant to the 1978 International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). On December 6, 2001, PNTI became Philippine Nautical and Technological College with the intention to expand its primary purpose to operate as a maritime institution with three-fold functions, i.e., as a Maritime College, Maritime Training Center and a Seafarers Competency Assessment Center. The name change highlighted the expansion as PNTC began to offer college courses such as Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation and Bachelor of Science in Customs Administration. On October 29, 2004, Philippine Nautical and Technological College was later changed to simply PNTC Colleges, which has now become the official name. The purpose was to embrace its roots as Philippine Nautical Technological Colleges but at the same time, usher in a new era for the school. PNTC Colleges began to offer courses not limited to the Maritime industry, such as Bachelor of Science in Accountancy, Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. Accreditation PNTC Colleges has consistently complied with the standards of excellence required by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Standard of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW).

It consists of a modified cell line that has been stably transfected with a DNA construct with a luciferase reporter gene under control of receptor-specific DNA response elements that can stimulate transcription of the inserted luciferase gene and produce the light-generating enzyme which can be easily measured. The DNA response elements can be varied in order to provide binding sites for other receptors that are regulated by a chemical or class of chemicals of interest that want to be detected. Thus, numerous CALUX bioassays have been developed for detection of diverse chemicals of interest. Most applications have been directed toward the detection of environmentally harmful chemicals, such as those affecting the endocrine system (environmental hormones). CALUX is an effect based screening method as it measures the total effect ligands (from a sample) have on a specific receptor. Unlike chemical analysis, CALUX is thus able to measure total activity on the receptor of interest. This includes both identified and unidentified activators (agonists) and inhibitors (receptor antagonists). Applications The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-responsive (AhR-CALUX) bioassay is commonly used in the detection of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in sample extracts. It is based on the molecular mechanism by which the AhR activates gene expression. AhR-CALUX is used by researchers and companies that want to screen for the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in a wide variety of biological and environmental matrices, commercial and consumer products and in food and feed in order to evaluate their safety and/or level of contamination. While the measurement of dioxin and related dioxin-like chemicals in a sample extract using the AhR-CALUX bioassay is significantly cheaper than the chemical analysis requiring gas chromatography - high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS), it only provides a measurement of the total level of AhR-active dioxins and related dioxin-like chemicals in a sample extract and determination of the specific congeners requires analysis any GC-HRMS. Additionally, given the recently established role of the AhR in human health and disease, the AhR-CALUX bioassay is also being used widely as a high-throughput screening method to identify and characterize AhR-active chemicals as potential human therapeutic drugs. Environmental chemicals having sex hormone-like activity are detected by similar bioassays as well, including the Estrogen Receptor-Responsive CALUX (ER-CALUX) and Androgen Receptor-Responsive CALUX (AR-CALUX).

She possesses the Scissor Blade, one half of the that Isshin created to destroy uniforms empowered by Life Fibers. At the start of the series, she acquires a special \\"kamui\\" uniform named , which grants her special abilities. She lives with the Mankanshoku family. Ryuko is later revealed to be Satsuki's presumed dead younger sister during the battle at the Honnouji Academy Cultural & Sports Grand Festival, revealed to have become a human infused with Life Fibers as the result of her being experimented on as a newborn baby by their mother Ragyo. =Satsuki Kiryuin= is the ruthless student council president of Honnouji Academy of 18-year-old, administers Goku Uniforms to students using various hierarchical schemes such as a no-late day event and battle royale-esque tournaments such as the Naturals Election. She wields a katana named which can sever Life Fibers, later dons Kiryuin Family's kamui after Ryuko arrived to the school. She serves as a major opponent to Ryuko for most of the series. After having learned the true nature of the Life Fibers from her father at an early age, revealing she set up Honnouji Academy to oppose her mother, Satsuki attempts to assassinate Ragyo during the Honnouji Academy Cultural & Sports Grand Festival to celebrate subjugating every school in Japan. During the resulting fight, Satsuki learns Ryuko is her presumed dead younger sister before being captured. After being freed by Nudist Beach, Satsuki makes amends with Ryuko before they team up to face Ragyo in the series finale. In the OVA epilogue, Satsuki closed down Honnouji Academy as fulfilled its purpose while giving Rei closure. =Mako Mankanshoku= is an energetic second-year student who is Ryuko's classmate and best friend. She immediately befriends Ryuko upon the latter's arrival at the school. Mako lives with her parents and younger brother in the slums of Honn≈ç City. She is described as an \\"uber air-head\\" whose \\"unbelievable actions never cease to shock and awe the people around her.\\" Despite putting herself in dangerous situations, she has a good heart and cares for Ryuko, providing her with constant encouragement. Senketsu notes that Mako is vital for getting Ryuko to relax. In the episode where she runs the Fight Club, she receives a two-star Goku Uniform styled like that of a delinquent. =Senketsu= is a talking sailor uniform that Ryuko finds beneath her house. He is a , an outfit made entirely of Life Fibers, which provides its wearer with superhuman abilities in exchange for their blood. Initially, it absorbs a large amount of her blood and only allows her to act for a limited time, however, it is soon able to fully synchronize with Ryuko as she gets over her embarrassment of wearing such a skimpy outfit. Whenever Ryuko destroys a Goku Uniform, Senketsu absorbs its Life Fiber. Mikisugi later reveals that Issei Matoi designed Senketsu from Ryuko's DNA to enable her to fight against the propagators of the Life Fibers. It was only after the revelation of Ryuko's hybrid nature that Senketsu is revealed to be partially human. Though Ryuko defeats Ragyo, Senketsu starts dissolving from having absorbed both their allies' Life Fiber clothing and Ragyo's as he uses his final moments to safely get Ryuko back to Earth. Supporting characters =Honnouji Academy Elite Four= The are the leaders in Satsuki's student council. They wear Three-Star Goku Uniforms. Uzu Sanageyama regulates the athletic clubs at Honnouji Academy, including the Boxing Club and the Tennis Club. He himself specializes in kendo and possesses the three-star Goku Uniform, , which takes the form of a large armored b≈çgu. He initially possesses , which allows to him to predict his opponent's moves with super fast eyesight. However, after suffering a defeat from Ryuko, he chooses to have his eyes sewn shut, heightening his other senses and giving him a more powerful , which allows him to perceive things with no blind spots. During the final battle with Ragyo, he unseals his eyes, not wanting to hold back against her. He also receives upgraded uniforms such as Blade Regalia MK II, Blade Regalia MK.III, and Blade Regalia: Secret Unsealed. Houka Inumuta is in charge of Honnouji Academy's information and strategy committee, aiding the student council by analyzing the performance of Goku Uniforms and kamui in battle, and helping the Sewing Club with upgraded uniforms. His three-star Goku Uniform, , allows him to quickly calculate attack trajectories and use optical camouflage to hide from his opponents. Upgrades include Probe Regalia MK.II, that makes him appear as a polygonal model, and his ultimate uniform of Probe Regalia: Truth Unveiled. Ira Gamagoori is a large, muscular man who is Satsuki's loyal enforcer who leads the disciplinary committee at Honnouji Academy. His three-star Goku Uniform is the , which takes the form of bondage gear. By enduring such masochistic attacks, he can activate its second transformation, , which covers his body in thorny whips. His upgraded uniform, Shackle Regalia MK.II, resembles a sarcophagus, and his ultimate uniform is the Shackle Regalia: Persona Unleashed. He is 20 years old, having waited two years after graduating Rinne-D≈ç Junior High before enrolling at Honnouji to assist Satsuki with her plans. He drives a pink 1959 Cadillac Eldorado. Nonon Jakuzure regulates the school's non-athletic clubs, such as Gardening Club and Biology Club. Among the members of the Elite Four, she has been with Satsuki since kindergarten and thus claims that she knows her best. She possesses the three-star Goku Uniform , which transforms into a giant sound system that produces powerful soundwaves and can transform into a flying airship. Later, she receives an upgraded version, Symphony Regalia MK.II, that miniaturizes the airship in a jetpack. Her ultimate uniform is Symphony Regalia: Finale. =Mankanshoku family= The is Mako's family that resides within Honn≈ç City's slums. They take Ryuko in after the latter transfers to Honnouji Academy. Barazo Mankanshoku is Mako's father. He is a doctor that runs a back-alley clinic in Hann≈ç City's slums. Barazo admits that he may have killed more patients than he has saved. Sukuyo Mankanshoku is Mako's mother. She is a carefree housewife who is kind to Ryuko, and makes croquettes with mystery meats. Mataro Mankanshoku is Mako's younger brother. He is a delinquent who initially tries to rob Ryuko when he first encounters her. Guts is the Mankanshoku family pug. He is dressed in a light bluish-grey hooded sweater. In episode 2, Mataro says that they named him Guts \\"because he eats with a lot of gusto\\". = Nudist Beach = Aikuro Mikisugi is Ryuko's enigmatic homeroom teacher. He secretly observes and aids Ryuko by leading her to Senketsu. Whilst generally having the appearance of a frail, shaggy teacher, he is actually a glamorous smooth- talker with a habit of slowly stripping his clothes and making moves on Ryuko whenever they are in private, much to Ryuko's embarrassment. Aikuro reveals to Ryuko the existence of Nudist Beach and his being one of its members (though she did not believe him due to the organization's ridiculous name). Whenever he strips, pink light radiates from his nipples and from his crotch, obscuring them. Mikisugi's character design is based on people such as TM Network's vocalist Takashi Utsunomiya and Kenji Sawada, people who appear smart and good-looking. Tsumugu Kinagase is a scientist at the Nudist Beach organization and an acquaintance of Aikuro who sports a red mohawk on top of short black hair. He bears a strong hatred of kamui, which stems from an experiment where his close sister, , died when the kamui she had volunteered to test ran her blood dry. His weapon is a sewing machine pistol that fires needles which severs the connections between the Life Fibers in kamui and Goku Uniforms and their wearers. The needles also act like acupuncture, in that it can immobilize opponents and invigorate them afterward. His catchphrase is . Isshin Matoi is Ryuko's deceased father, and the creator of Senketsu and the Scissor Blades. He was murdered by Nui, who stole the purple blade, whilst he left the red blade to Ryuko. He is also the founder of Nudist Beach, an organization created to oppose Revocs. He is actually , Satsuki's father and Ragyo's husband, who faked his death and took on the identity of Isshin Matoi to raise Ryuko. = REVOCS = Ragyo Kiryuin is Ryuko and Satsuki's mother and the main antagonist of the series, being both Director of Honnouji Academy and the CEO of the Revocs Corporation which manufactures and supplies a preponderance of the world's clothing with her product laced with Life Fibers. Ragyo has aspirations of ruling the Earth through the , the source of all Life Fibers on Earth, turning herself into a human/Life Fiber hybrid to be essentially immortal as long her head is still connected to her body by a single Life Fiber thread or her heart is not destroyed. One of her abilities is Mind Stitch where she imbued Life Fibers into peoples' heads to control like puppets. She eventually dons the wedding dress-like ultimate kamui, Shinra-Kotetsu, gaining the ability which allows her to manipulate anything made of Life Fibers except Senketsu. While Shinra-Kotetsu was originally powered by Rei Honoumaru, Ragyo had it absorb Harime and the Primordial Life Fiber commence her end game. After Ryuko reverses the Life Fiber takeover after Senketsu assimilated Shinra-Kotetsu, Ragyo chooses to crush her heart rather than accept defeat on anyone's terms but her own, warning Ryuko that the other Life Fibers in the universe will eventually come to Earth and finish what she started. Nui Harime is the Grand Couturier (High Order Tailor) of the Kiryuin family, initially appearing as a petite twin tailed girl with a parasol and wearing an eyepatch. She has sociopathic tendencies, smiling and acting cheerful even when revealing to Ryuko that she killed her father and stole half of his Rending Scissors, at the cost of her eye. She later reveals that she is actually a human/Life Fiber hybrid that was incubated within the Primordial Life Fiber, with superhuman abilities such as tearing apart Life Fibers in Goku Uniforms and kamuis, manipulating people's minds with Mental Stitching, healing from severe cuts to her body, cloning herself, and changing her appearance. The only time in the series where she loses her cool is when Ryuko severs her arms at the Life Fiber level. She helps create Ragyo's kamui Shinra-Kotetsu and sacrifices herself at Ragyo's request to help the latter attain her ultimate power. Rei Hououmaru is a Revocs corporate officer and Ragyo's personal secretary. Before she was adopted by Ragyo as a child, she had lived in a wartorn African village whose inhabitants were said to have a unique resistance to Life Fibers. Following Ragyo's death, Rei attempted to exact revenge by using Life Fiber-based clones of Satsuki and her Elite Four to disrupt Honnouji Academy's graduation ceremony. Other characters =Takiji Kuroido= is the head steward to the Kiryuin family. He reports directly to Ragyo and takes care of the Kiryuin Mansion. =Mitsuzo Soroi= is Satsuki's personal and trusted butler, having served her since her early childhood. He is also Shiro Iori's uncle. Soroi often serves tea to Satsuki, but he also serves tea to the Elite Four, and later the Nudist Beach members when they go to rescue Satsuki. He wears a three-piece suit. =Kaneo Takarada= is the student council president of Naniwa Kinman High School in the Osaka region, his family's wealth rivals that of the Kiruyins as he secretly funded Nudist Beach. Takarada uses his Takarada-printed money to have locals fight Kiryuin's forces for him when they arrives to both conquer his school and destroy the Nudist Beach base located in the city. After Ragyo and the Covers take over Japan, Takarada spends his remaining fortune to complete Nudist Beach's battleship Naked Sol. \\\\- fourth picture =Honnouji Academy club leaders= Shiro Iori is the president of Honnouji Academy's Sewing Club, which works on improving and upgrading the Goku Uniforms.

History of the Red River Valley Conference of the Augustana Lutheran Church. Blair, NE: Lutheran Publishing House, 1953. Originally, the conference included both the Red River Valley as well as North Dakota to the west and extended to the St. Paul District to the east, covering about 300 miles west to east and 50 miles north to south. Organizations within the Red River Valley Conference included the Women‚Äôs Missionary Society, Young Women‚Äôs Society, Junior Missionary Society, Luther League, and Lutheran Brotherhood. The Conference‚Äôs Board of Charities also proposed and managed Warren Hospital, Bethany Home for the Aged, and Bethany Children‚Äôs Home. Educational institutions of the Red River Valley Conference included Hope Academy of Moorhead, MN (1888-1896), Lund Academy of Christine Lake, MN (1899-1901), Northwestern College of Fergus Falls, MN (1900-1932), and North Star College of Warren, MN (1908-1936). Districts = Alexandria District = The Alexandria District was originally a mission field and the first district within the conference. The first congregation in the Alexandria District was organized at Oscar Lake in 1866 and served by Pastor J. P. Lundblad. The formal organization of the district did not take place until September 1879, by which time it had grown to 19 congregations with over 700 members. Due to growing membership and geographical size, in 1898 the Alexandria District split into three districts: Central District, Red River District, and James River District (North Dakota). Both Lund Academy and Northwestern College were established in the Alexandria District to provide educational opportunities to members of the region. Lund Academy, located in Christine Lake operated from 1899 to 1901 while Northwestern College of Fergus Falls ran substantially longer, operating from 1900 to 1932. Northwestern offered courses in six areas, including the Academic, Normal, and Preparatory departments as well as the Schools of Commerce, Music, and Art. = Bemidji District = St. John‚Äôs was the first congregation in the Bemidji District and was founded in 1881 in Fertile.

At the time of its organization it was composed of 12 congregations with over 1,000 members. = Fargo and North Dakota Districts = The James River District that was formed in 1898 split into the North Dakota District and Fargo District in 1909. The first congregation, Maple Sheyenne, was established in North Dakota in 1878 and was led by Pastor A. P. Monten. = Red River District = The Red River District was created from the division of the Alexandria District in November 1886 and comprised the northern part of the conference. In 1881 Pastor J. G. Lagerstrom organized the first congregation in the district, the Black River Church near St. Hilaire. Located in Moorhead, Minn. within the Red River District, Hope Academy was established by the Lutheran Benevolent Society in November 1888. The Academy offered scientific, classical, musical, and special English courses, and many students participated in the Star Lyceum Literary Society. Hope Academy was forced to close in 1896 due to declining numbers of the surrounding congregations.

Early life and education Fleming was born in 1925, reportedly in Switzerland.G. R. Seaman, 'Fleming, Amaryllis Marie-Louise (1925?‚Äì1999)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2012 accessed 28 March 2014 She was the illegitimate daughter of the painter Augustus John by his mistress Eve Fleming, mother of the writers Peter Fleming and Ian Fleming by her late husband, although most of her life she was raised as the adopted daughter of Eve Fleming as a pretence to hide her illegitimacy and only discovered her true parentage when she was in her twenties. Fleming was thus a niece to John's sister Gwen and aunt to actress Lucy Fleming. She went away to school at Downe House in Berkshire, but went up to London every three weeks for cello lessons with John Snowden. In 1943 she won a scholarship to study full-time with Ivor James at the Royal College of Music. She later studied at times under Gaspar Cassad√≥, Enrico Mainardi, Pablo Casals, Guilhermina Suggia and Pierre Fournier. Career She established herself as a performer throughout the 1950s, winning the prestigious Queen's Prize in 1952, making her debut the following year at The Proms, the annual classical music series at London's Royal Albert Hall, and playing with notable musicians throughout Europe. Her career was overshadowed by the rise of Jacqueline du Pr√© in the 1960s and she concentrated on chamber music, being especially known for the Fleming Trio with pianist Bernard Roberts and violinist Manoug Parikian. She also became a pioneer of baroque cello music and \\"ground-breakingly, she became the first person this century to play Bach's Sixth suite in the manner its composer had intended.\\" At times she owned cellos by Amati, Guarneri and Stradivari.Cozio.com: cello by Girolamo Amati, 1600c (Amaryllis Fleming)New York Times: No High Bidders at Auction of 1717 Fleming Cello Made by Stradivari She also made an appearance in the 1969 film Connecting Rooms as the arms and fingers of Bette Davis, who portrayed a cellist in the film.New York Times: Amaryllis Fleming, 73, Cellist Devoted to Baroque Music Later life and reputation Her playing career ended in 1993 following a stroke, but she continued to teach at the Royal College of Music and Wells Cathedral School.The Guardian: Amaryllis Fleming: A dedicated and talented cellist who worked with some of the greatest musicians of her day but was seldom recorded Her notable pupils include Raphael Wallfisch.

It is part of the Private Snafu series. As in all the Snafu films, the voice of Private Snafu is performed by Mel Blanc.Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 196-197  Plot  Outpost used humor to instruct service personnel. A narrator informs viewers that the United States maintain far- flung military outposts, manned by diligent sentinels. The film then introduces an outpost on a tiny Pacific island, where under its single palm tree lies the local sentinel, Private Snafu. His only companion is a local bird. Snafu loudly complains about his 249 days on the island without getting involved in any fighting, and a message coming over the radio informs him that his 249th request for a transfer has been denied. Snafu and this bird get to sleep and dream about girls. Their dreams get mixed up and irate Snafu wakes up, threatening to break the bird for insubordination. The dejected bird locates a floating can of food, eager to eat the contents until he learns it is \\"Pickled Fish Eyes with Rice\\". Disgusted, he nearly throws the can out before noticing the bottom text: \\"Hon. K Ration Imperial Japanese Navy.\\" Snafu is not interested in the bird's finding, and orders the bird to bury it. The United States military is tracking a Japanese task force by means of reference points until the observation posts lose track of it, so the officers call all observation posts to give a full report. Private Snafu does so by reciting his day's seemingly mundane records from his log book; when his superiors hear of the tin-can entry in Snafu's report, they radio him again almost immediately, ordering Snafu to repeat the tin-can entry and confirm its description. The bird digs it up and Snafu reports its food label and Japanese information. American bombers quickly arrive and bomb the Japanese fleet into oblivion. The day ends with Snafu and his bird sitting on their tiny beach; with Snafu unaware of the Japanese fleet being annihilated, he again remarks his boredom. \\"Pickled fish eyes with rice; I don't get it. Wouldn't you think they could find something important for me to do in this here army?\\" as he throws the can into the ocean and the day ends. Analysis  This is considered a transitional film in the series, with Snafu successfully able to complete a mission despite his discomfort and being unaware of the importance of the task.

It was incorporated in May 2010 in London, England, by Andy Puddicombe and Richard Pierson. It is headquartered in Santa Monica, California, with offices in San Francisco and London. The company mainly operates through its online platform, which provides sessions of guided meditation to its registered users with the goal of mindfulness. Overall content is offered through a freemium subscription service model. History Andy Puddicombe, co-founder of Headspace Headspace was founded in May 2010, by Andy Puddicombe and Richard Pierson. Puddicombe is a former Buddhist monk, and Pierson has a background in marketing and new brand development. Puddicombe cut short his university studies in Sports Science at the age of 22 and travelled to Asia to become a Buddhist monk. He was fully ordained at a Tibetan Monastery in the Himalayas. In 2004, he returned to the UK on a mission \\"to make meditation accessible, relevant and beneficial to as many people as possible\\". It was whilst running a meditation clinic in London that he met his future business partner, Rich Pierson. Headspace began as an events company, holding mindfulness talks in and around London. Demand from attendees for a way to share these techniques led to Puddicombe and Pierson looking into developing a mobile app, with the first version of the Headspace app launching in 2012. Headspace employs over 100 staff, working between the Los Angeles, San Francisco and London offices. In June 2017, Headspace hired Ross Hoffman as Chief Business Officer. In June 2018, the company launched Headspace Health, a subsidiary aimed at developing FDA-approved meditation tools which would be prescribed to help treat a range of chronic diseases. Product Headspace provides guided meditation resources online, accessible to users through the company's website and via a mobile app on the iPhone and Android platforms. Users can access ten days of free content, after which they have the option to take out a monthly or annual subscription or continue with the free trial material. In June 2014, Headspace launched version 2 of its platform. Content in version 2 of the app focused on four areas once users have completed the Foundation stage: health, performance, relationships and Headspace Pro. The app uses gamification to encourage users to complete and master a level of meditation before moving on to a more advanced section. Each session is about ten minutes long, usually in audio format. Research Headspace has been used in a number of clinical trials investigating the effects of mindfulness training. In one such study, researchers from UCL, funded by the British Heart Foundation, examined the impact of mindfulness on workplace stress in two major multi-national corporations, using the Headspace app as the intervention. The study found a significant increase in wellbeing, reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, significant reductions in diastolic blood pressures, significant increases in perceived job control, as well as a significant reduction in sleeping problems. Publications Three books by Headspace founder Andy Puddicombe are published by Hodder & Stoughton. *Get Some Headspace (2011) comprises an introduction to the Headspace techniques, interwoven with Puddicombe's personal experience. It lays out the science behind mindfulness and its physical and mental health benefits, from productivity and focus to stress and anxiety relief. *The Headspace Diet (2013) teaches readers how to use mindfulness rather than fad diets to reach their ideal personal weight. The book focuses on teaching readers about creating a healthy relationship with food. *The Headspace Guide to... a Mindful Pregnancy (2015) instructs couples how to calmly navigate the anxieties and demands of pregnancy. Media attention Headspace has been featured on both UK and US television, appearing on The Today Show,Today Show profile http://www.today.com/klgandhoda/monk-turned-circus-performer-reveals- how-relax-1D80380965 BBC Breakfast News, ABC News, and The Dr. Oz Show. It was also featured on the BBC Two science documentary Horizon, which tested the efficacy of mindfulness using the Headspace app over an 8-week period. In laboratory experiments, the presenter, Dr. Michael Mosley, was found to have significantly reduced negative outlook. He also reported overcoming a decade- long battle with insomnia. The product has also been mentioned on NPR and in publications such as Martha Stewart in the US. In November 2012, Headspace founder Andy Puddicombe gave a TED Talk, entitled \\"All It Takes Is 10 Mindful Minutes\\", outlining the benefits of taking time out each day to practise mindfulness.

The restaurant got media coverage due its architecture designed by SOMA, a New York City based firm. The restaurant is owned by Michael Beckman and Joseph Mourani. Development Michael Beckman and Joseph Mourani are two chefs who met in France studying at the Paul Bocuse Institute in Lyon. The friends partnered up in 2012 to open Workshop Kitchen + Bar. Joseph is primarily focused on hospitality and music projects in Beirut (Standard, Stereo Kitchen, Ballroom Blitz), and Michael oversees Workshop's cuisine and management. A Southern California native, Chef Michael Beckman is a driving force in the evolution of the region‚Äôs dining scene, evidenced at his Palm Springs, California restaurant Workshop Kitchen + Bar and cocktail haven Truss & Twine. While attending the University of San Francisco, he worked in front-of-house positions at Italian restaurants in North Beach. It was then that he fell in love with restaurant culture and developed passions for cuisine and wine. His affinity for wine and European regional cooking landed him in Geneva, Switzerland. For two years, he cooked at an eclectic centre ville bistro, a traditional countryside French restaurant near Geneva‚Äôs vineyards, and at a sushi hot spot, where he honed his knife skills as a fishmonger. Determined to join the brigades of a 3 Michelin-star restaurant, Beckman saw Lyon‚Äôs prestigious L‚ÄôInstitute Paul Bocuse as a gateway to the next level. He spent the next two years under the wing of four Meilleur Oeuvriers de France instructors at IPB, as well as apprenticing at Burgundy‚Äôs 3 Michelin-star ‚ÄúLameloise‚Äù. Ultimately landing a Chef de Partie position with Ritz Carlton, Berlin, where he cooked under Austrian Chef Thomas Kellermann. Beckman later returned to California and held a series of elite private chef positions in Beverly Hills, Las Vegas and Rancho Mirage. Shopping the farmers‚Äô markets each week and keeping pace with restaurant trends sparked his vision for and desire to open his own brick-and-mortar concept. In 2012, Beckman opened Workshop Kitchen + Bar, which has had a major impact on the community‚Äôs dining scene and contributed to re-branding Palm Springs as a dining destination. Hitting the mark with his seasonal cooking that utilizes fresh and local desert ingredients, contemporary and classic cocktails, and industrial modern design, Workshop Kitchen + Bar has gone on to be one of Southern California‚Äôs most critically acclaimed restaurants, gaining media recognition and a plethora of awards, including the 2015 James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurant Design. On the heels of this success, Beckman opened his second concept, Truss & Twine, adjacent to his first venture. Truss & Twine specializes in classic cocktails broken down by five eras, alongside a desert-inspired menu using ingredients sourced from the Coachella Valley. Providing a dark juxtaposition to the adjacent restaurant, Truss & Twine delivered an aesthetic that the Palm Springs dining and nightlife landscape was missing. In 2018, Beckman announced he will be opening a second outpost of Workshop Kitchen + Bar, bringing a taste of the desert to Los Angeles‚Äô diverse culinary scene in 2020.

TEP1 was first identified as a key immunity gene in 2001 through functional studies on Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. TEP1 is an antimicrobial protein which acts in a system reminiscent of the human complement pathway, which damages the cell membranes of pathogens. Studies have shown that TEP1 is structurally and functionally homologous to the human complement protein C3. TEP1 is now known to be important in the resistance of Anopheles mosquitoes to Plasmodium infection, targeting the malaria parasite during its invasion into the mosquitoes body cavity. Following this discovery insect thioester containing proteins have come under increased scrutiny from the scientific community as possible targets for disease control. TEP1 is coded for by two different alleles TEP1-S and TEP-R which are specific to susceptible and resistant mosquito populations respectively.  Structure  Schematic of thioester bond: TEP1 contains a highly conserved thioester which enables the covalent labelling of parasites. Several crystallography studies have been used to determine the structure of TEP1. TEP1 contains a highly reactive thioester motif, which can undergo spontaneous hydrolysis. The thioester group is functionally essential for TEP1 to covalently bind to the surface of invading pathogens. Tep1 is a multimeric protein, meaning it is formed of multiple associated polypetide chains. TEP1 is composed of a series of 6 macroglobulin domains, a Œ≤ sheet CUB domain and an essential thioester domain, which protects the thioester motif from premature activation and hydrolysis by shielding it in the core of the molecule. Comparisons of the TEP1-S and TEP1-R gene products show that the two allelic variants encode structural differences which are particularly prevalent in the thioester domain. These differences alter both the stability of the thioester bond and the ability of TEP1 to interact with other factors in the hemolymph of the mosquito. = C3 homology = The structure of TEP1 and its vertebrate homologue - complement protein C3- is mostly conserved. However, there are some differences between the two molecules, for example unlike C3, TEP1 lacks an anaphylatoxin domain. The absence of this domain means that the exposed thioester bond of active TEP1 is unstable. = Maturation = TEP1 Maturation: TEP1-F is cleaved into TEP1-Cut. The TEP1 protein is glycosylated and secreted into the body cavity by mosquito immune cells as a 165 kDa zymogen - this inactivated form is known as TEP1-F. Upon parasite infection TEP1-F is cleaved. A protease processes the full length molecule into two fragments which remain closely associated: a ~75 kDa N-terminal and an ~85 kDa C-terminal fragment which contains the thioester bond. The cleaved protein is known as TEP1-cut and represents the activated form. This mechanism is equivalent to the maturation of vertebrate pro-C3 to active C3 which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent work has suggested the two forms of TEP1, the full TEP1-F and TEP1-cut, have separate roles.  Function  TEP1 is a central component in the mosquito's immune response against invading parasites such as Plasmodium. Similar to the complement protein C3 in function, TEP1 acts as an opsonin which facilitates extensive parasite killing. TEP1 covalently binds to the surface of invading pathogens, promoting phagocytosis, lysis and melanisation. Through this activity TEP1 is considered an important determinant of Anopheles vector capacity. TEP1 is an antimicrobial peptide which associates with APL1C/LRIM1 heterodimers to act as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) which identifies and responds to specific patterns on pathogen cell surfaces. Studies have shown TEP1 to be a key molecule in limiting parasite numbers in mosquitoes.RNA interference(RNAi) experiments have illustrated the importance of TEP1 in clearing malaria infections in mosquitoes. RNAi knockdown of TEP1 using dsRNA resulted in a five-fold increase of Plasmodium oocysts in TEP1-S silenced mosquitoes. Knock down of TEP1-R stops parasite melanisation. Anopheles gambiae mosquito : TEP1 is a key protein in the mosquito immune response against malarial parasites = Activation = TEP1-F is secreted into the hemolymph where it is processed by a currently unknown protease into its active form ‚Äì the two chained molecule TEP1-Cut. Cleavage into the cut form is followed by a change in protein structure which exposes the thioester bond. This conformational change enables TEP1 to react and covalently bind to molecules on the surface of invading pathogens. = Regulation = The expression of TEP1 and other genes involved in the mosquito's anti-parasitic response is a highly regulated process. The base level of TEP1 expression is regulated by insect Toll and IMD pathways. These immune pathways limit the expression of TEP1 coding genes through NF-kB/ REL transcription factors. TEP1 interacts with a heterodimeric protein complex made up of two leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain containing proteins: leucine-rich immune molecule 1 (LRIM1) and Anopheles Plasmodium- responsive leucine-rich repeat protein 1 (APL1C). The LRR molecules have two main roles: firstly acting as control proteins which prevent the inactivation of TEP1 through hydrolysis of the thioester bond or binding to self -tissues and secondly mediate the binding of TEP1 to pathogen surfaces. Schematic illustrating the basic structures of LRIM1 and APl1C. The LRIM1/APL1C heterodimer has three domains, combining the elements of a N-terminal LRR region, a pattern of cysteine residues and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. These features determine how the complex interacts with TEP1.  Complement pathway activity  The complement system was previously thought to be an exclusive feature of the immune defense of vertebrates until complement-like molecules were cloned in non-vertebrate species such as the horseshoe crab and mosquitoes. The discovery of C3 like molecules in a diverse range of species suggests that the complement pathway in particular the alternative complement pathway is evolutionary ancient. The TEP1 cascade most closely resembles the alternative pathway as insects do not possess adaptive immunity. Therefore, unlike the classical complement pathway the TEP1 pathway is antibody independent and instead relies on the presence of factors permanently present at low levels in the hemolymph. Furthermore, both the TEP1 pathway and the alternative pathway utilise convertase mediated amplification loops to increase pathogen opsonisation. = Convergent evolution = Thioester containing protein (TEPs) appeared early in animal evolution: members of this family have been identified in diverse organisms as nematodes, insects, molluscs, fish, birds and mammals. TEP1 in Anopheles gambiae is the one of the best studied of these molecules. Despite close structural and functional similarities, phylogenic analysis has shown that TEP1 and other arthropod thioester proteins actually form a separate clade from vertebrate complement factors. This data suggests that their complement-like activity is a likely example of parallel evolution. Further research is needed into this area.  Potential use in malaria control  The characterization of TEP1 and other similar insect immune factors in insects represent new opportunities to prevent the transmission of insect vector borne diseases. Research is currently focusing on vector/parasite interactions, specifically those between Plasmodium and Anopheles mosquitoes, in order to discover novel, improved malaria prevention methods. TEP1 is being explored as a possible target for genetic manipulation. A significant aim of this research is to create mosquito populations resistant to Plasmodium parasites therefore reducing the spread of malaria.

Golden Nugget Lake Charles is the fifth Golden Nugget property, joining the original location in Downtown Las Vegas, and others in Laughlin, Nevada; Atlantic City, New Jersey and Biloxi, Mississippi.  History  Pinnacle Entertainment announced plans in 2006 to build Sugarcane Bay, a $350-million casino resort, next to its L'Auberge du Lac casino in Lake Charles. The plan was canceled in 2010, and Pinnacle returned the gaming license to the state. In February 2011, the license was awarded to Creative Casinos LLC, the company of former Pinnacle chairman Dan Lee, for a $400-million casino named Mojito Pointe to be built on the Sugarcane Bay site. Ameristar Casinos purchased Creative Casinos in June 2012 for $32.5 million, after Lee had difficulty financing construction. The project was renamed as Ameristar Lake Charles. In December 2012, Pinnacle agreed to acquire Ameristar. In order to obtain approval for the merger from FTC antitrust regulators, Pinnacle agreed to the sale of two of the combined company's properties, including Ameristar Lake Charles. A sale agreement was reached with Landry's, Inc., parent company of the Golden Nugget casinos, who agreed to pay the costs expended on the project's development to date. Landry's owner Tilman J. Fertitta announced improvements and upgrades to the property, investing more than $600 million in the project, one of the most expensive construction endeavors in the United States at the time. In December 2013, construction topped out on the 25-story accommodations tower. Located just two hours from Houston, Fertitta had long desired a casino-resort near the headquarters of Landry's, Inc.

Because the law only delayed and did not repeal the physician payment cut, it was a source of controversy. The bill was signed into law on April 1, 2014, during the 113th United States Congress. Background In the United States, Medicare is a national social insurance program, administered by the U.S. federal government since 1966, that guarantees access to health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system, younger people with disabilities, and a few other groups. As a social insurance program, Medicare spreads the financial risk associated with illness across society to protect everyone, and thus has a somewhat different social role from for-profit private insurers, which manage their risk portfolio by adjusting their pricing according to perceived risk. In 2010, Medicare provided health insurance to 48 million Americans‚Äî40 million people age 65 and older and eight million younger people with disabilities. It was the primary payer for an estimated 15.3 million inpatient stays in 2011, representing 47.2 percent ($182.7 billion) of total aggregate inpatient hospital costs in the United States.Torio CM, Andrews RM. National Inpatient Hospital Costs: The Most Expensive Conditions by Payer, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #160. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. August 2013. On average, Medicare covers about half (48 percent) of health care costs for enrollees. Medicare enrollees must cover the rest of the cost. These out-of-pocket costs vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs. They might include uncovered services‚Äîsuch as long- term, dental, hearing, and vision care‚Äîand supplemental insurance.Kaiser Slides  The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Facts.kff.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-17. A formula, called the \\"Sustainable Growth Rate\\" (SGR) formula, was established in 1997 to make planned cuts to Medicare reimbursement rates. Congress has regularly avoided making these cuts since then by passing legislation, colloquially known as the \\"doc fix\\", to delay the cuts. Congress has been making these temporary changes for over a decade. On March 14, 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015; 113th Congress), a bill that would have replaced the SGR formula, which determines the annual updates to payment rates for physicians‚Äô services in Medicare, with new systems for establishing those payment rates. However, the bill would pay for these changes by delaying the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate requirement, a provision that was very unpopular with Democrats. Provisions of the bill The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 would delay until March 2015 any cuts in the Medicare reimbursement rate. Without this or similar legislation, a 24 percent cut would go into effect on April 1, 2014. This delay in cuts is predominantly paid for through other more targeted Medicare cuts to skilled nursing facilities, lab tests, overvalued physician services, and other providers. However, one-fifth of the delay is not paid for, and merely uses an accounting trick to move Medicare sequester cuts from 2025 to 2024 in order to give the appearance of balancing out. In order to accomplish this, the bill includes a provision that makes it exempt from pay-as-you-go \\"rules that require new spending to be offset with new revenues or cuts.\\" Procedural history The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 26, 2014 by Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Budget, the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, and the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The bill was passed on March 27, 2014, through a controversial voice vote. The Senate voted on March 31, 2014, to pass the bill 64-35 in Roll Call Vote 93. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on April 1, 2014, when it became . Debate and discussion Critics of the bill have objected to the fact that there are not enough offsets to balance the increased spending. Ed Lorenzen of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget argued that the \\"sequester realignment provision is a pure timing gimmick that produces no real savings and has no effect on the debt.\\" The American Medical Association (AMA) also opposed this bill because it wanted a solution that would be long-term, instead of yet another one-year delay. The AMA had supported the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015; 113th Congress), instead of this bill. AMA president Ardis Dee Hoven argued strongly in favor of the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014, calling the current SGR \\"fiscally foolish\\" and \\"fatally-flawed.\\" A coalition of medical groups wrote that \\"instead of reforming the Medicare physician system, Congress seems intent on imposing yet another round of arbitrary provider payment reductions to maintain a corrosive policy that essentially every member of Congress says should be scrapped.\\" A key addition to this bill not supported by CMS or HHS is Section 212. This section mandates that The HHS secretary will be blocked from implementing the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10-CM/PCS) until 10/1/2015 at the earliest. Previously ICD-10 had been delayed from 10/1/13 to 10/1/14. On 2/28/14 CMS confirmed no further delays of ICD-10 would occur. The United States is the only developed nation that is still using the ICD-9 code set which was implemented in the 1970s. This delay not only slows the advancement of Healthcare modernization it negatively impacts patient care, safety, and clinical research of public health data that was set to be implemented 10/1/14. AHIMA estimates this delay will cost upwards of 6 Billion Dollars and stifle advancement in Healthcare infrastructure, technology, and practice. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) opposed the bill because \\"I simply cannot support yet another temporary SGR patch\\" and thought that the bill \\"sets back months and months of hard work.\\" The House Doctor's Caucus opposed the bill. House Democrats complained that the bill was released too closely to the deadline for passage, preventing anyone from fully understanding its contents. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that she supported the bill because she thought Republicans would use the situation, if the Medicare cuts went into effect, to attack Obamacare and because she didn't want seniors to worry about their access to their doctors. Sponsor of the bill Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA) said he still supports a permanent fix and is \\"sponsoring this bill today because it is my earnest hope that this is the last patch we will have to pass.\\" =Voice vote controversy= The bill was originally scheduled to be considered under a suspension of the rules, a procedure that would have required the bill to receive a two-thirds majority to pass. However, when it became clear to the Republican leadership that they did not have enough votes to win a two-thirds majority, they changed the vote to a voice vote instead, scheduling that vote to take place when the House chamber was nearly empty. Opponents of the bill, unaware of this change, were not present to object to the voice vote and force a roll call instead. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) called the vote \\"bullshit\\" and told reporters that he could not talk about \\"the budget because I am so pissed about the (doc fix).\\" Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) said that, while he did not like the tactic used to get the bill passed, he did think the bill was better than the scheduled sharp reimbursement rate decrease. Fleming said that \\"they gave us a choice between something bad and something worse.\\" Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) wrote on Twitter, \\"Short on votes for controversial spending bill, so GOP & Dem leaders rammed it through by 'voice vote' in empty House chamber. Not right.\\" Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) called the tactic \\"outrageous\\" and said that \\"now I know that I need to get with some other members and make sure we have people on the floor, since we won't be sure what our own leadership is going to do.\\" The House Democratic leadership reportedly agreed to this quick change to a voice vote in advance. Pressure from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) may have been involved in this decision, since the Senate needed a doc fix bill quickly in order to get one passed before the deadline. Many democratic supporters are disappointed in Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) who pushed House Democrats to a Voice Vote without additional debate or time necessary to submit amendments. Some members found the tactic amusing. Rep. John Dingell (D-MI), the longest serving member of the House, told reporters \\"I've seen a lot of dumb things, but I've never seen anything as comical as this.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4302 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4302 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4302 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 4302 *Congressional Budget Office's Cost Estimate on H.R. 4302 Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014"},{"id":"42325664","text":"Wolfgang Kirchg√§ssner (1 June 1928 ‚Äì 26 March 2014) was a Roman Catholic bishop.

It ‚Äúaddressed only the availability of civil remedies for business violations in cases of penalty, forfeiture, and criminal violation.‚ÄùCalifornia Antitrust & Unfair Competition Law, supra note 2, at 4. A 1933 amendment expanded the law to prohibit ‚Äúany person [from] performing an act of unfair competition.‚ÄùCal. Stat. 1933 ch. 953, ¬ß 1, p. 2482. This amendment did not, however, extend UCL protection to consumers. This limitation was in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1931 decision in FTC v. Raladam.FTC v. Raladam, 283 U.S. 643 (1931). In Raladam, the Court held that a FTC Act Section 5 violation must show actual injury to competition.Id. at 647-49. This ruling prevented individual consumers from suing under the FTC Act.See id. Following this rationale, California applied the UCL to unfair business practices that affected business competitors, not consumers. In 1935, consumers, not just business competitors, were given the opportunity to sue under the UCL.California Antitrust & Unfair Competition Law, supra note 2, at 5. The Supreme Court of California clarified the statute in American Philatelic Soc. v. Claibourne, stating that ‚Äúthe rules of unfair competition‚Äù should protect the public from ‚Äúfraud and deceit.‚Äù American Philatelic Soc. v. Claibourne, 3 Cal.2d 689, 698 (1935). In 1962, a California appellate court reiterated this rule by stating that the UCL extended ‚Äúequitable relief to situations beyond the scope of purely business competition.‚Äù People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co., 201 Cal. App. 2d 765, 770 (1962). In 1977, the legislature moved the UCL to the California Business and Professions Code ¬ß 17200.Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 17 Cal. 4th 553, 570 (1998). In 2004, California voters enacted Proposition 64, which limited UCL standing to individuals who suffered financial/property loss because of an unfair business practice.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17203 (2010). Section 17200 standing to sue The UCL confers standing on both private parties and public prosecutors.Id. Section 17204 authorizes the Attorney General, district attorneys, county counsels and city attorneys to file lawsuits on behalf of injured citizens. Prior to Proposition 64, any consumer, regardless of whether they were adversely affected by unfair business acts, could bring a UCL action.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17204 (2003). In addition, any consumer could act as a representative and file a class action lawsuit against a business committing unfair competition.Id. ¬ß 17203 (2003). Proposition 64 allows only private plaintiffs who have ‚Äúsuffered injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition‚Äù may file suit,Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17204 (2010). while ‚Äúunaffected‚Äù plaintiffs now lack standing. Furthermore, the California Supreme Court expanded this amendment to class actions in Arias v. Superior Court by holding that ‚Äúunaffected‚Äù plaintiffs no longer may bring a class action lawsuit unless they satisfy the regular requirements laid out in Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 382.Arias v. Superior Court, 46 Cal. 4th 969, 980 (2009). The requirement does not apply to all class members, however; only class representatives must meet these requirements.In re Tobacco II Cases, 46 Cal.4th 298, 315-17 (2009). Overview of the UCL California's UCL is broadly written.Flamingo Industries (USA) Ltd. v. United States Postal Service, (9th Cir. 2002) 302 F.3d 985 (9th Cir. 2002), rev'd on other grounds in, United States Postal Service v. Flamingo Industries (USA) Ltd., 540 U.S. 736 (2004). Section 17200 includes five definitions of unfair competition: (1) an unlawful business act or practice; (2) an unfair business act or practice; (3) a fraudulent business act or practice; (4) unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising; or (5) any act prohibited by Sections 17500-17577.5.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17200 (2010). Section 17203 allows the court to order injunctions and other equitable defenses to prevent the unfair competition.Id. ¬ß 17203. Elements of a false advertising claim Most false advertising litigation involves definitions four and five listed above because they both specifically prohibit false advertising.California Antitrust & Unfair Competition Law, supra note 2, at 27. To prove a violation under the fourth definition of unfair competition, the plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant engaged in unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and (2) the plaintiff suffered injury in fact and lost money or property.Buckland v. Threshold Enterprises, Ltd., 155 Cal. App. 4th 798, 819, (2007). California courts have interpreted ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù to include almost any statement made in connection with the sale of goods or services.See Chern v. Bank of America, 15 Cal.3d 866, 875-76 (1976). For example, Chern v. Bank of America held that a loan officer's statement over the phone about interest rates was ‚Äúadvertising.‚Äù Conversely, Bank of the West v. Superior Court implied that advertising might require ‚Äúwidespread promotional activities directed to the public-at-large‚Äù and that mere ‚Äúpersonal solicitations are not advertising.‚ÄùBank of the West v. Superior Court, 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1276-1277 fn.9 (1992). To determine whether advertising is misleading, California's courts evaluate the advertisement's entire impression, including words, images, format and product packaging.Committee on Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp., 35 Cal. 3d 197, 210 (1983). Courts have held that advertising is misleading if ‚Äúmembers of the public are likely to be deceived.‚ÄùId. at 211. However, because of Proposition 64, the plaintiff now has to show that they were actually misled by the advertising and suffered an injury as a result. To further complicate matters, the courts are split on whether ‚Äúomissions of material facts‚Äù that mislead or confuse the public violate the UCL.Kasky v. Nike, Inc., 27 Cal.4th 939, 951 (2002). To prove a violation under the fifth definition, the plaintiff must show that section 17500 was violated.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17200. This ‚Äúsweep up‚Äù provision ensures that any acts mentioned in section 17500 also violate section 17200 and that the plaintiff receives remedies under both statutes.See California Antitrust & Unfair Competition Law, supra note 2, at 60-62. In many cases, liquidators which are hired to sell merchandise from a closing store will actually raise the prices on items that were already marked-down on clearance. For items already marked-down to 50% off, this means the liquidator is doubling the price (quadrupling it for a 75%-off price), and then \\"discounting\\" it from there. Also common is for the sale prices at a retail chain's other stores to be lower than the liquidator's prices at the closing stores. Both of these were proven to be the case in November 2008, with the same liquidator (Hilco) committing both offenses: the markups at Linens 'n Things, and the higher prices on around one-third of the items compared to other Circuit City stores remaining open. Additionally, liquidators refuse to accept returns, so if a customer does find he or she has been overcharged, there is no apparent recourse. This is used by most advertisers trying to prove the acceptability of their products. Relationship between section 17200 and other California consumer protection statutes Most plaintiffs allege violations of section 17200 and 17500 concurrently. In fact, courts often do not distinguish between these definitions of unfair competition, despite important differences between these two sections. A violation of section 17200 may not always trigger a violation of 17500. Section 17500 prohibits any untrue or misleading statements made in connection with the sale of goods or services, which is narrower standard than section 17200.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17500. For example, section 17500 only concerns advertising of property or services while section 17200 has no such limitation. Section 17500 only prohibits advertising, but section 17200 also forbids ‚Äúfraudulent business acts or practices‚Äù unconnected with advertising.See id ¬ß 17200. Another major distinction is that section 17500 requires that the advertiser knew or should have known that the advertising was false or misleading. Section 17200 is a strict liability statute that has no such requirement.South Bay Chevrolet v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 72 Cal.App.4th 861, 877 (1999). In addition, section 17500 carries criminal penalties, whereas only civil remedies are available for section 17200 violations. Plaintiffs suing under Sections 17200 or 17500 often also assert violations of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), set forth in Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 1750 et seq.Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 1750 ¬ß1770 et seq. The CLRA protects consumers against 23 specific activities that it defines as unfair and deceptive business practices.Hogya v. Superior Court, 75 Cal. App. 3d 122, 135 (1977); Wang v. Massey Chevrolet, 97 Cal. App. 4th 856 (2002). Many of those activities are also prohibited by section 17500 and Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß1770.Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 1770. For example, it is unlawful under both statutes to advertise goods with the intent not to sell them as advertised or to misrepresent a product's price or source.Id. ¬ß 1780(2),(9), & (20); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17500. Plaintiffs typically simultaneously plead violations of each statute because the remedies are cumulative. For example, the CLRA provides for attorney's fees, punitive damages, and statutory damages.Cal. Civ. Code ¬ß 1780. Exemptions and defenses The UCL requires that lawsuits be brought within four years after the cause of action accrued.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17208. The UCL postpones accrual of the cause of action until the plaintiff ‚Äúdiscovers‚Äù the problem.Glue-Fold, Inc. v. Slautterback Corp., 82 Cal. App. 4th. 1018, 1029 (2000). Section 17500 does not have an express statute of limitations.See Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß¬ß 17500-17577.5 Thus, California Code of Civil Procedure section 338(h), which specifies a three-year limitation, ordinarily should apply to section 17500. However, as section 17500 is cross referenced in section 17200, and as virtually all false advertising claims are litigated simultaneously with UCL claims, the limitations period for ‚Äúfalse advertising claims is effectively four-years.‚Äù See California Antitrust & Unfair Competition Law, supra note 2, at 72. Judges can use their equitable powers to dismiss a UCL claim or deny injunctive relief.Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Product Co., 23 Cal.4th 163, 179 (2000). For example, in competitor-vs.-competitor lawsuits, the defendant may assert unclean hands if it believes the plaintiff has engaged in serious misconduct that relates to the subject of relief being sought. In other words, a ‚Äúplaintiff must not behave inequitably with respect to the rights being asserted in the case.‚Äù WILLIAM M. TABB & ELAINE W. SHOBEN, REMEDIES 52 (Thomson West 2005). Because the UCL is a strict liability statute, other equitable defenses such as ‚Äúgood faith, mistake of law and lack of wrongful intent are generally inapplicable [to] a UCL action.‚Äù Id. at 50. Remedies available under the UCL The UCL allows the court to prevent the use of unfair competition and to restore money or property to victims of unfair competition.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17203. Essentially, this provision allows for both monetary damages and injunctive relief where necessary. When an injunction is issued pursuant to section 17200, penalties of up to $6,000 per day for intentional violations are authorized.Id. ¬ß 17207. Restitution and disgorgement of profits are used primarily to deter future violations.California Antitrust & Unfair Competition Law, supra note 2, at 32-33; Bank of the West, 2 Cal.4th at 1266-67. Courts use various factors to determine the amount of the penalty, including ‚Äúthe nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant's misconduct, and the defendant's assets, liabilities, and net worth.‚Äù Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 17206(b). Civil penalties, up to $2,500 for each violation, are allowed when a lawsuit is brought by an authorized government agency. However, the UCL does not permit punitive damages awards.

Their natural opponents are the peri, a fairy-like spirit originated from Iranian tradition. Some of them use primitive types of weapons such as stones, while others appear as warriors with armors and weapons. In addition to their physical strength, some of them are masters of sorcery, overcoming their enemies with magic.  Origin  Dev probably originate from Avestan daeva, evil spirits created by the principle of evil in Zorastrianism, Ahriman. During the Islamic period, the idea of daeva changed to the notion of dev; monstrous creatures in physical shape, with long teeth and claws, often compared to Western ogre. The first translations of the Quran into Persian language seem to have transliterated the Quranic evil jinn as dev, leading to some confusions of both distinct types of creatures. Later they have been adapted by many cultures among the Islamic Ottoman Empire.  Islam  \`Aliquli - King Solomon and Two Demons - Walters W62494B - Full Page angel or a peri = Exegesis = According to Tabari, the malicious devs are part of a long chain of pre-adamic creatures, preceding the benevolent peris, whom they fight a constant battle. However, not all exegetes agree with that. The Islamic philosopher Al-Razi conjectured that the devs are souls of the wicked dead, turned into dev after their death. = Folklore = In Persian folklore, devs are supposed to look like horned men, with animal heads and hooves. Some take the form of a snake or a dragon with multiple heads.Reza Yousefvand Demonology & worship of Dives in Iranian local legend Assistant Professor, Payam Noor University, Department of history, Tehran. Iran Life Science Journal 2019 However, as shapeshifters, they can take almost every other form too. They are feared during night, the time when they are awake, since it is said that darkness increases their power. Ghulam Husayn Sa‚Äôidi's Ahl-i Hava (people of the air), discussing several folkloric beliefs about different types of supernatural creatures, describes them as tall creatures living on islands or in the desert and can turn people into statues by touching them.Pedram Khosronejad THE PEOPLE OF THE AIR HEALING AND SPIRIT POSSESSION IN SOUTH OF IRAN In: Shamanism and Healing Rituals in Contemporary Islam and Sufism, T.Zarcone (ed.) 2011, I.B.Tauris  Armenian mythology  In Armenian mythology and many various Armenian folk tales, the dev (in Armenian: ’§÷á) appears both in a kind and specially in a malicious role, and has a semi- divine origin. Dev is a very large being with an immense head on his shoulders, and with eyes as large as earthen bowls. Some of them may have only one eye. Usually, there are Black and White Devs. However, both of them can either be malicious or kind. The White Dev is present in Hovhannes Tumanyan's tale \\"Yedemakan Tzaghike\\" (Arm.: ‘µ’§’•’¥’°’Ø’°’∂ ‘æ’°’≤’´’Ø’®), translated as \\"The Flower of Paradise\\". In the tale, the Dev is the flower's guardian.

Persian mythology Turkish Siyah Qalam depiction of dancing devs According to the Islamic legends of Persia, the dev have been entrusted to govern the earth 70,000 years before the creation of Adam, until they had been superseded by peri and jinn ruled by Jann ibn Jann. However, when Jann ibn Jann offended heaven, an army of angels led by Iblis came down to earth, commanded by God to overthrow him. Iblis succeeded with the aid of some traitorous dev. When God created the first human, Iblis and his rebellious angels refused to do homage and joined the jinn and dev, he just defeated before. His immediate followers were sent to the infernal regions of the underworld, while the rest of them were allowed to wander the earth as constant source of misery and suffering. Both Arabs and Persians located their new capital in Mount Kaf, the city of Aherman-Bad, named after Ahriman, who became their current king.

ERIL (Entity-Relationship and Inheritance Language) is a visual language for representing the data structure of a computer system. As its name suggests, ERIL is based on entity-relationship diagrams and class diagrams. ERIL combines the relational and object-oriented approaches to data modeling.  Overview  ERIL can be seen as a set of guidelines aimed at improving the readability of structure diagrams. These guidelines were borrowed from DRAKON, a variant of flowcharts created within the Russian space program. ERIL itself was developed by Stepan Mitkin. The ERIL guidelines for drawing diagrams: * Lines must be straight, either strictly vertical or horizontal. * Vertical lines mean ownership (composition). * Horizontal lines mean peer relationships (aggregation). * Line intersections are not allowed. * It is not recommended to fit the whole data model on a single diagram. Draw many simple diagrams instead. * The same class (table) can appear several times on the same diagram. * Use the following standard symbols to indicate the type of the relationship. ** One-to-one: a simple line. ** One-to-many, two-way: a line with a \\"paw\\". ** One-to-many, one-way: an arrow. ** Many-to-many: a line with two \\"paws\\". * Do not lump together inheritance and data relationships.ERIL: a Visual Language for Data Modelling  Indexes  A class (table) in ERIL can have several indexes. Each index in ERIL can include one or more fields, similar to indexes in relational databases. ERIL indexes are logical. They can optionally be implemented by real data structures.  Links  Links between classes (tables) in ERIL are implemented by the so-called \\"link\\" fields. Link fields can be of different types according to the link type: * reference; * collection of references. Example: there is a one-to-many link between Documents and Lines. One Document can have many Lines. Then the Document.Lines field is a collection of references to the lines that belong to the document. Line.Document is a reference to the document that contains the line. Link fields are also logical. They may or may not be implemented physically in the system.  Usage  ERIL is supposed to model any kind of data regardless of the storage. The same ERIL diagram can represent data stored in a relational database, in a NoSQL database, XML file or in the memory. ERIL diagrams serve two purposes. The primary purpose is to explain the data structure of an existing or future system or component. The secondary purpose is to automatically generate source code from the model. Code that can be generated includes specialized collection classes, hash and comparison functions, data retrieval and modification procedures, SQL data-definition code, etc. Code generated from ERIL diagrams can ensure referential and uniqueness data integrity. Serialization code of different kinds can also be automatically generated. In some ways ERIL can be compared to object-relational mapping frameworks.

Following training with Vincent du Vigneaud at Cornell University, she spent most of her career at Yale University. After decades as a researcher and then associate professor there, Simmonds became a full professor of biochemistry in 1975, and later served as Associate Dean of Yale College. With her husband Joseph Fruton, Simmonds coauthored the influential General Biochemistry, the first comprehensive biochemistry textbook. Simmonds received the American Chemical Society's Garvan Medal in 1969. Youth, education, and early career Sofia, who went by the childhood nickname \\"Topsy\\" throughout her life, was the second child of Lionel Julius Simmonds and Clara Gottfried Simmonds. She was raised in Manhattan, where her father was the superintendent of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum. After graduating high school, she met biochemistry graduate student Joseph Fruton in 1933; the two began courting and they married in 1936. After high school and several months as a laboratory assistant at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons (where Fruton was earning his PhD), Simmonds attended Barnard College, where she earned a BA in chemistry in 1938. After that, she started graduate work in the lab of Hans Thacher Clarke (who had been Fruton's advisor), but soon transferred to Cornell Medical College to work under Vincent du Vigneaud. She worked in Vigneaud's laboratory on the study of transmethylation, completing her PhD in biochemistry in 1942 and continuing as a research associate until she and Fruton moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1945. Yale In 1945, Fruton and Simmonds began working at Yale: Fruton as an associate professor and Simmonds as an instructor of physiological chemistry. The next year, Simmonds joined the Yale laboratory of Edward Tatum. Opportunities for career advancement for women scientists were very limited at the time, and discrimination (often in the form of anti-nepotism rules) prevented the advancement of women scientists who worked in the same field as their husbands, as Simmonds did. Fruton became a full professor in 1950, and subsequently became chairman of his department; Simmonds only became associate professor by 1959, and she was initially denied promotion to full professorship in 1966, only reaching that rank in 1975, nearly 30 years after starting at Yale. In his memoir Eighty Years, Fruton recounts that the \\"delay had adverse effect on Topsy's personal research, but the recognition of the merits of her scientific work and the quality of her contributions as a teacher could no longer be denied\\" by then. Fruton and Simmonds remained at Yale in the 1950s, when Fruton had the opportunity to join departments at other universities, in part because Simmonds‚Äîas a woman and the wife of a senior scientist‚Äîwould have had even fewer opportunities for an independent career elsewhere. In 1969, after being nominated by Edward Tatum, Simmonds received the Garvan Medal of the American Chemical Society, which recognizes contributions to chemistry by women scientists.

It was finished in 1915 and was published as a set in the winter of 1917.  Composition  Stravinsky's Three Easy Pieces can be understood as an example of Gebrauchsmusik, that is, music that was conceived and composed specifically for some purpose, and not for its own sake. In this case, Stravinsky wrote this set and 1917 Five Easy Pieces especially for educational purposes. After completing his Valse des fleurs, which is similar to them in the sense that they were composed for his little children to play with him, Stravinsky decided to write pieces for four hands to teach them how to play the piano. The set was composed in Clarens, in 1914 and 1915 and was presented and first performed by Jos√© Iturbi, on April 22, 1918. It was eventually published in 1917.  Analysis  The Three Easy Pieces take approximately three minutes to perform. The pieces are: Even though they are titled as \\"easy\\", only the left part is easy, the right hand sustaining the whole burden of the composition. In this case, the secondo has only one staff and uses both hands to play ostinato parts. The set features an overtly satirical character, in contrast to its twin set, which is much more serious and displays much more insight into Stravinsky's compositional method. Stravinsky once referred to them as \\"popcorn\\".  Arrangements  Stravinsky himself made a number of arrangements of these three pieces. Upon completing the set in 1915, Stravinsky made a first transcription of the Polka for cimbalom and for cimbalom and a small ensemble. Later that year, he also arranged the March for twelve instruments and the Waltz for seven instruments. However, only the solo cimbalom version of the Polka was selected for publication. In 1921, Stravinsky reworked the three movements and arranged them for small orchestra, and published them as the first three movements in Suite No. 2.

Each house was divided so that men and women did most things separately. They used different staircases and doors. They sat on opposite sides of the room in worship, at meals, and in \\"union meetings\\" held to provide supervised socialization between the sexes.

The debate centers on whether or not the last two remnants of the virus known to cause smallpox, which are kept in tightly controlled government laboratories in the United States and Russia, should finally and irreversibly be destroyed. Advocates of final destruction maintain that there is no longer any valid rationale for retaining the samples, which pose the hazard of escaping the laboratories, while opponents of destruction maintain that the samples may still be of value to scientific research, especially since variants of the smallpox virus may still exist in the natural world and thus present the possibility of the disease re-emerging in the future and/or being used as a bio-weapon. Background The last cases of smallpox occurred in an outbreak of two cases, one of which was fatal, in Birmingham, United Kingdom, in 1978. A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on September 11, 1978. In light of this incident, all known stocks of the smallpox virus were destroyed or transferred to one of two World Health Organization reference laboratories which had BSL-4 facilities‚Äîthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Russia. Since 1984, these two labs have been the only ones authorized by the WHO to hold stocks of live smallpox virus. In 1986, the WHO first recommended destruction of all Smallpox samples, and later set the date of destruction to be 30 December 1993. This was postponed to 30 June 1999, then again to 30 June 2002. Due to resistance from the U.S. and Russia, in 2002 the World Health Assembly agreed to permit temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes. Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research; the stocks are not needed to respond to a smallpox outbreak. Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests. A 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by the WHO, however, concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the American and Russian laboratories continuing to retain live virus stocks.Comments on the Scientific Review of Variola Virus Research, 1999‚Äê2010. Advisory Group of Independent Experts to review the smallpox research program (AGIES) WHO document WHO/HSE/GAR/BDP/2010.4 The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community, particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program (1958‚Äì79). Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Infections An Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Infections, advising the WHO, has debated the fate of the remaining samples of smallpox in the remaining two official repositories since 1980. Smallpox expert D. A. Henderson has been foremost in favor of destruction, while U.S. Army scientist Peter Jahrling has argued against it on the basis that further research is needed, since he believes that smallpox almost certainly exists outside of the repositories.Preston, Richard (2002), The Demon in the Freezer. Other scientists have expressed similar opinions. U.S. pro-retention argument (2011) In 2011, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, laid out the rationale of the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama in a New York Times op-ed piece. She said, in part: > [In 1980], the WHO called on all nations to destroy their collections of > smallpox virus or transfer them to the WHO-sanctioned collections at one of > two labs in Russia or the United States. The global public health community > assumes that all nations acted in good faith; however, no one has ever > attempted to verify or validate compliance with the WHO request‚Ä¶. Although > keeping the samples may carry a minuscule risk, both the United States and > Russia believe the dangers of destroying them now are far greater‚Ä¶. It is > quite possible that undisclosed or forgotten stocks exist. Also, 30 years > after the disease was eradicated, the virus‚Äô genomic information is > available online and the technology now exists for someone with the right > tools and the wrong intentions to create a new smallpox virus in a > laboratory‚Ä¶.

Destruction of the last securely stored viruses is an > irrevocable action that should occur only when the global community has > eliminated the threat of smallpox once and for all.

Post-1984 instances discovery *In 2013, cloned variola major (smallpox) DNA fragments were found in a South African laboratory. The WHO arranged to oversee their destruction, which took place in January 2014. *On July 1, 2014, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) notified the regulatory agency, the Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that employees had discovered vials labeled \\"variola\\" in an unused portion of a storage room in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laboratory located on the NIH Bethesda campus. An investigation is ongoing.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ‚ÄúCDC Media Statement on Newly Discovered Smallpox Specimens‚Äù (July 8, 2014). A media statement was released by the CDC regarding the Bethesda variola major situation seven days after the discovery. It confirmed that variola major had been found and it had been transferred to a BSL-4 laboratory at the CDC in Atlanta. Overnight PCR testing had shown the vials did contain variola major. The vials were believed to have been from the 1950s. Further testing showed that the vials contained viable (live) variola major virus. As of the end of 2014, the vials were placed in a secure freezer to await destruction. The protocol for destruction of variola major virus involves a member of the WHO being present at the destruction. Usually the observer watches via closed- circuit television outside the room where the variola virus is autoclaved to destroy it. As a result of the Ebola outbreak in parts of Africa around the same time, the WHO were overstretched and stated they had no one locally with sufficient security clearance to enter a BSL-4 laboratory. Due to this the WHO were planning to fly an official into Atlanta to oversee the destruction at a future date. The vials were finally destroyed on February 24, 2015, under the supervision of WHO officials. WHO 2018 position As of May 2018, based on the latest (19th) meeting of the WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research (1‚Äì2 November 2017), the question remained as to whether the use of live variola virus for their further development was \\"essential for public health\\". 2019 Lab Explosion In September 2019, the Russian lab housing smallpox samples experienced a gas explosion that injured one worker. It did not occur near the virus storage area, and no samples were compromised, but the incident prompted a review of risks to containment.Russian Lab Explosion Raises Question: Should Smallpox Virus Be Kept Or Destroyed?

Episode summary The human eye was used as a device to explain evolution to the audience. The episode covers several facets of the origin of life and evolution. Tyson describes both artificial selection via selective breeding, using the example of mankind's domestication of wolves into dogs, and natural selection that created species like polar bears. Tyson uses the Ship of the Imagination to show how DNA, genes, and mutation work, and how these led to the diversity of species as represented by the Tree of Life, including how complex organs such as the eye came about as a common element. Tyson describes extinction of species and the five great extinction events that wiped out numerous species on Earth, while some species, such as the tardigrade, were able to survive and continue life. Tyson speculates on the possibility of life on other planets, such as Saturn's moon, Titan, as well as how abiogenesis may have originated life on Earth. The episode concludes with an animation from the original Cosmos showing the evolution of life from a single cell to mankind today, with music from Vivaldi's Mandolin Concerto.

Regina Rodgers, wife of Frederick Rodgers, continued to operate several stores after his death.

Like Civilization V, the game is played on a hex map. Players control a barbarian tribe, and their aim is to accelerate the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The map changes with the seasons, and resources are gradually depleted, forcing the players to migrate their tribe. After realizing he missed being able to work on a video game instead of managing its production, Shafer first announced At the Gates in 2013, after stepping away from former employer Stardock. The game was partially funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising $106,283 in March of that year. Originally scheduled for release in June 2014, the game was still unfinished even as Shafer began working for Paradox Interactive full-time in May 2017, with development continuing in Shafer's spare time. Conifer Games released At the Gates on January 23, 2019, after spending seven years in development.  Development  Before his work on At the Gates, Shafer was employed at Stardock. He first helped the company redesign Elemental: War of Magic, after its initial 2010 release received poor reviews. After releasing the remake, Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, in 2012, Shafer received an opportunity to helm his own project. However, he realized during its development that managing the project wasn't nearly as enjoyable to him as making the game itself, stating, \\"it snowballs into this big chain of pain. You're trying to end up with something good, and it's hard\\". In 2013, Shafer announced that he had left Stardock to form his own company, Conifer Games. He also reported that At the Gates would be Conifer Games' first title, which would be scheduled for release in June 2014. After announcing the project on crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, the game successfully raised $106,283 in funds towards its development in March 2013. Joining Shafer to work on the project was artist Kay Fedewa and programmer Jonathan Christ. Like Shafer, Fedewa and Christ were unpaid, but Shafer was the only one working full-time on the project. Initially, At the Gates began as a \\"prototype of ideas\\" that Shafer wanted to try, such as cyclical map changes in the form of seasons. He also wanted to use his new game as an opportunity to improve on the work he did for Civilization V, criticizing his previous attempt at AI design, as well as his decision to let map tiles be occupied by only one character unit at a time. Work on the game had already begun a year before Shafer first announced the project. Alpha testing began in October 2013, with Shafer setting a revised target release date of 2015, stating, \\"the goal with [At the Gates] is not just to make a strategy game that not only breaks new ground but also one that is polished at release\\". Inspired by other games like Crusader Kings, Shafer began adding more features to At the Gates beyond its original scope, significantly extending development time. This led to him struggling with balancing work and his personal life, ultimately causing him to stop posting updates on Kickstarter. Describing this period, Shafer noted: > I was in a situation where everything had fallen apart. I hadn‚Äôt worked on > the game in a while. I wasn‚Äôt [answering] emails or paying bills or talking > to people or anything. Everything just completely shut down. As the game became increasingly delayed, Shafer took on a position at Paradox Interactive in May 2017, opting to split time between developing At the Gates and working for Paradox. However, it was announced after six months that he would be leaving the studio over creative differences. After seven years of development, At the Gates was released on January 23, 2019.

The bank specialised in corporate finance advice. In 2012 the firm moved its headquarters to London.. Quayle Munro was acquired by Houlihan Lokey in January 2018. History The company was founded by Ian Quayle Jones and Michael Munro. Jones had previously been an executive director of the British Linen Bank and Munro a director of East of Scotland Investment Managers. The company was set up to provide 'professional financial services to industrial and commercial companies, particularly those operating in Scotland and the North of England'. The company office was at 42 Charlotte Square and the first chairman was Sir Alan Smith. In the 1980s, the company was involved in Dawson International's ¬£650 million bid for Coats PLC and the ¬£135 million full placing and listing of Shanks Group. Quayle Munro also assisted the Scottish Office with the privatisation of ScotRail and the Scottish Bus Group, the disposal of Scottish Enterprise's investment portfolio, the funding arrangements for the Skye Bridge and were advisers on the options regarding privatisation of water facilities in Scotland. The Skye bridge deal was the first private finance initiative (PFI) deal in the United Kingdom. Quayle Munro became the preferred adviser for the majority of PFI deals in Scotland until the introduction of the Scottish Futures Trust in 2008. In March 1993, the bank announced that it would be making a reverse takeover of East of Scotland Industrial Investments. The new company would be called Quayle Munro Holdings and would seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange. In June 1993, Quayle Munros shares' commenced trading on the Stock Exchange. In 2003, Quayle Munro, moved its listing from the main stock market to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Ian Jones, chairman, stated that 'the AIM did not exist in 1993 and was now more appropriate for the company's structure'. In July 2007, Quayle Munro acquired New Boathouse Capital in London for ¬£7.5 million, to expand its corporate finance business. The bank also bought London based, Van Tulleken, a corporate advisory firm specialising in media and information technology in April 2008. In July 2012, the bank moved its headquarters to London, to focus on its corporate finance business. The project finance business based in Edinburgh was sold to senior management in September 2012, with Quayle Munro Holdings retaining a 30% share in the new company, Quayle Munro Project Finance. In July 2013, Quayle Munro Holdings announced that it would be delisting from the Stock Exchange to become a private firm. The move was designed to simplify the company's structure and streamline costs. In January 2018, Quayle Munro was acquired by Houlihan Lokey.

This process relies on the key interaction between the integrin Œ±4Œ≤7 and the addressin MadCAM-1 on the surfaces of the appropriate cells. Additionally, this interaction is strengthened by the presence of CCR9, a chemokine receptor, which interacts with TECK. Vitamin A-derived retinoic acid regulates the expression of these cell surface proteins. T cell summary T cell image T cells are produced in the thymus, and upon leaving they migrate to and around the lymphoid organs of the body, including lymph nodes. In the paracortex of the lymphoid nodes they are exposed to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs). Specific interactions between the na√Øve T cells and their cognate antigens result in T cell activation. The activated T cells, immunoblasts, undergo clonal expansion before acquiring effector functions. The activated T cells then emigrate from the lymph nodes, via the efferent lymphatic vessel, and migrate around the body in the blood. In certain circumstances, some activated T cells show a preference for patrolling certain tissues. This has been termed lymphocyte homing. Gut-specific homing is the preferential movement of activated T cells to the intestine and the gut. In this way T cells are effectively recruited to form part of the first line of defense against pathogens. This is because T cells are targeted to and recirculated around primary infection sites. Overall this results in an extremely high concentration of lymphocytes in this region; 70% of the immunoglobulin-producing cells are found in the mucosal surfaces of the body. History It was first suggested by Griselli that there were different pathways of T cell migration. Initial theories that the T cells were targeted not to the tissue but to the antigens were disproved, as work by Cahill showed that purified T cells would relocate to the region of activation. For example, T cells activated in the Peyer's patch lymph nodes, found in the gut, would return to the gut. Subsequent work looked to explain the cause of this T cell targeting. Diagram of the regions of the gut lymphocytes Originally it was theorized that the micro-environment of lymphoid tissues provided the cues for the preferential homing of lymphocytes. While this may be the case to some extent, it is now widely held that the main driver in lymphocyte homing is the interactions between T cell adhesion molecules (lymphocyte homing receptors) and ligands (addressins) on the tissue high endothelial venules (HEVs). This theory arose from the observation that the cell surface integrins varied between different T cell populations. Work began to identify the differences and what they meant for T cell migration. It became apparent that there were significantly higher levels of the integrin Œ±4Œ≤7 on activated T cells in comparison to na√Øve T cells. Additionally, this integrin was much more common on CD8+ T cells activated in the Peyer's patches (PP T-cells) compared to other T cell subsets, such as peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes activated T cells. Mechanism The mechanism of gut specific homing is one largely based on interactions between receptors. =Rolling interaction= Lymphocytes migrate from the blood stream via a distinctive 'rolling interaction' mediated by interactions between cellular surface proteins. This 'rolling interaction' occurs in three stages: # Initial binding of a lymphocyte selectin and its ligand. This creates an unstable interaction where the lymphocyte is lightly held to the endothelium wall. The force of the lymph causes the cell to characteristically roll along the vessel. An example of this is the interaction between L-selectin and the PNAD (peripheral node addressin) ligand. # Arrest of the 'rolling' cell by activation step. Further interactions between proteins or activation via chemokines cause more stable forces to be formed between the cell and the vessel. The cell now is firmly attached to the vessel wall. Continuing the example the cell would be arrested by the interaction between ICAM and LFA-1 which are strengthened by chemokines. # Conformational change. Cellular activation causes a conformational change which results in the cell flattening against the vessel wall. Once flattened, the cell can undergo transendothelial migration. =Gut specific protein interactions= \\"Homing receptors\\" are crucial in forming in the interactions which allow lymphocyte movement. =Receptors involved= MadCAM-1 MadCam-1 receptor MadCAM-1 expression is continuous in the high endothelial venules of Peyer's patches and in the micro-vessels of the intestinal tract. MadCAM-1 inhibitors prevent T cell migration to the gut. Structural analysis of the MadCAM-1 protein shows that it is a 41.5 kDa transmembrane protein with a small cytoplasmic tail and a large extracellular region. This extracellular region includes three immunoglobin-like (Ig) domains. The last of which has 33% structural identity to the Ca2 domain of IgA-1. The first two of the domains are predicted to be the most important in the Œ±4Œ≤7 interaction. The MadCAM-1 protein has structural homology to the vascular surface receptors VCAM1 and ICAM at 28% and 32% respectively. Œë4Œ≤7 integrin This is expressed on activated T cell imprinted for gut- specific homing. It is the counter receptor for the MadCAM-1 protein and the interactions of which cause the initial interaction step in 'rolling' cell model of lymphocyte migration CCR9 CCR9 receptors are presented on the T cells and are involved in forming a more stable interaction between the lymphocyte and the vessel wall. The ligand for CCR9 proteins is the CCL25 chemokine (which is otherwise known as TECK) protein. CCL25 is a chemokine which, upon binding to its receptor CCR9 on the lymphocyte, activates a conformational change in surface integrins on that lymphocyte, enabling high- affinity binding to the vessel wall and subsequent transmigration. The CCL25 chemokine is prevalent in the epithelial tissue of the small intestine (7). It has been shown that CD8+ T cells activated in Peyer's patch lymph tissue display a tropism towards the CCL25 chemokine. The T cells migrate up a gradient towards CCL25. Other cells All GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue) DC, with an Œ± chain CD103, are capable of producing gut-homing T cells. From this it has been suggested that dendritic cells are imprinted in some way before reaching the lymphoid organs in order to induce homing ability. Vitamin A regulation Retinoic acid Vitamin A plays a fundamental part of the gut-specific homing response. Evidence shows that vitamin A is converted to retinoic acid (RA) by oxidation in the dendritic cells of the Peyers' patches. The presence of RA results in the expression of the key homing receptors, Œ±4Œ≤7 and CCR9, on the cell surface of T cells potentially through transcriptional regulation. =Production of retinoic acid= Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH) enzymes catalyse the oxidation of dietary vitamin A to retinoic acid. It is the presence of this retinoic acid which induces the expression of CCR9 and Œ±4Œ≤7. Lower concentrations of retinoic acid, inside the cell, result in a decreased expression of the chemokine receptor CCR9 which in turn limits the ability of the cell to enter the gut mucosa. While the expression of Œ±4Œ≤7 is also reduced under lower retinoic acid concentrations, it is predicted that the retinoic acid levels must be depleted to a greater extent to affect Œ±4Œ≤7 expression compared to CCR9. Western blot analysis showed dendritic cells from Peyers' patches produce both RALDH1 and ADH proteins. Additionally these have been found expressed in the epithelial cells of the small intestine. It therefore followed that these cells are capable of converting vitamin A into the major physiological form of RA: all-trans RA. Studies showing the DCs ability to catalyze the change of retinol to retinoic acid confirm this assumption. Vitamin A oxidation =Effect on expression of receptors= Research on mice showed that the level of retinoic acid in the cells did have a significant effect on the expression of receptors on the cell surface. Mice models showed that even a 0.1 nM increase in the concentration of retinoic acid in cells increased the expression of Œ±4. Furthermore, Œ≤7 expression was increased by raising the concentration of cellular retinoic acid. To ensure that increase in RA concentration was due to the catalytic enzymes ADH and RALDH, inhibitors of these enzymes were used. Citral, an inhibitor of the enzyme RALDH, suppressed the expression of Œ±4Œ≤7 adhesins on the cell surface suggesting that the vitamin A ‚Üí retinoic acid catalysis was important. =Homing ability= This, in theory, should increase the homing ability of the activated T cells to the gut. Evidence of this came from studies using RA-treated and vitamin A-deficient mice. In the mice with increased levels of RA there was a higher number of T cells found in the intestinal tissue. Research on vitamin A-deficient mice confirmed the reverse was true as there was significantly lower number of T cells found in the intestinal lamina propria compared to control mice. Contrastingly, there was no such decrease in T cell numbers in the lungs and liver of the deficient mice implying that the RA imprinting pathway is unique to gut-specific homing T cells. =Transcriptional regulation by retinoic acid= It has theorized that the RA levels affect the expression of the MadCAM-1 and Œ±4Œ≤7 receptors by transcriptional regulation. The RAR and RXR receptors, which are the nucleic receptors for RA, can form heterodimers given specific cellular conditions. In the dimer conformation, the receptors are able to bind RARE or RXRE sequences found in DNA. These genetic regions are often found in the 5' end of genes suggesting they play a regulatory role. In fact they are often found near the beginning or in introns of genes regulated in response to retinoid levels. Sections of these RARE sequences, and additionally RA boxes, have been found in the first exons of the genes which encode b7 and the CCR9 receptors. Using antagonist proteins against RAR subunit showed a reduction in the expression of alpha. Therefore, it may be that the expression of the alpha receptors are transcriptionally regulated by the concentration of RA in the cell. =Other effects of vitamin A on lymphocyte homing= Increased vitamin A concentrations was also shown to reduce the expression of the receptors P-Lig, E-Lig and Fuct-VII in vitro. This suggests that not only does vitamin A increase the ability of the T-cell to home to the gut it also simultaneously reduces the likelihood of the cell to bind to another tissue. Reasons for lymphocyte homing The most convincing argument is that by targeting the lymphocytes to the region in which they were activated it is more likely that they will come into contact with their cognate antigen. They are targeted to the region where the pathogen's antigen is most likely to be found within the periphery. Additionally, it is possible that tissue type may have an effect on the phenotypic traits of T-cells both upon activation and migration thorough the tissue. It would therefore seem sensible for the T cells to exhibit signs of preferential tissue as they are likely to perform their protective role in an environment they are most suited to. Health concerns An age-related decline in intestinal immune response is common in elderly people. This immunosenescence has been hypothesized to be due to impaired homing of lymphocytes to the Peyers' patches found in the gut. This process is not unique to humans and is documented in other animals including rhesus macaques and rats. Research has shown older rats had reduced expression of the key gut- specific homing receptors Œ±4Œ≤7; and MadCAM-1. These older rats had 30% less Œ±4Œ≤7; and 17% less MadCAM-1 than juvenile rat equivalents. Whilst no causative relationship has been proved to date, it is speculated that the reduced expression of the receptors is responsible for overall loss in immune response. Additionally post-translation modifications may weaken the affinity of the receptors for each other. Future work Much greater work is needed to fully understand the conditions needed to cause tissue-specific homing. However, with greater understanding the field offer great potential in medical therapeutics. It may become possible to target oral attenuated vaccines to the gut mucosa. By doing this, it would hopefully render the vaccine more reliable and effective. Additionally, it may improve the treatment of chronic bowel disease. Other tissue specific lymphocyte homing Gut specific homing is the most understood of lymphocyte homing. However, there are many other examples which include: *Lymphoid specific homing- Homing of na√Øve T cells to the lymph tissue around the body. The adhesin expressed by the na√Øve T cells is L-selectin (1). once the T cells are activated they repress the expression of L selectin to allow them to migrate freely around the body in the blood. *Skin specific homing- Acts as a method of recruiting a large number of memory T cells to the skin, which poses a high risk of infection. Again this involves the expression of different integrins. In this case, in humans Œ±4Œ≤1 and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) are expressed on the T cell surface. These integrins interact with E-selectin molecules found on inflamed skin. *Breast specific homing- Involved in the redirection of T-cells to the mammary glands. this occurs in order for protective lymphocytes to be included in the breast milk. *B cell homing- There is limited knowledge of this as of late.

Connor operated the ferry for only one year and after his departure the operation of the ferry changed hands twice more before 1786.  History  The first true ferry to be employed in the harbour was not until 1816 the Sherbrooke classified as a Horseboat being powered by (in Sherbrooke‚Äôs case) nine horses walking in a circular motion in the centre of the ferry powering the central paddle. This ferry was thought to be a large improvement to the previous service due to its speed and ability to transport more people and cargo from either side of the harbour. This ferry operated in the harbour until 1830 when the first steam ferry, the Sir Charles Ogle, entered service. The continuing ferry service remained the only effective way of crossing the harbour until 1955, when the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge was first opened. The current generation of the ferry system was implemented by the former City of Dartmouth as part of major revitalization projects undertaken in both Dartmouth and Halifax in the 1970s. All five ferries currently in service were designed by Dartmouth company, E.Y.E. Marine Consultants.Meteghan River shipyard building fourth ferry for Halifax Dartmouth service In 1994, the City of Dartmouth transferred control of the ferry system to Metro Transit, later known as Halifax Transit.  Current operation  Today Halifax Transit maintains and operates the ferry service by providing two passenger ferry routes, one connecting downtown Halifax with Alderney Landing in Dartmouth (which operates daily) and the other connecting downtown Halifax with Woodside (Monday through Friday only). The harbour ferries are utilized by over 3,000 commuters daily.Halifax Transit, Dartmouth-Halifax Harbour Ferries Both routes operate using two vessels each on a fifteen-minute schedule during peak hours, and using one vessel each on a thirty-minute schedule off-peak.

The Vessel will be built by A. F. Theriault Shipyard, for a cost of $3,987,400.Briand Medel, \\"New Halifax ferry en route\\", Yarmouth Bureau, Halifax Chronicle Herald, June 17, 2013 To maintain compatibility with the existing ferry terminal facilities, the new vessel will use the same hull design first used in the Halifax III in 1979. However updates are planned for many of the ship's systems as well as the interior. The name of the vessel was chosen by the people of Halifax after a competition conducted by Halifax Transit. At the end of the competition over 12,800 votes were cast with the name Christopher Stannix winning 61% of the votes. MCpl Christopher Stannix was a local army reservist with The Princess Louise Fusiliers. He was killed in April 2007 by an improvised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan.New Halifax ferry to be named after Christopher Stannix In early June 2014 the winner of the competition to name the new ferry was announced. (Corporal) Darrel MacDonald, a former member of The Princess Louise Fusiliers and a resident of Halifax, was the first person to submit the \\"Christopher Stannix\\" name for voting. He was awarded a full year transit pass and reportedly donated it to the IWK Health Centre (Women and Newborn Health Social Work Department). The passes were converted to sheets of single use transit tickets and will be passed out at the discretion of the staff within the department. = Fleet renewal = Following completion of the Christopher Stannix, Halifax Regional Council approved the purchase of two additional new ferries, expected to be delivered in spring 2015 and 2016 respectively. Two aging members of Halifax Transit's existing fleet will be retired when these vessels are delivered. These ferries will be built by A. F. Theriault Shipyard, the same yard responsible for the Christopher Stannix.Building two more ferries for Halifax-Dartmouth service The first of these two ferries, named the Craig Blake after another Canadian Forces member killed in Afghanistan, entered service in 2015. Another ferry is expected to enter service in 2016, named after Viola Desmond. On December 6, 2016 Regional Council approved the purchase of two more ferries. This purchase will allow the service to operate with two modern, reliable ferries on each routes, and one spare for routine maintenance and unexpected breakdowns. = Fast ferry service = In recent years, following unfulfilled plans to implement commuter rail, the municipality has begun to plan several new high speed ferry routes on Halifax Harbour, including service to Purcell's Cove, Bedford, Eastern Passage and Shannon Park. These routes would be served by wave piercing catamarans capable of speeds of approximately 40 knots. Details have not been finalized, however it is likely that the downtown Halifax terminal would act as a hub, with all routes radiating outward. Studies and trials have been undertaken for a Bedford-Halifax route, which will likely be the first high speed service.TDV Consulting, \\"Bedford-Halifax Fast Ferry Cultivation Study\\", Halifax Regional Municipality, Final 2005 Halifax Transit ferry routes.

North Korea and the former country North Vietnam established formal diplomatic relations on January 31, 1950. In July 1957, North Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh visited North Korea; North Korean leader Kim Il-sung visited North Vietnam in November‚ÄìDecember 1958 and November 1964. In February 1961, the two governments concluded an agreement on scientific and technical cooperation. North Vietnam merged with South Vietnam in 1976 to become the modern country of Vietnam. History North Korean embassy in Hanoi, Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, North Korea provided substantial economic and military aid to North Vietnam (1966: 12.3 million rubles; 1967: 20 million; 1968: 12.5 million; 1969: 12.5 million). In 1968, approximately 2,000 Vietnamese students and trainees received education for free in Korea. As a result of a decision of the Korean Workers' Party in October 1966, in early 1967 North Korea sent a fighter squadron to North Vietnam to back up the North Vietnamese 921st and 923rd fighter squadrons defending Hanoi. They stayed through 1968; 200 pilots were reported to have served. In addition, at least two anti-aircraft artillery regiments were sent as well. North Korea also sent weapons, ammunition and two million sets of uniforms to their comrades in North Vietnam. Kim Il-sung is reported to have told his pilots to \\"fight in the war as if the Vietnamese sky were their own\\". From 1968, however, relations between Pyongyang and Hanoi started to deteriorate for various reasons. Anxious to keep the United States bogged down in Vietnam, North Korea disagreed with North Vietnam's decision to enter peace negotiations with the U.S., and reacted negatively to the Paris Peace Accords. During the Cambodian Civil War, North Korea approved the Chinese plan to create a \\"united front of the five revolutionary Asian countries\\" (China, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), whereas North Vietnam rejected it on the grounds that such a front would exclude the Soviet Union and challenge Vietnamese dominance in Indochina.Szalontai, Bal√°zs (2014) \\"Political and Economic Relations between the Communist States\\". In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 316. Around this time, the Vietnam War came to an end. The government of North Vietnam, unlike that of North Korea, succeeded in reunifying the whole country by 1975. During the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War, the North Korean leadership condemned the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, refused to recognize the People's Republic of Kampuchea, and allowed the exiled Norodom Sihanouk to stay in Korea.Kim, Kook- Chin (1987) \\"An Overview of North Korean‚ÄìSoutheast Asian Relations\\". In: Park Jae Kyu, Byung Chul Koh, and Tae-Hwan Kwak (eds.), The Foreign Relations of North Korea. Boulder, CO: Westview Press. . According to the historian, Balazs Szalontai, Vietnam came to resent what it saw as North Korea's self-centred behaviour, and the two governments became rivals rather than friends. During on the same time, it was said that Pol Pot, the leader of Khmer Rouge, managed to have a visit to North Korea, one of only two foreign trips led by Pol Pot, further strained North Korean‚ÄìVietnamese relations, as Pol Pot was a recognized enemy of Vietnam.https://natethayer.wordpress.com/category/khmer- rouge-and-north-korea/ Gradual decline in relations In the 1990s and 2000s, North Korean-Vietnamese relations declined even more due to investment and trade disputes. The former Vietnamese ambassador to South Korea is a graduate of North Korea's Kim Il-sung University. The son of a former staff member in the Vietnamese embassy in Pyongyang, who also attended Kim Il-sung University between 1998 and 2002, gave an interview in 2004 with South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo about the experiences he had while living there. While its giant neighbor China is an obvious example of economic reform to follow, experts say Vietnam is seen as a far better model by North Korea. Thaw in relations/Hanoi summit The White House gave confirmation of the planned summit between North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump on September 11, 2018. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the DPRK and U.S. were ‚Äòworking diligently‚Äô to make sure the conditions were right for the summit. Trump announced the host country, Vietnam, and the dates, February 27‚Äì28, during his second State of the Union Address on February 5, 2019. On February 8, 2019, President Trump announced that Hanoi, Vietnam would host the summit meeting. Kim Jong-un came to Vietnam on February 26th on a 60-hour train ride to attend the Hanoi Summit. He was greatly welcomed by the Vietnamese officials and made a visit to the North Korean Embassy in Hanoi. On March 1st and 2nd, Kim Jong-un made an official visit to Vietnam, 60 years after his grandfather's first visit to the country. He met the President Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng, Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c and National Assembly Chairwoman Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Kim Ng√¢n.

Gameplay The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is set in an open world environment, in which the player can roam around and explore at will; in its opening the game notes that it \\"does not hold [the player's] hand\\", and as such features very little by way of explanation to the mechanics. To piece together the story, the player must solve the deaths of the Carter family. Upon finding a dead body, the player can use paranormal abilities in order to recreate the events: first it must sense where important objects are located and restore the scene to its original state, and then reassemble the timeline of events tied to a certain death. The game also features additional \\"stories\\" that must be fully uncovered for the game to receive its final ending; some of these are puzzles, others are more akin to a stealth game which cause the game to be over if the player fails. Plot In 1973, paranormal investigator Paul Prospero receives a fan letter from 12-year-old Ethan Carter, inspiring him to journey to Ethan's hometown of Red Creek Valley, Wisconsin. Upon arrival, he learns Ethan has gone missing and begins encountering unsettling paranormal phenomena, as well as evidence of recent violence in the tiny mining village. As his investigation progresses, Prospero learns the Carter family's dark secret: Ethan had released a malevolent spirit known as the Sleeper through witchcraft, threatening their lives. When his uncle Chad and mother Missy tried to sacrifice him to appease the Sleeper, Ethan escaped with the help of his father Dale; Missy then killed Chad when he attacked Dale, and Dale later killed Missy. Dale then committed suicide in an effort to not become a vessel of the Sleeper as Ethan's older brother Travis now was. Travis turns on Ethan, forcing his grandfather Ed to kill Travis. Ethan and Ed try to destroy the Sleeper's chambers, but Ed traps Ethan inside the chamber and waits to die outside as Ethan sets a fire within. Prospero finds Ethan, but he suddenly vanishes after they both realise Prospero was too late. If Prospero has uncovered all of Ethan's stories around the world, then using an elaborate mural created by Ethan, Prospero discovers that he is in fact a figment of Ethan's imagination. The cult of the Sleeper was an invention, as were the deaths of the family members during Prospero's investigation. Ethan had built a sanctuary inside a mansion in town to escape his family, particularly his overbearing mother, and abusive brother and uncle. When his mother accidentally sets the mansion on fire, trapping Ethan in the room with no way to save himself, he summons Prospero to provide comfort as he's consumed by the smoke by enacting a fictitious series of events. Having fulfilled his purpose, Prospero tells Ethan to let go, and that a new story awaits before both of them fade from the world. Development The game was developed by three former People Can Fly employees, who had previously worked on first-person shooter video games with the company. The team was interested in moving into more story-heavy games. They almost released Come Midnight as a collaboration with THQ, although ultimately this was canceled. Upon forming their own company, The Astronauts, the team had the freedom they needed to work on such a game. From the start the game was always going to be focused on horror. In dissecting the genre, lead designer Adrian Chmielarz discovered the genre of weird fiction and took inspiration from \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\". Although he stated that he had the basic idea in mind prior to reading it, the story helped solidify the concept in Chmielarz's mind. Feeling that settings in games inherently felt \\"a bit artificial\\", the team instead were inspired by nature to create a more natural-feeling world. The setting in particular takes inspiration from the Polish Karkonosze mountains. Chmielarz described the game as being \\"shot\\" there. The team used photogrammetry technology in order to create the in-game environment and make it look like the mountain range. Reception The Vanishing of Ethan Carter received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 4 version 82.46% based on 26 reviews and 81/100 based on 32 reviews and the Microsoft Windows version 81.27% based on 41 reviews and 82/100 based on 65 reviews. The game sold 60,000 copies in its first month on sale. As of December, 2017, the game has sold over a million copies. Julian Aidan from Hardcore Gamer praised its well-designed open-world, visuals and story, but criticized the gameplay for being too linear, as well as finding the narrative aspect of the game weak. Shaun McInnis from GameSpot praised the simple yet enjoyable puzzle-solving, captivating story, outstanding graphics and breathtaking environments, but criticized its weird and vague auto-save system. Christopher Livingston from PC Gamer also criticized the save system, but praised the decent voice acting, enjoyable puzzle-solving, as well as the intriguing, satisfying, and wonderfully restrained story. =Awards= The Vanishing of Ethan Carter received the Best Game Innovation Awards at 2015's British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA). Port The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was ported to Unreal Engine 4, and was released for the PlayStation 4 on July 15, 2015. The Unreal Engine 4 port was released for the PC on September 11, 2015, under the title Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux. Apart from the new engine, the revised version includes a new save system, and eliminates the backtracking from the ending sequence of the game.

Charles Mary Wentworth sailed on 15 August 1798 with a crew of 67 men and four boys. She headed southward to the West Indies pursuing French and Spanish vessels. On this cruise they were able to take two prizes from a Spanish brigantine, Santisima del Carmen. The Spanish brigantine was carrying cocoa, cotton, and sugar when she was captured on 4 September. She arrived in Liverpool on 11 September. The cargo was auctioned off for ¬£7,460 while the ship was auctioned for ¬£871.10. The other prize was the American brig Morning Star, recaptured from the French. A second cruise began on 3 February 1799. Fly and Victory joined Wentworth to cruise to the West Indies. The Spanish brig Nostra Seignora del Carmen was steered into Liverpool with a cargo valued at over ¬£10,000. The Royal Gazette reported that on May 21, 1799 Wentworth returned to Liverpool with four Spanish vessels following. The Royal Gazette says that the reported prizes were a \\"brig of 14 guns, and 140 tones of burthen, laden with Wine, Brandy and Flour', a copper-bottomed schooner of 140 tons burthen, mounting 6 guns, laden with Cocoa, a schooner of 60 tons, and another 40 tons, coasters, laden with dry goods and sundry other valuable articles.\\" The value of the cargo was ¬£16,000. Wentworths success led within a few months to the commissioning of six other privateer vessels at Liverpool as well as one from nearby Shelburne, and four more from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Several of these new Nova Scotian privateers were in fact French and Spanish prizes to Wentworth that were now turned against their former owners.

Prior to becoming a legislator, Woodward worked as a lineman for Boston Edison. Political career In 1976, Woodward defeated incumbent State Representative Alan Danovitch. During his early years in the legislature, Woodward often opposed House leadership, but did so without voicing loud criticisms, which allowed him to have a good relationship with them. In 1985, reform-minded George Keverian became Speaker and chose Woodward to replace Theodore J. Aleixo, Jr., a Thomas W. McGee loyalist, as Chairman of the Insurance Committee. =Mandatory seat-belt law= On December 26, 1983, Woodward's eighteen-year-old daughter Carolyn was killed in an automobile accident. She was the passenger in a car that was struck head-on by a drunken driver. Based on his conversations with the emergency-room physician at the hospital where his daughter died, Woodward believed that his daughter would've survived the crash had she been wearing a seat belt. After the accident, Woodward became an ardent supporter of the proposed mandatory seat-belt law. The mandatory seat-belt law passed the House on July 16, 1985 and, after it passed the Senate, was signed into law. The law was struck down by voters via a ballot question in the 1986 election. In 1987, Woodward supported a bill that would raise the age for mandatory car-seat restraints from 5 to 12. He also sponsored legislation that would require the installation of breath alcohol ignition interlock devices on cars of repeat drunk driving offenders. =Other legislation= Woodward opposed the \\"Gay Rights Bill\\", which prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in the areas of housing, insurance, credit and employment. Woodward proposed building a 500-bed, medium-security prison on state land next to Massachusetts Correctional Institution ‚Äì Cedar Junction. The proposal would've prevented the state from building a prison on a controversial site in New Braintree, Massachusetts and prevented the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) from using the Walpole site for a landfill. The proposal was supported by Massachusetts Department of Correction Commissioner George Vose, but opposed by Governor Michael Dukakis and the MWRA. The prison was constructed in New Braintree as planned, however Dukakis' successor, William Weld, converted the facility into a law enforcement training center shortly after construction was completed. The MWRA entered an agreement to have its sludge cake output disposed of at a commercial landfill in Utah and the Walpole landfill was never built. Post-political career In 1991, Woodward was removed from his position as Insurance Committee Chairman by Keverian's successor Charles Flaherty. In 1992 it was announced that he would retire from the legislature to become an administrative judge with the state's Industrial Accident Board. =Illegal gratuities= On July 28, 1995, Woodward was indicted on charges of depriving taxpayers of honest services through mail and wire fraud, conspiracy, interstate travel to commit bribery, and lying on State Ethics Commission reports. According to United States Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Chiel, Woodward received illegal gratuities from John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. lobbyist F. William Sawyer from 1986 to 1992 and attempted to conceal it by filing false financial disclosure forms. The gratuities allegedly included free golf trips to Savannah, Georgia, Orlando, Florida, Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona as well as a trip to Super Bowl XX in New Orleans, Louisiana. Woodward's attorney claimed that Sawyer gave Woodward the gifts out of friendship, not in an attempt to influence him as a legislator. Woodward's trial began on September 16, 1996. October 2, 1996, he was found guilty of five counts of accepting illegal gratuities during his tenure as Chairman of the Insurance Committee, but not guilty of twenty-one counts that occurred between his removal as Chairman and his departure from the House. On February 7, 1997, Judge Douglas P. Woodlock dismissed one of the five counts and sentenced Woodward to six months in a federal halfway house and fined him $5,000. In 2002, the Massachusetts Retirement Board voted to revoke Woodward's pension.US Department of justice  In the Supreme Court of the United States  OCTOBER TERM, 1998  References Category:1939 births Category:Dean College alumni Category:Massachusetts Democrats Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:Politicians from Boston Category:People from Walpole, Massachusetts Category:Politicians convicted of mail and wire fraud Category:Politicians convicted under the Travel Act Category:Living people Category:Massachusetts politicians convicted of crimes ","title":"Francis H.

In the early 21st century, DNA analysis confirmed that the Spanish wine grape variety of the same name grown in the Canary Islands is a completely different and distinct variety with no close genetic relationship to the Italian Forastera.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 360-361 Allen Lane 2012 History While Forastera has had a long history of cultivation in the Campanian islands of Ischia and Procida (outlined in red box), the grape may have originated in the Lombardy province of Bergamo (highlighted). Ampelographers believe that the name Forastera is derived from the Italian word forestiero which means \\"foreign\\" and could be an indication that the grape didn't originate on the Campanian islands. However, the first recorded mention of the grape was on the island of Ischia in the 1877 writings of winemaker Giuseppe Rovasenda, the Conti di Rovasenda whose ancestors served in the court of the Dukes of Savoy. Additional late 19th century writings from ampelographer Giuseppe Froio also described the grape growing in Ischia. Rovasenda also noted back in 1877 that Forastera was also being cultivated in the province of Bergamo in Lombardy around the town of Grumello del Monte though the grape is no longer grown there today though this accounts hints that the \\"foreign\\" grape may have a northern Italian origin. It was once thought the Campanian Forastera was at some point brought to the Canary Islands where the a white Forastera grape is still grown and permitted for us in several Denominaci√≥n de Origen (DO) wines but DNA evidence in the early 21st century showed that the Italian and Spanish varieties are distinct and not closely related. Viticulture Forastera is an early to mid-ripening grape variety that is noted for being very vigorous and prone to producing a large canopy that may need to be kept in check by pruning and canopy management techniques. Wine regions A view of the island of Ischia from the island of Procida where Forastera is grown. In 2000, there were of Forastera growing in Italy, almost exclusively on the islands of Ischia and Procida. The grape is primarily found in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Ischia where it is often blended with Biancolella and other local varieties such as Arilla and San Lunardo. The grape is also permitted in some of the DOC wines of Sardinia though it is rarely found there. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, as a varietal, Forastera tends to produce light-bodied and easy drinking wines in both a still and sparkling style that are characterized by fresh fruit flavors. Synonyms Over the years, Forastera has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Ferestiera, Forastera blanca, Forastiera, Forestera, Forestiera, Forestiero, Frastera, Furastera, Furastiera and Uva dell'Isola (on the island of Procida).Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Forastera Accessed: March 27th, 2014 References Category:White wine grape varieties ","title":"Forastera"},{"id":"42326835","text":"Chaperone-usher fimbriae (CU) are linear, unbranching, outer-membrane pili secreted by gram-negative bacteria through the chaperone-usher system rather than through type IV secretion or extracellular nucleation systems. These fimbriae are built up out of modular pilus subunits, which are transported into the periplasm in a Sec dependent manner. Chaperone-usher secreted fimbriae are important pathogenicity factors facilitating host colonisation, localisation and biofilm formation in clinically important species such as uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Structure =Overall= All chaperone/usher systems are found within gene clusters consisting of at least an usher, a chaperone and one or more fimbriae subunits. Overall the system includes periplasmic chaperones, periplasmic and extracellular pilus subunits, dimeric usher outer membrane pore and associated Sec machinery. The Pilus subunits polymerise via a non-covalent interaction to form the mature pilus which consists of an adhesive tip, helical body and an usher bound base. The P-pilus (pap) system is one of the best characterised and is shown below. A schematic overview of the pap chaperone-usher system showing all subunits and their organisation. PapD is the chaperone; PapC is the usher; PapA and the remaining subunits form the fimbria itself =Usher structure and function= The usher forms the outer-membrane pore and functions in vivo as a dimer, though only one of the ushers is active at any one time. The usher pore (PapC) is formed by a 24 stranded beta barrel with 4 additional domains: N-terminal domain (NTD), Plug domain, and two C-terminal domains (CTD1 and CTD2 respectively). The NTD and CTDs function to bring chaperone/subunit complexes to the growing pilus and facilitate translocation across the pore. The plug domain acts to stop premature formation of a pilus and can either be located inside the pore or on the periplasmic side of the membrane. In the active dimeric usher one of the usher has the plug located periplasmically and the other has it located inside the translocation pore. =Chaperone structure and function= The periplasmic chaperone (PapD) has a 'boomerang' structure formed by an immunoglobulin (Ig) like fold with an essential C-terminal extension (G1). This fold is formed by 13 Œ≤ strands (A1-G1) and 4 short Œ± helices. Chaperones belong to one of two families based on the length of the loop connecting the beta strands F1 and G1. Long looped chaperones are FGL and short looped chaperones are FGS. The chaperone functions to stop aggregation and degradation of pilus subunits by binding their interfacing regions and facilitating correct protein folding before bringing them to the usher/fimbriae complex. =Pilin subunit structure and function= PAP pilin major protein, PapA homo13mer, top view, E.Coli. The pilus subunit structure also has an Ig-like fold but with an essential N-terminal extension rather than a C-terminal extension. Because this N-terminal extension is the same Œ≤ strand that normally completes the Ig fold, a large hydrophobic cleft is formed in the mature subunit (P1-P5), this cleft is both essential to pilus biogenesis but also necessitates a chaperone to stabilise the structure. Particular subunits may have additional domains e.g. papG has an adhesive lectin domain. In vivo pilus subunits function to form the main body of the helical pilus (approximately 3.28 subunits per turn), and the adhesive head. Biogenesis Pilus biogenesis proceeds via the strand complementation mechanism, the mechanism functions as a direct consequence of the structures of both the chaperones and pilus subunits. Both the G1 extension of the chaperone and the N-terminal extension of the pilus subunits can bind to the hydrophobic P1-P5 cleft. When the G1 is bound it binds in a parallel conformation stabilising the subunit structure but doesn't form a true Ig fold (which is anti-parallel). It also only binds the cleft from sites P1-P4 leaving the P5 pocket exposed. When another subunit binds the hydrophobic cleft it binds in a P5-P2 anti-parallel fashion creating the most energetically favourable conformation of a true Ig-fold. When a chaperone/subunit complex is brought to the growing usher/pilus complex (note that a chaperone/subunit complex forms the base of this) the NTD and CTDs of the usher dimer bring and hold the chaperone/subunit complex to the pilus base. Here the N-terminal extension of the subunit interacts with the free P5 pocket of the pilus. This binding causes a residue by residue 'unzipping' of the chaperone's G1 strand with concurrent 'zipping' of the N-terminal extension of the chaperone/subunit complex, unknown as the zip in-zip out mechanism. Once the chaperone has been displaced it diffuses back to the sec machinery to bind another emerging pilus subunit. The usher using is CTDs then translocates the longer pilus across the translocation pore by one residue until the chaperone is in close association with the usher. This translocation is coupled with a slight rotation giving the pilus its helical structure. This growth proceeds until a terminating subunit binds the pilus (if one exists), terminating subunits lack the P5 pocket and thus almost irreversibly bind their chaperone. Since the usher can only translocate pilus subunits and not chaperone/subunit complexes, and the fact that the chaperone can't be energetically out-competed by another subunit (due to lack of P5) this terminating subunit anchors the pilus to the outer membrane and stop any further pilus growth. Nomenclature and Classification Historically classification of fimbriae was made based on their appearance under the microscope creating 4 classes: Afimbrial, type 1 fimbriae, bundle forming (type IV) pilus and curli. However this type of classification doesn't give any measure of relatedness and thus has been superseded by a phylogenetic system. In chaperone/usher fimbriae there are broadly two types of classification: Based on the type of usher present, or based on the type of chaperone present. As stated previously there are two types of chaperone; FGL and FGS, and this is the basis of chaperone classification. All FGL chaperones are associated with afimbrial secretion and all FGS chaperones are associated with fimbrial secretion. Using the usher as the base of classification forms 5 clades: alpha, beta, gamma, pi and sigma, and four sub clades: gamma 1-4. The naming of the beta and gamma clades are simply alphabetical, whereas the others are named by a defining feature: alpha for alternative chaperone/usher family; pi for P-pilus (pyelonephritis associated); and sigma for spore coat pilus from Myxococcus xanthus. All FGL chaperones are found in sub-clade gamma-3, all other clades and sub-clades are FGS. Pathogenicity Chaperone/usher fimbriae have many roles, in many stages of pathogenicity in several species. The most well understood are roles in adhesion, innate immune evasion and localisation. Adhesion is facilitated by the lectin domain at the tip of chaperone/usher fimbriae, this domain of FimH is well understood. FimH is the first subunit of the type I pilus in species such as UPEC and binds to D-mannosylated residues in the bladder, allowing pathogen adhesion and colonisation. Immune evasion is also facilitated by the tip adhesin, for example the binding of Decay accelerating factor (DAF) by gamma3 clade fimbriae inhibit effective complement activation. Localisation could be performed by sequential expression of different chaperone/usher systems. Most species of pathogenic bacteria express more than one type of chaperone/usher system, for example in Pseudomonas aeruginosa there are five different systems. UPEC expresses both the type 1 fimbriae and the P-pilus (pap) which it expresses sequentially possibly to facilitate migration from the bladder (type I fimbriae) to the kidney (pap). This importance in pathogenicity makes the chaperone/usher system an attractive target for novel drug therapies. By targeting pathogenicity instead of the organism (in the case of conventional antibiotics) the strong selective pressure for evolution of resistance is removed. In the case of UPEC there have been some success in pilicidal (stopping pilus formation) clinical trials and the development of an effective vaccine in mice and cynomolgus monkeys based on FimCH complex.

It was circumscribed by British mycologist Edwin John Butler in 1911. Species in the genus have a polycentric thallus and reproduce asexually by zoospores that have a whiplash-like flagella. They are mostly isolated from soils in tropical countries, commonly in ponds, rice fields, and slow-moving rivers. Morphology Allomyces thalli consist of a cylindrical trunk-like basal cell that gives rise to well-developed, highly branched rhizoids that anchor the thallus to the substrate. The trunk-like basal cell also gives rise to numerous dichotomously branched side branches that terminate as either resistant sporangia, zoosporangia, or gametangia depending on the life cycle stage. Septa are sometimes present, especially at the base of reproductive organs. Germling of Allomyces strain WJD103 on nutrient agar. Note the trunk- like basal cell separated from the dichotomously branched branches that will give rise to the reproductive organs. Zoomed out view of a mature thallus of Allomyces strain WJD103. Note the orange-brown zoosporangia and resting sporangia at the terminals of the branches. Life cycle and mating There are three distinct life cycles in Allomyces, and some authors delineate the subgenera Euallomyces, Cystogenes, and Brachyallomyces based on the life cycles while others do not. The Euallomyces life cycle is an anisogamous alternation of generations between a haploid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte. In this life cycle, the two stages are indistinguishable until reproductive organs are formed. Gametophytes produce colorless female gametangia and orange male gametangia; the orange coloration is transferred to the male gametes and is due to the presence of gamma carotenoid. Formation of male gametes is faster than of female gametes. Both male and female gametangia release motile gametes, but the male gametes are smaller and orange. Female gametangia and gametes release a pheromone called sirenin that attracts the male gametes. Male gametes produce a pheromone called parisin. Female gametes are sluggish and stay close to the female gametangia, which sets up a strong concentration gradient of sirenin. Fertilization of female gametes by male gametes appears to be near 100% efficient. Fertilization takes place when two gametes contact one another. The plasma membranes fuse to form a binucleate cell with nuclear fusion quickly following. The resulting zygote is initially biflagellate, but it soon encysts and germinates. It grows into a dichotomously branched sporophyte, which forms two types of sporangia: thin- walled zoosporangia that may be colorless or orange and thick-walled resting sporangia that are reddish-brown due to the presence of melanin pigments. The thin-walled zoosporangia give rise to motile zoospores that germinate and grow into another sporophyte. The resting sporangia undergo meiosis at germination and give rise to haploid zoospores that will germinate and grow into gametophytes. In Cystogenes life cycle the resting sporangia (from the sporophyte) give rise to biflagellated, bi-nucleated zoospores that will encyst, undergo meiosis, and germinate to yield motile gametes. These gametes will then fuse in pairs and the resulting zygotes germinate and grow into new sporophytes. In the Brachyallomyces life cycle, the gametophytic stage is missing altogether. Ecology Allomyces species seem to have a global distribution and are readily isolated from soils and waters by baiting with a sterile seed. Species of Allomyces can be parasitized by Catenaria allomycis, Rozella allomycis, and Olpidium allomycetos. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed in 1911 by Butler and numerous species have been described. Based on type of life cycle, Emerson delineated three subgenera: Euallomyces, Cystogenes, and Brachyallomyces. Based on a molecular phylogeny using portions of the nuclear ribosome, it appears Euallomyces and Brachyallomyces are polyphyletic but Cystogenes is monophyletic. As well, it appears several species in the genus are polyphyletic.

Described by German botanist Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth in 1833, the genus contains some species that are parasitic on vascular plants, including P. alfalfae and P. maydis, causative agents of crown wart of alfalfa and brown spot of corn, respectively. Of the chytrid genera, Physoderma is the oldest.Sparrow FK. 1960. Aquatic phycomycetes. 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Press. However, species were confused with the rust fungi, the genus Synchytrium, and the genus Protomyces of Ascomycota.Karling, J.S. 1977. Chytridiomycetarum Iconographia. Monticello, New York: Lubrecht & Cramer. Members of Physoderma are obligate parasites of pteridophytes and angiosperms. There are approximately 80 species within this genus (depending on whether one includes those traditionally belonging to Urophlyctis). Taxonomic History The genus was erected in 1833 on the basis of resting spore development and included 6 species.Karling, J.S. 1950. The genus Physoderma (Chytridiales). Llyodia. 13(1): 29. Unfortunately, his original diagnosis was very similar to that of Protomyces, which led others to place species in the wrong genus. In 1877, Nowakowski erected the genus Cladochytrium in the Chytridiales, which led to the transfer of Physoderma to the Chytridiales as well by Schroeter in 1883. Just prior to that (1882), Schroeter added an additional 4 species to the genus and noted, for the first time, epibiotic, ephemeral zoosporangia. He also claimed that sexual reproduction was through the fusion of two cells and resulted in the resting spores. In 1889, Schroeter created the genus Urophlyctis for those species with epibiotic, ephemeral zoosporangia and sexually derived resting spores. He placed both in the same subfamily as Cladochytrium. In 1891, Fischer refuted Schroeter's observations on sexual reproduction and merged Physoderma and Urophlyctis with Cladochytrium. In 1897, Schroeter separated them once more. Magnus, in 1901, used characteristics of the resting spore and host plant reaction to distinguish between Physoderma and Urophlyctis. He claimed that resting spores from Physoderma were globose and ellipsoidal, and those from Urophlyctis were flattened on one side. Physoderma species cause discoloration and slight malformation, while Urophlycits cause significant malformation and hypertrophy. Sparrow, in numerous publications, expressed concerns over the characters used to distinguish the two genera. In 1943, Sparrow suggested that the genus be merged with Urophlyctis, which was done by Karling in 1950. He also moved Physoderma to its own family, the Physodermataceae. Sparrow, in 1962, decided the genera were distinct based on morphology and host reaction. However, at this time, the two genera are considered synonymous.Porter TM, W Martin, TY James, JE Longcore, FH Gleason, PH Adler, PM Letcher, & R Vilgalys. 2011. Molecular phylogeny of the Blastocladiomycota (Fungi) based on nuclear ribosomal DNA. Fungal Biology 115: 381-392. Typically, it was thought that Physoderma was related to the polycentric genera Cladochytrium and Nowakowskiella Based on the ultrastructure of the zoospore, it was realized that Physoderma belongs to the Blastocladiales, which later became the Blastocladiomycota. Recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that Physoderma and Urophlycits might be separate genera. Morphology & Life Cycle Physoderma species are characterized as having a both a monocentric thallus and an endobiotic polycentric thallus. Resting spores germinate in the spring to produce zoospores that will infect the host. The initial infection gives rise to monocentric, epibiotic zoosporangium anchored with endobiotic rhizoids confined to a single host cell. The zoosporangium has been characterized as Rhizidium or Phlyctochytrium like; it usually has discharge papilla through which the zoospores are released. (Physoderma is considered operculate, though some species once in Urophlyctis appear to be inoperculate.) The liberated zoospores infect new host cells, and in this fashion, an infection can go through several generations. As well, the sporangia are internally proliferous; that is, they can produce a second round of zoospores after releasing the first one. In late spring and summer, the zoospores will begin to develop into an endobiotic polycentric thallus. This thallus is often extensive, infecting many host cells, with highly branched, fine rhizoids. These rhizoids can bear intercalary cells, which many be once or twice septate (and what Schroeter saw as evidence of sexual reproduction). The endobiotic thallus gives rise to large, thick-walled, dark-colored resting spores that take the shape of the host cell. It appears the resting spores are formed from the intercalary cells. These resting spores will over winter and germinate in the spring. Ecology Many species of Physoderma infect marsh plants, and several are confined to the submerged portion of hosts. Infections are usually confined to the leaves and stems, or, less commonly, the petioles of the host plants; however, there are some species that also or specifically infect parts of the flower. A notable example is Physoderma deformans; it infects the flower of two species of Anemone. A curious side effect, flowers infected with P. deformans live longer than non-infected flowers. There is at least one known species that infects the roots of the host plant rather than the above- ground parts. Infections can cause discoloration, warts, or galls. Physoderma species can be highly specific in both host choice and area of infection. An example is P. dulichii, which only infects the upper epidermal cells on young leaves of Dulichium arundinaceum.Johns RM. 1966. Morphological and ecological study of Physoderma dulichii. American Journal of Botany 53(1):34-45. Another example are two species that infect Sium suave: one infects only the submerged portion of the plant, the other only infects the emergent portion of the plant, but they can be found growing on the same plant.Sparrow FK. 1979. Observations on chytridiaceous parasites of phanerograms XXVIII Physodermas on Sium suave. Mycologia 72(2):423-433 Due to their reliance on zoospores, Physoderma species require free water. As an example, P. dulichii requires at least an inch of standing water to initiate the infection of a host plant. Once the plant is infected, however, high humidity, dew, or rain is sufficient to keep the infection going through the growing season.

The concept is applicable to adults who are under care such as elderly people, people living with disability, and people with mental health problems. It has also been applied to children, including those living with disabilities.  History  The concept was first articulated in a 1972 article The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded by Robert Perske: > Overprotection may appear on the surface to be kind, but it can be really > evil. An oversupply can smother people emotionally, squeeze the life out of > their hopes and expectations, and strip them of their dignity. > Overprotection can keep people from becoming all they could become. Many of > our best achievements came the hard way: We took risks, fell flat, suffered, > picked ourselves up, and tried again. Sometimes we made it and sometimes we > did not. Even so, we were given the chance to try. Persons with special > needs need these chances, too. Of course, we are talking about prudent > risks. People should not be expected to blindly face challenges that, > without a doubt, will explode in their faces. Knowing which chances are > prudent and which are not ‚Äì this is a new skill that needs to be acquired. > On the other hand, a risk is really only when it is not known beforehand > whether a person can succeed. The real world is not always safe, secure, and > predictable, it does not always say ‚Äúplease,‚Äù ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. > Every day we face the possibility of being thrown into situations where we > will have to risk everything ‚Ä¶ In the past, we found clever ways to build > avoidance of risk into the lives of persons living with disabilities. Now we > must work equally hard to help find the proper amount of risk these people > have the right to take. We have learned that there can be healthy > development in risk taking and there can be crippling indignity in safety! In 1980, the concept was relied upon by Julian Wolpert, Professor of Geography, Public Affairs, and Urban Planning at Princeton University, to support his argument in a paper, \\"The Dignity of Risk\\", which has since been described as \\"seminal\\". Wolpert's argument was that a paternalistic approach to people living with disability, prioritizing safeguarding over the rights of individuals to independent decision-making, is a limitation on personal freedom. Conflict with duty of care Allowing people under care to take risks is often perceived to be in conflict with the caregivers' duty of care. Finding a balance between these competing considerations can be difficult when formulating policies and guidelines for caregiving. Problems of overprotection Wheelchair rugby is a full contact sport played by wheelchair users. In spite of the protective features of the wheelchairs, the risk of injury is significant. Overprotection of people with disabilities causes low self-esteem and underachievement because of lowered expectations that come with overprotection. Internalisation of low expectations causes the person with a disability to believe that they are less capable than others in similar situations. In elderly people, overprotection can result in learned dependency and a decreased ability for self-care: \\"It is possible to deliver physical care that has positive outcomes and returns a person to full function, yet, if during that care they have not been involved, allowed to make choices and respectfully assisted with activities of daily living, it may be possible to cause psychological damage through undermining that person's dignity.\\"  Independent living  The right to fail and the dignity of risk is one of the basic tenets of the philosophy of the independent living movement.  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  The first of eight \\"guiding principles\\" of the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states: \\"Respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one‚Äôs own choices, and independence of persons.\\"  See also  * Agency (sociology) * Gillick competence * Infantilization * Normalization * Institutional syndrome * Olmstead v.

Designed by Charles Gustafson, the Powerplus's engine was Indian's first flathead. Origin Charles Gustafson left Reading Standard in 1909 and joined Indian as Oscar Hedstrom's assistant. Gustafson had designed side valve \\"flathead\\" engines for Reading Standard, which had been the first motorcycle manufacturer in the United States to use a flathead engine in a production motorcycle. When Hedstrom left Indian in 1913, Gustafson became Indian's chief engineer. In late 1915, Indian introduced Gustafson's replacement for Hedstrom's V-twin engine. The new engine used side valves instead of the inlet-over-exhaust (IOE) valve layout used in Hedstrom's designs. The flathead engine was quieter and less expensive to manufacture than the earlier IOE engine and needed less maintenance. It was named \\"Powerplus\\" because its output of approximately was noticeably greater than that of the earlier engine. The new engine was installed in the existing frames for Indian V-twin motorcycles, and used existing drivetrain components, tanks, handlebars, and other components. The drive train included a clutch, a kickstarter, and a three-speed gearbox. The standard frame for the Powerplus had a conventional rigid rear wheel mounting, but the Powerplus was also available with Indian's Cradle Spring Frame. Introduced in 1913, the Cradle Spring Frame had a rear swingarm linked to trailing leaf springs. Controls Detail shot of 1918 Indian Powerplus, showing engine, with removable caps for valve removal, hand control levers for clutch, gearbox, and exhaust valve lifter, and pedal for rear drum brake The Powerplus had twist grips on both handles; the throttle was controlled by the left twist grip while the right twist grip advanced or retarded the spark. Three controls were on the right side of the gas tank, a vertically-operated shifter, an exhaust valve lifter, and a hand clutch lever. The clutch lever was linked to the clutch pedal positioned on the left side of the bike. Promotion and development Between 24 and 28 August 1915, Erwin \\"Cannonball\\" Baker rode an early Indian Powerplus from Vancouver to Tijuana in 3 days, 9 hours and 15 minutes, establishing a new \\"Three Flags\\" record.Motorcycle Illustrated, pp. 19, 21, Motorcycle Publishing, 1915 The Powerplus engine was revised in 1917 with the barrels and pistons lengthened by a quarter of an inch and the piston wrist pin relocated below the piston center. This was done to reduce the occurrence of piston slap. The valve caps in the cylinder head were finned from 1917 until the end of production. A larger engine, with a displacement of approximately , became available in 1920. End of production Production of the larger Powerplus engine ended in 1922, the year in which production of the Powerplus's eventual successor, the Chief, began production. The Powerplus was renamed the \\"Standard\\" in 1922, reflecting the fact that it was not as powerful as the Chief.

The brook rises from its source south of Hulland Ward, and flows for most of its length through the countryside north-west of Derby before entering a culvert to the north of the city centre; it reappears from this culvert and runs through a short section of open channel on the other side of the city before joining the Derwent. The brook is closely associated with the historical development and the early industrial heritage of Derby. Originally the course of the brook passed through the city in an open channel, but it was successively bridged and piped over the years, and by Victorian times it was almost completely covered. It is now hidden from view in a series of culverts as it flows beneath the centre of the city. Although concealed, its presence could not be ignored, with a number of notable floods occurring in Derby before significant changes, including diversions and relief culverts were deemed necessary to prevent further inundations. Course From its source south of Hulland Ward, the brook flows south-east where it is joined by the Black Brook, at Mercaston and is initially named after this village. To the south of Weston Underwood the name changes to the Cutler Brook, from where it flows through the parkland of Kedleston Hall. The channel through the park has been modified as part of the landscaping of the grounds in the 18th century into a series of lakes. Beside the upper lake is a neoclassical style boathouse and fishing room, beyond is a \\"very handsome stone bridge\\", where beneath the three arches, the brook also falls over a cascade. Continuing in a south-east direction, the Cutler brook meets a minor tributary that flows from Quarndon and the name changes to become the Markeaton brook. The larger brook then flows into Markeaton Park, where it is joined by its largest tributary the Mackworth Brook which drains the area around Mackworth and Kirk Langley. Kedleston Hall - Boat House and Bridge, where the brook has been landscaped into a series of lakes. Various channels exist within the park; the brook takes the northern channel with flow also being diverted into Markeaton Lake. The channels rejoin at Britannia Mill and continue through the West End of Derby, until the brook reaches the start of the Markeaton Brook Culvert at Ford Street. This culvert takes the brook beneath the centre of Derby, where it flows under the Strand, Victoria and Albert Street, to an unseen confluence of the Bramble brook. It crosses beneath the Morledge, before it finally re- emerges from the culvert into the Mill Fleam at the Cockpit island, and then runs alongside the Bass recreation ground, until it reaches the River Derwent. Catchment The brook and its tributaries drain a catchment area of , which lies to the north-west of Derby, between that of the River Ecclesbourne to the north, and various tributaries of the lower Dove, including the Hilton Brook to the south and west. The drainage basin has an annual average rainfall of , which is lower than the average of for England. The highest point in the catchment is at , near Crossways farm. It has been estimated that during a large storm the catchment can generate a flow of , within thirteen hours of intense rainfall. Summer flows are much smaller, with the brook producing a flow of only . The brook drains a catchment with a geology consisting of mainly Mercian mudstones and Siltstone, but with some Sandstone and Shales in the upper reaches. It has been designated as main river by the Environment Agency from Markeaton Park to its confluence with the Derwent. Mills The former Britannia Mill There were more than twelve probable water mills sites along the course of the brook, some of them mentioned in the Domesday Book when Derby was listed with having ten mills. Nearly all of them have been lost or demolished, although the mill at Mercaston survives as a private house, and Britannia mill is now part of The University of Derby. Nun‚Äôs mill was another site recorded in Derby, and mentioned as one of the goals in the description of the mob football game that took place in Derby until the 18th century. Floods Due to its location beside the confluence of the River Derwent and the Markeaton brook, Derby has a long history of being flooded from either the brook or the river. In the 19th century Glover collated information on many of the earlier floods in his ‚ÄòHistory of the County of Derby‚Äô. Those that referred to the Markeaton Brook extended back to 1610, when three prisoners in the original Derby gaol were drowned. The gaol or jail was located near the Cornmarket, and had underground cells beneath street level, that filled with floodwaters, \\"owing to a sudden rise\\" of the brook. St Werburgh's Church, Derby which is located next to the brook, suffered greatly from flood damage, such as in 1673, when \\"A great flood upon the Markeaton brook, carried away the hay, filled cellars as high as the Angel, Rotten Row, and broke down three of the ten bridges‚Äù, again in 1677 and in November 1698 ‚ÄúA great flood which washed down part of St. Werburgh‚Äôs church and the steeple fell.\\" The church faced further floods in the 18th and 19th centuries. In December 1740 there was; \\"A great flood in Derby. On Tuesday last, we had the greatest inundation of water here that ever was known, occasioned by the falling of a great quantity of snow and rain, which began on Sunday, and continued (almost without intermission) till Tuesday morning, at which time several streets, and all the rooms upon the ground floor were laid a great depth under water. Great damage was done to the houses and furniture; several walls were thrown down; bridges and great quantities of wood carried away, and numbers of cattle swept from pastures perished. The parish church of St. Werburgh received considerable damage, it having made so great a breach in the pavement throughout the church so as to require it to be new paved.\\" The former St Werburgh's Church and Tower Repairs to the paving in the church were also required after the largest flood in the 19th century in April 1842. Herbert Spencer, who was an engineer in Derby at that time, described the flood: \\"A tributary of the river Derwent which runs through Derby, called the Markeaton Brook, was raised suddenly to an immense height by a local deluge of rain, and overflowed to the extent of producing in the main street a flood of some six feet in depth: the level attained being so unusual that it was marked by an iron plate let into the wall. It occurred to me to write a report on this flood; and to make suggestions for the prevention of any like catastrophe hereafter. This report was presented to the Town Council, and afterwards printed and distributed by their order.\\" The iron flood mark from 1842 still exists on the Wardwick Tavern. Glover noted that the flood level in the Wardwick as ‚Äú4ft 3in‚Äù with the greatest depth of the flood being recorded in Willow row at ‚Äú6 ft‚Äù.Losses due to the floods was estimated at ¬£15,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). In the early 1930s there were two major floods caused by the brook, which provided the impetus to find a solution, and prevent further flooding in Derby. The first was in September 1931 when heavy rain across Derbyshire, caused substantial flooding from the brook in the centre of the town. Residents living alongside the course of the brook were trapped in their houses, and produce from nearby allotments was uprooted and swept through the streets. The second flood occurred less than a year later in May 1932; again intense rainfall caused the brook to overflow, with considerable flooding throughout the central shopping quarter. A contemporary account recalls that; \\"Water poured into the streets and many houses were filled to a depth of six or seven feet. In the low-lying parts of the town it gathered quickly and, by ten o‚Äôclock on this memorable Sunday morning, shops in the Cornmarket, St James‚Äôs Street and the bottom end of St Peter‚Äôs Street were immersed half-way up the windows. The centre of town presented the appearance of a lake and the sight was unforgettable.\\" Following the flood, the Mayor of Derby set up a flood fund and a souvenir booklet costing 6d, was produced by the YMCA to raise money for those who houses and businesses had been affected. Damage to the town was estimated at ¬£400,000. (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). Flood relief culverts Northern Flood Relief Culvert showing the intersection of the tunnels from the Markeaton and Mackworth brooks Following the floods of 1931 and 1932, the Borough council arranged for an investigation to be carried out into the flooding problem within the catchment. The planned solution was the construction of two flood relief culverts, with associated improvements to the sewerage system. Opened in 1938, the largest of the diversion tunnels was called the Northern Flood Relief Culvert, and drains excess flows from the Markeaton and Mackworth brooks. The second, known as the Bramble brook culvert takes surplus flows for that tributary stream. The northern relief culvert commences at Markeaton Park, near to the confluence of the Markeaton and Mackworth brooks. Each brook has its own inlet spillway, with a weir that overflows during periods of high flows. Flows from these inlets converge, and are then taken by the relief culvert eastwards for 2.2 km through the suburbs of Derby, to an outfall with the Derwent in Darley Park. In 2006, the inlet works were improved and upgraded to cope with changes in the catchment that have occurred since the original design. Wildlife and ecology The brook and its tributaries supports a range of flora and fauna, and includes two protected areas of ecological importance at Muggington Bottoms and Kedleston Hall. Rare freshwater sponges, and the endangered native white clawed crayfish have been found in the brook. Projects and groups Since 2004, the catchments of the Mercaston & Markeaton brooks have been included in a multi-agency project designed to reduce sediment runoff in the catchment, restore hedgerows, and tackle invasive species such as American mink and Himalayan balsam. Taking part in the project are the Friends of the Markeaton Brook, an advocate group which aims to protect the brook and its surroundings, and educate the public on its history, amenities and nature.

In 1998, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on Yanni's album Tribute. Juengling has worked on a number of large productions as a lighting and media programmer, 3-D effects artist, and visual effects artist with an emphasis in lighting. These have included lighting for large buildings, music performances, movies, and Broadway shows. Projects One of Juengling's earlier projects included the 1997 Batman & Robin film, where he worked as an assistant lighting director. Following Batman & Robin, in 1998 Juengling was nominated along with Lee Rose for an Emmy for Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) For A Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries or Movie for his work on Yanni's production of Yanni: Tribute. The tribute included scenes from the Taj Mahal and the Forbidden City, which gave Juengling the opportunity to display his work in other countries. Another high-profile project for a large-scale building Juengling was involved in was being on the design team for the release of the Empire State Building's new lighting as of 2012. The lighting is 50% more efficient than before, can be started at the stroke of a button and contains over 16 million colors. The ESB partnered with the Macy's Fireworks Spectacular for their 37th Fourth of July fireworks show, unveiling the ESB lighting project for the first time. Juengling partnered with Marc Brickman to create a 3D projection landscape from the provided artwork for a Cat Stevens comeback performance. Juengling stated: \\"We started with Dogan's illustrations, made digital files of them and broke each one up into three separate layers, at all times thinking of what would look best either upstage or downstage. We then had to paint in the missing areas of the imagery because the original artwork was more square in shape than the 2:1 ratio projection surface. The individual layers are then re-blended by Oz to form a single image with a 3D effect. In some songs we add an extra layer of animation with leaves, rain or snow falling to create even more of a magical feel. All of this imagery is loaded on to three PRG Mbox EXtreme media servers with each of them able to produce two outputs that feed six Barco 20kW projectors positioned at a very steep angle.\\" In addition to Yanni and Cat Stevens, Juengling has worked with musical group The Rascals as well. Personal life Juengling lives in an affluent neighborhood of San Bernardino, California with his wife and their children. He is the son of German immigrant Paul Franz J√ºngling (anglicized as Juengling upon arrival to the States) and his second wife Cherie Tucker.

Early life John Rochfort was born in London, England, the youngest son of Frank senior, a goldsmith, silversmith and jeweller, and Sarah (n√©e Button). He was one of nine children born between 1818 and 1837. His older brother James, born in 1830, was a qualified architect and surveyor who was employed for seven years at a large practice in London under an architect who was also the district surveyor of St James‚Äôs, Westminster. John followed James into the profession, and by the age of nineteen when he first left for New Zealand he was qualified to work as a surveyor and draughtsman. Visit to New Zealand John and James Rochfort arrived in New Zealand in February 1852 on the Marmora. The Marmora stopped at Lyttelton for ten days and then took them to Wellington. When they disembarked, James realised that he wouldn‚Äôt find work as an architect so departed for Sydney. John found work as a surveyor, but the pay was so low that he decided to go to the goldfields in Victoria. After quitting his job, John walked across the Rimutaka Range to Port Ahuriri (Napier) through the bush just to experience more of the country. He sailed from Ahuriri to Wellington, and departed for Melbourne on the barque Napoleon in July 1852. Before leaving New Zealand, the Napoleon put in at Nelson, which made a good impression on him and no doubt influenced his decision to later emigrate there. Emigration to New Zealand After several months on the Victorian Goldfields, where he met up and spent some time gold mining with his older brother Joseph, John decided to return to New Zealand. However, while in Melbourne he received word (probably that his father was seriously ill), so instead returned to England. Following the death of Frank senior in August 1853, John, his mother Sarah, and siblings Mary Dorothy, Frank junior, James and Augusta emigrated to New Zealand. They arrived in Nelson in December 1854. The family soon established themselves in the province, where Frank had a store on Haven Road in Port Nelson, and Sarah, Frank and James had a sawmill and a farm called Knowle Wood in the Riwaka Valley, on the western side of Tasman Bay. However, by the end of 1858 the farm, sawmill and store had all been taken by creditors to pay off their debts. John was referred to as living at Haven Road and Riwaka, employed as a surveyor, but was not financially invested in the family businesses.  Professional life In 1855 John Rochfort became an approved surveyor, contracting work for the Nelson provincial survey department. His work took him to Golden Bay in the west of the province and to the Sounds in the east. By 1858 he was living in the Sounds, advertising for private work as well as tendering for Government contracts. In 1859 he won the contract to survey Nelson‚Äôs portion of the West Coast. The West Coast survey lasted from February 1859 till August 1860, and was notable especially for the discovery of gold in the Buller River in November 1859. After the completion of the West Coast survey Rochfort spent a short time at the Waimangaroa diggings just north of the Buller. In late 1861 he explored a route from the Grey Valley on the West Coast to the Hanmer Plain on the East Coast via the Amuri Pass. He held off giving details of the discovery until the Provincial Government promised him payment. Afterwards he was hired to make a track along the route, and at about that time he became employed full time as an assistant provincial surveyor. In 1864 Rochfort left the Nelson provincial survey department and became an assistant provincial surveyor for Canterbury instead. He spent most of the year engaged on Canterbury‚Äôs portion of the West Coast, where he witnessed a large influx of population as several gold rushes took place. During 1865 his work on the West Coast included laying out the town of Greymouth. By the end of 1865 he was living in Halswell near Christchurch, where he continued working for the Canterbury Provincial Government until 1869. Afterwards he opened a soap making factory, which he ran for about six months until returning to Nelson. In 1870 he was contracted by the General Government to select a line in the Rimutaka Range north of Wellington for the Napier to Wellington Railway. In 1873 he was then employed to survey the route he had selected. Later that year he was contracted by the General Government to make a flying survey from Foxhill in Nelson through the rugged country to Brunnerton near Greymouth for a proposed railway line. In 1874 Rochfort became the engineer for the Timaru and Gladstone Board of Works in South Canterbury. He was employed there until 1876, when the department was dissolved due to the abolition of the provinces. Afterwards he returned to Nelson, where he established a private practice and was variously employed on jobs for Road Boards or mining companies. In 1882 Rochfort was contracted by the General Government to survey a route for the proposed Main Trunk Line between Wellington and Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The survey involved great danger, crossing through territory of supporters of the Maori King who did not want the railway passing through their land. He later recalled, ‚ÄúI met with continual native obstruction, was many times stopped, once a prisoner for eight days, and twice fired upon.‚Äù Rochfort had initially left his Nelson business temporarily, but having completed the survey at the end of 1884, he was employed as an engineer to form the Main Trunk Line. He sold his business and made his move to the North Island permanent, despite his family staying in Nelson. He worked for the Public Works Department until 1888, when it was merged with the Railway Department and he was made redundant. Afterwards he based himself in Kihikihi near Te Awamutu, where he contracted surveys for the Native Land Court.  Family and death In 1863 Rochfort married Mary Elizabeth Hackett. She remained in Nelson while he was surveying on the West Coast for Canterbury Province, but he completed his work in time for the birth of their daughter in September 1864. Mary died of an inflammation of the lungs six days after the birth. In 1867 he married Amelia Susan Lewis. She was the daughter of Henry Lewis, a former colleague at the Nelson Provincial survey department, and was thirteen years his junior. Their first son was born at Halswell in Canterbury the following year. Over the next nine years they had five daughters, born in the various places where the family had moved with Rochfort's employment. Their youngest child, a son, was born in Nelson in 1878. Based at Kihikihi from about 1887, Rochfort probably had a de facto wife. She was a local Maori woman of high enough standing to expect a parcel of land during a ruling from the Native Land Court. They built a house on the land, but when the settlement of 200 acres didn‚Äôt come through, they were left with just a few acres, which was barely enough to support the house. Rochfort died in 1893 of heart disease. He was employed at the time surveying near Kihikihi for the Native Land Court. He returned to town for a few days to get fresh supplies, ate a meal at the Star Hotel, and died seated in the parlour. He was 60 years old.

He received a PhD degree from the University of Trnava in 2004 and became an associate professor there in 2005.  Legal career  After graduating from his first tenure at Yale, Proch√°zka worked as a lawyer in the Prague branch of the law firm Hogan & Hartson from 1998 to 1999. From 2001 until 2004 he worked as an adviser and a consultant at the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic, at the same time he served as a legal counsel to the Slovak delegation to the European Commission. When Slovakia joined the European Union in 2004 he became the first representative of the State before he served as Slovakia's first representative to the European Court of Justice. He resigned from the justice ministry in 2006, when the highly controversial ≈†tefan Harabin was appointed Minister of Justice by prime minister Robert Fico.  Political career  In 2010, he was first elected to the Slovak parliament, the National Council of Slovakia while he was a member of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). During his first years in parliament, Proch√°zka gained a reputation for being a maverick, breaking with party ranks on several occasions. One notable example was in February 2011 when he voted in favour of the opposition Citizen Act when banned the holding of dual citizenship. This caused fury within his own party, and coalition allies called for his expulsion. Proch√°zka who, along with Daniel Lip≈°ic and Jana ≈Ωit≈àansk√° was regarded by observers as the leaders of the party's ‚Äòyoung wing‚Äô authored in October 2012 the so-called 'Alfa- platform'. In this doctrine, he called for the total abolition of payroll taxes, installing a single social benefit payment, the financing of basic health care from taxes and a constitutional ban on public finance deficit over a period of a single electoral term. Before the parliamentary election in 2012, Proch√°zka, despite being one of the most popular KDH politicians was not offered a significant nomination, and in February 2013 he officially left the party, continuing in parliament as an independent. The party had refused to discuss or implement the changes he had proposed within his Alfa platform. After the meeting, Proch√°zka said he would never again run on the KDH slate. = 2014 presidential election = He was a candidate in the 2014 Slovak presidential election, but did came in third with 21%, behind Robert Fico and Andrej Kiska, thus he did not make it to the second and final round. In late March 2014, he announced that he would give up his parliamentary seat, after the May parliamentary session. He said he was ready to found a new political party and has a network of people who will join in the project. = Leader of Siet' = In the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election, Prochazka founded, along with Andrej Hrnƒçiar and Miroslav Beblavy a new political party called Siet' (Slovak: Network), He was officially elected leader of the party on 2 September of that year. = Parliamentary elections = Political party SIE≈§ got 5,6% in parliamentary elections, which took place on 5 March 2016, which was huge disappointment for party. = Leaving politics = Proch√°zka did not candidate for the position of the leader of Sie≈• again after the 2016 election, rather remaining a regular MP for the party. Shortly after, he announced his complete withdrawal from politics, leaving his MP seat and party membership. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the position of Judge at the CJEU. The Court reasoned that Proch√°zka was rejected due to \\"undispelled fears about his integrity\\" despite his other qualities.  Personal life  Radoslav Proch√°zka is married to civil-rights attorney Katarina Proch√°zkov√°.

Early years Jean-√âlie Gautier was born in Bordeaux, Gironde, on 6 October 1781. His father was Jean-√âlie Gautier (1743‚Äì1828), a merchant in Bordeaux who was ennobled without a title by Louis XVIII of France in 1816. His mother was Marie-Emilie Laffon. The family was Protestant. After completing his secondary education Gautier entered his father's business. He was a member of the General Council of the Gironde department from 1824 to 1829, from 1831 to 1833 and from 1839 to 1847. He was elected a deputy for Bordeaux on 25 February 1824, and sat with the majority. He participated in debates on financial issues, and was often the rapporteur of the budget. He was reelected on 17 November 1827, having sided against the press law, and sat with the liberal opposition. He was reelected in June 1830. July Monarchy Gautier was elected President of the Commercial Court of Bordeaux from 1830 to 1832. He lost his seat as a deputy in July 1831. He was President of the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce from 1831 to 1833. He became a member of the Board of Trade and Industry in 1832. On 11 October 1832 King Louis Philippe I made him a Peer of France. In the Upper House, he was noted for his skill in financial and business matters. In 1833 he was appointed deputy governor of the Bank of France under Barbe Marbois as governor. He remained in this post until his death. Caricature of Gautier as Minister of Finance (La Mode, 6 April 1839) After elections early in 1839 which caused the second cabinet of Louis Mathieu Mol√© to resign, Louis Philippe could not form a ministry that would be able to obtain support of the majority of deputies. On 31 March 1839 he formed a transitional cabinet of technicians, with no president, in which Gautier was Minister of Finance. Since the post was temporary, Gautier did not initiate any important actions, apart from presenting the draft laws and budget prepared by his predecessor Jean Lacave-Laplagne. On 12 May 1839 he and his cabinet colleagues retired and a new cabinet was formed under Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult following an insurrection in Paris. Until the February Revolution of 1848 Gautier continued to sit in the house of peers and to act as Deputy Governor of the Bank of France and member of the Board of Commerce and Industry. He was also Chairman of the Committee of invalids of the Navy. Later years After the February Revolution Gautier lost his posts other than Deputy Governor of the Bank of France. He remained out of politics under the Second Republic, other than publishing a manifesto in 1851 that showed he was clearly aligned with the \\"party of order\\". After the coup d'√©tat of December 2, 1851, on 26 January 1852 he was appointed to the Senate, remaining a senator in the Second Empire. The next year he again became a member of the Board of Trade and Industry. Gautier was also a member of the consistory of Paris, president of the Central Council of Reformed Churches and Commander of the Legion of Honor from 30 May 1837.

Peer counseling for seniors, provides senior citizens with a trained volunteer counselor to provide assistance with emotional support and encouragement to those who are experiencing life changes that often accompany aging. Seniors typically use counseling to discover ways to deal with grief, loss, physical limitations, financial issues, mild depression, family relationships, loneliness, isolation, housing situations, anxiety, change in cognitive function, and care giving for a spouse.  Origin  The original idea of Senior Peer Counseling was developed in 1977 by Evelyn Freeman, Ph.D. (1917‚Äì2013). She first created a program called Senior Health and Peer Counseling of Santa Monica, California. In 1986 in collaboration with others, she produced \\"Peer Counseling for Seniors: A Trainer's Guide\\". As a result, various groups utilized her trainer's guide and Senior Peer Counseling programs became available in many California counties as well as in South Carolina, Colorado, Oregon, New Mexico, and Washington. The program is also available in Europe, Canada, and Japan. Sponsorship of the program in those locations comes from county health services, interfaith councils, senior citizen advocacy groups, and non-profit organizations. These Senior Peer Counseling programs vary widely in their methods, and no one program is alike. However, they all operate in the spirit of Evelyn Freeman's vision of Senior Peer Counseling. In addition, even though no two programs are exactly alike, there is an organization called the American Association of Senior Peer Counseling that tries to bring together all of the various Senior Peer Counseling agencies to share opportunities for networking and information.  Program design characteristics  In general, Senior Peer Counseling volunteers are trained to provide one-on-one, (counselor and client) confidential counseling to other persons 50 years of age or older. The counseling sessions are goal-oriented or supportive and are in general one hour per week. The sessions are held in the client's home, a senior citizen center, or another confidential setting and are closely supervised by professionals, i.e., psychologists, marriage and family therapists, or social workers, who intervene, as appropriate, with suggestions about how to handle situations with clients or to provide resources. Confidentiality is only broken in exceptional circumstances, such as when there is suspected child or elder abuse or when the client reports he or she is at risk of suicide, homicide, or grave disability. In these events, counselings have specific reporting instructions to assure the safety of everyone concerned. Referrals to Senior Peer Counseling programs are often made by Adult Protective Services agencies, home health workers, hospitals, social workers, registered nurses, senior housing, or other agencies serving senior citizens. Elders may become aware of the program through postings in senior citizen centers, senior housing, or other agencies serving senior citizens, and may self-refer into the program.  Effectiveness  Seniors counseling can maybe be effective because the counselors often have had life experiences similar to their clients. In contrast, professional counselors may unintentionally create a power imbalance with older clients unfamiliar with formal counseling and many senior clients will not seek formal counseling due to cost or perceived stigma. Senior peer counseling programs, therefore, may provide a more comfortable and supportive environment for the client. In 2010‚Äì2011, Applied Survey Research (ASR) conducted a study of 43 senior peer counseling clients in San Mateo County, California. The study concluded that the clients had discussed personal issues in their lives more often with their senior peer counselors than with anyone else including family, friends, and neighbors. The study also found that 75% of the clients had reported the senior peer counseling had \\"helped a lot\\", especially with their concerns about food, health, loneliness, and sadness. Twenty-three percent reported it had \\"helped a little bit\\" and 3% reported it \\"had not helped at all\\".

He was the lead funeral director and embalmer for the state funerals of George H. W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, and has coordinated and directed some of the most visible funerals in recent history for a variety of well-known politicians, cabinet members, business leaders, entertainers and clergy. With a career spanning nearly five decades, Boetticher has become a renowned figure in the death care industry. He is currently the AVP to the Founder and Chairman Emeritus of Service Corporation International and President and CEO of LHT Consulting Group, He is also a nationally known speaker and lecturer, movie and television consultant and contributing writer for industry publications.  Early life  Boetticher was born in Santa Monica, California to Henry Edward Boetticher,(1924 ‚Äì 2004), an entrepreneur, and Patricia Jean Boetticher (1923 - 2011), a homemaker and community volunteer. Boetticher and his older brother, William Edward (1944 - ), were raised in Brentwood, a suburb of Los Angeles. Boetticher knew from an early age that he wanted to pursue a career in funeral service. He graduated high school from Army and Navy Academy in Carlsbad, California in 1965, then later enrolled at the California College of Mortuary Science to become a licensed embalmer and funeral director.  Military service  During the Vietnam War, Boetticher was drafted by the U.S. Army and was forced to leave his studies at the mortuary college as well as positions with a local funeral home Armstrong Family Mortuary and Goodhew Ambulance Company in Los Angeles, California . He was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana for Basic Training and then made the decision to enlist for an additional year to attend the U.S. Army's Grave Registration School at Army Mortuary System Europe in Prince George County, Virginia. After completion of Grave Reservation School in 1966, Boetticher received orders to be assigned to an Infantry Regiment and then transferred to a Medic Mobilized Unit in Augsburg, Germany. Being a funeral director and apprentice embalmer, he was then reassigned to the Army Mortuary Affairs System Europe in Frankfurt, Germany, where he served as a supply sergeant and embalmer. Boetticher was honorably discharged in 1970 as a Sergeant First Class, but remained in Frankfurt, working for the U.S. Army PX system until his return to United States in 1970 with his wife and son Bob, Jr.  Career  After his return to the Santa Monica, California in 1970, Boetticher wanted to explore a career in the film industry working alongside his uncle, Budd Boetticher (1916-2001), a well-known movie director. But in need of steady employment for his growing family, he turned back to his lifelong ambitions in funeral service. He accepted a job at Gates Kingsley & Gates Mortuary in Santa Monica, California as an embalmer and funeral director. The firm was owned by Mark Gates and Virgle Kingsley and was acquired by SCI shortly thereafter in 1970, marking Boetticher's first position with the funeral service giant. He then graduated from the California College of Mortuary Science now known as Cypress College in 1971. In 1974, Boetticher and his wife, Jarka, purchased a funeral home and flower shop in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he was elected Teton County Coroner, for Teton County, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Teton National Park, and Yellowstone National Park. He was a founding member of the Wyoming Coroner's Association who was the force behind the development of the Coroner Basic Course at the Wyoming Law Enforcement Acadeny now manadated by Wyoming State Statute. Boetticher was a member of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners. He went on to later purchase three other funeral homes throughout Wyoming and also held offices and received awards in local, national and state organizations. In 1983, he rejoined SCI and relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, where he served in a variety of field funeral and cemetery operations and also served on the Board of Directors of the Kansas City Kansas Community College ‚Äì Mortuary Science. He relocated to SCI headquarters in Houston, Texas in 1991, heading several departments and was temporarily reassigned to London, England in 1994 to assist with the company's merchandising efforts with newly acquired funeral homes. Boetticher's work has also contributed to technological innovations in death care. As concerns began to mount surrounding the safety of funeral professionals involved in embalming procedures, Boetticher worked as Project Manager for the research and development of a new embalming fluid, Infinity 2000, a phenol- and formaldehyde-free fluid that required no special safety precautions and was non-irritating to the embalmer's eyes and skin. Infinity 2000 also, unlike formaldehyde, allows organs to retain their natural color, which is of use in teaching at medical schools. Since 1993, Boetticher has been Vice-Chairman/CEO and on May 22, 2018 was elected Chairman of the Board of the National Museum of Funeral History, a 35,000 sq. ft. facility located in Houston which houses the country's largest collection of funeral service artifacts. He has also served as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Regents for the Commonwealth Institute of Funeral Service since 1993. In 2014, Boetticher became President of The Heritage Club - National Funeral Director's Association, a charitable group that funds and supports educational endeavors in the funeral service industry. Boetticher is a familiar speaker on the History of Presidential State Funerals at industry conferences and events, with past appearances at the Wilbert, Inc. annual meeting in Santa Fe, NM in 1996; the Tri State Funeral Directors Convention in Kansas City, MO in 2005; the New York Funeral Directors Convention in Saratoga, NY in 2011; the South Carolina Funeral Directors Association Mid-Winter Conference & Expo in Columbia, SC in 2012; the Rochester Funeral Directors Meeting in Rochester, NY in 2013; the Southern Funeral Service Expo in Macon, GA, the Oklahoma Funeral Directors Convention in Tulsa, OK, and the Erie-Niagara Funeral Directors association in Amherst, NY in 2015. In 2016, Boetticher spoke at the Idaho Funeral Service Association Convention in McCall, ID; appeared twice in engagements at the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science in Cincinnati, OH, including delivery of the commencement address; and was also a featured speaker at the Southeastern Family Office Forum in Atlanta, GA, presenting on the topic, \\"Preparing for the Inevitable: The role of the family office when there is a death.‚Äù In 2017, Boetticher spoke to the Funeral Directors of Kentucky in Louisville, KY and Alabama Funeral Directors in Mobile, Alabama. In January, 2019 he spoke to the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI in Houston, Texas, the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science, Cincinniti, Ohio in February 2019. He spoke in May 2019 at the 139th Annual Convention of the Indiana Funeral Directors Association Convention and in June, 2019 at the 139th Ohio Funeral Directors Association Convention in Columbus, Ohio and the Louisiana and Mississippi joint Funeral Directors Convention, New Orleans, LA. He made a presentation on state funerals at the Georgia Funeral Directors Association on June 11, 2019. In print media, Boetticher has written four articles in the Presidential Passing's series for Southern Calls Magazine. Boetticher has also had consulting assignments for museums, production companies, radio programs and feature films, including Gangs of New York and A Woman of Independent Means. His television credits include work on Six Feet Under, the History Channel and the Discovery Channel.  Personal life  Boetticher is married to Jaroslava Rydlova Boetticher for the past 50 years, a Czech-born physical therapist, whom he met in Germany during his service with the U.S. Army.

The Bahrain Center for Human Rights has classified the widespread cultural destruction as \\"crimes of genocide under the UN Convention on Genocide (1948).\\" Extent of destruction In July 2011, Iranian media reported that at least 52 mosques and over 500 religious Shia sites had been levelled in Bahrain.‚ÄúStop destroying Bahrain‚Äôs‚Äô mosques‚Äù , Press TV, July 24, 2011/30 mosques demolished in Bahrain, cleric says , Tehran Times, July 25, 2011, Among those destroyed was the ornate 400-year-old Ottoman Amir Mohammed Braighi mosque in Aali. In Nuwaidrat, where the first anti-government protests began on February 14, only the portico of the Mo'men mosque was left standing (see left). Many others in the village were also bulldozed. One of the most famous Shia shrines which was destroyed was that belonging to Bahraini Shia spiritual leader, Sheikh Abdul Amir al-Jamri, who died in 2006. Its golden dome had been removed. Graffiti insulting the Shia was also left on some of the desecrated mosques. The Sasa'a bin Sawhan Mosque in Askar, an ancient mosque and mausoleum which dates to shortly after the death of Muhammad, was also damaged. Motivation The government of Bahrain made it clear that ‚Äúthey had engaged in dismantling structures which had been erected without legal authorisation.‚Äù However, the widespread demolitions were reprisals for Shia involvement in the protests against the ruling Sunni discrimination against their community.

Sefton broke the pole vault world record several times in 1937 and placed fourth in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Athletic career =Early career= Sefton was a good pole vaulter already in 1932, while still at Polytechnic High School. He vaulted 13 ft in (4.09 m) for a national high school record and shared first place in the California interscholastic championship meet. In 1934 he vaulted at least 14 ft (4.26 m) on four occasions, clearing 14 ft in (4.28 m) at Santa Barbara on April 28, and tied for first at the national junior championships with a new meeting record of 13 ft 6 in (4.11 m). Sefton and Earle Meadows were teammates at the University of Southern California and collectively known as the \\"Heavenly Twins\\". The two tied for first at the 1935 NCAA championship meet, both vaulting 14 ft in (4.29 m) for a new meeting record as USC won the team title. They also tied at the national championships, both clearing 13 ft in (4.22 m) to share first place. =1936= Sefton and Meadows tied at the NCAA meet again in 1936, this time vaulting 14 ft in (4.31 m) to improve their meeting record by a fraction of an inch. At the national championships George Varoff won with a new world record of 14 ft in (4.43 m) while Sefton vaulted 14 ft (4.26 m) for third. However, the Olympic trials were held separately the following week and there Varoff only placed fourth and was left off the team, while Sefton, Meadows and returning Olympian and USC graduate Bill Graber all cleared 14 ft 3 in (4.34 m) to tie for first. It was the first time one university had swept the three Olympic spots at the trials. Sefton almost failed to qualify for the Olympic final, missing twice at 3.80 m (12 ft in) in qualifying but clearing cleanly on his third attempt. In the final Meadows won with an Olympic record of 4.35 m (14 ft in) while Sefton and two Japanese vaulters, Shuhei Nishida and Sueo ≈åe, all cleared 4.25 m (13 ft in) and had an extra vault as a tie-breaker. Sefton lost the jump-off and thus finished out of the medals in fourth place. =1937= Sefton broke the world record several times in 1937. He first improved it in Los Angeles on April 10, clearing 14 ft in (4.45 m) to beat Varoff's mark from the previous year. A month later in San Francisco he cleared 14 ft (4.48 m) in a dual meet against Stanford, but Meadows equaled that height later in the same competition. Finally, in the conference meet on May 29, again in Los Angeles, Sefton vaulted 14 ft 11 in (4.54 m), clearing that height on his first attempt. Meadows, despite missing on his first two attempts, again tied the new record on his third and final try. The two were not able to attempt 15 ft (4.57 m) that day as the standards maxed out at 14 ft 11 in and the bar couldn't be raised any higher. Only these last records were officially ratified by the IAAF. Sefton finally won outright at the NCAA championships, clearing 14 ft in (4.49 m) for a meeting record and beating both Varoff and Meadows. It was only in 1951 that Don Laz of Illinois broke that record. Sefton also won the 1937 national title with a leap of 14 ft in (4.46 m), another meeting record; Dutch Warmerdam, Meadows and Varoff all cleared the same height but missed out on countback.

Life Van Straten was born in 1913 in Darien, Connecticut, the daughter of Dutch immigrants. Her mother spoke six languages and was the highest paid officer in the Netherlands before she came over to the United States. Jacques van Straten, her father, worked for the world-famous movie company, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, with its main offices located in New York City. His work for MGM often took him to foreign countries, which gave her the opportunity to travel. She spent a school year abroad, in Nice, France, where she improved her French. She was already as proficient in Dutch, German, Italian, and Spanish. Van Straten had initially wanted to be a writer, but enrolled in New York University (NYU) and earned her degree in Chemistry instead. She followed by a Master and received a PhD in physical chemistry at NYU in 1939 where she taught Chemistry until 1942. After the attack on Pearl Harbor (in December 1941), the Navy trained increasing numbers of weather personnel, including several hundred women, to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding force. In 1942 the Navy created the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) program. One of the earliest volunteers was van Straten, who was immediately assigned to the Naval Aerology Service. She was then trained as a weather forecaster at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MTI). Lt. van Straten, who had no previous military experience, spent the war at Weather Central in Washington, initially analyzing the use of weather in combat operations in the Pacific. She also wrote the report on the Marshalls‚ÄìGilberts raids, tactical airstrikes over islands in Micronesia. The purpose of the reports was to ‚Äúform a basis for a better understanding of the applications of weather information to future operations.‚Äù Later, van Straten transferred to the R & D section, where she worked for the rest of the war on radar and other new technologies. By 1943, van Straten had been assigned to the headquarters staff, the Aerology section of the Bureau of Aeronautics, where she worked in the Operational Analysis Section. Here she compiled extensive analyses of the effects of weather on naval operations, from both historical sources and more recent naval actions. In 1946, she became a civilian adviser to the Chief of Naval Operations. After the war, van Straten continued to work for the Naval Weather Service as a civilian atmospheric physicist where her analytical work on the conditions of the upper atmosphere assisted in the development of long- range missile technology. From 1948 to 1962, she headed the technical requirements section, describing her position as the ‚Äúapplication of environmental factors to military operations.‚Äù In 1958 she was named the ‚ÄòWoman of the Year‚Äô by the women‚Äôs wing of the Aero Medical Society of America. She retired in 1962 after 16 years as head of the technical requirements branch of the Naval Weather Service, but continued as a consultant to the Navy on atmospheric physics until 1973. She died of cancer at the age of 78, on March 25, 1992, at her home in Bethesda, Maryland. Research contributions Van Straten's reports provided examples of how military forces were able to use weather conditions to their advantage, but they also provided examples in which the weather was ignored, to the detriment of the participants. The battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 was such an instance. The American fleet used the clouds and precipitation of a trailing frontal system to provide cover, slipping out to attack the exposed Japanese naval force and then disappearing again into the heavy weather. In this way they were able to sink the Japanese aircraft carrier Sh≈çh≈ç, seriously damaged another carrier, and shoot down numerous enemy planes. But when they departed the frontal zone to operate in fair weather, they immediately lost the carrier . Van Straten helped develop methods of using weather phenomena, such as storms, in the planning of ship maneuvers and carrier-based airplane flights. Her work also included development of a technique to modify clouds and produce rain by injecting carbon black into the atmosphere. As a weather trouble- shooter for the Navy, she dealt with problems ranging from fog to radioactive fallout. She also developed a radar facsimile system and patented a sonic device for preventing ice buildup on planes. She was instrumental in the development of the rocketsonde, which launched a data-collecting package, called a radiosonde, into the upper atmosphere. It was at her suggestion that meteorological data be used in planning the trajectory of rocket launches. She also developed the constant-altitude weather balloon. The deflated balloon was carried aloft by a bubble of helium. The balloon inflated as the atmosphere became thinner until it was full, at which point its altitude remained constant. She also contributed to the development of the floating weather station the Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device (NOMAD). She also contributed to the development of the weather instrument shelter, that protects sensitive instruments from the elements, and the tipping bucket rain gauge which tipped with every 1/100 inch of precipitation and automatically recorded the action at the station.

Before that he was head of the church's Committee on Publication in New York, and a trustee for ten years of the estate of Mary Baker Eddy (1821‚Äì1910), the founder of the church. Dittemore is best known as the co-author, with Ernest Sutherland Bates, of Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition (1932). Biography Dittemore was born in Indianapolis to Mary E. Cress Dittemore and John W. Dittemore. He attended Ohio Military Institute and Phillips Academy Andover. After graduating he became president of the Federal Packing Company and vice-president of the Van Camp Packing Company.Who Was Who in America, cited in Thompson, Donald Eugene. (1974). Indiana Authors and Their Books 1917-1966. Wabash College. p. 169 =Christian Science church involvement= Dittemore became known for his involvement with The First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, the mother church and administrative headquarters of the Christian Science religion. As head of the church's Committee on Publication, Dittemore commissioned The Life of Mary Baker Eddy by Sibyl Wilbur, the first church-authorized biography of the religion's founder, Mary Baker Eddy, which was based on articles written by Wilbur for Human Life magazine. However, when he later became critical of Christian Science, he called the book unreliable. As part of his role in the church, he collected a significant amount of primary-source material about the church and Eddy. In 1909 he was named to the church's Board of Directors.Dittemore, John V. (1932). Truth and the Tradition, iv. Dittemore was removed from his position as a Director over a dispute regarding the Trustees of the Christian Science Publishing Society. He had become increasingly bitter in the months of disagreement and opposed any effort by the Board of Directors to restore normal relations with the Trustees and to keep the church from being drawn into litigation with them. His bitterness was directed not only at the Trustees, but the other Directors, and, according to Norman Beasley, \\"his criticism was sharply personal, and openly contemptuous,\\" leading to his dismissal in March of 1919.Beasley, Norman (1957). The Continuing Spirit. Allen & Unwin, 151-154 He was replaced by Annie M. Knott, the first woman Director of the church.\\"Asks court to oust Eddy publishers\\", The New York Times, 10 April 1919. The resolution of dismissal also accused Dittemore of working independently and contrarily to the Board to exert personal control over the affairs of the church, violating multiple Manual by-laws, and acting in a threatening manner towards other members of the Board. In the same resolution he was told to \\"return to the Clerk of the Mother Church and Corresponding Secretary of [the] Board all letters, documents, papers, copies thereof, and other articles which he has taken or received as a member of this Board\\". On April 29, 1919, about six weeks after his dismissal, Dittemore sued the church to be reinstated; and although he was not successful, litigation went on for some time.Beasley 1957, 165 After failing twice in court, he set up his own organization which he later called an \\"opposition movement, opposed to the Cause of Christian Science, [and] to Mrs. Eddy and her teachings.\\"Beasley 1957, 190-191, 376-377 According to Dittemore in the preface to The Truth and the Tradition, he came to the view in 1928 that Eddy's work had borrowed heavily from the unpublished manuscripts of New England \\"mental healer\\" Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. He also said he was concerned with the alleged church boycott of Charles Scribner's Sons for publishing a critical biography of Eddy, Edwin Dakin's Mrs. Eddy: The Biography of a Virginal Mind (1929). Gill writes that the \\"alleged campaign... was... probably the single most important factor in assuring its long-term success\\" and Charles Scribner's Sons used it to advertise for the book, including ads like one in the Los Angeles Times saying that booksellers across America were returning Dakin's book under pressure, and further that it was a \\"situation almost incredible in a free country.\\"Duffield, William (20 December 1929). \\"Mrs. Eddy: The Biography of a Virginal Mind\\" (letter to the editor). California and Western Medicine. 20 December 1929. Although the book was extremely successful, Gill write that its \\"wealth of factual errors\\" in addition to its commercial success, may have been motivating factors for Dittemore to write his own book. =Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition= In 1932, Dittemore wrote his own biography of Eddy and history of the church, Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition, with Ernest Sutherland Bates, a teacher of English and philosophy at Oberlin College; a collaborate suggested by Allen Johnson, Professor of American History at Yale University. The book was largely based on the three trunks full of primary sources that Dittemore collected while working for the church, including 1,500 unpublished letters from Eddy; what he noted as \\"all the important part[s]\\" of the diary of Eddy's personal assistant Calvin Frye; the diary of James F. Gilman, who illustrated her work; letters from her brother and first two husbands; 500 letters from her students; and reminiscences from her close contacts. Gillian Gill writes that Dittemore, when he broke with the church, in addition to taking many documents acquired over the years by the church, gained access to Frye's rooms in the hours after his death and removed sections of his diary, which Dittemore transcribed, photographed, and then burned; although he included extracts in his book. He later sold some of the materials back to the church for $10,000, after first allowing Gilbert Carpenter, another biographer, to copy them for $400.Gill, Gillian (1998). Mary Baker Eddy. Perseus Books, 575-579. The work also makes use of two books that Dittemore says were suppressed by the church: Mrs. Eddy as I Knew Her in 1870 (1923) by Samuel Putnam Bancroft, a student of Eddy's, and Mrs. Eddy and the Late Suit in Equity (1908) by Michael Meehan. The latter is about a lawsuit in which Eddy was involved toward the end of her life, when her relatives sought unsuccessfully to have her declared unable to manage her affairs. Meehan was a journalist who wrote favorably of Eddy, and she initially approved the publication but later asked the author not to release it, although he ended up self-publishing it.Meehan, Michael (1908). Mrs. Eddy and the Late Suit in Equity. Concord, NH. Another edition is entitled Mrs. Eddy and Next Friends. Historian Ralph Henry Gabriel wrote in 1933 that, because of the amount of primary-source material to which Dittemore had access, the book \\"comes very close to being a definitive history of a strangely paradoxical woman\\". Gill writes that by publishing previously unpublished material and correcting many of the inaccuracies in Milmine and Dakin's books, Bates and Dittemore \\"improves upon all earlier works and becomes invaluable source material for later biographers in its accounts of the last five or so years of Mrs. Eddy's life\\" in particular, although she notes there are still \\"factual inaccuracies\\" in the book. Later, the church bought the copyright and publisher's plates of the book from A. A. Knopf, but has never reissued it, leading to accusations of suppression.Braden, Charles S. (1958). Christian Science Today: Power, Policy, Practice. Southern Methodist University Press, 384‚Äì385, cited in Gill 1998, 579. =Apology= On March 23, 1937, shortly before his death, Dittemore wrote a letter to the Board of Directors of the Mother Church expressing repentance for his actions: Personal life Dittemore married Edith L. Bingham in 1898, who later divorced him. He was survived by his one daughter, Louise, and a grandson. Works *Dittemore, John V. (1925).

Comparators are closely related to operational amplifiers, but a comparator is designed to operate with positive feedback and with its output saturated at one power rail or the other. An op-amp can be pressed into service as a poorly performing comparator if necessary, but its slew rate will be impaired.  Comparator  :200px Bistable output that indicates which of the two inputs has a higher voltage. That is, : V_{\\\\text{out}} = \\\\begin{cases} V_{\\\\text{S}+} & \\\\text{if } V_1 > V_2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_{\\\\text{S}-} & \\\\text{if } V_1 < V_2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } V_1 = V_2, \\\\end{cases} where V_{\\\\text{S}+} and V_{\\\\text{S}-} are nominally the positive and negative supply voltages (which are not shown in the diagram).  Threshold detector  Circuit diagram for threshold detector with hysteresis The threshold detector with hysteresis consists of an operational amplifier and a series of resistors that provide hysteresis. Like other detectors, this device functions as a voltage switch, but with an important difference. The state of the detector output is not directly affected by input voltage, but instead by the voltage drop across its input terminals (here, referred to as Va). From Kirchhoff's Current Law, this value depends both on Vin and the output voltage of the threshold detector itself, both multiplied by a resistor ratio. :V_a={R_1 \\\\over {R_1 + R_2}}V_{in} + {R_5 \\\\over {R_1 + R_2}}V_{THRout} Unlike the zero crossing detector, the detector with hysteresis does not switch when Vin is zero, rather the output becomes Vsat+ when Va becomes positive and Vsat- when Va becomes negative. Further examination of the Va equation reveals that Vin can exceed zero (positive or negative) by a certain magnitude before the output of the detector is caused to switch. By adjusting the value of R1, the magnitude of Vin that will cause the detector to switch can be increased or decreased. Hysteresis is useful in various applications. It has better noise immunity than the level detector, so it is used in interface circuits. Its positive feedback has a faster transition, so it is used in timing applications such as frequency counters. It is also used in astable multivibrators found in instruments such as function generators.  Zero crossing detector  A zero crossing detector is a comparator with the reference level set at zero. It is used for detecting the zero crossings of AC signals. It can be made from an operational amplifier with an input voltage at its positive input . When the input voltage is positive, the output voltage is a positive value, when the input voltage is negative, the output voltage is a negative value. The magnitude of the output voltage is a property of the operational amplifier and its power supply. Applications include converting an analog signal into a form suitable to use for frequency measurements, in phase locked loops, or for controlling power electronics circuits that must switch with a defined relationship to an alternating current waveform. This detector exploits the property that the instantaneous frequency of an FM wave is approximately given by f_i=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2} where \\\\Delta t is the time difference between adjacent zero crossings of FM wave Elliott Sound Products Application Notes : Zero Crossing Detectors and Comparators  Schmitt trigger  A bistable multivibrator implemented as a comparator with hysteresis. 300px In this configuration, the input voltage is applied through the voltage divider formed by {R_1} and {R_2} (which may be the source internal resistance) to the non- inverting input and the inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is non-inverting and the switching thresholds are \\\\pm \\\\frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{\\\\text{sat}} where V_{\\\\text{sat}} is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier. 300px Alternatively, the input source and the ground may be swapped. Now the input voltage is applied directly to the inverting input and the non-inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is inverting and the switching thresholds are \\\\pm \\\\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} V_{\\\\text{sat}}. Such a configuration is used in the relaxation oscillator shown below.  Relaxation oscillator  300px By using an RC network to add slow negative feedback to the inverting Schmitt trigger, a relaxation oscillator is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to oscillate in an endless symmetric square wave (i.e., the Schmitt trigger in this configuration is an astable multivibrator).

The DCFTAs are part of each country's EU Association Agreement. They allow Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine access to the European Single Market in selected sectors and grant EU investors in those sectors the same regulatory environment in the associated country as in the EU. The agreements with Moldova and Georgia have been ratified and officially entered into force in July 2016, although parts of them were already provisionally applied. The agreement with Ukraine was provisionally applied since 1 January 2016 and formally entered into force on 1 September 2017. Unlike standard free trade areas, the DCFTA is aimed to offer the associated country the \\"four freedoms\\" of the EU Single Market: free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. Movement of people however, is in form of visa-free regime for short stay travel, while movement of workers remains within the remit of the EU Member States.http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/ukraine/documents/virtual_library/vademecum_en.pdf The DCFTA is an \\"example of the integration of a Non-EEA-Member into the EU Single Market\\".https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/tradoc_150981.pdf The European Parliament passed a resolution in 2014 stating that \\"in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, as well as any other European country, have a European perspective and can apply for EU membership in compliance with the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, minority rights and ensuring the rule of law\\", thus formally recognizing the possibility of a future EU membership of the three countries.

Aside from these issues, the deal was ready.Three outstanding issues remained in FTA agreement between Ukraine, EU, said Ukrainian PM, Bilaterals 31 May 2011 Despite those outstanding issues, Ukraine was ready to sign the agreement as it stood. Although it wanted stronger wording on enlargement prospects and access to the EU market for its truckers, Ukraine had more than many other candidates at the equivalent stage of the process. The finalised agreement was initialed on 19 July 2012. Ratification of the DCFTA, like the AA, has been stalled by the EU over concerns over the rule of law in Ukraine.Ukraine's jailed Tymoshenko calls off hunger strike, Kyiv Post (16 November 2012)EU leaders:Ratification of Association Agreement and DCFTA depends on settlement of Tymoshenko-Lutsenko issue, Kyiv Post (20 July 2012)Ukraine's Lutsenko jailed for 4 years (updated), Kyiv Post (27 February 2012) This includes the application of selective justice, as well as amending electoral laws. As a result, the role of Ukrainian oligarchs in sanctioning the agreement was also questioned. If Ukraine would choose the agreement, the Eurasian Economic Commission's Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia would withdraw from free trade agreements with the country, according to Russian presidential advisor Sergei Glazyev.

However, the Riga Declaration also stated that \\"constructive efforts in the trilateral consultations on EU- Ukraine DCFTA implementation (...) are important\\", which Anders √Öslund, Senior Fellow of the Atlantic Council, interpreted as meaning Russia (that has been militarily intervening in Ukraine ever since the February 2014 Revolution) would have to give consent first. According to the EaP Civil Society Forum, the EU plans, in 2017-2020 to shift the focus of its assistance for 2017‚Äì20 to the implementation of the DCFTA to ensure legislation and parameters align with EU standards.http://eap-csf.eu/wp-content/uploads/Recommendations-from- the-8th-AA-of-the-EaPCSF.pdf  Effects  The EU-Ukraine DCFTA provisionally entered into force on 1 January 2016. According to European Commission, \\"The DCFTA will offer Ukraine a framework for modernising its trade relations and for economic development by the opening of markets via the progressive removal of customs tariffs and quotas, and by an extensive harmonisation of laws, norms and regulations in various trade-related sectors, creating the conditions for aligning key sectors of the Ukrainian economy to EU standards.\\" \\"Unlike classical FTAs, it provides for both the freedom of establishment in services and non-services sectors, subject to limited reservations, and the expansion of the internal market for a set of key services sectors once Ukraine effectively implements the EU-acquis.\\" Furthermore, Ukraine is \\"granted access to the EU internal market for the sectors concerned\\", which results in \\"an unprecedented level of integration\\".  Current DCFTAs  = Georgia = = Moldova = = Ukraine =  Cancelled DCFTAs  = Armenia = * In addition to Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, Armenia was also set to sign an Association Agreement with the EU, however Armenia suddenly broke off negotiations in 2013 to pursue membership in the Russian-led Eurasian Union. Following a period of brief uncertainty between Brussels and Yerevan, bilateral negotiations resumed on restructuring the relationship between Armenia and the EU. After extensive negotiations, Armenia and the EU finalized a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement in February 2017; deepening political and economic ties between Armenia and the EU. The new Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement can be seen as a ‚Äúlite‚Äù version of the DCFTA, in which 96% of Armenian goods may enter the EU's single market with zero tariffs. As of 2019, the EU is Armenia's biggest export market. There are several political parties in Armenia which are opposed to Armenia's current membership in the Eurasian Union. Bright Armenia, the Free Democrats and the European Party of Armenia for example, support Armenia's withdrawal from the Eurasian Union and wish to begin renegotiating a full Association Agreement/DCFTA between the EU and Armenia.

It was released as the album's lead promotional single on March 28, 2014, by Universal/Mercury Classics as a digital download only. Recording and release Trouble's Lament was announced by Amos on March 27 to be the first song available from the album. Cover art was released on Amos' social media sites the same day, along with the album's complete track list. Musically, the song is influenced by different musical styles, including Americana, folk music, Flamenco and pop music. Amos' piano playing is accompanied by acoustic guitar and sparse percussion. The instrumentation is similar to the music of Neko Case, Patty Griffin, Fleetwood Mac and Amos' own past production on the predominantly acoustic Scarlet's Walk (2002). The song's lyrics finds Amos stating that \\"Trouble needs a home\\" after having left Satan behind, and sings about welcoming Danger into her life. Of the song's style and background, Amos (who is originally from North Carolina) stated that her Southern roots were influential: \\"It's really in the blood. It's almost like you listen to the land speaking to you. And wherever I am I can hear the South calling me. I really like the idea that trouble was a young woman....I see her on my travels a lot. And maybe I knew her many years ago when I was in my twenties.\\" Musicians: * Tori Amos, piano and vocals. * Mac Aladdin, acoustic guitar. Personnel: * Music and lyrics by Tori Amos. * Produced by Tori Amos. * Mixed and mastered by Mark Hawley and Marcel van Limbeek. Music video The accompanying music video was shot on location in London, featuring Amos in a diner in Islington. At points in the video three young women (with the help of a young gay male waiter) come into the diner and provide distractions to steal data and files from two businessmen. Their tactics include spilling coffee on one man and having the waiter flirt with the other. They also interact with Amos' character who watches from a nearby table. The end shot shows Amos handing the three women new passports as they sit in the back of her car. On April 18, Amos shared behind-the-scenes snapshots of the production, showing some \\"new friends\\" and stating that filming was still underway. The video was released on May 28, 2014 via Amos' Facebook fan page. Critical reception Reactions to the song were highly positive. The track was noted as being signature Amos, with most critics complimenting the song's Americana- influence, Amos' vocal performance, the dark lyrics and the rippling piano. Rolling Stone called the song \\"haunting and eerie,\\" with a showcase vocal range. SPIN found it to be a \\"perfect return\\" and an \\"undeniably good look\\" for Amos. Consequence of Sound said it was a charming song with \\"otherworldly\\" harmonies. Broadway World called the track \\"an eerie Southern blues song,\\" noting that Amos' voice is \\"matchless.\\" Noisey likewise took pleasure in the Americana-influence and vocals. PinkIsTheNewBlog stated its love for the track, favourably comparing the musical style to Scarlet's Walk. Music blog Nuwave Pony also expressed love for the song's \\"groovy, sinister arrangement\\" and \\"honey-coated vocals.\\" Indie music site Death and Taxes likened the song to PJ Harvey's work on Let England Shake, finding Amos' track to be more upbeat and accessible. Exclaim! called it a \\"dust-kicking\\" and spooky track with luscious vocals. Stereogum stated that the song was \\"exactly what we want from Tori.\\" Glide Magazine found Amos' vocals to be \\"fresh, sultry and inviting,\\" in top form and reminiscent of her work in the early 1990s. Flavorwire called the track a typically pretty Amos song, stating: \\"what's not to love?\\" Under the Gun Review said the track \\"is full of spice and any fan of Tori Amos will enjoy it.\\" Faster Louder included the song in their weekly should-hear music roundup, commenting that it was exactly what fans would enjoy. Mxdwn.com called it a soulful blues track, noting Amos' one-of-a-kind vocals and talent for thought-provoking lyrics.

After studying composition at Stanford University and completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University‚Äôs Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, she pursued a music career internationally. Herndon's music often includes human singing voices (including her own), is primarily computer-based, and regularly uses the visual programming language Max/MSP to create custom instruments and vocal processes. She has released music on the labels RVNG Intl. and 4AD. Her most recent full-length album Proto was released on May 10, 2019. Biography =Early life= Holly Herndon was born in 1980 and raised in Johnson City, Tennessee. As a teenager, she spent several years living in Berlin on a high school exchange program, absorbed in the city's dance and techno scene. When Herndon returned to the United States she began studying electronic music at Mills College in Oakland, California. She studied under John Bischoff, James Fei, Maggi Payne, and Fred Frith, receiving her MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media. While at Mills she composed the vocal-generated piece 195, which won her the Elizabeth Mills Crothers award for best composer in 2010. At school she focused on laptop performance, and she currently does most of her composing via laptop. In 2011 she released Car, an independent, near hour-long track on cassette. =Movement (2012)= While attending Mills she began developing her debut album Movement. Movement was released in November 2012 through RVNG Intl, a record label based in Brooklyn. For the album she used the visual programming language Max/MSP to create custom instruments and vocal processes. Movement received a score of 8.1 on Pitchfork, who stated that Herndon \\"uses her crystalline voice as a chief input for her laptop, ultimately arriving at a poignant nexus of electronic accessibility and experimentation that owes as much to her academic forebears as her club contemporaries. It's a record with the rare capacity to turn cynics who might scoff at the idea of laptops-as- intimate-instruments into believers.\\" According to The Quietus, \\"Movement's sound certainly has its forebears and contemporaries - it's possible to detect traces of everyone from Coil and Aphex Twin to Ellen Allien and Laurel Halo in the mix - but equally it contains elements, both sonic and thematic, that are quite unlike any other electronic music currently out there.\\" Also, \\"Herndon's music reflects the ambiguous nature of our interactions with these technologies. It's by turns sensual, blissful and disturbing, and often hints towards all three states at once.\\" =Touring, exhibitions= She toured internationally after the release, also taking part in a number of artistic collaborations such as projects with Iranian writer Reza Negarestani, Chicago producer Jlin, and Hieroglyphic Being. Her collaboration with Conrad Shawcross was exhibited at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. She played the CTM Festival on January 31, 2013 in Berlin. As of late 2012 she is a doctoral candidate in composition at Stanford University. At Stanford she continues to use coding software such as Max/MSP to program many of her own electronic instruments and patches. =Chorus (2014)= Her single \\"Chorus\\" was released on January 24, 2014, with a music video created by Akihiko Taniguchi. \\"Chorus\\" was named Best New Track by Pitchfork. For sounds to build the song, Herndon sampled her browsing experience on the internet, incorporating sources such as YouTube and Skype. The video focuses explicitly on the personal nature of modern computing. According to Herndon, \\"The more comfortable we get with these devices, the more vulnerable we are. We are learning more and more about the NSA revelations; I think it is really interesting that we have never been more intimate with these machines, and at the same time have never had such cause to be suspicious of them. We wanted to capture both of those sides.\\" The full Chorus EP was also released in January on both vinyl and digitally, and it received an 8.0 and positive review in Pitchfork. According to Create Digital Music, few artists have managed to meld the dark thump of techno with the intricate constructions of post-minimalist new music quite like Holly Herndon. Her rapid-punctuated, ethereal vocals are float above complex, dance music- inspired machinery, producing an effect that is arrestingly gorgeous and frightening all at once.\\" =Home (2014)= Herndon released the single \\"Home\\" on September 16, 2014, with a video directed by Dutch design studio Metahaven. According to Herndon, it captures her feeling of losing trust in electronics after the revelations the NSA monitors what some Americans do online. \\"Home\\" continues \\"Chorus\\"'s theme of surveillance: \\"It is a love song for prying eyes (an agent / a critic), and also a break up song with the devices with which I shared a naive relationship.\\" =Platform (2015)= Herndon's second full- length album, Platform, was released on May 19, 2015. The album explores a complicated relationship with technology, and includes a track entitled \\"Lonely at the Top\\" that is intended to trigger Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR).Beaumont-Thomas, Ben (26 April 2015).

Operating since 1929 on Eagle Lake, RKY Camp was founded by The Rotary Club, Kiwanis International, and the YMCA of Kingston, making up the abbreviation 'R.K.Y.'. RKY Camp ran as an all-boys camp until 1969. The camp provides outdoor education and camping opportunities to people of all backgrounds, including integrated summer camping for children and young adults with disabilities through a combined effort with Reach for the Rainbow. RKY Camp provides financial assistance, or \\"camperships\\" to ensure any youth has an opportunity to attend.  History  From 1925‚Äì1928, Camp Koch-pur-wani was run for two-week sessions each summer on the site of the current camp. During this time, the camp temporarily operated free of charge, and the organizers decided that the land was suitable for a permanent facility. The YMCA, working with the Kingston Work Board and the County of Frontenac Work Board, approached The Rotary Club and Kiwanis Club, proposing to purchase the land. In December 1928, both clubs had shown interest in the purchase. On July 3, 1930, The Rotary Club and Kiwanis Club purchased the 25 acres of land for $925.00, while the YMCA supplied approximately $500.00 of equipment. Two representatives from each organization sat on a managing committee to oversee camp operations. RKY Camp is the only camp in the province with joint ownership by three service clubs. In 1930 the managing committee decided that the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs would assist in the payment of camp fees for boys who would otherwise be unable to attend. This led to the campership program which is still offered today. The subsidization allowed camper fees to be at a fair $6.00 per week. Although at the time the camp primarily used tents, the first cabin was built in 1929. A large dining hall was built in 1931 that also acted as an indoor meeting place. The waterfront was also set up in 1931 with a swimming dock, a boating dock, and an 18-foot, 3-level diving tower. In the 1940s, the camp underwent major construction, including the building of many new cabins, a crafts shop, a camp hospital, and new camp headquarters. A motorboat, sailboat, and many rowboats and canoes were stationed at the waterfront. Swimming and boating were popular program activities, which included waterfront safety and diving lessons. In the craft shop, boys learned leather working and woodworking, making camp furniture, paddles, and moccasins. Professors from Queen's University in Kingston would go to RKY Camp to facilitate hikes and conduct lessons in nature study, including astronomy and geology. Activities such as softball, track and field, public speaking, drama, and, in the very early years, bible study were also offered. During the first few years of World War II, the camp continued to operate despite difficulties in finding competent staff. However, in 1943, the camp was forced to close as there was nobody to work in the kitchen. In 1946 the camp re- opened and summer programming resumed. After re-opening, the camp faced a rapid increase in registration and an expansion to the dining hall was required in 1951, and a second time in 1954. Three new cabins were built in 1952, followed by two more in 1957. In 2010 a five-year refurbishment project was started to replace cabins from the 1930s. The traditional end-of-session ceremony has been a memorable program since RKY Camp started, and continues today in what is now called \\"Elements\\". The ceremony originally consisted of traditional native dances and music, local native history, and authentic legends. The program used to end with a friendship fire that was tended to all night. Campers would cut and peel a stick, sign their names on it and burn the end of it in the friendship fire to seal the bonds they made at camp.  Summer camping  Summer camping is split into four twelve-day sessions. Five summer programs are offered each session: one-week youth camp (ages 7‚Äì11), youth camp (ages 7‚Äì12), senior camp (ages 13‚Äì15), leaders-in-training or LIT (ages 15‚Äì16), and counsellors-in-training or CIT (ages 16‚Äì17). Campers are placed into cabins of the same age group, each cabin maintaining a 5:1 camper- staff ratio, usually with 10 campers and two staff. Every cabin participates in an out trip, the length of which is based on their age group. One-week youth campers go on an overnight trip conducted on site, youth campers go on an overnight trip on one of the islands on Eagle Lake, while senior campers, LITs, and CITs go on out trip for multiple nights, conducted in Frontenac Provincial Park or Algonquin Provincial Park. Campers may choose their activities, participate in core programming area activities, and participate in camp wide games. There are seven core programming areas: Swimming, Boating, Adventure, Nature, Arts and Crafts, Campcraft, and Music. Each camper may choose two program areas, which they attend every day. In addition to daily program areas, campers have a chance to develop their skills and explore the other program areas during Free-Choice Times, cabin group activities, interest groups, and \\"Learn-How-To's\\".  Outdoor centre  RKY Camp runs a year-long outdoor centre including \\"school group bookings, outdoor education, leadership development, environmental education, curriculum-based learning, custom programs, family camps, women's weekends, retreats/rentals, March Break camp, PA Day camp, weddings, and out trips and guiding\\". The RKY Camp Outdoor Centre offers similar programming as in the summer season, but also offers season- specific activities, such as snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, tobogganing, and ice fishing.  Duke of Edinburgh's Award  RKY Camp, in collaboration with the Ontario chapter of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, leads many canoeing, hiking, or winter camping trips for people ages 14‚Äì25. Participants working on their Bronze, Silver, or Gold award can work on their practice and adventurous journey and learn many relevant and mandatory skills. The trips are led by RKY Camp's experienced and qualified outdoor educators.

Quietus felt that the album was appreciable by a broad audience with its catchy refrains but was repetitive and lacked the substance of the band's prior works. Punknews was slightly positive, again raising concerns that certain songs was repetitive. However Blood and Cream was exulted as their catchiest song to date. Overall, the reviewer notes that though the album is indistinguishable from others in the genre, for those who like \\"loud sludgy riffs, face-melting solos and Ozzy- esque vocal hooks, Red Fang will satisfy your appetite\\". Exclaim! had mostly positive comments on the album, stating that though similar in nature to their prior music, the music was a major refinement on prior efforts, to form a particularly aggressive variation of stoner rock. AllMusic reported positively, feeling that Red Fang had managed to operate on two levels with the release, managing \\"to get psychedelic without abandoning the non-stop riff-fests that made their first two albums such a welcome change of pace\\". In doing so, it was rated with other successful stand outs of the genre for retaining quality while adding complexity, coupled with being suitable for a wider range of audiences. Pitchfork had mixed or negative analysis of the album. While the technical competence of Red Fang were appreciated, an absence of substance in the music, coupled with extreme repetitiveness, was felt to make the album difficult going and unsuitable for repeat listening.

It was originally recorded in 1970, and consists of band members arguing over the recording of a song, with frequent profanity. It has become one of the best-known spoken-word bootleg recordings, and influenced work such as the film This is Spinal Tap. Background By the late 1960s, the Troggs' commercial success had waned. The production company Dick James Music offered them studio time in the hope of recording a hit single and revitalising their career. The band ‚Äì lead singer Reg Presley, guitarist Chris Britton, bassist Tony Murray and drummer Ronnie Bond ‚Äì together with producer Dennis Berger were booked into DJM's studios in London, which suffered from having the control room and recording room in separate locations, linked only by a Tannoy system and closed-circuit television. The band intended to record a song called \\"Tranquility\\", but had not rehearsed before entering the studio. The session quickly descended into acrimony, with Presley verbally assaulting drummer Bond's ideas and competence. Bond was unable to copy Presley's idea of a drum pattern, which culminated in Presley exclaiming \\"Fuckin' drummer. Oi shit 'em!\\" Larry Page, the band's original producer, said that he usually recorded the band quickly and without fuss, as he expected arguments would otherwise arise. He was not invited to the session that produced The Troggs Tapes and claimed the lack of his usual working methods were a key source of the arguments and tension that resulted. Despite the verbal assaults between Presley and Bond, the pair remained friends until Bond's departure from the band in 1984. Presley later said, \\"When you know somebody that well, you can say almost anything.\\" Release The argument was captured on tape by engineer Clive Franks with help of tape op Barry Sherlock, and made its way onto bootlegs in the early 1970s. The release gave the Troggs an infamous reputation, though it also raised their public profile. Though the band's career collapsed shortly after the session, it was revitalised by the bootleg's notoriety and led to the band reforming and becoming popular with punk rock audiences towards the end of the 1970s. Presley was originally unhappy with the release, but later gave a positive opinion of it, saying that bands could listen to it as an example of why they should relax in the studio and not take things seriously.  Cultural references  The Troggs Tapes were referenced in the Father Ted episode \\"A Song for Europe\\". In this episode, the priests Ted and Dougal write a song for Ireland in the \\"Eurosong Contest\\". In one scene, Ted is shown getting angry at Dougal for being unable to play the correct note. Ted swears at Dougal similar to the way Presley swore at Bond in the original bootleg. In the Father Ted script book, one of the episode's writers Graham Linehan notes that he initially wanted the scene to run longer, but that it was ultimately cut down to just long enough for people familiar with the out-take to get the reference. Dermot Morgan, who played Ted, enjoyed the scene, which allowed him to swear excessively. The rock/comedy film This is Spinal Tap has a scene where the band are having an argument in a similar style. Presley later speculated that Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's series of Derek and Clive recordings, consisting of surreal and obscene conversations not originally intended for release, may have been inspired by The Troggs Tapes.

The goal of the increased funding would be to combat the Russian \\"propaganda\\" into the Crimean peninsula, which had been illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, provoking international condemnation and severe economic sanctions against Russia. The United States House of Representatives wrote in their bill to provide aid to the Ukraine, the Ukraine Support Act (H.R. 4278; 113th Congress), that \\"the Russian Government has deliberately blocked the Ukrainian people's access to uncensored sources of information and has provided alternative news and information that is both inaccurate and inflammatory.\\" The Senate's Ukraine aid bill failed to include any provisions to provide increased funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty or the Voice of America, so they wrote this separate bill to do so. The law was passed during the 113th United States Congress. Background =2014 Crimea crisis= The 2014 Crimean crisis is an ongoing international crisis principally involving Russia and Ukraine. Most developments apply to the Crimean Peninsula, formerly a multi-ethnic region of Ukraine composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the administratively separate municipality of Sevastopol; both are populated by an ethnic Russian majority and a minority of both ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. The crisis unfolded in late February 2014 in the aftermath of the Ukrainian Revolution which resulted in President Viktor Yanukovich's impeachment by the Ukrainian parliament after his flight from the capital, and the interim appointment of a new government. The Yatsenyuk Government attained recognition from western countries.New Ukraine Government Has White House's Support, U.S. Vice President Says, The Moscow Times (28 February 2014)Joe Biden calls new Ukraine leader, pledges support, Politico (27 February 2014)Biden: U.S. Supports Ukraine's New Government, Voice of America (27 February 2014)Vice President Biden calls Ukraine PM Yatseniuk, pledges U.S. support, Reuters (27 February 2014) However, the Russian government held that Yanukovych was illegally impeached and continues to regard him as Ukraine's last democratically elected and legitimate president, while considering the Yatsenyuk government illegitimate and the result of a \\"coup d'etat\\", on constitutional grounds.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-feffer/who-are-these-people- anyw_b_4964526.html Who Are These 'People,' Anyway? Beginning on February 26, pro-Russian forces began to gradually take control of the Crimean peninsula. At first the gunmen, wearing masks and unmarked uniforms, seized government buildings2014 Crimean crisis#cite note-NYT-60 but by no later than the 24th of March had occupied all Ukrainian military bases in Crimea, forcing the Ukraine armed forces to withdraw from the peninsula. During this time, the question of secession was put to a referendum, which resulted in a 96% affirmative vote but has been condemned by the EU, USA, and the interim Ukraine government as unconstitutional and thus illegal. Despite international opposition, on March 17 the Crimean parliament declared independence from Ukraine and asked to join the Russian Federation. As a result, on March 27 the U.N. General Assembly passed a non-binding Resolution 68/262 that declared invalid Crimea's referendum. =United States Congressional response= On March 5, 2014, U.S. Representative Hal Rogers introduced the bill To provide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine (H.R. 4152; 113th Congress), a bill that would provide loan guarantees to Ukraine of up to $1 billion, part of the American response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. On March 6, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 114 to pass the bill 385‚Äì23. On March 25, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid indicated that United States Senate would vote on this bill on March 27, 2014, but only after amending it to include provisions that would put sanctions \\"against anyone deemed by the president to have undermined Ukraine's security or independence, or to have engaged in corruption in Ukraine or Russia.\\" On March 12, 2014, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez introduced the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (S. 2124; 113th Congress), a bill that would provide funds to implement a U.S. quota increase at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), rescind other funds previously appropriated for the IMF, and provide or authorize various forms of assistance to Ukraine and the surrounding region. It would require sanctions on individuals responsible for violence, corruption, human rights abuses, or undermining stability in Ukraine, and would authorize sanctions on certain individuals in Russia. On March 24, 2014, the Senate voted 78‚Äì17 to advance the bill to floor consideration. Consideration of the bill was withdrawn, however, the next day, after a decision by Majority Leader Harry Reid. Instead of continuing with this bill and its controversial International Monetary Fund provisions, the Senate was to take up a House-passed bill already offering Ukraine loan guarantees, amending it to add sanctions provisions. =Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty= Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) is a broadcaster funded by the U.S. Congress that provides \\"news, information, and analysis\\" to countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East \\"where the free flow of information is either banned by government authorities or not fully developed\\". RFE/RL is supervised by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a bi-partisan federal agency overseeing all U.S. international broadcasting services. RFE/RL was headquartered at Englischer Garten in Munich, Germany, from 1949 to 1995. In 1995, the headquarters were moved to Prague in the Czech Republic. European operations have been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the headquarters, the service maintains 20 local bureaus in countries throughout their broadcast region, as well as a corporate office in Washington, D.C. RFE/RL broadcasts in 28 languages to 21 countries including Armenia, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill would direct Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Incorporated, and the Voice of America (VOA) service to Ukraine and neighboring regions to: (1) provide accurate and accessible news and information; (2) emphasize investigative and analytical journalism to highlight misinformation provided by Russian or pro-Russian media outlets; (3) prioritize programming to target populations and areas where access to uncensored information is limited, especially populations serviced by Russian supported media outlets; (4) increase the number of reporters and organizational presence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Crimea; (5) promote democratic processes, human rights, freedom of the press, and territorial sovereignty; (6) increase programming and content services to Russia; (7) partner with private sector broadcasters and affiliates to increase distribution; (8) expand the use and audience of mobile news and multimedia platforms, including through Internet-based social networking platforms; and (9) provide programming content 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to target populations, including specified programming in Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages. The bill would authorize FY2014 appropriations for programming in the Ukrainian, Balkan, Russian, and Tatar language services of RFE/RL, Incorporated, and VOA. The bill would require the Broadcasting Board of Governors to report to Congress on plans to increase broadcasts. Procedural history The United States International Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions was introduced on March 27, 2014 by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The bill was not referred to any committees. The United States Senate voted on March 27, 2014 by unanimous consent to pass the bill. The House voted on April 1, 2014, to pass the bill 399‚Äì12 in Roll Call Vote 150. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on April 3, 2014. Debate and discussion Representative Ed Royce argued in favor of funding increased broadcasts by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of America because \\"Moscow is using propaganda to sow confusion and fear in the Ukraine right now.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Acts of the 113th United States Congress Notes References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 2183 *beta.congress.gov S. 2183 *GovTrack.us S. 2183 *OpenCongress S. 2183 *WashingtonWatch S. 2183 *Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Ukraine archive *Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Ukraine homepage Category:United States foreign relations legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress Category:Russo- Ukrainian War Category:Ukraine‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"United States International Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions"},{"id":"42328287","text":"Ration cards are an official document issued by state governments in India to households that are eligible to purchase subsidised food grain from the Public Distribution System under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). They also serve as a common form of identification for many Indians. Under the NFSA, all state governments in India have to identify households that are eligible for purchasing subsidised food grain from the Public Distribution System and provide them with ration cards. There are two types of ration cards under NFSA: * Priority Household (PHH) ration cards are issued to households that meet the eligibility criteria set by their state government. Each priority household is entitled to 5 kilograms of food grain per member per month. * Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) ration cards are issued to \\"poorest of poor\\" households. Each AAY household is entitled to 35 kilograms of food grain per month. Before the NFSA was enacted, there were three types of ration cards: * Above Poverty Line (APL) ration cards that were issued to households living above the poverty line (as estimated by the Planning Commission). These households received 15 kilogram of food grain (based on availability). * Below Poverty Line (BPL) ration cards that were issued to households living below the poverty line. These households received 25-35 kilograms of food grain. * Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) ration cards that were issued to \\"poorest of poor\\" households. These households received 35 kilograms of food grain. Application Process Section 10 (1a and 1b) of the National Food Security Act requires states governments to identify households to be covered under priority and AAY categories within a year from the commencement of NFSA and place the list of identified eligible households in the public domain. After the enactment of NFSA, all state governments developed a set of eligibility criteria to identify households for issuing ration cards. Based on this eligibility criteria, new ration cards were issued. In some states (such as Bihar and Madhya Pradesh), the state governments used existing data (such as the Socio-Economic Caste Census) to identify households and issue new ration cards. In other states (such as Chhattisgarh and Odisha), eligible households had to apply for new ration cards through a self-declaration process. Fake ration cards Many problems with the PDS ration system exist. There are millions of ineligible and fraudulent ration cards; at the same time, millions of poor families have no ration card. PDS shop owners in collusion with government officials divert the subsidized food supply and petroleum to the black market. Card numbers are inflated by those held under false or duplicate names, in the names of dead people, or by real but ineligible people. =Aadhaar-enabled beneficiary= The bank accounts and ration cards of eligible beneficiaries are linked to their Aadhaar numbers. A bank account can be enabled as AeBA by seeding (linking) it with an Aadhaar number. Seeding makes mapping information stored on the NPCI payment gateway that facilitates the subsidy payment. Seeding helps identify genuine and eligible beneficiaries and prevents duplicate and non-existent persons from registering. Users can link a bank account as self-service option through ATM kiosks, the Internet, bank websites, telephone, or by providing a copy of the Aadhaar letter to a bank. Prior to Aadhaar, the issues plaguing and derailing social security programs in India were caused by corrupt officials and middlemen manipulating paper records and stand-alone databases of social security services. Due to lack of a unique identifier like Aadhaar, stand-alone databases cannot detect and eliminate duplicate or fraudulent beneficiaries. The most common modus operandi adopted to inflate the beneficiary list is by inserting duplicate entries, non-existent names, and the names of dead and non-eligible people. Attempts are then made to steal the social security benefits money, depriving genuine claimants. =Aadhaar-enabled DBT= Aadhaar-enabled service delivery (AeSD) prevents corruption in retail by directly crediting benefit money into the beneficiary's bank account; this is called Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). It eliminates middlemen and fraudulent, ineligible beneficiaries. In this way, Aadhaar saves billions of rupees of public money annually and enables poor people access to social security benefits. Various financial and other services are being Aadhaar-enabled, called Aadhaar-enabled Service Delivery (AeSD), in a phased manner. By 1 January 2014, half of India (289 districts across various states) had been covered by DBT for subsidized LPG. By August 2013, 6.3 million duplicate LPG connections were detected by Aadhaar and were cancelled. The national government saved $1 billion on reduced imports by mid-2013. =Aadhaar-enabled eligibility check= Applicant eligibility is checked by comparing the service delivery database with other databases. For example, PDS kerosene eligibility is checked by comparing the PDS database with the LPG database. The subsidy on kerosene allocation is reduced if the LPG subsidy is detected for that household. Ration card eligibility is cross- checked with other related, Aadhaar-linked databases. This approach is designed to improve the audit trail, add efficiency and prevent corruption. It results in direct benefit access for eligible people and annually saves billions of rupees from corruption. Tangible benefits became visible from 2014; a report by UBS published in January 2014 showed Aadhaar DBT can save 1.2% of GDP. The finance minister informed the Parliament during Vote on Account that as of 31 January 2014, under DBT ‚Çπ33 billion for 21 million LPG subsidy and ‚Çπ6.28 billion (628 crores) have been transferred for various social programs in 5.4 million transactions. =e-Ration Card Services= With the help of e-Ration service, applicants can obtain ration cards and check their costs and food grain availability online. This will help end the corrupt practice of holding back rations and ensure cards reach the needy. Aadhaar card holders can apply for e-ration cards. The Department of Food Supplies and Consumer Affairs website provides eligibility details for the food security plan. This service was first introduced in Delhi. Later this has been followed by the state Govt of Tamil Nadu PDS ration in Andhra Pradesh PDS rationing in districts of Andhra Pradesh can be an illustrative example of using modern technology to prevent retail corruption. Ration cards and corresponding bank accounts of the heads of families (HoF) have been linked with Aadhaar Numbers of family members. When a beneficiary buys rations from a PDS shop, their eligibility is authenticated through an Aadhaar KYC handheld device. The PDS computer system reads out the quantity eligibility and balance of each item in the local language. After purchase, the balance quantities for that month are read out. The buyer pays the open market rate to the PDS shop. A computer prints a receipt showing all items purchased, balance items, money paid and subsidy amount. The subsidy amount is credited to the beneficiary's bank account under the DBT program. Because the PDS computer system is connected to a central server, beneficiaries can buy ration items from any PDS shop. The system is flexible and provides access and options to the public that was not seen before in PDS. Once all PDS shops in the state are linked to Aadhaar- enabled central server, beneficiaries can buy their rations anywhere in the state without changing their ration card, which will benefit migrant workers in the state. Similarly, subsidized LPG is linked with the Aadhaar Number and delivery is made at market rate. The subsidy amount is credited as DBT to the eligible beneficiary. Leakage and diversions of subsidized commodities provide no benefit to middlemen and retail corruption comes to a halt. While submitting application for Ration Card in Andhra pradesh, Form D1 needs to be submitted to the nearest rationing office. m-Ration Mitra in Madhya Pradesh Difficult times call for innovative solutions. While the pandemic wreaks havoc, governments all over the world have been finding ways to deal with the situation. Among such attempts is the interesting proposition by the National Food Security Act with the Madhya Pradesh Government, which is aiming to provide food grains at really affordable prices to those who cannot possibly afford it in the current circumstances. M Ration Mitra is a smartphone application that allows people to register for Ration cards through mobile phones, which essentially fast tracks the whole process exponentially. You can download it here.This is primarily done to make sure that those below the Poverty Line do not have to wait for the procedures before getting access to food grains. Through the M-Ration Mitra application, consumers can avail food grains at ration shops and can also receive notification regarding the status of the POS machine in ration shops. They can even receive the address of the nearest ration shops and the benefits of the M-Ration card can be availed by anyone in the family. The M-Ration Mitra will also serve as a consumer complaint forum, which will allow consumers to complain about the closure of shops, short-weighing, or non-distribution of certain food items.

The Lungotevere takes its name from the Janiculum hill, rising within the Rione; it has been established on July 20, 1887. In the area of the present Lungotevere, not far from Palazzo Salviati, formerly rose the Leonine Harbour, erected by Pope Leo XII in 1827 and used for ships docking and goods unloading; it was destroyed in 1863. Together with the Harbour, a fountain was erected: it was transferred to Piazza Pietro d'Illiria during the building of the muraglioni (massive walls) of the Lungotevere. In its place, two drinking fountains were realized, about halfway the staircases going down to the river: they are idle since 1950. This is one of the stretches of Lungotevere that mainly show the superelevation in respect with the historic streets along the river (in this case, Via della Lungara); another one is Lungotevere Tor di Nona.

He was the starting quarterback in Darrell Royal's last game. Early life Mark McBath was a highly recruited high school quarterback who played at Richard King High School in Corpus Christi. He was All City once and All District and All South Texas two years in a row. He also made the All District team as a center fielder for the baseball team. College career McBath's career at Texas was marked by an early rise, an unfortunate injury, a spectacular finish and a surprising early departure. McBath arrived at the University of Texas in 1976 as the back-up to Randy McEachern, Ted Constanzo and Mike Cordaro and was competing with fellow freshman Jon Aune for the fourth-string role. But an injury to McEachern in August, and inconsistent play by Constanzo and Cordaro, led Darrell Royal to put McBath in as starter as a true freshman. He started four games that season, going 2‚Äì2, including a loss to number 11 Texas A&M; and a victory over Arkansas after Coach Royal announced that it would be his last game as Texas' head coach. McBath started the 1977 season as the starting quarterback and led Texas to three consecutive wins and the number 4 ranking, while sharing playing time with Jon Aune. But his season was sidelined when he broke his ankle on the seventh play of the Oklahoma game. He was diagnosed with a loose ankle ligament and placed in a cast for over two months. He was out for the rest of the season while Texas went undefeated and played in the Cotton Bowl for the national championship. The following spring, McBath was unable to go full speed in drills because of his recovering ankle. As a result, McEachern was named the starter one week prior to the season opener, with McBath relegated to the third string. McEachern and Donnie Little took most of the snaps that season, with McBath getting mop-up duty against Rice and TCU, until Texas was upset by unranked Baylor late in the season. In that game, McBath got a larger portion of the playing time and threw three interceptions. For reasons that Akers never stated, McBath was given the start the next week, in the final regular-season game against Texas A&M.; He led number 14 Texas to a 22‚Äì7 victory and was named the Chevrolet Offensive Player of the Game. He was given the start again in the Sun Bowl game against Maryland and they won in a 42‚Äì0 rush-dominated blowout.http://stats.texassports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/stats/78/ut- md.htm Even though he was projected to be the starter the next season, and had said that late in the season that he was definitely coming back in 1979, McBath quit football a month after quarterbacking the Longhorns in their Sun Bowl win. He left with a year of eligibility remaining so that he could focus on getting his grades up to medical school standards. He figured he had no chance in the NFL, and saw football getting in the way of his dream of going to medical school. He finished his career with 9 victories and 2 losses as a starter. Later life McBath graduated from Texas with a degree in biology and went to medical school in Houston, Texas. He spent five years as a surgical resident at Hermann Hospital and then held a teaching fellowship in surgical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Tumor Institute. He later left to enter his own practice in Houston. Dr. McBath is a board certified general surgeon and fellowship-trained surgical oncologist. In his practice, he performs a wide range of surgical procedures, including cancer operations, with vast experience in treating breast cancer.https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mark-McBath-MD/176533965734690?sk=info He was published in the 2005 edition of Texas Super Doctors, a publication that selects doctors according to outstanding achievements.
