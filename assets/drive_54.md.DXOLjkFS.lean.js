It is west of Saint-Sauveur and north of Lachute; municipally, it is within the Regional County Municipality of Les Pays-d'en- Haut. It is primarily a tourist town, having a large ski hill (Ski Morin Heights) that is popular during the winter months and being on a recreational trailway (the Aerobic Corridor), which is used year-round. A dense network of hiking, cross country skiing, snowshoeing and mountain biking trails surround Morin Heights, making it the closest multi-recreational outdoor hub to Montreal (45-minute drive in moderate traffic). The old train station, on Lac √âcho road, is the starting point for most recreational activities, year-round. The Rivi√®re √† Simon offers enjoyable canoeing and kayaking all the way down to Christieville and beyond. Formerly located just south of the town was a recording studio, called Le Studio, built in 1975, which is now closed. The facility was used by numerous Canadian and international artists, including The Tragically Hip, Rush, Nazareth, Pilot, April Wine, Rainbow, Barenaked Ladies, Sting, The Police, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, The Bee Gees, Cat Stevens, and Lawrence Gowan, as well as by Quebec artists Jean-Pierre Ferland, Richard S√©guin, Lucien Franc≈ìur and Garolou. In 1994, another important music recording facility was built in Morin Heights, on the northern edge of town. Conceived and built by Swedish-born artist Lars Westvind, Studio Nomade exclusively hosted Sarah McLachlan's recording projects up to 2000. It then was open to other artists, and is still a frequently used production facility. The town hosts a theatre company featuring mostly English-language plays, as well as a choir. History The first European settlers (the Seale brothers) arrived from Ireland around 1850, followed by French Canadians from Lachute, Saint-J√©r√¥me and Saint-Eustache. In 1852, the Morin Township was formed and in 1855, the Township Municipality of Morin-Partie-Sud was established in a part of the township (the remaining part became Sainte-Ad√®le). The township was named after its founder and 19th-century politician Augustin-Norbert Morin (1803‚Äì1865) who had at that point a huge farm of more than on the banks of the Rivi√®re du Nord, built around 1850-1860 and included a home, saw mill, and flour mill. An alternate, less accepted origin for the name Morin concerns an engineer named Morin who was dispatched by the provincial government to survey the region and had hired a Native American named Simon as guide, whose name was used to identify the river flowing through the township. Until 1911, the territory had just the names of Bas-Morin or Morin Flats, name of the post office between 1875 and 1911, while the railway station was known as Morin Heights Station. In 1950, Morin-Partie-Sud changed its statutes and name to become the Municipality of Morin-Heights. The town gained notoriety in 1994 when members of the Order of the Solar Temple took part in a mass suicide, after setting fire to the ski chalet they occupied in the community. On March 12, 2008, a tragic roof collapse in the Gourmet du Village bakery warehouse killed three women. An excessive accumulation of snow was suspected to be the cause of the accident. A total of 40 people were in the building at the time of the collapse.

Human interface guidelines (HIG) are software development documents which offer application developers a set of recommendations. Their aim is to improve the experience for the users by making application interfaces more intuitive, learnable, and consistent. Most guides limit themselves to defining a common look and feel for applications in a particular desktop environment. The guides enumerate specific policies. Policies are sometimes based on studies of human‚Äìcomputer interaction (so called usability studies), but most are based on conventions chosen by the platform developers preferences. The central aim of a HIG is to create a consistent experience across the environment (generally an operating system or desktop environment), including the applications and other tools being used. This means both applying the same visual design and creating consistent access to and behaviour of common elements of the interface ‚Äì from simple ones such as buttons and icons up to more complex constructions, such as dialog boxes. HIGs are recommendations and advice meant to help developers create better applications. Developers sometimes intentionally choose to break them if they think that the guidelines do not fit their application, or usability testing reveals an advantage in doing so. But in turn, the organization publishing the HIG might withhold endorsement of the application. Mozilla Firefox's user interface, for example, goes against the GNOME project's HIG, which is one of the main arguments for including Epiphany instead of Firefox in the GNOME distribution.Epiphany Project FAQ: Mozilla and Firefox - GNOME Wiki  Scope  Human interface guidelines often describe the visual design rules, including icon and window design and style. Much less frequently, they specify how user input and interaction mechanisms work. Aside from the detailed rules, guidelines sometimes also make broader suggestions about how to organize and design the application and write user-interface text. HIGs are also done for applications. In this case the HIG will build on a platform HIG by adding the common semantics for a range of application functions.  Cross-platform guidelines  In contrast to platform-specific guidelines, cross-platform guidelines aren't tied to a distinct platform. These guidelines make recommendations which should be true on any platform. Since this isn't always possible, cross-platform guidelines may weigh the compliance against the imposed work load.

Organisms like plants, fungi and certain bacteria that cannot fix nitrogen gas (N2) depend on the ability to assimilate nitrate or ammonia for their needs. Other organisms, like animals, depend entirely on organic nitrogen from their food. Nitrogen assimilation in plants Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil in the form of nitrate (NO3‚àí) and ammonium (NH4+). In aerobic soils where nitrification can occur, nitrate is usually the predominant form of available nitrogen that is absorbed. However this is not always the case as ammonia can predominate in grasslands and in flooded, anaerobic soils like rice paddies. Plant roots themselves can affect the abundance of various forms of nitrogen by changing the pH and secreting organic compounds or oxygen. This influences microbial activities like the inter-conversion of various nitrogen species, the release of ammonia from organic matter in the soil and the fixation of nitrogen by non-nodule-forming bacteria. Ammonium ions are absorbed by the plant via ammonia transporters. Nitrate is taken up by several nitrate transporters that use a proton gradient to power the transport. Nitrogen is transported from the root to the shoot via the xylem in the form of nitrate, dissolved ammonia and amino acids. Usually (but not always) most of the nitrate reduction is carried out in the shoots while the roots reduce only a small fraction of the absorbed nitrate to ammonia. Ammonia (both absorbed and synthesized) is incorporated into amino acids via the glutamine synthetase- glutamate synthase (GS-GOGAT) pathway. While nearly all the ammonia in the root is usually incorporated into amino acids at the root itself, plants may transport significant amounts of ammonium ions in the xylem to be fixed in the shoots. This may help avoid the transport of organic compounds down to the roots just to carry the nitrogen back as amino acids. Nitrate reduction is carried out in two steps. Nitrate is first reduced to nitrite (NO2‚àí) in the cytosol by nitrate reductase using NADH or NADPH. Nitrite is then reduced to ammonia in the chloroplasts (plastids in roots) by a ferredoxin dependent nitrite reductase. In photosynthesizing tissues, it uses an isoform of ferredoxin (Fd1) that is reduced by PSI while in the root it uses a form of ferredoxin (Fd3) that has a less negative midpoint potential and can be reduced easily by NADPH. In non photosynthesizing tissues, NADPH is generated by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. In the chloroplasts, glutamine synthetase incorporates this ammonia as the amide group of glutamine using glutamate as a substrate. Glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT and NADH-GOGAT) transfer the amide group onto a 2-oxoglutarate molecule producing two glutamates. Further transaminations are carried out make other amino acids (most commonly asparagine) from glutamine. While the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) does not play a direct role in the assimilation, it protects the mitochondrial functions during periods of high nitrogen metabolism and takes part in nitrogen remobilization. =pH and Ionic balance during nitrogen assimilation= Different plants use different pathways to different levels. Tomatoes take in a lot of K+ and accumulate salts in their vacuoles, castor reduces nitrate in the roots to a large extent and excretes the resulting alkali. Soy bean plants moves a large amount of malate to the roots where they convert it to alkali while the potassium is recirculated. Every nitrate ion reduced to ammonia produces one OH‚àí ion. To maintain a pH balance, the plant must either excrete it into the surrounding medium or neutralize it with organic acids. This results in the medium around the plants roots becoming alkaline when they take up nitrate. To maintain ionic balance, every NO3‚àí taken into the root must be accompanied by either the uptake of a cation or the excretion of an anion. Plants like tomatoes take up metal ions like K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ to exactly match every nitrate taken up and store these as the salts of organic acids like malate and oxalate. Other plants like the soybean balance most of their NO3‚àí intake with the excretion of OH‚àí or HCO3‚àí. Plants that reduce nitrates in the shoots and excrete alkali from their roots need to transport the alkali in an inert form from the shoots to the roots. To achieve this they synthesize malic acid in the leaves from neutral precursors like carbohydrates. The potassium ions brought to the leaves along with the nitrate in the xylem are then sent along with the malate to the roots via the phloem. In the roots, the malate is consumed. When malate is converted back to malic acid prior to use, an OH‚àí is released and excreted. (RCOO‚àí \\\\+ H2O -> RCOOH +OH‚àí) The potassium ions are then recirculated up the xylem with fresh nitrate. Thus the plants avoid having to absorb and store excess salts and also transport the OH‚àí. Plants like castor reduce a lot of nitrate in the root itself, and excrete the resulting base. Some of the base produced in the shoots is transported to the roots as salts of organic acids while a small amount of the carboxylates are just stored in the shoot itself. Nitrogen use efficiency Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is the proportion of nitrogen present that a plant absorbs and uses. Improving nitrogen use efficiency and thus fertilizer efficiency is important to make agriculture more sustainable, by reducing pollution and production cost and increasing yield. Worldwide, crops generally have less than 50% NUE. Better fertilizers, improved crop management, and genetic engineering can increase NUE. Nitrogen use efficiency can be measured at the ecosystem level or at the level of photosynthesis in leaves, when it is termed photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE).

He served as the tenth Lieutenant Governor of the province from October 6, 1926 until his death. Burrows was born in Ottawa, Canada West (now Ontario), where his grandfather had been a pioneer settler. He moved to Manitoba in 1875, and was subsequently educated at Manitoba College. In 1877, Burrows became the first law student in Winnipeg history, working in the office of one Frederick Mackenzie. He entered the lumber business in 1879, and subsequently played a major role in developing the industry in Manitoba's northwest. Burrows entered politics in 1892, winning election to the provincial legislature in the riding of Dauphin. Although he described himself as a Liberal-Conservative, he was nevertheless a supporter of Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway. Burrows defeated his Conservative opponent Glenlyon Campbell by 317 votes to 308. Burrows defeated Campbell a second time in 1896, by 589 votes to 577. By this time, he was identifying himself as a Liberal. He was also (like Greenway) a Methodist, and was a strong supporter of Canada's growing prohibition movement. In addition to his political career, he was also appointed a land commissioner of the Canadian Northern Railway in 1896, holding the position until 1904 and overseeing increased settlement in the Dauphin region. Perhaps curiously, he was never appointed to Greenway's cabinet. The Liberals lost the election of 1899, although Burrows actually increased his majority significantly‚Äîdefeating Conservative R. Hunt by 1203 votes to 779. It may be assumed that the new settlers brought by Burrows to the region were instrumental in his victory. Burrows did not seek re-election in 1903, but campaigned for the federal House of Commons the following year. Running as a Liberal in the federal riding of Dauphin, he was elected unopposed, and supported Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier in parliament for the next four years. He was upset by his old rival Glenlyon Campbell, 3206 votes to 2989, in the election of 1908, and did not re-enter political life thereafter. In 1926, Burrows was appointed Lt. Governor of Manitoba (a position that was largely ceremonial by this time). A talented singer, he often displayed his baritone voice to visitors at Government House. He died in office, in 1929. The north-end Winnipeg neighbourhood of Burrows is named after him.

Laconia was delivered to the Cunard Line on 12 December 1911, and began service on 20 January 1912. She was the first Cunard ship of that name. She was torpedoed and sunk on 25 February 1917 during World War I; 12 passengers were killed. Laconia was intended for the Liverpool- Boston service with cruising from New York to the Mediterranean off season. The ship was the first British ship and first North Atlantic liner to be equipped with anti-roll tanks. Drafted into war service On the outbreak of World War I, Laconia was converted into an armed merchant cruiser in 1914. She was fitted with eight guns and for a time she carried two seaplanes, which were housed on the quarterdeck. She was based at Simon's Town, South Africa in the South Atlantic, from which she patrolled the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean until April 1915. She was then used as a headquarters ship stationed at Zanzibar and engaged in operations for the capture of Tanga and the colony of German East Africa. She was mainly employed on patrol duties but on one occasion, was engaged at the bombardment of Tanga. She continued to serve on the East Africa station, and made several trips from Durban and Cape Town with troops for the army in British East Africa. Laconia returned home to the UK with a convoy in June 1916, with a large shipment of gold ingots from Cape Town, and was paid off at Devonport. Returned to Cunard She was handed back to Cunard in July 1916 and on 9 September resumed service. On 25 February 1917, she was torpedoed by northwest by west of Fastnet while returning from the United States to England with 75 passengers (34 first class and 41 second class) and a crew of 217 commanded by Captain Irvine. The first torpedo struck the liner on the starboard side just abaft the engine room, but did not sink her. 20 minutes later a second torpedo exploded in the engine room, again on the starboard side, and the vessel sank at 10:20 pm. A total of 12 people were killed; six crew and six passengers. Two of the killed passengers were American citizens, Mrs. Mary Hoy and her daughter, Miss Elizabeth Hoy, who were originally from Chicago. The death of the Hoys stirred up public opinion in America against the Germans, and raised public support for the United States entering the war. Chicago Tribune reporter Floyd Gibbons was aboard Laconia when she was torpedoed and gained fame from his dispatches about the attack, his graphic account of the sinking read to both Houses of Congress and was credited with helping to push the United States into joining the war. Rediscovery In March 2009, it was announced that the wreck of Laconia was located in November 2008 and claimed by Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc., a commercial archaeology company in Tampa, Florida. She was found about off of the coast of Ireland. \\"Britain claims it is the legitimate owner of the wrecks because, under a wartime insurance scheme, it paid the owners of the vessels when they sank, in effect making the remains the property of the taxpayer.\\" The search for the wreck was featured on an episode of Discovery Channel's Treasure Quest titled \\"The Silver Queen\\". Items salvaged were 852 bars of silver and 132 boxes of silver coins worth an estimated ¬£3m. One of the artifacts recovered during their investigation of the wreck happened to be the remains of a left shoe that likely belonged to one of the ship's female passengers.

Ex-editor in chief Dmitry Muratov shortly after having received the Four Freedoms Award on behalf of Novaya Gazeta. It is published in Moscow, in regions within Russia, and in some foreign countries. As of 2009, the print edition is published on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; English-language articles on the website are published irregularly. Six Novaya Gazeta journalists, including Yury Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya and Anastasia Baburova, have been murdered since 2001, in connection with their investigations. History A group of former journalists from Komsomolskaya pravda organised the newspaper in 1993, its first name was Ezhednevnaya Novaya Gazeta (Daily New Gazette). Mikhail Gorbachev used the money from his 1990 Nobel Peace Prize to help establish the Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and purchase its first computers. =International Industrial Bank investigation= On 26 November 2001, Novaya Gazeta published an article by Oleg Lurie stating that the management of the International Industrial Bank, headed by Sergey Pugachyov, had been involved in money laundering in the Bank of New York. Pugachyov's bank brought a libel suit against the newspaper, citing financial losses, as a number of its customers had allegedly changed the terms of their accounts in a way which made the bank lose money because of the publication. On 28 February 2002, the bank won the case in Moscow's Basmanny municipal court and was awarded 15 million rubles (about $500,000) in lost revenue, an unprecedented sum for Russian newspapers that might undermine the very existence of Novaya Gazeta, especially as on 22 February Novaya Gazeta had been ordered by the same Basmanny court to pay about $1 million for a corruption allegation against the Krasnodar Krai's top judge. In April, the decision on the International Industrial Bank case was reconfirmed by a court. However, in an article of 27 May 2002, Yulia Latynina, a Novaya Gazeta journalist, revealed that the bank's three customers named in the lawsuit were its subsidiaries or otherwise controlled by its board of directors, and claimed that Novaya Gazeta had requested the opening of a criminal fraud investigation into the activities of the bank. As a result, in June 2002 the International Industrial Bank renounced its claim to the compensation. =Yury Shchekochikhin= Yury Shchekochikhin, a journalist and deputy in the State Duma, had also worked for the newspaper as an investigative journalist and had been a deputy Editor-in- Chief until he died from a mysterious and severe allergy on 3 July 2003. Some of his contributions published in Novaya Gazeta were related to the investigation of the Three Whales Corruption Scandal. =Mishap with Prime Minister Sergey Kirienko= In 2004, the newspaper printed seven articles by columnist Georgy Rozhnov, which accused Sergey Kiriyenko of embezzling US$4.8 billion of International Monetary Fund funds in 1998 when he was Prime Minister of Russia. The newspaper based the accusations on a letter allegedly written to Colin Powell and signed by U.S. Congressmen Philip Crane, Mike Pence, Charlie Norwood, Dan Burton and Henry Bonilla and posted on the website of the American Defense Council. The newspaper claimed that Kiriyenko had used some of the embezzled funds to purchase real estate in the United States. It was later revealed that the letter was a prank concocted by The eXile. In response, Kiriyenko sued Novaya Gazeta and Rozhnov for libel, and in passing judgement in favour of Kiriyenko the court ordered Novaya Gazeta to retract all publications relating to the accusations and went on to say that the newspaper \\"is obliged to publish only officially proven information linking Mr Kiriyenko with embezzlement.\\" =Igor Domnikov= Igor Domnikov was well known in Novaya Gazeta among his colleagues for his witty essays and acerbic tone. He was attacked on his way to his Moscow apartment, near the doorway, on 12 May 2000. Hit with a hard object, presumably a hammer by an unknown assailant, he was lying unconscious in a pool of his own blood when found by a neighbor; Igor Domnikov was delivered to a hospital with skull and brain injuries, underwent surgery, but remained in a coma. He died from the injuries on 16 July 2000. 5 members of a gang were arrested in August 2007 on suspicion of murder and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 18 years to life for the murder as well as other crimes. On 11 March 2015, Former Deputy Governor of Lipetsk Oblast Sergei Dorovskoi was charged by Investigative Committee of Russia with inciting the murder, but Sergei Dorovskoi was never punished because of the statute of limitations. Investigations have found that Igor Domnikov had written a series of reports about life in the Lipetsk region in 1999-2000, where journalist criticized the local government for corruption, which was the motive for Sergei Dorovskoi to incite other to kill the journalist. =Anna Politkovskaya= Journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Russia's actions in Chechnya, wrote for Novaya Gazeta until her assassination on 7 October 2006. Politkovskaya wrote in an essay that the editors received: \\"Visitors every day in our editorial office who have nowhere else to bring their troubles, because the Kremlin finds their stories off- message, so that the only place they can be aired is in our newspaper, Novaya Gazeta.\\" =Stanislav Markelov and Anastasia Baburova= Journalist and human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov was shot and killed in Moscow on 19 January 2009 while leaving a press conference about his last minute appeal against the early release of Yuri Budanov, a former Russian military officer convicted for kidnapping and aggravated murder of a young Chechen woman.\\"Chechen Rights Lawyer and Journalist Shot in Moscow\\". The International Herald Tribune Retrieved 01-19-2009 Anastasia Baburova, a freelance journalist for Novaya Gazeta and a member of Autonomous Action, was with Markevlov at the time and was also killed. Racist groups praised Markelov's killing on the Internet, but it is unclear whether they were behind it. =Natalya Estemirova= Natalya Estemirova, human rights researcher and lawyer who lived in Chechen Republic, had met sometimes well-known journalist Anna Politkovskaya and lawyer Stanislav Markelov, because they all were investigating crimes in Chechnya and defending victims rights, she also wrote reports in Novaya Gazeta. Natalya Estemirova was kidnapped on 22 July 2009 in the Chechen Capital City of Grozny and two hours later killed in neighboring Ingushetia Republic. =2009 Interview with president Dmitri Medvedev= On 13 April 2009, the newspaper was granted the first-ever print interview in a Russian publication with President Dmitri Medvedev, discussing issues such as civil society and the social contract, transparency of public officials and Internet development. =DDOS attack= On 26 January 2010, the paper's web site was subjected to a denial of service attack and effectively taken offline. As of 1 February 2010, the site was still inaccessible. At the peak of the attack the server was receiving 1.5 million connections per second.Hacker Attack Freezes Novaya Gazeta's Web Site, Nikolaus von Twickel, The Moscow Times, 1 February 2010 The newspaper maintained its online presence by publishing articles on its LiveJournal page.Blog posts related to the DDOS attack, Novaya Gazeta, 2010. On 7 April 2011, the web site was targeted again with the same botnet that appears to be used in a large scale attack on LiveJournal that hosts many opposition blogs. =Vergeef ons, Nederland= On 25 July 2014, the paper opened with \\"Vergeef ons, Nederland\\" / \\"–ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –ì–æ–ª–ª–∞–Ω–¥–∏—è\\" (\\"Forgive us, Netherlands\\" in both Dutch and Russian), in response to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster. =Investigation of Blue Whale= In early 2016 the newspaper published an article alleging existence of a so-called \\"Blue whale\\" game, seeking to cause Russian youngsters to commit suicide. The publication caused a moral panic to sweep Russia. =Denis Korotkov's investigation= After Novaya Gazeta published an investigation by journalist Denis Korotkov about a Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, in October 2018, Denis Korotkov and the editor-in-chief at Novaya Gazeta were the target of threatening deliveries of a severed ram's head and funeral flowers to the paper's offices. The style of the threat resembled others by Kremlin-linked Yevgeny Prigozhin.Six red carnations and one severed ram‚Äôs head: Deadly threats sent to Russian independent newspaper, Global Voices, 18 October 2018 =Novaya Gazeta about LGBTQ persecutions= Novaya Gazeta published reports about persecution of gays in Chechnya in 2017, where 3 men were allegedly killed, and dozens detained and intimidated. After publication, the Chechen Government denied the existence of persecutions in the Republic. =Published list of allegedly 27 Chechens lynched in Grozny on 26 January 2017= Newspaper published the report by Elena Milashina and the list of 27 Chechens killed on 26 January 2017. Newspaper also addressed the report and the list to the Russian Government service, Investigative Committee of Russia, and asked the Committee to investigate the data about the published list. While Novaya Gazeta calling names of 27 Chechens killed in the list, newspaper supposed that real number might be even more, of 56 Chechens killed that night. The newspaper said that the allegedly killed Chechens were citizens of the Republic of Chechnya, who were detained by Governmental security service, put in custody inside a guarded territory owned by Traffic Police regiment in the City of Grozny, and executed on 26 January with gunfire (several men brutally killed by asphyxiation) by State Security forces without filing any legal accusations. Elections of Editor-in-Chief Elections of editor-in-chief held in the newspaper since 2009. In November 2017, Muratov announced that he was leaving his editor-in-chief post, but would continue to work for the newspaper. On 17 November, it was announced that Sergey Kozheurov, the general director of the newspaper, had been elected to replace Muratov. Dmitriy Muratov won next elections in November, 2019.

Inserts Svobodnoe Prostranstvo (\\"Free Space\\", ), which had been a colour supplement to Novaya Gazeta, is included in the Friday issue. Novaya Gazeta regularly contain free inserts of its side-projects or other newly launched newspapers. The United Civil Front (by the corresponding organisation) and Yabloko's newspaper were published in the form of inserts in the past. Current inserts include the Shofyor (\\"Driver\\" or \\"chauffeur\\", ) side project and the popular science Kentavr (\\"Centaur\\", ). The Russian version of Le Monde diplomatique was promoted by being issued as such inserts for one year. The number of subscribers after that amounted to 43 and continuation of issuing the insert would have been considered senseless. Novaya Gazeta has also published The New York Times International Weekly on Fridays since 2009. This eight-page supplement features a selection of articles from The New York Times translated into Russian.

The new ship was launched on 9 April 1921, and made her maiden voyage on 25 May 1922 from Southampton to New York City. At the outbreak of the Second World War she was converted into an Armed Merchant Cruiser, and subsequently a troopship. Like her predecessor, sunk during the First World War, this Laconia was also destroyed by a German submarine. Some estimates of the death toll have suggested that over 1,649 people were killed when the Laconia sank. The U-boat commander Werner Hartenstein then staged a dramatic effort to rescue the passengers and the crew of Laconia, which involved additional German U-boats and became known as the Laconia incident. Description Laconia was long, with a beam of . She had a depth of and a draught of . She was powered by six steam turbines of 2,561 nhp, which drove twin screw propellors via double reduction gearing. The turbines were made by the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company, Newcastle upon Tyne. In addition to her passenger accommodation, Laconia had of refrigerated cargo space.

As a Royal Mail Ship, Laconia was entitled to display the Royal Mail \\"crown\\" logo as a part of its crest. In January 1923 Laconia began the first around-the-world cruise, which lasted 130 days and called at 22 ports. On 8 September 1925, Laconia collided with the British schooner Lucia P. Dow in the Atlantic Ocean east of Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States. Laconia towed the schooner for before handing the tow over to the American tug Resolute. In 1934, her code letters were changed to GJCD. On 24 September 1934 Laconia was involved in a collision off the US coast, while travelling from Boston to New York in dense fog. It rammed into the port side of , a US freighter. Both ships suffered serious damage but were able to proceed under their own steam. Laconia returned to New York for repairs, and resumed cruising in 1935. An early postcard depicting the lounge, the garden lounge, the dining salon, and the smoking room on the Laconia Drafted into war service Australians manning a 6-inch gun, 22 March 1942 On 4 September 1939, Laconia was requisitioned by the Admiralty and converted into an armed merchant cruiser. By January 1940 she had been fitted with eight six-inch guns and two three-inch high-angle guns. After trials off the Isle of Wight, she embarked gold bullion and sailed for Portland, Maine and Halifax, Nova Scotia on 23 January. She spent the next few months escorting convoys to Bermuda and to points in the mid-Atlantic, where they would join up with other convoys. On 9 June, she ran aground in the Bedford Basin at Halifax, suffering considerable damage, and repairs were not completed till the end of July. In October her passenger accommodation was dismantled and some areas filled with oil drums to provide extra buoyancy so that she would stay afloat longer if torpedoed. During the period June‚ÄìAugust 1941 Laconia returned to St John, New Brunswick and was refitted, then returned to Liverpool to be used as a troop transport for the rest of the war. On 12 September 1941, she arrived at Bidston Dock, Birkenhead and was taken over by Cammell Laird and Company to be converted. By early 1942 the work was complete, and for the next six months she made trooping voyages to the Middle East. On one such voyage the ship was used to carry prisoners of war, mainly Italian. She travelled to Cape Town and then set a course for Freetown, following a zigzag course and undertaking evasive steering during the night. Final moments Laconia \\"Saloon Passenger List\\" 7 August 1926 On 12 September 1942, at 8:10 pm, north-northeast of Ascension Island, Laconia was hit on the starboard side by a torpedo fired by U-boat . There was an explosion in the hold and many of the Italian prisoners aboard were killed instantly. The vessel immediately took a list to starboard and settled heavily by the stern. Captain Rudolph Sharp, who had also commanded another Cunard liner, when she was sunk by enemy action, was gaining control over the situation when a second torpedo hit Number Two hold. At the time of the attack, the Laconia was carrying 268 British soldiers, 160 Polish soldiers (who were on guard), 80 civilians, and 1,800 Italian prisoners of war. Captain Sharp ordered the ship abandoned and the women, children and injured taken into the lifeboats first. By this time, the ship's stern deck was awash. Some of the 32 lifeboats had been destroyed by the explosions. According to Italian survivors, many of the POWs were left locked in the holds, and those who escaped and tried to board lifeboats and liferafts were shot or bayoneted by British and Polish soldiers. While most British and Polish troops and crew survived, only 415 Italians were rescued, out of 1,809 who had been on board. At 9:11 pm Laconia sank, stern first, her bow rising to be vertical, with Sharp himself and many of the Italian prisoners still on board. The prospects for those who escaped the ship were only slightly better; sharks were common in the area and the lifeboats were adrift in the mid- Atlantic with little hope of rescue. Boiler installation of the Laconia in 1922. When Kapit√§nleutnant Werner Hartenstein, commanding officer of U-156, realized civilians and prisoners of war were on board, he surfaced to rescue survivors, and asked BdU (the U-Boat Command in Germany) for help. Several U-boats were dispatched; all flew Red Cross flags, and signalled by radio that a rescue operation was underway. The next morning, a U.S. B-24 Liberator plane sighted the rescue efforts. Hartenstein signaled the pilot for assistance, who then notified the American base on Ascension Island of the situation. The senior officer on duty there, Robert C. Richardson III, claimed to be unaware Bridgland, Tony. Waves of Hate: Naval Atrocities of the 2nd World War. p. 80 :\\"Nobody told us anything about Hartenstein's message.

Despite the Liberator crew clearly seeing the Red Cross flags, they pressed home their attack. The survivors crowded on the submarines' decks and the towed lifeboats, as the B-24 made several deadly attack runs on U-156. The Germans ordered their submarines to dive, abandoning many survivors. After the incident, Admiral Karl D√∂nitz issued the Laconia Order, henceforth ordering his commanders not to rescue survivors after attacks. Vichy French ships rescued 1,083 persons from the lifeboats and took aboard those picked up by the four submarines, and in all around 1,500 survived the sinking. Other sources state that only 1,083 survived and an estimated 1,658 persons died (98 crew members, 133 passengers, 33 Polish guards and 1,394 Italian prisoners).

In sexual roleplay, it involves acting out roles of coercive sex. Rape pornography is literature or images associated with rape and sometimes Stockholm syndrome as a means of sexual arousal.  Fantasy  Studies have found rape fantasy is a common sexual fantasy among both men and women . The fantasy may involve the fantasist as either the one being forced into sex or being the perpetrator. A 1974 study by Hariton and Singer found that being \\"overpowered or forced to surrender\\" was the second most frequent fantasy in their survey; a 1984 study by Knafo and Jaffe ranked being overpowered as their study's most common fantasy during intercourse. In 1985, Louis H. Janda, an associate professor of psychology at Old Dominion University, said that the sexual fantasy of being raped is the most common sexual fantasy for women. A 1988 study by Pelletier and Herold found that over half of their female respondents had fantasies of forced sex. The most frequently cited hypothesis for why women fantasize of being forced and coerced into some sexual activity is that the fantasy avoids societally induced guilt‚Äîthe woman does not have to admit responsibility for her sexual desires and behavior. A 1978 study by Moreault and Follingstad was consistent with this hypothesis, and found that women with high levels of sex guilt were more likely to report fantasy themed around being overpowered, dominated, and helpless. In contrast, Pelletier and Herold used a different measure of guilt and found no correlation. Other research suggests that women who report forced sex fantasies have a more positive attitude towards sexuality, contradicting the guilt hypothesis. A 1998 study by Strassberg and Lockerd found that women who fantasized about force were generally less guilty and more erotophilic, and as a result had more frequent and varied fantasies. However, it said that force fantasies are not the most common or the most frequent. 45.8% of men in a 1980 study reported fantasizing during heterosexual intercourse about \\"a scene where [they had] the impression of being raped by a woman\\" (3.2% often and 42.6% sometimes), 44.7% of scenes where a seduced woman \\"pretends resisting\\" and 33% of raping a woman. A male sexual fantasy of raping a woman may bring sexual arousal either from imagining a scene in which first a woman objects but then comes to like and eventually participate in the intercourse, or else one in which the woman does not like it and arousal is associated with the idea of hurting the woman. A study of college-age women in 1998 found over half had engaged in fantasies of rape or coercion which, another study suggests, are simply \\"open and unrestricted\\" expressions of female sexuality.  Roleplay  One form of sexual roleplaying is the rape fantasy, also called ravishment or forced sex roleplay. In BDSM circles (and occasionally outside these circles as well), some people choose to roleplay rape scenes‚Äîwith communication, consent and safety being especially crucial elements. Though consent is a crucial component of any sexual roleplay, the illusion of non- consent (i.e. rape) is important to maintaining this type of fantasy. A safe word is therefore a common safety measure, given that words that would normally halt sexual activity (e.g. \\"stop\\") are often disregarded in these scenes.

Like all members of their class, they are Gram-negative. The order is divided into six families: Nitrosomonadaceae (type family) comprises the genera Nitrosomonas (type genus), Nitrosolobus and Nitrosospira. Methylophilaceae comprises the genera Methylophilus (type genus), Methylobacillus and Methylovorus. Spirillaceae comprises the genus Spirillum (type genus) Thiobacillaceae comprises the genera Thiobacillus (type genus), Annwoodia, Sulfuritortus. Gallionellaceae comprises the genera Gallionella (type genus), Ferriphaselus, Sulfuriferula, Sulfurirhabdus and Sulfuricella. Sterolibacteraceae comprises the genera Sterolibacterium, Sulfurisoma, Denitratisoma, Sulfuritalea, Georgfuchsia, Sulfurisoma and Methyloversatilis. Members of the genus Nitrosomonas oxidize ammonium ions into nitrite, \\\\- a process called nitrification - and are important in the nitrogen cycle. Other autotrophic genera such as Thiobacillus and Annwoodia oxidize reduced inorganic sulfur ions such as thiosulfate and sulfide into sulfate and have key roles in the sulfur cycle. Methylotrophs such as Methylophilus oxidize compounds such as methanol into carbon dioxide and are key to the carbon cycle. Gallionella and Ferriphaselus oxidise ferric iron (Fe3+) ions into ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3) during autotrophic growth, and thus have roles in the carbon cycle and the iron cycle. As such, the Nitrosomonadales are critical to biogeochemical cycling of the elements and many species have key roles in principal biochemical processes.

He served as the 11th Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba between 1929 and 1934. McGregor was born in Amherstburg, Canada West (now Ontario), and was educated at public schools in Windsor. He did not attend college. He moved to Manitoba in 1877, and worked in his father's cattle business in Brandon. McGregor was one of several pioneers to the Yukon following the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, and served as Mine Inspector of the Yukon Territory from 1897 to 1899. He subsequently bought a ranch near Medicine Hat (now in Alberta), and owned 200,000 acres (800 km¬≤) with 10,000 head of cattle and 2,000 horses. For ten years, McGregor also managed the British-owned Canada Land and Irrigation Company and helped build reservoirs and canal systems near Milo, in Vulcan County, Alberta. McGregor Lake, a 40 kilometres-long irrigation reservoir in the Oldman River drainage basin, was named for McGregor. McGregor gained international fame for his pioneering efforts in stock breeding. He was the first farmer to cultivate alfalfa in the western provinces, thereby reducing the region's dependency on the wheat market. He also founded the Glencarnock stock farms of western Canada, and won a number of international livestock prizes. McGregor never actually ran for public office, despite repeated entreaties. In 1915, he declined an appointment as Minister of Agriculture in Manitoba. Two years later, he was appointed wartime leader of the Food Control Board in the western provinces, holding the position for a year. When Theodore Arthur Burrows died in 1929, McGregor was called to succeed him as Manitoba's Lieutenant-Governor (a largely ceremonial position, though McGregor was significant in being the first non-politician to be so appointed). He held this position for five years, and died shortly thereafter.

It is made of wood, with a heavy, gently sloping roof and wide, well-supported eaves set at right angles to the front of the house.Webster's Dictionary defines a chalet as \\"A wooden dwelling with a sloping roof and widely overhanging eaves, common in Switzerland and other Alpine regions.\\" Definition and origin The term chalet stems from Arpitan speaking part of Switzerland and French Savoy and originally referred to the hut of a herder. It was often embedded in the ground for sake of temperature buffering. A 'chalet' in the hills to the east of Oros√≠, Costa Rica Many chalets in the European Alps were originally used as seasonal farms for dairy cattle which would be brought up from the lowland pastures during the summer months. The herders would live in the chalet and make butter and cheese in order to preserve the milk produced. These products would then be taken, with the cattle, back to the low valleys before the onset of the alpine winter. The chalets would remain locked and unused during the winter months. Around many chalets there are small windowless huts called mazots which were used to lock away valuable items for this period.  Modern international usage  Hagere Selam (Ethiopia) around 1970 With the emergence of the Alpine travel business, chalets were transformed into holiday homes used by ski and hiking enthusiasts. Over the years, the term 'chalet' changed to be applied generally to holiday homes, whether built in a strictly Alpine style or not. In Quebec French, any summer or holiday dwelling, especially near a ski hill, is called a chalet whether or not it is built in the style of a Swiss chalet. A holiday 'chalet' in the Blue Ridge Mountains Nowadays, in North America and elsewhere in the world, the use of the word chalet can refer to more than just a mountain location. The term chalet is even used to describe resort-like homes or residential properties located by the beach. For example, in Lebanon a chalet usually refers to holiday homes at one of the six Lebanese ski resorts, but the term can also refer to a beach cabin at seaside resorts.Pierce, Eleanor B. All You Need to Know about Living Abroad: Pan American's Guide to Living Conditions in 93 Countries In North American ski areas, the word chalet is also used to describe buildings that house cafeterias and other services provided to the tourist, even though they may not resemble a traditional Alpine chalet. In the United States, Alpine ski chalets are gaining popularity in Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region during winter months. Most ski chalets are privately owned vacation homes that owners visit two to three times per year and rent out the remaining time. Owners of these ski chalets often hire property management companies to manage and rent their property. In the Levant, Egypt, and Kuwait and in the Italian region of Marche, chalets refer to beach houses, rather than mountainside homes, and built in any style of architecture. In Britain, the word chalet was used for basic sleeping accommodation at holiday camps built around the mid-20th century.Butlins FAQ , Butlins Memories.

The term \\"Oriente\\" is still used to refer to the eastern part of the country, which currently is divided into five different provinces. Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro were born in a small town in this province (Bir√°n). The origins of Oriente lie in the 1607 division of Cuba into a western and eastern administration. The eastern part was governed from Santiago de Cuba and it was subordinate to the national government in Havana. In 1807, Cuba was divided into three departamentos: Occidental, Central and Oriental. This arrangement lasted until 1851, when the central department was merged back into the West. In 1878, Cuba was divided into six provinces. Oriente remained intact but was officially renamed to Santiago de Cuba Province until the name was reverted back to Oriente in 1905. This lasted until 1976, when the province was split into five different provinces: Las Tunas Province, Granma Province, Holgu√≠n Province, Santiago de Cuba Province, and Guant√°namo Province. This administrative change was proclaimed by Cuban Law Number 1304 of July 3, 1976,Fifth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, Vol. II, published by the United Nations, New York, 1991 and remains in place to this day. History Diego Velazquez founded the capital of Oriente province in 1514 and named it Santiago de Cuba. The province comprises 22 municipalities and is Cuba's largest province containing about one third of the country's population. Oriente Province is in the most eastern region of Cuba with a population of 1,797,606.^‚ÄùOriente- Cuba‚Äù. Cuban Commemorative Coins.

Some of Cuba's oldest cities are in Oriente Province (such as Baracoa) and carry a rich history of Cuba's struggle for independence and racial equality. Throughout the 1800s. a significant amount of African slaves were brought to Cuba to work at the sugar mills, although some were brought from Haiti and other neighboring islands because they were also cheap and efficient labor. Open warfare broke out after an independence movement and lasted from 1867 to 1878.^ \\"Cuba.\\" The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. ¬© 1994, 2000-2006 on Infoplease. ¬© 2000‚Äì2007 Pearson Education, publishing as Infoplease. 09 Mar. 2010 . Slavery was finally abolished in 1886, but life for many Afro-Cubans remains a struggle, especially in Oriente Province. After the occupation of the Spanish ended in 1899, Oriente Province became a refuge for Afro-Cubans. Oriente had the highest number of individual land owners and renters with 96% of the population being native-born. Afro-Cubans constituted as many as 26% of the land workers. Of the total land owned by Afro-Cubans, 75% were in Oriente Province.^‚ÄúOn the Importance of Oriente Province‚Äù. History of Cuba. 02 Feb. 2010 http://www.historyofcuba.com/cuba.htm Even though Afro- Cubans fared better in Oriente, poverty was still rampant in the province and they remained oppressed by wealthy Cubans and foreign land owners. Sugar and coffee were the main agricultural products produced. And at the highest there were forty-one sugar mills spread throughout the region. Foreign investors saw opportunity within the province and began to buy as much land as possible to increase sugar production. As investors bought land, local farmers were pushed out and frustration increased. Poverty grew and by May 1912 Cubans in Oriente Province had reached a boiling point. Massive demonstrations erupted and Afro- Cubans began to loot and burn businesses and property owned by foreign investors. In response, the Cuban government sent in the army to burn the property of the Afro-Cubans and slaughtered many. Within two years, half of the sugar mills in Oriente were owned by U.S. investors. For Cubans working within the province, life had become near unbearable. The presence of Americans, Jamaicans, Bahamians and Haitians, brought in by the United Fruit Company exacerbated racial problems not present until the U.S. occupation of 1898.

Benson to distinguish him from his great-grandson of the same name) was an apostle and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Early life Benson was born in Mendon, Massachusetts, the son of John Benson and Chloe Taft. His father moved to a farm in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, in 1817 where he lived for at least 16 of the next 18 years. Benson married Pamelia Andrus of Northbridge on January 1, 1832, at Uxbridge. They lived at Uxbridge for the next three years, between 1832 and 1835. Benson also had lived in Northbridge, on his sister's farm in 1830 and 1831. He and Pamelia had children, one of whom died at Uxbridge in 1833. Benson managed a hotel in the center of Uxbridge and made a considerable sum of money which he invested in a cotton mill at Holland, Massachusetts, He moved to Holland in 1835 and became postmaster, before moving West. Conversion to Mormonism and church leadership Benson and his wife were baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on July 19, 1840, in Quincy, Illinois. He had moved to Quincy previously, and first met members of the church when they came there at the time they were driven out of Missouri. In April 1841, the Bensons moved to Nauvoo. Benson was ordained to the office of apostle on July 16, 1846. He replaced John E. Page in the Quorum of the Twelve. Benson arrived in the Salt Lake Valley as one of the first 148 Mormon settlers with the vanguard company of 1847, also known as the Brigham Young Pioneer Company. The company left Winter Quarters, Nebraska, on April 16, 1847, and arrived in the Salt Lake Valley between July 21 and July 24, 1847. Missionary service Benson served as a church missionary in the United States and in the Sandwich Islands. Benson's first mission in the 1840s took him to his birthplace of Mendon, Massachusetts. On this journey he also preached in Chambersburg, Illinois. During his second mission, Benson was in New Jersey, serving with John Pack, when they received news of Joseph Smith's murder. From December 1844 to May 1845, Benson served a mission to New England, during which he served as president of the Boston Conference. Political career Benson served in the Utah Territorial Legislature. Family Like many early Latter Day Saints, Benson practiced plural marriage. On April 27, 1844, Benson married his first plural wife, Adeline Brooks Andrus, the sister of Pamelia.Dew, Sheri. Ezra Taft Benson: A Biography. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1987) p. 4‚Äì5. After moving to Utah, Benson married Adeline Brooks Andrus, Desdemona Fullmer (a widow of Joseph Smith), Eliza Ann Perry, Lucinda West, Elizabeth Gollaher, Olive Mary Knight, and Mary Larsen. Benson had eight wives and 35 children. He also owned a few Paiute slaves. Benson's great-grandson, also named Ezra Taft Benson, also became an apostle of the LDS Church; the younger Benson served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in the 1950s and president of the LDS Church from 1985 to 1994. Death and burial Benson died suddenly from a heart attack on September 3, 1869, while in Ogden, Utah Territory. He is buried in the Logan City Cemetery in Logan, Utah.

The process involves creating an easily visualized scene that will link the words together. One example is the Russian word for cow (–∫–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞, pronounced roughly karova): think and visualize \\"I ran my car over a cow.\\" It has a long history of software versions in its native United Kingdom being available for the Sinclair, Acorn and BBC Micro computers as well as a variety of audio and book editions over the years. Discussion of the method Many teachers and students of language have used the same technique, and many examples have been used independently by many people (e.g., to remember that in Thai, khao means rice, imagine a cow eating rice). One of the drawbacks of such methods is that it takes a lot of effort to create a scene for every new word. Linkword has the advantage of offering ready made scenes for each word, so hundreds of words can be memorized in a few hours. However, it offers only a basic vocabulary (e.g. 200 words for a survival course and around 1400 words for a 4-level course). Proponents of the method say that the effort to create a scene for a new word is less than or equal to the time required to memorize the word using other techniques (e.g. flashcards, Spaced repetition, and repeatedly saying a word out loud). Another criticism of mnemonic techniques such as this is that they tend to assume a one-to-one relationship between the learner's first language and the target language. In reality, words often have a different range of meanings, and so the student must learn the complexity or nuance of the new words. For this reason, such techniques may be seen as a useful and powerful way to progress in the language, especially in the early stages, rather than giving a complete understanding. Critics also say that because the method relies on the coincidental similarities in the sounds of words, it cannot be used to teach all, or even most, words of another language as there may be no corresponding phonetically similar words or visualizations that could be used. In practice, however, there is usually a visualization that can be used, but for some words it is a less direct connection and not as effective. In these cases, there is more need for other learning methods to support the visualization, such as repetition and flashcards. The system is similar to a well-known trick of some stage mnemonists employed for memorizing huge lists of words suggested by spectators to repeat them in any given order, forwards, backwards, even ones, etc., known as mnemonic peg system. A mnemonist has his own \\"counting list\\" of words. Each counting word is bound to the next spectator's word by means of a sentence, as described above. Some mnemonists claim the sillier the binding sentence, the easier it is to remember. While this method could be used to teach from any language to any language, it is currently used almost exclusively to teach English speaking people other languages. Many different companies offer systems based on this method, but the list of languages offered is almost identical. Learning courses have been developed to teach students Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (both Brazilian and European), Russian, Spanish (both European and South American) and Welsh.

It is located at Kilometre 1,632 (historical mile 1016) of the Alaska Highway at its junction with the Haines Highway, hence the name of the community. According to the 2016 Census, the population was 613.Population and dwelling counts Statistics Canada Haines Junction is east of Kluane National Park and Reserve. It is a major administrative centre for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. History For around two thousand years, the Southern Tutchone people had seasonal hunting and fishing camps in the area of present-day Haines Junction. The original name of the area was \\"Dakwakada\\", a Southern Tutchone word meaning \\"high cache\\". It was common for Tutchone people to use raised log caches to store food year-round or temporarily while they hunted and fished in an area. The Haines Junction area was also important for trade between the coastal and interior peoples. It lies at the interior end of the Chilkat Pass, one of only three passes that allowed travel between the coast and the interior, which was used extensively for trade between the coastal Tlingit and Southern Tutchone people. The current town of Haines Junction was established in 1942 and 1943 during the construction of the Alaska Highway. In 1943, a second highway, the Haines Highway, was built to connect the Alaska Highway with the coastal town of Haines, Alaska, over the Chilkat Pass. Situated at the junction of these two highways, Haines Junction was a construction camp and a supply and service centre for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers building the highway. The Haines‚ÄìFairbanks petroleum pipeline was constructed in 1953‚Äì55, and a pumping station was built just north of Haines Junction.http://www.arlis.org/docs/vol1/AlaskaGas/Report4/Report_CEMML_2003_HainesFairbanksPipeline.pdf Demographics Transportation Haines Junction Airport By road, Haines Junction is served by the Alaska Highway and the Haines Highway (Yukon Highway 3). By air, it is served by the Haines Junction Airport. Climate Haines Junction has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with mild summers and long, severely cold and snowy winters, with annual snowfall averaging 64.5 inches (164 cm).

He served three times as Spanish Prime Minister: from 27 October 1913 to 9 December 1915, from 11 June 1917 to 3 November 1917, and from 28 April 1920 until his assassination by Catalan anarchists. Also he held eleven cabinet ministries, and was four times President of the Spanish Congress of Deputies (a role akin to that of parliamentary Speaker). Career Born in A Coru√±a, Spain, son of Carlos Dato y Granados (himself the son of Carlos Dato Camacho y Mar√≠n and wife Cayetana Ruperta Granados y Garc√≠a, de Vivancos e Acosta) and wife Rosa Lorenza Iradier e Arce, of Galician descent. He graduated in Law at the Complutense University in 1875. He opened his law office two years later. Elected to the Spanish parliament in 1883, he became Under-secretary for the Ministry of the Interior in 1892.

Assassination On 8 March 1921 in Madrid, while being driven from the parliament building and in front of the Puerta de Alcal√°, Dato was assassinated by three Catalan anarchists, Luis Nicolau, Pedro Mateu, and Ram√≥n Casanellas, who were riding a motorcycle. This was the second murder of a Spanish prime minister in less than a decade; in 1912 Jos√© Canalejas had been killed similarly. King Alfonso XIII of Spain posthumously made him a Duke by bestowing the title \\"Duchess of Dato\\" on his widow.

Taxonomy The species was first described by Albert G√ºnther in 1867. It is placed in the Rhynchoedura genus, which are found throughout Australasia. This group shares characteristics with several species of Diplodactylus, the conspicillatus group, Glen Storr has suggested that these could be transferred to this genus. Many of the characters of this species are found in Diplodactylus stenodactylus, their appearance, habitat and distribution, and Diplodactylus pulcher has a similar snout and vertebrae. Synonyms for this species include Diplodactylus paraornatus and Rhynchoedura ormsbyi published by Wells & Wellington. Research into the phylogenetic relationships of Diplodactylus has identified two clades, and the resurrection of Lucasium has been proposed. Rhynchoedura was found to be distinct from D. byrnei, D. steindachneri and the stenodactylus group, but may be considered as a sister group to these. Description It is a small nocturnal gecko up to 95 millimetres, snout vent length to 50 mm, with a long slender tail. The snout is narrow and beak-like, its characteristic pinched head readily distinguishes it from other gecko species. Occasionally the species is found beneath shrubs, but it most often shelters in the abandoned burrows of spiders and other lizards. It is reddish-brown to red above, with tiny yellow, brown, and white spots. A light brown or grey colour is found on the head. A creamy or white stripe extends from below the eyes, the lower surface of the body is stark white. Its favored prey are termites. The small digits of the species are slender and clawed. The small beak structure is formed by the projections of the rostral and mental shields. Preanal pores are present. This gecko regulates its temperature by moving to warmer or cooler positions. The female of the species is often larger and matures at an early age, less than 1 year, which allows greater development of its eggs for increased viability of its offspring. They produce two leathery eggs. It is an endangered species, listed as a Schedule 4, requiring an \\"advanced\\" license to own and written notice of any transactions involving it, according to Victorian wildlife laws. Distribution and habitat The western beaked gecko is widespread and common across Australia, primarily in its interior. It is found in arid to semi-arid regions of the country, in a wide variety of habitats and soil types. Its range covers New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, and West Australia. It does not occur on southern coastal regions or in the tropical north. The distribution in Western Australia is in northeastern parts of Southwest Australia, extending to the northern and northwest coasts. Its type location is Nicol Bay, Western Australia. The habitat may be sand hills or plains, often associated with Triodia, and country such as mallee and mulga. The individuals maintain a small range, around 30 metres, during their lifetime.

History First published in 1982Kerekes, David & Slater, David, Critical Vision: Random Essays & Tracts Concerning Sex, Religion and Death, Stockport, Cheshire, UK: Headpress (1995) pp. 30-32 the comic series was originally called Cherry Poptart, but the title was changed to Cherry beginning with Issue #3, explained by Welz as his response to litigation or threats of litigation by Kellogg's over its Pop-Tarts trademark.Skinn, Dez, Comix: The Underground Revolution Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, NY (2004) pp. 71‚Äì73. It has also been suggested that Welz decided that the \\"Cherry\\" name alone was better as a brand and looked better as a logo.Markstein, Don \\"Cherry Poptart\\", Toonopedia Inside the comic Cherry's name was changed to Cherry Popstar, and that name was used in a number of stories,For example see issues #7, #9, and #13. but she was most frequently referred to by just her first name. The original series has also spawned a spinoff title in 1992 ‚Äì Cherry's Jubilee ‚Äì which ran four issues, and featured stories from other writers and artists alongside work by Welz. In addition, individual issues are collected in a series of Cherry Collections. Welz has also produced an issue called Cherry Deluxe featuring a story by Neil Gaiman. The original publisher of the comic was Last Gasp through Issue 13. Kitchen Sink Press published issues 14‚Äì15, as well as reprinting the Last Gasp issues with some modifications (mostly ads). Beginning with issue 16, Welz formed Cherry Comics which currently publishes Cherry and related titles. Again, earlier issues were modified for the new printings, and some bear a \\"Second Edition\\" mark. Though the comic is largely known as an erotic or pornographic book, it does garner critical merit for its humor and occasional political commentary.Wagner, Hank, Golden, Christoper & Bissette, Stephen, Prince of Stories: The Many Worlds of Neil Gaiman St. Martin's Press, New York NY (2009) p 287 The Cherry character has also appeared in several free speech/censorship awareness campaigns.David, Peter (April 27, 2001). \\"The CBLDF: Perception vs. reality\\". The Comics Buyer's Guide #1432. Archived at peterdavid.net. The series is among the largest-selling of the underground comics, and is among those titles credited with reviving that genre.Halperin, James Heritage Comics #810 Ivy Press (April 2004) Contrasting the subject matter with more \\"innocent\\" connotations, Welz draws the comic in a simple style reminiscent of Dan DeCarlo, whose style was also the basis for the Archie comic book series, though he does experiment with different drawing styles, including a 3D edition. The strip so closely followed the \\"Happy Teenager\\" genre typified by Archie that lawsuits were threatened, but these failed to stop Welz, who overtly lampooned the Archie characters in the story \\"Vampironica\\", though that particular story was pulled from subsequent printings. Cast = Family = *Cherry‚Äî The main character is a high school student who is described by the comic's publishers as \\"blonde, cute, sexy, fun, friendly & smart.\\" Her character is bisexual, promiscuous, has small breasts, and can seemingly become sexually aroused simply by breathing.

She was ranked 82nd in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. *Pepper‚Äî Cherry's mother, a divorced MILF, Pepper is a grown-up version of Cherry, looking very similar and apparently having the same sexual appetites.

She appeared in one single-page mini-story in issue No 2 in which she was indignant about not being allowed to perform any sex acts in the comic, due to being underage.Cherry #2 She is implied to be about 16, since she mentioned she could drive. Welz explained in The Gauntlet in 1992 that the issue and the character were intended to address the serious issue of concerns raised by his publisher that if Cherry was depicted as being under 18, the strip could be classified as child pornography. =Boyfriends= *Johnny Fuckerfaster ‚Äî Cherry's best male friend. *Ronnie ‚Äî A boy with a \\"tuff\\" car on whom she performed oral sex so she could drive (and subsequently wreck) the car.Cherry #1 \\"Hot Rod Boogie\\" *Joey ‚Äî A sexual partner who helps her with her homework.Cherry #2 \\"Good Ol' Mom\\" *Steve ‚Äî Cherry's \\"boyfriend\\". =Girlfriends= *Ellie Dee ‚Äî Cherry's best friend, Ellie is tall, slender, and dark-haired, and wears large, round eyeglasses.

There are two main categories of plucked idiophones, those that are in the form of a frame (121) and those that are in the form of a comb (122). Parts of a lamellaphone are bicycle spokes..etc African lamellophones A Kouxian, played by plucking the ends in front of the oral cavity. The lamellae resonate to produce sound. A large number of lamellophones originate in Africa, where they are known under different names including mbira, sanza, kisanji, likembe, kalimba, and kongoma. They play a role in southeast African Music. They were reported as early as the 16th century, but there is no doubt they have a much longer history. The Caribbean mar√≠mbula is also of this family. The mar√≠mbula can be seen as a bass variant of the mbira and is sometimes used in hiphop music. In most cases the tongues are divided in two playing halves with the lowest notes in the centre; from there to the left and to the right each tongue is tuned higher than the previous one. The tongues may also be arranged in a linear arrangement in the manner of a piano. Tongues may be made small enough to play with individual fingers, hence the colloquial name \\"thumb piano\\". (Although some instruments, like the Mbira, have an additional rows of tongues, in which case not just the thumbs are used for plucking.) Some conjecture that African lamellophones were derived from xylophones and marimbas. However, similar instruments have been found elsewhere; for example, the indigenous peoples of Siberia play wooden and metallic lamellophones with a single tongue. Lamellophones may be made with or without resonators. There are also electric lamellophones with an additional pickup. Whale Drum with 8 tongues (from Emil Richards Collection) Schaeffner's classification Schaeffner's musical instrument classification scheme has a post-prominent place for the linguaphones (lamellophones) at the second highest level of classification. In 1932, Andre Schaeffner developed a new classification scheme that was \\"exhaustive, potentially covering all real and conceivable instruments\\" [Kartomi, p. 176]. Schaeffner's system has only two top-level categories denoted by Roman numerals (Schaeffner, A.: Origine des instruments de musique, pp. 371‚Äì377.): *I: instruments that make sound from vibrating solids; IA Solids not susceptibles of tension (equivalent to a big part of Hornbostel & Sachs idiophones); IB Flexible solids (equivalent to mainly linguaphones); IC Tensionable solids (equivalent to both membranophones and chordophones); *II: instruments that make sound from vibrating air (aerophones).

He served as the province's 12th Lieutenant Governor from 1934 to 1940. Tupper was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the son of Charles Tupper (who later served as Premier of Nova Scotia from 1863 to 1867, and Prime Minister of Canada in 1896) and Frances Am√©lia Morse. He was named in honour of his father's mentor James William Johnston. He was educated at Upper Canada College and Harvard Law School but returned to Nova Scotia to practice law, being called to the bar in 1885. Later in the same year, Tupper enlisted as a private in the Canadian army to assist in putting down the Northwest Rebellion, and remained in Manitoba afterwards. He was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1886, and worked in a Winnipeg law firm with Hugh John Macdonald, son of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. In 1887, he married Margaret, the daughter of James McDonald. He was named a King's Counsel in 1912. Tupper also served as president of the Army and Navy Veterans in Canada. Tupper entered political life in the 1914 provincial election, running as a Conservative in the rural provincial riding of Morden and Rhineland. He lost to incumbent Liberal Valentine Winkler, 1,073 votes to 971. Tupper ran against Winkler again in the 1915 election, and lost again by an increased margin amid a disastrous provincial defeat for his party. In the 1920 election, Tupper was one of two Conservatives elected to the provincial legislature for Winnipeg, which elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. He finished second on his party's list, behind John Thomas Haig. Tupper was one of only eight Conservative MLAs in the legislature, and there is no indication that he played a major role in parliament. He ran for re- election in the 1922 campaign, but finished 21st overall on first-preference votes and was eliminated on the 24th count. In 1931, Tupper was elected president of the Law Society of Manitoba, holding the position for three years. Tupper was sworn in as lieutenant governor on December 1, 1934, and served until November 1, 1940. The position was largely ceremonial by this time, and Tupper had little influence over the government of John Bracken. He died in Winnipeg in 1947.

In Cuba it is common in the chang√º√≠ genre, as well as old styles of son. In Mexico, where it is known as marimbol is played in son jarocho; in the Dominican Republic, where it is known as marimba, it is played in merengue t√≠pico, and in Jamaica it is known as rumba box and played in mento. Unlike typical African lamellophones, such as the mbira, used to produce complex polyphony and polyrhythms, the marimbula usually plays the role of a bass guitar, i.e. providing the rhythmic and harmonic support for a band, although it can produce a simple melody as well. Designs of marimbulas vary greatly, in terms of the material of resonator, the number and arrangement of keys, the overall arrangement and size of the instrument and the way it is played. Characteristics It consists of a wood box with a sound hole cut in the center of it. Across this hole, a number of metal strips are attached at one end to the resonating box. These metal strips are tuned to different pitches, and are plucked to produce a bassline for the music. The mar√≠mbula is usually classified as part of the lamellophone family of musical instruments. History With its roots in African instruments, the marimbula originated in the province of Oriente, Cuba, in the 19th century. Eventually it spread throughout the Caribbean, the Americas, and Africa, from Liberia to the Congo. By the 1930s it had made its way to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, other Caribbean islands, Mexico, and as far away as New York City. The Cubans call it mar√≠mbula, and most of the other Caribbean countries have adopted this name or some variant of it: marimba, malimba, manimba, marimbol. The instrument has a number of other names, such as mar√≠mbola (Puerto Rico), bass box, calimba (calymba), rhumba box, Church & Clap, Jazz Jim or Lazy Bass (Jamaica), and box lamellophone. : African slaves of the Caribbean made musical instruments from whatever stray material they could lay their hands on. Early marimbulas were made from discarded wooden packing crates, with tongues (keys) made of springy wood, bamboo, old hack-saw blades, all kinds of discarded springs, etc. The musician sits on top of the box reaching down to pluck the tongues whilst slapping the sides of the box like a drum. The instrument's evolution and playing style is similar to the cajon box drum. This instrument was very important in the development of Afro-Cuban music as it was one of the basic instruments played by chang√º√≠ musicians. Both chang√º√≠ and son genres developed as a result of the combination of African and Spanish musical styles and instrumentation. Thus, chang√º√≠ musicians still play a pair of tack-head bongos, mar√≠mbula, a pair of maracas, g√ºiro, and tres to accompany the voice of the vocalist and chorus. Most of the above-mentioned instruments are handmade folk instruments, made from locally available materials, as opposed to commercially produced instruments. The oldest surviving recordings of the mar√≠mbula in Cuba were made by Terceto Yoyo and Sexteto Habanero in 1925. This was one of the many instruments imported from the Americas to Africa, which continue to be played to this day, in various forms and styles, particularly in the countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Ghana and Nigeria. The mar√≠mbula became quite popular in Jamaica in conjunction with guitars, drums, maracas, and vocals in the churches, where it was known as church and clap, in nightclubs where it was known as jazz jim, and among the various hotel performers, who played mento music. It can still be found in use by mento musicians such as The Jolly Boys. Currently, the instrument is regaining popularity among hip hop artists and mbira players, like Chartwell Dutiro and The Jolly Boys.

Rising in the Saint Cyr Range of the Pelly Mountains in southeastern Yukon, it flows southeast through British Columbia, marking the northern end of the Rocky Mountains and then curving northeast back into Yukon and Northwest Territories, draining into the Mackenzie River at Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories. The river drains approximately of boreal forest and muskeg. Geography The river habitats are a subsection of the Lower Mackenzie Freshwater Ecoregion. The area around the river in Yukon is called the Liard River Valley, and the Alaska Highway follows the river for part of its route. This surrounding area is also referred to as the Liard Plain, and is a physiographic section of the larger Yukon‚ÄìTanana Uplands province, which in turn is part of the larger Intermontane Plateaus physiographic division. The Liard River is a crossing area for Nahanni wood bison. History The origin of the river's name is obscure, but is derived from the French word for \\"Eastern Cottonwood\\" (a kind of poplar) which grow in abundance along sections of the river. Among the early fur traders, the Liard above the Fort Nelson River was referred to as the \\"West Branch,\\" while the Fort Nelson River was the \\"East Branch.\\" The first European to traverse most of the river was John McLeod of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Leaving Fort Simpson on June 28, 1831, McLeod and eight others ascended the river, reaching and naming the Dease River in just over six weeks. Four days later, they reached the Frances River, and mistakenly ascended it, thinking it was the Liard's main branch. Nine years later, another HBC employee, Robert Campbell, journeyed to the source of the Liard in the St. Cyr Range, renaming the river McLeod had ascended for Frances Ramsay Simpson, the wife of the Sir George Simpson, the HBC's governor who had authorised both expeditions. Features *The Grand Canyon of the Liard is a stretch of the river beginning just east of Liard River Hotsprings. It contains numerous class IV and higher rapids. It is located between the Toad and Trout Rivers' confluences with the Liard. The area was the site of extensive study in the late 1970s and early 1980s by BC Hydro for a potential hydroelectric dam. The location, initially known as Site E, later renamed to Devil‚Äôs Gorge, was intended as one of a number of potential sister projects to the Site C Dam on the Peace River. Though questions of feasibility and British Columbia‚Äôs future electricity needs would lead to the project, along with British Columbia‚Äôs other Site projects, being shelved in favour of Site C. *The Liard Canyon is a separate canyon from the Grand Canyon, and is located near Lower Post. *Liard River Hotsprings is a popular tourist attraction located at kilometre 765 of the Alaska Highway. *The historic Liard River Suspension Bridge, built in 1944, is located at kilometre 798 of the Alaska Highway. Course =Yukon= The Liard River originates in south-eastern part of the Yukon, on the slopes of Mount Lewis, at , at an elevation of . It flows south and east, between the ranges of Pelly Mountains, then south through the Yukon Plateau, where it receives the waters of Prospect Creek. It turns east after it receives the waters of the Caribou Creek from Caribou Lakes, then the Swede and Junkers Creek. It then follows the southern rim of the St. Cyr Range of the Pelly Mountains, where the Ings River flows into it. It follows the southern edge of the Simpson Range, receiving the waters of the Old Gold Creek, Rainbow Creek, Dome Creek, Quartz Creek and Scurvy Creek. The Liard River continues south-east, north of the Cassiar Mountains, from where it receives the Sayyea Creek and Cabin Creek while the Eckman Creek,Black River and Hasselberg Creek flow in from the north. It continues in a south- east direction, receiving the Sambo Creek, False Pass Creek, Meister River, Frances River, Rancheria River, Tom Creek, Watson Creek and Albert Creek before it flows through Upper Liard, west of Watson Lake, where it is crossed by the Alaska Highway. It receives the waters of Cormier Creek, then flows through the Liard Canyon and into British Columbia. =British Columbia= Liard River Hot Springs It flows south-east and east along the Alaska Highway, receiving the waters of Dease River, Kloye Creek, Trepanier Creek and Black Angus Creek. It continues east through the Dease Forest, where it receives the waters of the Hyland River south of Hyland River Provincial Park, then receives the Malcolm Creek, Tatisno Creek and Nustlo Creek. It flows along the Yukon border, where the Alaska Highway once again follows the Liard and receives the Cosh Creek, Contact Creek, Scoby Creek and Sandin Brook, then turns south around Mount Sandin, receiving water from Tsia Creek, Tsinitla Creek, Tatzille Creek and Leguil Creek. It turns eastwards along the northern margin of the Liard Plateau, where it receives the Kechika River near Skooks Landing, Niloil Creek from Niloil Lake and Coal River by Coal River. It continues east and south-east, south of Mount Reid, still followed by the Alaska Highway, receiving the waters of Geddes Creek, Grant Creek, Smith River, Lapie Creek, Teeter Creek, Mould Creek and Hoole Creek. Liard River Suspension Bridge, built in 1944 on the Alaska Highway It enters the Liard River Hot Springs Provincial Park, where the Trout River empties into the Liard. Alaska Highway runs south along the Trout River, while the Liard flows east through the Liard River Corridor Provincial Park and Protected Area, south of the Sentinel Range of the Muskwa Ranges, receiving the waters of Deer River and Canyon Creek in the Grand Canyon of the Liard. It continues south- east between the Barricade Range and Mount Rothenberg of the Sentinel Range, where the Moule Creek and Sulphur Creek flow in the Liard. It flows east, out of the Northern Rockies and through the foothills, where it receives waters from the Brimstone Creek, Crusty Creek, Grayling River, Graybank Creek and Toad River. It turns north-west, receiving the waters from Garbutt Creek, Lepine Creek, Chimney Creek, Ruthie Creek, Scatter River and Beaver River. It then turns south-east, receives the waters from Catkin Creek, Dunedin River and Fort Nelson River. From here it turns north, receiving the waters of Zus Creek, Sandy Creek and La Biche River and crosses into the Northwest Territories, immediately east of the Yukon border. =Northwest Territories= Ferry across Liard River, way to Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories The Liard River continues north, receiving the waters of Big Island Creek, Kotaneelee River and Petitot River. It turns around Mount Coty of the Franklin Mountains near Fort Liard Airfield, where it meets the Liard Highway. It receives the waters of the Muskeg River, Rabbit Creek and Flett Creek as it flows east of the Liard Range and Mount Flett. The Liard meanders east of the Sawmill Mountain and receives waters from the Beaver Water Creek, Netla River and Bay Creek. After receiving the waters of South Nahanni River south of Nahanni Butte and east of the Nahanni National Park Reserve, the Liard turns east and north-east, receiving waters from Grainger River, Blackstone River, Dehdjida Creek, Matou River, Birch River and Poplar River. It then turns north, being followed by the Mackenzie Highway, and receives the Manners Creek before it empties into the Mackenzie River, immediately upstream of Fort Simpson, at Clay Point, at an elevation of .

Zombies of the Stratosphere  Another 12-chapter Rocket Man movie serial, Zombies of the Stratosphere, was written as the direct sequel to Radar Men from the Moon. But the name of the serial's main character was changed from Commando Cody to the more prosaic \\"Larry Martin\\" at the start of shooting. This lead character renaming happened after footage shot for the first three episodes of Republic's proposed science fiction syndicated television series, Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe, which was first released (for union contractual reasons) to theaters instead of TV. Republic, meanwhile, released both of these Rocket Man serials during 1953. Because of its original television production origins, the longer length of the weekly serial chapters, and their lack of traditional cliffhanger endings, many entrenched serial fans refuse to acknowledge the theatrical release of Sky Marshal as a true movie serialthis despite its having been released weekly to theaters and having a plot that progresses through a dozen numbered and titled chapters until the villain is finally defeated in the final chapter. Sky Marshal was finally syndicated to NBC television in 1955 as a dozen 24+ minute episodes (before commercials).  Confusion with other serials  Commando Cody serials are sometimes confused with King of the Rocket Men (1949), because the rocket- powered flying suit and helmet costume worn by the title character, Jeff King, was recycled to become the flying suit worn by Cody. To add to the confusion, serial hero \\"Larry Martin\\", who started out to be Commando Cody, wore the same costume again in Zombies of the Stratosphere. Referring to these different Republic characters wearing the same costume collectively as \\"The Rocket Man\\" was a concept formulated decades later on film by Walt Disney Productions in their 1991 feature film, The Rocketeer, based on a comic book series by Dave Stevens, which was in turn a nod to the various Republic \\"rocket-suited\\" serial characters. A similar character with a similar name was Commander Corry, hero of the ABC TV and radio series Space Patrol, which ran from 1950 to 1955. Corry's title was \\"Commander-in-Chief of the Space Patrol\\".

He is currently overseeing construction of The Bullitt Center, expected to be the greenest, most energy efficient commercial building in the world, firmly planting Seattle at the forefront of the green building movement. The goal of the Bullitt Center is to change the way buildings are designed, built and operated to improve long-term environmental performance and promote broader implementation of energy efficiency, renewable energy and other green building technologies in the Northwest. The building is seeking to meet the ambitious goals of the Living Building Challenge, the world‚Äôs most strenuous benchmark for sustainability. For example, a solar array will generate as much electricity as the building uses and rain will supply as much water, with all wastewater treated onsite.

The Persian daric was a gold coin which, along with a similar silver coin, the siglos, represented the bimetallic monetary standard of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.Michael Alram, \\"DARIC\\", Encyclopaedia Iranica, December 15, 1994, last updated November 17, 2011 Cyrus the Great (550‚Äì530 BC) introduced coins to the Persian Empire after 546 BC, following his conquest of Lydia and the defeat of its king Croesus, who had put in place the first coinage in history. It seems Cyrus initially adopted the Lydian coinage as such, and continued to strike Lydia's lion-and- bull coinage. Darius I (521‚Äì486 BC) introduced a new thick gold coin which had a standard weight of 8.4 grams, equaling in value 20 silver coins. The gold used in the coins was of very high quality with a purity of 95.83% and it bore the image of the Persian king or a great warrior armed with a bow and arrow. Their use ended with Alexander the Great's invasion in 330 BC, after which they were mostly melted down and recoined as coins of Alexander. Close to the end of the 5th century BC, the Persian satraps in Asia Minor decided to strike their own coins. Darius considered such encroachment a crime punishable by death since the right of coinage was treated as an exclusively royal prerogative. The numismatic evidence does not permit identification of the image on the darics and sigloi as anything but that of the king; it was adopted by Darius as a dynamic expression of his royal power expressly for his coin issues. An Achaemenid daric, 4th century BC. The coin is mentioned twice in the Hebrew Bible, where it is called the \\"adarkonim\\", as the Israelites came into contact with it when their Babylonian conquerors were conquered by Persia. The first Book of Chronicles describes King David as asking an assembly of people to donate for the construction of the Temple. The people gave generously \\"for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.\\" (New Revised Standard Version), emphasis added. Since David's reign is believed to be between c. 1048 and c. 1007 BC according to Old Testament chronology, the use of the daric is either an anachronism or a conversion by the writer into contemporary units. The other instance is Ezra 8:27; also a derivative Greek term \\"darkemonium\\" is recorded in Ezra 2:69 and three times in Nehemiah 7:70-72. After bribes distributed by a Persian satrap to start the Corinthian War in Greece led to Spartan king Agesilaus II being recalled from a successful campaign in Asia Minor, he remarked that he had been driven out of Asia by \\"ten thousand archers\\" (referring to the image stamped on the daric).Plutarch Life of Agesilaus 16.6 The ancient Greeks believed that the term dareik√≥s () was derived from the name of Darius the Great, who was believed to have introduced these coins. Some scholars agree with this and constructed the Old Persian word as *dƒÅrayaka-,Shapur Shahbazi. \\"DARIUS iii. Darius I the Great\\", Encyclopaedia Iranica. December 15, 1994. Last updated May 9, 2012. while others have generally supposed that the Greek term can be traced back to Old Persian *dari- (\\"golden\\", which possibly evolved into the word ÿ≤ÿ± [zar] in modern Persian) and that it was first associated with the name of Darius only in later folk etymology.

It is the principal rival of Coca- Cola and Pepsi in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The company is one of the leading soft drinks producers and distributors in Central and Eastern Europe.  History  A glass and a bottle of Kofola Kofola originated in the Czechoslovak Research Institute of Medicinal Plants in Prague in 1959, during research targeted at finding a possible use for surplus caffeine produced in the process of coffee roasting. The resulting dark-coloured, sweet-and-sour syrup Kofo became the main ingredient of a new soft drink named Kofola introduced in 1960. During the 1960s and 1970s Kofola became exceedingly popular in communist Czechoslovakia because it substituted for Western cola drinks like Coca-Cola or Pepsi, which were generally available since 1968 (Pepsi in 1974), but were expensive and considered as for high society. Even today, Kofola is a popular option in restaurants as it can be draught from kegs right into a glass. Since 1998 Kofola has been bottled (in addition to classical 0.33-litre glass bottles) in 0.5-litre and 2-litre plastic bottles. 0.25-litre cans were introduced in 2003, 1-litre plastic-bottles in December 2004. Kofola draught from 50-litre kegs, traditionally sold in many bars and restaurants across the two countries, is very popular as well. Since 2002 the producer has launched a successful media campaign aimed at a young and hip audience based on the slogan \\"Kdy≈æ ji miluje≈°, nen√≠ co ≈ôe≈°it / Keƒè ju miluje≈°, nie je ƒço rie≈°i≈•\\" (\\"If you love it, there is nothing to question\\"). Until 2000, the Kofola logo featured a coffee bean. It now resembles a coffee flower.  Company  After the fall of the Communist regime in 1989, Kofola had to compete with many foreign brands that entered the attractive newly opened market. After a period of decline and trademark lawsuits (many companies produced their own similarly tasting \\"kofola\\" because the term became a genericized trademark), in 2000 the Santa n√°poje company, owned by the Greek-immigrant Samaras family, became the only producer and distributor of Kofola in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Other producers of similar drinks had to rename their products (most notable Slovakian Hejkola and ≈†ofocola). The company Santa n√°poje originally produced Kofola drink only in the parent factory in Krnov. In 2002, the company built a new factory in Rajeck√° Lesn√°, Slovakia, to satisfy the demand of the Slovak market. In 2003, Santa n√°poje changed its name to Kofola, a.s. and later to Kofola ƒåeskoSlovensko a.s.The Kofola Group Apart from Kofola it also produces other soft drinks, the spring water Rajec, the fresh fruit juices UGO, the syrups Jup√≠ and children's drink Jup√≠k, RC Cola under license and from 2008 the grape drink Vinea, that are exported to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia. In 2008 Kofola announced a merger with the Polish lemonade producer Hoop. In autumn 2008, the Polish Private Equity fund Enterprise Investors acquired in a Public Tender Offer 42.46% of Kofola-Hoop for approximately ‚Ç¨140 million. In 2009, the Polish company Kofola-Hoop S.A. was renamed into Kofola S.A. In April 2009, Kofola acquired Pinelli and since then has produced the energy drink Semtex. In 2010, Kofola opened a new factory in Mnichovo Hradi≈°tƒõ. In December 2014, Kofola bought Slovenian factory for mineral water Radenska.  Ingredients  Kofo syrup, the main ingredient of Kofola, consists of 14 herbal and fruit ingredients (such as extracts from apple, cherry, currant, or herbal aroma), sugar and/or high fructose corn syrup (2014), and caramel. In comparison with Pepsi or Coca-Cola it contains 30% less sugar, ~56% more caffeine (15 mg/100ml, Coca-Cola 9.6 mg/100ml) and it does not contain phosphoric acid.

It began to store water in 1944 due to the impounding of the Sacramento River by Shasta Dam, the ninth tallest dam in the United States. Shasta Lake is a key facility of the Central Valley Project and provides flood control for the Sacramento Valley downstream of the dam. Water outflow generates power through the Shasta Powerplant and is subsequently used for irrigation and municipal purposes. The reservoir lies within the Whiskeytown‚ÄìShasta‚ÄìTrinity National Recreation Area, operated by the Shasta- Trinity National Forest.

Geography With a capacity of at full pool, the lake has an elevation of , and a surface area of , making it the state's largest reservoir, and its third-largest body of water after Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea. Ten miles (16 km) north of the city of Redding, with the town of Lakehead on its northern shore, Shasta Lake is popular for boating, water skiing, camping, house boating and fishing. Formed by the damming of the Sacramento River, the lake has of mostly steep mountainous shoreline covered with tall evergreen trees and manzanita. The maximum depth is . The lake has four major arms, each created by an approaching river: the Sacramento River, the McCloud River, Squaw Creek, and the Pit River. The Sacramento River's source is the Klamath Mountains. The McCloud River's source is Mount Shasta. The Pit River flows from Alturas, and the waterfall Potem Falls is located on that arm of the lake. History Shasta Dam was constructed between 1935 and 1945 across the Sacramento River, and Shasta Lake was formed in 1948. The Pit River, McCloud River, and several smaller tributaries had their lower courses and confluences with the Sacramento River submerged by the reservoir. Also beneath the lake is the submerged town of Kennett and many village sites of the Wintun people together with their traditional fishing, hunting, and gathering locations. Parts of the defunct tunnels and right of way of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company can be seen when the water level is low. Shasta Lake hosted the first \\"Boardstock\\" event in 1996, which continued there annually through 1999, after which the annual event moved to Clear Lake, California, 170 miles southwest of Shasta Lake. Boardstock drew many pro wakeboard riders from around the world, with an average attendance of 15,000 people. The event lasted for 3 days each year with several wakeboard contests being performed. Marinas There are a number of marinas on Shasta Lake offering a variety of services, including houseboat rentals. * Bridge Bay Marina is the largest marina on Shasta lake with over 700 slips. It has a restaurant, bar, and lodging, as well as retail and other facilities. Visitors to Bridge Bay may rent one of 100 houseboats, as well as ski boats, fishing boats, patio boats, and personal water craft such as stand up paddle boards, jet skis, and Jetovators. Bridge Bay boasts a busy public dock during the summer season, with a gas dock, food, ice and retail amenities. * Digger Bay Marina has over 150 boat slips in the marina, as well as a retail store and small boat rental. Digger Bay is located almost 10 miles from Highway 5. * Shasta Marina Resort is located at the center of the Sacramento Arm of Shasta Lake in the O'Brien Inlet of Lakehead, CA. * Packer's Bay Marina is located at the center of the lake, just north of Bridge Bay Marina. * Antler's Marina is Shasta's northernmost marina. * Silverthorn Marina is located on the east part of the lake and offers large houseboats for rent. * Jones Valley Resort is the easternmost marina on the lake. Jones Valley is tucked far into a cove and features six different model rental houseboats, including the largest on the lake, the Titan. * Holiday Harbor is located up the McCloud River Arm, east of I-5. * Sugarloaf Marina is located up the Sacramento River Arm and offers a marina store, overnight slips, and fuel. Climate Shasta Lake has a temperate climate.

The archipelago includes over 7000 islands, and a total land area of 300,780 km¬≤. The Philippines was never connected to mainland Asia via land bridges, so the flora and fauna of the islands had to cross ocean straits to reach the Philippines. The Philippines is part of the Indomalayan realm, and its flora and fauna is mostly derived from tropical Asia. Botanically, the Philippines are part of Malesia, a floristic province that includes the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, and New Guinea. Most of the Malesian flora is derived from tropical Asia, including the dipterocarps, which are the characteristic tree of the Philippine forests. Elements of the Antarctic flora, which originated in the ancient southern hemisphere supercontinent of Gondwana, are also present, including ancient conifers like podocarps (Podocarpus, Nageia, Sundacarpus) and araucarias (Agathis). The ecoregions of the Philippines are defined primarily by the sea levels during the Ice Ages, which were 120 meters lower than at present, as billions of gallons of water were locked away in huge continental ice sheets. This drop in sea level connected many presently separate islands into larger islands, which allowed for exchanges of flora and fauna: * Greater Luzon included Luzon, Catanduanes, Marinduque, Polillo, and several small islands. * Greater Mindanao included Mindanao, Basilan, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and adjacent small islands. * Greater Palawan included Palawan, Balabac, Busuanga, Culion, Cuyo, and adjacent small islands. * Greater Negros‚ÄìPanay included Negros, Panay, Cebu, and Masbate. * Greater Sulu included the most of the Sulu Archipelago, from Tawi Tawi to Jolo. These formerly-linked islands each constitute a separate ecoregion, as does Mindoro, which remained separate from the rest, along with a few smaller islands, notably Camiguin, Sibuyan, and Siquijor. Each group of islands that were linked by land bridges in the ice ages also constitutes a separate faunal region. The lack of a land bridge to the Asian continent prevented most of the Asian megafauna, including elephants, rhinoceros, tapirs, tigers, leopards, and gibbons, from reaching the Philippines, although they do inhabit the adjacent Indonesian islands of Sundaland, which were formerly linked to the Asian continent by lowered sea levels. The other main factor that defines the Philippine ecoregions is elevation; the high mountains of Luzon and Mindanao host distinct montane rain forest ecoregions. The mountains of Luzon are also home to the Luzon tropical pine forests. Terrestrial ecoregions by major habitat typeWikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002).

The novel, Lin's first, covers the turbulent events in China from 1900 to 1938, including the Boxer Uprising, the Republican Revolution of 1911, the Warlord Era, the rise of nationalism and communism, and the start of the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945. Background At the repeated invitation of Pearl S. Buck, who had sponsored the publication of Lin's bestselling My Country and My People in 1935, Lin left China for New York in August, 1936 to write The Importance of Living, which was published in August 1937 to even greater success just as war broke out in China. In 1938, Lin left New York to spend a year in Paris, where he wrote Moment in Peking.Suoqiao Qian, Liberal Cosmopolitan: Lin Yutang and Middling Chinese Modernity (Leiden: Brill, 2011). . p. 246-247 Lin wrote the book in English for a U.S. audience, yet he based it in Chinese literature and philosophy. As an exercise, before he started to compose Moment in Peking, Lin translated passages from the classic Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber, and followed its example in showing a spectrum of characters in their social settings and defining them through their clothing, jewelry, and footwear, and even by their language (dialect), geography (region), and foodways.George Gao, \\"Lin Yutang's Appreciation of the Red Chamber Dream,\\" Renditions 2.Spring (1974). Lin's eldest daughter Lin Rusi also indicates in an introductory essay to a Chinese translation of Moment in Peking that the entire book was influenced by Zhuang Zi and its message was \\"Life is but a dream.\\"Airen Huang, \\"Hu Shi and Lin Yutang,\\" Chinese Studies in History 37.4 (Summer2004): 37-69. Lin tries not to be overly judgemental of the characters because he recognizes that too many issues were involved in the chaotic years of early twentieth century China. There are no absolutely right or wrong characters. Each character held a piece of truth and reality and a piece of irrationality. In the preface, Lin writes that \\"[This novel] is merely a story of... how certain habits of living and ways of thinking are formed and how, above all, [men and women] adjust themselves to the circumstances in this earthly life where men strive but gods rule.\\" While Lin does not display hatred toward the Japanese, he does let events and situations affect the novel's characters to let the reader clearly see the reason the Chinese are still bitter about Japan's military past. The novel ends with a cliffhanger, letting readers hope that the major characters who fled from the coastal regions to the inland of China would survive the horrible war. In the final pages of the book Lin observes: \\"What an epic story was being lived through by these people of China.... And it seemed to them that their own story was but a moment in old, ageless Peking, a story written by the finger of Time itself.... In this moving mass of refugees, there was now neither rich nor poor.\\"Moment in Peking, pp. 813-15. The sequel, A Leaf in the Storm, published in 1941, does not follow the same characters, but takes up in 1937, at roughly the point in time when Moment in Peking leaves off. Main characters Many characters are from three wealthy families: Yao, Tseng (Zeng), and New (Niu), but characters from other families play an integral part in the story, such as Lifu, from the Kong family. * Yao Mulan (ÂßöÊú®Ëò≠) The protagonist of the story, Mulan, is from the wealthy Yao family. During the Boxer Uprising many people left Peking and fled to other regions to avoid the turmoil and chaos of war. On the way to Hangchow she is separated from her family and then seized and sold to a human trafficking group, Fortunately the Tseng family track her down and buy (rescue) her. The two families become close friends and possible future in-laws. Mulan is lively, beautiful, intelligent and generous, as well as responsible. Her father has always encouraged her interests, among them her interest in \\"oracle bones,\\" which reveal ancient Chinese characters, and the singing of Chinese opera. Kung Lifu and his mother, Mrs.Kung are family friends of the Yaos. Both Mulan and Mochow have found Lifu to be deep, erudite,and virtuous: a promising future scholar and an interesting figure. Mulan is attracted to Lifu, but marriage and a romantic relationship had not crossed his mind. On the other hand, her reunion with her family seems so mysterious a circumstance, that on some level she feels that marriage with Sunya is fated. So with blessings from both families, she marries Sunya. Their marriage is mostly peaceful and harmonious. Together they have three children: Aman, Atung and Amei. * Tseng Sunya (Zeng Sunya, ÊõæËìÄ‰∫û) Mulan's husband, Tseng Sunya, is affectionately called \\"Fatty\\" by Mulan. As the youngest son of his family, Sunya is arguably the least responsible one, but has what is called a \\"round character\\". He and Mulan had gotten to know each other well when they were children after Mulan was rescued from bandits by his parents. As the two families became increasingly close, their engagement was planned happily. * Kung Lifu (Kong Lifu, Â≠îÁ´ãÂ§´) A scholar and Yao Mochow's husband, he marries Mochow but he admires Mulan. He was a biology professor at a school in Peking and also fight for democracy and law in China. He is a member of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party. * Yao Mochow (Yao Mochou, ÂßöËé´ÊÑÅ) Yao Mulan's sister, she is also very clever and attractive. She married Lifu, when he was a poor scholar, and unlike many marriages in the olden times, she had an eye for Lifu long before their engagement. Mochow is stable, reliable and extremely responsible. She takes care of her sick mother for years, remaining by her side. She knows her sister's love for Lifu, but she is confident in their sisterly love. * Yao Sze-an (Yao Si'an) (ÂßöÊÄùÂÆâ) He was a playboy when he was young. However, he has become a great Taoist monk later. He influenced Lifu very much. Sze-an was also interested in \\"oracle bones\\" * Mrs. Yao (ÂßöÂ§™Â§™) A traditional Chinese woman. She loves her oldest son, Tijen, best. She opposes Tijen and Yinpin's love, and causes her death. She becomes depressed, unable to talk, and very weak for the rest of her life. * Shanhu(ÁèäÁëö) Shanhu is the oldest child of the Yao family. Though her family name is Xie, not Yao, she has always considered the Yaos as her real family. Her father, Mr.Xie, is a close friend of Yao Si-an's. Yao Si-an and his wife took her in and raised her along. They treated her as if she was one of their own. She is second in command when it came to daily routines in the house and has been a great help to Mrs. Yao. She was 19 years old when she married a fine young man, who died a year later and left her childless and alone. So she returned home. * Cassia (Auntie Gui, Ê°ÇÂß®) The concubine or maid in the Tseng household. She has two daughters Ailien and Lilien, who become modern ladies and married doctors. * Tseng Wenpo (ÊõæÊñá‰ºØ) A typical old Northeastern officer, honest and kind, but hates everything about foreign countries. * Mrs. Tseng (ÊõæÂ§™Â§™) The strong-willed leader of the Tseng family. She holds the family together, and she likes Mulan and Mannia, but Suyun's behavior annoys her. * New Suyun (Niu Suyun, ÁâõÁ¥†Èõ≤) Her parents thought Chinya was a man who had the right character to be a successful officer, so Suyun marries him. During their marriage, she bosses and orders him around like a busboy. Suyun later becomes a friend of Inging, her second brother's concubine. She divorces Chinya, and becomes an officer's concubine and also the infamous Japanese-controlled heroin dealer known as the \\"White Powder Queen.\\" When she finally recognizes her mistake she is killed by the Japanese army. * Sun Mannia (Â≠´ÊõºÂ®ò) Married to the Tseng's eldest son, Pingya. She becomes a widow the week after her wedding. She adopts a child, Asuan, and remains in the Tseng family. She commits suicide during the Japanese war, and remains a virgin till her death. * New Huaiyu (ÁâõÊá∑Áëú) The second son of the New family. He leaves his wife and four children, and marries a singsong girl (also a prostitute) named Niu Inging (ÁâõÈ∂ØÈ∂Ø). He betrays his country, and is nearly killed by his eldest son. * Tseng Chinya (Zeng Jinya, ÊõæÁ∂ì‰∫û) The second son of the Tseng family, a weak character who asks just to have a peaceful life. He was kind to everybody. He falls in love with Anxiang. * Tseng Pingya (ÊõæÂπ≥‰∫û) The eldest son of the Tseng family. He loves Manni but dies the week after his wedding. * Anxiang (ÊöóÈ¶ô) Kidnapped when she was a child, and meets Mulan. When Mulan is saved by Mr. Tseng, Dim Fragrance is sold to another family. She becomes a nursery maid of Mulan's child some years later. She finally found her family, and becomes Jinya's second wife. * Tsao Lihua (Cao Lihua, ÊõπÈ∫óËèØ) A young art student. She meets Sunya in Hangzhou, and falls in love with him. Sunya lies to her that his wife was an old and fat country woman. When she met Mulan, she is surprised, and eventually became her friend. *Yao Tijen (Yao Tiren, ÂßöÈ´î‰ªÅ) Mulan's older brother, a selfish dandy. His father sent him to England to study, but he spent all of the money in Hong Kong. He falls in love with his servant girl Yinpin, and has a son with her. Their love is opposed by his mother. After Yinpin's suicide, he works hard in his uncle's drug store and dies in an accident. * Afei (ÈòøÈùûÔºåÂßöÈùû) Mulan's younger brother. * Tung Paofen (Dong Baofen, Ëë£ÂØ∂Ëä¨Ôºâ A Manchu princess. Her family once owned the gardens which became the Yao's later. Her family believed that there were great treasures buried in the garden, and sent her to Yao family to work as a servant girl and to find the treasure. She marries Afei after Hongyu's death. * Hongyu (Á¥ÖÁéâ) Mulan, Mochow, and Afei's cousin. She is madly in love with Afei, and admires the famous character Lin Daiyu from the classic novel Dream of the Red Chamber (Á¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢). When she misunderstands a conversation and thinks that Afei doesn't love her, she drowns herself, or so it seems. She dies in vain, leaving her parents devastated. Her death provides a reflection on the Yaos: ill-mannered, irresponsible, negligent. The so-called blood-ties are so weak when it comes to real commitment. Chinese translations Lin originally wanted the poet Yu Dafu to do the Chinese translation, but Yu had only completed the first section when he was killed by the Japanese in World War II. Lin did not particularly like the first complete Chinese translation, which was done by 1941. In 1977 Zhang Zhenyu, a translator from Taiwan, created what is the most popular translation today, titled Jinghua Yanyun (). It was not available in mainland China until a publisher in Jilin issued a sanitized version in 1987. The current political climate permits Shaanxi Normal University Press to publish the full translation. Yu Dafu's son Yu Fei (ÈÉÅÈ£õ) finished his own translation in 1991, but his version, titled Shunxi Jinghua (), is not widely read. Adaptations The novel has been adapted three times into a television drama, including a 1988 adaptation starring Angie Chiu, a 2005 adaptation starring Zhao Wei, and a 2014 adaptation starring Li Sheng.

Traditionally a tourist destination, the area is marketed to tourists for its rugged peninsulas (such as the remote Beara Peninsula, Sheep's Head and Mizen Head peninsulas), beaches such as Inchydoney, Owenahincha and Barleycove, and towns and villages such as Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Kinsale and Rosscarbery. The area of West Cork is not strictly defined, but at its broadest definition it includes all parts of County Cork south and west of the River Lee with the exception of Cork city and suburbs. Road signs may be found around Cork city and elsewhere directing traffic for \\"The West\\", or \\"West Cork\\".  Transport  Baltimore Harbour The area was linked in the early 19th century by the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway, which began in Cork City, travelled across the county, with branches to Clonakilty (junction at Gaggin) and Skibbereen (junction at Drimoleague), before terminating at Bantry. The narrow gauge Schull and Skibbereen Railway closed in 1947. Today, the main infrastructural backbone is provided by the N71 and R586 routes. Other towns in West Cork include Bantry, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Ballydehob, Castletownbere, Schull, Rosscarbery and Macroom (perhaps the most northern area described as West Cork).  Older districts  West Cork has had a distinct identity from at least the ancient D√°irine kingdom of Corcu Lo√≠gde which once covered the whole area. The localities of Carbery, the largest barony in Ireland down to the nineteenth-century, Bantry, and Bear, or Bere, on Beara Peninsula, existed down from the Middle Ages. The coastal islands are now known as Carbery's Hundred Isles. The coastal area from Ballydehob to Timoleague was contained within the Dioceses of Ross, both Catholic and Church of Ireland. These dioceses no longer exist separately and now form part of the larger Dioceses Cork and Ross (and Cloyne in the case of Church of Ireland). Beara is a deanery within the Diocese of Kerry.

The species is commonly known as the thick-tailed or barking gecko, referring to its distinctive plump tail and sharp, barking defensive call. The genus is also often called thick-tailed geckos as a group, along with the species Uvidicolus sphyrurus. Etymology The specific name, milii, is in honor of French sailor and naturalist Pierre Bernard Milius.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Underwoodisaurus milii, p. 178). Description U. milii is reddish-brown with bands of white and yellow spots, and a paler underbelly. It usually grows to a total length (including tail) of . The original tail is black with several pale bands, however the regenerated tail has little pattern. Habitat U. milii is found in rocky outcrops across southern Australia, and is slightly more cold- tolerant than many other Australian gecko species. It is nocturnal, and shelters underneath rocks or in burrows during the day. Diet U. milii feeds on insects and small vertebrates. Aggregation Unusually for reptiles, U. milii forms aggregations in its retreat sites during the day. The reasons for this are unknown. However, it has been shown that this behavior results in a higher aggregate thermal inertia (they stay warmer) than would be found in solitary geckos of this and related kinds in similar circumstances.Lancaster J, Wilson P, Espinoza RE (2006). \\"Physiological benefits as precursors of sociality: Why banded geckos band\\". Animal Behavior 72: 199-207. In the same source, it was suggested that aggregating for physiological benefits may precede the development of other kinds of social behavior. Behaviour When threatened, U. milii will arch its back and \\"bark\\". It also does this in breeding season. This species, and some other species of geckos have the unusual habit of licking their eyes after eating, presumably to keep the eyeshield clean. Geographic range U. milii is found in southern regions of Australia. Its distribution in Western Australia is throughout the southwest, the goldfields, wheatbelt, and nullarbor regions to the east, and to Shark Bay in the north. It is also found at the Houtman Abrolhos and the Archipelago of the Recherche. Conservation status The species U. milii has been assessed by the IUCN Red List and is listed as Least Concern. It has not been assessed by the Australian EPBC Act, and may be kept as a pet with the appropriate license in at least some states of Australia.

He held senior ministerial positions in the governments of John Bracken, Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell, and served as the province's 14th Lieutenant Governor between 1953 and 1960. McDiarmid was born in Perthshire, Scotland, and emigrated to Canada with his family in 1887. He was educated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and hired by the Winnipeg Paint and Glass Co. upon its formation in 1902. He later worked his way up to president of the McDiarmid Brothers Lumber Company, which was also located in the city. In 1925, he was elected as an alderman on Winnipeg's municipal council. He represented the city's first ward, located in south Winnipeg. The following year, McDiarmid was elected to the federal House of Commons as a Liberal, in the riding of Winnipeg South. He defeated his only opponent, Conservative Robert Rogers, by 8809 votes to 7638. For the next four years, he served in parliament as a backbench supporter of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. He was defeated by Rogers in a 1930 rematch, 10117 votes to 9774. On May 27, 1932, McDiarmid was appointed Provincial Lands Commissioner and Minister of Mines and Natural Resources in the government of provincial Premier John Bracken. This occurred after negotiations in which the provincial Liberal party merged with Bracken's governing Progressives; McDiarmid received one of the cabinet positions designated for the Liberal Party. In a provincial election held less than one month later, McDiarmid was elected to the provincial assembly, topping his party's list in Winnipeg (which elected ten members by preferential balloting, at the time). Outgoing provincial Liberal leader Murdoch Mackay was defeated in the 1932 election, and McDiarmid was subsequently recognized as the leading Liberal spokesman in the Liberal- Progressive coalition. He was not formally recognized as a party leader, as the Liberals were no longer an autonomous entity. Ideologically, McDiarmid appears to have been on the right-wing of his party. One-time Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leader Lloyd Stinson described him as the most right- wing member of the Liberal-Progressive government, and also accused him of being anti-labour. McDiarmid was re-elected for Winnipeg in 1936, finishing fifth on the city's first-preference votes. In the election 1941, held after the creation of a grand coalition ministry with the Conservatives, CCF and Social Credit, he topped the city's poll outright. McDiarmid retained the Land and Natural Resources/Mines portfolios for the entirety of his time in cabinet, and was also Provincial Secretary from November 28, 1939 to February 14, 1946, Railway Commissioner and Minister of Industry and Commerce from November 4, 1940 to June 30, 1953, and (briefly) acting Labour Minister following the resignation of CCF leader Seymour Farmer in 1942. McDiarmid finished second on the Winnipeg poll in the general election of 1945 (Farmer was first). In 1949, he topped the poll in the redistributed four-member riding of Winnipeg South. McDiarmid announced his retirement from politics in 1953, and formally resigned from cabinet on June 30 of that year. Following a period of intense media speculation, McDiarmid was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba on August 1 of the same year. He served in this largely ceremonial position until January 15, 1960, when he was replaced by former Progressive Conservative party leader Errick Willis. During his time in cabinet, McDiarmid was responsible for legislation opening northern Manitoba's mine fields to development. He died in 1965.

Bush signs into law S.2590, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Looking on are Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), Chairwoman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and from left: Rep. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL), Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE), Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA). The domestic policy of the George W. Bush Administration was the domestic policy of the United States from 2001 to 2009 while George W. Bush was president. Bush's main domestic policy advisors include Chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs Edward Lazear, Rob Portman, director of the Office of Management and Budget; U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao Vice President Dick Cheney; U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson; U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael O. Leavitt and Allan Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council. Some of George W. Bush's biggest domestic policy achievements include winning passage for two major tax cuts during his term in office: the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the \\"Bush tax cuts\\". Law enforcement and justice =Surveillance and homeland security= On October 26, 2001, Bush signed into law the Patriot Act. Passed on the president's request, the act permitted increased sharing of intelligence among the U.S. Intelligence Community and expanded the government's domestic authority to conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists. The Patriot Act also authorized the use of roving wiretaps on suspected terrorists and expanded the government's authority to conduct surveillance of suspected \\"lone wolf\\" terrorists. Bush also secretly authorized the National Security Agency to conduct warrantless surveillance of communications in and out of the United States.Mann (2015), pp. 63‚Äì65 Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Bush announced the creation of the Office of Homeland Security and appointed former governor of Pennsylvania Tom Ridge its director.Draper (2007), p. 157 After Congress passed the Homeland Security Act signed into law by President Bush on November 25, 2002 to create the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Ridge became the first director of the newly-created department. The department was charged with overseeing immigration, border control, customs, and the newly- established Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which focused on airport security. Though the FBI and CIA remained independent agencies, the DHS was assigned jurisdiction over the Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (which was divided into three agencies), the United States Customs Service (which was also divided into separate agencies), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Homeland Security Act represented the most significant departmental reorganization since the National Security Act of 1947. =Capital punishment= George W. Bush is a strong supporter of capital punishment. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were executed in that state, maintaining its record as the leading state in executions. As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Although Bush's support of the death penalty is known, controversy broke in 1999 when journalist Tucker Carlson revealed that the Governor had mocked the plight of Karla Faye Tucker in an interview. =Amber Alert= Bush signed the Amber Alert legislation into law on April 30, 2003, which was developed to quickly alert the general public about child abductions using various media sources. On July 27, 2006 Bush signed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act which establishes a national database requiring all convicted sex offenders to register their current residency and related details on a monthly instead of the previous yearly basis. Newly convicted sex offenders will also face longer mandatory incarceration periods. =Prison rape= The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA) is the first United States federal law passed dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law by President Bush on September 4, 2003. As a result, the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission was created to study the problem and recommend solutions. Federal funding for prisons also began to require detainment facilities to keep records on sexual assault. Failure to follow PREA requirements resulted in losing up to 5% of funding. New grants to prevent sexual assault were also created by the law. Significant support for the act came from Human Rights Watch, Concerned Women for America, Just Detention International, and numerous evangelical organizations.  Science  On December 19, 2002, Bush signed into law H. R. 4664, far-reaching legislation to put the National Science Foundation (NSF) on a track to double its budget over five years and to create new mathematics and science education initiatives at both the pre-college and undergraduate level. In the first three years of those five, the R&D; budget has increased by fourteen percent. Bush has long been dogged by criticism that his administration ignores or suppresses scientific advice. Bush showed support for oceanography and space exploration; and supported sciences on reducing pollution. Bush generally was opposed to biology especially the science of human reproduction and reproductive health; and science with global warming. Bush supported \\"Teach the Controversy\\". Bush's positions were not always shared by his party. = Stem cell research = President Bush supported adult stem cell research and umbilical cord blood stem cell research. However, Bush opposed any new embryonic stem cell research, and had limited the federal funding of existing research. Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research was first approved under President Clinton on January 19, 1999, but no money was to be spent until the guidelines were published. The guidelines were released under Clinton on August 23, 2000. They allowed use of unused frozen embryos. On August 9, 2001, before any funding was granted under these guidelines, Bush announced modifications to the guidelines to allow use of only existing stem cell lines. While Bush claimed that more than 60 embryonic stem cell lines already existed from privately funded research, scientists in 2003 said there were only 11 usable lines, and in 2005 that all lines approved for Federal funding are contaminated and unusable. Adult stem cell funding was not restricted and was supported by President Bush as a more viable means of research. = Space exploration = President George W. Bush waves as he prepares to depart the White House aboard Marine One from the South Lawn en route to Andrews Air Force Base for his trip to Michigan. On January 14, 2004, Bush announced a Vision for Space Exploration,\\"President Bush Delivers Remarks On U.S. Space Policy\\" January 14, 2004. Release from NASA Facts. calling for the completion of the International Space Station by 2010 and the retirement of the space shuttle while developing a new spacecraft called the Crew Exploration Vehicle under the title Project Constellation. The CEV would be used to return American astronauts to the Moon by 2018, with the objective of establishing a permanent lunar base, and eventually sending future manned missions to Mars. To this end, the plan proposes that NASA's budget increase by five percent every year until it is capped at US$18 billion in 2008, with only inflationary increases thereafter.\\"Strategy Based on Long-Term Affordability\\" ‚Äì A January 14, 2006 graph showing a plan for NASA's long-term budget. The planned retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2010 after the ISS is completed is also expected to free up US$5 billion to US$6 billion a year. The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign.http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/8572141.htm?1c Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections. Supporters believe that this plan will be an important part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding over the next five years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term. In January 2005, the White House released a new Space Transportation Policy fact sheet which outlined the administration's space policy in broad terms and tied the development of space transport capabilities to national security requirements. = Environment = In December 2003, Bush signed legislation implementing key provisions of his Healthy Forests Initiative. Another subject of controversy is Bush's Clear Skies Initiative, which seeks to reduce air pollution through expansion of emissions trading. Bush signed the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 authorizing the federal government to begin cleaning up pollution and contaminated sediment in the Great Lakes, as well as the Brownfields Legislation in 2002, accelerating the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites, or brownfields, to better protect public health, create jobs, and revitalize communities. Bush stated his reason for not supporting the Kyoto Protocol was that it unfairly targeted the United States while being deliberately lenient with certain developing countries, especially China and India. Bush stated, \\"The world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases is China. Yet, China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.\\" Bush also questioned the science behind the global warming phenomenon, insisting that more research be done to determine its validity. Hurricane Katrina President Bush shaking hands with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin after viewing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, September 2, 2005 Hurricane Katrina struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans. Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27 and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day.; He authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort. President Bush with hurricane victims in Biloxi, September 2, 2005 On August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it \\"an incident of national significance\\", triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans. The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was \\"not enough\\". As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.\\"I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.\\" George W. Bush to Diane Sawyer, Good Morning America, September 1, 2005. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.  Global warming  Upon arriving in office in 2001, President Bush withdrew United States support of the then-pending Kyoto Protocol, a UN Convention seeking to impose mandatory targets for reducing \\"greenhouse gas\\" emissions. Bush stated that human activity had not been proven to be the cause and cited concerns about the treaty's impact on the U.S. economy and pointed out that China and India had not signed on. The Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005. As of September 2011, 191 states have signed and ratified the protocol. The only remaining signatory not to have ratified the protocol is the United States. In 2002, the Bush Administration's EPA issued a Climate Action Report concluding that the climate changes observed over several decades \\"are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability\\". While the EPA report was initially hailed by some environmentalists critical of the Bush administration as a \\"180-degree turn on the science\\" reversing \\"everything the president has said about global warming since he took office,\\" within days President Bush dismissed the report as being \\"put out by the bureaucracy,\\" and reaffirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush Administration's stance on global warming, and in particular its questioning the consensus of scientists, would remain controversial in the scientific and environmental communities during his presidency. In 2004, the Director of NASA's Goddard Institute, James E. Hansen, came out publicly and harshly accusing the Administration of misinforming the public by suppressing the scientific evidence of the dangers of greenhouse gases, saying the Bush Administration wanted to hear only scientific results that \\"fit predetermined, inflexible positions\\" and edited reports to make the dangers sound less threatening in what he asserted was \\"direct opposition to the most fundamental precepts of science.\\" Other experts, such as former U.S. Department of Energy official Joseph Romm, have decried the Bush administration as a \\"denier and delayer\\" of government action essential to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.Joseph Romm's 2006 book Hell and High Water. (Publisher description here) Romm calls Bush's \\"don't rush to judgment\\" and \\"we need to ask more questions\\" stance a classic delay tactic. Part 2. In 2005, Council on Environmental Quality chairman and former oil industry lobbyist Philip Cooney, was accused of doctoring and watering down descriptions of climate research from other government agencies. The White House denied these reports. Two days later, Cooney announced his resignation and conceded his role in altering the reports. \\"My sole loyalty was to the President and advancing the policies of his administration,\\" he told the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In addition, the administration thanked Exxon executives for the company's \\"active involvement\\" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the US stance on Kyoto. President Bush believes that global warming is real and has said that he has consistently noted that global warming is a serious problem but asserted there is a \\"debate over whether it's manmade or naturally caused\\" and maintained that regardless of that debate his administration was working on plans to make America less dependent on foreign oil \\"for economic and national security reasons.\\" The United States has signed the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, a pact that allows signatory countries to set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions individually, but with no enforcement mechanism. Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with 187 mayors from US towns and cities, have pledged to adopt Kyoto style legal limits on greenhouse gas emissions. President George W. Bush gestures as he addresses his remarks to the media in Camp David, following a meeting with his economic advisors, from left to right, Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors; Rob Portman, director of the Office of Management and Budget; U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao; Vice President Dick Cheney; U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson; U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael O. Leavitt and Allan Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council.  Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  For economic and national security reasons, Bush supported Alaska Senator Ted Stevens' plan to tap the oil reserves in a area of Alaska's 19 million acre (77,000 km¬≤) Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Pro-exploration supporters argue that U.S. companies have the most stringent environmental requirements, and that by doing the drilling in the middle of the winter, it would create a very small environmental footprint. Opponents stated that drilling would damage the coastal plain's fragile ecosystem and its wildlife. Proponents stated that modern techniques can extract the oil without damaging the environment  The Clear Skies Act of 2003  Initially announced by President Bush in 2002, the Clear Skies Initiative was aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to further reduce air pollution and expanded the emissions trading programs to include new pollutants such as mercury. The goal of the initiative was to reduce the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury emissions of power plants over the course of 15 years, while saving consumers millions of dollars. Among other things, the Clear Skies Act states that it would: * Cut mercury emissions by 69 percent, ‚Äì the first-ever national cap on mercury emissions. Emissions will be cut from current emissions of 48 tons to a cap of 26 tons in 2010, and 15 tons in 2018. * Cut emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) by 67 percent, from emissions of 5 million tons to a cap of 2.1 million tons in 2008, and to 1.7 million tons in 2018 * Cut sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 73 percent, from emissions of 11 million tons to a cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010, and 3 million tons in 2018. * Emission caps will be set to account for different air quality needs in the East and the West. * Section 483 of the Bill exempt some older building from many of the provisions of the Bill, but must still meet carbon monoxide standards. The Natural Resources Defense Council, and its more than 500,000 members, examined the administration proposal and concluded it would harm public health, weaken current pollution fighting programs and worsen global warming. S. 385, the administration's bill to amend the Clean Air Act would: 1\\\\. Allow power plant pollution to continue to inflict huge, avoidable health damages on the public. 2\\\\. Repeal or interfere with major health and air quality safeguards in current law. 3\\\\. Worsen global warming by ignoring CO2 emissions from the power sector.US Senate Committee Hearing, April 8, 2003, \\"Testimony of the Natural Resources Defense Council\\" by David G. Hawkins,  Energy  offshore oil drill ban, June 18, 2008 In 2005‚Äì06, Bush emphasized the need for comprehensive energy reform and proposed increased funding for research and development of renewable sources of energy such as hydrogen power, nuclear power, ethanol, and clean coal technologies. Bush proposed the American Competitiveness Initiative which seeks to support increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy, with greater development of advanced technologies, as well as greater education and support for American students. In his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \\"America is addicted to oil\\" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research. In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, \\"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\\" Bush had said in June 2008, \\"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\\" In his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, \\"Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.\\" He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, \\"This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.\\"  National preserves  On June 15, 2006, Bush created the seventy-fifth, and largest, National Monument in U.S. history and the largest Marine Protected Area in the world with the formation of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument.  Economy  George W. Bush speaks to firefighters on November 4, 2003, as California Governor-Elect Arnold Schwarzenegger and Governor Gray Davis listen. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the economy suffered from a recession that lasted from March 2001 to November 2001. During the Bush Administration, Real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5%. Inflation under Bush has remained near historic lows at about 2‚Äì3% per year. The recession and a drop in some prices led to concern about deflation from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, high oil prices have caused concern about increasing inflation. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits. Under the Bush administration, productivity has grown by an average of 3.76% per year, the highest such average in ten years. While the GDP recovered from a recession that some claim Bush inherited from the previous administration, poverty has since worsened according to the Census Bureau. The percentage of the population below the poverty level increased in each of Bush's first four years, while it decreased for each of the prior seven years to an 11-year low. Although the poverty level increased the increase was still lower from 2000 to 2002 than it was from 1992 to 1997, which reached a peak of 39.3% in 1993. In 2002 the poverty rate was 34.6% which was almost equal to the rate in 1998, which was 34.5%. Poverty was at 12.7% in 2004. = Taxes = President Bush won passage for two major tax cuts during his term in office: The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the \\"Bush tax cuts\\". The cuts, scheduled to expire a decade after passage, increased the standard income tax deduction for married couples, eliminated the estate tax, and reduced marginal tax rates. Bush asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, but others wanted the cuts to be wholly or partially repealed even before their scheduled expiration, seeing the decrease in revenue while increasing spending as fiscally irresponsible. Bush's supporters claim that the tax cuts increase the pace of economic recovery and job creation. They also claim that total benefits to wealthier individuals are a reflection of higher taxes paid. Individual income tax rate provisions in the 2001 law, for instance, created larger marginal tax rate decreases for people earning less than US$12,000 than any other earners. President George W. Bush addresses the media during a visit to the National Security Agency in Fort Meade, Maryland. His opponents contest job prediction claims, primarily noting that the increase in job creation predicted by Bush's plan failed to materialize. They instead allege that the purpose of the tax cuts was intended to favor the wealthy and special interests, as the majority of benefit from the tax cut, in absolute terms, went to earners in the higher tax brackets. Bush's opponents additionally claim that the tax cuts are a major reason Bush reversed a national surplus into a historically large deficit. In an open letter to Bush in 2004, more than 100 professors of business and economics at U.S. business schools ascribed this \\"fiscal reversal\\" to Bush's \\"policy of slashing taxes ‚Äì primarily for those at the upper reaches of the income distribution.\\" By 2004, these cuts had reduced federal tax revenues, as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, to the lowest level since 1959. With the NASDAQ crash and one quarter of negative growth in 2000 it was likely we were headed into a recession, yet merely two years after the 2003 Bush tax cuts, federal revenues (in dollars) had reached a record high. The effect of simultaneous record increases in spending and tax reductions was to create record budget deficits in absolute terms, though as recently as 1993, the deficit was slightly larger than the current 3.6% of the GDP. In the last year of the Clinton administration, the federal budget showed an annual surplus of more than US$230 billion. Under Bush, the government returned to deficit spending. The annual deficit reached an absolute record of US$374 billion in 2003 and then a further record of $413 billion in 2004. = Spending = President Bush expanded public spending by 70 percent, more than double the increase under President Clinton. Bush was the first president in 176 years to continue an entire term without vetoing any legislation. The tax cuts, recession, and increases in outlays all contributed to record budget deficits during the Bush administration. The annual deficit reached record current-dollar levels of US$374 billion in 2003 and US$413 billion in 2004. National debt, the cumulative total of yearly deficits, rose from US$5.7 trillion (58% of GDP) to US$8.3 trillion (67% of GDP) under Bush, as compared to the US$2.7 trillion total debt owed when Ronald Reagan left office, which was 52% of the GDP. According to the \\"baseline\\" forecast of federal revenue and spending by the Congressional Budget Office (in its January 2005 Baseline Budget Projections), the budget deficits will decrease over the next several years. In this projection the deficit will fall to US$368 billion in 2005, US$261 billion in 2007, and US$207 billion in 2009, with a small surplus by 2012. The CBO noted, however, that this projection \\"omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year ‚Äî and possibly for some time to come ‚Äî for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and for other activities related to the global War on Terrorism.\\" The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts \\"will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010.\\" If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then \\"the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion.\\" Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy. Federal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first four and a half years. Non-defense spending increased 18% in that time. Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about US$450 billion are planned to be spent on defense. This level is generally comparable to the defense spending during the cold war. Congress approved US$87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in November, and had approved an earlier US$79 billion package last spring. Most of those funds were for U.S. military operations in the two countries. Former President Clinton's last budget featured an increase of 16% on domestic non security discretionary spending. Growth under President Bush was cut to 6.2% in his first budget, 5.5% in his second, 4.3% in his third, and 2.2% in his fourth. = Trade = President Bush signed a large number of free trade agreements into law during his Presidency: Jordan (2001), Singapore and Chile (2004), Australia (2005), Dominican Republic, CAFTA, Morocco, Oman, and Bahrain (2006), and Oman and Peru (2009). The Bush administration also launched trade negotiations with New Zealand, Thailand, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, with some being completed during President Obama's first term in office (2009‚Äì2013). However, Bush resorted to protectionist policies on occasion. Tariffs on imported steel and on Canadian softwood lumber were controversial in light of his advocacy of free market policies in other areas. The steel tariff was later lifted after the World Trade Organization ruled them illegal. Bush explained that the safeguard measures had \\"achieved their purpose\\", and \\"as a result of changed economic circumstances\\", it was time to lift them. A negotiated settlement to the softwood lumber dispute was reached in April 2006, and the historic seven-year deal was finalized on July 1, 2006. = Regulation = Some say economic regulation expanded rapidly during the Bush administration. President Bush is described by these observers as the biggest regulator since President Richard Nixon. Bush administration increased the number of new pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100 million a year, increased by 70%. Spending on regulation increased by 62% from $26.4 billion to $42.7 billion. The 2008 financial crisis occurred near the end of the Bush second term and has been regarded by some as an enormous failure of financial deregulation. = Employment = Unemployment percentage, 2000‚Äì2005 Looking at the annual average unemployment rates for each of the eight years of Bush's presidency, the average of all eight figures, and thus of his entire presidency, is 5.26%, with a low of 4.6% for the years of 2006 and 2007, and a high of 6.0% for 2003. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed was nearly 6.0 million in January 2001 and 6.9 million in September 2006. The unemployment rate was 4.2% in January 2001, 4.6% in September 2006, and 7.2% in December 2008. Employment peaked in late 1999 and declined through 2008. Poverty Rate, 1973 to 2004 The Current Population Survey (aka Household Survey) measures the percentage of the population that is employed and unemployed. The result can be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that the percentage of the population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration. Private sector employment, as measured by private nonfarm payrolls, shrank over the 8 years of the George W. Bush presidency. There were modest gains in private-sector payroll employment during his first term, but these were more than offset by the shedding of workers by the private sector in his second term. There were 463,000 fewer private-sector payroll jobs when he left office than when he came into office. = Economic Report = In 2004, a full chapter on Iraq's economy was excised from the Economic Report of the President, in part because it doesn't fit the \\"feel good\\" tone of the writing, according to White House officials.  Education  = No Child Left Behind = President Bush signing the No Child Left Behind Act into law, January 8, 2002 In January 2002, Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy as chief sponsor, which aims to close the achievement gap, measures student performance, provides options to parents with children in low- performing schools, and targets more federal funding to low-income schools. Critics, including Senator John Kerry and the National Education Association, say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based on premise that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce said that the Department of Education's overall funding increased by US$14 billion since the enactment of NCLB in fiscal year 2001, going from US$42.6 billion to US$56.6 billion in fiscal year 2005. Some state governments are refusing to implement provisions of the act as long as they are not adequately funded. In January 2005, USA Today reported that the United States Department of Education had paid US$240,000 to African-American conservative political commentator Armstrong Williams \\"to promote the law on his nationally syndicated television show and to urge other black journalist to do the same.\\" Williams did not disclose the payments. The House Education and Workforce Committee stated, \\"As a result of the No Child Left Behind Act, signed by Bush on January 8, 2002, the Federal government today is spending more money on elementary and High School (K-12) education than at any other time in the history of the United States. Funding increases have to a large degree been offset at the state level by increased costs associated with implementing NCLB, as well as the impacts of the economic downturn on education budgets.  Diversity and civil rights  = Faith-based initiatives = In early-2001, President Bush worked with Republicans in Congress to pass legislation changing the way the federal government regulated, taxed and funded charities and non-profit initiatives run by religious organizations. Although prior to the legislation it was possible for these organizations to receive federal assistance, the new legislation removed reporting requirements, which required the organizations to separate their charitable functions from their religious functions. Bush also created the White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives. Days into his first term, Bush announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations. Bush created the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith- based service organizations. Critics claimed that this was an infringement of the separation of church and state. President George W. Bush meets with his cabinet after his re-election. = LGBT issues = As Governor of Texas, Bush had opposed efforts to repeal the criminal prohibition on \\"homosexual conduct\\", the same law that the United States Supreme Court overturned in 2003, Lawrence v. Texas. During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of gay rights legislation, although he did meet with an approved group of Log Cabin Republicans, a first for a Republican presidential candidate. In his first four years of office, his views on gay rights were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal President Clinton's Executive Order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but its critics felt it was ignored. He did not attempt to repeal Don't ask, don't tell, nor try to change it. He threatened to veto the Matthew Shepard Act, which would have included sexual orientation in hate crimes. While President Bush had always been on record as opposing the legal recognition of same-sex marriages, the 2004 Republican campaign strategy was to focus on \\"value issues\\" such as a Federal Marriage Amendment, that would prohibit same- sex couples from obtaining any legal recognition. President Bush endorsed this proposed amendment, but late in the campaign told ABC News and Larry King that he did not have a problem with state legislators enacting some type of civil unions legislation, although critics charged that the constitutional amendment he endorsed did not permit recognition of such unions. Bush still expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment in his February 2, 2005 State of the Union address and during the 2006 midterm election, but given that it did not even receive majority support in the Senate, has ignored this issue in his most recent public statements and speeches. Bush was the first Republican president to appoint an openly gay man to serve in his administration, Scott Evertz, as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy. In addition, during Bush's first term, his nominee as ambassador to Romania, Michael E. Guest, became the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate as a U.S. ambassador. The first openly gay ambassador, James Hormel, received a recess appointment from Bill Clinton after the Senate failed to confirm the nomination. = Racial diversity = According to a CNN exit poll, Bush's support from African-Americans increased during his presidency from 9% of the black vote in 2000 to 11% in 2004. An increase in Ohio (from 9% to 16%, each ¬± about 5%) may have helped give the victory to Bush over Kerry. Although Bush expressed appreciation for the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the selection of college applicants for purposes of diversity, his Administration filed briefs against it. Bush has said he opposes government sanctioned and enforced quotas and racial preferences, but that the private and public sector should be encouraged to reach out to accomplished minorities to increase employment diversity. In August 2005, a report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights states that \\"the government fails to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives as the Constitution requires.\\" Chairman Gerald A. Reynolds explained, \\"Federal agencies do not independently evaluate, conduct research, collect data, or periodically review programs to determine whether race- neutral strategies will provide an adequate alternative to race-conscious programs.\\" Civil rights groups expressed concern that the report was an attack on affirmative action inconsistent with Grutter v. Bollinger. In his first term, Bush appointed Colin Powell as Secretary of State. Powell was the first African-American man to serve in that position, and was succeeded by Condoleezza Rice: Rice became the first African-American woman to hold the post. In 2005, he appointed Alberto Gonzales as the United States Attorney General, the first Hispanic to hold that position. Bush met with the National Urban League, the nation's oldest civil rights organization during his term of office as well. =Genetic non-discrimination= President George W. Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/GINAMay2008.pdf The bill protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.  Health  = Health care = In July 2002, Bush cut off U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Bush stated that the UNFPA supported forced abortions and sterilizations in the People's Republic of China. Bush sought to expand Medicare so it would also cover the cost of prescription drugs, a program that became known as Medicare Part D. Many congressional Democrats opposed the bill because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of drugs, while many conservative Republicans opposed the expansion of the government's involvement in healthcare. Assisted by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Bush overcame strong opposition and won passage of his Medicare bill.Smith (2016), pp. 390‚Äì391 In December 2003, Bush signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, the largest expansion of Medicare since the program's creation in 1965.Mann (2015), pp. 88‚Äì89 Bush signed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003, having declared his aim to \\"promote a culture of life\\". In 2007, Bush vetoed the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program stating his concern that the bill would \\"federalize health care\\". His veto was criticized as the bill as insensitive to children's needs. = Abortion = On his first day in office, President Bush implemented the Mexico City Policy; this policy required nongovernmental organizations receiving federal funds to agree not to perform abortions or to actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations. In 2002, President Bush signed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which extends legal protection to infants born alive after failed attempts at induced abortion. Also in 2002, President Bush withdrew funding from the United Nations Population Fund based on a finding that UNPF's activities facilitated China's one-child-only/forced abortion policy. In 2003, President Bush signed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act into law; that law was later upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Gonzales v. Carhart. President Bush signed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act (Laci and Conner's Law), which provides that a person who commits certain federal violent crimes and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury to, a fetus shall be guilty of a separate offense, whether or not the person knew the mother was pregnant or intended to harm the fetus. = Euthanasia = Bush staunchly opposes euthanasia. He supported Ashcroft's decision to file suit against the voter-approved Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court in favor of the Oregon law. As governor of Texas, however, Bush had signed a law which gave hospitals the authority to take terminally ill patients off of life support against the wishes of their spouse or parents, if the doctors deemed it medically appropriate. This became an issue in 2005, when the President signed controversial legislation forwarded and voted on by only three members of the Senate to initiate federal intervention in the Terri Schiavo case.  Social Security  Shortly after his second inauguration, Bush (here seen with a panel in Omaha, Nebraska) toured the nation to promote his proposal for Social Security (United States) personal accounts. President Bush discussing Social Security reform at the Lake Nona YMCA Family Center in Orlando, Florida, March 18, 2005 President George W. Bush discussing Social Security in 2005 After winning re-election in 2004, Bush made the partial privatization of Social Security his top domestic priority.Draper (2007), pp. 295‚Äì296 He proposed restructuring the program so that citizens could invest some of the money they paid in payroll taxes, which fund the Social Security program.Smith (2016), pp. 425‚Äì426 The president argued that Social Security faced an imminent funding crisis and that reform was necessary to ensure its continuing solvency. Bush expected a difficult congressional battle over his proposal, but, as he put it, \\"I've got political capital, and I intend to spend it.\\"Draper (2007), pp. 294‚Äì295 Groups like the AARP strongly opposed the plan, as did moderate Democrats like Max Baucus, who had supported the Bush tax cuts. Ultimately, Bush failed to win the backing of a single congressional Democrat for his plan, and even moderate Republicans like Olympia Snowe and Lincoln Chafee refused to back privatization. In the face of unified opposition, Republicans abandoned Bush's Social Security proposal in mid-2005.Draper (2007), pp. 293, 300‚Äì304 Bush called for major reforms in Social Security, identifying the system's projected insolvency as a priority early in his second term. From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending \\"crisis\\". Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax (FICA) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims. Most Democrats and some Republicans are critical of such ideas, partly because of the large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.

It stars Joe Don Baker as a Texas sheriff who overturns a Maltese city to find the mobster who killed his partner. The film was lampooned in a 1999 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Now infamous for its poor quality, it is among the lowest rated movies on the Internet Movie Database. Plot Mafiosi Joseph Palermo (Venantino Venantini) and his brother Tony are fleeing across the border after assassinating a building contractor. They get into a car accident and, after killing the driver of the other car, they decide to hijack a car from a local police station. In the ensuing firefight, Palermo shoots and kills the sheriff (Greydon Clark). The gangsters are pursued across the border by the sheriff's deputy, a no-nonsense Apache-descendent (or so he claims) named Thomas Jefferson Geronimo III (Baker). He shoots Tony dead and captures Joseph, who swears he will take revenge for his brother's death. As a publicity stunt, a US State Department official named Wilson (Bill McKinney) orders Geronimo to escort Palermo to Italy. However, the plane is sabotaged and forced to land in Malta. Soon after arriving in Valletta, Geronimo is ambushed by gangsters and Palermo escapes his custody. The Maltese police, under the command of Superintendent Mifsud (Lino Grech), assure Geronimo that they will recapture Palermo themselves. Chief Wilson telephones and orders Geronimo to return to Texas. But Geronimo is determined to capture Palermo himself. With the help of a local policewoman, Maria Cassar (Helena Dalli), he eventually tracks Palermo to the estate of Don Lamanna, a local bigwig. Geronimo is repeatedly arrested by the Maltese authorities, but always manages to escape and continue his pursuit of the gangster. Eventually, it turns out that Palermo was in cahoots with Wilson, who had never intended for Geronimo to deliver Palermo to Italy. In the end, Cassar kills Wilson and Geronimo kills Palermo. Commentaries The film was featured in the eighth episode of MST3K's tenth season. It is the second Joe Don Baker film to be riffed on MST3K, following Mitchell, to which a few references were made in this episode. The version of the film used in the MST3K episode contains a very prominent editing mistake. Early in the film when the sheriff (played by director Greydon Clark) dies, there is a shot of the partner getting killed and collapsing to the ground. Moments later, the exact shot is repeated. This error only appears in a television print, and the original Vestron Video release does not contain this mistake. In 2017 RiffTrax released a downloadable version of Final Justice with a new comedic commentary, distinct from the MST3K version. It is the fourth Greydon Clark film to receive the RiffTrax treatment, following Angels Revenge, Stargames, and Uninvited. In contrast to the MST3K version, the RiffTrax VOD uses the complete, uncensored version of the film.

In music history, the term has had several different usages, which fit into two general categories: the opera intermezzo and the instrumental intermezzo. Renaissance intermezzo The Renaissance intermezzo was also called the intermedio. It was a masque-like dramatic piece with music, which was performed between the acts of a play at Italian court festivities on special occasions, especially weddings. By the late 16th century, the intermezzo had become the most spectacular form of dramatic performance, and an important precursor to opera. The most famous examples were created for Medici weddings in 1539, 1565, and 1589. In Baroque Spain the equivalent entrem√©s or paso was a one-act comic scene, often ending in music and dance, between jornadas (acts) of a play.Lewis W. Heniford 1/2/3/4 for the Show: A Guide to Small-cast One-act Plays 0810836009 1995 \\"A paso is a seventeenth-century Spanish one-act comic scene, which became synonymous with entremes (a short comic interlude often ending in music and dance that played between jornadas, the acts of a long play)\\" Opera intermezzo The intermezzo, in the 18th century, was a comic operatic interlude inserted between acts or scenes of an opera seria. These intermezzi could be substantial and complete works themselves, though they were shorter than the opera seria which enclosed them; typically they provided comic relief and dramatic contrast to the tone of the bigger opera around them, and often they used one or more of the stock characters from the opera or from the commedia dell'arte. In this they were the reverse of the Renaissance intermezzo, which usually had a mythological or pastoral subject as a contrast to a main comic play. Often they were of a burlesque nature, and characterized by slapstick comedy, disguises, dialect, and ribaldry. The most famous of all intermezzi from the period is Pergolesi's La serva padrona, which was an opera buffa that after the death of Pergolesi kicked off the Querelle des Bouffons. In some cases the intermezzo repertory spread more quickly than did the opera seria itself; the singers were often renowned, the comic effects were popular, and intermezzi were relatively easy to produce and stage. In the 1730s the style spread around Europe, and some cities‚Äîfor example Moscow‚Äîrecorded visits and performances by troupes performing intermezzi years before any actual opera seria were done. The interm√®de (the French equivalent of the intermezzo) was the single most important outside operatic influence in Paris in the mid-18th century, and helped create an entire new repertory of opera in France (see op√©ra comique). The word was used (with a hint of irony) as the title of Richard Strauss's two-act opera, Intermezzo (1924), the scale of which far exceeds the intermezzo of tradition. Many of the most celebrated intermezzi are from operas of the verismo period: Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana and L'amico Fritz, Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Puccini's Manon Lescaut and Suor Angelica, Giordano's Fedora, Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur, and especially that from Massenet's Thais, which became known as the M√©ditation. Instrumental intermezzo In the 19th century, the intermezzo acquired another meaning: an instrumental piece which was either a movement between two others in a larger work, or a character piece which could stand on its own. These intermezzi show a wide variation in the style and function: in Mendelssohn's incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream the intermezzo serves as musical connecting material for action in Shakespeare's play; in chamber music by Mendelssohn and Brahms, the intermezzi are names for interior movements which would otherwise be called scherzi; and the piano intermezzi by Brahms, some of his last compositions, are sets of independent character pieces not intended to connect anything else together. Stylistically, intermezzi of the 19th century are usually lyrical and melodic, especially compared to the movements on either side, when they occur in larger works. The Brahms piano intermezzi in particular have an extremely wide emotional range, and are often considered some of the finest character pieces written in the 19th century. Opera composers sometimes wrote instrumental intermezzi as connecting pieces between acts of operas. In this sense, an intermezzo is similar to the entr'acte. The most famous of this type of intermezzo is probably the intermezzo from Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. Puccini also wrote intermezzi for Manon Lescaut and Madama Butterfly, and examples exist by Wolf-Ferrari, Delius and others. Also, incidental music for plays usually contained several intermezzi. Schubert's Rosamunde music as well as Grieg's Peer Gynt contained several intermezzi for the respective plays. In the 20th century, the term was used occasionally. Shostakovich named one movement of his dark String Quartet No. 15 \\"intermezzo\\"; Bart√≥k used the term for the fourth movement (of five) of his Concerto for Orchestra.

Born in Nova Scotia, he was the great-grandson of Governor Jonathan Belcher. He was briefly married to Diana Jolliffe, stepdaughter of Captain Peter Heywood, that marriage ending upon her application for legal separation for his having infected her with venereal disease.Dictionary of Hong Kong Biography, Hong Kong University Press 2012, p. 24. Biography =Early life= Belcher was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the second son of Andrew Belcher and entered the Royal Navy in 1812. =Surveys= In 1825, he accompanied Frederick William Beechey's expedition to the Pacific and Bering Strait as a surveyor. In 1836. he commanded a surveying ship on the north and west coasts of Africa and in the British seas. Belcher took up the work which Beechey had left unfinished on the Pacific coast of South America. He was on board , which was ordered to return to England in 1839 via the Trans-Pacific route. Belcher made various observations at a number of islands which he visited, having been delayed by being despatched to take part in the war in China in 1840. On 25 January 1841, Commander Belcher landed on Possession Point at the north shore Hong Kong Island and made the first British survey of Hong Kong harbour. After the war's end in 1842 he reached home and for his services was made a Knight Bachelor in the following year. He was then engaged on , in surveying work in the East Indies, the Philippines, Port Hamilton, and other places, until 1847. =Arctic expedition= In 1852 Belcher led the last and largest Admiralty expedition to rescue Sir John Franklin. He was also to look for his former surveying officer in Hong Kong, Sir Richard Collinson, and Sir Robert McClure, whose ships had not been seen after entering the Bering Strait. He did a great deal of sledge exploration, rescued McClure and abandoned four of his five ships in the ice. He had five ships: (Belcher), (Henry Kellett, second mate George Nares), the steam tenders Pioneer (Sherard Osborn) and Intrepid (Sir Leopold McClintock) and the depot ship (William Pullen). Belcher and one tender were to enter Wellington Channel, where Franklin was thought to be, while Kellett was to go west to Melville Island and look for Collinson and McClure. North Star was to stay at Beechey Island as a supply base. He left the Nore in April 1850. By early winter Assistance and Pioneer were frozen in at Northumberland Sound to the north of Wellington Channel while Resolute and Intrepid were frozen in off Melville Island ‚Äîthe first ships this far West since Sir William Edward Parry in 1819. A great deal of exploration was done by manhauled sledges. In April 1853 Leopold McClintock and others left Resolute on sledges and returned 105 days later, having covered and discovered Prince Patrick Island. Another party went West and discovered Robert McClure, whose ship was frozen in at Mercy Bay. Belcher went north by sledge and found a channel at the northern tip of Devon Island, hinting that Franklin might have used it to escape to Baffin Bay. When the ice broke up that summer, he pushed his ships up Wellington Channel and became trapped again. By February 1854, Belcher was becoming increasingly worried about the safety of his ships and men. In April he ordered Kellett to abandon his ships and return by sledge to North Star. Belcher abandoned his two ships in late July. Aided by two ships that showed up at Beechey Island ( and ), the whole party returned to England. Belcher went through a court martial, which was automatic for any captain who had lost a ship. H M S North Star destroying Pomare's PƒÅ, 1845. Painting by John Williams.

He never again received an active command. Curiously Resolute broke free of the ice and drifted all the way to Davis Strait, where it was picked up by an American whaler. The American government graciously returned the ship to the United Kingdom, and when many years later the ship was broken up, its timbers were used to make a desk for the American president by way of a thank you. This Resolute desk, a gift from Queen Victoria, is still used today in the Oval Office. =Later life= Following his last active service, Belcher was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1867, and an admiral in 1872.  Legacy  Belcher is commemorated in Hong Kong through Belcher's Street, Belcher Bay and The Belcher's in Kennedy Town. His name is also commemorated in the Belcher Islands, in the Canadian Arctic.

Two events will be simultaneous when they are on a line hyperbolically orthogonal to a particular time line. This dependence on a certain time line is determined by velocity, and is the basis for the relativity of simultaneity. Geometry Two lines are hyperbolic orthogonal when they are reflections of each other over the asymptote of a given hyperbola. Two particular hyperbolas are frequently used in the plane: :(A) xy = 1 with y = 0 as asymptote. :When reflected in the x-axis, a line y = mx becomes y = ‚àímx. :In this case the lines are hyperbolic orthogonal if their slopes are additive inverses. :(B) x2 ‚àí y2 = 1 with y = x as asymptote. :For lines y = mx with ‚àí1 < m < 1, when x = 1/m, then y = 1. :The point (1/m , 1) on the line is reflected across y = x to (1, 1/m). :Therefore the reflected line has slope 1/m and the slopes of hyperbolic orthogonal lines are reciprocals of each other. The relation of hyperbolic orthogonality actually applies to classes of parallel lines in the plane, where any particular line can represent the class. Thus, for a given hyperbola and asymptote A, a pair of lines (a, b) are hyperbolic orthogonal if there is a pair (c, d) such that a \\\\rVert c ,\\\\ b \\\\rVert d , and c is the reflection of d across A. Similar to the perpendularity of a circle radius to the tangent, a radius to a hyperbola is hyperbolic orthogonal to a tangent to the hyperbola.Bj√∏rn Felsager (2004), Through the Looking Glass ‚Äì A glimpse of Euclid‚Äôs twin geometry, the Minkowski geometry , ICME-10 Copenhagen; pages 6 & 7. A bilinear form is used to describe orthogonality in analytic geometry, with two elements orthogonal when their bilinear form vanishes. In the plane of complex numbers z_1 =u + iv, \\\\quad z_2 = x + iy, the bilinear form is xu + yv, while in the plane of hyperbolic numbers w_1 = u + jv,\\\\quad w_2 = x +jy, the bilinear form is xu - yv . :The vectors z1 and z2 in the complex number plane, and w1 and w2 in the hyperbolic number plane are said to be respectively Euclidean orthogonal or hyperbolic orthogonal if their respective inner products [bilinear forms] are zero.Sobczyk, G.(1995) Hyperbolic Number Plane, also published in College Mathematics Journal 26:268‚Äì80. The bilinear form may be computed as the real part of the complex product of one number with the conjugate of the other. Then :z_1 z_2^* + z_1^* z_2 = 0 entails perpendicularity in the complex plane, while :w_1 w_2^* + w_1^* w_2 = 0 implies the w's are hyperbolic orthogonal. The notion of hyperbolic orthogonality arose in analytic geometry in consideration of conjugate diameters of ellipses and hyperbolas.Barry Spain (1957) Analytical Conics, ellipse ¬ß33, page 38 and hyperbola ¬ß41, page 49, from Hathi Trust if g and g‚Ä≤ represent the slopes of the conjugate diameters, then g g' = - \\\\frac{b^2}{a^2} in the case of an ellipse and g g' = \\\\frac{b^2}{a^2} in the case of a hyperbola. When a = b the ellipse is a circle and the conjugate diameters are perpendicular while the hyperbola is rectangular and the conjugate diameters are hyperbolic-orthogonal. In the terminology of projective geometry, the operation of taking the hyperbolic orthogonal line is an involution. Suppose the slope of a vertical line is denoted ‚àû so that all lines have a slope in the projectively extended real line. Then whichever hyperbola (A) or (B) is used, the operation is an example of a hyperbolic involution where the asymptote is invariant. Hyperbolically orthogonal lines lie in different sectors of the plane, determined by the asymptotes of the hyperbola, thus the relation of hyperbolic orthogonality is a heterogeneous relation on sets of lines in the plane. Simultaneity Since Hermann Minkowski's foundation for spacetime study in 1908, the concept of points in a spacetime plane being hyperbolic-orthogonal to a timeline (tangent to a world line) has been used to define simultaneity of events relative to the timeline. In Minkowski's development the hyperbola of type (B) above is in use. :*Various English translations on Wikisource: Space and Time Two vectors (, , , ) and (, , , ) are normal (meaning hyperbolic orthogonal) when :c^{2} \\\\ t_1 \\\\ t_2 - x_1 \\\\ x_2 - y_1 \\\\ y_2 - z_1 \\\\ z_2 = 0. When = 1 and the s and s are zero, ‚â† 0, ‚â† 0, then \\\\frac{c \\\\ t_1}{x_1} = \\\\frac{x_2}{c \\\\ t_2}. Given a hyperbola with asymptote A, its reflection in A produces the conjugate hyperbola. Any diameter of the original hyperbola is reflected to a conjugate diameter. The directions indicated by conjugate diameters are taken for space and time axes in relativity. As E. T. Whittaker wrote in 1910, \\"[the] hyperbola is unaltered when any pair of conjugate diameters are taken as new axes, and a new unit of length is taken proportional to the length of either of these diameters.\\"E.

After being let down by publishers Innerprise, Hoi was eventually released by Hollyware Entertainment (formerly Micro-Illusions) in 1992. However, the developers did not receive much money from their contract and they decided to release a special freeware remix of the original 2-disc Hoi game for the new Advanced Graphics Architecture Amiga system range. Critical reaction The international Amiga gaming press received Hoi favourably; Amiga Mania, Joystick, Amiga World and The One all gave review scores of 80% or higher. Amiga Action said the game was adequate for beginners, but that more advanced players should look elsewhere. Amiga Mania thought a lot of effort was put into every aspect of the game. Amiga Power called it \\"amazingly frustrating junk\\". The One felt it was pretty standard from a graphics perspective. Amiga Format felt it was playable and fun.

Silk plain weave with supplementary weft-float patterning, stiffened with whalebone. Los Angeles County Museum of Art, M.63.24.5. The corset has been an indispensable article of clothing for several centuries in Europe, evolving as fashion trends have changed. Women, as well as some men, have used it to change the appearance of their bodies. The corset first became popular in sixteenth-century Europe, reaching the zenith of its popularity in the Victorian era. While the corset has typically been worn as an undergarment, it has occasionally been used as an outer- garment; corsets as outer-garments can be seen in the national dress of many European countries. Etymology The English word corset is derived from the Old French word corps and the diminutive of body, which itself derives from corpus‚ÄîLatin for body. The term \\"corset‚Äù was in use in the late 14th century, from the French \\"corset\\" which meant \\"a kind of laced bodice.\\" The meaning of it as a \\"stiff supporting and constricting undergarment for the waist, worn chiefly by women to shape the figure,\\" dates from 1795. In English, the term \\"bodies\\" or \\"pair of bodies\\" was used until the 1680s when it was replaced by the term \\"stays.\\" The term \\"corset\\" appears in the middle of the eighteenth century, and was used until the early twentieth century. Before the 16th century Minoan snake goddess (or priestess), wearing a corset-like garment, from the palace of Knossos, Crete: c.1600 BCE The earliest known representation of a possible corset appears on a Cretan figurine made circa 1600 BCE. The article of clothing depicted might be perceived as a corset, but is worn as an outer garment, and leaves the breasts exposed. Corsets have been used for centuries among certain tribes of the Caucasus: Circassians and Abkhaz. They were used to \\"beautify\\" women and also to ensure modesty. Corsets were laced tightly with as many as fifty laces, and had to be worn from childhood until the wedding night. When the marriage was consummated, a groom had to slowly and carefully undo each lace to demonstrate self-control. 16th and 17th centuries Henry III of France and Louise of Lorraine Iron corset from the late 16th century The corset as an undergarment had its origin in Italy, and was introduced by Catherine de Medici into France in the 1500s, where the women of the French court embraced it. This type of corset was a tight, elongated bodice that was worn underneath the clothing. The women of the French court saw this corset as \\"indispensable to the beauty of the female figure.\\" Corsets of this time were often worn with a farthingale that held out the skirts in a stiff cone. The corsets turned the upper torso into a matching but inverted cone shape. These corsets had shoulder straps and ended in flaps at the waist. They flattened the bust, and in so doing, pushed the breasts up. The intense tight-lacing that is seen in later centuries was not possible at this time, as the holes through which the laces were threaded were sewn by hand, and would tear if put under too much strain. Therefore the emphasis of the stays was less on the smallness of the waist than on the contrast between the rigid flatness of the bodice front and the curving tops of the breasts peeking over the top of the corset. These corsets were typically made out of layered fabric, stiffened with glue, and were tightly laced. While a few surviving corsets exist that are structured with steel or iron, these are generally considered to have been either orthopedic or novelty constructions and were not worn as part of mainstream fashion. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries bodies, as corsets were known then, were typically worn as both underwear and outerwear. There are many examples of bodies from these centuries that have detachable sleeves. Whalebone (baleen) was frequently used in bodies to maintain their stiff appearance. Bents (reeds) were also common. A busk, typically made of wood, horn, ivory, metal, or whalebone, was added to stiffen the front of the bodice. It was then carved and shaped into a thin knife shape and inserted into a pouch in the front of the bodice, then fastened and held into place by ribbon, so that the busk could be easily removed and replaced. The busk was often used for special occasions and events, and was sometimes presented to a woman by a suitor as a prize when he was interested in a female. The front of the corset was typically covered by a \\"stomacher,\\" a stiff, V-shaped structure that was worn on the abdomen for decorative purposes. Since the mid-Victorian period, the busk has been made of steel and consists of two parts, one for each side. One side has studs and the other eyes so that the corset can be easily fastened and unfastened from the front. During the late 1500s, when whalebone was used at the sides and back of the corset, the corset was laced up at the front. Eventually, the lacing came to be done at the back of the corset. Even as it gained popularity, the corset was not worn by everyone. Mary, Queen of Scots, for example, did not wear a corset. During the reign of Louis XV of France and again during the French Revolution, the corset went out of style, as the fashions were simpler. 18th and early 19th centuries The most common type of corset in the 1700s was an inverted conical shape, often worn to create a contrast between a rigid quasi- cylindrical torso above the waist and heavy full skirts below. The primary purpose of 18th-century stays was to raise and shape the breasts, tighten the midriff, support the back, improve posture to help a woman stand straight, with the shoulders down and back, and only slightly narrow the waist, creating a \\"V\\" shaped upper torso over which the outer garment would be worn; however, \\"jumps\\" of quilted linen were also worn instead of stays for informal situations. Deriving from the French word jupe, which in the eighteenth century referred to a short jacket, jumps were only partially boned and padded with cotton to provide support for the breasts while not being restrictive. Jumps were made of silk, cotton, or linen and often embroidered. Jumps fastened over the breasts with ties such as silk ribbons, buttons, and sometimes, metal hooks. Both garments were considered undergarments, and would be seen only under very limited circumstances. Well-fitting eighteenth-century corsets were quite comfortable, did not restrict breathing, and allowed women to work, although they did restrict bending at the waist, forcing one to protect one's back by lifting with the legs.Steele, V.

By 1800, the corset had become primarily a method of supporting the breasts, as the waist was raised to just under the bust line. Corsets still slimmed the torso, but this was not their primary purpose. Image:Regency- underclothes.pngRegency short stays circa 1810 Image:Corset ElastiqueFrench1803.gifShort stays circa 1803 Image:Nursing corset uspatent169159.pngNursing Corset US-Patent 169,159 (1875) The corset became less constricting with the advent of the high-waisted empire style (around 1796) which de-emphasized the natural waist. Some form of corset was still worn by most women of the time but these were often \\"short stays\\" (i.e. they did not extend very far below the breasts). By contrast, corsets intended to exert serious body-shaping force (as in the Victorian era) were \\"long\\" (extending down to and beyond the natural waist), laced in back, and stiffened with boning. Transition to the Victorian When the waistline returned to its natural position during the 1830s, the corset reappeared and served the dual purpose of supporting the breasts and narrowing the waist. However, it had changed its shape to the hourglass silhouette that is even now considered typical both for corsets and for Victorian fashion. At the same time, the term corset was first used for this garment in English. In the 1830s, the artificially inflated shoulders and skirts made the intervening waist look narrow, even with the corset laced only moderately. By the 1830s, steel stays had begun to replace the classic whalebone. The diarist Emily Eden recorded that she had to obtain a silver \\"husk\\" before accompanying her brother to India because a humid climate rusted the usual steel and spoilt the garment. In 1839, a Frenchman by the name of Jean Werly made a patent for women's corsets made on the loom. This type of corset was popular until 1890: when machine-made corsets gained popularity. As seen in various fashion advertisements of the era, the common corset cost one dollar ($1). Before this, all corsets were handmade - and, typically, home- made. The Victorian corset When the exaggerated shoulders disappeared, the waist itself had to be cinched tighter in order to achieve the same effect. The focus of the fashionable silhouette of the mid- and late 19th century was an hourglass figure with a tiny waist. It is in the 1840s and 1850s that tightlacing first became popular. The corset differed from the earlier stays in numerous ways. The corset no longer ended at the hips, but flared out and ended several inches below the waist. The corset was exaggeratedly curvaceous rather than funnel-shaped. Spiral steel stays curved with the figure. While many corsets were still sewn by hand to the wearer's measurements, there was also a thriving market in cheaper mass-produced corsets.

Late 19th century For dress reformists of the late 1800s, corsets were a dangerous moral ‚Äòevil‚Äô, promoting promiscuous views of female bodies and superficial dalliance into fashion whims. The obvious health risks, including damaged and rearranged internal organs, compromised fertility; weakness, and general depletion of health were also blamed on excessive corsetry. Eventually, the reformers' critique of the corset joined a throng of voices clamoring against tightlacing, which became gradually more common and extreme as the 19th century progressed. Preachers inveighed against tightlacing, doctors counseled patients against it and journalists wrote articles condemning the vanity and frivolity of women who would sacrifice their health for the sake of fashion. Whereas for many corseting was accepted as necessary for beauty, health, and an upright military-style posture, dress reformists viewed tightlacing as vain and, especially at the height of the era of Victorian morality, a sign of moral indecency. American women active in the anti-slavery and temperance movements, with experience in public speaking and political agitation, demanded sensible clothing that would not restrict their movement. While support for fashionable dress contested that corsets maintained an upright, ‚Äògood figure‚Äô, as a necessary physical structure for moral and well-ordered society, these dress reformists contested that women‚Äôs fashions were not only physically detrimental but ‚Äúthe results of male conspiracy to make women subservient by cultivating them in slave psychology.‚Äù They believed a change in fashions could change the whole position of women, allowing for greater social mobility, independence from men and marriage, the ability to work for wages, as well as physical movement and comfort. In 1873 Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote: Despite these protests, little changed in restrictive fashion and undergarments by 1900. The Edwardian corset 1900 illustration contrasting the old Victorian corseted silhouette with the new Edwardian \\"S-bend\\" corseted silhouette The straight-front corset, also known as the swan-bill corset, the S-bend corset, or the health corset, was worn from circa 1900 to the early 1910s. Its name is derived from the very rigid, straight busk inserted in the center front of the corset. This corset forced the torso forward and made the hips jut out in the back. The straight-front corset was popularized by , a corsetiere with a degree in medicine. It was intended to be less injurious to wearers' health than other corsets in that it exerted less pressure on the stomach area. However, any benefits to the stomach were more than counterbalanced by injury caused to the back due to the unnatural posture that it forced upon its wearer. At this time, the bust lowered and corsets provided much less support for the breasts. By ca. 1908, corsets began to fall from favor as the silhouette changed to a higher waistline and more naturalistic form. Early forms of brassieres were introduced and the girdle soon took the place of the corset. The girdle was more concerned with reducing the hips rather than the waist.

From 1908 to 1914, the fashionable narrow-hipped and narrow-skirted silhouette necessitated the lengthening of the corset at its lower edge. A new type of corset covered the thighs and changed the position of the hip, making the waist appear higher and wider. The new fashion was considered uncomfortable, cumbersome, and required the use of strips of elastic fabric. The development of rubberized elastic materials in 1911 helped the girdle replace the corset.Carlisle, Rodney (2004). Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries, p.102. John Wiley & Songs, Inc., New Jersey. . After World War I Shortly after the United States' entry into World War I in 1917, the U.S. War Industries Board asked women to stop buying corsets to free up metal for war production. This step liberated some 28,000 tons of metal, enough to build two battleships. The corset, which had been made using steel stays since the 1860s, further declined in popularity as women took to brassieres and girdles which also used less steel in their construction. However, body shaping undergarments were often called corsets and continued to be worn well into the 1920s. However, these garments were better known as girdle with the express purpose of reducing the hips in size. A return to waist nipping corsets in 1939 caused a stir in fashion circles but World War II ended their return. In 1952,Store Operations: Cinch Bra Gets Glamour Treatment. (1952, March 18).

Initially, the Merry Widow was a trademark of the famous Maidenform company, which designed it for Lana Turner's role in a 1952 movie of the same name. The Merry Widow differed from earlier corsets in that it separated the breasts, whereas corsets had held them together. Both the Merry Widow and girdles remained popular throughout the 1950s and 1960s. However, in 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can.\\" These included girdles and corsets, which were among items the protestors called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they argued were enforced femininity. In the 1990s, fetish fashion became popular, and corsets made something of a recovery, often worn as outer- rather than undergarments. By 2010, the corset had recovered a new popularity in fashion. By April 2017, corsets were receiving large numbers of reviews on Amazon, one UK garment attracting more than a thousand reviews. A similar garment in the USA received over two thousand reviews.

Etymology The name \\"candlefish\\" derives from it being so fat during spawning, with up to 15% of total body weight in fat, that if caught, dried, and strung on a wick, it can be burned as a candle. This is the name most often used by early explorers. The name eulachon (occasionally seen as oolichan, oulachon, and uthlecan) is from the Chinookan language and the Chinook Jargon based on that language. One of several theories for the origin of the name of the state of Oregon is that it was a corruption from the term \\"Oolichan Trail\\", the native trade route for oolichan oil. The unrelated sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria is also called \\"candlefish\\" in the United Kingdom. Species description Eulachon are distinguished by the large canine like teeth on the vomer bone and 18 to 23 rays in the anal fin. Like salmon and trout they have an adipose fin (aft of the dorsal); it is sickle- shaped. The paired fins are longer in males than in females. All fins have well-developed breeding tubercles (raised tissue \\"bumps\\") in ripe males, but these are poorly developed or absent in females. Adult coloration is brown to blue on the back and top of the head, lighter to silvery white on the sides, and white on the ventral surface; speckling is fine, sparse, and restricted to the back. Adults can reach maximum lengths of but most adults are between They feed on plankton but only while at sea. Ecology Eulachon feed primarily on plankton as well as fish eggs, insect larvae, and small crustaceans. It forms an important part of the diet of many ocean and shore predators, and serves as a prominent food source for people living near its spawning streams. Eulachon, as anadromous fish, spend most of their adult lives in the ocean but return to their natal freshwater streams and rivers to spawn and die As such, one stream may see regular large runs of eulachon while a neighboring stream sees few or none at all. Regular annual runs are common but not entirely predictable, and occasionally a river which has large runs sees a year with no returns; the reasons for such variability are not known. The eulachon run is characteristic for the early portion being almost entirely male, with females following about midway through the run to its conclusion. Males are easily distinguished from females during spawning by fleshy ridges which form along the length of their bodies. Economics and trade Eulachon rendering camp at the mouth of the Nass River, 1884. Indigenous communities of the Pacific Coast from California to Alaska made eulachon an important part of their diet, as well as a valuable trade item with peoples whose territories did not include spawning rivers. The species was caught using traps, rakes, and nets. The harvest continues today, with other residents taking part in the exploitation of the large runs. Today harvested eulachon are typically stored frozen and thawed as needed. They may also be dried, smoked, or canned. Eulachon were also processed for their rich oil. The usual process was to allow the fish to decompose for a week or more in a pit in the ground, then add boiling water and skim off the oil, which would rise to the surface. Eulachon oil (also known as \\"grease\\") was the most important product traded into the interior; as a result, the trails over which the trade was conducted came to be known as grease trails. Other uses of eulachon by non-Natives include bait for sportfishing and food for cats and dogs. Conservation status On November 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) received a petition from the Cowlitz Tribe to list a distinct population segment (DPS) of eulachon from Washington, Oregon, and California, (the so-called Southern DPS) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. (ESA). NMFS found that this petition presented enough information to warrant conducting a status review of the species. Based on the status review NMFS proposed listing this species as threatened on March 13, 2009. On March 16, 2010, NOAA announced that the Southern DPS of eulachon will be listed as threatened under the ESA, effective on May 17, 2010 (See: the Federal Register notice published on May 18, 2010, at 74 FR 3178). On September 6, 2017, the NMFS approved a recovery plan intended to serve as a blueprint for the protection and recovery of the southern Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) using the best available science per the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.

In addition to its main customer base in Ireland, the chain also has operations in Spain, and formerly in England and Scotland. The format of the chain's stores include a grocery supermarket operating alongside a clothing/textiles store. The grocery operation only operates in Irish stores and some Northern Irish stores, although some limited grocery ranges can be found in the Spanish stores. However some stores contain only textiles, while some (more rarely) contain only a supermarket. Dunnes Stores' original own brand of groceries was sold under the St Bernard brand for many years, becoming an Irish household name, but was rebranded as \\"My Family Favourites\\" in 2013. History =1940s‚Äì1950s= Ben Dunne began his retail career as an employee at a drapers shop in Cork, Ireland, in the 1940s. In 1943, however, Dunne left that shop to set up his own store just across the street. Dunne quickly set out to revolutionize the Irish retail market, and in 1944 opened a new store, on St Patrick's Street in Cork, which promised \\"Better Value\\" by offering goods at pre-war prices. Dunnes Stores in Limerick Through the end of the 1950s, Dunne established stores in Wexford, Waterford, Limerick and Dublin. Then, in 1963, Dunne grouped his growing number of stores under a new corporate structure, Dunnes Holding Company, which took over ownership of the entire operation. Dunne also set up a family trust at the same time, in part to ensure that the company remained family controlled. =1960s‚Äì1970s= Dunnes continued to expand during the 1960s, and in the middle of the decade sparked a new revolution in the Irish retail scene. Until then, the company's stores had operated, like the country's retail sector in general, in Ireland's city centre. In 1966, however, Dunnes opened a store at Cornelscourt in what was then Ireland's first out-of-town shopping centre. Although scoffed at by experts, who believed the company would fail at the new location, the Cornelscourt site was not only a success, but also became one of the company's flagship stores. By the end of the 1960s, Dunnes operated 17 stores across Ireland. The company remained intensely private and, despite an active advertising schedule, wary of publicity. As Ben Dunne explained, in what the Times described as a rare interview in 1971, \\"If there is one thing I hate it is publicity. No one is allowed to write about Ben Dunne. The people I do not like are the people who talk about what they have done and the people who talk about what they are going to do.\\" In that same interview, Dunne reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining family control of his business, saying: \\"Public companies are like the government. The government has the privilege of spending money foolishly and public companies are no better.\\" Countries with Dunnes Stores locations Dunnes Stores concentrated instead on expanding its growing retail empire. By the end of the 1970s, the company had built up a network of more than 60 stores. It also had moved beyond the Republic of Ireland, adding its first stores in Northern Ireland. =1980s‚Äì1990s= By the beginning of the 1980s, the company operated seven Northern Ireland stores. By then, too, Dunnes had made a move onto the European continent, opening a store in Spain, on that country's Costa del Sol, in 1980. The success of that venture led the company to begin construction on its second Spain store the following year, which opened in Marbella. By 1981, Dunnes Stores represented 66 locations, producing estimated sales revenues of some ¬£200 million. Dunne, by then in his 70s, had succeeded in building his company into one of Ireland's top ten firms. Dunne also had been joined by his five children, Frank, Margaret, Teresa, Elizabeth, and, especially, youngest son Bernard Dunne, Jr. The company became swept up in political events in that year when Ben Dunne, Jr., was kidnapped and held for several days by the IRA. Ben Dunne died of a heart attack in 1983. Although the business was nominally handed to all five of his children, most of whom played an active role in the company's operations, actual leadership of the company became the responsibility of his son Ben. Ben Dunne's tenure as leader of the family business came to an end in 1992, when he was arrested for cocaine possession in a Florida hotel. The resulting scandal led the other family members to oust their brother, resulting in a somewhat public battle among the otherwise publicity-shy family. In the end, the company paid IR¬£100 million to buy out Ben Dunne's share of the business. The family faced other tragedies, as sisters Teresa and Elizabeth both died at relatively young ages. Dunnes Stores in Kilnamanagh, Tallaght In the meantime, the alleged unorthodoxy of Ben Dunne's business practices, which included funneling Dunnes Stores funds into the offshore bank accounts of a number of Ireland's political figures, brought the company once again into the limelight in the late 1990s. The resulting political scandal had an additional consequence for the very private company, when the government announced in 1997 that it would appoint an authorized officer to inquire into the company's business practices under Ben Dunne. Dunnes faced other difficulties as well during the decade. British retail giant Tesco had entered the Irish market and gained steadily, capturing the number one retail spot away from Dunnes. At the same time, a new breed of deep-discount retailer, led by Germany's Aldi and Lidl chains, had entered Ireland, placing Dunnes' own discount formula under pressure. =2000s‚Äì2020= Dunnes logo from 2009 until 2014 Dunnes Stores in Ashbourne By the start of the 2000s, Dunnes' network had grown to more than 120 stores. In 2000, it launched a new store format, adapting the American-style convenience store concept for the Dublin market. By 2001, the company had opened a second store featuring the smaller format and had registered a new subsidiary name, Better Value Conveniently Yours Ltd., in what some observers saw as the company's intent on expanding its convenience store operations. In the meantime, Dunnes continued to open new stores, bringing its total to 125 stores. After entering Scotland for the first time in 2000, the company announced its intention to boost the number of British Dunnes stores by up to 25 by 2005. The company was said to have held buyout talks in 2000 with U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart, which had expressed an interest in entering Ireland. The Dunne family, however, decided to retain control of their business. In 2003, the Irish government at last appointed an authorized officer to look into Dunnes Stores' records. While the results of that investigation were to remain private, it nonetheless represented a new intrusion for the company's carefully guarded privacy. That same desire for privacy had reportedly led the company to quash a story slated to appear about Dunnes Stores in the Irish Independent, which allegedly chose not to run the story in order to safeguard the yearly ‚Ç¨1.6 million in advertising revenues provided by Dunnes Stores. In 2007, the company opened a new flagship store in Henry Street, Dublin. Also in 2007, architect Arthur Gibney & Partners designed a large commercial development on South Great George‚Äôs Street, Dublin as Headquarters for Dunnes Stores, which entailed the removal of some buildings and facade retention of several others, including the former Dunlop Factory on Stephen Street, and the Connolly Shoes building. The building has a dramatic glass corner atrium leading to an internal street through the development. The facade to George‚Äôs Street respects existing building heights. In recent years, Dunnes Stores has continued to consistently maintain a top-three market share in Ireland's grocery market, alongside SuperValu and Tesco. Combined, these three supermarket chains account for approximately 70% of Ireland's grocery market. The company owns 50% of the Asian fast food chain, Neon. In spring 2018, Dunnes Stores confirmed the closure of all stores in Britain. In 2018, Dunnes Stores commenced with a number of revamps and expansions on some of its stores with some, such as in Bishopstown and Ballyvolane in Cork and in a number of stores in Dublin including Donaghmede, Blanchardstown and Swords, all these being quite substantial multi-million-euro expansions. 2019 saw the opening of new stores in Naas, Ilac Centre and the refurbishment of stores in Jetland and Briarhill. Also in 2019 Dunnes Stores celebrated 75 years of business. Dunnes Stores opened their first Beauty Department in their Jetland Store ‚ÄòDunnes Beauty‚Äô. Dunnes Stores have been voted Ireland‚Äôs Number 1 supermarket each month for 2019, making them Ireland‚Äôs most popular supermarket. This continues on in 2020 with Dunnes Stores still being Ireland‚Äôs most popular supermarket. Dunnes Stores have continued with their popular voucher system in Ireland, ‚ÄúShop & Save‚Äù, giving you ‚Ç¨10 for every ‚Ç¨50 you spend on groceries in their supermarkets. This scheme is extremely popular with Irish consumers leading to Dunnes maintaining a strong and loyal relationship with their customers. In larger Dunnes Stores there usually consists of one of the following cafes: Cafe Sol, Dunnes Stores Cafe or Baxter & Greene Market Cafe. In the recently refurbished Dunnes Stores supermarkets there now contains a number of concessions including James Whelan Butchers, Sheridan‚Äôs Cheesemongers and Baxter & Greene Markets Delis. The main domestic competitors in the supermarket business are Tesco, SuperValu, Lidl and Aldi. In clothing, their rivals include Penneys, Marks and Spencer and Debenhams. Dunnes collaborate for many clothing/home wares collections from a number of Irish designers such as Paul Costelloe, Padraic Harrington, Carolyn Donnelly, Lennon Courtney and new clothing from Paul Galvin. They also sell in house clothings brands such as Savida and Gallery, along with their own Dunnes Stores brand of clothing. In March 2020, Dunnes Stores introduced priority shopping for the elderly and vulnerable between 11am and 1pm, in response to the high volume of customer traffic in the mornings, a result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Dunnes Stores also implement a strict social distancing policy in all stores. Controversies =South Africa boycott= In 1984, Mary Manning, a shop worker in the Henry Street, Dublin outlet, made international headlines when she led a picket for almost three years against the sale by Dunnes of oranges sourced in the then apartheid South Africa, in which Christy Moore wrote a song about the issue. The Irish Government eventually banned all imports from South Africa until the end of apartheid. The workers eventually met Nelson Mandela on the occasion of his conferral of the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1990. A plaque presented by President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki, commemorating the action, was unveiled in Dublin in June, 2008, and a street has been named after Mary in Johannesburg. Manning was invited to attend the Funeral of Nelson Mandela in 2013. =Bras for children= In September 2011, the Irish Independent found that Dunnes Stores was selling bra-and-knicker sets for three to six-year-old girls. Dunnes also has padded bras for girls with a 28 to 30-inch chest, which are the typical measurements of nine-year- old girls. =Burma boycott= An attempted boycott was made on Dunnes due to reports of selling goods made in Burma. =Mandate dispute= On 2 April 2015, members of the Mandate Trade Union had a one-day dispute at 109 branches of Dunnes Stores. The dispute concerned low-hour contracts (typically 15 hours per week), income and employment security, and the continued failure of Dunnes Stores to recognise or engage with the Mandate Trade Union, contrary to the recommendations of the impartial Labour Court.

He served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1946 and then worked as a journalist from 1954 to 1979, owning a chain of weekly community newspapers in the Chicago area. Savage was unsuccessful in his candidacy for the House of Representatives in 1968 and 1970, losing the Democratic primary both times, but won election to the House in 1980, representing the 2nd District on Chicago's South Side for 6 terms, from January 1981 to January 1993. In 1989, Savage was accused of trying to force himself on a female Peace Corps worker in Zaire.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/20/us/lawmaker-is-accused-of-sexual- impropriety.html He denied the allegations and blamed them on the \\"racist press.\\" The House Ethics Committee decided that the events did indeed occur, but it did not take disciplinary action only because Savage wrote a letter of apology. Savage had long been controversial even in his own district. His racially incendiary and anti-Semitic remarks frequently drew bipartisan criticism. He never won a primary election‚Äìthe real contest in this overwhelmingly Democratic district‚Äìwith more than 52% of the vote, and usually faced multiple challengers. For the 1992 election, redistricting pushed his district further into Chicago's south suburbs, territory that Savage did not know and that did not know him. He faced a rematch with Mel Reynolds, who had challenged him in the 1988 and 1990 primaries. Savage claimed that \\"racist Jews\\" were donating to Reynolds, while Reynolds claimed that Savage was involved in a drive-by shooting that injured him. Although Savage accused Reynolds of staging the shooting, he lost the 1992 election to Reynolds by a margin of 63%-37% after voters in the suburban portion of the district voted overwhelmingly for Reynolds. In one of his final acts as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, excavation and construction at the site of the African Burial Ground in New York City was temporarily halted in 1992, pending further evaluation by the General Services Administration, after Savage was able to leverage his reputation as a national political figure to bring attention to the more controversial aspects of the project. Savage died on October 31, 2015, one day after his 90th birthday, which he celebrated with his closest friends and family. He is survived by his son Thomas Savage, daughter, Dr. Emma Savage, and grandchildren Thomas Savage Jr., Chyella McBride, and Alexandria Savage.

Most shunga are a type of ukiyo-e, usually executed in woodblock print format. While rare, there are extant erotic painted handscrolls which predate ukiyo-e. Translated literally, the Japanese word shunga means picture of spring; \\"spring\\" is a common euphemism for sex. The ukiyo-e movement as a whole sought to express an idealisation of contemporary urban life and appeal to the new ch≈çnin class. Following the aesthetics of everyday life, Edo-period shunga varied widely in its depictions of sexuality. As a subset of ukiyo-e it was enjoyed by all social groups in the Edo period, despite being out of favour with the shogunate. Almost all ukiyo-e artists made shunga at some point in their careers.  History  Shigenobu - Man and woman making love by Yanagawa Shigenobu Shunga was heavily influenced by illustrations in Chinese medicine manuals beginning in the Muromachi era (1336 to 1573). Zhou Fang, a notable Tang-dynasty Chinese painter, is also thought to have been influential. He, like many artists of his time, tended to draw genital organs in an oversized manner, similar to a common shunga topos. While the literal meaning of the word \\"shunga\\" is significant, it is in fact a contraction of shunky≈´-higi-ga (Êò•ÂÆÆÁßòÊàØÁîª), the Japanese pronunciation for Chinese sets of twelve scrolls depicting the twelve sexual acts that the crown prince had to carry out as an expression of yin yang. The Japanese influences of shunga date back to the Heian period (794 to 1185).\\"Heian period\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 2007-04-24. At this point, it was found among the courtier class. Through the medium of narrative handscrolls, sexual scandals from the imperial court or the monasteries were depicted, and the characters tended to be limited to courtiers and monks. The style reached its height in the Edo period (1603 to 1867). Thanks to woodblock printing techniques, the quantity and quality increased dramatically. There were repeated governmental attempts to suppress shunga, the first of which was an edict issued by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1661 banning, among other things, erotic books known as (literally \\"lewdness books\\"). While other genres covered by the edict, such as works criticising daimy≈çs or samurai, were driven underground by this edict, shunga continued to be produced with little difficulty. Torii Kiyonobu I. Woodblock. Shunga. 1703. The Ky≈çh≈ç Reforms, a 1722 edict, was much more strict, banning the production of all new books unless the city commissioner gave permission. After this edict, shunga went underground. However, since for several decades following this edict, publishing guilds saw fit to send their members repeated reminders not to sell erotica, it seems probable that production and sales continued to flourish. Further attempts to prevent the production of shunga were made with the Kansei Reforms under Emperor K≈çkaku in the 1790s. According to Monta Hayakawa and C. Andrew Gerstle, westerners during the nineteenth century were less appreciative of shunga because of its erotic nature. In the journal of Francis Hall, an American businessperson who arrived in Yokohama in 1859, he described shunga as \\"vile pictures executed in the best style Japanese art.\\" Hayakawa stated that Hall was shocked and disgusted when on two separate occasions his Japanese acquaintances and their wives showed him shunga at their homes. Shunga also faced problems in Western museums in the twentieth century; Peter Webb reported that while engaged in research for a 1975 publication, he was initially informed that no relevant material existed in the British Museum, and when finally allowed access to it, he was told that it \\"could not possibly be exhibited to the public\\" and had not been catalogued. In 2014 he revisited the museum, which had an exhibition entirely of shunga \\"proudly displayed\\". The introduction of Western culture and technologies at the beginning of the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), particularly the importation of photo-reproduction techniques, had serious consequences for shunga. For a time, woodblock printing continued to be used, but figures began to appear in prints wearing Western clothing and hairstyles.Munro, Majella. Understanding Shunga, ER Books, 2008, p92, Eventually, shunga could no longer compete with erotic photography, leading to its decline. The art of shunga provided an inspiration for the Sh≈çwa (1926‚Äì1989) and Heisei (1989‚Äì2019) art in Japanese video games, anime and manga known in the Western world as hentai and known formally in Japan as j≈´ hachi kin (adult-only, literally \\"18-restricted\\"). Like shunga, hentai is sexually explicit in its imagery.  Uses  Shunga by Keisai Eisen Shunga was probably enjoyed by both men and women of all classes. Superstitions and customs surrounding shunga suggest as much; in the same way that it was considered a lucky charm against death for a samurai to carry shunga, it was considered a protection against fire in merchant warehouses and the home. From this we can deduce that samurai, chonin, and housewives all owned shunga. All three of these groups would suffer separation from the opposite sex; the samurai lived in barracks for months at a time, and conjugal separation resulted from the sankin-k≈çtai system and the merchants' need to travel to obtain and sell goods. It is therefore argued that this ownership of shunga was not superstitious, but libidinous. Records of women obtaining shunga themselves from booklenders show that they were consumers of it. Though not shunga, it was traditional to present a bride with ukiyo-e depicting scenes from the Tale of Genji. Shunga may have served as sexual guidance for the sons and daughters of wealthy families. The instructional purpose has been questioned since the instructional value of shunga is limited by the impossible positions and lack of description of technique, and there were sexual manuals in circulation that offered clearer guidance, including advice on hygiene. Shunga varied greatly in quality and price. Some were highly elaborate, commissioned by wealthy merchants and daimy≈çs, while some were limited in colour, widely available, and cheap. Empon were available through the lending libraries, or kashi-honya, that travelled in rural areas. This tells us that shunga reached all classes of society‚Äîpeasant, ch≈çnin, samurai and daimy≈çs.  Production  Meiji-period shunga print Shunga were produced between the sixteenth century and the nineteenth century by ukiyo-e artists, since they sold more easily and at a higher price than their ordinary work. Shunga prints were produced and sold either as single sheets or‚Äîmore frequently‚Äîin book form, called enpon. These customarily contained twelve images, a tradition with its roots in Chinese shunkyu higa. Shunga was also produced in hand scroll format, called kakemono-e (Êéõ„ÅëÁâ©Áµµ). This format was also popular, though more expensive as the scrolls had to be individually painted. The quality of shunga art varies, and few ukiyo-e painters remained aloof from the genre. Experienced artists found it to their advantage to concentrate on their production. This led to the appearance of shunga by renowned artists, such as the ukiyo-e painter perhaps best known in the Western world, Hokusai (see The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife). Ukiyo-e artists owed a stable livelihood to such customs, and producing a piece of shunga for a high-ranking client could bring them sufficient funds to live on for about six months. Among others, the world-famous Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama uses his special hand brush painting technique and hanko stamp signature method in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to create modern day shunga art in the same tradition of the past artists like Hokusai. Full-colour printing, or nishiki-e, developed around 1765, but many shunga prints predate this. Prior to this, colour was added to monochrome prints by hand, and from 1744 benizuri-e allowed the production of prints of limited colours. Even after 1765 many shunga prints were produced using older methods. In some cases this was to keep the cost low, but in many cases this was a matter of taste. Shunga produced in Edo tended to be more richly coloured than those produced in Kyoto and Osaka, mainly owing to a difference in aesthetic taste between these regions‚ÄîEdo has a taste for novelty and luxury, while the kamigata region preferred a more muted, understated style. This also translates into a greater amount of background detail in Edo Shunga. After 1722 most artists refrained from signing shunga works. However, between 1761 and 1786 the implementation of printing regulations became more relaxed, and many artists took to concealing their name as a feature of the picture (such as calligraphy on a fan held by a courtesan) or allusions in the work itself (such as Utamaro's empon entitled Utamakura).  Content  In the Edo period in Japan, people were used to seeing the opposite sex naked in communal baths, such as the male sansuke in the upper left corner of this woodcut. Torii Kiyonaga. Edo period shunga sought to express a varied world of contemporary sexual possibilities. Some writers on the subject refer to this as the creation of a world parallel to contemporary urban life, but idealised, eroticised and fantastical. = Characters = By far the majority of shunga depict the sexual relations of the ordinary people, the ch≈çnin, the townsmen, women, merchant class, artisans and farmers. Occasionally there also appear Dutch or Portuguese foreigners. Courtesans also form the subject of many shunga. Utamaro was particularly revered for his depictions of courtesans, which offered an unmatched level of sensitivity and psychological nuance. Tokugawa courtesans could be described as the celebrities of their day, and Edo's pleasure district, Yoshiwara, is often compared to Hollywood. Men saw them as highly eroticised due to their profession, but at the same time unattainable, since only the wealthiest, most cultured men would have any chance of sexual relations with one. Women saw them as distant, glamorous idols, and the fashions for the whole of Japan were inspired by the fashions of the courtesan. For these reasons the fetish of the courtesan appealed to many. Works depicting courtesans have since been criticised for painting an idealised picture of life in the pleasure quarters. It has been argued that they masked the situation of virtual slavery under which sex workers lived. However, Utamaro is just one example of an artist who was sensitive to the inner life of the courtesan, for example showing them wistfully dreaming of escape from Yoshiwara through marriage. Similarly, kabuki actors are often depicted, many of whom worked as gigolos. These carried the same fetish of the sex worker, with the added quality of often being quite young. They are often depicted with samurai. =Stories= Lesbian shunga by Hokusai thumbSpring Pastimes A tryst between a young man and a boy. See Nanshoku. Miyagawa Issh≈ç, c. 1750; Shunga hand scroll (kakemono-e); sumi, color and gofun on silk. Private collection. Both painted handscrolls and illustrated erotic books (empon) often presented an unrelated sequence of sexual tableaux, rather than a structured narrative. A whole variety of possibilities are shown‚Äîmen seduce women, women seduce men; men and women cheat on each other; all ages from virginal teenagers to old married couples; even octopuses were occasionally featured. While most shunga were heterosexual, many depicted male-on-male trysts. Woman-on-woman images were less common but there are extant works depicting this. Masturbation was also depicted. The perception of sexuality differed in Tokugawa Japan from that in the modern Western world, and people were less likely to associate with one particular sexual preference. For this reason the many sexual pairings depicted were a matter of providing as much variety as possible. The backstory to shunga prints can be found in accompanying text or dialogue in the picture itself, and in props in the background. Symbolism also featured widely, such as the use of plum blossoms to represent virginity or tissues to symbolise impending ejaculation. = Clothing = In many of the shunga the characters are fully clothed. This is primarily because nudity was not inherently erotic in Tokugawa Japan ‚Äì people were used to seeing the opposite sex naked in communal baths. It also served an artistic purpose; it helped the reader identify courtesans and foreigners, the prints often contained symbolic meaning, and it drew attention to the parts of the body that were revealed, i.e., the genitalia. = Non- realism = Shunga couples are often shown in nonrealistic positions with exaggerated genitalia. Explanations for this include increased visibility of the sexually explicit content, artistic interest and psychological impact: that is, the genitalia are interpreted as a \\"second face\\", expressing the primal passions that the everyday face is obligated by giri to conceal, and are therefore the same size as the head and placed unnaturally close to it by the awkward positioning.

The science centre, which is Northern Ontario's most popular tourist attraction, consists of two snowflake-shaped buildings on the southwestern shore of Ramsey Lake, just south of the city's downtown core, and a former ice hockey arena which includes the complex's entrance and an IMAX theatre. The snowflake buildings are connected by a rock tunnel, which passes through a billion-year-old geologic fault. This fault line was not known to be under the complex when the site was originally selected, and was discovered only during the construction of the building in the early 1980s. Where the walkway reaches the larger snowflake, the Vale Cavern auditorium is frequently used for temporary exhibits, press conferences, and other gala events by Science North and the wider community. Inside the main building, a 20-metre fin whale skeleton, recovered from Anticosti Island, hangs from the ceiling. The complex also features a boat tour, the William Ramsey, which offers touring cruises of the scenic Ramsey Lake. The Jim Gordon Boardwalk also extends from the facility to the city's Bell Park along the western shore of the lake. The facility was designed by architect Raymond Moriyama, one of the founding partners of Moriyama & Teshima Architects, based in Toronto. An agency of the provincial government of Ontario, Science North is overseen by the provincial Ministry of Culture. Facilities =First level= * IMAX With Laser - Science North has a 3D IMAX with Laser theatre.

Although the route runs north-south, it is signed as east-west to match the posted direction of Interstate 890 (I-890), of which NY 890 is an extension. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Glenville, and its eastern terminus is at an interchange with I-890 in the town of Rotterdam, where NY 890 becomes I-890 and continues east into Downtown Schenectady. The idea of a Rotterdam‚ÄìGlenville connector across the Mohawk River was proposed as early as the 1960s. Parts of the right-of-way of NY 890, including the bridges carrying what is now NY 890 over the ramp leading from NY 890 west to NY 5S, were built as part of I-890's construction in 1973. Construction of the remainder of the route was delayed for decades due to a lack of funds. Work on the highway finally resumed in 1996, and the length of NY 890 was opened to traffic in October 1998. Route description Western terminus of NY 890 at NY 5 NY 890 begins four miles (6 km) from downtown Schenectady at an at-grade intersection with NY 5 in the town of Glenville. The route heads south as a four-lane limited-access highway, passing through a small open area in the otherwise developed town before passing under the Delaware and Hudson Railway. Another brief undeveloped stretch leads to the Mohawk River (Erie Canal), which the highway crosses to reach the town of Rotterdam. On the southern bank, NY 890 encounters the eastern terminus of NY 5S via exit 1A, a modified trumpet interchange built adjacent to a forested area bordering the river. As the roadway crosses over a ramp leading from NY 890 westbound to NY 5S, it makes a turn to the southeast, bringing the highway closer to the banks of the river. NY 890 also widens to six lanes at this point to accommodate the road's upcoming junction with the New York State Thruway. The connection between the Thruway and NY 890 is made via I-890, which begins at Thruway exit 26 and merges with NY 890 at exit 1B, a modified trumpet interchange adjacent to the Thruway junction. NY 890 terminates at the south end of the trumpet interchange, and I-890 continues southeastward on NY 890's right-of-way along the Mohawk River toward downtown Schenectady. History =Origins and cancellation= Plans for a Mohawk River crossing between New York State Thruway exit 26 west of Schenectady and NY 5 in Glenville date as far back as 1967 when the town of Glenville developed a proposal to build a western bypass of the city of Schenectady. The highway, named \\"Alternate Route 50\\" or Route 50W, would run from the Thruway at exit 26, cross the Mohawk River, and ultimately head northeast to a terminus in Saratoga County. The crossing part of the proposal gained traction in 1973 when the final section of I-890 was built to accommodate a northward extension and a future exit with NY 5S near the riverbank. In the meantime, NY 5S was reconfigured to directly connect to the west end of I-890 while Thruway exit 26 was accessed by exiting the highway at modern exit 1B. Most of the groundwork for the northern extension was put in place around this time. The connection with NY 5S utilized the right-of-way of what was intended to be a ramp for the riverside exit with NY 5S. Graded roadbeds were laid out for both directions of the extension up to the south bank of the Mohawk River, and the ground was graded for all of the proposed exit's ramps. A pair of bridges to carry the extension over the westbound ramp to NY 5S were also constructed, but unused at this point. No construction of any kind was present north of the river, even though the state of New York had purchased the road's right-of- way. Work on the highway came to a halt in 1976 when the state cancelled the project to shift funds to other projects, including the construction of bridges carrying NY 5 and Freemans Bridge Road over the Mohawk River in downtown Schenectady. =Revival and construction= The project idled until 1983 when state voters approved \\"Rebuild New York\\", a $1.25 billion bond issue to improve the state's transportation infrastructure. A study of the crossing project began in March 1985 using $800,000 in funds from Rebuild New York and continued through December 1986. The General Contractor was Reicker Construction for the update. L-Tech Coatings, Inc. was the final painting contractor to finish the bridge in December 1986. It was finally completed by March 1988. Even through the preliminary study was complete, the state still lacked the funds needed to construct the road. Projections made in 1986 put the cost of the highway at $20 million. The delay in constructing the highway led to increases in the estimated final price tag, which climbed to $34 million by 1990 and $40 million by 1994. In 1995, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) finally made plans to construct the highway, now projected to cost $52 million as originally designed. A total of $24.1 million had been set aside for the road by this point‚Äî$13.3 million from the federal government and a combined $10.8 million from the state and the New York State Thruway Authority‚Äîleading NYSDOT to consider making changes to the road's design in an effort to cut the project's cost. In 1996, two contracts to construct the Mohawk River bridge and its southern approach were awarded for just $22.5 million. The latter contract, valued at just under $7.5 million, would build ramps and highways on the right-of-ways that had graded and leveled years before, as well as rehabilitate and widen three previously unused bridges, including the two installed along the extension's alignment. Work on the highway began in October 1996, almost 25 years after the completion of I-890 and 40 years since work began on the graded roadbeds on the southern riverbank. Ground was broken on the Mohawk River bridge in May 1997. The highway was completed in October 1998 and opened to traffic at 3 p.m. on October 21, 1998, following a ribbon-cutting ceremony. It was designated as NY 890 at this time, becoming one of several state routes to serve as an extension of a like-numbered Interstate Highway.

Located at , Campbellford lies approximately midway between Toronto and Ottawa. It is situated on both the Trent-Severn Waterway and the Trans Canada Trail. It can be reached from Highway 401 by exiting at Brighton (Exit 509) and going north on County Road 30. It can also be reached from Highway 7 at the Havelock exit going south (also on County Road 30). Campbellford is surrounded by prime agricultural land which is home to many farms. In recent years, some of the town's agricultural sector has diversified into non- traditional areas such as bison farming, rare breeds farming and there are many horse farms in the area. The town has a farmers market that is open two days a week in the summer.  History  Campbellford traces its history back to 1834, when the first homesteaders arrived in the area. Once very wealthy, it is still known today for its many fine Victorian homes. Campbellford became a town in 1906 (Trent Hills Visitor Guide, 2009, p. 13). About 70 years earlier, \\"the British government gave two brothers, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Campbell and Major David Campbell, 1800 acres of land to settle in an area named for the Duke of Northumberland's wife Lady Elizabeth Seymour\\" (Trent Hills Visitors Guide, 2009, p. 13). The Trent River (long before it became a canal) meandered through the Campbell property and, not far from the current town centre, the river was shallow enough for crossing. The river crossing came to be known as \\"Campbell's Ford.\\" In 1876 the Village of Campbellford was created and then became a town in 1906. Its centennial was celebrated in 2006. In 2001, Campbellford, Hastings and Warkworth amalgamated to form the Municipality of Trent Hills.  Notable places and people  The town is home to a brewery (Church-Key Brewing Company), a chocolate factory (Blommer Chocolate Company, previously World's Finest Chocolate Factory), a foam cup factory (Dart Container Corporation), and one of eastern Ontario's few remaining rural cheese factories (Empire Cheese). It is also home to Clarion Boats, a highly specialized wooden boat builder and restoration shop; Eagle Airfield Limited, a builder of airport snow and ice control equipment; and Prototype Research & Development Ltd, which builds replicas of classic cars. Campbellford was the home to \\"Iron Chief Charlie\\" Charles W Mahoney whose small informal summertime gathering in July named Charlie's Indian Day started in 1984 and became a substantial motorcycle gathering and made Charlie somewhat of an icon in Campbellford. Each year, for the past 24 years, the small community of Trent Hills‚ÄîCampbellford has played host to an eclectic gathering of motorcyclists.

Serving a catchment area of 30,000 residents, Campbellford Memorial is the only hospital located between Belleville and Peterborough, which are both approximately 60 kilometres away. It is the cornerstone of a health care campus that includes a family health team, Hillside Family Medicine, which serves over 16,000 patients and is a teaching practice affiliated with the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine; a community mental health centre; and a long term care facility. In the summer, Campbellford's population swells with tourists taking advantage of the local lakes and waterways, trails and camping areas. In the winter, snowmobiling is a popular attraction. The 1.98 km¬≤ Ferris Provincial Park is located on the Trent River a short distance south of Campbellford. To enter the park from the west walking visitors cross the Trent River on the Ranney Gorge Suspension Bridge. Seymour Conservation Area is accessed via County Road 30, 1 km south of Campbellford town limits. Campbellford is a stop on the Trent-Severn Waterway, an important inland water transportation network, and is situated between the Ranney Falls Flight Lock (Locks 11 and 12) and the Campbellford Lock (13) of this system.Angus, James T.

The sagas were probably all written in Iceland, from about the middle of the 13th century to about 1400, although it is possible that some may be of a later date,Einar √ìl. Sveinsson, \\"Fornaldars√∂gur\\", in Kulturhistorisk leksikon for nordisk middelalder fra vikingtid til reformasjonstid, bd. 4 (Copenhagen, 1959) such as Hr√≥lfs saga kraka.The Literary Encyclopedia Description of the sagas In terms of form, fornaldars√∂gur are similar to various other saga-genres, but tend towards fairly linear, episodic narratives. Like sagas in other genres, many quote verse, but in the fornaldars√∂gur that verse is almost invariably in the metre of Eddaic verse (unlike the skaldic verse found in most other saga genres).Margaret Clunies Ross, The Cambridge Introduction to the Old Norse-Icelandic Saga (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 77. The setting is primarily Scandinavia in the time prior to the settlement of Iceland and the conversion of Scandinavia, but occasionally it moves temporarily to more distant and exotic locations or has its characters encounter Christian cultures (one example of both being √ñrvar-Odds saga). There are also very often mythological elements, such as dwarves, elves, giants and magic. In centuries past, they were considered to be reliable historic sources by Scandinavian scholars, but since the 19th century, they have been considered to contain very little historic material.Else Mundal, \\"Sagalitteraturen\\", in Odd Einar Haugen (ed.) Handbok i norr√∏n filologi (Bergen, 2004) The present consensus is that, although some of the sagas contain a small core which is not fiction, or are based on historical characters, the primary function of the legendary sagas was entertainment, and the aim of the sagas has not been to present a historically accurate tale. Recently, however, it has been emphasized that the sagas are useful sources for the culture of 13th and 14th century Iceland, \\"in terms of the light that they can shed on the culture in which they were composed\\" i.e. Iceland in the later Middle Ages. In the words of Margaret Clunies Ross, :The themes, characters and the whole world of the fornaldarsaga lend themselves to interpretation, not as realistic narratives, but rather as subjects dealing with deep and disturbing issues that cannot be approached from the perspective of the mundane world but must rather be enacted in a literary world in which often taboo subjects can be raised and aired, though not necessarily resolved. They may also be treated in a comic or parodic vein.Margaret Clunies Ross, The Cambridge Introduction to the Old Norse-Icelandic Saga (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 80. Some of the sagas are based on distant historic characters, and this is evident in cases where there are corroborating sources, such as Ragnars saga lo√∞br√≥kar, Yngvars saga v√≠√∞f√∂rla and V√∂lsunga saga. In the case of Hervarar saga, it conveys names of historical places in present Ukraine during the period c. 150-450,Pritsak, Omeljan. (1981). The origin of Rus'. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Distributed by Harvard University Press for the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute. p. 214 and the last part of the saga is used as a historic source for Swedish history.e.g. in the article Blot-Sven in Nationalencyklopedin (1990), Larsson, Mats G (2002). G√∂tarnas Riken : Uppt√§cktsf√§rder Till Sveriges Enande. Bokf√∂rlaget Atlantis AB pp. 154, 158, 160 and Lagerquist, Lars O. (1997). Sveriges Regenter, fr√•n forntid till nutid. Norstedts, Stockholm. pp. 26, 42, 44, 45 Indeed, they often contain very old Germanic matter, such as the Hervarar saga and the V√∂lsunga saga which contains poetry about Sigurd that did not find its way into the Poetic Edda and which would otherwise have been lost (see the Great Lacuna). Other sagas deal with heroes such as Ragnar Lodbrok, Hr√≥lf Kraki and Orvar-Odd. In these respects, then, the fornaldars√∂gur overlap in genre and occasionally content with the Kings' sagas. Hjorvard and Hjalmar propose to Ingeborg The Fornaldarsagas have great value for legend research, since they contain motifs and complexes of motifs from many types of legend of which there is otherwise no documentation in Scandinavia prior to the mid-19th century. They are also of great value for scholars studying medieval Scandinavian ballads, particularly the Faroese kv√¶√∞i, which are often based on the same matters. Moreover, they are also very important for the study of Scandinavian and Germanic heroic legends together with Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum which was based on the same heroic poetry and traditions. Philologists have generally held the legendary sagas in less esteem, in terms of their literary value, than the Icelanders' sagas. The content is often less realistic, the characters more two-dimensional, and the sagas often borrow themes from each other, and from folk tales. In these aspects of style and reception, the fornaldars√∂gur tend to overlap with the Chivalric sagas, particularly those composed in medieval Iceland. The legendary sagas have influenced later writers, for instance the Swede Esaias Tegn√©r, who wrote Frithiof's saga, based on the Fri√∞√æj√≥fs saga ins fr≈ìkna. One such saga was even forged in the early modern period: Hjalmars och Hramers saga.G√∂del, Vilhelm, ‚ÄúHjalmars och Hramers saga.

Contemporary Eur Ing engineers are degree-qualified and have gained the highest level of professional competencies through training and monitored professional practice experience. Eur Ing engineers are characterised by their ability to develop appropriate solutions to engineering problems, using new or existing technologies, through innovation, creativity and change. They might develop and apply new technologies, promote advanced designs and design methods, introduce new and more efficient production techniques, marketing and construction concepts, pioneer new engineering services and management methods. The title is pre-nominal, i.e. it is placed before rather than after the name as in the case of a post-nominal title such as that for academic degrees (however, in some European countries, academic degrees are also pre- nominal).  Qualification  The title is granted after successful application to a national member of the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI) which includes representation from many European countries, including much of the European Union. In providing an acceptable common and highly professional standard, the European Engineer requires proven experience and competency in the application of scientific knowledge, level of professional skill, safety and environmental consciousness, sense of responsibility and the ability to communicate within the level of supervision received and given. A minimum total period of seven years formation and practice, consisting of an accredited engineering degree, further advanced training and extensive responsible professional experience, is required by FEANI for the EUR ING title. Recognition of the qualification and title are generally not specifically incorporated into national law. In all cases approval is only after peer review by the appropriate national engineering society. The EU Directive 89/48/EEC generally exempts a bearer from additional examination in the European Union. Names are also placed on the FEANI EUR ING Register maintained by FEANI in addition to national member registers.  Ireland and the UK  In Ireland and the United Kingdom, the Chartered Engineer title (8-12 year qualification process) is a prerequisite requirement for an application for the EUR ING title. In the United Kingdom the Privy Council has approved the use of the title, which can be displayed on a British passport.  France  In France, it is the association Engineers and Scientists of France (IESF) which manages the applications for the attribution of the title of European Engineer (EUR ING) with the European Federation of national associations of engineers (FEANI). A Masters level engineering degree recognised by the state (Bac+5), together with a minimum of five years of experience and training is required for the application of the EUR ING title to FEANI.  Belgium  In Belgium a Master of Engineering degree together with further years of postgraduate experience and training is required for the application of the EUR ING title. This is achieved through the Committee of Belgian Engineers (Comit√© des Ing√©nieurs Belges, CIBIC).  Greece  In Greece a Master of Engineering degree (5-year course leading to a Diploma/Dipl.Ing) from a University together with at least two further years of postgraduate experience and training in relevant roles as an Engineer is required for the application of the EUR ING title. This is achieved through the Technical Chamber of Greece (Œ§ŒµœáŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒïœÄŒπŒºŒµŒªŒ∑œÑŒÆœÅŒπŒø ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ, Œ§ŒïŒï) after an application and examination of all required specifications. https://web.tee.gr/int-news/titlos-eur-ing/ FEANI also requests that the School of Engineering be accredited by a EUR-ACE Seal of Excellence. In the French-speaking part of Belgium (Wallonia) it is the responsibility of AEQES, the agency for the Evaluation of the Quality of Higher Education of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation (also known as the \\"French Community of Belgium\\") to request and obtain this European reference certification.

During a limited release in 1993, it opened on 12 screens. The film follows the adventures of an amateur inventor who goes through time with his female accomplice to stop an evil megacorporation intent on changing history for profit. The film was lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1997 and by Rifftrax in a live event broadcast on May 5, 2016. Plot Physics teacher and amateur pilot Nick Miller (Matthew Bruch) has finally completed his quest of enabling time travel, via a Commodore 64 and his small airplane. After being inspired by a television commercial for GenCorp, he uses a ruse to bring out both a GenCorp executive and a reporter from a local paper. To Nick's surprise, the reporter is Lisa Hansen (Bonnie Pritchard), an old high school flame. One trip to 2041 later and Gencorp's executive, Matthew Paul (Peter Harrington), quickly arranges Nick a meeting with CEO J.K. Robertson (George Woodard). Impressed by the potential of time travel, Robertson offers Nick a licensing agreement on the technology. The following week, Nick and Lisa meet at the supermarket and go on a date to the 1950s. However, another trip to 2041 reveals that GenCorp abused Nick's time travel technology, creating a dystopian future. In an attempt to tell J.K. about how GenCorp inadvertently ruined the future. J.K. dismisses the eventuality, and states that there's enough time to worry about how to fix it before it happens. J.K. sees Nick as a threat to GenCorp, and due to the association with the U.S. Government, considers Nick's actions as treason. Nick and Lisa escape GenCorp and spend the remainder of the film trying to reverse the damage to the future. When J.K. finds out about this, he and Matt try to shoot down Nick's plane, killing Lisa in the process while Nick jumps out before the plane crashes. This ultimately culminates in a fight in 1777 during the American Revolution, the deaths of the present Nick and Robertson, and the destruction of the time machine before the original demo, thus ensuring that the majority of the film's events never happen in the first place. The film ends with the now current Nick (now aware of the danger of his time machine) sabotaging his demonstration, and doing a pitch of how an elderly skydiver would be a better ad campaign for J.K.'s company. Furious about being misled, J.K. fires Matt. Nick deletes the eight 5¬º\\" floppy disks that make time travel possible. At the end of the film, Nick talks to Lisa in the supermarket as he did in the previous timeline.

Robertson * Jason Smiley as Future Inhabitant * Cyrus Rodgers as Future Inhabitant  Production  Scenes from Time Chasers were shot at Martin's Foods in South Burlington, Vermont. The production was shot in the Rutland, Vermont area during the summer of 1990, though it has a distinctive assortment of mid-1980s cultural artifacts, sets, and props. It was made on a $150,000 budget by 24 year old director David Giancola and his company Edgewood Studios. Some sources claim that the GenCorp executive's desk is actually at the top of the stairs at Castleton State College near Rutland, but other sources claim it was filmed at the Rutland Opera House; director David Giancola says that \\"it was a combination of both the offices and studios of radio station WJJR 98.1 and The Howard Bank.\\" When heckling it, the MST3K crew lampooned it as being in a public library and featuring a \\"giant circus mirror.\\" The grocery store scene was shot inside Martins, an actual grocery chain which eventually rebranded and has since moved its Rutland location (twice). The former Martins site (formerly the Rutland Mall) is now where Big Lots exists, inside the Home Depot complex. The exteriors were of the local power utility, VELCO.\\" Scenes of the dystopic future were filmed at the Howe Center which Giancola's family was then renovating. A few scenes were shot in the Burlington area; the undisturbed future were shot by the Papa Gino's in what was then the Burlington Square Mall and the 1950s diner was Libby's Blue Line Diner (now Athens Diner) by I-89 Exit 16. In 2004, when asked if he was considering a sequel, Giancola said: \\"We don't have any plans for a sequel, there have been so many time travel films since covering the same material, I don't feel I have anything new to add.\\" DVD release In 2008, a new \\"Special Anniversary Edition\\" of the film was released with deleted scenes, new audio commentary and in depth humorous interviews, including \\"Memories In Time\\" by filmmaker Andrew Gannon. MST3K appearance The film initially lost money, but licensing fees for its 1997 Mystery Science Theater 3000 appearance took its earnings out of the red. The lead, Matthew Bruch, was also the Stunt Coordinator. There are a few of Giancola's relatives who also worked on the film, two of whom were Executive Producers of the film. For the showing on MST3K, the cast and crew had a reunion party to view the lampooning. MST3K star Michael J. Nelson claims that some at the party were not happy at the mocking, in particular Peter Harrington. Director Giancola said they all \\"laughed their asses off,\\" but also admitted that some people at the time \\"took it a bit too seriously.\\" A stray comment on the MST3K version led to this film incorrectly appearing on the IMDB profile for Lisa Kudrow for a number of years. The role of \\"worshipful one\\" is actually played by Vicky A. Bourn, in her one and only film role.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995. He resigned in October 1995 after a jury convicted him of sexual assault charges related to sex with an underage campaign worker. Early life Reynolds and his twin brother, Marvin Jerry Reynolds, were born in Mound Bayou, Mississippi to Reverend J. J. Reynolds and Essie Mae Prather. Reynolds moved to Chicago as a child. He received an Associate of Arts from one of the City Colleges of Chicago, and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and from Harvard University with a M.P.A.. He also won a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he attended Lincoln College and received an LL.B.. Before entering politics, Reynolds worked as an assistant professor of political science at Roosevelt University in Chicago, Illinois. He also founded the Community Economic Development and Education Foundation. Political career Reynolds ran three times from 1988 to 1992 in Democratic Party elections for the 2nd District against incumbent Gus Savage, who was known for racially incendiary and anti-Semitic remarks that drew criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. In 1988, Reynolds finished third with only 14% of the vote with multiple candidates running. In 1990, Reynolds lost, but ran much closer after Savage's conduct was criticized by the House Ethics Committee in connection with a sex scandal. In 1992, redistricting pushed the 2nd further into Chicago's suburbs. Suburban voters were turned off by Savage's rhetoric and supported Reynolds in the primary, giving him a two-to-one margin in the primary‚Äìthe real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. He easily won the general election in November. In Congress, he was granted a seat on the Ways and Means Committee, the first freshman to serve on this committee in 14 years. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement and introduced legislation on gun control. Convictions and resignation In August 1994, Reynolds was indicted for sexual assault and criminal sexual abuse for engaging in a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer that began during the 1992 campaign. He also faced charges of child pornography for asking the underage campaign worker to obtain \\"lewd photographs of another girl who was age 15\\" and obstruction of justice for convincing one of the girls involved to lie to authorities. Despite the charges, he continued his campaign and was reelected in November without opposition. Reynolds initially denied the charges, which he claimed were racially motivated. On August 22, 1995, he was convicted on 12 counts of criminal sexual assault, sexual abuse, obstruction of justice and solicitation of child pornography. He resigned his seat on October 1 of that year. Had he attempted to stay in office, his role in Congress would have been very limited, as longstanding House rules state that a member convicted of a felony should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the House Ethics Committee reviews the matter. Reynolds was sentenced to five years in federal prison and was expected to be released in 1998. Bank Fraud However, in April 1997 he was convicted on 16 new counts of bank fraud, misusing campaign funds for personal use, and lying to FEC investigators. Specifically, one count of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud, eight counts of making false statements on loan applications, one count of conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission, and four counts of making false statements to the FEC. These charges resulted in an additional sentence of 78 months in federal prison, to run consecutively with his 1995 sentence. Reynolds served all of his first sentence, and served 42 months in prison for the later charges. President Bill Clinton then commuted his sentence for bank fraud and Reynolds was released from prison. He served the remaining time in a halfway house. Later career In January 2001, Reynolds was hired by Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition to decrease the number of young African-Americans going to prison. In 2004, Reynolds sought to win back his old House seat, but was overwhelmingly defeated in the Democratic primary by the man who had succeeded him, Jesse Jackson, Jr., with Jackson netting 88% of the vote. Reynolds sought the seat again, running in the 2013 special election to replace Jackson after Jackson retired. He came in 7th place in the Democratic primary. Later legal troubles On February 18, 2014, Reynolds was arrested in Zimbabwe for overstaying his visa. He was allegedly found to be in possession of pornographic videos he had filmed with several women at the hotel where he was staying. Possession of pornography is a crime in the country. He had also purportedly accrued over $24,000 in hotel charges that he had yet to pay. The pornography charges were later dropped, but he pleaded guilty to violating immigration laws, and was deported to South Africa. He claimed in early March 2014 to be hiding there from Zimbabwean death squads, who he claimed were targeting him because he possessed information about American companies from Chicago doing business illegally in Zimbabwe. On June 26, 2015, Reynolds was indicted by a grand jury for failure to file federal income tax returns for the 2009 through 2012 tax years on more than $400,000 income. The next month he missed his arraignment, because he claimed he could not return to the U.S. due to issues with his daughter's health. It was not clear where Reynolds was, although he had previously hidden in South Africa out of fear for his life. In April 2016, Reynolds was sentenced to two months of prison for two bond violations in his tax case and his trial was scheduled for September; Reynolds decided to represent himself in court. Reynolds claims the majority of the income the government claimed should be filed on income tax returns was given by Elzie Higginbottom, the key witness for the trial on misdemeanor tax charges, to him in order to travel to South Africa to set up opportunities in real estate and the diamond industry. On September 28, 2017, Judge Robert Gettleman found Reynolds guilty on tax charges, on all four counts alleging he failed to file a federal income tax return for four consecutive years. He was sentenced by Gettleman to six months in prison on May 10, 2018 which he begun serving at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago on August 1. At a press conference after the sentencing, Reynolds stated he planned to move to South Africa with his daughter after his release.

The ship was to have been the first -long ocean liner. She was intended to be the largest ocean liner for the White Star Line, thus she would have been larger than the earlier White Star giants  History  Several sets of plans for the ship's design were produced by Harland and Wolff for Oceanic between 1926 and 1930. One set, submitted in January 1926, showed a -long four-funnel liner. Another set, drawn later the same year, showed a 935 feet long and 100 feet wide liner with three funnels. It was roughly the same size as Europa and Bremen. The final set showed the current design with three funnels and cruiser stern typical of liners being built in the mid to late 1920s. Digital drawing of the RMMV Oceanic The order was placed on 18 June 1928 and construction began on 28 June 1928, when her keel was laid. The work was slowed by a dispute over her powerplant; Lord Kylsant who controlled the White Star Line wanted to use diesel-electric instead of the traditional steam power. White Star proposed having over 40 diesel generator sets driving four propellers through geared electric motors. Harland & Wolff was reluctant to adopt this system, preferring to continue the use of trusted steam turbine propulsion. A compromise of sorts was reached and the final design used four conventional low-speed 'cathedral' diesel engines, each directly driving one propeller shaft - which would have made Oceanic the first quadruple-screw Motor ship. But by the time all parties had settled on the use of diesel, the Great Depression was hitting the shipping business.  Cancellation  MV Georgic inherited several of the designs planned for the Oceanic and her construction began after the cancellation of this shipleft Further work on Oceanic was postponed, and later cancelled due to the collapse of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, owners of the White Star Line, as a result of the financial problems of Sir Owen Philips, Lord Kylsant. The Royal Mail Case, as it was known, led to the imprisonment of Kylsant, and to substantial changes in accounting and auditing practice. Loans backed by the governments of England and Northern Ireland intended for the construction of Oceanic were diverted to the construction of the last two ships built for White Star, Britannic and her near twin sister, Georgic. These two liners may have been built with steel plate ordered for Oceanic, whose partially built hull was subsequently dismantled and recycled after the aforementioned diversion of funds. Based on the third set design drawn by Harland and Wolff, the ship would have measured at least 1000 feet long with a tonnage of 80,000 tons and have three squat funnels, making her appear like a larger version of Georgic and roughly the same size as her rivals and , along with powerful engines which would potentially have enabled the ship to gain the Blue Riband record for speed. Her extensive interiors were to have been, to a large degree, based on the popular Art Deco fashions of the day pioneered on ocean liners by the French Line's just a few years earlier in 1927.

They serve two purposes: to inflect adjectives and verbs, and to force a particular kanji to have a specific meaning and be read a certain way. For example, the plain verb form (miru, \\"see\\") inflects to past tense (mita, \\"saw\\"), where is the kanji stem, and „Çã and „Åü are okurigana, written in hiragana script. With very few exceptions,Examples of exceptions are the verbs , and . okurigana are only used for kun'yomi (native Japanese readings), not for on'yomi (Chinese readings), as Chinese morphemes do not inflect in Japanese,Verbs with Chinese roots are instead formed by appending (suru, to do), or occasionally variant forms such as (jiru), and only the , which is a separate word, inflects. and their pronunciation is inferred from context, since many are used as parts of compound words (kango). When used to inflect an adjective or verb, okurigana can indicate aspect (perfective versus imperfective), affirmative or negative meaning, or grammatical politeness, among many other functions. In modern usage, okurigana are almost invariably written with hiragana; katakana were also commonly used in the past.  English analogs  Analogous orthographic conventions find occasional use in English, which, being more familiar, help in understanding okurigana. As an inflection example, when writing Xing for cross-ing, as in Ped Xing (pedestrian crossing), the -ing is a verb suffix, while cross is the dictionary form of the verb ‚Äì in this case cross is the reading of the character X, while -ing is analogous to okurigana. By contrast, in the noun Xmas for Christmas, the character Œß is instead read as Christ (it is actually a chi in origin, from the Greek ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ, Khrist√≥s). The suffixes serve as phonetic complements to indicate which reading to use. Another common example is in ordinal and cardinal numbers ‚Äì \\"1\\" is read as one, while \\"1st\\" is read as fir-st. Note that word, morpheme (constituent part of word), and reading may be distinct: in \\"1\\", \\"one\\" is at once the word, the morpheme, and the reading, while in \\"1st\\", the word and the morpheme are \\"first\\", while the reading is fir, as the -st is written separately, and in \\"Xmas\\" the word is \\"Christmas\\" while the morphemes are Christ and -mas, and the reading \\"Christ\\" coincides with the first morpheme. Inflection examples Adjectives in Japanese use okurigana to indicate aspect and affirmation-negation, with all adjectives using the same pattern of suffixes for each case. A simple example uses the character (high) to express the four basic cases of a Japanese adjective. The root meaning of the word is expressed via the kanji (, read taka and meaning \\"high\\" in each of these cases), but crucial information (aspect and negation) can only be understood by reading the okurigana following the kanji stem. ; (takai) : High (positive, imperfective), meaning \\"[It is] expensive\\" or \\"[It is] high\\" ; (takakunai) : High (negative, imperfective), meaning \\"[It is] not expensive/high\\" ; (takakatta) : High (positive, perfective), meaning \\"[It was] expensive/high\\" ; (takakunakatta) : High (negative, perfective), meaning \\"[It was not] expensive/high\\" Japanese verbs follow a similar pattern; the root meaning is generally expressed by using one or more kanji at the start of the word, with aspect, negation, grammatical politeness, and other language features expressed by following okurigana. ; (taberu) : Eat (positive, imperfective, direct politeness), meaning \\"[I/you/etc.] eat\\" ; (tabenai) : Eat (negative, imperfective, direct), meaning \\"[I/you/etc.] do not eat\\" ; (tabeta) : Eat (positive, perfective, direct), meaning \\"[I/you/etc.] ate/have eaten\\" ; (tabenakatta) : Eat (negative, perfective, direct), meaning \\"[I/you/etc.] did not eat/have not eaten\\" Compare the direct polite verb forms to their distant forms, which follow a similar pattern, but whose meaning indicates more distance between the speaker and the listener: ; (tabemasu) : Eat (positive, imperfective, distant politeness), meaning \\"[My group/your group] eats\\" ; (tabemasen) : Eat (negative, imperfective, distant), meaning \\"[My group/your group] does not eat\\" ; (tabemashita) : Eat (positive, perfective, distant), meaning \\"[My group/your group] ate/has eaten\\" ; (tabemasen deshita) : Eat (negative, perfective, distant), meaning \\"[My group/your group] did not eat/has not eaten\\" Disambiguation of kanji Okurigana are also used as phonetic complements to disambiguate kanji that have multiple readings, and consequently multiple meanings. Since kanji, especially the most common ones, can be used for words with many (usually similar) meanings ‚Äî but different pronunciations ‚Äî key okurigana placed after the kanji help the reader to know which meaning and reading were intended. Both individual kanji and multi-kanji words may have multiple readings, and okurigana are used in both cases. Okurigana for disambiguation are a partial gloss, and are required: for example, in , the stem is (and does not vary under inflection), and is pronounced (kudasa) ‚Äì thus corresponds to the reading „Åè„Å† (kuda), followed by (sa), which is written here kuda-sa. Note the okurigana are not considered part of the reading; grammatically the verb is kudasa-ru (verb stem + inflectional suffix), but orthographically the stem itself is analyzed as kuda-sa (kanji reading + okurigana). Compare with furigana, which specify the reading of the kanji, appear outside the line of the text, and which are omitted if understood. Disambiguation examples include common verbs which use the characters (up) and (down): ; (a) : (a-garu) \\"to ascend/to make ready/to complete\\", and (a-geru) \\"to raise, to give (upwards)\\" ; (nobo) : (nobo-ru) \\"to go up/to climb (a set of stairs)\\", and (nobo-su) \\"serve food, raise a matter (uncommon)\\" Do not confuse with its homophone, (both pronounced \\"noboru\\"). One meaning of is \\"to climb (especially with hands and feet)\\". ; (kuda) : (kuda- saru) \\"to give [to the speaker from a superior]\\", and (kuda-ru) \\"to be handed down [intransitive]\\" ; (o) : (o-riru) \\"to get off/to descend\\" and (o-rosu) \\"to let off (transitive)\\" ; (sa) : (sa-garu) \\"to dangle (intransitive)\\", and (sa- geru) \\"to hang, to lower (transitive)\\" Observe that many Japanese verbs come in transitive/intransitive pairs, as illustrated above, and that a single kanji reading is shared between the two verbs, with sufficient okurigana written to reflect changed endings. The above okurigana are as short as possible, given this restriction ‚Äì note for instance that (noboru) / (nobosu) are written as / , not as or , while must be written as to share a kanji reading with . Another example includes a common verb with different meanings based on the okurigana: ; (hana-su) : \\"to speak/to talk\\". Example: (chanto hanasu h≈ç ga ii), meaning \\"It's better if you speak correctly.\\" ; (hana-shi) : noun form of the verb hanasu, \\"to speak\\". Example: (hanashi kotoba to kaki kotoba), meaning \\"spoken words and written words\\". ; (hanashi) : noun, meaning \\"a story\\" or \\"a talk\\". Example: (hanashi wa ikaga?), meaning \\"How about a story?\\" Okurigana are not always sufficient to specify the reading. For example, (to become angry) can be read as (ika-ru) or (oko-ru) ‚Äì and are not usedCompare (, o-koru, o-kosu), which does use . ‚Äì (to open) may be read either as (a-ku) or as (hira-ku) ‚Äì is not used ‚Äì and may be read either as (to-meru) or as (ya-meru) ‚Äì is not used. is sometimes used for (, to-maru), the intransitive version of (, to-meru), however. In such cases the reading must be deduced from context or via furigana. Ambiguity may be introduced in inflection ‚Äì even if okurigana specify the reading in the base (dictionary) form of a verb, the inflected form may obscure it. For example, i-ku \\"go\\" and okona-u \\"perform, carry out\\" are distinct in dictionary form, but in past (\\"perfective\\") form become i-tta \\"went\\" and okona-tta \\"performed, carried out\\" ‚Äì which reading to use must be deduced from context or furigana.In this example, the non-standard okurigana oko-nau is sometimes used for clarity. = = One of the most complex examples of okurigana is the kanji , pronounced sh≈ç or sei in borrowed Chinese vocabulary, which stands for several native Japanese words as well: * nama 'raw' or ki 'pure/unprocessed' * o-u 'grow/spring up' * i-kiru 'live' * i-kasu 'make use of (experience, skills)' * i-keru 'arrange (flowers)' * u-mu 'bear (child)/produce' * u-mareru/uma-reru 'be born' * ha-eru 'grow' (intransitive) * ha-yasu 'grow' (transitive) as well as the hybrid Chinese-Japanese words * sh≈ç-jiru 'occur', which is a modification of * sh≈ç-zuru (single character + ) Note that some of these verbs share a kanji reading (i, u, and ha), and okurigana are conventionally picked to maximize these sharings. = Multi-character words = Okurigana may also be used in multi-kanji words, where the okurigana specifies the pronunciation of the entire word, not simply the character that they follow; these distinguish multi-kanji native words from kango (borrowed Chinese words) with the same characters. Examples include nouns such as kikubari \\"care, consideration\\" versus kehai \\"indication, hint, sign\\" (note that the reading of changes between ki and ke, despite it not having an okurigana of its own), and verbs, such as hayaru \\"be popular, be fashionable\\", versus ry≈´k≈ç \\"fashion\\". Note that in this later case, the native verb and the borrowed Chinese word with the same kanji have approximately the same meaning, but are pronounced differently. Okurigana can also occur in the middle of a compound, such as ochiba \\"fallen leaves\\" and rakuy≈ç \\"fallen leaves, defoliation\\" ‚Äì note that the reading of the terminal changes between ba and y≈ç despite it occurring after the okurigana. = Historical suffixes = For a few categories of words, okurigana correspond to historical suffixes which are no longer distinct or productive, and the suffix is now fused to the word, but still written in hiragana. This is particularly the case for words which function as adjectives, with notable categories including: * -shii adjectives, such as ure-shii \\"happy\\" * -yaka na adjectives, such as nigi-yaka(na) \\"bustling, busy\\" * -raka na adjectives, such as aki-raka(na) \\"clear, obvious\\" * -taru adjectives, such as d≈çd≈ç-taru \\"magnificent, stately\\" * -naru adjectives, such as tan-naru \\"mere, simple\\" Note that only the -i in -shii inflects; the other kana are invariant, and in practice serve only for disambiguation and to reflect historical grammar. Briefly, -shii adjectives used to be a different class from -i adjectives (distinguished historically as -ku and -shiku adjectives, for present -i and -shii), but have since merged; -yaka and -raka used to be suffixes, but are no longer productive, while -taru and -naru are historical variants of what is now the adjective particle -na. See Japanese equivalents of adjectives for details. Informal rules =Verbs= The okurigana for group I verbs ( godan d≈çshi, also known as u-verbs) usually begin with the final mora of the dictionary form of the verb. : no-mu to drink, itada-ku to receive, yashina-u to cultivate, ne-ru to twist For group II verbs ( ichidan d≈çshi, also known as ru-verbs) the okurigana begin at the mora preceding the last, unless the word is only two morae long. : samata-geru to prevent, ta-beru to eat, shi-meru to comprise, ne-ru to sleep, ki-ru to wear If the verb has different variations, such as transitive and intransitive forms, then the different morae are written in kana, while the common part constitutes a single common kanji reading for all related words. : shi-meru to close (transitive), shi-maru to close (intransitive) ‚Äì in both cases the reading of is shi. : o-chiru to fall, o-tosu to drop ‚Äì in both cases the reading of is o. In other cases (different verbs with similar meanings, but which are not strictly variants of each other), the kanji will have different readings, and the okurigana thus also indicate which reading to use. : obiya- kasu to threaten (mentally), odo-su to threaten (physically) =Adjectives= Most adjectives ending in -i (true adjectives) have okurigana starting from the -i. : yasu-i, taka-i, aka-i Okurigana starts from shi for adjectives ending in -shii (this reflects historical grammar; see above). : tano-shii, ichijiru-shii, mazu-shii Exceptions occur when the adjective also has a related verbal form. In this case, as with related verbs (above), the reading of the character is kept constant, and the okurigana are exactly the morae that differ. : atata-meru (verb), atata-kai (adjective) ‚Äì in both cases is read atata. : tano-mu (verb), tano-moshii (adjective) ‚Äì in both cases is read tano. As with verbs, okurigana is also used to distinguish between readings (unrelated adjectives with the same kanji), in which case the okurigana indicate which reading to use. : hoso-i, koma-kai; ≈ç-ini, ≈ç-kii Na-adjectives (adjectival verbs) that end in -ka have okurigana from the ka. : shizu-ka, tashi-ka, yuta-ka, oro-ka =Adverbs= The last mora of an adverb is usually written as okurigana. : sude-ni, kanara-zu, suko-shi Note that such adverbs are often written in kana, such as matta-ku and moppa-ra . =Nouns= Nouns do not normally have okurigana. : tsuki, sakana, kome In some cases the reading is then ambiguous, and must be deduced from context or by furigana. : nama or ki : tetsu or kurogane (tetsu is usual) However, if the noun is derived from a verb or adjective, it may take the same okurigana, although some may be omitted in certain cases (see below). The derivation may not be apparent if it is old and the verb is no longer in use (see below). : a-tari (from a-taru), ika-ri (from ika-ru), tsu-ri (from tsu-ru), kiza-shi (from kiza-su) For some nouns it is obligatory to omit the okurigana, despite having a verbal origin. : hanashi (from hana-su), k≈çri (from k≈ç-ru) , tatami (from tata-mu) In these cases, the noun form of the corresponding verb does take okurigana. : hana-shi is the nominal form of the verb hana-su, and not the noun hanashi. Formally, the verbal noun (VN, still retaining verbal characteristics) takes okurigana, as is usual for verbs, while the deverbal noun (DVN, without verbal characteristics) does not take okurigana, as is usual for nouns. To understand this grammatical distinction, compare the English present participle (verb form ending in -ing, indicating continuous aspect) and the gerund (noun form of the -ing verb form, which is a verbal noun) versus deverbal forms (which are irregular):Alternatively, compare \\"converse\\" (verb) with \\"conversation\\" (verbal noun, act of conversing) with \\"conversation\\" (deverbal noun, episode noun ‚Äì the time period), which corresponds with Japanese . :\\"I am learning Japanese\\" (verb) and \\"Learning is fun\\" (verbal noun) versus the deverbal \\"Alexandria was a center of learning\\" (here \\"learning\\" is being used as synonymous with \\"knowledge\\", rather than an activity) Similarly, some nouns are derived from verbs, but written with different kanji, in which case no okurigana are used. : hori moat, from hori (nominal form of horu to dig) In other cases a kanji may be derived from another verb or verb combination and retain the okurigana: : shiawa-se from shi-awa-se Some okurigana come from Old Japanese, and the underlying verb is no longer in use. : saiwa-i from earlier saihahi : ikio-i from ikio-fu (compare sei) Note that these -i suffixes are not i-adjectives ‚Äì they are the ends of verb stems. =Compounds= In compounds, okurigana may be omitted if there is no ambiguity in meaning or reading ‚Äì in other words, if that compound is only read a single way. If okurigana occur after several characters (esp. both in the middle of the compound and at the end of the compound, as in 2-character compounds), either only the middle okurigana, or both the middle and the final okurigana may be omitted; omitting only the final okurigana but retaining the middle okurigana is rather unusual and somewhat questionable, though not unknown (marked with ‚Äú?‚Äù below). : u-ke tsu-ke, uke tsu-ke, ?u-ke tsuke, uke tsuke : i-ki saki, iki saki This is particularly done for Japanese compound verbs (the okurigana inflection of the first, main verb is dropped), as above. This is especially common in reducing or removing kana in formulaic constructions, particularly in signs. For example, in the common phrase (tachi-iri kin-shi, Do not enter; literally, entry prohibited) in analyzed as , but the okurigana are usually dropped. If the compound is unfamiliar to the reader, there is the risk of it being incorrectly read with on readings, rather than the kun readings ‚Äì for example, \\"drive-in forbidden\\" is read nori- ire-kin-shi () ‚Äì the first two characters are a compound verb ‚Äì but an unfamiliar reader may guess j≈çny≈´-kinshi based on the on readings. However, this is not a problem with familiar compounds, whose reading is already known. Okurigana are avoided in compounds where the reading cannot easily be analyzed into readings of the individual characters, as these are confusing ‚Äì the reading simply must be learnt separately. These include especially ateji and gikun, as well as cases where a compound word has changed pronunciation over the years, and is no longer a simple combination of the compounds. For example, i-buki \\"breath\\" is specifically prescribed to not have okurigana ‚Äì there is the related verb i-bu-ku \\"to breathe\\", which must have okurigana for inflection, but is otherwise pronounced iki, so there is the risk of misreading as *iki-buki. This is formalized for the words in the addendum to the J≈çy≈ç list in the second category of exceptions, listed below. =Exceptions= The above rules are guidelines, and there are exceptions and special cases that must be learnt individually: okurigana that has become standard for historical reasons (now obscure or not obvious at a glance) or by convention rather than logic. Compare for instance: : aka-rui ‚Äì rather than akaru-i : a-kari ( aka-ri also acceptable) These both originally derived from the verb aka-ru, which is no longer in use; the first is an irregularly derived i-adjective, while the latter is a deverbal noun. Compare a-ku and ak _i_ -raka.  Formal rules  The Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT) prescribes rules on how to use okurigana, giving standardized Japanese orthography. The original notification (see references) is from 1973, but it was amended in 1981 when the j≈çy≈ç kanji table was issued. The rules apply to kun'yomi (native Japanese readings) of kanji in the j≈çy≈ç kanji table; they do not apply to kanji outside the j≈çy≈ç kanji table, or kanji without kun'yomi (with only on'yomi, Chinese readings). The notification gives 7 general rules () and 2 rules for difficult cases () in the j≈çy≈ç kanji table's word list attachment (). The first 2 rules (1 & 2) address words that conjugate, the next 3 rules (3‚Äì5) address words that do not conjugate, and the last 2 rules (6 & 7) address compound words. Whenever there's doubt whether something is permissible use () or not, the general rule () is to be followed. In some cases, variations are permitted, when there is no danger of confusion; in other case, when there is danger of confusion, variations are not permitted. Scope: * The notification provides the basis for okurigana usage in laws, official documents, newspapers, magazines, broadcasts, and similar places where modern Japanese is written using the readings given in the j≈çy≈ç kanji table. * The notification does not attempt to regulate the use of okurigana in science, technology, art, and other special fields or in writing of individuals. * The notification does not apply to proper nouns or kanji used as symbols. * Okurigana is not used for on readings, and they are not mentioned in the rules except where necessary.

These refer to prescribed spellings of words on the attachment to the J≈çy≈ç kanji list. Required or recommended (acceptable alternatives in parentheses) ():    * Forbidden (): * i-buki * sa- jiki * shigure * tsuki-yama (avoid confusion with kizu-ki) * na-gori (avoid confusion with noko-ri) * nadare (avoid confusion with kuzu-re) * fubuki * mai-go (avoid confusion with mayo-i) * yuku-e  Issues  = Variation = While MEXT prescribes rules and permitted variations, in practice there is much variation ‚Äì permitted or not ‚Äì particularly in older texts (prior to guidelines) and online ‚Äì note that these rules are not prescriptive for personal writings, but only in official documents and media. As an example, the standard spelling of the word kuregata is , but it will sometimes be seen as . = Sound change = While okurigana are sufficient to show inflection of adjectives and verbs, in rare cases further sound change occurs that affects the stem, and must be inferred from the okurigana, without being explicitly written. An everyday example is , where the stem would normally be pronounced , as this comes from the i-adjective ‚Äì the a ‚Üí o sound change must be inferred from the following -u. This sound change is due to this being a polite adjective form. If there is additional non-inflectional okurigana, then these are change, and this is sufficient to show the sound change in the spelling. This occurs for adjectives ending in -shii, like , hence . A basic example other than -shii of such okurigana use is , from . = Confusion with compounds = There is a risk of confusion of okurigana with compounds: some Japanese words are traditionally written with kanji, but today some of these kanji are hy≈çgaiji (uncommon characters), and hence are often written as a mixture of kanji and kana, the uncommon characters being replaced by kana; this is known as mazegaki. The resulting orthography is seen by some as confusing and unsightly, particularly if it is the second character that is written in kana ‚Äì the kana characters are where okurigana would be expected to go ‚Äì and this is one motivation for expansions of kanji lists. For example, until the 2010 expansion of the j≈çy≈ç kanji, the word kanpeki (perfect) was officially written , not as the compound , since the character was not on the official list,Japan Times, Get set for next year's overhaul of official kanji, 21 October 2009, retrieved 27 February 2010. and takarakuji (lottery) is officially (and also popularly) written as , not as , since the second character is not in the j≈çy≈ç kanji and is also quite complicated. This is less of an issue when the first kanji is written in kana, as in (yashi-kaku, coconut shell), which is formally . = Unwritten particles = Converse to okurigana, where part of the pronunciation of a word is written after the kanji, in some cases following kana is dropped (or included in the reading of the previous character). This is primarily for the attributive particles -no (sometimes written in katakana as ) and -ga (sometimes written or ), and is most common in names. For example, the common family name Inoue (I-no-ue Well‚Äôs top, top of well) is generally written , though if the particle were written it would be . Similarly, Amagasaki (Ama-ga-saki, Nun‚Äôs peak) is generally written , but can be written , and Sen no Riky≈´ is written (here the particle is between the family and given name). This can sometimes cause ambiguity, as in the Yamanote Line (for a time called the Yamate Line) and the Agatsuma Line (which could be read as Azuma). Particles are considered grammatically separate from the attached word (they are not an inflection), and this is not considered okurigana, despite some superficial similarities. = Other affixes = Japanese has various affixes, some of which are written in kana and should not be confused with okurigana. Most common are the honorifics, which are generally suffixes, such as -san (Mr., Ms.), and bikago (, \\"beautified language\\"), such as and as in (ocha, tea).

It is the anniversary of the formal transfer of the Territory of Alaska from Russia to the United States, which occurred on Friday, October 18, 1867. Background On March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2 million. It was not until October of that year that the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 United States Army troops, who marched to the governor's house at \\"Castle Hill\\". Here the Russian soldiers lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised.William S. Hanable (April 4, 1975) , National Park Service and The official account of the affair as presented by General Lovell Rousseau to Secretary of State William H. Seward: Due to the 11-hour time difference between Sitka and St. Petersburg, and the fact that Russia still used the Julian calendar, the date is sometimes given as Saturday, October 7. Observance Alaska's territorial legislature declared Alaska Day a holiday in 1917. It is a paid holiday for state employees. The official celebration is held in Sitka, where schools release students early, many businesses close for the day, and events such as a parade and reenactment of the flag raising are held. It should not be confused with Seward's Day, the last Monday in March, which commemorates the signing of the treaty for the Alaska Purchase in which the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia on March 30, 1867. Protest Alaska Day is protested by some Alaska Native people who view the holiday as an celebration of the violence used to take their land away. Native organizers assert that the land was not Russia's to sell in the first place, therefore the sale of the land to the U.S. is illegitimate.

It was written and produced by Roberta Leigh in association with the Associated British Corporation. Summary The series features the vocal talents of Dick Vosburgh, Ronnie Stevens, Libby Morris, Murray Kash and Ysanne Churchman, and comprises 39 half-hour episodes. This series is also known by its US title Planet Patrol to avoid confusion with the 1950s American live-action series of the same name. The marionettes used in the series incorporated some elements of Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation technique ‚Äì specifically their mouths would move in synch with dialogue. The series is set in the year 2100, by which time the indigenous and autonomous civilizations on Earth, Mars and Venus have banded together to form the United Galactic Organization (UGO). Space Patrol is the UGO's military wing, and the series follows the actions of this interplanetary force, focusing on the missions of a tiny unit led by the heroic, bearded Captain Larry Dart. The humanoids in his crew consist of the elfin Slim from Venus, and the stocky, ravenously sausage-mad Husky from the Red Planet, Mars. The imperfect Slavic accent variants and six-pointed star chest emblems of these two may have been a sly nod to the Jewish-Russian heritage of the English series creator/writer. These men would regularly use one of two interplanetary space vehicles, the Galasphere 347 and the Galasphere 024. Providing technical support on Earth is the brilliant and inventive Irishman Professor Aloysius O‚ÄôBrien O‚ÄôRourke Haggarty,Space Patrol: The Website: Slim's Encyclopedia: H called \\"Pop\\" by his daughter Cassiopeia, to his perpetual dismay. Haggarty's garrulous pet Martian \\"parrot\\" (a Gabblerdictum bird), taught to talk in \\"The Slaves of Neptune\\" episode, accompanies the crew on rare occasions. Keeping them all on a tight rein are Colonel Raeburn and his super-efficient Venusian secretary, Marla, both also based on Earth. The show reflected sex roles characteristic of the culture and era which produced it, but blonde and brainy Marla would often explicitly point out that \\"There are no dumb blondes on Venus.\\" Indeed, the series was created and written by the prolific polymath artist Roberta Leigh, the first woman producer in Britain to have her own film company. The series was sold overseas and broadcast in the US, Canada and Australia, and in spite of the very low budget ‚Äì which meant that sometimes the shadow of a puppet could be seen behind a \\"TV Screen\\" before the communication device was supposedly turned on ‚Äîthe show rated strongly with young audiences in many regions (including New York City)allmovie.com ‚Äì Space Patrol and garnered a huge following. Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski said that it was his favourite TV show as a child. Background Leigh had previously worked with Gerry Anderson on children's puppet series, and there are some obvious similarities between Space Patrol and Anderson's Fireball XL5, although Space Patrol was made on a lower budget. Arthur Provis, Anderson's former business partner in AP Films was responsible for the cinematography. For many years it was believed that all but a handful of episodes had been destroyed, until a complete cache of 16 mm prints was discovered in the garage of Roberta Leigh's home. Despite their scratched and grainy condition, they were of sufficient historic interest to warrant a commercial release, initially on VHS tapes, and later on DVD. Two episodes have survived from the original 35 mm prints and these were later made available on Blu-ray Disc. Original style of the series Although compared (and often confused) with the Gerry Anderson productions (due to the similar use of voice-synchronised marionettes), Space Patrol is distinguished by some of its creative choices. The only music involved is avant-garde, the theme being made by Roberta Leigh herself using electronic equipment she bought from a local store after asking an assistant for anything that made interesting noises. F. C. Judd was responsible for creating all the electronic music for the series; he was an early British electronic experimenter, amateur radio expert, circuit designer, author and contributor to many wireless and electronics magazines from the 1950s to the 1990s. In addition, the marionettes used for Space Patrol were more realistic- looking and less cartoon-like than those being used on Fireball XL5; in terms of relative realism, the puppets of Space Patrol fall between that of Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. There were two types of robots, and the ones with the thick upper bodies were mainly used. Final credits always showed panoramic views over a gigantic city of the future, and never featured any music; only the throb of some industrial machinery, sounding like a gigantic pump or a steam engine, beat in rhythm. The male characters from the planet Venus (Slim for example) presented obvious androgyne features (in contrast to the rustic, virile Martians). The science Whereas Gerry Anderson had a rocket ship in Fireball XL5 that could travel light years to planets around other stars as though they were just a few million miles away, Space Patrol took a more realistic approach. Because of limited speed, trips to other planets in our solar system could take weeks or months and this was facilitated by the crew of the Galasphere going into a freezer chamber and being put in suspended animation for the trip. A robot would then take over (its movements were said to cost ¬£2,000 a time rather than being just a puppet.) The zirgon ray (faster than light) could be used from Earth to wake them up in an emergency. The term \\"galaxy\\" was used inaccurately, but consistently, to refer to a solar system in the series, so \\"Galactic Control\\" only supervised the local planets and \\"other galaxies\\" referred to nearby star-systems. On other planets, they would use dial- selector translators (dial P for Pluto) to talk to alien beings ‚Äì at the time, even some serious scientists considered the possibility of life on Venus, Mars and maybe elsewhere. Unusually for a TV show, the translators didn't instantly pick up new languages; they had to be programmed on Earth before they could be used, a lengthy process requiring recordings of the alien language. Life support in hazardous atmospheres was provided by a \\"Mo-lung\\" (short for 'Mobile Lung')- a sealed cylindrical transparent helmet, and the crew would often ride around on \\"Hover Jets\\", or more rarely, an \\"Ion Gun\\" which looked like a giant sparkler firework. Neptune was said to have atomic heating but none of the planets were really cold, such as when Dart walked about on Pluto (in \\"The Buried Spaceship\\") without any extra protection in what would be temperatures of about ‚àí230 ¬∞C. The Galasphere had a top speed of about 800,000 mph, using \\"meson power\\". In \\"The Talking Bell\\" episode, they use \\"Boost Speed\\", which is dangerous, but allows them to travel at almost one million miles per hour for a long period. Meson power is dangerous to use in atmosphere. The engine also used gamma rays and 'Yobba rays'. The Galasphere has a force field which would protect it from enemy missiles, and it also turned out to protect them from the mind control of the evil Neptunians who were thousands of years ahead of Earth people, with great mental powers, and who hated work. The Galasphere was constructed of Plutonite from Pluto, and a number of times, like in \\"The Human Fish\\", it also travelled underwater. Pluto was the furthest they normally travelled but after an accident they went way beyond that to a self-heated new planet which was full of giants who treated the Galasphere as a toy. Another time, an alien from Alpha Centauri visited them and installed a device which allowed the Galasphere to travel faster than light (at which point it vanished). They had their adventure twenty five trillion miles away and then returned to Earth, and just made it, with Galasphere 347 collapsing under the strain of such travel, just as they left it. In \\"The Planet of Light\\", Dart and Slim were taken to a planet circling Sirius (8.7 light years away) in just a few hours. This fast journey was necessary as the \\"light beings\\" who took them would be poisoned by air, so the two had to rely on their own supplies. In \\"The Rings of Saturn\\" and a minority of other episodes, the crew rode the Galasphere 024, rather than the Galasphere 347. The references to Galasphere 024 are, for the most part, continuity errors introduced by the continual re-use of stock footage from the pilot episode, \\"The Swamps of Jupiter\\". Although the Galasphere is referred to as 024 during the takeoff programme sequence, it is often later referred to as 347 in the same episode.

(DVD Disc 6) Original UK Broadcasts Space Patrol debuted on Sunday, 7 April 1963 on ABC Weekend TV, at the time the ITV contractor for England's Midlands and North. The series was shown in several episodic blocks over the following five years, with the final episodes airing over ABC's last weeks on air during the summer of 1968. Following these broadcasts, the series was never repeated in the UK. In the London area, Space Patrol was shown on weekdays by Associated Rediffusion. U.S. Broadcasts Planet Patrol was distributed in the U.S. by M & A Alexander Productions. It debuted in the U.S. on WPIX, a local New York station, on Sunday, 12 January 1964, at 5:30 p.m. It was sponsored by Drake's Cakes.Broadcasting, 27 January 1964. The show appeared in Los Angeles in September 1964 on KHJ- TV.\\"Outstanding Films Scheduled by KHJ.\\" Los Angeles Times, 13 Sept. 1964 The show appears on the schedule of Boston's WKBG-TV in January 1967. Production The series was filmed in two separate production blocks consisting of 26 and 13 episodes, which are considered as the first and second series. The final 13 episodes employ refurbished puppets and sets, and are copyrighted 1962 Wonderama Productions on the end credits (the first 26 episodes omitted any on-screen copyright information). Various puppets from the series were re-used in later Roberta Leigh productions including Wonderboy and Tiger and Send for Dithers. These colour films reveal the fact that the Gabblerdictum was bright pink. Other than two endpapers from the TV Comic Annual for 1966, no colour photographic materials from the series have survived. These images indicate that the puppets were dressed in monochromatic uniforms, although most comic strip and book illustrations depict them as red and silver.

In Other Media A small number of Space Patrol episodes were made available in the Standard-8 and Super-8 home movie formats from Mountain Films during the 1960s and 70s. Episodes known to have been released in this format are: \\"The Swamps of Jupiter\\", \\"The Miracle Tree of Saturn\\", \\"The Robot Revolution\\" and \\"Mystery on the Moon.\\" The films were released in 400' sound editions, and packaging for all titles used the same artwork as the first release, \\"Mystery on the Moon.\\" The title Space Patrol did not appear anywhere on the packaging. The films were all around 16 minutes long, with most of the material coming from the second act of the episodes. The complete series was released by Network on VHS tape following the recovery of the episodes in the late 1990s. Comic strip adaptations A number of comic strip adaptations of Space Patrol were produced: *TV Comic: 52 double-page strips forming the centerspread of each issue, in issues 668 to 719. They were written by Roberta Leigh herself and illustrated by artist Bill Mevin, and in color it was shown that Venusians had blue skin and Martians green. *Beezer: from issue 558 dated 24 September 1966 to issue 583 dated 18 March 1967, illustrated by artist Terry Patrick (ie 26 2-page colour episodes in total). *Two Super Mag comics. *A 1965 Wonderama Productions annual with both stories by Roberta Leigh and illustrations by R.

The network carried a mix of newscasts from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other international networks. After several ownership changes, the channel was purchased by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and other parties in 2005 and became Current TV. History The network was launched on June 1, 1994, as a joint venture between the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Power Corporation of Canada along with sister channel Trio. It aired much of the same programming as the CBC-owned Canadian cable news channel CBC Newsworld. During the late 1990s, Newsworld International's Sunday evening newscast at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time aired on CBC-owned CBET in Windsor, Ontario as a replacement for the ABC family movie anthology series The Wonderful World of Disney, which aired on most other CBC stations in that timeslot (Windsor is part of the Detroit market for programming purposes, as such, stations in Southwestern Ontario near the U.S.‚ÄìCanada border pre-empt certain U.S.-based programs whose rights are held by Canadian networks to avoid paying higher advertising rates). The channel reached about 20 million homes and provided news coverage from a variety of global perspectives. It also acted as a news source for Canadians who reside or were visiting the United States, Latin America or the Caribbean. The channel was available across the United States mainly on satellite provider DirecTV. In 2000, Newsworld International was sold to USA Networks for $155 million, which was subsequently acquired by Vivendi (which later merged with Universal Pictures to become Vivendi Universal). The CBC maintained day-to-day operation of the channel afterward. The network's main in-house news program was NWI International NewsFirst. =Shutdown and replacements= In 2004, Newsworld International was purchased by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Joel Hyatt, who acquired it mainly for the channel's digital cable and satellite coverage reach, and were not interested in maintaining the network's existing format. Programming on Newsworld continued to be provided by the CBC until July 31, 2005; on that date, the network ceased operations with a special farewell message from the channel's Toronto offices on behalf of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. Gore and Hyatt relaunched the channel at midnight on August 1 as Current TV, specializing in a youth perspective on national issues. Gore and Hyatt chose the format after deciding that a liberal-focused news network would be rejected by national advertisers. The new channel, despite being profitable, underwent a major reorganization in 2010 after a \\"troubled\\" history, eventually evolving it into a progressive- leaning news and documentary channel. Gore and his partners sold the network to Al Jazeera Media Network in 2013, which like Gore and Hyatt before them, was mainly interested in taking over the channel's existing carriage deals, using Current's channel space to launch the internationally focused news channel Al Jazeera America that August. Al Jazeera America in turn failed in April 2016, after which the channel space created by NWI in 1994 ceased to exist. After the closure of the channel, the CBC began uploading some of its news programs and reports as clips on CBC.ca for online viewing worldwide. Today, CBC News Network ‚Äì the former parent channel of Newsworld International ‚Äì carries many of the CBC programs formerly seen on Newsworld, and is available worldwide outside of Canada online through paid subscriptions.http://www.cbc.ca/news2/networkstream/ 29th June 2014 Programming =Original series= Newsworld International produced Special Assignment, a half-hour documentary series hosted by veteran CBC correspondent Bill Cunningham, featuring a different country in each episode. The format included a segment of historical context on the featured country with archive footage narrated by Cunningham, followed by a recap of recent political developments and current events. The program often featured interviews with high-ranking government officials and political insiders. During its run, Special Assignment visited many countries in Europe, East Asia and Latin America as well as countries in Africa and the Caribbean.

Paxton Automotive is a United States-based manufacturer of superchargers for automotive use. The company is the major proponent of the centrifugal type supercharger. Early products were offered under the McCulloch name. Some Paxton superchargers have been factory fitted, but most units sold have been aftermarket installed. Paxton products are possibly best known for their frequent use in performance- modified Ford Mustangs. Inventor Robert Paxton McCulloch began producing superchargers to his design in 1937 for the Ford Flathead V8, a popular engine for performance modification at the time. The company estimates that around 5,000 were built before World War II stopped production. Postwar, McCulloch developed a more sophisticated supercharger and began selling it in 1953. This was factory fitted to a number of vehicles at the time, including the Kaiser Manhattan, Packard Panther, Studebaker Golden Hawk, 1957 Packard Clipper and 1958 Packard Hawk. In 1956, McCulloch set up a separate Paxton Superchargers division, selling it off in 1958. Supercharged engines were used for one successful year in NASCAR racing, after which forced induction was banned from the sport. For this purpose, Paxton superchargers were fitted as the rare (211 produced) F-option for the 1957 Ford Thunderbird. A short run of Shelby Mustangs were fitted with Paxton superchargers, and Ford dealers offered Paxton superchargers as a dealer-fitted Ford Mustang option from 1965 to 1972. Paxton still provides supercharger kits for older Mustangs as well as more recent models. Still in business as a subsidiary of Vortech, Paxton now supplies complete supercharging kits for popular performance-modified cars, as well as bare superchargers for more customised installations. One of the more unusual applications for the Paxton brand superchargers was as an air pump in the air purifying CO2 scrubbers of U.S. Navy submarines.

History Douglas Island was originally a border of the Auke people‚Äôs and Taku people‚Äôs territory. It was not usually used for year-round settlement, but rather as a place to spend the summer, or at times a place for battles. Some historical reports indicate an early settler to the area may be credited for the naming of Douglas Island. In 1880 gold was discovered in Juneau, Alaska, across the narrow Gastineau Channel, drawing in all kinds of people looking to strike it rich. In 1881 two towns sprouted up on Douglas Island: Treadwell and Douglas. Treadwell was the community for the miners, with its own entertainment, pool, and bar. Douglas, too, had businesses popping up and soon had its own school and post office. A railroad and boardwalk connected the two towns. At this time the Treadwell power plant was large enough to power the entire Treadwell area, Douglas, and Juneau. The power plant continued to serve the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mine until the mine was shut down in 1944 by the War Department as non-essential to the war effort. In 1902, the city of Douglas was incorporated. The town sustained significant damage on March 9, 1911 when a fire started in the Douglas Grill. It took the Douglas, Treadwell, and Juneau fire departments working together to stop the entire town from being destroyed. The towns of Douglas and Treadwell underwent changes after the 1917 cave-in of the Treadwell mine. While one section still operated until 1926, Treadwell shrank and Douglas became the town of Douglas Island. Douglas continued to have its own dairy (Douglas Dairy, owned by Joe Kendler) until 1923 when it moved across the channel. At this time, there was a regular ferry between the towns of Juneau and Douglas. In 1935, the Douglas Bridge was opened and made transportation between the island and Juneau simpler. On February 23, 1937, the city of Douglas again experienced a devastating fire, with 600 of the 700 residents losing their homes. However, Douglas rebuilt and restarted. On March 8, 1955 the city voted to combine schools with the city of Juneau, resulting in the construction of Juneau-Douglas High School, which continues to serve the area's students. In a controversial moment in 1970, voters in the cities of Douglas and Juneau, and of the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough, elected to unify their respective governments, forming the present-day City and Borough of Juneau. Demographics Douglas first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as \\"Douglas City.\\" Despite its name, it was still an unincorporated community. It appeared as Douglas in 1900 and formally incorporated in 1902. In 1970, voters in the city of Douglas and Juneau Division approved a merger with the city and borough of Juneau. In 1890, Douglas was the 11th largest community in Alaska with 402 residents. Of those, 356 were White, 26 were Native, 17 were Creole (Mixed Russian & Native), 2 were Asian and 1 was Other.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1890a_v8-01.pdf In 1900, Douglas was the 7th largest community in Alaska with 825 residents. It did not report a racial breakdown. In 1910, Douglas was the 3rd largest city in Alaska with 1,722 residents (exceeding neighboring Juneau, which was in 4th place with 1,644 residents and 6th placed Treadwell on the south border of Douglas with 1,222 residents). It reported 1,344 Whites, 346 Natives and 32 others. Had all three locales been unified as they are today, they would've been the most populous locale that year with 4,588 residents, exceeding Fairbanks (3,541) as the largest city. In 1920, Douglas fell to 7th place (919); in 1930 it was at 11th (593); in 1940 it was at 18th (522); in 1950 it was at 20th (699); in 1960 it was at 23rd (1,042); and in 1970 it was at 29th (1,243). Infrastructure The only traditional school left on Douglas is Gastineau Elementary, which serves all the Douglas Island elementary-aged students; the Douglas Public Library is part of the Juneau Public Library System. Douglas has a few restaurants and bars (The Island Pub, Louie's Douglas Inn, and The Douglas Caf√©), a local live theater (Perseverance Theater), and a gas station. The town‚Äôs population has dropped over the years but recently is up to about 3,000 people, or close to ten percent of the City and Borough of Juneau‚Äôs population. Douglas gets its water and electricity from Juneau and has a mix of onsite and municipal (diverted to Juneau) wastewater treatment.

She considered herself to be mainly a poet, but is now best appreciated for her witty and ironic stories.Adelaide (1986) p. 3 Anderson has been described as \\"a high-profile author, artist, art commentator and emissary for modernism\\". Life Ethel Anderson was born in Leamington, in Warwickshire, England of Australian parents. Her family soon moved back to Australia and she grew up in Sydney and at Rangamatty, near Picton, New South Wales. She was educated at the Church of England Girls' Grammar School in Sydney.Australian Verse: An Illustrated Treasury, edited by Beatrice Davis, State Library of New South Wales Press, 1996 In 1904 she married Brigadier-General Austin Anderson in Bombay where she had accompanied him on his posting. In 1907 they had a daughter. At the beginning of World War I her husband was posted to France and Anderson moved to Cambridge, England, where she studied drawing at Downing College and exhibited some of her work. They later lived in Worcestershire, and on her husband's retirement from the army in 1924 the family moved to Turramurra, New South Wales, and Brigadier Anderson became secretary to several State Governors. In Turramurra, Ethel Anderson founded the Turramurra Wall Painters Union in 1927 and associated with contemporary artists such as Roy de Maistre and Grace Cossington Smith. An exhibition of Roland Wakelin's work was held at her home. She was asked by the rector of St James' Church, Sydney to help decorate the Children's Chapel and designed a mural scheme for it which was executed by the group in 1929. Anne Speer's UNSW MA Research Thesis, \\"Ethel Anderson: pioneer supporter of Sydney's Post-Impressionists\\" (1994) documents her work with this group of artists (see SLNSW MLMSS 5951). On 16 March 1932, she opened the inaugural exhibition of the Modern Art Centre established by Dorrit Black in Margaret Street, Sydney, to teach and promote the Cubist ideas learned during Black's study trip to France. Anderson also wrote about contemporary artists' work for magazines such as Art in Australia and Home, while her poetry and stories were published in The Spectator, Punch, the Cornhill Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Bulletin. Her poetry was influenced by her knowledge of French literature and Modernist work, with considerable formal and metrical experimentation. Her poem The Song of Hagar was set to music by John Antill. The death of her husband in 1949 meant that she had to support herself, which she did through her writing, serialising her first novel At Parramatta in The Bulletin. She died on 4 August 1958 in Sydney.

The terms thus defined will often involve emotionally charged but imprecise notions, such as \\"freedom\\", \\"terrorism\\", \\"democracy\\", etc. In argumentation the use of a persuasive definition is sometimes called definist fallacy. (The latter sometimes more broadly refers to a fallacy of a definition based on improper identification of two distinct properties.) Examples of persuasive definitions (definist fallacies) include: * Democrat - \\"a leftist who desires to overtax the corporations and abolish freedom in the economic sphere\\". *\\"Let's define atheist as someone who doesn't yet realize that God exists.\\" Persuasive definitions commonly appear in controversial topics such as politics, sex, and religion, as participants in emotionally charged exchanges will sometimes become more concerned about swaying people to one side or another than expressing the unbiased facts. A persuasive definition of a term is favorable to one argument or unfavorable to the other argument, but is presented as if it were neutral and well-accepted, and the listener is expected to accept such a definition without question. The term \\"persuasive definition\\" was introduced by philosopher Charles Stevenson as part of his emotive theory of meaning. Overview Language can simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings (expressive). Unlike other common types of definitions in logic, persuasive definitions focus on the expressive use of language to affect the feelings of readers and listeners ultimately with an aim to change their behavior. With this fundamentally different purpose, persuasive definitions are evaluated not on their truth or falsehood but rather on their effectiveness as a persuasive device. Stevenson showed how these two dimensions are combined when he investigated the terms he called \\"ethical\\" or emotive. He noted that some words, such as peace or war, are not simply used to describe reality by modifying the cognitive response of the interlocutor. They have also the power of directing the interlocutor's attitudes and suggesting a course of action. For this reason, they evoke a different kind of reaction, emotive in nature. As Stevenson put it \\"Instead of merely describing people's interests, they change and intensify them. They recommend an interest in an object, rather than state that the interest already exists.\\" These words have the tendency to encourage future actions, to lead the hearer towards a decision by affecting his or her system of interests. Stevenson distinguished between the use of a word (a stimulus) and its possible psychological effects on the addressee's cognitive and the emotive reactions by labeling them as \\"descriptive meaning\\" and \\"emotive meaning\\". Applying this distinction reveals how the redefinition of an ethical word is transformed into an instrument of persuasion, a tool for redirecting preferences and emotions: ::Ethical definitions involve a wedding of descriptive and emotive meaning, and accordingly have a frequent use in redirecting and intensifying attitudes. To choose a definition is to plead a cause, so long as the word defined is strongly emotive. In persuasive definitions the evaluative component associated with a concept is left unaltered while the descriptive meaning is modified. In this fashion, imprisonment can become \\"true freedom\\", and massacres \\"pacification\\". Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while keeping the original evaluations that the use of a word evokes. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the emotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define a word by qualifying the without setting forth what the term actually means. For instance, we can consider the following quasi-definition taken from Casanova's Fuga dai Piombi. In this example (1), the speaker, Mr. Soradaci, tries to convince his interlocutor (Casanova) that being a \\"sneak\\" is an honorable behavior: ::I have always despised the prejudice that attaches to the name \\"spy\\" a hateful meaning: this name sounds bad only to the ears of who hates the Government. A sneak is just a friend of the good of the State, the plague of the crooks, the faithful servant of his Prince. This quasi-definition employed in case 1 underscores a fundamental dimension of the \\"emotive\\" meaning of a word, namely its relationship with the shared values, which are attacked as \\"prejudices.\\" This account given by the spy shows how describing the referent based on a different hierarchy of values can modify emotive meaning. The value of trust is not denied, but is placed in a hierarchy where the highest worth is given to the State. Stevenson provides us with two definitions of the word culture in order to illustrate what a persuasive definition can accomplish: *The original definition: \\"widely read and acquainted with arts\\" *The persuasive definition: \\"imaginative sensitivity\\" Both carry with them the positive emotive meaning of culture; it is still a good thing to be cultured no matter which definition is used. What they change is what exactly it means to be called \\"cultured.\\" Because being cultured is a positive trait, the society views being well read and acquainted with the arts as positive traits to have. By promoting a persuasive definition of \\"imaginative sensitivity\\" the society begins to views those qualities positively because they are attached to a word with a positive emotive meaning. Unclear, figurative language is often used in persuasive definitions. Although several techniques can be used to form such a definition, the genus and difference technique is the usual one applied. Both definitions in the taxation example above agree that the genus is a procedure relating to governance but disagree on the difference. Persuasive definitions combine elements of stipulative definitions, lexical definitions, and sometimes theoretical definitions. Persuasive definitions commonly appear in political speeches, editorials and other situations where the power to influence is most in demand. They have been dismissed as serving only to confuse readers and listeners without legitimate purpose. Critical scrutiny is often necessary to identify persuasive definitions in an argument as they are meant to appear as honest definitions.

He is best known as the designer for the appearance of the Emmy award statuette and symbol for the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. During the 1930s, McManus worked primarily as an editor and edited many films and shorts, including those featuring Laurel and Hardy and the Our Gang characters. In addition to editing, he also designed the title cards for many films. It was his work as a designer that inspired him to submit a design entry for the Emmy award in 1948. He used his wife, Dorothy, as a model for the figure. His design was ultimately chosen for the award, out of a field of forty-eight other proposals submitted. McManus was awarded an Emmy statue (in the Special Award category) in 1949 (the first year awards were presented) for his work in designing the Emmy.

Thane is a neighborhood in the City and Borough of Juneau in the U.S. state of Alaska. Located along Gastineau Channel, it begins one mile (1.6 km) south of downtown Juneau and consists of approximately five dozen houses spread over five miles (8 km). All the houses are located on Thane Road, which comes to a dead end about six miles (10 km) from downtown; there are no side streets. It was named for Bartlett L. Thane, Manager and Director of the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company. The only electric link to Snettisham hydroelectric dam - Juneau‚Äôs primary electric power plant - travels through Thane. Avalanches knock out this power line somewhat routinely, forcing the local power company, Alaska Electric Light & Power, to keep a series of reserve diesel generators on standby. History Thane was founded in 1881 as a result of mining operations in the vicinity. Since World War II the population has steadily declined with the curtailment of mining activities. It is now a residential area (DeArmond, 1957, p43-44). =Etymology= The community was named in 1914 for Bartlett L. Thane, 1878‚Äì1927, general manager of the Alaska Gastineau Mining Co. which had its mill here. Thane was born in California and went to Alaska in 1897. The name Sheep Creek, which was the original miners' name for the town, was published by United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in the 1901 Coast Pilot, but was later changed to Thane by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Demographics Thane first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It continued to appear until the 1960 census. It was annexed into Juneau soon after. Geography Thane lies on the eastern shore of Gastineau Channel, southeast of Juneau and northwest of Point Salisbury, Coast Mountains. Government Juneau assesses personal property and real estate taxes, and distributes a portion of collections to settlements within the Borough. Tax rates are generally low. Media Radio and television broadcast are available either via satellite or from local broadcasts in Juneau, Alaska.

It separates Juneau on the mainland side from Douglas (now part of Juneau), on Douglas Island. The first European to sight the channel was Joseph Whidbey early in August 1794, first from the south and later from the west. It was probably named for John Gastineau, an English civil engineer and surveyor.http://www.ggsalaska.org Gastineau Genealogical Society Characteristics The channel is navigable by large ships, only from the southeast, as far as the Douglas Bridge, approximately . Between the bridge and Juneau International Airport, approximately , it is navigable only by smaller craft and only at high tide. The channel is becoming increasingly unnavigable due to shallow water depths. The two principal causes for this are: # Isostatic rebound following the retreat of glacial ice sheets # Sedimentation and infilling of the Gastineau Channel by silty sediment produced by the Mendenhall Glacier and Mendenhall River. If current trends continue, Gastineau Channel may eventually become dry or unnavigable or both. During isostatic rebound, the Earth's lithosphere (crust) is slowly rising because of buoyant forces, following the removal of a large mass on the surface. Thatcan be likened to an ice cube floating in a glass of water with a penny sitting on top. The weight of the penny makes the ice cube float lower, similar to the immense weight of a glacier on top of the lithosphere. When the penny (glacier) is removed, the ice cube (lithosphere) \\"rebounds\\" and floats slightly higher. In the geologic case, that scenario happens very slowly. Rates of isostatic rebound throughout SE Alaska vary from 0.1 to 1.5 inches/year depending on glacial history. The approximate rebound rate in the Juneau area is 0.25 to 0.5 inches/year.

The band consisted of frontman Terry Bickers (formerly guitarist with The House of Love), drummer David Francolini, guitarist Christian Hayes, bassist Laurence O'Keefe and keyboardist Robert White. Bickers announced his departure from the band onstage at Tufnell Park Dome in north London on 14 May 1993. The release of the band's already completed second album Meanwhile Gardens was shelved. The band enlisted former Some Have Fins frontman Steve Ludwin to replace Bickers, and in 1994 the new lineup released a remixed version of Meanwhile Gardens in Australia featuring new vocals from Ludwin. The band split in October 1994, leaving their second album remaining unreleased. Hayes, Francolini and O'Keefe regrouped in 1996 to form Dark Star. They released Twenty Twenty Sound in 1999 before disbanding in 2001.  History  =Formation & Early EPs= Following his departure from The House Of Love in 1990, Terry Bickers began forming a new band with drummer David Francolini. The pair met during Bickers' last tour with his previous band in December 1989, on which Francolini was playing with support band Something Pretty Beautiful whom he joined just days before going out on tour. They first enlisted Christian Hayes, who had played with Ring and Panixphere, played bass in The Dave Howard Singers and was currently playing guitar in Cardiacs and working as a courier. Bickers knew Hayes through musical friends in South London, and when Bickers and Francolini spotted Hayes on his courier bike by chance in Covent Garden, London they arranged to meet up in the studio. Hayes' former Ring bandmate, keyboardist Robert White (also formerly of Zag and the Coloured Beads) soon joined along with bassist Joe Allen and violinist Johnny T, a member of The Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra. The band first played low key shows in France supporting Ride, and in Belgium supporting Galaxie 500. Soon after Johnny T left the band along with Allen, who was replaced by former Jazz Butcher bassist Laurence O'Keefe, whom Francolini knew through touring with The Blue Aeroplanes. The band signed to the independent label Ultimate Records and released their debut release in April 1991, Nadine/Coppelia EP. It was made \\"Single Of The Week\\" in Melody Maker, but received a negative review in the NME. Original bassist Joe Allen appeared on early recordings Nadine and Paid In Kind. In August 1991 the band released the After Ever EP, which again made \\"Single Of The Week\\" in Melody Maker who described the EP as \\"blessed genius\\". The following month, the band released the low key single Squirrel (and early recording featuring the first lineup of the band) via the new Rough Trade mail-order 7\\" vinyl singles club. Through 1991 the band toured extensively, supporting the likes of Pere Ubu, All About Eve, the Psychedelic Furs and Hawkwind. The band were dropped from a tour supporting Transvision Vamp, officially because their equipment required too much stage space, but reports suggested that the headliners were worried about being overshadowed by Levitation who were receiving a lot of press due to Bickers' profile from his work with The House Of Love.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave, Virgin Books, , p. 245 The band also received further press attention from outlandish and eccentric comments Bickers would make to the press, which often displayed a fondness for conspiracy theories, leading him to be labelled \\"Bonkers Bickers\\". In November 1991 a compilation album, Coterie, was released collating tracks from the band's previous releases along with new live recordings. The album was the first to be released in the US, via Capitol Records and saw the band play their first dates there in Los Angeles and New York. =Rough Trade & Need For Not= Following the release of Coterie, the band left Ultimate and signed to Rough Trade. They also signed to EMI in Germany and Festival Records in Australia, along with Capitol Records in North & South America. They released World Around, their first single for the label in February 1992 which reached the top five in the UK Indie Chart. Leviation were kicked off another tour after just three gigs, supporting The Fall. The Fall's frontman Mark E Smith reportedly took exception to the amount of time the band took to sound check and how much dry ice they used during their set. Smith allegedly called the band \\"a bunch of fucking poofs\\". The band released their debut album, Need For Not on 4 May 1992 (the adverts for the album proclaiming \\"May the Fourth be with you\\"). Throughout the summer the band toured with Cardiacs, and performed at Reading Festival. The band didn't tour the album in the US as Bickers refused to go, with O'Keefe commenting that \\"Terry was acutely paranoid of America and failed to join us in New York and started to be a real drag\\". He described the moment as \\"the exact point at which the dynamic changed irreparably\\". =Further recording and departure of Terry Bickers= Following the collapse of Rough Trade, Levitation signed to Chrysalis, a sub-label that was owned by EMI Germany with whom the band were signed to there. The band began working on their second album, Meanwhile Gardens. After recording so much material towards it, the band decided it would be released in two parts, \\"Summer\\" and \\"Autumn\\". Francolini revealed that the band \\"started the album last year but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt finance the recording. But in the time we were looking around for the money we wrote a lot more material, which we have since recorded rather quickly\\". With the first part completed, the band released lead off single Even When Your Eyes Are Open in April 1993. However, Bickers announced his departure from the band onstage at the Dome in Tufnell Park, London the following month on 14 May. He proclaimed from the stage that \\"Levitation certainly are a lost cause as far as I can tell. We've completely lost it, haven't we? Haven't we?\\". The band had played Glasgow the previous night, and due to transportation problems had had no sleep. O'Keefe commented that \\"obviously the demons within and the repressed emotions were released, along with all the other toys from the pram\\" A mailout to the band's fanclub featured a statement from Hayes, in which he described Bickers' departure as \\"an unfortunate but necessary stick in the spokes... Terry no longer wishes to be in Levitation, feeling no excitement for the material and therefore uncomfortable within the band\\". The band maintained that his departure was positive for all involved. A later statement on 1 June read, \\"Terry Bickers (the one who stood in the middle) has parted company with Levitation... We believe the circumstances in which we now find ourselves presents us with the oil to lubricate our gears\\". Bickers would later admit that his mounting depression had much to do with the manner of his departure and added that \\"it was a crap thing to do. It was unfair on the people that came to see us and on everyone in the band... The reason I left the way I did was because I didn't want to give anyone the opportunity to talk me round.\\" Hayes would also later admit, \\"I think Terry could have definitely done with more support. He had begun a family and had pressures outside our creative bubble that were out of my experience. I'm afraid I was way too self-absorbed to appreciate the difficulty of the situation he was in\\". The album was shelved and a string of shows were cancelled, including a headline slot at the Phoenix Festival, a support slot with The Cure on their Great Expectations gig at Finsbury Park and a US tour with Spiritualized, The Verve and Mercury Rev. =The Steve Ludwin lineup, the reworked Meanwhile Gardens and the final split= Determined to continue, Levitation set about auditioning new singers. Although it was rumoured that the band initially asked former All About Eve singer Julianne Regan, the band announced in August 1993 the arrival of American singer Steve Ludwin who had previously fronted the London-based band Some Have Fins. It was noted in the press that the band were seen as a quintessentially English band, and Hayes responded that he \\"did personally have some reservations about us using an American vocal though, purely for sound reasons, and I do think that it does change the sound from how it was\\". The new line-up played a series of gigs in Germany and at the Splash Club (at the Water Rats in King's Cross) in May and June 1994. A subsequent letter to the fan club stated, \\"The storm has passed and the voyage may begin again.\\" The reception for the Ludwin fronted lineup however was mixed. Instead of working on new material, the band decided to remix the existing Meanwhile Gardens album and overdub new vocals by Ludwin, removing most traces of Bickers. Hayes stated that the band \\"really liked the material, we'd spent a year and a half to two years writing it all, and it seemed such a waste to just dump it\\". The new version received a low key release in Australia, along with a single release of King Of Mice in Germany. The band were reportedly plagued by continuing and escalating rows (Francolini would later describe Ludwin as \\"a vapid, careerist fool of a man and a complete waste of time\\"), and it was announced in October 1994 that the band had finally split up. Post-Split Immediately following his departure from the band, Bickers formed Paradise Estate with guitarist Clive Giblin. After Bickers' and Giblin' partnership dissolved, Bickers began working on material with his partner Caroline Tree and other musicians. They signed a development deal with Geoff Travis for Blanco y Negro Records and recorded an album which he would later describe as \\"eclectic if also a little unfocused\\". The album was shelved and the band were dropped from the label before anything was released. Bickers and Tree began work on new material and were reunited with Clive Giblin in the band Cradle, who released the Baba Yaga album in 1996 on Ultimate Records. The band split yet again before the end of the year. In 1996, Bickers briefly resurfaced with the Brighton-based Monkey 7. In 2003, he reformed The House of Love with Guy Chadwick, who have since released two albums Days Run Away and She Paints Words In Red. Christian Hayes, David Francolini and Laurence O'Keefe regrouped in 1996 to form Dark Star. They released a number of EPs and the 1999 album Twenty Twenty Sound on EMI. Despite recording a second album in 2000, they split up in 2001 leaving the album unreleased. O'Keefe then embarked on a session career, while Hayes briefly played guitar in the Pet Shop Boys live band and subsequently released three solo albums of archive material under the name Mikrokosmos. Francolini re-surfaced in 2007 with a new band Dragons who released one album before splitting in 2009. Robert White went on to front the Brighton-based The Milk And Honey Band. Several independent albums have been released and have worked with Andy Partridge's APE label. Steve Ludwin went on to form Pura Vida, who were originally set to feature Francolini on drums. The band released several EPs on Org Records and later evolved into Carrie, who released one album, Fear of Sound in 1998. In 2001, Ludwin formed Little Hell. Ludwin also unsuccessfully auditioned to be the lead singer for Velvet Revolver. Ludwin has since moved into songwriting and production and has worked with artists including Ash, Betty Curse, The Crimea and Good Shoes. He also produced the MTV Europe show \\"Annoying Americans\\".Steve Ludwin biography on Nuxx homepage, retrieved 27 October 2008 Spin-offs and reissues Following the band's split, several releases were announced for future release including The Barn Sessions (an instrumental album featuring Hayes, Francolini, O'Keefe & White) and The Departure Lounge (a collaboration between Francolini & White), along with mixing the second part of Meanwhile Gardens and releasing the complete album in its original form. In 2007, Francolini confirmed plans for a Levitation re-issue campaign via Rough Trade (including the original, never released, version of Meanwhile Gardens along with an expanded edition of Need For Not and other unreleased material). However, it was later revealed that this didn't happen after Rough Trade again went into liquidation, and Beggars Banquet Records who bought the label out didn't wish to continue with the releases. In January 2015, Hayes confirmed that Meanwhile Gardens would finally be released and it appeared on 23 October 2015.

The four-day event takes place during the last full weekend of September. Activities include livestock and competitive exhibits, pulling contests, craft and commercial tents, various forms of entertainment and a carnival midway. The fairgrounds accommodate both permanent buildings for commercial and agricultural exhibits and space for tents and other non-permanent structures to be brought in each year. Past entertainers on the main stage have included Blake Shelton, Pat Benatar, Justin Moore, George Jones, SHeDAISY, Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn, 38 Special, Charlie Daniels, Phil Vassar, The Guess Who, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Blues Traveler, and KC and the Sunshine Band. The Durham Fair is staffed entirely by volunteers; in fact, it is the second largest fair in North America without paid management or employees. In addition to the members of the Durham Agricultural Fair Association and other volunteers, local organizations such as schools, churches, clubs, civic groups, and more, participate in the fair to help raise funds for their organizations. Pulling contests Pulling contests are events that involve the use of oxen, draft horses and tractors to pull concrete weights to determine the best contestant in each event. They are well received as a show of strength between farmers who believe that their oxen, horses or tractors are the strongest in terms of pulling weight.

The submarine was in service from 17 August 1968 to 31 March 1997.  Construction and commissioning  SSN-639 New Construction Tautog Commissioning The contract to build Tautog was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 30 November 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 27 January 1964. She was commissioned on 15 March 1967, sponsored by Pauline Lafon Gore, wife of United States Senator Albert Gore, Sr. (1907‚Äì1998) of Tennessee. Under sunny skies, a crowd of thousands watched as Mrs. Gore took a hearty swing with a bottle of champagne and intoned the memorial words, \\"In the name of the United States of America, I christen thee Tautog.\\" Tautog was commissioned 17 August 1968 under the command of Commander Buele G. Balderston.  Service history  = 1968‚Äì1970 = On 30 August 1968, Tautog departed Pascagoula on her way to join the United States Pacific Fleet. She transited the Panama Canal on 8 September 1968 and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 23 September 1968. There, she joined Submarine Squadron 12, serving as its flagship. Throughout 1969, Tautog completed her post-commissioning tests and sea trials, followed by her shakedown training cruise. She conducted the majority of these operations in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands, although in January and February 1969 she berthed in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, for trials and repairs. She completed her shakedown training in September 1969 and, on 15 September 1969, began post-shakedown repairs and alterations which were protracted by the necessity of replacing her entire diesel generator. Tautogs repairs finally were completed on 19 February 1970, and she began normal operations out of Pearl Harbor, involving torpedo and sonar tracking exercises, culminating in Tautog earning the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" in 1970 for outstanding performance. Tautog received a Navy Unit Commendation for service on or about 1 June 1969. According to Drew, 2008, Tautog monitored a test of new cruise missiles launched from an Echo II class Soviet submarine in the summer of 1969. Tautog Launch Tautog sailed with the Seventh Fleet (Western Pacific, or WESTPAC) in 1970, making port calls in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Okinawa, Japan and Korea. Upon return to Pearl Harbor, Tautog was presented the Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations conducted during that deployment, 1 October 1970 to 1 April 1971. = Collision with K-108, 1970 = On 20 June 1970, Tautog was patrolling the North Pacific Ocean near the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, on the Soviet Union's Kamchatka Peninsula, which was a major base for missile-armed submarines of the Soviet Navy. Tautog was attempting to trail the K-108, a Soviet Navy Echo II-class guided missile submarine nicknamed \\"Black Lila\\". The Soviet submarine was \\"close aboard\\" with Tautog, unaware that Tautog was in the vicinity, and the two submarines were within feet of one another for a lengthy period. Unable to determine the depth of the K-108, as new depth- finding hydrophones had not yet been installed, the American submarine was at a disadvantage in such close quarters. At some points the hydrographic equipment aboard Tautog registered zero distance between the submarines. At another point \\"Tautog's\\" hydrophone operators assumed the K-108 had risen to near the surface, placing the Soviet submarine directly above Tautog. Then the operators determined the Soviet vessel was descending. The trace on the oscilloscope, that gave the American submariners at visual reference as to the distance of the K-108, disappeared. Just as the captain began to say the Soviet sub was coming close aboard again, K-108 slammed belly first into the top of the Tautog's sail, proof the Soviet vessel had been descending from directly above. The K-108's massive screws came into contact with the steel of the Tautog's sail and lost one screw. This was confirmed by hydrographic sound of a turbine running away aboard the Soviet sub, being no longer coupled to a propeller.\\"Sonntag, Sherry, and Drew, Christopher, Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story Of American Submarine Espionage, p. 146. New York, PublicAffairs Publishers, 1998Tautog suffered damage to her sail. As Tautog proceeded away from the site of the accident, her crew heard what they believed was K-108 breaking up and sinking. When Tautog arrived in Pearl Harbor, a large portion of one of K-108s screws was found embedded in her sail. Over thirty years later, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was revealed that K-108 had actually been able to return to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The former captain of the K-108, Boris Bogdasaryan, was able to provide a concise narrative of the collision. The collision resulted in no casualties aboard either submarine. Tautog sailing into San Francisco Even though the occurrence of this event was adamantly denied by the United States and the Soviet Union, the Tautogs sail was permanently bent at a 2¬∞ angle, which made dry-docking problematic. In 1991, the Chicago Tribune broke the story about the collision. Discovery Channel mentioned it in their TV program Sharks of Steel, and the full details were finally made public in 1999 in the book Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story Of American Submarine Espionage. = 1970‚Äì1977 = On 9 October 1970, Tautog departed Pearl Harbor for her first East Asian deployment. She arrived on station at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 23 October 1970 and joined the United States Seventh Fleet. During her tour of duty in the Western Pacific, she was completely engaged in antisubmarine warfare training, usually with units of the Seventh Fleet but, on one occasion, in a joint operation with the British Royal Navy frigate HMS Aurora (F10). She spent time in port for liberty and repairs at such places as U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in the Philippines; Hong Kong; Yokosuka, Japan; and the South Korean port of Pusan. She concluded her first tour of duty in the Western Pacific on 28 March 1971 when she departed Yokosuka bound for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 5 April 1971 and resumed her routine of upkeep in port alternated with periods at sea engaged in antisubmarine warfare training for the remainder of 1971 and during the first three months of 1972. Tautog in Subic Bay, Philippines On 21 March 1972, Tautog put to sea for a special operation. During that mission, she called briefly at Guam and at Subic Bay. At the conclusion of the assignment, Tautog earned the Navy Unit Commendation for operations conducted during that deployment, 1 June 1972. Tautog made a liberty visit to Hong Kong before returning via Guam to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 31 August 1972. She conducted operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the remainder of 1972. On 15 January 1973, Tautog entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her first regular overhaul. It was completed on 15 April 1974, when she resumed local operations out of Pearl Harbor which ‚Äì except for a voyage to the Pacific Northwest which lasted from late July to early September 1974 ‚Äì occupied her time until the beginning of May 1975. USS Tautog near unnamed city in 1974 On 3 May 1975, she departed Pearl Harbor for another series of special operations in the Central Pacific and Western Pacific. That voyage included a period in drydock at Guam during the first week in June 1975 as well as exercises in the Philippines near Subic Bay. Ports of call once again included Subic Bay and Hong Kong but no South Korean or Japanese ports. Tautog returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 October 1975 and resumed her schedule of training and upkeep. The officers and crew were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for the successful completion of their assigned mission. = 1977‚Äì1980 = Attack submarine training, independent ship's exercises, inspections, and evaluations, all conducted in the Hawaiian Islands operating area, consumed Tautogs energies through the end of 1976. She did not deploy overseas again until the beginning of 1977, when she got underway for a goodwill visit to Mombasa, Kenya. Departing Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1977, she reached Mombasa on 24 January 1977 and remained there for a month while her crew saw the sights and she received visitors on board.  Uganda crisis, 1977  Tautog departed Mombasa on 24 February 1977 and started east toward Pearl Harbor. On the way, however, President of Uganda Idi Amin had precipitated a crisis by rounding up all Americans resident in Uganda in response to President of the United States Jimmy Carter's condemnation of the murders of two of Amin's Ugandan political opponents, and Tautog received orders to join a hastily organized task force built around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and return to the East African coast.. Details the measures taken to conduct a covert rendezvous with Enterprise. While the United States waited for Amin to make his mind up about whether or not to release the American hostages, Tautog cruised the coast of Kenya, which stands between landlocked Uganda and the Indian Ocean, with the Enterprise task force both as a show of American resolve to protect U.S. citizens in Uganda and as a scratch force to try for a hostage rescue if one became necessary. Tautog received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service 1 November 1976 to 5 July 1977. Tautog sailing into Pearl Harbor Amin eventually freed the hostages, and Tautog was released from the special task force and resumed her voyage east, arriving at Guam on 19 March 1977. Tautog visited Chinhae, South Korea, in April and, on 20 April 1977, arrived in Subic Bay for a series of special operations in the Philippines. Early in May 1977, Tautog made a liberty call at Hong Kong and then returned to Subic Bay on the 18 May. Special operations occupied her time in late May and in June. On 3 July 1977, she arrived back at Pearl Harbor and began a customary post-deployment standdown to allow the crew to rest and recuperate. During the 1977 WESTPAC deployment, her crew enjoyed such liberty ports as Mombasa (Kenya), Guam, Chin Hae (South Korea), the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Upon return to Pearl Harbor, preparations were made for the transit to Vallejo, California, where Tautog would undergo its second major overhaul and receive a new reactor core. In December 1977 Tautog entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard and the overhaul commenced. Following completion of the standdown on 8 August 1977, Tautog conducted local operations in the Hawaiian area until she departed Pearl Harbor on 2 December 1977 to proceed to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, for an overhaul. This overhaul, which included the refueling of her nuclear core, lasted nearly fifteen months, after which Tautog successfully completed her sea trials and sailed to Pearl Harbor to rejoin the Submarine Force arriving in July 1979. = 1980‚Äì1997 = Following an intense period of training and operational exercises, Tautog again deployed on WESTPAC in March 1980. Tautog met every commitment placed on her during this period of international tension, and was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for her performance. In September 1980, the ship was awarded the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\", Anti Submarine Warfare \\"A\\" and Engineering \\"E\\" for excellence displayed during the previous year. Port visits to Diego Garcia; the Philippines; Perth, Australia; and Guam were enjoyed by all hands. Tautog also received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service on or around 1 June 1980. Tautog surfaced in Arctic 1981 found the ship and crew rested and ready to go. After a vigorous training cycle, Tautog sailed west once more in support of the Seventh Fleet in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. She became the first nuclear submarine to transit the Malacca Straits, surfaced and visited Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Diego Garcia and Japan. Later in 1982 Tautog earned her third consecutive Engineering \\"E\\" and a Damage Control \\"DC\\" for excellence in Engineering and Damage Control. In winter 1982, Tautog joined one of her sister ships, the , and journeyed to the frozen reaches of the North. She operated beneath the ice pack for two months and conducted a dual surfacing maneuver at the North Pole with USS Aspro. It was said to be the second rendezvous by two U.S. submarines at the pole and the first during winter. During summer 1983, Tautog once again found herself operating under the Arctic ice pack. To celebrate her arrival at the Pole, the crew had a picnic, a tug- of-war and dog sled races \\"around the world\\". right In 1984, following a two- month shipyard availability, Tautog entered a vigorous operational crew training period. In the spring of 1984, Tautog again journeyed west in support of Seventh Fleet operations. Tautog operated extensively in the Northern Pacific, making port visits to the Philippines, Thailand, and Japan. Again, Tautog was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal. Tautog completed a Western Pacific deployment in November 1984 upon her return to Pearl Harbor. After completing a standdown and a post-deployment upkeep period, she hosted prospective commanding officer operations in February 1985 and spent a three- day liberty period at Lahaina, Hawaii, on Maui. Tautog sailing in front of Diamond Head, Hawaii In the summer of 1985 Tautog joined the attack submarine in hosting prospective commanding officer operations. In October 1985, Tautog left Pearl Harbor for a Western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment, visiting Guam; Singapore (for Christmas); Diego Garcia twice; Perth, Australia; the Philippines; and Chinhae, South Korea. On her return to Pearl Harbor Tautog picked up an Operational Reactor Safeguard Examination team. During the Tautog's time in Subic Bay, Ferdinand Marcos was deposed as President of the Philippines and Corazon Aquino was declared the new president. Tautog finished its refit and continued on to finish its WestPac. Once back in Pearl Harbor in April 1986, Tautog had a change of command ceremony in which Commander Walter P. Stuermann relieved Commander T. R. Kent as commanding officer. In October 1986, Tautog began a non-refueling overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. After extensive modifications and testing, Tautog returned to her homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 30 May 1989. Tautog departed on her eighth Western Pacific deployment in May 1990 visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, Subic Bay (Philippines), and Yokosuka, Japan. The ship experienced a massive typhoon which prevented her from entering Subic Bay for almost a week. Back in Pearl Harbor in November 1990, Tautog enjoyed the holidays and began preparing for her third arctic deployment. In April 1991 Tautog once again joined her sister ship, the USS Asprofor three weeks of Arctic under-ice operations, ending in a liberty port in San Francisco. After the exercise, Tautog performed an emergency main ballast tank blow from her test depth. In summer 1991, Tautog hosted the JMSDF submarine Akishio on her mid-Pac cruise. Several members of both crews shared in each other's culture, and some former members of each crew are still in contact. During the 50th- anniversary remembrance observances of 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Empire, Tautog held the honor of being the showcase submarine, hosting many distinguished World War II veterans. In late January 1992, Tautog successfully fired a MK 48 Advanced Capability warshot torpedo and laid the diesel submarine ex-Darter to rest in the deep waters just south of Oahu. Torpedo explodes under Darter In summer 1992, Tautog set sail on a WESTPAC deployment where she pulled back-to-back operations totaling approximately 150 days at sea of the approximate 180-day deployment. In October 1993, Tautog was sent on an emergent WESTPAC with four days notice. The ship and crew participated in a joint exercise with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force, then enjoyed a liberty port in Hong Kong. On 3 October, ET2(SS) Pitcher lost a year of his age when the Tautog sailed across the International Date Line shortly after midnight. This incident is known as: The Great October International Date Line Demarcation Incident. In February 1995, Tautog departed Pearl Harbor for her eleventh WESTPAC deployment conducting joint operations with Japanese, Korean and British naval forces. During this deployment the crew was still able to enjoy such liberty ports as Guam, Hong Kong, Yokosuka (Japan), Sasebo (Japan), Okinawa (Japan), Chinhae (South Korea), and Subic Bay (Philippines). Tautog was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for the highly successful completion of this cruise. Misfortune arrived in February 1996 while the Tautog was conducting a personnel transfer in the mouth of Pearl Harbor. Unusual winds blowing from Maui caught the sail and Tautog drifted off course. While the Officer of the Deck was trying to reposition her, she ran into the west bank of the harbor. The damage was slight ‚Äì cracking the sonar dome ‚Äì but it was still a ship grounding incident and a board of inquiry was launched to determine the root cause of the incident. Tautog decommissioning In July 1996, Tautog departed on her final deployment, this time to the eastern Pacific, supporting weapons testing and weeks of daily Midshipman orientation cruises. Liberty ports included San Diego and Esquimalt (British Columbia), with a repair stop in Bangor, Washington. Tautog made her last dive on Sunday, 13 October 1996, her 1119th dive. Tautogs inactivation ceremony was held on 25 October 1996. After an inactivation period of approximately 6 months, Tautog departed her lifelong homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii for the final time, en route to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for final disposition.  Decommissioning and disposal  Tautog was decommissioned on 31 March 1997 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy's Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton began on 15 March 2003 and was completed on 30 November 2004.

She writes in both Japanese and German. Tawada has won numerous literary awards, including the Akutagawa Prize, the Tanizaki Prize, the Noma Literary Prize, the Izumi Ky≈çka Prize for Literature, the Gunzo Prize for New Writers, the Goethe Medal, the Kleist Prize, and a National Book Award. Early life and education Tawada was born in Nakano, Tokyo. Her father was a translator and bookseller. She attended Tokyo Metropolitan Tachikawa High School. In 1979, at the age of 19, Tawada took the Trans-Siberian Railway to visit Germany. She received her undergraduate education at Waseda University in 1982 with a major in Russian literature, and upon graduation moved to Hamburg, Germany, where she started working with one of her father's business partners in a book distribution business. She left the business to study at Hamburg University, and in 1990 she received a master's degree in contemporary German literature. In 2000 she received her doctorate in German literature from the University of Zurich, where Sigrid Weigel, her thesis advisor, had been appointed to the faculty. In 2006 Tawada moved to Berlin, where she currently resides. Career Tawada's writing career began in 1987 with the publication of Nur da wo du bist da ist nichts‚ÄîAnata no iru tokoro dake nani mo nai (Nothing Only Where You Are), a collection of poems released in a German and Japanese bilingual edition. Her first novella, titled Kakato o nakushite (Missing Heels), received the Gunzo Prize for New Writers in 1991. In 1993 Tawada won the Akutagawa Prize for her novella Inu muko iri, which was published later that year with Kakato o nakushite and another story in the single volume Inu muko iri. Arufabetto no kizuguchi also appeared in book form in 1993, and Tawada received her first major recognition outside of Japan by winning the Lessing Prize Scholarship. An English edition of the three-story collection Inu muko iri, translated by Margaret Mitsutani, was published in 1998 but was not commercially successful. New Directions Publishing reissued the Mitsutani translation of the single Akutagawa Prize-winning novella in 2012 under the title The Bridegroom Was a Dog. Several other books followed, including Seijo densetsu (Legend of a Saint) in 1996 and Futakuchi otoko (The Man With Two Mouths) in 1998. Portions of these books were translated into English by Margaret Mitsutani and collected in a 2009 book titled Facing the Bridge. Tawada won the 1996 Adelbert von Chamisso Prize, a German literary award for non-native speakers of German. In 1997 she was writer in residence at Villa Aurora, and in 1999 she spent four months as the Max Kade Foundation Distinguished Writer-in- Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She won the Izumi Ky≈çka Prize for Literature for her 2000 book Hinagiku no ocha no baai, and both the Sei Ito Literature Prize and the Tanizaki Prize in 2003 for Yogisha no yako ressha (Suspects on the Night Train). Tawada took a bilingual approach to her 2004 novel Das nackte Auge, writing first in German, then in Japanese, and finally producing separate German and Japanese manuscripts. The novel follows a Vietnamese girl who was kidnapped at a young age while in Germany for a youth conference. An English version, translated from the German manuscript by Susan Bernofsky, was published by New Directions Publishing in 2009 under the title The Naked Eye. In 2005, Tawada won the prestigious Goethe Medal from the Goethe-Institut for meritorious contributions to German culture by a non-German. From January to February 2009, she was the Writer-in- Residence at the Stanford University Department of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages. In 2011, inspired by the story of the orphaned polar bear Knut, Tawada wrote three interlocking short stories exploring the relationship between humans and animals from the perspective of three generations of captive polar bears. As with previous work, she wrote separate manuscripts in Japanese and German. In 2011 the Japanese version, titled Yuki no rensh≈´sei, was published in Japan. It won the 2011 Noma Literary Prize and the 2012 Yomiuri Prize. In 2014 the German version, titled Et√ºden im Schnee, was published in Germany. An English edition of Et√ºden im Schnee, translated by Susan Bernofsky, was published by New Directions Publishing in 2016 under the title Memoirs of a Polar Bear. It won the inaugural Warwick Prize for Women in Translation. Tawada won the 2013 Erlanger Prize for her work translating poetry between Japanese and German. In 2014 her novel Kentoshi, a near-future dystopian story of a great-grandfather who grows stronger while his great- grandson grows weaker, was published in Japan. An English version, translated by Margaret Mitsutani, was published in the US by New Directions Publishing in 2018 under the title The Emissary. and as The Last Children of Tokyo by Portobello Books/Granta Books in the UK. In 2016 she received the Kleist Prize, and in 2018 she was awarded the Carl Zuckmayer Medal for services to the German language.  Writing style  Tawada writes in Japanese and German. Scholars of her work have adopted her use of the term exophony to describe the condition of writing in a non-native language. Early in her career Tawada enlisted the help of a translator to produce German editions of her Japanese manuscripts, but later she simultaneously generated separate manuscripts in each language through a process she calls \\"continuous translation.\\" Over time her work has diverged by genre as well as language, with Tawada tending to write longer works such as plays and novels in Japanese, and shorter works such as short stories and essays in German. She also tends to create more neologisms when writing in German than when writing in Japanese. Tawada's writing highlights the strangeness of one language, or particular words in one language, when seen from the perspective of someone who speaks another language. Her writing uses unexpected words, alphabets, and ideograms to call attention to the need for translation in everyday life. She has said that language is not natural but rather \\"artificial and magical,\\" and has encouraged translators of her work to replace word play in her manuscripts with new word play in their own languages. A common theme in Tawada's work is the relationship between words and reality, and in particular the possibility that differences in languages may make assimilation into a different culture impossible. For example, Tawada has suggested that a native Japanese speaker understands different words for \\"pencil\\" in German and Japanese as referring to two different objects, with the Japanese word referring to a familiar pencil and the German word referring to a pencil that is foreign and \\"other.\\" However, her work also challenges the connection between national language and nationalism, particularly the kokugo/kokutai relationship in Japanese culture. Tawada's stories often involve traveling across boundaries. Her writing draws on Tawada's own experiences of traveling between countries and cultures, but it also explores more abstract boundaries, such as the boundary between waking life and dreams, between thoughts and emotions, or between the times before and after a disaster. For example, the main character in her short story \\"Bioskoop der Nacht\\" dreams in a language she does not speak, and must travel to another country to learn the language and understand her own dreams. Tawada's work also employs elements of magical realism, such as the animal and plant anthropomorphism in Memoirs of a Polar Bear, in order to challenge otherwise familiar boundaries, such as the distinction between human and animal. Tawada has cited Paul Celan and Franz Kafka as important literary influences.

Life Auchterlonie was born in Sunderland, County Durham in England. In 1927 when she was 12 years old, her family moved to Australia. Educated in both England and Australia, Auchterlonie went on to study at the University of Sydney, where she completed a first-class honours and then an M.A. in English. During her time there Auchterlonie became a member of an elite group that included the brilliant and flamboyant poet James McAuley, Joan Fraser (who wrote under the pseudonym Amy Witting), Harold Stewart, Oliver Somerville, Alan Crawford and Ronald Dunlop. James McAuley and Harold Stewart were later to become notorious for perpetrating the Ern Malley hoax. The group was described by Peter Coleman in his book on James McAuley, as the 'sourly brilliant literary circle', an oblique reference to Thomas de Quincey. In 1944, Auchterlonie married literary historian and critic, H. M. Green (1881‚Äì1962), who was then the Librarian at the University of Sydney. Auchterlonie worked as an ABC broadcaster and journalist in Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra from 1942 to 1949, and in 1955 became co-principal of a Queensland school. In 1961 she became the first female lecturer at Monash University, lecturing in literature. Her teaching career included positions at both the Australian National University and the Australian Defence Force Academy. During her academic career (1961‚Äì1987) she threw herself into championing Australian literature and publishing literary criticism to re establish authors she felt were undervalued, notably Martin Boyd, E.

His accuracy and ability to hit shot after shot perfectly straight gave him the nickname \\"Pipeline Moe\\". Biography Born in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, in 1929, Norman developed his golf from childhood at the Rockway municipal course in that city, starting as a caddie in his pre- teen years. He refined his skills competing against talented area players such as Gary Cowan and Gerry Kesselring. Norman spent most of his playing career in poverty. He spent many winters setting pins in a bowling alley for a few cents a line. Norman's first win was in 1949, when he won a one-day amateur event at the St. Thomas Golf and Country Club. Norman won back-to-back Canadian Amateur Championships in 1955 and 1956. He turned professional in 1957 and played briefly on the PGA Tour, but due to shyness, bullying he encountered from certain pros, and a preference to stay in Canada, he stayed primarily in Ontario rather than travel extensively outside Canada. In the 80s, Norman also played several events on the Senior PGA Tour. Late in his life, Norman found better financial security when Natural Golf, an instruction company, and Titleist, a major golf manufacturer, signed him to a lifetime contract after he allegedly told a reporter, \\"Titleist never did nothing for me.\\" Moe would often perform golf exhibitions across Canada - Wally Uihlein, president of Titleist considered Moe's lifetime contract a \\"Reverse Scholarship\\". Norman died in 2004 in a Kitchener hospital from congestive heart failure, having suffered from the condition since heart bypass surgery six years earlier. He also had a heart attack two years before his death.  Playing style  Norman was self-taught and never took a golf lesson. Norman's skills as a ball striker are legendary. Sam Snead described Norman as the greatest striker of the ball. In January 2005, Tiger Woods, the biggest golf star of the modern era, told Golf Digest's Jaime Diaz that only two golfers in history have \\"owned their swings\\": Moe Norman and Ben Hogan. Stated Woods, \\"I want to own mine.\\" Norman's play, along with his way of dressing were both unconventional. He wore long-sleeved shirts in any weather, buttoned to his chin, and his pants did‚Äôt fit very well. He devised what is known as \\"The Single Plane Golf Swing\\" ‚Äî- rigid arms extended far from his body, a very wide stance with minimal knee bend, shorter-than-usual backswing and extended follow-through with minimal hand action, which produced amazingly accurate ball placement. He played extremely fast, sometimes not slowing to line up his putts. Norman was known for sometimes unconventional behavior on the course. It is said that on one hole his caddie told him he could get to the green with a driver and a 9-iron. Naturally, he hit off the tee with his 9-iron and then hit the green with his driver. In an exhibition match in 1990 rather than lay up short of a creek hazard which could not be carried, he rolled his drive across the bridge which crossed the creek.

Peter Mikael Englund (born 4 April 1957) is a Swedish author and historian. Englund writes non-fiction books and essays, mainly about history, and especially about the Swedish Empire, but also about other historical events. He writes in a very accessible style, providing narrative details usually omitted in typical books about history. His books have gained popularity and are translated into several languages, such as German and Czech. He was the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy from 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2015, when he was succeeded by Sara Danius. In January 2019 Englund announced that he, and fellow academy member Espmark, would return as active members of the Swedish academy, where they had been inactive since April 2018. Biography Englund was born in Boden and studied a preparatory course for the caring professions for two years and then humanistic subjects for another two years in secondary school. He was then conscripted and served 15 months in the Swedish Army at the Norrbotten Regiment located in Boden. He was politically active in his youth and supported the National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam. Englund studied archaeology, history, and theoretical philosophy at Uppsala University, completing a bachelor's degree in 1983, after which he began doctoral studies in History. He was awarded his Ph.D. in 1989 for his dissertation Det hotade huset (English title in the dissertation abstract: A House in Peril) (1989), an investigation of the worldview of the 17th-century Swedish nobility. During his period as a doctoral student, he had also worked for some time for the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service (\\"MUST\\"), and the year before receiving his doctorate he had published the bestselling Poltava, a detailed description of the Battle of Poltava, where the troops of Swedish king Charles XII were defeated by the Russian army of Tsar Peter I in 1709. Englund has received the August Prize (1993) and the Selma Lagerl√∂f Prize for Literature (2002). He was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 2002. On 1 June 2009, he succeeded Horace Engdahl as the permanent secretary of the Academy. In 2009, perhaps to distance himself from Engdahl, the previous Nobel secretary, Englund, \\"criticized the jury panel as being too \\"Eurocentric,'\\" and \\"told the Associated Press that it was easier for Europeans to relate to European literature\\".Herta M√ºller Wins Nobel Prize in Literature.

On 1 June 2015, Sara Danius succeeded Peter Englund as permanent secretary. On 6 April 2018, Englund announced that he would no longer participate in the Academy's work. On the same day, Klas √ñstergren and Kjell Espmark also declared that they would become inactive members of the Academy. On 10 January 2019, Englund announced on his blog that he and fellow Academy member Kjell Espmark would be returning as active members of the Academy. He stated that continued work to renew the Academy has now reached a point that it must be done from within.

He served as the province's 16th Lieutenant Governor from 1965 to 1970. Bowles had no political experience prior to his appointment as Lt. Governor, and was only the second non-political appointee to the position (James Duncan McGregor was the first, although McGregor had previously worked for the federal government in a non-partisan capacity). Bowles was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and Manitoba Law School. He practiced law from 1937 to 1965, starting his own firm in 1940. He became the first President of Winnipeg's Home and School Association in 1952, and was Chairman of the Winnipeg Board of Parks and Recreation in 1956-57. He was named President of the Manitoba Bar Association in 1961, and also served as President of the Law Society of Manitoba in 1964-65. His appointment as Lt. Governor came in recognition of his legal and community work. The position was primarily ceremonial by this time. Bowles might have been entrusted with determining Manitoba's government after the inclusive 1969 election, but the defection of Liberal MLA Laurent Desjardins to the New Democratic Party made this unnecessary. Bowles returned to private law practice after his term in office ended. In 1969, he presented an essay on Adams George Archibald (the first Lt. Governor of Manitoba) to the Manitoba Historical Society. He later served as Chancellor of the University of Manitoba from 1974 to 1977. In 1972, Bowles campaigned for the federal House of Commons as a Liberal, in the rural riding of Lisgar. Due to the prestige of his former office, there was widespread speculation that he would be appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau if elected. As it happened, however, he lost to Progressive Conservative Jack Murta by 17253 votes to 4469, and did not return to political life thereafter. 1912 births 1988 deaths Lawyers in Manitoba Canadian university and college chancellors Candidates in the 1972 Canadian federal election Lieutenant Governors of Manitoba People from Winnipeg Liberal Party of Canada candidates for the Canadian House of Commons ","title":"Richard Spink Bowles"},{"id":"958722","text":"USS Guitarro (SSN-665), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the guitarro, a ray of the guitarfish family. Guitarro was used as the primary test bed for Tomahawk Cruise Missile testing from 1977 through 1984. Primary GD test conductor was Wiley Huffman. All torpedo tube launches were successful, but flight tests were failures. Following test bed used was USS-705 City of Corpus Christi with Roy Keely as test conductor. All Tomahawk tests completed successfully. Construction and commissioning =Keel-laying and launching= The contract to build Guitarro was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 18 December 1964 and her keel was laid down there on 9 December 1965. She was launched on 27 July 1968, sponsored by Mrs. John M. Taylor, wife of Vice Admiral John Taylor. On 15 March 1969 during a meeting with the shipyard managers, Cmdr. William G. Lange urged them to create centralized control and designate responsibility for all construction. The shipyard representatives dismissed his idea, saying \\"the shipyard had been building ships for a long time without the need for such a procedure and no one had been killed or equipments damaged yet.\\" =Sinking= Guitarro on the bottom of the Napa River after her accidental sinking at Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 15 May 1969. On 15 May 1969, Guitarro was moored in the Napa River at Mare Island Naval Shipyard while construction was still underway. At about 16:00, a civilian nuclear construction group began to calibrate the aft ballast tanks, which required them to fill the tanks with approximately of water. Within 30 minutes, a different, non-nuclear civilian construction group began an assignment to bring Guitarro within a half-degree of trim; this entailed adding water to the forward ballast tanks to overcome a reported two-degree up-bow attitude. Until shortly before 20:00, both groups continued to add water, unaware of each other's activities. Twice between 16:30 and 20:00, a security watch advised the non-nuclear group that Guitarro was riding so low forward that the 1.5-foot-high (0.46 m) wakes of boats operating in the Napa River were sloshing into the sonar dome manhole, but the group ignored the warnings. At 19:45, the non-nuclear group stopped adding water to the ballast tanks and began to halt work for their meal break, leaving at 20:00. At 19:50, the nuclear group completed their calibrations and began to empty the tanks aft. At 20:30, both the nuclear group, still aboard, and the non-nuclear group, returning from their break, noticed Guitarro taking a sudden down angle which put the forward hatches underwater. Massive flooding took place through several large open hatches. Efforts between 20:30 and 20:45 to close watertight doors and hatches were largely unsuccessful because lines and cables ran through the doors and hatches, preventing them from closing. At 20:55, Guitarro sank, leaving only her sail above water, earning her the nickname \\"Mare Island Mud Puppy\\". = Causes= In an attempt to correct what they thought was an out of trim condition, the non-nuclear construction team in the forward part of the boat purposefully defeated safety measures preventing accidentally filling ballast tanks while the sub was under construction. During construction, steel plates are welded over the ballast tanks flood ports to prevent water from getting into the tanks and putting the submarine in an unsafe condition. The construction crew put a fire hose down the tank's vent pipe and forced it past the check valve. The Congressional report concluded that the sinking was caused in large part by \\"the action, or inaction, of certain construction workers who either failed to recognize an actual or potential threat to the ship's safety or assumed that it was not their responsibility.\\" The report stated that the \\"lack of centralized control and responsibility for all construction\\" was the overriding cause. Sinking of USS Guitarro (SSN-665) One of the factors contributing to the ship's sinking was the open manhole used to access the bow structure sonar dome containing the boat's sonar sphere. The manhole has a bolted cover which had been removed for maintenance purposes. The opening was protected by a cofferdam approximately high. The cofferdam was intended to prevent water from accidentally entering the dome and contacting the exposed electronic gear.Guitarro II (SSN-665) 1972‚Äì1994 To facilitate repair work, the cofferdam and the bolted manhole cover were removed in early March 1969 and neither the cofferdam nor the cover was ever replaced. When the construction crews added and then removed water from the ballast tanks, affecting the boat's trim, the manhole was exposed to waves caused by the wake of other vessels, causing the boat to sink at the bow, eventually filling the entire submarine. = Refloating= Guitarro was refloated three days later, on 18 May 1969. Damages to her were estimated at $15.2 to $21.85 million (equivalent to $ to $ million in ). = Lessons learned= Among other recommendations affecting communication, management, and supervision of ship construction, the report authors recommended that cables and lines running through watertight hatches and doors be equipped with quick disconnect fittings. =Commissioning= Guitarro had been scheduled to be commissioned in January 1970, but repairs necessitated by her sinking dictated a 32-month delay. She finally was commissioned on 9 September 1972 with Commander Gordon Lange in command. Service history In the mid-to-late 1970s, Guitarro was stationed at Point Loma in San Diego, California, commanded by Alvin H. Pauole, followed by Scott Van Hoften. She was active at the time in the pre-operational testing of the new Tomahawk cruise missile, launching several of the missiles on a test range off the coast of Southern California. Guitarro was used as the primary test bed for Tomahawk Cruise Missile testing from 1977 through 1984. Primary GD test conductor was Wiley Huffman. All torpedo tube launches were successful, but flight tests were failures. Following test bed used was USS-705 City of Corpus Christi with Roy Keely as test conductor. All Tomahawk tests completed successfully.

He was a founder and long-time chairman of the National States' Rights Party as well as the publisher of its newsletter, The Thunderbolt. Stoner unsuccessfully attempted to run as a Democrat for several political offices in order to promote his white supremacist agenda. Early life Stoner's family ran a sight-seeing company on Lookout Mountain, Georgia, and in nearby Chattanooga. At age two, he contracted childhood polio, which impaired one of his legs and resulted in a lifelong limp. His father Jesse Benjamin Stoner Sr., died when he was five; his mother Minnie died when he was 17. Stoner admired segregationist politician Theodore G. Bilbo. He became active in white supremacist groups and traveled to Washington, D.C. to support Bilbo. Education Stoner rechartered a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in Chattanooga when he was 18 years old. Stoner once said that \\"being a Jew [should] be a crime punishable by death.\\" He ran the National States' Rights Party, founded by Edward Reed Fields, an associate of Stoner's, which attracted such fringe political figures as Addison Roswell Thompson, a perennial Democratic candidate for governor of Louisiana and mayor of New Orleans. Stoner earned a law degree, and served as the attorney for James Earl Ray. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also considered Stoner to be a suspect in the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and in several bombings of synagogues and black churches during the 1950s and 1960s, such as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Career As a \\"roving white supremacist,\\" Stoner, along with Connie Lynch, was present in Bogalusa, Louisiana in 1965, \\"with the same road show they used to inflame white mobs in St. Augustine during the summer of 1964. Standing on a platform in Bogalusa, Stoner said: > The nigger is not a human being. He is somewhere between the white man and > the ape. We don't believe in tolerance. We don't believe in getting along > with our enemy, and the nigger is our enemy. Every time a nigger gets a job, > that's just one more job that you can't have. You notice the niggers are > singing 'I Love Everybody.' They sure do love everybody, and especially our > white women. What the nigger really wants is our white women. Stoner ran for governor of Georgia in 1970. During the campaign, where he called himself the \\"candidate of love,\\" he described Adolf Hitler as \\"too moderate,\\" black people as an extension of the ape family, and Jews as \\"vipers of hell.\\" The primary was won by civil rights supporter, and future President, Jimmy Carter. Stoner then ran for the United States Senate in 1972, finishing fifth in the Democratic Party primary with just over 40,000 votes. The nomination and election went to Sam Nunn. During his Senate campaign, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that television stations had to play his ads because of the fairness doctrine. His ads included the word \\"nigger.\\" Stoner also ran for lieutenant governor in 1974 and the US Senate in 1980. His best showing was 73,000 votes (10%) in his campaign for lieutenant governor in 1974, when he sought to succeed Lester G. Maddox in Georgia's second- highest constitutional office. Maddox lost the gubernatorial nomination that year to former legislator George D. Busbee. In his 1974 campaign for lieutenant governor, Stoner placed signs on the Macon Transit Company buses, which Mayor Ronnie Thompson ordered to be removed. Stoner promptly went to federal court to secure the return of his paid signs under his First Amendment protection. He urged, tongue-in-cheek, Georgia blacks to support his nemesis, Thompson, for governor. Stoner polled more votes for lieutenant governor than were cast for all four candidates in the Republican gubernatorial primary, which Thompson had only barely won.

The plasma membranes of cells contain combinations of glycosphingolipids, cholesterol and protein receptors organised in glycolipoprotein lipid microdomains termed lipid rafts. Their existence in cellular membranes remains somewhat controversial. It has been proposed that they are specialized membrane microdomains which compartmentalize cellular processes by serving as organising centers for the assembly of signaling molecules, allowing a closer interaction of protein receptors and their effectors to promote kinetically favorable interactions necessary for the signal transduction. Lipid rafts influence membrane fluidity and membrane protein trafficking, thereby regulating neurotransmission and receptor trafficking. Lipid rafts are more ordered and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer, but float freely within the membrane bilayer. Although more common in the cell membrane, lipid rafts have also been reported in other parts of the cell, such as the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes.  Properties  Space-filling models of sphingomyelin (a) and cholesterol (b) One key difference between lipid rafts and the plasma membranes from which they are derived is lipid composition. Research has shown that lipid rafts contain 3 to 5-fold the amount of cholesterol found in the surrounding bilayer. Also, lipid rafts are enriched in sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin, which is typically elevated by 50% compared to the plasma membrane. To offset the elevated sphingolipid levels, phosphatidylcholine levels are decreased which results in similar choline-containing lipid levels between the rafts and the surrounding plasma membrane. Cholesterol interacts preferentially, although not exclusively, with sphingolipids due to their structure and the saturation of the hydrocarbon chains. Although not all of the phospholipids within the raft are fully saturated, the hydrophobic chains of the lipids contained in the rafts are more saturated and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer. Cholesterol is the dynamic \\"glue\\" that holds the raft together. Due to the rigid nature of the sterol group, cholesterol partitions preferentially into the lipid rafts where acyl chains of the lipids tend to be more rigid and in a less fluid state. One important property of membrane lipids is their amphipathic character. Amphipathic lipids have a polar, hydrophilic head group and a non-polar, hydrophobic region. The figure to the right shows the inverted cone-like shape of sphingomyelin and the cone-like shape of cholesterol based on the area of space occupied by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Cholesterol can pack in between the lipids in rafts, serving as a molecular spacer and filling any voids between associated sphingolipids. Rietveld & Simons related lipid rafts in model membranes to the immiscibility of ordered (Lo phase) and disordered (Ld or LŒ± phase) liquid phases. The cause of this immiscibility is uncertain, but the immiscibility is thought to minimize the free energy between the two phases. Studies have shown there is a difference in thickness of the lipid rafts and the surrounding membrane which results in hydrophobic mismatch at the boundary between the two phases. This phase height mismatch has been shown to increase line tension which may lead to the formation of larger and more circular raft platforms to minimize the energetic cost of maintaining the rafts as a separate phase. Other spontaneous events, such as curvature of the membrane and fusing of small rafts into larger rafts, can also minimize line tension. By one early definition of lipid rafts, lipid rafts differ from the rest of the plasma membrane. In fact, researchers have hypothesized that the lipid rafts can be extracted from a plasma membrane. The extraction would take advantage of lipid raft resistance to non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-100 or Brij-98 at low temperatures (e.g., 4 ¬∞C). When such a detergent is added to cells, the fluid membrane will dissolve while the lipid rafts may remain intact and could be extracted. Because of their composition and detergent resistance, lipid rafts are also called detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes (GEMs) or DIGs or Detergent Resistant Membranes (DRMs). However the validity of the detergent resistance methodology of membranes has recently been called into question due to ambiguities in the lipids and proteins recovered and the observation that they can also cause solid areas to form where there were none previously.  Function  Mediation of substrate presentation. Lipid rafts localize palmitoylated proteins away from the disordered region of the plasma membrane. Disruption of palmitate mediated localization then allows for exposure of a protein to its binding partner or substrate in the disordered region, an activation mechanism termed substrate presentation. For example, a protein is often palmitoylated and binds 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2). PIP2 is polyunsaturated and does not reside in lipid rafts. When the levels of PIP2 increase in the plasma membrane the protein trafficks to PIP2 clusters where it can be activated directly by PIP2 or another molecule that associates with PIP2. It is probable that other functions exist.  History  Until 1982, it was widely accepted that phospholipids and membrane proteins were randomly distributed in cell membranes, according to the Singer-Nicolson fluid mosaic model, published in 1972. However, membrane microdomains were postulated in the 1970s using biophysical approaches by Stier & Sackmann and Klausner & Karnovsky. These microdomains were attributed to the physical properties and organization of lipid mixtures by Stier & Sackmann and Israelachvili et al. In 1974, the effects of temperature on membrane behavior had led to the proposal of \\"clusters of lipids\\" in membranes and by 1975, data suggested that these clusters could be \\"quasicrystalline\\" regions within the more freely dispersed liquid crystalline lipid molecule. In 1978, X-Ray diffraction studies led to further development of the \\"cluster\\" idea defining the microdomains as \\"lipids in a more ordered state\\". Karnovsky and co-workers formalized the concept of lipid domains in membranes in 1982. Karnovsky's studies showed heterogeneity in the lifetime decay of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, which indicated that there were multiple phases in the lipid environment of the membrane. One type of microdomain is constituted by cholesterol and sphingolipids. They form because of the segregation of these lipids into a separate phase, demonstrated by Biltonen and Thompson and their coworkers. These microdomains (‚Äòrafts‚Äô) were shown to exist also in cell membranes. Later, Kai Simons at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Germany and Gerrit van Meer from the University of Utrecht, Netherlands refocused interest on these membrane microdomains, enriched with lipids and cholesterol, glycolipids, and sphingolipids, present in cell membranes. Subsequently, they called these microdomains, lipid \\"rafts\\". The original concept of rafts was used as an explanation for the transport of cholesterol from the trans Golgi network to the plasma membrane. The idea was more formally developed in 1997 by Simons and Ikonen. At the 2006 Keystone Symposium of Lipid Rafts and Cell Function, lipid rafts were defined as \\"small (10-200nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein interactions\\" In recent years, lipid raft studies have tried to address many of the key issues that cause controversy in this field, including the size and lifetime of rafts. Other questions yet to be answered include: *What are the effects of membrane protein levels? *What is the physiological function of lipid rafts? *What effect does flux of membrane lipids have on raft formation? *What effect do diet and drugs have on lipid rafts? *What effect do proteins located at raft boundaries have on lipid rafts? Common types Two types of lipid rafts have been proposed: planar lipid rafts (also referred to as non-caveolar, or glycolipid, rafts) and caveolae. Planar rafts are defined as being continuous with the plane of the plasma membrane (not invaginated) and by their lack of distinguishing morphological features. Caveolae, on the other hand, are flask shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that contain caveolin proteins and are the most readily-observed structures in lipid rafts. Caveolins are widely expressed in the brain, micro-vessels of the nervous system, endothelial cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia and hippocampal neurons. Planar rafts contain flotillin proteins and are found in neurons where caveolae are absent. Both types have similar lipid composition (enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids). Flotillin and caveolins can recruit signaling molecules into lipid rafts, thus playing an important role in neurotransmitter signal transduction. It has been proposed that these microdomains spatially organize signaling molecules to promote kinetically favorable interactions which are necessary for signal transduction. Conversely, these microdomains can also separate signaling molecules, inhibiting interactions and dampening signaling responses.  Role in signal transduction  The specificity and fidelity of signal transduction are essential for cells to respond efficiently to changes in their environment. This is achieved in part by the differential localization of proteins that participate in signalling pathways. In the plasma membrane, one approach of compartmentalization utilizes lipid rafts. One reasonable way to consider lipid rafts is that small rafts can form concentrating platforms after ligand binding activation for individual receptors. Lipid rafts have been found by researchers to be involved in many signal transduction processes, such as Immunoglobulin E signalling, T cell antigen receptor signalling, B cell antigen receptor signalling, EGF receptor signalling, insulin receptor signalling and so on. In order to illustrate these principles, detailed examples of signalling pathways that involve lipid rafts are described below. = Epidermal growth factor signaling = Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds to EGF receptor, also known as HER-1 or ErbB1, to initiate transmembrane signaling. Lipid rafts have been suggested to play a bipartite role in this process. Certain aspects of lipid rafts inhibit EGF receptor function: * the ganglioside component of lipid rafts was shown to inhibit receptor activation * the membrane dipole potential, which was shown to be higher in lipid rafts than in the rest of the membrane, was demonstrated to inhibit EGF binding to its receptor * EGF binding was shown to be inhibited by non-caveolar lipid rafts due to a decrease in the number of receptors available for ligand binding * EGF and ErbB2 (HER-2) were shown to migrate out of lipid rafts or caveolae during or after activation * disruption of lipid rafts was shown to induce ligand-independent activation of EGF receptor At the same time lipid rafts seem to be necessary for or potentiate transmembrane signaling: * sequestration of ErbB2 from lipid rafts have been shown to inhibit EGF-induced signaling * the membrane dipole potential, which is higher in lipid rafts than in the rest of the membrane, potentiates EGF-induced signaling * EGF was shown to bring about coalescence of individual lipid rafts, similar to what has been suggested to play a role in the activation of the T-cell receptor * localization of EGF receptor to lipid rafts induces resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors = Immunoglobulin E signaling = Components for IgE signalling IgE signalling process Immunoglobulin E (IgE) signaling is the first convincingly demonstrated lipid rafts involving signaling process. Evidence for this fact includes decreased solubility of Fc-epsilon receptors (FcŒµR) in Triton X-100 from steady state to crosslinking state, formation of patches large enough to be visualized by fluorescence microscopy from gangliosides and GPI-anchored proteins, abolition of IgE signaling by surface cholesterol depletion with methyl-Œ≤-cyclodextrin and so on. This signaling pathway can be described as follows: IgE first binds to Fc-epsilon receptors (FcŒµR) residing in the plasma membrane of mast cells and basophils through its Fc segment. FcŒµR is a tetramer consist of one Œ±, one Œ≤ and two Œ≥ chains. It is monomeric and binds one IgE molecule. The Œ± chain binds IgE and the other three chains contain immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM). Then oligomeric antigens bind to receptor-bound IgE to crosslink two or more of these receptors. This crosslinking then recruits doubly acylated non- receptor Src-like tyrosine kinase Lyn to phosphorylate ITAMs. After that, Syk family tyrosine kinases bind these phosphotyrosine residues of ITAMs to initiate the signaling cascade. Syk can, in turn, activate other proteins such as LAT. Through crosslinking, LAT can recruit other proteins into the raft and further amplify the signal. = T-cell antigen receptor signaling = Components for T-cell antigen receptor signalling T-cell antigen receptor signalling process T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a molecule found on the surface of T lymphocytes (T cells). It is composed of Œ±Œ≤-heterodimers, CD3 (Œ≥Œ¥Œµ) complex and Œæ-homodimer. The Œ±- and Œ≤- subunits contains extracellular binding sites for peptides that are presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II proteins on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). The CD3 and Œæ- subunits contain cytoplasmic ITAM motifs. During the signaling process, MHCs binding to TCRs brings two or more receptors together. This crosslinking, similar to IgE signaling, then recruit doubly acylated non-receptor Src-like tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate ITAM tyrosine residues. In addition to recruiting Lyn, TCR signaling also recruits Fyn. Following this procedure, ZAP-70 (which is also different with IgE signalling) binds to phosphorylated ITAMs, which leads to its own activation and LAT activation. LAT activation is the source of signal amplification. Another difference between IgE and T cell antigen receptor signalling is that Lck activation by TCR could result in more severe raft clustering thus more signal amplification. One possible mechanism of down-regulating this signaling involves the binding of cytosolic kinase Csk to the raft associated protein CBP. Csk may then suppress the Src-family kinases through phosphorylation. = B-cell antigen receptor signaling = B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a complex between a membrane bound Ig (mIg) molecule and a disulfide-linked IgŒ±- IgŒ≤ heterodimer of two polypeptides. IgŒ± and IgŒ≤ each contains an amino acid motif, called ITAM, whose sequence is D/ExxYxxL/Ix7YxxL/I. The process of B cell antigen receptor signalling is similar to Immunoglobulin E signalling and T-cell antigen receptor signalling. It is commonly believed that other than BCR, lipid rafts play an important role in many of the cell surface events involved in B cell activation. Their functions include signaling by BCR, modulation of that signaling by co-receptors, signaling by CD40, endocytosis of antigen bound to the BCR and its routing to late endosomes to facilitate loading of antigen-derived peptides onto class II MHC molecules, routing of those peptide/MHC-II complexes to the cell surface, and their participation in antigen presentation to T cells.  As platforms for virus entry  Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, have to involve specific interaction of virus and cellular receptor expressed at the plasma membrane in order to enter cells. Accumulated evidence supports that viruses enter cells via penetration of specific membrane microdomains, including lipid rafts. = Nonenveloped virus = The best studied models of lipid rafts-related nonenveloped viral entry are simian virus 40 (SV40, Papovaviridae) and echovirus type 1 (EV1, Picornaviridae). SV40 utilizes two different receptors to bind onto cell surface: ganglioside GM1 located in lipid rafts and major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecule. Binding of SV40 with MHC class I molecules triggers receptor clustering and redistribution. SV40 may recruit more caveolae from the cytoplasm or even new caveolae formed at the site of entry. A cascade of virus-induced signaling events triggered by attachment results in caveolae- mediated endocytosis in about 20 min. In some cell types the virus can enter the caveosomes directly from lipid rafts in non-coated vesicles. EV1 uses Œ±2Œ≤1-integrin as cellular receptor. Multiple integrin heterodimers can bind to the adjacent sites of the virus capsid. Similar to SV40, attachment and binding with cells triggers clustering and relocation of integrin molecules from lipid rafts to the caveolae-like structures. Depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts inhibits EV1 infection. There are also viruses that use the non- caveolar raft-mediated endocytosis, such as Echovirus 11 (EV11, picornavirus). However, detailed mechanisms still need to be further characterized. = Enveloped virus = Influenza viruses bind to the cellular receptor sialic acid, which links to glycoconjugate on the cell surface, to initiate endocytosis. After transportation into late endosomes, low-pH-dependent conformation changes of HA induces fusion, and viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) are released by proton influx of viral ion channel M2 proteins that requires binding with cholesterol. Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SIN) require cholesterol and sphingolipids in target membrane lipid rafts for envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion and entry. Human T-lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-1) enter cells via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1). Ebola virus and Marburg virus use folate receptor-Œ± (FRŒ±), which is a GPI-anchored protein, as a cellular receptor. Hepatitis B virus recognizes human complement receptor type 2 (CR2, or known as CD21). Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) binds to human CD46 on host cell surface. All these viral receptors are located in lipid rafts or would be relocated into lipid rafts after infection. Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as a sexually-transmitted animal virus, must first penetrate a barrier of epithelial cells, who don‚Äôt express CD4 and chemokine receptors, to establish a productive infection. An alternative receptor for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein on epithelial cells is glycosphingolipid galactosyl-ceramide (GalCer), which enriches at lipid raft.  Visualization  One of the primary reasons for the controversy over lipid rafts has stemmed from the challenges of studying lipid rafts in living cells, which are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Lipid rafts are small microdomains ranging from 10‚Äì200 nm in size. Due to their size being below the classical diffraction limit of a light microscope, lipid rafts have proved difficult to visualize directly. Currently synthetic membranes are studied; however, there are many drawbacks to using these membranes. First, synthetic membranes have a lower concentration of proteins compared to biomembranes. Also, it is difficult to model membrane-cytoskeletal interactions which are present in biomembranes. Other pitfalls include lack of natural asymmetry and inability to study the membranes in non-equilibrium conditions. Despite this, fluorescence microscopy is used extensively in the field. For example, fluorophores conjugated to cholera-toxin B-subunit, which binds to the raft constituent ganglioside GM1 is used extensively. Also used are lipophilic membrane dyes which either partition between rafts and the bulk membrane, or change their fluorescent properties in response to membrane phase. Laurdan is one of the prime examples of such a dye. Rafts may also be labeled by genetic expression of fluorescent fusion proteins such as Lck-GFP. Manipulation of cholesterol is one of the most widely used techniques for studying lipid rafts. Sequestration (using filipin, nystatin or amphotericin), depletion and removal (using methyl-B-cyclodextrin) and inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are ways cholesterol are manipulated in lipid raft studies. These studies allow for the observations of effects on neurotransmitter signaling upon reduction of cholesterol levels. Sharma and colleagues used combination of high resolution imaging and mathematical modeling to provide the view that raft proteins are organized into high density nanoclusters with radii ranging over 5‚Äì20 nm. Using measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the same probes (homo-FRET or fluorescence anisotropy), Sharma and colleagues reported that a fraction (20‚Äì40%) of GPI-anchored proteins are organized into high density clusters of 4‚Äì5 nm radius, each consisting of a few molecules and different GPI-anchored proteins. To combat the problems of small size and dynamic nature, single particle and molecule tracking using cooled, sensitive CCD cameras and total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy is coming to prominence. This allows information of the diffusivity of particles in the membrane to be extracted as well as revealing membrane corrals, barriers and sites of confinement. Other optical techniques are also used: Fluorescence Correlation and Cross- Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) can be used to gain information of fluorophore mobility in the membrane, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) can detect when fluorophores are in close proximity and optical tweezer techniques can give information on membrane viscosity. Not only optical techniques, but also scanning probe techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) or Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) can be used to detect the topological and mechanical properties of synthetic lipids or native cell membranes isolated by cell unroofing. Also used are dual polarisation interferometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) although fluorescence microscopy remains the dominant technique. In the future it is hoped that super-resolution microscopy such as Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) or various forms of structured illumination microscopy may overcome the problems imposed by the diffraction limit. Other techniques used in the analysis of lipid rafts include ELISA, western blotting, and FACS.  Controversy  The role of rafts in cellular signaling, trafficking, and structure has yet to be determined despite many experiments involving several different methods, and their very existence is controversial despite all the above. Arguments against the existence of lipid rafts include the following: * First, a line tension should exist between the LŒ± and Lo phases. This line has been seen in model membranes, but has not been readily observed in cell systems. * Second, there is no consensus on lipid raft size, which has been reported anywhere between 1 and 1,000 nanometers. * Third, the time scale of lipid raft existence is unknown. If lipid rafts exist, they may only occur on a time scale that is irrelevant to biological processes. * Fourth, the entire membrane may exist in the Lo phase. A first rebuttal to this point suggests that the Lo phase of the rafts is more tightly packed due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding exhibited between sphingolipids and cholesterol that is not seen elsewhere. A second argument questions the effectiveness of the experimental design when disrupting lipid rafts. Pike and Miller discuss potential pitfalls of using cholesterol depletion to determine lipid raft function. They noted that most researchers were using acute methods of cholesterol depletion, which disrupt the rafts, but also disrupt another lipid known as PI(4,5)P2. PI(4,5)P2 plays a large role in regulating the cell‚Äôs cytoskeleton, and disrupting PI(4,5)P2 causes many of the same results as this type of cholesterol depletion, including lateral diffusion of the proteins in the membrane. Because the methods disrupt both rafts and PI(4,5)P2, Kwik et al. concluded that loss of a particular cellular function after cholesterol depletion cannot necessarily be attributed solely to lipid raft disruption, as other processes independent of rafts may also be affected. Finally, while lipid rafts are believed to be connected in some way to proteins, Edidin argues that proteins attract the lipids in the raft by interactions of proteins with the acyl chains on the lipids, and not the other way around.

He served as general manager of Security Storage Limited (a family business) from 1952 until his appointment in 1970. He also established the McKeag-Harris Reality and Development company in 1960. In 1958, McKeag ran for the Manitoba legislature as a Liberal-Progressive candidate in the upscale Winnipeg riding of River Heights. This was the year in which Dufferin Roblin's Progressive Conservatives ended forty-three years of Liberal and Progressive rule, and McKeag was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate W.B. Scarth. From 1966 to 1969, McKeag was a councilor in the town of Tuxedo, prior to its merger with Winnipeg. He was also chairman of the Greater Winnipeg Election Committee from 1968 to 1970. McKeag, at the age of 42, was the youngest Lieutenant Governor in Manitoba's history when he was appointed by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau in 1970. However, the office of Lieutenant Governor is a ceremonial post, and he had almost no practical influence over the government of Edward Schreyer. McKeag was appointed Honorary Colonel of The Fort Garry Horse on 26 June 1973 and held the appointment until 22 January 2000.

He is considered an important figure in the Latin American \\"Boom\\" generation, and received several awards, including the Prince of Asturias Award in Literature (2000), Miguel √Ångel Asturias National Prize in Literature (1997), and Juan Rulfo Award (1996).Augusto Monterroso Bonilla. Juchimanes de Plata . Life Monterroso was born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to a Honduran mother and Guatemalan father. In 1936 his family settled definitively in Guatemala City, where he would remain until early adulthood. Here he published his first short stories and began his clandestine work against the dictatorship of Jorge Ubico. To this end he founded the newspaper El Espectador with a group of other writers. He was detained and exiled to Mexico City in 1944 for his opposition to the dictatorial regime. Shortly after his arrival in Mexico, the revolutionary government of Jacobo Arbenz triumphed in Guatemala, and Monterroso was assigned to a minor post in the Guatemalan embassy in Mexico. In 1953 he moved briefly to Bolivia upon being named Guatemalan consul in La Paz. He relocated to Santiago de Chile in 1954, when Arbenz's government was toppled with help from an American intervention. In 1956 he returned definitively to Mexico City, where he would occupy various academic and editorial posts and continue his work as a writer for the rest of his life.CVC. Augusto Monterroso In 1988, Augusto Monterroso received the highest honor the Mexican government can bestow on foreign dignitaries, the √Åguila Azteca. He was also awarded the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award, in 2000. In 1997, Monterroso was awarded the Guatemala National Prize in Literature for his body of work. He died due to heart failure at the age of 81, in Mexico City.\\"Recordando a Augusto Monterroso\\". Proceso, 11 February 2003. Work Although Monterroso limited himself almost exclusively to the short story form, he is widely considered a central figure in the Latin American \\"Boom\\" generation, which was best known for its novelists. As such he is recognized alongside such canonical authors as Julio Cort√°zar, Carlos Fuentes, Juan Rulfo and Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. Save for Lo dem√°s es silencio (\\"The Rest is Silence\\"), his foray into the form of the novel, Monterroso only published short pieces. He worked throughout his career to perfect the short story form, often delving into analogous genres (most famously the fable) for stylistic and thematic inspiration. Even Lo dem√°s es silencio, however, largely eschews the traditional novelistic form, opting instead for the loose aggregation of various apocryphal short texts (newspaper clippings, testimonials, diary entries, poems) to sketch the \\"biography\\" of its fictional main character. Monterroso also was known for popularizing short stories and was the author of what is often credited to be one of the world's shortest stories, \\"El Dinosaurio\\" (\\"The Dinosaur\\"), published in Obras completas (Y otros cuentos). The story reads, in its entirety: : Cuando despert√≥, el dinosaurio todav√≠a estaba all√≠. : (\\"When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.\\") Carlos Fuentes wrote of Monterroso (referring specifically to The Black Sheep and Other Fables): \\"Imagine Borges' fantastical bestiary having tea with Alice. Imagine Jonathan Swift and James Thurber exchanging notes. Imagine a frog from Calaveras County who has seriously read Mark Twain. Meet Monterroso.\\"The Black Sheep and Other Fables, trans.

She was a prominent Winnipeg-area municipal politician from 1969 to 1981, and served as the province's 19th Lieutenant Governor from October 23, 1981 to December 11, 1986. She was the first woman to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and only the second woman to serve as a viceroy in Canadian history, after Pauline McGibbon of Ontario. McGonigal was born in Melville, Saskatchewan. Before entering politics, she spent nine years in the banking sector and seven as a merchandising representative. McGonigal was elected to the city council of St. James-Assiniboia in 1969, two years before its amalgamation with Winnipeg. Following amalgamation, she served on the Greater City Council from 1971 to 1981, and was the city's Deputy Mayor from 1979 to 1981. Throughout her time on council, she was a member of the Independent Citizens' Election Committee, an unofficial alliance of right-wing and pro-development interest groups in the city (McGonigal's husband was a prominent Winnipeg-area developer). McGonigal was appointed Lt. Governor of Manitoba by Governor General Edward Schreyer, on the advice of Pierre Trudeau, in 1981. The office was essentially a ceremonial post by this time, and McGonigal had little if any practical influence over the government of Howard Pawley during her time in office. She was notable, however, as the first woman in Manitoba (and only the second in Canada) to hold such a position. McGonigal has also worked as the Manitoba chair of the Council for Canadian Unity. She was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1994 and the Order of Manitoba in 2000. In 2003, she received the President's Award from the Winnipeg Press Club. She is a gourmet cook that has written regular columns on the subject in Winnipeg's daily and community newspapers.https://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/media/mcgonigal1983.pdf Also during the early 2000s, McGonigal served as Chairman of the Canadian Forces Liaison Council in Manitoba, which regularly lobbies public bodies and private businesses to grant time off to military reservists for training purposes.

The show was created by Woody Thompson and Tad Low and premiered October 27, 1996. For a time, it was the highest-rated program on VH1, though Behind the Music overtook it by 1998. It was originally produced by Spin the Bottle Inc., and later by Eyeboogie Inc. during its original run. In October 2011, Pop Up Video was revived by VH1, featuring new videos with new trivia and commentary. The revived production was continued by Eyeboogie Inc. The show's pioneering use of pop-up bubbles to provide additional information about what is happening onscreen has seen many imitators and parodies, as well as some official licensed spinoffs, including Pop Up Video UK. Format Most episodes of Pop Up Video play four or five music videos each, selected to include new, older, \\"classic\\", and \\"campy\\" videos. The bubbles that pop up in each video generally appear about every 10‚Äì15 seconds; their content is divided between information about the recording artist featured, the production of the video, and random facts inspired by the theme or content of the video. One of the show's staff writers is assigned to each video. Production costs for each episode total about $30,000. The \\"random\\" information presented in bubbles frequently included statistics and demographics, medical, scientific, and historical trivia, definitions, and lists of a wide range of subjects. Gary Burns, in the Journal of Popular Film and Television, also notes as a recurring theme \\"the producers' attempt to turn practically every popped-up video into a dirty joke.\\" Often the film crew for the video in question would be interviewed in the research process; everyone from the director to make-up artists, choreographers, models, and extras might be used as sources. In addition, the producers solicited information by means of a phone line (displayed during the closing credits) and web site page. General facts are double- or triple- sourced, according to the producers. History Thompson and Low previously worked together on Brandon Tartikoff's late night talk show Last Call, before it was cancelled in 1994. They spent the next two years making pitches of ideas for television shows to various networks; in late 1995, the original iteration of the show concept, titled Pop Up Videos, was sent to VH1 executives, alongside a number of other concepts making use of aspects of songs or music videos. The pilot episode cost $3000 to produce; the first video to be played on the show was Tina Turner's \\"Missing You\\". 1997 saw Pop Up Video's profile expand as popular news publications such as The New York Times, Newsweek, and Entertainment Weekly all produced articles about the show. A number of published articles are described here as mirrored on the official Pop Up Video web site at the time; however, the Internet Archive apparently did not archive these URLs. In 2000, Entertainment Weekly reported that Low was no longer involved with the production of the show. Specials and other versions Special episodes of Pop Up Video aired throughout the series' run. Many focused on specific artists, including VH1 staples Madonna, Culture Club, U2, Prince, and Elton John. Others ran on different themes, such as \\"Women First,\\" \\"Road Trip,\\" \\"Movies,\\" and \\"Duets\\". There were also several holiday specials, including Halloween and several Christmas episodes. Some theme episodes broke with the show's format by including a montage of clips from many videos.The \\"Madonna III\\" episode included 15 different videos. During a week of 1980s-themed programming on VH1 in March 1998, Pop Up Video became Pop Up '80s. These episodes featured additional clips of 1980s news events and pop culture tidbits between music videos. The 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Divas Live, The Oprah Winfrey Show (aired in syndication), several episodes of the Brady Bunch (aired on Nick at Nite in 2001, effectively named \\"Pop Up Brady\\"), ABC's Original TGIF 1998 and 1999 line-up's season premieres and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (December 2000) also got the Pop Up treatment. Other proposals, such as a Pop Up Video edition of the entirety of Grease during its 1998 theatrical re-release, were never realized. However, The music video for the 1998 single \\"The Grease Megamix\\" was featured on the \\"Movies III\\" episode. It was also used in a second version of the remake of the original 1974 Meow Mix commercial in 2002, which lacks the lyrics. A United Kingdom-specific version entitled Pop Up Video UK, aired on Channel 4, and still occasionally airs on VH1 UK and Europe. This version featured music videos by British artists such as Robbie Williams, Spice Girls, and Elvis Costello. In January 2000, the spinoff program Pop Up Quiz debuted on VH1. Utilizing the same format as Pop Up Video, the show presented trivia questions inspired by the content of each music video shown; for example, the game \\"Phil in the blank\\" was played over the video for \\"Sussudio\\" by Phil Collins. Launched at a time when the Pop Up Video brand had become a \\"veritable franchise\\", the show was called a \\"weak spin-off\\" among several \\"duds\\" launched by the network at the time. The 25th anniversary DVD release of The Rocky Horror Picture Show features a Pop Up video clip of one of the film's musical numbers, \\"Hot Patootie ‚Äì Bless My Soul\\", as an extra on the second disc. MSG Network currently airs a show called TXT MSG, which gives the \\"pop up\\" treatment to classic sporting events from MSG's library. This is an official Spin the Bottle production, and Low is credited as an executive producer. Controversy Artists such as Billy Joel, Jakob Dylan of The Wallflowers, and The Police, as well as others such as director Mark Pellington and Sony Music Entertainment president Tommy Mottola complained about what they perceived as harsh treatment on the show and the videos in which they were featured were pulled. The show's creators called these the \\"Pops They Stopped.\\" Pellington was involved as the director of Jon Bon Jovi's \\"Midnight in Chelsea\\", while Mottola was referenced in the treatment of Mariah Carey's \\"Honey\\". The artists in question were still featured on later episodes, such as The Wallflowers with \\"Heroes\\" (Episode 108) and \\"6th Avenue Heartache\\" (Episode 135), and The Police with \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" (Episode 122) and \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\\" (Episode 138). In contrast, some artists, including Joan Osborne and Paula Abdul, made appearances on the show to provide further information on their popped videos. Reception and commentary Pop Up Video is most frequently compared to the contemporaneous television programs Beavis and Butt-head and Mystery Science Theater 3000, which were known for their on-screen commentary ridiculing, respectively, music videos and films. As these shows were described as \\"TV- for-people-who-are-sick-of-TV\\", Pop Up Video has been called \\"a show for people who hate videos\\". Reboot VH1 ordered 60 new half-hour episodes of Pop Up Video that started airing on October 3, 2011. In addition to the traditional music video format, five of the most popular episodes from season one of Jersey Shore were given the pop-up treatment in spring of 2012. A second season aired starting on August 6, 2012. The series was not renewed for a third season. Derivatives and parodies Early on, the show's popularity led to several copycats, most notably on an episode of the ABC television series Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (September 19, 1997) and a series of Bell Atlantic commercials. Spin The Bottle, the creators of Pop Up Video, publicly derided these Pop Up imitators on its website. Some series, such as NewsRadio, Family Guy, The Drew Carey Show, Bill Nye the Science Guy, High School Musical (and its sequels), Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Cake Boss and Kate Plus 8 also featured special or repeat episodes that employed pop-up facts. The History channel's series Pawn Stars and its spinoff, Cajun Pawn Stars, also employ the use of pop-up style notes when explaining the item being sold or pawned. At the height of the show's popularity, MAD Magazine ran a series of Pop-Off Video takeoffs which mocked the artists, their fashions, their songs, and their music videos. The North American anime distributor A.D. Vision (ADV Films) incorporated a feature on some of its DVD releases called \\"AD Vid- Notes,\\" which provided trivia and cultural notes in pop-up bubbles when the feature was turned on. ADV-released shows incorporating the feature included Excel Saga and Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi. A similar show is aired on the Argentine TV channel I.Sat. It is called Video Man√≠ (peanut video), because the pop-ups are a 3-D rotating peanut. It features a series of true/false questions on things regarding the theme of the video, and after a few seconds it shows \\"true\\" or \\"false\\". As I.Sat is a movie channel, the videos are used as fill between movies. Disney Channel occasionally uses Pop- Up styled videos during special airings of DCOMs, such as High School Musical 2 and Jump In!. These are referred to as the \\"What's What Edition\\". During the ending of the movie Music and Lyrics, the conclusion of the film is revealed through a Pop-Up Video of \\"Pop! Goes My Heart\\". In 2001, Nick at Nite created Pop-Up Brady, which took select episodes of The Brady Bunch and added pop-up trivia notes collected by Woody Thompson from interviews with cast members. The NickMom series What Was Carol Brady Thinking? featured a Pop-Up Video- style format to show satirical thoughts of how Carol Brady regarded scenes during episodes of The Brady Bunch; this was a non-Spin the Bottle production and had no involvement from anyone with the Brady Bunch series, including Florence Henderson. In 2010, NickToons released a Pop-Up Video style format for all 61 episodes of Avatar: The Last Airbender entitled \\"Avatar Extras\\". In 2014, HGTV released House Hunters Pop'd featuring families looking to purchase a home while trivia questions and facts pop up on the screen.

Construction and commissioning The contract to build Sturgeon was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 30 November 1961 and her keel was laid down there on 10 August 1963. She was launched on 26 February 1966, sponsored by Louella Carver, the wife of United States Senator Everett Dirksen (1896‚Äì1969) of Illinois, and commissioned on 3 March 1967, with Commander Curtis B. Shellman, Jr., in command. Image:USS_Sturgeon_Mrs_Everett_Dirkson.jpg Image:USS Sturgeon (SSN-637) Launch.jpg Image:USS_Sturgeon_(SSN-637)_Launch2.jpg Service history =1968‚Äì1970= Sturgeon spent a month conducting refresher training and then began her shakedown cruise on 3 April 1967 down the United States East Coast and to Puerto Rico. She returned to Groton for repairs, alterations, maintenance, and training until 18 September 1967, when she departed on extended operations. She returned to port on 2 October 1967 and was transferred to Submarine Development Group 2. On 22 January 1968, she began a five-week antisubmarine warfare exercise to evaluate the relative effectiveness of Sturgeon-class and Permit class attack submarines. Sturgeon began a three-month post-shakedown period of alterations and repairs on 3 March 1968. When the shipyard work was completed in June 1968, she participated in the search for the missing attack submarine in the vicinity of the Azores. She spent July and August 1968 preparing for overseas deployment, then was deployed from September to early November 1968. She participated in tests and evaluation of a new sonar detection device from December 1968 to February 1969. She visited the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in March 1969 and then held an intensive training period for her crew before deploying from May to July 1969. In April 1969, she was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for outstanding service during a period in 1968. Sturgeon participated in fleet submarine exercises in August and September 1969 and in a project for the Chief of Naval Operations from 29 September to 31 October 1969. She was awarded a second Meritorious Unit Commendation, in December 1969, for her service during a period earlier in 1969. After training and preparation for another period at sea, she deployed from 29 January to 8 April 1970. In May and June 1970, she aided in evaluating aircraft antisubmarine warfare tactics and equipment. She spent the period from 1 July to 26 July 1970 in a submarine exercise, and from 15 August to 1 September 1970 in sound trials. On 5 October 1970 she began an overhaul at Groton which lasted until 5 October 1971. While in the shipyard in December 1970, Sturgeon was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service during a period earlier that year. =1971‚Äì1994= When Sturgeon completed her overhaul in October 1971, she was transferred to Submarine Squadron 10 based at New London, Connecticut. She held refresher training and completed a shakedown cruise from 6 October to 15 December 1971. The period from 16 December 1971 through 16 January 1972 was a leave and upkeep period. She then participated in two antisubmarine warfare exercises before returning to Groton for repairs and alterations from 6 March to 27 May 1972. She conducted sea trials until 15 July 1972, at which time she began a test on sonar systems which lasted until mid-December 1972. Sturgeon spent the period from 1 January to 2 April 1973 conducting local operations in the Narragansett Bay area. On 3 April 1973, she departed for the Fleet Weapons Range in the Caribbean. On 21 May 1973, she ran aground near St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands while making some 10 knots (18.5 kilometers per hour). She sustained damage to her bow and was forced to return to Groton on 4 June 1973 to repair the damage. Sturgeon returned to sea for local operations from 17 July to 1 October 1973, when she entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, to effect bow repairs. She remained in the shipyard until 22 April 1974. After sea trials, she returned to her home port, New London, for a ten- day upkeep period. She operated from New London until 13 August 1974 when she departed for Norfolk, Virginia, to join other fleet units participating in Atlantic Readiness Exercise 1-75. She then returned to New London to hold local training exercises in preparation for an overseas movement. Sturgeon stood out to sea on 29 November 1974, en route to the Mediterranean and a scheduled six-month deployment there with the United States Sixth Fleet. She arrived in the Mediterranean on 9 December 1974. Sturgeon performed ICEX '89 in the late winter and early spring of 1989, surfacing through the ice in the Arctic Circle.http://www.history.navy.mil/museums/keyport/pdfs/sturgeonsail.pdf Sturgeon was undergoing a refit in Charleston Naval Shipyard when Hurricane Hugo struck Charleston, SC on September 21, 1989, and was therefore unable to leave the port during the storm.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/ssn-637.htm Decommissioning and disposal Sturgeon was decommissioned on 1 August 1994 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 11 December 1995. Commemoration On 15 September 1995 at the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, Washington, a ceremony commemorated the transfer of Sturgeons sail from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The sail is now located in the museums parking lot. The control center is now on display at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut.

A History of the Frankfurt Book Fair Dundurn Press Ltd., 2007 Many of his books deal with war and showed the German human side of things as experienced by their soldiers and families at home, for instance Das geschenkte Gesicht (The bestowed face) which deals with a German soldier's recovery after his sledge ran over an anti-personnel mine and destroyed his face, and how this affected his relationship with his wife at home. It places no judgment on the German position in the war and simply deals with human beings in often desperate situations, doing what they were forced to do under German military law. Der Arzt von Stalingrad (The Doctor of Stalingrad) made him famous and was adapted as a movie in 1958. Some 83 million copies sold of his 155 novels made him the most popular German novelist of the postwar era and many of his novels were translated and sold through book clubs. He is buried in Cologne. Life and work in the Nazi era At the age of 16, G√ºnther wrote feature articles for Cologne newspapers. In 1938 he published what he considered his ‚Äúfirst usable poem.‚ÄùOtto Koehler: Gestapomann Konsalik. In: Die Zeit, issue 32/1996, 2 August 1996. On August 31, 1939, he completed the heroic tragedy Der Geuse (‚ÄúThe Beggar‚Äù) as a senior secondary student. He then joined the Hitler Youth, Area 11, Middle Rhine Valley. In December 1939 he started working for the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police.Matthias Harder: Erfahrung Krieg: Zur Darstellung des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den Romanen von Heinz G. Konsalik (‚ÄúWar experience: Depicting the Second World War in the novels of Heinz G. Konsalik‚Äù. K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, S. 41. His next drama, which he completed in March 1940, was called Gutenberg. In the same year G√ºnther sought membership in the Nazi writer's union, the Reich Chamber of Writers (Reichsschrifttumskammer) but was initially rejected due to the limited scope of his literary work. Later, however, having met the requirements, he received the chamber membership required for regular publication of literary works. After graduating from the Humboldt-Gymnasium in Cologne, which required membership in the Nazi party and the teaching of its discredited but then pervasive racial theories, he studied medicine and later switched to theatre studies, literary history and German literature. During World War II he became a war correspondent in France and later came to the Eastern Front as a soldier, where he suffered a serious arm wound at Smolensk in the Soviet Union.Gunar Ortlepp: Urwaldg√∂ttin darf nicht weinen (‚ÄúA jungle goddess mustn't cry‚Äù) in Der Spiegel, 1976:50, pp. 219-221, 6 December 1976. He was later to describe his wartime experiences in Russia as a ‚Äúmonstrous school.‚ÄùDie Ein-Mann-Traumfabrik ‚Äì Portr√§t des Bestseller-Autors Heinz G.

Barghash ruled Zanzibar from 7 October 1870 to 26 March 1888. Reign Barghash is credited with building much of the infrastructure of Stone Town, including piped water, public baths, a police force, roads, parks, hospitals and large administrative buildings such as the (Bait el-Ajaib) House of Wonders. He was perhaps the last Sultan to maintain a measure of true independence from European control. He did consult with European \\"advisors\\" who had immense influence, but he was still the central figure they wrestled to control. He crossed wits with diplomats from Britain, America, Germany, France and Portugal and was often able to play one country off. It was his son, Khaled, who while vying for the succession, was the loser in the Shortest War. In 1859 a dispute broke out between the brothers Sayyid Majid, the first Sultan of Zanzibar, and Barghash. Their sister Sayyida Salme (later Emily Ruete) acted (at the age of fifteen) as secretary of Barghash's party. However, with the help of an English gunboat the insurrection of Barghash was soon brought to an end, and Barghash was sent into exile in Bombay for two years. After the death of Majid, Barghash became Sultan. Women at the Court of the Sultan of Zanzibar, 1880s According to Ruete, Barghash did not release Khalifah before one of their sisters prepared to set out for a pilgrimage for Mecca, and \\"he did not want to bring down upon himself a curse pronounced in the Holy City of the Prophet. But his sister did not pardon him before he had set free the innocent Chal√Æfe.\\" Barghash is credited with building much of the infrastructure of Stone Town, including roads, parks, hospitals, piped water, and public baths, including the Hamamni Persian Baths. Sayyid Barghash had a treaty with the British to help stop the slave trade in Zanzibar,Stanley, H.M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, but he was not always scrupulous in his commitment. In the late-1860s, he was suspected of taking money from the slave traders to allow them to continue the practice, and he maintained this double deal for some years; HMS Daphne liberated 2000 slaves in the Indian Ocean over many years, mainly near Zanzibar. In June 1873 John Kirk was acting British Consul and received simultaneous and contradictory instructions from London, one to issue an ultimatum to the Sultan under threat of blockade that the slave trade must be unequivocally stopped and the slave market closed, and the other not to actually enforce a blockade which might be taken as an act of war pushing Zanzibar towards French protection. Kirk only showed the first instruction to Barghash, who capitulated within two weeks signing a further treaty with Britain prohibiting slave trade in his kingdom, and immediately closing the great slave market.Christopher Lloyd, The Navy and the Slave Trade: The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century, 1968, pp 264-268 Towards the end of his reign Barghash had to witness the disintegration of his inherited empire. In 1884 the German adventurer Carl Peters made African chiefs on the Tanganyika mainland sign documents which declared their areas to be under German \\"protection\\". In February 1885 these acquisitions were ratified by the German Government through an imperial letter of protection. Few weeks later in April 1885, the German Dehnhardt brothers concluded a contract with the Sultan of Witu (former ruler of Pate) on the Kenya Coast near Lamu which was also put under official German protection. Bargash tried to send troops against the Witu ruler who in his view anyhow was supposed to be his subject when the appearance of a German fleet forced him to accept the German intrusion. The British-German agreement of 29 October 1886 acknowledged the Sultan's rule over a 10-mile-strip along the coast from Portuguese Mozambique up to the Tana River and some towns on the Somali coast. This agreement, however, was only short-lived as it cut the German areas of influence off the sea. Bargash did not live to see the 1888 agreement come into force which signed off the coastal strip of later Tanganyika to the Germans resulting in the uprising of the Sultans' subjects against the Germans and its subsequent repression.

He ruled Zanzibar from 26 March 1888 to 13 February 1890 and was succeeded by his brother, Ali bin Said. Life In 1870 his elder brother and predecessor Barghash bin Said had him imprisoned for the (alleged) entanglement in a coup attempt. According to their sister Emily Ruete, Barghash did not release Khalifah before one of their sisters prepared to set out for a pilgrimage for Mecca, and \\"he did not want to bring down upon himself a curse pronounced in the Holy City of the Prophet.

According to Ruete, Barghash continued to spy on Khalifah and his friends. She notes one instance where Barghash apparently willfully ruined a wealthy chief and friend of Khalifah, so that Khalifah would be deprived of support from rich chiefs. He became Sultan upon the sudden death of his brother during the protracted negotiations with the German East Africa Company. Unlike his brother, he gave in to lease the Tanganyika coast of mainland East Africa to the Germans, which immediately led to the Abushiri Revolt.

She has served as Senate leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) since 2013, and is currently Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. She was a cabinet minister in the Rudd and Gillard Governments from 2007 to 2013. Born in Malaysia to an Australian mother and Malaysian father, Wong was educated at Scotch College in Adelaide, and then attended the University of Adelaide, graduating with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. Prior to entering Federal parliament, Wong worked as a lawyer and political advisor. Wong has been described by her biographer as, \\"principled, intellectual, private, restrained and sane.\\" In 2008, she became the first Asian-born member of an Australian cabinet. She was also the first female openly-LGBTI Australian federal parliamentarian and federal government cabinet minister, supporting legalised same-sex marriage in Australia despite having previously opposed it.  Early life  Wong was born in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, to Jane (n√©e Chapman), an Australian, and Francis Wong, a Malaysian of Chinese origin. Her father was an architect. After her parents separated, she moved to Adelaide, South Australia, at the age of eight with her mother and younger brother. =Education and student politics= After starting at Coromandel Valley Primary School, Wong gained a scholarship to Scotch College, Adelaide where she studied chemistry, physics and mathematics, and was accepted into the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery at the University of Adelaide. After spending a year on exchange in Brazil, Wong found she had an aversion to blood. She then studied and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence and a Bachelor of Laws with Honours at the University of Adelaide, and completed a Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice at the University of South Australia. While at university, she became involved with the leadership of the Adelaide University Labor Club in 1988, and has been a delegate to the South Australian Labor Party State Convention every year since 1989, (with the exception of 1995). She also worked part-time for the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), and won a position on the National Executive of the National Union of Students. A number of her contemporaries at university went on to become Australian politicians. Former senator for South Australia, Natasha Stott Despoja, was a contemporary, along with former Premier of South Australia Jay Weatherill (with whom she had a relationship) and Mark Butler, Labor MP for Port Adelaide.  Professional career Wong graduated from the University of South Australia in 1992, and continued her association with the CFMEU as an industrial officer. She was admitted to the South Australian Bar in 1993. During 1995 and 1996, Wong acted as an advisor to the CFMEU and to the newly elected New South Wales state government, specialising in the area of forest policy in the middle of the fierce 1990s environmental battles over logging in NSW. On returning to Adelaide, Wong began practising law, working as a solicitor at the firm Duncan and Hannon (1996‚Äì1999). From 1999 to 2002, she worked as a legal officer with the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union. During this time she also won a position on the ALP's state executive. During her legal career (1996‚Äì2002), Wong appeared as counsel in 11 reported decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, 15 reported decisions of the South Australian Industrial Relations Court, 8 reported decisions of the South Australian Industrial Relations Commission, 3 reported decisions of the South Australian Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal and 10 reported decisions of the South Australian Workers Compensation Tribunal.Figures from AustLII, accessed at http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi- bin/sinosrch.cgi?query=%22P%20Wong%22;results=50;submit=Search;mask_world=;mask_path=;callback=on;method=auto;meta=%2Fau;view=database- natural;offset=0. Parliamentary service = Entering Parliament = Wong ran for pre-selection for the Senate in 2001, and was selected for the top position on the Labor Party's South Australian ticket. She was elected at the 2001 election, her term commencing on 1 July 2002. Wong is a member of EMILY's List Australia, the support network for Labor women, and sat on a number of Senate committees, primarily those related to economics. Wong in 2007 = Shadow ministry = In June 2005, Wong was appointed Shadow Minister for Employment and Workforce Participation, and Shadow Minister for Corporate Governance and Responsibility. Following the reshuffle in December 2006, she became responsible for the portfolios of Public Administration and Accountability, Corporate Governance and Responsibility, and Workforce Participation. =Government and first ministry= 326x326px In December 2007, in the wake of the Labor Party victory in the 2007 election, Wong was appointed to the Cabinet of Australia in the First Rudd Government as the Minister for Climate Change and Water and later, for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water in early 2010. She later remarked that her own father was most proud, not so much at her become the first Asian-born person to serve in an Australian Cabinet, but because she was subsequently given \\"a fleeting mention\\" in a book by Lee Kuan Yew. She accompanied then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to Bali for the international climate change talks. Wong led final negotiations as Chair of the United Nations Working Group in the closing days of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2007, shortly after her appointment as minister. She was said to be one of the \\"Rudd gang of four\\", who made \\"the key decisions.\\" = Minister for Finance and Government Leader = Shortly after the commencement of the Gillard Government in June 2010, Julia Gillard promoted Wong to succeed Lindsay Tanner as Minister for Finance and Deregulation. At this time, Wong said she agreed with the Labor Party policy on marriage because there was a, \\"cultural, religious and historical view of marriage being between a man and a woman\\". Penny Wong stands by Kevin Rudd at a press conference at Balmain Town Hall in July 2013. In February 2013, Wong was elected as the ALP's deputy Senate leader following the resignation of Chris Evans, thus becoming Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate.Ministerial Representation & Senate Office Holders in the Senate 43rd Parliament ‚Ä¢ 25 March 2013 ‚Ä¢ The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia , accessed 8 September 2013 Wong retained the position of Minister for Finance after Kevin Rudd's successful leadership spill in June 2013. At this point she became Leader of the Government in the Senate, holding these roles until Labor's defeat at the 2013 federal election. Strikingly, \\"she emerges well from the memoirs of both Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, despite the poison between the two.\\" In June 2013, following Stephen Conroy's resignation and the beginning of the Second Rudd Government she became the first woman to be elected as ALP Senate leader, and the first woman to serve as Leader of the Government in the Senate.Senator The Hon Penny Wong , directory.gov.au, accessed 8 September 2013 =Opposition Leader in Senate and Foreign Affairs= Following Labor's defeat at the 2013 Australian federal election, Wong was elected Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She was also appointed Labor's foreign affairs spokesperson. In this role, she helped negotiate Australia's interests in the Trans-Pacific Partnership which was ratified in late 2018. When a journalist noted that this was unexpected, given she is a member of her party's Labor Left faction, she replied, \\"I know, it's odd isn't it.\\" In March 2019, Wong was named the 2018 McKinnon Political Leader of the Year. Following the 2019 Labor leadership contest, Wong retained her positions as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new cabinet of Anthony Albanese. At this point she was named part of Albanese's four-person ALP leadership team, along with Richard Marles and Kristina Keneally. In this role, Wong has delivered \\"forthright\\" views on Australia‚ÄìUnited States relations. While she believed the election of Donald Trump meant there should be a \\"global rethink\\" on working with the US, she maintains a very high view of the alliance, which has been a feature of Australian Labor Party thinking since it began under wartime leader, John Curtin, saying, \\"I think America has been the key guarantor in an international system which has enabled more peace and prosperity than probably any period in the world‚Äôs history.‚Äù Similarly, she strongly believes in both Australian and US engagement with South East Asia through ASEAN. During a speech to the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in January 2018, Wong said: \\"it is in the interests of all South East Asian nations that the US remains strategically engaged with the region.\\" She sets both the US alliance, and the need for engagement with Asia in historical terms: > The calamity that was WW2 in the Pacific provided the setting for one of the > most interesting, stable and enduring alliances of the 20th century ‚Äì the > ANZUS alliance between the US, Australia and New Zealand. While it was > forged in war, it has matured in peace. What began as a response to a threat > to the security of both the US and Australia has evolved into a relationship > built around shared strategic objectives underpinned by shared fundamental > values. Our alliance with the US has stood strong for 70 years. But of > course our history, our friendship and our co-operation is even greater. The > 100 years of mateship we honour this year is a celebration of shared values > as much as of military co-operation. At times, Wong and her party have been accused of being \\"soft\\" in its response to the \\"bullying\\" behaviour of communist China. However, Wong has been firm that Australians, and Australian political leaders, need to speak freely about Australian values and where they differ from those of our neighbours: \\"We're a democracy so freedom of speech, open dialogue and the exchange of ideas is part of who we are and I would hope that all countries would expect that when dealing with Australia.\\" As leader in foreign affairs, she has come under pressure from ALP elders, such as Paul Keating and Gareth Evans, for Australia to \\"cut the tag\\" with the United States. However, Wong has remained resolved that the alliance would remain, \\"deep, long-standing and institutional.\\"  Personal life  Wong is a practising Christian, attending Pilgrim Uniting Church in Adelaide. She has said that, \\"I don't ever remember having the sense that I denied the existence of God.\\" She has talked about the value of faith and prayer in her life, which comes from Christian members of her family, though many parts of her wider family in Sabah are Buddhist. She held Malaysian citizenship until 2001. Wong is a lesbian and came out publicly a month after she assumed her Senate seat in 2002. In 2010, Wong was selected by readers of Samesame website as one of the 25 most influential lesbian Australians. Wong's domestic partner, Sophie Allouache, is a public servant and former University of Adelaide Students' Association president. In December 2011, Allouache gave birth to their first child, after announcing the IVF- assisted pregnancy using donor sperm in August 2011. Allouache gave birth to their second daughter in 2015, at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital. While at university, Wong dated Jay Weatherill, who later became Premier of South Australia. In 2002, Wong's brother Toby took his own life ten days after her election to the Senate.

People throughout history have shaved all or part of their heads for diverse reasons including practicality, convenience, fashion, style, religion, aesthetics, culture, and punishment. Early history The earliest historical records describing head shaving are from ancient Mediterranean cultures such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The Egyptian priest class ritualistically removed all hair from head to toe by plucking it. Contexts =Military= Barber at the souk (1897) by Enrique Simonet The practice of shaving heads has been used in the military. Although sometimes explained as being for hygiene reasons, the image of strict and disciplined conformity is also accepted as a factor. Upon the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II, many soldiers chose to have their heads completely shaved to deny the defending Nazis something to grab onto if they found themselves in hand-to-hand combat. For the new recruit, it can be a rite of passage, and variations become a badge of honor. The militaries of the United States, Russia, and several other countries welcome their recruits by giving them haircuts using hair clippers with no guard attached. As of 2011, a shaved head continued to be the standard haircut in the Air Force, Marine Corps, Army, and Coast Guard of the U.S. during basic training; upon graduation, grooming restrictions are relaxed in accordance with each service's regulations. There have been traditions spawned from this, such as shaving one's head when a service member enters the Mediterranean Sea by ship for the first time (known as \\"Med Head\\").. In Greece, this practice was abolished on 25 June 1982, when the military started allowing recruits to have up to 4 cm of hair. Before then, the regulation haircut in the Greek Army for recruits was en hro (an archaic phrase for \\"shaved to the bone\\"). =Prison and punishment= French women accused of collaborating with the Nazis being paraded through the streets barefoot, shaved, and with swastikas burned into their faces in 1944 Prisoners commonly have their heads shaven to prevent the spread of lice, but it may also be used as a demeaning measure. Having the head shaved can be a punishment prescribed in law.\\"Article 87 ... shall be sentenced to flogging, having his head shaven, and one year of exile ...\\", The Islamic Penal Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran The Nazis punished people accused of racial mixing by parading them through the streets with shaved heads and placards around their necks detailing their crime. During and after World War II, thousands of French women had their heads shaved in front of cheering crowds as punishment for either collaborating with the Nazis or having sexual relationships with Nazi soldiers during the war.\\"Shaved Heads and Marked Bodies: Representations From Cultures of Trauma\\" Kristine Stiles, Duke University (1993) Duke.edu\\"Shorn Women: Gender and Punishment in Liberation France\\", Some Finnish women also had their heads shaved for allegedly having relationships with Soviet POWs during the war.\\"Ryss√§n heilat ja pikku-Iivanat\\" =Religious= A Buddhist monk shaving the head of a devotee to prepare him for priesthood Many Buddhists and Vaisnavas, especially Hare Krishnas, shave their heads. Some Hindu and most Buddhist monks and nuns shave their heads upon entering their order, and Buddhist monks and nuns in Korea have their heads shaved every 15 days.Geraldine A. Larkin, First You Shave Your Head, Celestial Arts (2001), Muslim men have the choice of shaving their head after performing the Umrah and Hajj, following the tradition of committing to Allah, but are not required to keep it permanently shaved. Hasidic Jewish men will occasionally shave all of their head except for the sides to emphasize their payot (sidelocks). In certain Hasidic sects, most famously Satmar, married women shave their head every month before immersion in the mikveh (ritual bath). =Class= Throughout much of the 20th century in many Western countries, head shaving was considered somewhat unusual or lower-class. Head shaving was often associated with manual workers such as sailors, dockers, and soldiers, as well as with prisoners and hospital patients. In contrast, ancient Mayan nobles shaved their heads. =Sport= Mo Farah with a shaved head Randy Orton with a shaved head by choice Competitive swimmers will often shave their body from head to toe to reduce drag while swimming. The same may also be true for sprinters, joggers, and other runners. =Baldness= People suffering from hair loss may shave their heads in order to look more presentable, be more convenient, or adhere to a certain style or fashion movement. Those with alopecia areata or pattern baldness often choose to shave, which has rapidly become a more common choice since the 1990s. It has also become more common for bald men to accessorize with small hoop or stud earrings, a look famously adopted by figures such as basketball player Michael Jordan and professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin upon shaving their heads in the 1990s.

Examples include those played by Yul Brynner, Vin Diesel, Telly Savalas (Kojak), Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu), and Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley), as well as characters such as Walter White, Mr. Clean, Kratos, Agent 47, and Saitama. Baldness is sometimes an important part of these characters' biographies; for example, Saitama lost all of his hair in exchange for receiving his superpowers. Shaved heads are also often associated with villains in fiction, such as Lex Luthor, Colonel Kurtz, and Ernst Stavro Blofeld. A notable exception is Daddy Warbucks. A goatee, usually of the Van Dyke variety, is often worn to complement the look or add sophistication; this look was widely popularized in the mid-to-late 1990s by professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin. For the majority of the crime drama series Breaking Bad, often regarded as one of the greatest TV series of all time,Sources that refer to Breaking Bad being praised as one of the greatest television shows of all time include:    * the aforementioned Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) wore a Van Dyke with a shaved head, contributing to the character's iconic status. In futuristic settings, shaved heads are often associated with bland uniformity, especially in sterile settings such as V for Vendetta and THX 1138. In the 1927 sci-fi film Metropolis, hundreds of extras had their heads shaved to represent the oppressed masses of a future dystopia. It is less common for female characters to have shaved heads, though some actresses have shaved their headsMatt Bagwell, A Bald Move ... From Britney Spears To Karen Gillan: 20 Female Celebs Who Have Shaved Off Their Hair, The Huffington Post, 22 July 2013 or used bald capsFor example, Christine Taylor in a Friends episode, according to The New York Times article on her for roles. =Skinhead and other subcultures= In the 1960s, some British working-class youths developed the skinhead subculture, whose members were distinguished by short cropped hair (although they did not shave their heads down to the scalp at the time). This look was partly influenced by the Jamaican rude boy style. It was not until the skinhead revival in the late 1970s‚Äîwith the appearance of punk-influenced Oi! skinheads‚Äîthat many skinheads started shaving their hair right down to the scalp. Head shaving has also appeared in other youth-oriented subcultures such as the hardcore, black metal, metalcore, nu metal, hip hop, techno, and neo- nazi scenes. =Sexuality and gender= A sexual fetish involving head shaving is called trichophilia. While a shaved head on a man is often seen as a sign of authority and virility, a shaved head on a woman typically connotes androgyny, especially when combined with traditionally feminine signifiers. It may, but does not always, express membership in the LGBT community; gay men sometimes incorporate a shaven head into their overall look, particularly amongst the bear subculture. Those with the stereotypical \\"Castro clone\\" look commonly shave their heads in order to project a homoerotic, ultra-masculine image. Drag queens have sometimes adopted shaved heads to express a genderqueer image. In the BDSM community, shaving a submissive or slave's head is often used to demonstrate powerlessness or submission to the will of a dominant. =Fundraising and support= Cancer Women shaving their heads at the 46 Mommas event, a cancer-related fundraising and awareness program Baldness is a well-known side effect of the chemotherapy often used to treat cancer, and some people shave their heads before undergoing such treatment; some people chose to shave their heads in solidarity with cancer sufferers, particularly as part of a fundraising effort. Covhead-19 Challenge During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries imposed strict lockdown procedures and actively encouraged members of the public to self- isolate. Many people, particularly men, initially began to shave their heads as a way of fighting boredom during lockdown and because they were unable to have their hair cut due to all barber shops being closed.\\"Why are so many people shaving their heads?\\" In the UK, a fundraising effort began to support the NHS, which suffered from the enormous pressure of the pandemic. The effort was started on Just Giving with a goal of ¬£100,000; dubbed the \\"Covhead-19 Challenge\\", it encouraged people to shave their heads whilst also donating money to the NHS. Various celebrities have also taken part.

It is sometimes intended as a pejorative, bearing the implication that the scarce medical research resources allocated to develop such drugs were spent frivolously when they could have been better spent researching cures for more serious medical conditions. Proponents, however, point out that improving the patient's subjective quality of life has always been a primary concern of medicine, and argue that these drugs are doing just that. It finds broad use in both media and scholarly journals. Concept and impact on society There is direct impact of lifestyle drugs on society, particularly in the developing world. Implications associated with labeling of indications and products sales of these lifestyle drugs may be varied. Drugs can, over time, switch from 'lifestyle' to 'mainstream' use. Bioethics and medical policy debate Though no precise widely accepted definition or criteria are associated with the term, there is much debate within the fields of pharmacology and bioethics around the propriety of developing such drugs, particularly after the commercial debut of Viagra. The German government's health insurance scheme has denied insurance coverage for some Lifestyle-Medikament (\\"lifestyle drugs\\") which they deem spurious.Sanofi drops after FDA staff comments on Acomplia Critics of pharmaceutical firms claim that pharmaceutical firms actively medicalize; that is, they invent novel disorders and diseases which were not recognized as such before their \\"cures\\" could be profitably marketed, in effect pathologizing what were widely regarded as normal conditions of human existence. The consequences are said to include generally greater worries about health, misallocation of limited medical research resources to comparatively minor conditions while many serious diseases remain uncured, and needless health care expenditure. This medicalization of some element of human condition has significance, in principle, as a matter for political discourse or dialogue in civil society concerning values or morals. Social critics also question the propriety of devoting huge research budgets towards creating these drugs when far more dangerous diseases like cancer and AIDS remain uncured. It is sometimes claimed that lifestyle drugs amount to little more than medically sanctioned recreational drug use.

This is particularly useful for understanding and mapping trends, influences, effects, and affects within cultures. There are four themes to sociological cultural analysis: 1\\\\. Adaptation and Change This refers to how well a certain culture adapts to its surroundings by being used and developed. Some examples of this are foods, tools, home, surroundings, art, etc. that show how the given culture adapted. Also, this aspect aims to show how the given culture makes the environment more accommodating. 2\\\\. How culture is used to survive How the given culture helps its members survive the environment. 3\\\\. Holism, Specificity The ability to put the observations into a single collection, and presenting it in a coherent manner. 4\\\\. Expressions This focuses on studying the expressions and performance of everyday culture. Cultural Analysis in the Humanities This developed at the intersection of cultural studies, comparative literature, art history, fine art, philosophy, literary theory, theology, anthropology. It developed an interdisciplinary approach to the study of texts, images, films, and all related cultural practices. It offers an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of cultural representations and practices. Cultural Analysis is also a method for rethinking our relation to history because it makes visible the position of researcher, writer or student. The social and cultural present from which we look at past cultural practices‚Äîhistory‚Äî shapes the interpretations that are made of the past, while cultural analysis also reveals how the past shapes the present through the role of cultural memory for instance. Cultural analysis understands culture, therefore, as a constantly changing set of practices that are in dialogue with the past as it has been registered through texts, images, buildings, documents, stories, myths. In addition to having a relation to disciplines also interested in cultures as what people do and say, believe and think, such as ethnography and anthropology, cultural analysis as a practice in the humanities considers the texts and images, the codes and behaviours, the beliefs and imaginings that you might study in literature, philosophy, art history. But cultural analysis does not confine the meanings to the disciplinary methods. It allows and requires dialogue across many ways of understanding what people have done and what people are doing through acts, discourses, practices, statements. Cultural analysis crosses the boundaries between disciplines but also between formal and informal cultural activities. The major purpose of cultural analysis is to develop analytical tools for reading and understanding a wide range of cultural practices and forms, past and present.

They occur in virtually any freshwater habitat around the world, but a few species live among leaf litter. The adults of most are between long, though much variation is seen between species. The European Dytiscus latissimus and Brazilian Megadytes ducalis are the largest, reaching up to and respectively. In contrast, the smallest is likely the Australian Limbodessus atypicali of subterranean waters, which only is about long. Most are dark brown, blackish, or dark olive in color with golden highlights in some subfamilies. The larvae are commonly known as water tigers due to their voracious appetite. They have short, but sharp mandibles and immediately upon biting, they deliver digestive enzymes into prey to suck their liquefied remains. The family includes more than 4,000 described species in numerous genera.  Habitat  Diving beetles are the most diverse beetles in the aquatic environment and can be found in almost every kind of freshwater habitat, from small rock pools to big lakes. Some dytiscid species are also found in brackish water. Diving beetles live in water bodies in various landscapes, including agricultural and urban landscapes. Some species, such as Agabus uliginosus and Acilius canaliculatus, are found to be relatively tolerant to recent urbanization.  Larvae and development  alt= When still in larval form, the beetles vary in size from about 1 to 5 cm (0.5 to 2.0 in). The larval bodies are shaped like crescents, with the tail long and covered with thin hairs. Six legs protrude from along the thorax, which also sports the same thin hairs. The head is flat and square, with a pair of long, large pincers. When hunting, they cling to grasses or pieces of wood along the bottom, and hold perfectly still until prey passes by, then they lunge, trapping their prey between their front legs and biting down with their pincers. The larvae are also known to partially consume prey and discard the carcass if another potential prey swims nearby. Their usual prey includes tadpoles and glassworms, among other smaller water- dwelling creatures. As the larvae mature, they crawl from the water on the sturdy legs, and bury themselves in the mud for pupation. After about a week, or longer in some species, they emerge from the mud as adults. Adult diving beetles have been found to oviposit their eggs within frog spawn in highly ephemeral habitats, with their eggs hatching within 24 hours after the frogs and the larvae voraciously predating on the recently hatched tadpoles. Edibility Adult Dytiscidae, particular of the genus Cybister, are edible. Remnants of C. explanatus were found in prehistoric human coprolites in a Nevada cave, likely sourced from the Humboldt Sink. In Mexico, C. explanatus is eaten roasted and salted to accompany tacos. In Japan, C. japonicus has been used as food in certain regions such as Nagano prefecture. In the Guangdong Province of China, the latter species, as well as C. bengalensis, C. guerini, C. limbatus, C. sugillatus, C. tripunctatus, and probably also the well-known Great diving beetle (D. marginalis) are bred for human consumption, though as they are cumbersome to raise due to their carnivorous habit and have a fairly bland (though apparently not offensive) taste and little meat, this is decreasing. Dytiscidae are reportedly also eaten in Taiwan, Thailand, and New Guinea.De Foliart (2002), J√§ch (2003), CSIRO (2004) Dytiscidae sp. Large but slow on land, adults are also eaten with relish by many midsized birds, mammals, reptiles, and other larger predators. The larvae are usually safer, due to their camouflage and ability to escape by water jet; they can be quite hard to catch and may become apex predators in small ponds. Although not considered particularly fierce, adults have been observed working as a group and attacking much larger vertebrates such as tadpoles. Cultural significance The diving beetle plays a role in a Cherokee creation story. According to the narrative, upon finding nowhere to rest in the \\"liquid chaos\\" the beetle brought up soft mud from the bottom. This mud then spread out to form all of the land on Earth. Ethnobiology Adult Dytiscidae, as well as Gyrinidae, are collected by young girls in East Africa. It is believed that inducing the beetles to bite the nipples will stimulate breast growth. Parasites Mites of the genus Dytiscacarus were found to be are highly specialised parasites of beetles in the family Dytiscidae, undergoing their entire life cycle while inhabiting the space beneath the elytra of their hosts.Mortazavi et al.

Chechik. It stars Scott Glenn, Oliver Platt, Nick Stahl, Stephen Lang, Roger Aaron Brown, Jared Harris, with Catherine O'Hara as Calamity Jane and Patrick Swayze as Pecos Bill. The film was written by Steven L. Bloom and Robert Rodat and was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Caravan Pictures. Plot In 1905, Daniel Hackett (Nick Stahl), a young farmer from the western town of Paradise Valley, is unhappy with his life as a farmer and dreams of life in New York City. His father, Jonas (Stephen Lang), likes to tell Daniel tall tales about Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan and John Henry to which Daniel has heard many times leading him to doubt their existence. Meanwhile, Paradise Valley is being coveted by a greedy developer, J.P. Stiles (Scott Glenn). Stiles attempts to convince area farmers to sell their land to him, most notably Jonas as his farm lies in the center of where he wants to develop. However, when Jonas refuses to hand up his deed, Stiles hunts him down and shoots him, but not before Jonas hands the deed off to Daniel for safe keeping. With Jonas in critical condition and unable to farm, his land is put at risk. Upset, Daniel runs out to hide in his father's boat and falls asleep. When Daniel awakes, he discovers that the boat had come untied and drifted downstream to the deserts of Texas. After a brief encounter with some thieves, Daniel is rescued by legendary cowboy Pecos Bill (Patrick Swayze). The duo later team up with lumberjack Paul Bunyan (Oliver Platt), and strong African American ex- slave John Henry (Roger Aaron Brown). Each of these heroes hooks up with Daniel and becomes involved in an increasingly bitter and boisterous fight against Stiles, whose plans to buy up land threaten the very strength of the folk heroes and the well-being of the common people. When Stiles takes the deed, Daniel wakes up realizing it was just a dream. He ventures towards Stiles train who was about head out into the lands. Daniel confronts him, and they attempt to run him over, until John arrives and holds the train. Stiles orders his men to kill them, but Pecos arrives and shoots off their trigger fingers, and the townsfolk join in to help, while Paul, who went inside while nobody noticed, cuts down the mine poles. Daniel then finishes off the last pole killing Stiles and his men, and the crowd cheers for him. Daniel then returns to the farm and admits that the stories were true and their land is important. Paul with his blue ox Babe, and John with his mule Cold Molasses, say goodbye to Daniel and disappear afterwards. Pecos leaves his horse, Widow- Maker to Daniel and twirls his lasso at a twister for his departure.

Greenwood was born at 56, Ellor Street, his father's house and hairdresser's shop in \\"Hanky Park\\", Pendleton, Salford, Lancashire. His parents belonged to the radical working classes. His father died when he was nine years old, and his mother provided for him by working as a waitress. He left school at 13, even though the normal leaving age was 14. He was able to leave a year early after taking the Board of Education Labour Exam, which was only 'open to fatherless boys' so that they could go to work to help support their family. Quotation from Greenwood's memoir, There was a Time, 1967, p. 107. His first job was as a pawnbroker's clerk. A succession of low paid jobs followed, while he continued to educate himself in Salford Public Library. During periods of unemployment he worked for the local Labour Party and began to write short stories. Love on the Dole While unemployed, he wrote his first novel, Love on the Dole, during 1932. It was about the destructive social effects of poverty in his home town. After several rejections, it was published during 1933. It was a critical and commercial success, and a great influence on the British public's opinion of unemployment. It even prompted parliament to investigate, resulting in reforms. In 1935, Greenwood collaborated with Ronald Gow on a stage adaptation of the novel. The critic of The Times wrote: > being conceived in suffering and written in blood, it profoundly moves its > audience in January 1935... it has the supreme virtue in a piece of this > kind of saying what it has to say in plain narrative, stripped of oration. > Quoted in Chris Hopkins, Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole: Novel, Play, > Film, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 2018, p. 138 The play had successful runs in both Britain and the United States, which meant that Greenwood would not have to worry about employment again. A film adaptation was proposed in 1936, but the British Board of Film censors made strong objections to the possibility of a film about industrial unrest which might be socially divisive. Chris Hopkins,Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole: Novel, Play, Film, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 2018, p. 141 In 1940, however, when unemployment could be presented as a thing of the past, a film adaptation was permitted. The film, which toned down some of the novel's social commentary, was directed by John Baxter, and featured Deborah Kerr. It was successful with the critics and at the box office. Chris Hopkins, Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole: Novel, Play, Film, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 2018, pp. 175-178 Greenpark Productions During the Second World War, Greenwood served with the Royal Army Service Corps. Just before the war, in 1938, he had set up Greenpark Productions Ltd, a documentary film production company that made government information films for the Ministry of Information (which became the Central Office of Information from 1946). Originally based in Polperro, Cornwall, the company relocated to London in 1939. After the war it expanded into making upmarket corporate films.'Greenpark Productions', British Film Institute Amongst its roster of directors were Ken Annakin, Ralph Keene and Humphrey Swingler, brother of the poet Randall Swingler.BFI.

He abandoned his fianc√©e who sued him successfully for breach of promise. Chris Hopkins,Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole: Novel, Play, Film, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 2018, p.214-5. During 1937 he married Pearl Alice Osgood, an American actress and dancer; they divorced in 1944. Greenwood later described them as having been a pair of 'erupting volcanoes'.

He retired to Douglas, Isle of Man, in the 1950s, and died there on 13 September 1974 aged 70. Greenwood's manuscripts and letters are archived in the University of Salford's Walter Greenwood Collection.

Design and development The Mi-2 was produced exclusively in Poland, in the WSK \\"PZL-≈öwidnik\\" factory in ≈öwidnik. The first production helicopter in the Soviet Union was the Mil Mi-1, modelled along the lines of the S-51 and Bristol Sycamore and flown by Mikhail Mil's bureau in September 1948. During the 1950s it became evident, and confirmed by American and French development, that helicopters could be greatly improved with turbine engines. S. P. Isotov developed the GTD-350 engine and Mil used two of these in the far superior Mi-2. The twin shaft- turbine engines used in the Mi-2 develop 40% more power than the Mi-1's piston engines, for barely half the engine weight, with the result that the payload was more than doubled. The Mi-2 fuselage was extensively altered from its predecessor, with the engines mounted overhead. However, the external dimensions remained similar. The Mil-built prototype first flew in the Soviet Union on 22 September 1961, after the initial development the project was transferred to Poland in 1964. The first ≈öwidnik-built example flew on 4 November 1965 (making this the only Soviet-designed helicopter to be built solely outside the Soviet Union). PZL-≈öwidnik produced a total of 5,497 helicopters, about a third for military users. The factory also developed fiberglass rotor blades, and developed the wide-body Mi-2M seating 10 passengers instead of eight. Most typical role-change kits include four stretchers for air ambulance usage, or aerospraying or cropdusting applications. In Poland, several specialized military variants were also developed for support or reconnaissance roles, with 23 mm autocannon, machine guns and/or two 57 mm rocket pods, four 9K11 Malyutka anti-tank missiles or Strela-2 AA missiles. Operational history The Mi-2 was first introduced into the Soviet Air Force in 1965. The Mi-2 is used by mainly former Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries, although it was also purchased by Mexico and Myanmar armed forces. Most of the armed Mi-2 variants were used by Poland. Some were also used by the former East Germany (with machine gun and unguided rocket armament only). North Korea still maintains a large active fleet of Mi-2s.

Some sources The statement that some sources give Thompson as Lubbock's first name is made by Cutrer in the cited source. give Thompson as his first name.) Biography Lubbock was born in Charleston, South Carolina son of Henry Thomas William Lubbock and Susan Ann (nee Saltus)Six decades in Texas by Francis Richard Lubbock (1900). His brother was Governor of Texas Francis R. Lubbock. In 1835, he moved to Louisiana and worked as a cotton factor in New Orleans. When the Texas Revolution started, he marched to Nacogdoches, Texas, with Capt. William G. Cooke's company and participated in the siege of San Antonio de Bexar. Thereafter, he took employment on a steamboat on the upper Brazos River. After working for a time with Samuel May Williams and Thomas F. McKinney, Lubbock joined the Texan Santa Fe Expedition as a lieutenant of one of the military companies. His men and he were captured in New Mexico and confined in Santiago Convent, Mexico City. Lubbock escaped by jumping from the convent's balcony and made his way back to Texas. After Adri√°n Woll seized San Antonio in 1842, Lubbock was elected first lieutenant of Gardiner N. O. Smith's company, and due to Smith's illness, marched at the head of the company to Bexar to join in driving the Mexicans back across the Rio Grande. Lubbock and his men were among the Texans who followed Alexander Somervell back to Texas on December 19, 1842, after declining to join William S. Fisher on the Mier Expedition. Lubbock was a strong secessionist, characterized as a \\"very worthy and zealous\\" Knight of the Golden Circle. At the beginning of the American Civil War, he accompanied Benjamin Franklin Terry, John A. Wharton, Thomas J. Goree, and James Longstreet (who was to become the commander of I Corps of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia) from Galveston, Texas, to Richmond, Virginia. At the Confederate capital on June 22 or June 23, 1861, Terry and he, seconded by Senator Louis T. Wigfall, Thomas Neville Waul, Wharton, and Longstreet, petitioned Confederate President Jefferson Davis for \\"authority to raise a company or battalion of guerrillas.\\" \\"I must have your men,\\" Davis reportedly replied. While in Virginia, Lubbock, Terry, and some 15 other Texans organized themselves into an independent band of rangers to scout for the Confederate Army. Early in July, Lubbock and Terry, at the head of a company of Virginia cavalry, charged a Union camp, captured two of the enemy, wounded a third, and captured a horse and a Sharps rifle. Only then did they realize that they were alone and that the Virginians had not followed them in their rash attack. Lubbock was still a civilian in Virginia at the time of the battle of First Bull Run; he \\"exposed his life in bearing messages during the contest.\\" With Terry, who had also served as a volunteer aide on the battlefield, Lubbock was authorized to raise a regiment of cavalry to serve in the Confederate States Army. The two men returned to Texas and recruited the Eighth Texas Cavalry, more commonly known as \\"Terry's Texas Rangers\\". Terry served as the regimental colonel and Lubbock as lieutenant colonel. In poor health, Lubbock left the regiment at Nashville, Tennessee, and never returned to it. Personal life Lubbock was married on December 14, 1843, to Sara Anna Smith. Death and legacy Colonel Terry was killed at the Battle of Rowlett's Station (also known as the Battle of Woodsonville), in Kentucky on December 17, 1861. On January 8, 1862, Lubbock, then sick in bed in a Bowling Green hospital with typhoid fever, was promoted to colonel and advanced to command of the regiment.Allardice, Bruce S. Confederate Colonels: A Biographical Register. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2008. . p. 246. He died the next day.Allardice, 2008, p. 246 says that Lubbock died in Nashville and that three different dates are given in various sources for the date of his death in January 1862. The date given is the date on his tombstone and service record. Thomas Saltus Lubbock is buried in Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas).

On unjust enrichment as a 'unifying legal concept', see the judgment of Deane J in Pavey & Mathews v Paul (1987) 162 CLR 221. Where an individual is unjustly enriched, the law imposes an obligation upon the recipient to make restitution, subject to defences such as change of position. Liability for an unjust (or unjustified) enrichment arises irrespective of wrongdoing on the part of the recipient. The concept of unjust enrichment can be traced to Roman law and the maxim that \\"no one should be benefited at another's expense\\": nemo locupletari potest aliena iactura or nemo locupletari debet cum aliena iactura. The law of unjust enrichment is closely related to, but not co-extensive with, the law of restitution. The law of restitution is the law of gain-based recovery. It is wider than the law of unjust enrichment. Restitution for unjust enrichment is a subset of the law of restitution in the same way that compensation for breach of contract is a subset of the law relating to compensation. History = Roman law = In civilian systems of law, unjust enrichment is often referred to as unjustified enrichment. Its historical foundation of enrichment without cause can be traced back to the Corpus Iuris Civilis. While the concept of enrichment without cause was unknown in classical Roman law,Michael Stathopoulos, Axiosis Adikaiologitou Ploutismou [Claim of Unjustified Enrichment] 2 (1972). Roman legal compilers eventually enunciated the principle of unjustified enrichment based on two actions of the classical Roman period‚Äîthe condictio and the actio de in rem verso. The condictio authorized recovery by the plaintiff of a certain object or money in the hands of the defendant. The defendant was considered a borrower who was charged with returning the object or money.See MAX KASER, DAS ALTR√ñMISCHE JUS 286‚Äì88 (1949). For the actio de in rem verso, the plaintiff bore the burden of specifying the cause for his demand, namely, demanding the restitution of assets that had exited the plaintiff's patrimony and entered the defendant‚Äôs patrimony through the acts of the defendant‚Äôs servants.See Reinhard Zimmermann, The Law of Obligations: Roman Foundations of The Civilian Tradition 878‚Äì84. The coherent concept of unjustified enrichment, then appeared in the Justinian Code, based on Roman pragmatism with equitable considerations and moral principles of Greek philosophy. In the Justinian Code, condictiones were grouped into categories, such as when the plaintiff had given a thing or money: # in contemplation of a future result that did not follow; # for a reason disapproved by law or repugnant to public policy; # by mistake because payment was not actually due; or # without a good reason for the transaction. Further, the actio de in rem verso gradually expanded to cover instances in which third parties were enriched at the expense of the impoverished obligee, and unjustified enrichment was recognized as a source of obligations under the heading of ‚Äúquasi-contract.\\" = Civil law = The interpretations of Roman law principles on unjustified enrichment, by the French Jurist Jean Domat, and the German jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny, formed the respective origins of the modern French and German law on unjustified enrichment.See Christos Filios, H Aitia Stis Enochikes Symvaseis [The Causa Contrahendi] 30, 101‚Äì25 (2007) (Greece). Domat developed the French unjustified enrichment principles based on the actio de in rem verso, as well as a modified version of the Roman concept of causa (cause), which renders contracts actionable even when they are not normally recognized under Roman law. In contrast, the concept of unjustified enrichment is considerably broader and more frequently invoked in Germany and Greece to address issues of restitution as well as restoration for failed juridical acts.See 1 Max Kaser, Das R√∂mische Privatrecht ¬ß 139.3 (2d ed. 1971). Equitable tracing is a particularly well suited remedial tool. = Common law = In systems of law derived from the English common law, the historical core of the law of unjust enrichment lies in quasi-contract. These were common law (as distinct from equitable) claims giving rise to a personal liability to pay the money value of a benefit received from another. Legal scholars from Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard at the turn of the 20th century began to rationalise these disparate actions into a coherent body of law.See generally: Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History (4th edition); Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Andrew Burrows, The Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011). The principle said to underlie these actions was eventually recognized as unjust enrichment.See, e.g., Pavey & Mathews v Paul [1987] (Australia); Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale [1991] (England). Subsequent scholarship has sought to expand the explanatory power of the principle of unjust enrichment and it is now often said (albeit not without controversy)See, e.g., Bofinger v Kingsway [2009 239 CLR 269] to encompass both common law and equitable claims.See, e.g., Mitchell and Watterson, Subrogation: Law and Practice (2nd Edition). Framework Cases of unjust (or unjustified) enrichment can be examined in the following way: * Was the defendant enriched? * Was the enrichment at the expense of the claimant? * Was the enrichment unjust ? * Does the defendant have a defense? * What remedies are available to the claimant? These questions are a familiar part of the modern English law of unjust enrichment, having been popularised by the writing of Professor Peter Birks and expressly endorsed by English courts.See, e.g., Bank of Cyprus v Menelou [2015] UKSC 66 The framework provides a useful taxonomical function in Australian law,See Lampson v Fortescue Metals (No 3) [2014 WASC 162] (Edelman J). though the concept of unjust enrichment has been subject to inconsistent treatment by Australian courts, as discussed below. Stated at this level of abstraction, the framework is a useful grounding for comparative study between common law and civil law jurisdictions. =The meaning of unjust: unjust factors v absence of basis= Generally speaking, the mere receipt of a benefit from another is unobjectionable and does not attract legal consequences. The exception is where such receipt is 'unjust' or 'unjustified'. Both civilian and common law legal systems have bodies of law providing remedies to reverse such enrichment. A conceptual split, albeit one not necessarily coextensive with the common law-civilian distinction, is between systems based on an \\"unjust factor\\" approach and systems based on an \\"absence of basis\\" approach. * Common law systems such as those of England, Australia, Canada and the United States typically adopt the \\"unjust factor\\" approach. In this analysis, the claimant must point to a positive reason why the defendant's enrichment is unjust. Examples of 'unjust factors' that ground a claim for restitution include: mistakes of fact or law; total failure of consideration, duress, undue influence, and the Woolwich ground. * Civil law systems such as those of France and Germany typically adopt an \\"absence of basis\\" approach. On this analysis, the defendant is obliged to make restitution if there is no 'basis' for her receipt: for example, because the contract under which the defendant received the benefit was void ab initio. Some common law systems have showed signs of a possible shift towards this approach.See, e.g., Deutsche Morgan Grenfell v IRC [2007] 1 AC 558 In most cases, the conceptual approach does not affect the outcome of a case. For example, suppose that A makes an oral contract with B under which A will pay $100 for certain services to be provided by B. Further suppose that A pays the money but B discovers that, pursuant to legislation, contracts for such services are void unless in writing. B refuses to perform. Can A recover his payment? On both approaches, B is unjustly enriched at A's expense. On the \\"absence of basis\\" approach, B's enrichment has no legitimate explanatory basis because the contract was void. On the \\"unjust factor\\" approach, there has been a total failure of consideration; that is, A has received no part of the bargained-for counter-performance; restitution follows automatically from the fact of invalidity. =Remedies for unjust enrichment: personal and proprietary restitution= The remedy for unjust enrichment is restitution: the restoration of what was conferred to the claimant. In short, the correcting of the injustice that occurred when the claimant suffered a subtraction of wealth and the defendant received corresponding benefit.Note that it remains a controversial point, at least in English law, whether there is a distinct \\"correspondence principle\\". See generally, Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2010). Restitution can take the form of a personal or a proprietary remedy. Where a personal remedy is awarded, the defendant is ordered to pay the money value of the benefit received. This personal money award is the typical form of restitution ordered. Where a proprietary remedy is awarded, the court recognises (or declares) that the defendant has a beneficial or security interest in specific property of the defendant. Whether proprietary remedies can be awarded depends on the jurisdiction in question. * In English law, the orthodox view is that unjust enrichment generally triggers personal, rather than proprietary remedies.But see Bank of Cyprus v Menelaou [2015] UKSC 66 This is because the law of quasi-contract only generate personal money awards: either a liquidated debt (as in actions for money had and received or money paid) or a sum assessed by a civil jury or the court itself (as in quantum meruit or quantum valebat). Scholars seeking to expand the explanatory power of unjust enrichment have argued that other areas of the law such as subrogation and claims to traceable substitutes form part of the law of unjust enrichment. This view has been accepted, though its implications remain unclear. * In Australian law, actions derived from the common money counts continue to generate only personal remedies. The doctrinal basis of subrogation is not unsettled: it has nothing to do with unjust enrichment.Bofinger v Kingsway [2009 HCA 44] Claims to traceable substitutes are a part of our law of property, not unjust enrichment. National systems = Australia = Whether there is a distinct body of law in Australia known as the law of unjust enrichment is a highly controversial question. In Pavey & Mathews v Paul (1987) 162 CLR 221 the concept of unjust enrichment was expressly endorsed by the High Court of Australia. This was subsequently followed in numerous first instance and appellate decisions, as well as by the High Court itself. Considerable skepticism about the utility of the concept of unjust enrichment has been expressed in recent years. The equitable basis for the action for money had and received has instead been emphasised and in Australian Financial v Hills [2014 HCA 14] the plurality held that the concept of unjust enrichment was effectively 'inconsistent' with the law of restitution as it had developed in Australia. It is worth noting that the analytic framework had been expressly endorsed by the High Court just two years before in Equuscorp v Haxton [2012 HCA 7]. For the moment, the concept of unjust enrichment appears to serve only a taxonomical function.Equuscorp v Haxton [2012 HCA 7]; Lampson v Fortescue Metals (No 3) [2014 WASC 162] (Edelman J). =Belgium= The acceptance of the unjust enrichment has been confirmed multiple times in Belgium by the Court of Cassation, which has ruled that the unjust enrichment is a general principle of law.Cass. 17 November 1983, RW 1983-84, 2982.Cass. 7 September 2001, Cah.dr.immo 2002, 18.Cass. 19 January 2009, RCJB 2012, 69. The Court has stated that the legal basis for the unjust enrichment is equity. According to the Court, five elements constitute the unjust enrichment: #an enrichment; #an impoverishment; #a connection between the enrichment and the impoverishment; #an absence of a cause of the enrichment; #the person trying to invoke the unjust enrichment cannot invoke the negotiorum gestio or the undue payment. =United Kingdom= The law of unjust enrichment in England rapidly developed during the second half of the 20th century. It has been heavily influenced by the writings of jurists from Oxford and Cambridge.See, e.g., Commerzbank v Gareth Price-Jones [2004] EWCA Civ 1663 at [47] (Mummery LJ). England adopts the \\"unjust factor\\" approach. In Scotland, the law developed in a piecemeal fashion through the twentieth century, culminating in three pivotal cases in the late 1990s. The most crucial of these was Shilliday v Smith, in which Lord Roger essentially laid the bedrock for what is now considered modern Scots unjustified enrichment law, bringing together the fragmented law into one framework, drawing from the principles of Roman Law upon which Scots Law as a whole is based (note the term \\"unjustified\\" is preferred to \\"unjust\\" in Scotland). Unjustified enrichment is more established as a fundamental part of the Scots law of obligations than unjust enrichment is in English law. = United States = The Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment states that unjust enrichment is enrichment that lacks an adequate legal basis. It results from a transfer that the law treats as ineffective to work a conclusive alteration in ownership rights.Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, ¬ß1, comment b (Discussion Draft 2000) The North Dakota Supreme Court has ruled that five elements must be established to prove unjust enrichment:Schroeder v. Buchholz, 2001 ND 36, 622 N.W.2d 202 * An enrichment * An impoverishment * A connection between enrichment and the impoverishment * Absence of a justification for the enrichment and impoverishment * An absence of a remedy provided by the law Effectively, the civil law doctrine is now in effect in North Dakota, as it has been in Louisiana and in Puerto Rico; both of which are mixed jurisdictions. In Massachusetts, there are some decisions denying recovery in restitution by the breaching party although this is not generally the rule in the United States. In 1999, unspent funds incorrectly deposited during 1998 into a wrong bank account were frozen when a judge ruled it was unjust enrichment; the unintended recipient sued. =Canada= The doctrine of unjust enrichment was definitively established as a full fletched course of action in Canada in Pettkus v. Becker, 1980 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1980 2 SCR 834] To establish unjust enrichment, the Plaintiff needs to show: (i) enrichment; (ii) deprivation; (iii) causal connection between enrichment and deprivation; and (iv) absence of juristic justification for the enrichment . The concept of deprivation and enrichment are extremely broad. Deprivation refers to any loss of money or money's worth in the form of contribution while A is enriched if B contributes to the acquisition of assets in A's name . The causal connection between enrichment and deprivation must be \\"substantial and direct\\" . The absence of juristic reason is satisfied if a Plaintiff establishes a reason why the benefit ought not be retained, or if the Defendant demonstrates a convincing argument in favour of retention of the property . Remedy for unjust enrichment is frequently an imposition of constructive trust over the property unjustly retained .

He was defeated in his bid for re-election by Ciro Rodriguez, a former Democratic member of Congress, in a special election runoff held on December 12, 2006. His term expired January 3, 2007 when the 110th Congress officially began. Roots in San Antonio Bonilla was born in San Antonio, the son of Anita Arellano and Enrique A. Bonilla.1 \\"Henry Bonilla,\\" Rootsweb.com. When he was young he joined a TRIO Educational Talent Search program, which provides academic support and college awareness activities to students. He graduated from South San Antonio High School in 1972 and received his Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1976. Before entering politics, he was a television news executive at San Antonio's CBS affiliate, KENS-TV. His former wife, Deborah Knapp (born December 1, 1954), continues as an anchor at the station. He has since married the former Sheryl White Shelby (born 1959). Congressional career In March 1992, Bonilla won the 23rd district's Republican nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives (map). The 23rd had been a Democratic district since its creation in 1967, but Bonilla charged four-term incumbent Albert G. Bustamante with neglecting his constituents' needs, being involved in the House banking scandal by writing 30 \\"cheques calientes\\" in the House Bank, and taking excessive and questionable junkets abroad. Bonilla got an inadvertent assist from the state legislature, which left a heavily Republican area of western San Antonio in the 23rd while carving the new 28th District out of much of the 23rd's territory. Despite being outspent by $758,453 to $594,032 and being in a district that Bill Clinton carried the same year, Bonilla won by a huge 21-point margin, 59 to 38 percent, the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent that year. In March 1999, Governor George W. Bush named Bonilla as the only Texan on his presidential exploratory committee. Bonilla often represented Bush on national news programs and as a surrogate speaker. Although the 23rd had a slight Democratic lean, Bonilla developed a very conservative voting record. Largely because of his popularity in San Antonio, he did not face a credible challenge until 2002, when Democrat Henry Cuellar, a former Texas secretary of state, came within two points of unseating him. Bonilla announced that he would probably run in 2006 for the United States Senate seat held by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison if she ran for governor in 2006 against the incumbent Republican Rick Perry. However, Hutchison decided to run for another term in the Senate. American Dream PAC When Bonilla took charge in 1999 of an independent political fund called American Dream PAC, he made clear that its mission was to \\"give significant, direct financial assistance to first-rate minority GOP candidates\\". However, between 1999 and the end of 2003, only $48,750 (or 8.9 percent) of the $547,000 the PAC has received, has gone to minority office-seekers, while more than $100,000 has been routed to Republican Party organizations or causes. Bonilla defends his PAC's record of assisting minority candidates, saying, \\"We did the best we could.\\" In all, 27 minority office-seekers, predominantly Hispanic-American, received money, mostly small donations. But Bonilla said it was sometimes difficult to find \\"good, solid minority candidates to expend the funds on\\". In July 2003, the treasurer of the PAC pleaded guilty to embezzling $119,021 between 1999 and 2003 and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. The thefts were not discovered until almost four years after they began. \\"It was a black mark on my judgment\\", Bonilla said in a 2004 interview. 2003 redistricting Bonilla was priming for a rematch against Cuellar in 2004, but in 2003, a controversial mid-decade redistricting by the Texas legislature, the results of efforts by U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, moved most of Laredo, which had been one of the cores of the 23rd since its formation, to the 28th district. In its place, Bonilla received several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs that had previously been in the nearby 21st District, all but assuring him of a seventh term. Meanwhile, Cuellar entered and won the 2004 primary against the 28th's incumbent Democrat Ciro Rodriguez and then went on to win the general election. Bonilla contributed money from his American Dream PAC to the redistricting effort. Soon after the 2004 election, Bonilla was criticized when he proposed a procedural rule change that would permit House leaders to retain their leadership positions despite having been indicted by a state grand jury. The proposal would have allowed Tom DeLay to remain as Majority Leader despite having been indicted by the Travis County district attorney's office for possible campaign finance violations. Many constituents believed that Bonilla was blatantly repaying a political favor to DeLay for having favorably redrawn the 23rd District. On June 29, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Anthony Kennedy taking the lead, ruled in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry that Bonilla's district violated the Civil Rights Act, although the justices upheld most of the 2003 redistricting. The Court declared that the Texas legislature violated the rights of Latino voters when it cut most of Laredo out of the 23rd. Although the reconfigured 23rd was still 55 percent Latino, only 46 percent of the district's voting-age population was Latino. The justices held that as a result, the new district didn't have enough Latinos to pass muster under the Voting Rights Act. Since the legislature hadn't created an acceptable majority-Latino district (its intended replacement, the Austin-to-McAllen 25th, was not considered compact enough), the reconfigured 23rd had to be struck down as well. Because of the size of the 23rd, the ruling effectively forced the redrawing of nearly every district from El Paso to San Antonio. Precedent dictated that a new map had to be issued before the November elections. The court issued the new lines on August 7. It moved all of Laredo out of the 23rd and into the 28th, but nevertheless made the district much friendlier to Democrats by boosting its Latino population to 65 percent. In particular, Bonilla lost many of the strongly Republican areas he had inherited in the 2003 redistricting. At the same time, he picked up much of heavily Democratic south San Antonio. Bonilla had grown up in this area, which had been part of the 23rd from 1967-93. The court ordered an all-party primary on Election Day, with a December runoff if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote. The new map included Rodriguez' home and much of his former base, and he announced that he would run against Bonilla in November. Federal Elections Commission records show Bonilla paid the Los Angeles-based law firm of Latham & Watkins $100,000 in 2006, from his campaign funds, to argue that the district boundaries were constitutional. In February, the firm filed an amicus brief before the Supreme Court in support of the redistricting plan. Defeat in 2006 On November 7, Bonilla faced six Democrats, including Ciro Rodriguez and Vietnam War veteran Rick Bolanos in the all-candidate special election required by the court decision on redistricting (see above). The ballot also included one independent. Bolanos had won the Democratic primary earlier in the year. In the first special election, Bonilla won 48 percent of the vote to Rodriguez's 20 percent. Since no one gained a majority, there was a runoff between the two former colleagues. Rodriguez won the runoff with 54% of the vote to Bonilla's 46%.http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electioninfo/2006election.pdf Bonilla was the first Republican incumbent in Texas to be unseated by a Democrat in 10 years, since Nick Lampson's defeat of Steve Stockman in a 1996 runoff election. Lampson was also returned to Congress in 2006 after being defeated for reelection in 2004, like Rodriguez in another district. Bonilla said in interviews the night of his defeat that his loss was in part a result of the changed districting. He ran controversial commercials that claimed that Rodriguez took funds from terrorists, which media outlets called \\"bold claims\\". He later apologized to the press for any of those who took offense, but stood by his statement. The Henry Bonilla Healthcare Facility off Texas State Highway 359 South in Laredo, Texas However, a large number of Hispanics and Latinos, who predominantly reside in District 23, had expressed disdain for Bonilla by stating that he had fallen out of touch with the needs and concerns of minorities. His reputation even earned him the nickname \\"Henry Vanilla\\", as some Hispanics claimed that Bonilla no longer could relate to his culture. In a year of war, illegal immigration issues, and a proposed border fence, Latinos left the Republicans side in droves. Failed nomination as ambassador After his term in Congress expired, Bonilla was nominated to be Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the Organization of American States, with the rank of Ambassador. After two months with no action by the Senate, Bonilla asked U.S. President George W. Bush to withdraw his nomination. Following the withdrawal of his ambassador nomination, Bonilla joined the Washington-based firm The Normandy Group. Consideration for Trump Cabinet In December 2016, Bonilla and two other Texas Republicans, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and Miller's predecessor in that office, Susan Combs, were interviewed for the position of United States Secretary of Agriculture in the Trump Administration.San Antonio Express-News, December 31, 2016, pg. 1.

It was a style that spread worldwide, as car designers picked up styling trends from the US automobile industry, where it was regarded as the \\"golden age\\" of American auto design.pbs.org General Motors design chief Harley Earl is often credited for the automobile tailfin, introducing small fins on the 1948 Cadillac, but according to many sources the actual inventor/designer of the tailfin for the 1948 Cadillac was Franklin Quick Hershey, who at the time the 1948 Cadillac was being designed was chief of the GM Special Car Design Studio. It was Hershey who after seeing an early production model of a P-38 at Selfridge air base thought the twin rudders of the airplane would make a sleek design addition to the rear of future modern automobiles. http://www.100megsfree4.com/cadillac/cad1940/cad48s.htm Tailfins took particular hold on the automotive buying public‚Äôs imagination as a result of Chrysler designer Virgil Exner‚Äôs Forward Look, which subsequently resulted in manufacturers scrambling to install larger and larger tailfins onto new models. As jet-powered aircraft, rockets, and space flight entered into public recognition, the automotive tailfin assemblies (including tail lights) were designed to resemble more and more the tailfin and engine sections of contemporary jet fighters and space rockets. Plymouth claimed that the tailfins were not fins, but \\"stabilizers\\" to place the \\"center of pressure\\" as far to the rear as possible and thus \\"reduce by 20% the needs for steering correction in a cross wind\\",Allpar.com while Mercedes-Benz called its own tailfins , sight lines that ostensibly aided in backing up. Background Automobile engineer Paul Jaray added a center fin to his prototype designs in the 1920s for aerodynamic stability. Influenced by his patents some car producers made streamlined prototypes with one center positioned tailfin. For example, the Audi F5 Stromliner prototype, Kdf-Wagen prototype, Tatra T77 production car or Fiat Padovan prototype. Some sub-models of the 1937 Cadillac Fleetwood, which predates the P-38, also contained hints of tailfins via projecting tail-light \\"paddles\\", although it is unclear if this influenced later fin designs.http://www.100megsfree4.com/cadillac/cad1940/cad48s.htm The 1941 Cadillac Series 63 4-Door Sedan also had a form of jutting tail-lights, although milder than the 1937 Fleetwood. Even though the 1948 model was the first conscious effort at fins, the earlier partial occurrences may have made the concept more acceptable to consumers and designers. (World War II produced a gap of Cadillac model production between the early 1940s and late 1940s as factories turned to military goods production, interrupting the development of the fin concept.) Tailfin era The Cadillac 1948 fin styling proved popular, and its use spread to other models in the General Motors family of brands. Soon it was adopted by other manufacturers, with top Chrysler stylist Virgil Exner in particular taking the tailfin look on board. As confidence grew in the styling trend, the fins grew larger and bolder. The most extreme tailfins appeared in the late 1950s, such as on the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado and the 1959 Chevrolet Impala. The 1959 Cadillac fins looked like jet airplane vertical stabilizers with sharp points and twin bullet-shaped taillights. Many of automotive press and much of the public were getting weary of the exaggerated tailfins, and the manufacturers were ready to phase them out because they added cost and complexity to design and manufacturing. Tailfins descended throughout the early 1960s, even adopting a downward slope on the 1965 Cadillacs. Mostly they disappeared and are replaced with a new style of taillights of today's called, lobster-claw taillights, although in instances a sharp-edged quarter panel meeting a downward sloping trunk created the look if not illusion of fins. Vestigial tailfins, however, remained on American cars into the 1990s, at least as far as the 1999 Cadillac Deville. Mercedes-Benz introduced a modest tailfin on its 1959 W111 series of sedans, which gained the nickname \\"Fintails\\". In company terminology, they were , sight lines that aid backing up. In 1997, Lancia introduced the Lancia Kappa Coup√© with similar rear \\"sight line\\" augmentation.

Since the Ambassador's exterior design remained virtually unchanged for nearly sixty years, the tailfins were retained for the duration of its production Tailfins have been criticized as a safety concern, even as a parked vehicle. In Kahn v. Chrysler (1963), a seven-year-old child on a bicycle collided with a fin and sustained a head injury. A case of the same era, Hatch v. Ford (1958), is also prominent in the study of personal injury from parked vehicles. In both of these cases, children were injured by sharp protrusions on parked cars.Jain, S.

Recent Cadillacs have continued the tradition of the brand's signature vertical taillamp tailfins. Cadillac's designers call the current Cadillacs's styling evocative of tailfins. In 2010, the Cadillac SRX styling incorporated the trademark vertical taillights sculpted into tiny tailfins projecting from the rear. This was also done with the Cadillac XTS, which launched in 2012, and with many other models in later years. In 2009 Trabant introduced the Nt concept with distinct tail fins projecting from the rear similar to the earlier models made the Trabant company. The Chrysler 300 from 2011 to the present has subtle, but noticeable tailfins. Though not officially mentioned by the manufacturer, reviews from the media compared the sharp angles of the fourth generation Toyota Prius tail-lights similar to tailfins. This is better seen when the tail-lights are lit.

History The AirCare emissions program was started in order to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles. Many car models had to pass yearly or biyearly AirCare inspections. The aim was to prevent old cars with high emissions from driving on the road without necessary repairs, thus protecting the air quality and lowering British Columbia's carbon footprint. AirCare was not considered a for-profit program, and charged just enough to cover its costs. For example, in 2013 AirCare was charging $45 per test, but at the start of 2014 demand and therefore cost for the AirCare emissions test dropped to $36. In 2014, the price continued to drop $2 a month, and by December 2014, as the program was about to be cancelled, the price had dropped to $14. =Start of Program= 250x250px The AirCare emissions program was first started in 1992. The aim of this program was to actively monitor all vehicle emissions, and prevent cars with high levels of emissions from driving on the road. This was meant to decrease emissions and allow BC residents to breathe cleaner air. When AirCare was originally passed, all cars manufactured in 1991 or prior had to undergo AirCare evaluation and obtain a passing result yearly. Cars made in 1992 or later had to undergo inspection and obtain a passing result every two years. In order to check if a vehicle needed inspection, any vehicle owner could consult their Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) notice to renew document which would have contained the new AirCare \\"pass\\" date required to renew a vehicle owner's insurance. =AirCare Testing= Each vehicle type and model year tested for AirCare had its own pass/fail criteria that were dependent on the emissions standards at the time said vehicle was built. AirCare tested for levels of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and diesel particulates. Certain vehicles that were considered light-duty were exempt from AirCare. Such vehicles included: * vehicle models newer than 2006 * vehicles with vintage or collector plates * motorcycles, snowmobiles, amphibious vehicles and ATVs * farm fleet and agricultural vehicles * motor homes with a net vehicles weight over 3500 kg * electric vehicles =Testing Sites= Testing sites were provided by Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) and other insurance offices, as well as private licensed mechanics and auto-shops. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) goal was to make testing sites accessible to all residents, and many Greater Vancouver areas had their own testing sites. A few testing sites are listed below in order to illustrate AirCare testing site accessibility: * Abbotsford: 3380 McCallum Road * Chilliwack: 45730 Airport Road * Coquitlam: 1316 United Blvd. * Langley: 5958 205A Street *Maple Ridge: 11469 Kingston Street * North Vancouver: 1333 Mckeen Ave. * Richmond: 11115 Silversmith Place *Surrey: 7910 130th Street * Vancouver East: 3608 Charles Street * Vancouver South: 728 E. Kent Avenue South Effectiveness of the Program AirCare was effective in preventing high emission vehicles from being legally allowed to drive, and thus reduced vehicle emissions. During the 22 years that the program was in operation, program officials concluded that the program reduced annual emissions by an average of 6,500 tonnes a year. However, AirCare failure rate has been gradually dropping. In 2007, 14% of vehicles that were tested failed AirCare. In 2014, this number dropped to less than 8%. The combination of the reduced emissions of newer cars, and the modifications made to many older cars due to AirCare combined to reduce harmful vehicle emissions. The AirCare program was estimated to have reduced air emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles by 24% or 85 tones per year. Cancellation The AirCare program lost its necessity as emission levels in newer cars fell and the number of older vehicles in use decreased. Criticism of the program as an unnecessary \\"tax-grab\\" did exist, even though no tax dollars were actually sent into the program. Other factors in the decision of its closure include the rising cost of staff and equipment, resulting in higher costs for ICBC programs. In its lifespan, AirCare did see the number of cars failing its test drop overall. =Impact on Drivers= Waiving the necessity of AirCare to purchase car insurance has made the latter more affordable since the program's cancellation. The reaction regarding AirCare's end was mixed. The view of the people who were against the cancellation was that AirCare was essential for older vehicles on the road, and that it should have expanded to safety issues, beyond just an emission program. On the other hand, others were pleased because they could buy cars without having to get a permit first. Commercial trucks that were not tested in the past are now under tests since they mostly run on diesel, which emits more pollution than regular gas. Other Initiatives The British Columbia's innovative Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program (BC SCRAP-IT) is a program that offers distinct incentive which helps reduce high levels of emission and supports alternative forms of transportation: public transit, membership in ride-share or care-share programs (car pool), and/or purchase of a bicycle. Nine things the government is doing to make heavy-duty vehicles cleaner: Ever since the cancellation of AirCare, the government of British Columbia has been working on ways to make heavy-duty vehicles cleaner. They have come up with nine ways. First, the government retrofitted their heavy-duty vehicles and actively promote and use of biodiesel. Second, older models of transit buses were also retrofitted. The transit buses can run up to 30 years of service, even though new and better models come out it was wise to clean the older models so they can be reused. Third, the ministry of education invested $10 million to buy new cleaner school buses. Fourth, the government plans to expand the Aircare to more regions of the provinces for heavy-duty vehicles. Fifth, the government gave out incentives to have big diesels stop idling. Typical inner-city tracker trailers tend to sit idling for 1,800 hours a year, which is equivalent to approximately 75 days of wasting fuel, costing money and burning fuel into the atmosphere. So the government has been working to set up electric charge systems to stop the trailers from running on fuel. Sixth, the government will invest in green vehicle fleets. Green Fleets B.C. (GFBC) will be an important factor on the latest green technologies for private and public sectors. Such as the taxis, emergency vehicles, delivery vans and commercial fleet trucks. GFBC also forms part of the government's climate change strategy, which includes the reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 33% by 2020. Seventh, they will use biodiesel in government diesel vehicles. Biodiesel is reusable fuel that is made from fats and oils of animals and plants. It is often mixed with diesel fuel and can be used in any time that the diesel fuel can be used. Eighth, B.C. government will buy green. British Columbia's government is highly green friendly and is working to incorporate their strategies into buildings, vehicle fleets and the purchase or lease of other goods and services. Finally, the BC government is in Support with Greener ports and marine vessels. Vancouver's ports play a crucial role in the British Columbia's economy. As the ports in Vancouver' are an important asset to the government, the government will work in partnership with the ports and related organizations to test new ways to reduce emissions from port operations. Two additional transportation emission reduction policies and programs led by the province: 1\\\\. The government has stated that they will pass: \\"A new greenhouse gas reduction regulation that offers incentives to utility companies for natural gas transportation fleets - including buses, trucks or ferries, as well as the creation and operation of compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas fuelling stations.\\" CarSharing with Electric Cars 2\\\\. Government invested $2 million to help the businesses exchange their heavy- duty diesel truck and equipment into more fuel efficient machines by setting up a low-interest loan program, which saved money and helped reduce carbon emissions. This plan is estimated to reduce 13,400 tones of emissions over the first three years. The long-term goal for this $17 million plan is to make cleaner energy vehicles, building, charging stations and BC SCRAP-IT society.

She is most famous for her participation in the Battle of Nassau‚Äîthe first amphibious engagement by the Continental Navy and the Continental Marines‚Äîand for being the first United States vessel to receive a salute from a foreign power. Purchase On 13 October 1775, the Continental Congress authorized the purchase of the merchant brig Defiance. The ship was acquired in mid-November and moored in Wharton and Humphreys shipyard in Philadelphia where she was converted into a warship by Joshua Humphreys (hull strengthening), John Barry (re-rigging), and John Falconer (ordnance and provisioning) at a cost of ¬£296.4s.6d. She was named Andrew Doria after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria. Under the command of Captain Nicholas Biddle, Andrew Doria departed Philadelphia on 4 January 1776, as a warship in Esek Hopkins' small fleet of five newly fitted warships (Alfred, Andrew Doria, Cabot, Columbus, and Providence), bound for the Chesapeake Bay. Between 11 and 17 February, the fleet was joined by the small sloop Fly, the sloop Hornet, and the schooner Wasp. Battle of Nassau On 17 February 1776, Hopkins decided to take advantage of the discretion offered him and skip his missions in the Chesapeake Bay and along the coasts of the Carolinas. Instead, he took the fleet to the Bahamas for a raid on the island of New Providence to seize a large supply of gunpowder reportedly stored in the two forts that protected Nassau. On 1 March, the fleet reached the coast of Abaco Island where the ship Alfred captured two small sloops and Hopkins obtained intelligence from the prisoners that New Providence lay undefended. Hopkins planned to take Nassau by frontal assault, slipping his landing party of 270 sailors and marines into the harbor hidden on board the captured sloops. It was hoped that the American troops would not be detected until the landing and assault on Fort Nassau began. Success in this endeavor would enable the fleet to enter the harbor while the fort's guns, then in American hands, held the town at bay. The marines and sailors embarked on the two captured sloops on the evening of 2 March and headed for New Providence, hoping to arrive at daybreak. While following the sloops, the fleet attempted to remain out of sight until the landing party had secured the fort. Andrew Doria‚Äîpopularly referred to as the \\"Black Brig\\"‚Äîoutdistanced her consorts and found it necessary to lay-to until the other American warships caught up. As the troop- carrying sloops headed into the harbor, Fort Nassau's guns opened fire. The shot fell short but demonstrated that the American fleet had been detected and that its intentions had been surmised. Hopkins recalled his ships. After conferring with his officers, Hopkins decided to land his troops two miles (3 km) down the coast from Fort Montagu, which protected the eastern approaches to Nassau. The marines and sailors went ashore on 3 March and marched to Fort Montagu whose garrison surrendered without offering any real resistance. On 4 March, the Americans took Fort Nassau and town of Nassau. The fleet remained for almost two weeks, dismantling the guns of the forts and loading the captured materiel. During this stay, large numbers of the crew of each ship were stricken by a virulent fever. This complicated an already serious health problem caused by an outbreak of smallpox on all of the ships except for Andrew Doria whose crew had been protected by inoculation due to the far- sighted insistence of Nicholas Biddle. As a result of the crew's immunization, Andrew Doria was selected to serve as a hospital ship for the fleet and continued in this role for the remainder of the expedition. On 16 March, Hopkin's fleet departed Nassau and headed north. Battle of Block Island Shortly after midnight on 6 April 1776, a lookout on Andrew Doria sighted two vessels to the southeast. Biddle passed word of the discovery to Hopkins who ordered the fleet to head for the strangers. The larger of the unidentified ships headed toward the Americans and before long she was within hailing distance and identified herself as \\"... his majesty's ship of war Glasgow....\\" A broadside from Cabot into the British frigate opened a fierce fight in which the American ships were unable to fight as a squadron. In attempting to avoid a salvo from Glasgow, Cabot crossed Andrew Doria's bow, forcing Biddle's brig onto a port tack which avoided collision but took her away from the action. Meanwhile, Alfred and Columbus, Hopkins' largest warships, took on Glasgow but received worse punishment than they inflicted. As the crew of Andrew Doria worked the ship into position to reenter the engagement and opened fire, Glasgow's captain realized he was overmatched and decided to stand off to the northward. Andrew Doria, followed at a distance by her consorts, gave chase and kept up a running fight with her bow chasers until recalled by Hopkins, lest Glasgow lead his fleet to a Royal Navy squadron then operating in Rhode Island waters. When the American fleet had reformed, it retired to New London, Connecticut, where it arrived on the morning of 8 April. Change of command From 9 April to 17 September 1776, Andrew Doria patrolled the Atlantic coast from Connecticut to Bermuda, capturing a number of British and Loyalist ships. Capt. Biddle anchored his brig at Chester, Pennsylvania, on the evening of 17 September, ending his last cruise on the warship, as he had been selected to command Randolph, one of the four new frigates being built at Philadelphia for the Continental Navy. Capt. Isaiah Robinson took command of Andrew Doria. First salute Fort Oranje on the island of Sint Eustatius fired the first salute by a foreign power to Andrew Doria. Robinson sailed Andrew Doria down the Delaware River on 17 October 1776, for a voyage to the West Indies to obtain a cargo of munitions and military supplies at the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius. When the brig reached the island on 16 November, she fired a 13-gun salute and received a reply from Fort Oranje‚Äîthe first salute to an American flag on board an American warship in a foreign port. Andrew Doria also carried a copy of the Declaration of Independence to the island. The so-called \\"first salute\\" was widely reported in the United States at the time, and later provided the title for Barbara Tuchman's 1988 book, The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution. On her way back to the Delaware River, Andrew Doria encountered the sloop HMS Racehorse, of 10 guns, and under the command of Commander James Jones. A two-hour single-ship action ensued before Racehorse struck. Andrew Doria had lost four men killed and eight wounded; casualties on Racehorse apparently were higher. Andrew Doria encountered a British snow and assigned Joshua Barney to return the ship to Philadelphia, but was captured with a fouled rudder off Chincoteage by . The captain released Barney on pardon in Charleston to return to Philadelphia on foot over 19 days. Andrew Doria returned to Philadelphia where the Continental Navy acquired Racehorse, which it renamed Surprise.Maclay & Smith (1894), pp. 45‚Äì6. Scuttling Andrew Doria was stationed in the Delaware River through the spring and summer of 1777. After Vice Admiral Lord Howe brought his British fleet into the river in September 1777, Andrew Doria was part of the forces charged with defending Philadelphia. Following the British occupation of Fort Mifflin on 16 November, Andrew Doria, with the remaining ships of the Continental Navy, sought shelter under the guns of Fort Mercer, at Red Bank, New Jersey. With the evacuation of Fort Mercer on 20 November, Robinson gave orders the next day for the ships to be burned to prevent capture. This was done shortly thereafter. Replica The not-for-profit organization Andrew Doria ‚Äì The First Salute, Inc., is raising funds to build a working replica of Andrew Doria. On 18 May 2009, the city council of Havre de Grace, Maryland, agreed to lease land to the organization for the construction of a shipyard which will be located near the Susquehanna Museum at the Lockhouse on the banks of the Susquehanna River.

Among Indo-European peoples, astrology has been dated to the 3rd millennium BC, with roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.Koch-Westenholz (1995) Foreword and p.11. Until the 17th century, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition, and it helped drive the development of astronomy. It was commonly accepted in political and cultural circles, and some of its concepts were used in other traditional studies, such as alchemy, meteorology and medicine.Kassell and Ralley (2010) ‚ÄòStars, spirits, signs: towards a history of astrology 1100‚Äì1800'; pp.67‚Äì69. By the end of the 17th century, emerging scientific concepts in astronomy, such as heliocentrism, undermined the theoretical basis of astrology, which subsequently lost its academic standing and became regarded as a pseudoscience. Empirical scientific investigation has shown that predictions and recommendations based on these systems are not accurate. In the 20th century, astrology gained broader consumer popularity through the influence of regular mass media products, such as newspaper horoscopes.Campion (2009) pp.259‚Äì263, for the popularizing influence of newspaper astrology; pp. 239‚Äì249: for association with New Age philosophies. Astrology, in its broadest sense, is the search for human meaning in the sky; it seeks to understand general and specific human behavior through the influence of planets and other celestial objects. It has been argued that astrology began as a study as soon as human beings made conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles.Campion (2008) pp.1-3. Early evidence of such practices appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago; the first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organizing a communal calendar.Marshack (1972) p.81ff. With the Neolithic agricultural revolution new needs were also met by increasing knowledge of constellations, whose appearances in the night-time sky change with the seasons, allowing the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities.Hesiod ( 8th century BC). Hesiod‚Äôs poem Works and Days demonstrates how the heliacal rising and setting of constellations were used as a calendrical guide to agricultural events, from which were drawn mundane astrological predictions, e.g.: ‚ÄúFifty days after the solstice, when the season of wearisome heat is come to an end, is the right time to go sailing. Then you will not wreck your ship, nor will the sea destroy the sailors, unless Poseidon the Earth-Shaker be set upon it, or Zeus, the king of the deathless gods‚Äù (II. 663-677). By the 3rd millennium BC, widespread civilisations had developed sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and are believed to have consciously oriented their temples to create alignment with the heliacal risings of the stars.Kelley and Milone (2005) p.268. There is scattered evidence to suggest that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made during this period, particularly in Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia). Two, from the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa (compiled in Babylon round 1700 BC) are reported to have been made during the reign of king Sargon of Akkad (2334-2279 BC).Two texts which refer to the 'omens of Sargon' are reported in E. F. Weidner, ‚ÄòHistoriches Material in der Babyonischen Omina-Literatur‚Äô Altorientalische Studien, ed. Bruno Meissner, (Leipzig, 1928-9), v. 231 and 236. Another, showing an early use of electional astrology, is ascribed to the reign of the Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash (c. 2144 - 2124 BC). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple.From scroll A of the ruler Gudea of Lagash, I 17 ‚Äì VI 13. O. Kaiser, Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments, Bd. 2, 1-3. G√ºtersloh, 1986-1991. Also quoted in A. Falkenstein, ‚ÄòWahrsagung in der sumerischen √úberlieferung‚Äô, La divination en M√©sopotamie ancienne et dans les r√©gions voisines. Paris, 1966. However, controversy attends the question of whether they were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records that emerge from the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950-1651 BC). Ancient world Detail of the Ishtar Gate in BabylonBabylonian astrology was the first organized system of astrology, arising in the 2nd millennium BC.Holden (1996) p.1. There is speculation that astrology of some form appeared in the Sumerian period in the 3rd millennium BC, but the isolated references to ancient celestial omens dated to this period are not considered sufficient evidence to demonstrate an integrated theory of astrology.Rochberg (1998) p.ix. See also, Neugebauer (1969) pp.29-30. The history of scholarly celestial divination is therefore generally reported to begin with late Old Babylonian texts ( 1800 BC), continuing through the Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian periods ( 1200 BC).Rochberg (1998) p.x. By the 16th century BC the extensive employment of omen-based astrology can be evidenced in the compilation of a comprehensive reference work known as Enuma Anu Enlil. Its contents consisted of 70 cuneiform tablets comprising 7,000 celestial omens. Texts from this time also refer to an oral tradition - the origin and content of which can only be speculated upon.Baigent (1994) p.71. At this time Babylonian astrology was solely mundane, concerned with the prediction of weather and political matters, and prior to the 7th century BC the practitioners' understanding of astronomy was fairly rudimentary. Astrological symbols likely represented seasonal tasks, and were used as a yearly almanac of listed activities to remind a community to do things appropriate to the season or weather (such as symbols representing times for harvesting, gathering shell-fish, fishing by net or line, sowing crops, collecting or managing water reserves, hunting, and seasonal tasks critical in ensuring the survival of children and young animals for the larger group). By the 4th century, their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy, at which point extensive ephemerides began to appear.Holden (1996) p.9. Babylonian astrology developed within the context of divination. A collection of 32 tablets with inscribed liver models, dating from about 1875 BC, are the oldest known detailed texts of Babylonian divination, and these demonstrate the same interpretational format as that employed in celestial omen analysis.Koch-Westenholz (1995) p.16. Blemishes and marks found on the liver of the sacrificial animal were interpreted as symbolic signs which presented messages from the gods to the king. The gods were also believed to present themselves in the celestial images of the planets or stars with whom they were associated. Evil celestial omens attached to any particular planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented.Koch-Westenholz (1995) p.11. Such indications were met with attempts to appease the god and find manageable ways by which the god's expression could be realised without significant harm to the king and his nation. An astronomical report to the king Esarhaddon concerning a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute kings, or substitute events, combined an unquestioning belief in magic and omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must have some kind of correlate within the natural world: Ulla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book Mesopotamian Astrology, argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its heavy reliance on magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of revenge, and so ‚Äúshares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations‚Äù.Koch-Westenholz (1995) p.13. Koch- Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation.Koch-Westenholz (1995) p.19. mundane astrology is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology. It was only with the gradual emergence of horoscopic astrology, from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of natal astrology. Hellenistic Egypt In 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, historian Tamsyn Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the Egyptian zodiac, which shared two signs ‚Äì the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the Dendera Zodiac (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion's Claws).Barton (1994) p. 24. After the occupation by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, Egypt came under Hellenistic rule and influence. The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the scholars of Alexandria were prolific writers. It was in Ptolemaic Alexandria that Babylonian astrology was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of Decanic astrology to create Horoscopic astrology. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary exaltations, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. Along with this it incorporated the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and four elements.Holden (1996) pp. 11-13. The decans were a system of time measurement according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into ‚Äòhours‚Äô. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over the course of the year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.Barton (1994) p. 20. The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the Dendera Zodiac. Particularly important in the development of horoscopic astrology was the astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria in Egypt. Ptolemy's work the Tetrabiblos laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition, and as a source of later reference is said to have \\"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\\".Robbins, Ptolemy Tetrabiblos, 'Introduction' p. xii. It was one of the first astrological texts to be circulated in Medieval Europe after being translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Tivoli (Tiburtinus) in Spain, 1138.FA Robbins, 1940; Thorndike 1923) According to Firmicus Maternus (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named Nechepso and his priest Petosiris.Firmicus (4th century) (III.4) 'Proemium'. The Hermetic texts were also put together during this period and Clement of Alexandria, writing in the Roman era, demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites: > This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the > Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music. For they say that he must > learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the > gods, the second the regulations for the king's life.

Greece and Rome The conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to the cultures and cosmological ideas of Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Greek overtook cuneiform script as the international language of intellectual communication and part of this process was the transmission of astrology from cuneiform to Greek.Campion (2008) p. 173. Sometime around 280 BC, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of Kos in order to teach astrology and Babylonian culture to the Greeks. With this, what historian Nicholas Campion calls, \\"the innovative energy\\" in astrology moved west to the Hellenistic world of Greece and Egypt.Campion (2008) p. 84. According to Campion, the astrology that arrived from the Eastern World was marked by its complexity, with different forms of astrology emerging. By the 1st century BC two varieties of astrology were in existence, one that required the reading of horoscopes in order to establish precise details about the past, present and future; the other being theurgic (literally meaning 'god- work'), which emphasised the soul's ascent to the stars. While they were not mutually exclusive, the former sought information about the life, while the latter was concerned with personal transformation, where astrology served as a form of dialogue with the Divine.Campion (2008) pp.173-174. As with much else, Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to Rome.Barton (1994) p.32. However, our earliest references to demonstrate its arrival in Rome reveal its initial influence upon the lower orders of society, and display concern about uncritical recourse to the ideas of Babylonian 'star-gazers'.Campion (2008) pp.227-228. Among the Greeks and Romans, Babylonia (also known as Chaldea) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' came to be a common synonym for divination using planets and stars.Parkers (1983) p.16. The first definite reference to astrology comes from the work of the orator Cato, who in 160 BC composed a treatise warning farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans.Barton (1994) p.32-33. See also Campion (2008) pp.228. The 2nd-century Roman poet Juvenal, in his satirical attack on the habits of Roman women, also complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, despite their lowly social status, saying \\"Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from Hammon's fountain, ... nowadays no astrologer has credit unless he has been imprisoned in some distant camp, with chains clanking on either arm\\".Juvenal, Satire 6: 'The Ways of Women' (translated by G. G. Ramsay, 1918, retrieved 5 July 2012). One of the first astrologers to bring Hermetic astrology to Rome was Thrasyllus, who, in the first century CE, acted as the astrologer for the emperor Tiberius. Tiberius was the first emperor reported to have had a court astrologer,Barton (1994) p.43. although his predecessor Augustus had also used astrology to help legitimise his Imperial rights.Barton (1994) p.63. In the second century CE, the astrologer Claudius Ptolemy was so obsessed with getting horoscopes accurate that he began the first attempt to make an accurate world map (maps before this were more relativistic or allegorical) so that he could chart the relationship between the person's birthplace and the heavenly bodies. While doing so, he coined the term \\"geography\\".Thompson, Clive. \\"The Whole World in your Hands\\". Smithsonian, July 2017. p. 19. Even though some use of astrology by the emperors appears to have happened, there was also a prohibition on astrology to a certain extent as well. In the 1st century CE, Publius Rufus Anteius was accused of the crime of funding the banished astrologer Pammenes, and requesting his own horoscope and that of then emperor Nero. For this crime, Nero forced Anteius to commit suicide. At this time, astrology was likely to result in charges of magic and treason. Cicero's De divinatione (44 BCE), which rejects astrology and other allegedly divinatory techniques, is a fruitful historical source for the conception of scientificity in Roman classical Antiquity. The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus compiled the ancient arguments against astrology in his book Against the Astrologers.Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy \\"Hellenistic Astrology\\" https://www.iep.utm.edu/astr-hel/#SH5b Islamic world Astrology was taken up enthusiastically by Islamic scholars following the collapse of Alexandria to the Arabs in the 7th century, and the founding of the Abbasid empire in the 8th century. The second Abbasid caliph, Al Mansur (754-775) founded the city of Baghdad to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as Bayt al-Hikma ‚ÄòStorehouse of Wisdom‚Äô, which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic translations of Hellenistic astrological texts.Houlding (2010) Ch. 8: 'The medieval development of Hellenistic principles concerning aspectual applications and orbs'; pp.12-13. The early translators included Mashallah, who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad,Albiruni, Chronology (11th century) Ch.VIII, ‚ÄòOn the days of the Greek calendar‚Äô, re. 23 Tamm√ªz; Sachau. and Sahl ibn Bishr (a.k.a. Zael), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as Guido Bonatti in the 13th century, and William Lilly in the 17th century.Houlding (2010) Ch. 6: 'Historical sources and traditional approaches'; pp.2-7. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the Latin translations of the 12th century. Amongst the important names of Arabic astrologers, one of the most influential was Albumasur, whose work Introductorium in Astronomiam later became a popular treatise in medieval Europe. Another was the Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and geographer Al Khwarizmi. The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the star names that are commonly known today, such as Aldebaran, Altair, Betelgeuse, Rigel and Vega retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic lots to the extent that they became historically known as Arabic parts, for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas they are clearly known to have been an important feature of Hellenistic astrology. During the advance of Islamic science some of the practices of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were conjectural rather than empirical, and conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars through the suggestion that the Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance.Saliba (1994) p.60, pp.67-69. Such refutations mainly concerned 'judicial branches' (such as horary astrology), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as medical and meteorological astrology, these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time. For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology' ResƒÅla fƒ´ eb·π≠ƒÅl a·∏•kƒÅm al- noj≈´m, argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God's absolute power over creation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the capability of determining the exact influence of the stars.Belo (2007) p.228. In essence, Avicenna did not refute the essential dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.George Saliba, Avicenna: 'viii. Mathematics and Physical Sciences'. Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition, 2011, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii Medieval and Renaissance Europe Astrologer-astronomer Richard of Wallingford is shown measuring an equatorium with a pair of compasses in this 14th-century work Whilst astrology in the East flourished following the break up of the Roman world, with Indian, Persian and Islamic influences coming together and undergoing intellectual review through an active investment in translation projects, Western astrology in the same period had become ‚Äúfragmented and unsophisticated ... partly due to the loss of Greek scientific astronomy and partly due to condemnations by the Church.‚ÄùNick Kanas, Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography, p.79 (Springer, 2007). Translations of Arabic works into Latin started to make their way to Spain by the late 10th century, and in the 12th century the transmission of astrological works from Arabia to Europe ‚Äúacquired great impetus‚Äù. By the 13th century astrology had become a part of everyday medical practice in Europe. Doctors combined Galenic medicine (inherited from the Greek physiologist Galen - AD 129-216) with studies of the stars. By the end of the 1500s, physicians across Europe were required by law to calculate the position of the Moon before carrying out complicated medical procedures, such as surgery or bleeding.British Library: Learning Bodies of Knowledge ‚ÄòMedieval Astrology‚Äô https://web.archive.org/web/20130305064820/http://www.bl.uk/learning/artimages/bodies/astrology/astrologyhome.html (25 Octobre 2016) An image related to astrology from the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. It shows the purported relation between body parts and the signs of the zodiac. Influential works of the 13th century include those of the British monk Johannes de Sacrobosco ( 1195‚Äì1256) and the Italian astrologer Guido Bonatti from Forl√¨ (Italy). Bonatti served the communal governments of Florence, Siena and Forl√¨ and acted as advisor to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. His astrological text-book Liber Astronomiae ('Book of Astronomy'), written around 1277, was reputed to be \\"the most important astrological work produced in Latin in the 13th century\\". Dante Alighieri immortalised Bonatti in his Divine Comedy (early 14th century) by placing him in the eighth Circle of Hell, a place where those who would divine the future are forced to have their heads turned around (to look backwards instead of forwards). Ascension tympanum of Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. The central theme is Christ's ascension, but around the edges are the signs of the Zodiac and the Labours of the Months. In medieval Europe, a university education was divided into seven distinct areas, each represented by a particular planet and known as the seven liberal arts. Dante attributed these arts to the planets. As the arts were seen as operating in ascending order, so were the planets in decreasing order of planetary speed: grammar was assigned to the Moon, the quickest moving celestial body, dialectic was assigned to Mercury, rhetoric to Venus, music to the Sun, arithmetic to Mars, geometry to Jupiter and astrology/astronomy to the slowest moving body, Saturn.Burckhardt (1969) Medieval writers used astrological symbolism in their literary themes. For example, Dante's Divine Comedy builds varied references to planetary associations within his described architecture of Hell, Purgatory and Paradise, (such as the seven layers of Purgatory's mountain purging the seven cardinal sins that correspond to astrology's seven classical planets).Crane (2012) pp.81-85. Similar astrological allegories and planetary themes are pursued through the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Chaucer's astrological passages are particularly frequent and knowledge of astrological basics is often assumed through his work. He knew enough of his period's astrology and astronomy to write a Treatise on the Astrolabe for his son. He pinpoints the early spring season of the Canterbury Tales in the opening verses of the prologue by noting that the Sun \\"hath in the Ram his halfe cours yronne\\".Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales, Prologue He makes the Wife of Bath refer to \\"sturdy hardiness\\" as an attribute of Mars, and associates Mercury with \\"clerkes\\".C. S. Lewis, The Discarded Image (Cambridge University Press, 1964; ) pp. 106-107. In the early modern period, astrological references are also to be found in the works of William Shakespeare and John Milton. One of the earliest English astrologers to leave details of his practice was Richard Trewythian (b. 1393). His notebook demonstrates that he had a wide range of clients, from all walks of life, and indicates that engagement with astrology in 15th-century England was not confined to those within learned, theological or political circles.Sophie Page, 'Richard Trewythian and the Uses of Astrology in Late Medieval England', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes Vol. 64, (2001), pp. 193-228. Published by The Warburg Institute. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/751562. During the Renaissance, court astrologers would complement their use of horoscopes with astronomical observations and discoveries. Many individuals now credited with having overturned the old astrological order, such as Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler, were themselves practicing astrologers.Wade Rowland, Galileo's Mistake: A New Look At the Epic Confrontation Between Galileo and the Church, p.39. (Arcade Publishing, 2003. . Brahe is described as \\"an acknowledged master of astrology\\", Galileo as \\"a dabbler, though by no means an adept\\" and it is said of Kepler that \\"astrology informed his entire career\\". At the end of the Renaissance the confidence placed in astrology diminished, with the breakdown of Aristotelian Physics and rejection of the distinction between the celestial and sublunar realms, which had historically acted as the foundation of astrological theory. Keith Thomas writes that although heliocentrism is consistent with astrology theory, 16th and 17th century astronomical advances meant that \\"the world could no longer be envisaged as a compact inter-locking organism; it was now a mechanism of infinite dimensions, from which the hierarchical subordination of earth to heaven had irrefutably disappeared\\".Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century England (Oxford University Press, 1971) p. 414-415, Initially, amongst the astronomers of the time, \\"scarcely anyone attempted a serious refutation in the light of the new principles\\" and in fact astronomers \\"were reluctant to give up the emotional satisfaction provided by a coherent and interrelated universe\\". By the 18th century the intellectual investment which had previously maintained astrology's standing was largely abandoned. Historian of science Ann Geneva writes: India The earliest use of the term ' is in the sense of a Vedanga, an auxiliary discipline of Vedic religion. The only work of this class to have survived is the Vedanga Jyotisha, which contains rules for tracking the motions of the sun and the moon in the context of a five-year intercalation cycle. The date of this work is uncertain, as its late style of language and composition, consistent with the last centuries BC, albeit pre-Mauryan, conflicts with some internal evidence of a much earlier date in the 2nd millennium BC. p.9 The documented history of Jyotish in the subsequent newer sense of modern horoscopic astrology is associated with the interaction of Indian and Hellenistic cultures in the Indo-Greek period.Pingree (1981), p.81 Greek became a lingua franca of the Indus valley region following the military conquests of Alexander the Great and the Bactrian Greeks. The oldest surviving treatises, such as the Yavanajataka or the Brihat-Samhita, date to the early centuries AD. The oldest astrological treatise in Sanskrit is the Yavanajataka (\\"Sayings of the Greeks\\"), a versification by Sphujidhvaja in 269/270 AD of a now lost translation of a Greek treatise by Yavanesvara during the 2nd century AD under the patronage of the Western Satrap Saka king Rudradaman I.Mc Evilley \\"The shape of ancient thought\\", p385 (\\"The Yavanajataka is the earliest surviving Sanskrit text in horoscopy, and constitute the basis of all later Indian developments in horoscopy\\", himself quoting David Pingree \\"The Yavanajataka of Sphujidhvaja\\" p5) Indian astronomy and astrology developed together. The earliest treatise on jyotish, the Bhrigu Samhita, dates from the Vedic era. The sage Bhrigu is one of the Saptarshi, the seven sages who assisted in the creation of the universe. Written on pages of tree bark, the Samhita (Compilation) is said to contain five million horoscopes comprising all who have lived in the past or will live in the future. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy are from the 5th century AD, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of Aryabhata in the Aryabhatiya and the lost Arya-siddhƒÅnta, there is the Pancha-SiddhƒÅntika of Varahamihira. China An oracle bone ‚Äì turtle shell The Chinese astrological system is based on native astronomy and calendars, and its significant development is tied to that of native astronomy, which came to flourish during the Han Dynasty (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD). Chinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy (theory of three harmonies: heaven, earth and water) and uses the principles of yin and yang, and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the wu xing teachings, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, the lunisolar calendar (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day and shichen (ÊôÇËæ∞). Astrology was traditionally regarded highly in China, and Confucius is said to have treated astrology with respect saying: \\"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\\".Parkers (1983) The 60-year cycle combining the five elements with the twelve animal signs of the zodiac has been documented in China since at least the time of the Shang (Shing or Yin) dynasty (ca 1766 BC ‚Äì ca 1050 BC). Oracle bones have been found dating from that period with the date according to the 60-year cycle inscribed on them, along with the name of the diviner and the topic being divined. Astrologer Tsou Yen lived around 300 BC, and wrote: \\"When some new dynasty is going to arise, heaven exhibits auspicious signs for the people\\". Mesoamerica The calendars of Pre- Columbian Mesoamerica are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. The earliest calendars were employed by peoples such as the Zapotecs and Olmecs, and later by such peoples as the Maya, Mixtec and Aztecs. Although the Mesoamerican calendar did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements to it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood. The distinctive Mayan calendar used two main systems, one plotting the solar year of 360 days, which governed the planting of crops and other domestic matters; the other called the Tzolkin of 260 days, which governed ritual use. Each was linked to an elaborate astrological system to cover every facet of life. On the fifth day after the birth of a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim. A 584-day Venus cycle was also maintained, which tracked the appearance and conjunctions of Venus. Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose. There is evidence that the Maya also tracked the movements of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, and possessed a zodiac of some kind. The Mayan name for the constellation Scorpio was also 'scorpion', while the name of the constellation Gemini was 'peccary'. There is some evidence for other constellations being named after various beasts.Michael D. Coe, 'The Maya', pp. 227‚Äì29, Thames and Hudson, London, 2005 The most famous Mayan astrological observatory still intact is the Caracol observatory in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in modern-day Mexico. The Aztec calendar shares the same basic structure as the Mayan calendar, with two main cycles of 360 days and 260 days. The 260-day calendar was called Tonalpohualli and was used primarily for divinatory purposes. Like the Mayan calendar, these two cycles formed a 52-year 'century', sometimes called the Calendar Round.

It was discovered by Jean-Dominique Maraldi in 1746 and included in Charles Messier's catalogue of comet-like objects in 1764. At an estimated 12.0 billion years old, it is one of the oldest known globular clusters. Characteristics M 15 is about 33,600 light-years from Earth, and 175 light-years in diameter. It has an absolute magnitude of ‚àí9.2, which translates to a total luminosity of 360,000 times that of the Sun. Messier 15 is one of the most densely packed globulars known in the Milky Way galaxy. Its core has undergone a contraction known as \\"core collapse\\" and it has a central density cusp with an enormous number of stars surrounding what may be a central black hole. Home to over 100,000 stars, the cluster is notable for containing a large number of variable stars (112) and pulsars (8), including one double neutron star system, M15-C. It also contains Pease 1, the first planetary nebula discovered within a globular cluster in 1928. Just three others have been found in globular clusters since then. Amateur astronomy At magnitude 6.2, M15 approaches naked eye visibility under good conditions and can be observed with binoculars or a small telescope, appearing as a fuzzy star. Telescopes with a larger aperture (at least 6 in./150 mm diameter) will start to reveal individual stars, the brightest of which are of magnitude +12.6. The cluster appears 18 arc minutes in size. X-ray sources Earth- orbiting satellites Uhuru and Chandra X-ray Observatory have detected two bright X-ray sources in this cluster: Messier 15 X-1 (4U 2129+12) and Messier 15 X-2.

The Dresden Green is a rare Type IIa, with a clarity of VS1 and it is said to be potentially internally flawless, if slightly recut. It is named after Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony, where it has been on display for most of the last two centuries, latterly in the New Green Vault at Dresden Castle. After World War II, it was relocated to Moscow for a decade before being returned to Dresden. In November 2019, it was sent on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City so was not involved in the jewel theft of 25 November.  History  The Dresden Green Diamond has a historical record dating back to 1722, when a London news-sheet carried an article about it in its 25 October-27th edition. It was acquired by Augustus III of Poland from a Dutch merchant in 1742 at the Leipzig Fair. In 1768, the diamond was incorporated into an extremely valuable hat ornament, surrounded by two large and 411 medium-sized and small diamonds.Dirk Syndram, Prunkst√ºcke des Gr√ºnen Gew√∂lbes zu Dresden, 5th ed.

In 2000, American jewelry firm Harry Winston arranged to display the Dresden Green at the New York flagship store and then at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC, United States, where it was displayed in the Harry Winston pavilion next to the largest blue diamond in the world, the Hope Diamond.  Color  The stone's unique apple green color is due to natural exposure to radioactive materials, as the irradiation of diamonds can produce changes in color. The Dresden Green Diamond has been used to compare natural versus lab-produced green diamonds  it is hoped that it can be used to devise a test to differentiate between naturally green diamonds, which are quite rare, and lab-produced ones.

Life Broch was born in Vienna to a prosperous Jewish family and worked for some time in his family's factory, though he maintained his literary interests privately. As the oldest son, he was expected to take over his father‚Äôs textile factory in Teesdorf; therefore, he attended a technical college for textile manufacture and a spinning and weaving college. In 1909 he converted to Roman Catholicism and married Franziska von Rothermann, the daughter of a knighted manufacturer. The following year, their son Hermann Friedrich Maria was born. His marriage ended in divorce in 1923. In 1927 he sold the textile factory and decided to study mathematics, philosophy and psychology at the University of Vienna. He embarked on a full-time literary career only around the age of 40. At the age of 45, his first major literary work, the trilogy The Sleepwalkers, was published by Daniel Brody, for the Rhein Verlag in 1931/1932 in Munich.Hermann Broch ‚Äì Daniel Brody Briefwechsel 1930‚Äì1951 He was acquainted with many of the now well-known writers, intellectuals, and artists of his time, including Robert Musil, Rainer Maria Rilke, Elias Canetti, Leo Perutz, Franz Blei and writer and former nude model Ea von Allesch. With the annexation of Austria by the Nazis (1938), Broch was arrested in the small Alpine town of Bad Aussee for possession of a socialist magazine but was soon released. Shortly thereafter, a movement organized by friends ‚Äì including James Joyce, Thornton Wilder, and his translators Edwin and Willa Muir ‚Äì managed to help him emigrate; first to Britain and then to the United States, where he published his novel The Death of Virgil and his collection of short stories The Guiltless. While in exile, he also continued to write on politics and work on mass psychology, similar to Elias Canetti and Hannah Arendt. His essay on mass behaviour remained unfinished. From the 15th of August to the 15th of September 1939, Hermann Broch lived at the Albert Einstein House at 112 Mercer Street Princeton, New Jersey when the Einsteins were on vacation. (Late in the summer of 1939, Einstein rented a cottage on Nassau Point in Cutchogue, New York so that he could put his sailboat in Horshoe Cove.) From 1942 to 1948 Broch lived in an attic apartment in Eric and Lili Kahler's house at One Evelyn Place in Princeton, New Jersey. Broch died in 1951 in New Haven, Connecticut. He is buried in Killingworth, Connecticut, in the cemetery on Roast Meat Hill Road. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950.https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1355 Work One of his foremost works, The Death of Virgil (Der Tod des Vergil) was first published in 1945 simultaneously in its original German and in English translation. Having begun the text as a short radio lecture in 1937, Broch expanded and redeveloped the text over the next eight years of his life, which witnessed a short incarceration in an Austrian prison after the Austrian Anschluss, his flight to Scotland via England, and his eventual exile in the United States. This extensive, difficult novel interweaves reality, hallucination, poetry and prose, and reenacts the last 18 hours of the Roman poet Virgil's life in the port of Brundisium (Brindisi). Here, shocked by the balefulness (Unheil) of the society he glorifies in his Aeneid, the feverish Virgil resolves to burn his epic, but is thwarted by his close friend and emperor Augustus before he succumbs to his fatal ailment. The final chapter exhibits the final hallucinations of the poet, where Virgil voyages to a distant land at which he witnesses roughly the biblical creation story in reverse. The French composer Jean Barraqu√© composed a number of works inspired by The Death of Virgil. Erich Heller observed that if \\"The Death of Virgil is his masterpiece... it is a very problematical one, for it attempts to give literary shape to the author's growing aversion to literature. In the very year the novel appeared, Broch confessed to 'a deep revulsion' from literature as such ‚Äì 'the domain of vanity and mendacity'. Written with a paradoxical, lyrical exuberance, it is the imaginary record of the poet‚Äôs last day and his renunciation of poetry. He commands the manuscript of the Aeneid to be destroyed, not because it is incomplete or imperfect but because it is poetry and not 'knowledge'. He even says his Georgics are useless, inferior to any expert treatise on agriculture. His friend the Emperor Augustus undoes his design and his works are saved.\\" (Erich Heller, \\"Hitler in a very Small Town\\", The New York Times, January 25, 1987.) Other important works by Broch are The Sleepwalkers (Die Schlafwandler, 1932) and The Guiltless (Die Schuldlosen, 1950). The Sleepwalkers is a trilogy, where Broch takes \\"the degeneration of values\\" as his theme. The trilogy has been praised by Milan Kundera, whose writing has been greatly influenced by Broch. Broch demonstrates mastery of a wide range of styles, from the gentle parody of Theodor Fontane in the first volume of The Sleepwalkers through the essayistic segments of the third volume to the dithyrambic phantasmagoria of The Death of Virgil.

Popularized by both rock and jazz musicians such as Don Felder, Jimmy Page, Alex Lifeson, Steve Miller, Steve Clark, and John McLaughlin, it was named \\"the coolest guitar in rock\\" by the website Gigwise. History Gibson's first doubleneck guitars were produced from 1958 to 1961 with a hollow body and two 6-string necks, one being a short-scale neck tuned to a higher octave; from 1962 to 1967 it had a solid body. A model with a 4-string bass and a 6-string guitar neck was called the EBS-1250; it had a built-in fuzztone and was produced from 1962 to 1968 and again from 1977 to 1978. In 1963, the solid-body EDS-1275 was designed, resembling the SG model; this version of the doubleneck was available until 1968. The EDS-1275 is often referred to as the \\"SG doubleneck\\" due to its similar shape, although both necks of the 1275 have a shorter scale fret board than the SG and fixed tail pieces, where the SG has an adjustable one. The guitar was available in jet black, cherry, sunburst, and white. In 1974, Gibson started making the guitar again, in a number of additional colors, with production lasting until 1998. Since then, alpine white and heritage cherry versions were made by Gibson USA in Nashville, Tennessee, until 2003, in the Nashville Custom Shop from 2004 to 2005, and in the Memphis, Tennessee, Custom Shop beginning in 2006. Notable EDS-1275 users John McLaughlin in 1973. Steve Miller c. 1977 Jimmy Page with an EDS-1275. The EDS-1275, while never selling in great quantities, was used by a number of notable musicians. Chicago bluesman Earl Hooker is seen holding one on the cover of the 1969 albums Two Bugs and a Roach and The Moon is Rising, and Elvis Presley sports a cherry doubleneck in the 1966 movie Spinout. =Steve Clark= Steve Clark of Def Leppard signed an endorsement with Gibson in the mid-1980s and used two EDS 1275s on the Hysteria World Tour in 1987/88.steveclarkguitar.com =Don Felder= Former Eagles guitarist Don Felder, who predominantly used Gibson Les Pauls at the time, used a white EDS-1275 on live performances of \\"Hotel California\\". The 12-string neck would have a capo on the 7th fret, and would be used to play the intro and verses. Felder would switch to the 6-string neck for the choruses and the ending guitar duet with Joe Walsh. To honor the association of the EDS-1275 and this performance, Gibson Custom introduced the Don Felder ‚ÄúHotel California‚Äù EDS-1275 Limited Edition with 100 units aged and 50 units both aged and signed. A closeup of this guitar is used on the cover of the album American Rock 'n' Roll. =Alex Lifeson= Alex Lifeson of Rush first bought a cherry 1976 EDS-1275 in Nashville, at the end of the 2112 tour. It was modified with an aftermarket tune-o-matic bridge on the six-string, and a specially designed bridge on the twelve-string for intonation. In 1978, during the Hemispheres tour, the guitar was damaged when a speaker horn fell on it. Gibson later repaired it and repainted it Alpine White. Lifeson continued to use the guitar until the Signals Tour (1982‚Äì1983), when it was retired. It saw use again on the 'Counterparts' Tour in 1994, where it was used to play \\"Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres (Prelude)\\". In 1996, Lifeson gave the guitar to Gordie Johnson of Big Sugar. Johnson is seen playing it in the music video of the single \\"Diggin' a Hole\\". Lifeson used a newer version of the Alpine White on the R40 tour when the band played \\"Xanadu\\". =Ace Frehley= Ace Frehley used a three-pickup Les Paul Custom as well as an Ace Frehley Signature model and an EDS-1275. He also used a Les Paul Standard. =John McLaughlin= In the early 1970s, jazz-rock musician John McLaughlin played an EDS-1275 in his first years with the Mahavishnu Orchestra; the guitar, amplified through a 100-watt Marshall amplifier \\"in meltdown mode,\\" produced the signature McLaughlin sound hailed by Guitar Player as one of the \\"50 Greatest Tones of All Time.\\" =Steve Miller= Steve Miller played an EDS-1275 during the 1970s, alongside his familiar Fender Stratocasters. =Charlie Whitney= Charlie Whitney used an EDS-1275 as his primary stage instrument while in Family (1968-73). Family was noted for their unusual instrumental line up, which at times featured violin, reeds, vibraphone, and/or keyboards, and sometimes bassist John Wetton using a Gibson double-neck EBS (which pairs a 4-string bass with a 6-string guitar). Whitney continued using in while playing with Streetwalkers, along with Fender Telecasters and pedal steel guitars. =Jimmy Page= The EDS-1275 was mostly popularized by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, most notably during live performances of \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" The doubleneck obviated the need to switch guitars mid-song: at the beginning of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", he used the bottom 6-string neck for the intro and first verse, then switched to the top 12-string neck, then to the 6-string neck for the extended guitar solo, and back to the 12-string for the final chorus. By the time Page desired an EDS-1275, they were no longer in production so he ordered a custom-made cherry 6/12. Page's EDS-1275 has a slightly different body shape from that of the current model. Page's also has one-piece mahogany necks rather than the current three-piece maple, and has tailpieces positioned near the bottom of the body, reportedly increasing sustain, and Patent No. or T-Top humbucking pickups. Page's influence was such that after him other guitarists picked up the EDS-1275, including Alex Lifeson of Rush, who used it to play the song \\"Xanadu\\" live. Eddie Van Halen also has one in his collection. Jimmy Page signature model Gibson released a VOS (Vintage Original Spec) Jimmy Page Signature EDS-1275 model in 2007; a total of 250 were made. Page kept serial number one for himself. Serial numbers 2 through 26 of these were played and signed by Page; number 11 was donated for auction to benefit a charitable cause. =Slash= Slash plays a 1966 EDS-1275, with his own model being produced.https://www.gibson.com/Guitar/CUSWLK508/Slash-1966-EDS-1275-Doubleneck- Signed-Aged#https://www.nme.com/news/music/gibson-announce-insanely-badass- new-gibson-slash-doubleneck-guitar-2548119 Current model The guitar is currently offered only through the Gibson Custom Shop as a special order model. It features two volume and two tone control knobs, a three-way pickup- selector switch, and a three-way neck-selector switch. It has vintage tulip tuners, pearloid split parallelogram inlays, black pickguards and pickup rings, twenty frets per neck (bound with single-ply white binding), and 490 Alnico (R) and 498 Alnico (T) humbucking pickups. The Custom Shop also makes a Don Felder \\"Hotel California\\" signature model. New Gibson EDS-1275 and Epiphone G-1275 models feature longer 12-string headstocks than the original EDS-1275 and the \\"Hotel California\\" EDS-1275. Similar models =Epiphone= Epiphone (a Gibson subsidiary) makes a version of the classic doubleneck, marketing it as the G-1275. =Ibanez= Japanese guitar manufacturer Ibanez produced a model inspired by the Gibson, called the Double Axe, from 1974 to 1976. They were available as a 6/12, a 4/6, and a 6/6 configuration, in cherry and walnut finishes.

Personal life Hutchinson was born in Bentonville in northwestern Arkansas, the son of John Malcolm Hutchinson, Sr. (1907‚Äì91) and Coral Virginia (Mount) Hutchinson (1912‚Äì98). He was reared on the family farm in nearby Gravette. He graduated with a B.A. from Bob Jones University and received an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Arkansas (1990). He currently is a lobbyist and is a resident of Alexandria, Virginia. He is married to Randi Fredholm Hutchinson, an attorney in Washington, D.C. He was the first Republican to have been elected to the U.S. Senate in Arkansas since 1879. Early political career Hutchinson served in the Arkansas House of Representatives representing part of Fort Smith from 1985 to 1992. In 1992, he ran for the Republican nomination in after the popular 26-year incumbent John P. Hammerschmidt announced his retirement. He defeated a fellow Republican state lawmaker Richard L. Barclay of Rogers, for the Republican nomination. He faced Democrat John VanWinkle, an attorney from Fayetteville, in the general election, and won by only 7,500 votes‚Äîa margin of five percent. He owed his victory to a 10,000-vote margin in his native Benton County. It was the second-closest margin in the 3rd, one of the most Republican districts in the South, which Hammerschmidt had represented since January 1967. The only closer race was in 1974, when Bill Clinton came within 6,300 votes of ousting Hammerschmidt. Clinton narrowly carried the 3rd in his successful run for President, a presumed factor in the closeness of the 1992 congressional race. The district reverted to form in 1994, and Hutchinson was reelected with 63 percent of the vote. United States Senator =1996 election= Hutchinson ran for the Senate seat being vacated by popular Democrat David Pryor in 1996. Initially, the leading Republican candidate was Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee. When Democratic Governor Jim Guy Tucker resigned after being convicted of mail fraud, however, Huckabee assumed the governorship and dropped out of the Senate race; Hutchinson entered soon after and captured the Republican nomination. He would face state Attorney General Winston Bryant in the general election. Even though native son Bill Clinton carried the state by a 17-point margin over Bob Dole in the presidential race, Hutchinson defeated Bryant 53%-47% in the Senate election, largely by running up the votes in his congressional district. He became the first Republican Senator from Arkansas since Reconstruction, and the first to be popularly elected. =Tenure= Hutchinson opposes abortion, supports tax cuts, supports de-regulation of the economy, supports the death penalty and a Constitutional amendment banning flag burning, opposes same-sex marriage, and opposes expanding hate crimes legislation. In 1998, Hutchinson joined two other Republican Senators, Bob Smith of New Hampshire and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, in opposing President Bill Clinton's nomination of James Hormel, an openly gay man, as United States Ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel was later confirmed as ambassador in a recess appointment. He served on the Armed Services Committee, Aging Committee, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and Veterans' Affairs Committee. He was one of 16 co-sponsors of the Iraq Resolution (S.J.RES.46). Senator Hutchinson honored the Little Rock Nine in the award ceremony for their Congressional Medals of Honor. =2002 election= Hutchinson faced Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor, David Pryor's son, in his 2002 re- election campaign. During his term as U.S. Senator, Hutchinson had divorced his wife of almost three decades, Donna, a former Arkansas state representative, and married an aide in 2000. Hutchinson denied any impropriety, and Pryor refused to make the matter an issue in the campaign, but the well-publicized divorce substantially hurt his popularity. Pryor was also helped by the presence of his still popular father in a campaign commercial. Hutchinson lost to Pryor by eight points, making him the only Republican incumbent to be defeated that year. Jim Keet, the 2010 Arkansas Republican gubernatorial nominee, operated Hutchinson's Little Rock office for a time prior to 2002. Post-political career Hutchinson joined the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of Dickstein Shapiro in January 2003 as a senior adviser.Hutchinson's bio at Dickstein Shapiro LLP As of March 2016, Hutchinson serves as a senior director at the Washington, D.C. office of Greenberg Traurig. Family Hutchinson married his second wife, Randi Fredholm Hutchinson, a former senior member of staff, in 2000. He and his first wife, Donna Hutchinson, divorced in 1999 after 29 years. They have three sons: Jeremy Hutchinson, a former state representative; Timothy Chad Hutchinson, also a former state legislator; and Joshua Luke Hutchinson. Hutchinson's brother is current Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican former member of the U.S. House from Arkansas's 3rd congressional district, the former undersecretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial nominee in 2006, the same year that Donna Hutchinson was elected to the state House. Prior to his election to the Senate in 1996, Tim Hutchinson had also held the Third District U.S. House seat. Tim and Asa Hutchinson are the brothers-in-law of Arkansas State Senator Kim Hendren, who married Hutchinson's sister, Marylea, in 1958. Hendren was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in the 2010 election. On May 18, he lost the primary to current Senator John Boozman. Kim Hendren's son, Jim Hendren, was elected in 2012 to the District 2 seat from Benton County in the Arkansas State Senate.

It was founded in 1998 by seven musicians and manager Baillie Parker. It is now collectively owned among six musicians, co-founder Parker, and manager Shaun Koplow. The original musicians signed to Anticon were once referred to as the Anticon collective. History The label's roster of artists has been described as \\"the hip-hop equivalent of post-rock\\" and \\"avant-garde hip-hop\\". Releases feature material created by its members, affiliates, and extended musical family. Although Anticon cohered originally within alternative hip hop circles, Anticon's founders have become only tangentially related to hip hop, and the label has begun releasing music in the indie rock and electronica genres. Artists signed to Anticon are based in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The artists within the collective have been known to perform and release music in solo and group form. Artists on the label are known for frequent collaboration, both within and outside of their own collective. However, the Anticon collective has over time evolved into a group of separate artists who, despite sharing a similar progressive and often challenging indie quality, explore different styles of music including electronica and rock. Many of the artists on Anticon are signed to multiple labels, and some have their own small, independent labels through which they have self-released material. Anticon has also organized art exhibitions featuring visual art by several of the artists on the label. On February 9, 2010, co-founder Sole (Tim Holland) left Anticon exclaiming that it is time to try to push forward and find new opportunities. He leaves citing business and ideological differences while maintaining his love for the artists on Anticon. He said, \\"There are no ill feelings between myself and members of anticon. I will continue to work with many of the artists and will always love them as brothers and consider them allies.\\" He officially renounced his 1/8 of ownership and formal affiliations.

It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Ch√©seaux in 1745. Charles Messier catalogued it in 1764. It is located in the rich starfields of the Sagittarius area of the Milky Way.  Characteristics  Picture of M17 captured in narrowband by amateur astronomer Chuck Ayoub The Omega Nebula is between 5,000 and 6,000 light-years from Earth and it spans some 15 light-years in diameter. The cloud of interstellar matter of which this nebula is a part is roughly 40 light-years in diameter and has a mass of 30,000 solar masses. The total mass of the Omega Nebula is an estimated 800 solar masses. It is considered one of the brightest and most massive star- forming regions of our galaxy. Its local geometry is similar to the Orion Nebula except that it is viewed edge-on rather than face-on.. The open cluster NGC 6618 lies embedded in the nebulosity and causes the gases of the nebula to shine due to radiation from these hot, young stars; however, the actual number of stars in the nebula is much higher - up to 800, 100 of spectral type earlier than B9, and 9 of spectral type O, plus over a thousand stars in formation on its outer regions. It is also one of the youngest clusters known, with an age of just 1 million years. The luminous blue variable HD 168607, located in the south-east part of the Omega nebula, is generally assumed to be associated with it; its close neighbor, the blue hypergiant HD 168625, may be too. The Swan portion of M17, the Omega Nebula in the Sagittarius nebulosity is said to resemble a barber's pole.  Early research  The first attempt to accurately draw the nebula (as part of a series of sketches of nebulae) was made by John Herschel in 1833, and published in 1836. He described the nebula as such: A second, more detailed sketch was made during his visit to South Africa in 1837. The nebula was also studied by Johann von Lamont and separately by an undergraduate at Yale College, Mr Mason, starting from around 1836. When Herschel published his 1837 sketch in 1847, he wrote: Sketches were also made by William Lassell in 1862 using his four-foot telescope at Malta, and by M. Trouvelot from Cambridge, Massachusetts and Edward Singleton Holden in 1875 using the twenty-six inch Clark refractor at the United States Naval Observatory.

Shepherd's career as an athlete ended when she suffered life- threatening injuries when hit by a truck during a training bike ride. Before the accident, she had been in contention to win Australia's first ever medal at the Winter Olympics. Though she was told she would never walk again or have children, and doctors had significant doubts as to whether she would survive at all, she defied all of these, and her story later became the focus of national attention, as well as a popular telemovie. Early years Shepherd had been an athletics champion as a child, winning several national titles by the age of 10. Though she was talented at a number of sports, she settled on cross-country skiing. After achieving success on the World circuit, she was given the offer of training with the Canadian team in the leadup to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Accident In 1986, Shepherd was cycling through the Blue Mountains in New South Wales as part of her training regime, when everything changed. She was hit by a vehicle, suffering massive injuries. She suffered a broken neck and back, lost five litres of blood, suffered severe lacerations to her abdominal area. Her right leg was ripped open, her collarbone and five ribs were fractured, and she suffered serious internal injuries. Doctors at first thought she would not live, but she pulled through. She was then told that she would be bound to a wheelchair for the rest of her life, and would never bear children. Rehabilitation Over the next few years, Shepherd began to go through the slow rehabilitation process. She was determined to defy the predictions set by her doctors, and succeeded in doing so. Achievements While still remaining a partial paraplegic, she was ultimately able to walk again, and has three children. She gained her pilots license within a year of the accident, and went on to gain a commercial pilot's licence, then an instructor's license, eventually becoming a trained aerobatics flying instructor. She also became the first female director of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Shepherd has written six books about her experiences. The first, Never Tell Me Never was made into a successful telemovie, with Shepherd being played by Claudia Karvan. She also has a Bachelor's degree in Human Movement/Education. Shepherd was a torchbearer at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. More recently, Shepherd took up dressage in an attempt to represent Australia at the 2004 Summer Paralympics, despite suffering from chronic back pain. Shepherd is an ambassador for Spinal Cure Australia, and was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2001 for her service to the community, her inspiration and her work in raising awareness of spinal cord research. In 1998, Shepherd was also awarded the title of an Outstanding Young Persons of the World, one of ten young people recognised annually by the Junior Chamber International.

(Yoni Wolf) and Odd Nosdam (David Madson). The group's name came from a nonsensical knock-knock joke Drucker's sister told him when she was five years old. Style Generally Drucker and Wolf provide the group's vocals while Madson produces the music. Occasionally Madson's vocals can be heard, while Drucker and Wolf provide music, especially for the group's second album. Clouddead's sound is notoriously hard to define, and although it is undoubtedly grounded in \\"traditional\\" hip-hop, influences as varied as electronica, psychedelic music and indie rock can be heard. Because of this non-traditional take on hip-hop, more conservative elements of the rap community have characterized Clouddead as \\"smartarse surrealism,\\" with some elements of the community rejecting the notion that the group can be classed as hip hop at all, ignoring Sole's request to \\"just call it hip hop.\\" History Clouddead's first six 10-inch singles were compiled as a self- titled album, Clouddead, in 2001. Printed on the sleeve of the single \\"Dead Dogs Two\\" is \\"this is cLOUDDEAD number 9 of ten,\\" indicating that as of Ten (2004), Clouddead have finished making music as a group. In an interview around Ten's release, Drucker hinted that tensions between Madson and Wolf, as well as each member's heavy workload, had hastened the group's demise.

He is a powerful entity high in the demonic hierarchy. He's the master of the vengeance demons, a cabal which includes humans who are \\"elevated\\" to demonic status and endowed with mystical powers enabling them to invoke revenge at the behest of mortals who believe they have been wronged. D'Hoffryn rules over a hell dimension known as Arashmahaar. D'Hoffryn also appears in the comic books during the ninth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and acts as the main antagonist of the tenth season. Character History =Television= During the Dark Ages in Sweden a young woman named Aud comes to the attention of D'Hoffryn. Aud has recently used magic to turn her cheating boyfriend into a troll. (The character Aud is recognizable as Anya; her name is pronounced \\"odd\\"‚Äîthis is a play on the fact that people are always telling Anya she is odd.) Impressed by her imaginative revenge, D'Hoffryn offers her a position as a vengeance demon, and she becomes \\"Anyanka,\\" an avenger of scorned women. When Anyanka, under the guise of Anya, is robbed of her powers by Giles while attempting to exact vengeance on behalf of Cordelia, D'Hoffryn refuses to help her, leaving Anya stuck in a teenage body. In season four, D'Hoffryn attempts to convince Willow to become a vengeance demon after Oz leaves her and a spell she casts goes awry, resulting in a series of disasters for her friends which D'Hoffryn assumes she's done on purpose. She declines, but D'Hoffryn leaves his talisman (a tool to summon him) in case she changes her mind. In season six, D'Hoffryn is a guest at the failed wedding of Anya and Xander.Series 6 Episode \\"Hell's Bells', Region 2 DVD, Timecode 10:05 After Xander leaves Anya at the altar, D'Hoffryn reinstates her powers and the grief-stricken Anya once again becomes a vengeance demon. Anya's second stint as a vengeance demon in season seven proves short-lived, and after wreaking a terrible vengeance on several college males using a spider-like Grimslaw demon, Buffy confronts and fights her. Willow uses the talisman D'Hoffryn had given her to summon him, asking him to help put a stop to the fighting. D'Hoffryn asks Anya what she wants, and she says that she wants to reverse the vengeance she had done. D'Hoffryn grants her wish, telling her that it'll require the sacrifice of a vengeance demon's body and soul. Believing she is about to die, Anya is resigned to her fate only to watch helplessly as D'Hoffryn summons her friend Halfrek - another vengeance demon whose specialty is granting the wishes of unhappy children - and incinerates her instead. D'Hoffryn then leaves, disgusted with Anya. Episodes later, D'Hoffryn sends at least two demons to kill Anya, but they are both thwarted. =Literature= D'Hoffryn returns in the Buffy Season Nine as a member of Illyria's magic council bent on protecting whatever remains of magic following the destruction of the Seed of Wonder last season. D'Hoffryn returns in Season Ten as the season's Big Bad. He starts off working alongside the Scoobies to help facilitate the new rules of magic, but ends up double-crossing the other members of the magic council in favour of keeping the Slayer Handbook for himself to mould reality to his will. He also resurrects a duplicate of Anya, initially in the form of a ghost visible only to Xander, to convince her of Xander's deceit and ensure her loyalty to him. The Slayer Handbook's new laws of magic empower D'Hoffryn to annihilate the demon lords opposing Buffy, removing his rivals for conquest of the world, as well as the rest of the magic council. He is assisted by Jonathan Levinson, who was previously resurrected by Andrew Wells and the demon Sculptor but only temporarily due to Andrew's betrayal of the Sculptor, who was killed by Buffy. To ensure Jonathan's survival, D'Hoffryn turns him into a vengeance demon, before leading an attack on the Scooby Gang. However Anya betrays D'Hoffryn to save Xander, and is then killed by D'Hoffryn, at which point Jonathan and the other vengeance demons abandon him to be slain by Buffy.

He moved into the film industry in the late 1970s, initially getting in the door by working for nothing, then working as a boom operator for Television New Zealand, and on the feature films: Skin Deep, Goodbye Pork Pie, and Bad Blood. In the early 1980s Pork Pie director Geoff Murphy promoted Tamahori to become an assistant director on Utu, and he subsequently worked as first assistant director on The Silent One, Murphy's The Quiet Earth, Came a Hot Friday and Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence.

Feature films Tamahori had directed a number of shorter dramas for television before he made his feature film debut in 1994 with Once Were Warriors, a gritty depiction of a violent MƒÅori family. The film had had problems finding funding, but it went on to break box office records in New Zealand. Overseas it sold to many countries and won rave reviews from Time magazine, Village Voice, and The Melbourne Age, with Time and The Age naming it one of the ten best films of the year. Tamahori moved to Hollywood and directed the period thriller Mulholland Falls (1996), although this was not received well critically or commercially.

The manga was originally serialized in Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump and later moved to Ultra Jump at the magazines start. It was later adapted into a 26-episode anime television series which ran from October 1998 to March 1999 on TV Tokyo. In North America, the anime is licensed by ADV Films and the manga by Viz Media. Plot Steam City is a place where the only fuel source is coal, and the only means to produce energy is the steam engine. As the only source of energy, the steam engine has been the focus of technological advancement to the point where it can be substituted for any other form of power in modern technology. These same advancements also have given rise to Megamatons, large steam-powered robots. With the air of Steam City thick with fog and white smoke, thieves and criminals flourish with Megamatons as a common tool in their nefarious plans. It is here that the reader and/or viewer finds Narutaki, a young detective fighting for the peace of the city. Characters ; : :Son of the greatest detective in Steam City, Narutaki takes up the mantle after his parents' death. He is considered by some a child genius, but an annoyance by others. He is compassionate, and sometimes naive in his attitude towards both his citizen charges and the villains he pursues. Narutaki loves Steam City and vows to protect it from danger. His investigation style is similar to Sherlock Holmes. He uses a multi-purpose gun and various tools to aid his investigations. Despite his young age, he drinks tea and has an eye for pretty ladies. He also has a passion for toy models, and is described as \\"precocious\\" by Ling Ling. ; : :Ling Ling is the youngest daughter of Dr. Hsu and the writer Feifer. A young nurse who owns the Megamaton, Goriki. :She and Goriki become assistants of Narutaki after being tricked into helping Night Phantom. Much of her past is a mystery. She helps Narutaki in his investigations and looks after his health. Ling Ling is sensitive and caring to others but she can rise to the occasion. Her overly sentimental nature does put her in danger when she throws herself into things. She volunteers at the local hospitals since they are often understaffed. It is hinted in the manga that she may have feelings for Narutaki. ; : :The Narutaki family butler and mechanic, he is the primary caretaker of Narutaki. Kawakubo also repairs Goriki. Kawakubo was the butler for Narutaki's father and is familiar with the older cases. He assists Narutaki in his lab work and research. He also manages Narutaki's affairs and looks after the house and its occupants. ; : :The last Megamaton built by Dr. Hsu, Goriki means \\"great strength\\". According to the last wishes of the doctor, Dr. Hsu's brain is implanted inside Goriki's body. Unlike most Megamatons, Goriki does not need to be remote controlled. He provides the brunt of Narutaki Detective Agency's strength. He is capable of understanding speech and appears to respond to Ling Ling's emotions. Goriki is always ready to battle despite the reluctance of Ling Ling. ; : :His true identity is Dr. Hart, a rival scientist of Dr. Hsu. He considers Dr. Hsu his enemy, and wishes to prove himself as the best. The pair disagreed on how Megamaton technology should be used. He often attacks Steam City with advanced Megamatons. He aims to rule the world with the aid of his Megamatons. ; : :A detective with the Steam City Police Department, he is a good detective but can be a little over the top. He resents Narutaki's involvement in the cases. He is also very open about his love for Ling Ling, which is not returned. ; : :Chief Inspector Yagami is Narutaki‚Äôs most trusted friend in the police force. He is not afraid of asking help from Narutaki, he also provides Narutaki with information pertaining to cases. He likes to think things through when solving a case. ; : :\\"Phantom Knight\\" in the manga. A mysterious villain who has a past and a grudge with Narutaki and Narutaki's father. His father, the previous Phantom Knight, killed Narutaki's parents. He hates Steam City and vows to destroy it so he can avenge his father. Unlike most villains, he often creates elaborate plans to trick and kill Narutaki. His design and personality draw parallels to Batman. ; : :A female thief who loves precious gems and jewellery. She often uses trickery and illusion to steal her prizes. She is very adept at disguising herself, which is a useful skill used for cat burglary. She also dislikes being called 'old'. ;Machine Baron : :A mechanic otaku, he steals items that are mechanical in nature. He is obsessed with Goriki and comes across more as comic relief or as a sweet loser rather than a true villain. He wears a metal mask with only his left eye exposed and has an army of mechanical henchmen who don‚Äôt always follow orders. ; : :A criminal mastermind whose intelligence is equal to Narutaki, he often sets up cat-and- mouse games against the young detective and the Steam City police. Le Bled steals priceless and rare items in the belief that he is the only one to appreciate them. It is later revealed that he suffers from an incurable terminal illness and steals to live life to the fullest. Although he is a thief, he has a sense of honor. Le Bled bears a scar from a confrontation with Narutaki. He resides in a castle far away from Steam City and seems to be quite rich. ; : :Ling Ling's older sister, she is the partner and lover of Le Bled. Unlike Ling Ling, she seems to have a disdain for helping the sick. She wears black as a sign of mourning for the patients that she has killed to end their suffering. Lang Lang looks after Le Bled and helps in his thefts. She worries that Le Bled is pushing himself too far and cares for him to the best of her ability. She inherited the design for Dr. Hsu‚Äôs last Megamaton Hiroh, which she had built for Le Bled. =Minor Characters= ;Pasta and Doria :Crimson Scorpion's henchmen, they are more cautious than their boss but follow her orders without question. ;Anna Highend :A police officer who transferred from Electrical City so she could meet Narutaki. She is tall and good looking. ;Dr. Mayerd :A scientist in energy technology, he repairs and maintains Goriki at his factory. ;Soichiro Narutaki :Narutaki's father, and the previous owner of Narutaki Detective Agency.

He and his wife lost their lives during an encounter with the original Night Phantom. ;Wolf and Carlos :Two criminals from Techland that sometimes appear in Steam City to steal blueprints of new technologies to advance Techland's own power.

It was also known as Dait≈çtei during Japanese rule, and Tataocheng or Dadaocheng (Mandarin) during the Kuomintang era. Twatutia was an important trading port in the 19th century, and is still a major historical tourist attraction and shopping area. The district is known for the local Taiwanese cuisine, the Chien-Cheng Circle, and also being the center of the February 28 Incident. History When the export of tea became important in northern Taiwan in the mid-19th century, many businessmen appeared at Twatutia. The first shop opened in 1851, belonging to Lin Lan-tian (ÊûóËóçÁî∞), a native of Keelung. Lin opened three shops that he later called Lim Ek-sun (ÊûóÁõäÈ†Ü). Foreigners entered the trade in 1867 and five British firms had been established at Twatutia by 1872. In 1853, many people moved into the area from Bangka following a serious conflict. The first rail station in Taipeh (modern-day Taipei) was completed in Twatutia in October 1891, when the railway to Keelung was opened for service. The branch line from Taipeh to Tamsui was completed in June 1901, and (Â§ßÁ®ªÂüïËªäÁ´ô) opened as part of the then TRA Tamsui Line. However, it was closed to passenger service in 1916 and continued to operate as a freight-only station until its eventual closure in 1937. In the early 20th century, Daitotei was considered a part of the Taihoku (Taipei) area outside of the city proper, and was where European settlers lived. It stretched northward along the Tamsui River, which flows down to the port, a distance of about . Daitotei was the second most populous city in Taiwan (second to Tainan and followed by Banka) with a population of thirty to forty thousand. In 1920, it became part of the newly incorporated Taihoku City under Taihoku Prefecture. Daitotei was the location for one of the first movie theaters built for the native Taiwanese audience during Japanese occupation. The interior structure of Eraku-za imitated the Imperial Theater in Tokyo and included a caf√©, a gymnasium and dressing rooms. Also, during the Japanese occupation it was used as one of the sites for The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule. Dihua Street The most famous street in Dadaocheng was named Dihua Street after World War II and is the oldest street in Taipei. There are many stores selling dried goods and snacks, especially before the Lunar New Year. Taipei Xia-Hai City God Temple (Â§ßÁ®ªÂüïÈúûÊµ∑ÂüéÈöçÂªü) is also on Dihua Street. There is a festival to celebrate the birthday of Xiahai Cheng Huang (City God) on the 13th day of the 5th lunar month every year.

The label releases soundtrack albums from Disney's motion pictures, television series, theme parks, and traditional studio albums produced by its roster of pop, teen pop, and country artists. The label was founded in 1956 as Disneyland Records. Before that time, Disney recordings were licensed to a variety of other labels such as RCA, Decca, Capitol, ABC-Paramount, and United Artists. It was Walt Disney‚Äôs brother Roy O. Disney who suggested that Walt Disney Productions (now The Walt Disney Company) should form their own record label. Roy enlisted longtime staffer Jimmy Johnson to head this new division. It adopted its current name in 1989.  History  Disneyland Records was conceived by Roy O. Disney in 1954 for material from Davy Crockett miniseries on the Disneyland anthology television series. The \\"Ballad of Davy Crockett\\", along with three audio only episodes, were to be the initial material for the record company, but his brother company founder Walt Disney decided that they could not ramp up quickly enough. Instead the label was used for a licensed Columbia Records release of the Ballad to TV and radio stations in December 1954. With the record's success, they moved forward with the formation of the record company. = Disneyland Records = Disneyland Records logo The company was founded as Disneyland Records in 1956, serving as the recorded unit of Walt Disney Productions. Both Walt and Roy asked their longtime worker Jimmy Johnson to head the division. The Disneyland company issued its first (LP) album, A Child's Garden of Verses. Jimmy Johnson brought in musician Tutti Camarata to head the Artists and repertoire of this new enterprise. In the first year, seven Disney animated movie soundtracks were issued by the company. Disneyland Records issued Parker's \\"Wringle Wrangle\\" single from the Westward Ho the Wagons! film with in a year of starting operations; the single became a hit. This led the company to start recording music from outside the films. However, what ever was released by the company the industry categorized as children. Pricing was directed towards an adult audience, which was more than standard children fare. The only outside success was Camarata‚Äôs album \\"Tutti's Trumpets\\". Thus in 1959, the Disneyland label became the soundtrack and children's label and Buena Vista label for the occasional pop song record. Camarata established the label's initial forays into long-form musical albums, which included jazz interpretations of Disney standards from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Bambi, and Cinderella, as well as original musical concept albums, and he expanded the format of soundtracks by including selections from the score as well as the songs. Tutti's connections within the music industry also brought to the label the likes of Mary Martin, Louis Armstrong, Louis Prima, Jerry Colonna, and Phil Harris. It was also Tutti's idea that the popular Mouseketeer, Annette Funicello, become the label's first artist in residence. In 1959, the Buena Vista Records label was formed for Funicello's select recordings and for the release of soundtrack albums and other contemporary music. While looking for the right material for Annette, Tutti and his team discovered the songwriting duo of Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman after hearing one of their songs on the radio. The two were brought to the Disney studio in Burbank where they eventually became the first staff songwriters for the company. They not only penned a good deal of Annette's songs, but were also responsible for most of the iconic Disney songs of the 1960s and beyond ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt's a Small World‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Tiki Tiki Tiki Room‚Äù for the theme parks, as well as the songs from Mary Poppins, Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, The Jungle Book, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. In 1960, Camarata left the company. The dual label company started its read-along series in 1965. By 1971, Disneyland Records was also called Disneyland/Vista Records. Also, A Child's Garden of Verses was still in their line. Disneyland/Vista worked with Rankin/Bass to release six recording tied to The Hobbit 1977 animated film as Rankin/Bass had Disneyland/Vista do soundtrack for two of their earlier holiday specials, Frosty's Winter Wonderland and ‚ÄôTwas the Night Before Christmas.Culhan, John. Will the Video Version of Tolkien Be Hobbit Forming? The New York Times, Nov 27, 1977. The company was so successful with its Mickey Mouse Disco album that Disneyland looked to expand again into pop music by October 1980. Its success also lead to the issuance of animated theatrical shorts based on songs from the album. Two such original productions were \\"That Waddlin' Crazy Guy\\" and \\"Partners\\". = Walt Disney Records = In 1989, Disneyland Records was renamed Walt Disney Records. About 1990, Walt Disney Records signed several youth targeted acts like Parachute Express and Norman Foote. Disney let these act go after several years as their mandate was changed to support the animated features, produce book and tape packages and compilations to take advantage of the catalog. In May 2000, Walt Disney Records signed the label's first teen singer, Myra with her first single with the label, \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\", was released May 23, 2000 as a part of La Vida Mickey album. On June 24, 2014, Walt Disney Records started releasing The Legacy Collection. The series includes original soundtracks, as well as unreleased music, and composer and producer liner notes. The collection includes 14 albums ranging between various anniversaries of various Disney films and Disneyland. With Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012, it became the official label for all Star Wars- related soundtracks, beginning with The Force Awakens soundtrack in 2015. In January 2017, Disney acquired the distribution rights to the entire Star Wars music catalog from Sony Classical; the soundtrack albums from the first six films were then released by Walt Disney Records in digital formats the same day. Disney digitally remastered and reissued the original Star Wars soundtrack albums in physical formats on May 4, 2018.

She was named in honor of Stephen Decatur. Construction Decatur was launched on 26 September 1900 by William R. Trigg Company, Richmond, Virginia; sponsored by Miss M. D. Mayo, great-grandniece of Commodore Decatur; and commissioned on 19 May 1902, Lieutenant Lloyd Horwitz Chandler in command. Pre-World War I Decatur was designated lead vessel of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla with which she conducted drills and maneuvers along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Caribbean until December 1903, when the flotilla departed Norfolk for the Asiatic Station, sailing by way of the Suez Canal. Arriving at Cavite, Philippines, on 14 April 1904, Decatur exercised along the China coast and cruised in Philippine waters until placed in reserve at Cavite on 5 December 1905. For the next three years, she made infrequent cruises, including one to the southern Philippines in January‚ÄìFebruary 1908 and Saigon in May 1908. Decatur ran aground on a sand bar in the Philippines on 7 July 1908 while under the command of Ensign Chester W. Nimitz. The ship was pulled free the next day, and Nimitz was court-martialed, found guilty of neglect of duty, and issued a letter of reprimand. Placed out of commission on 18 February 1909, Decatur was placed in commission in reserve on 22 April 1910 and in full commission on 22 December. She resumed operations with the Torpedo Flotilla, cruising in the southern Philippines and between ports of China and Japan until on 1 August 1917, when she departed for the Mediterranean.

Early life Robinson was born in the capital city of Little Rock and graduated from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. He served in the United States Navy from 1959 to 1963. Law enforcement career Robinson had a career in law enforcement, in which he reached the position of sheriff of Pulaski County. He previously served as a North Little Rock city patrolman, Arkansas state trooper, director of campus police at the University of Arkansas, and the police chief in Jacksonville, Arkansas. In 1979, he was appointed by Governor Bill Clinton as director of the short-lived Department of Public Safety, which was abolished in 1981 by Clinton's successor, Republican Frank D. White. Robinson was elected sheriff of Pulaski County in 1980, having defeated the incumbent Ken Best in the Democratic primary. He was re-elected in 1982. Robinson's tenure was one of non-stop controversies. In early 1981, in order to relieve jail overcrowding he ordered a group of state prisoners being held at the Pulaski County Jail to be taken to the state prison at Pine Bluff. Robinson left the prisoners chained to the (front gate of the prison) when the warden refused to accept them. The 1982 murder of Little Rock socialite Alice McArthur resulted in Robinson conducting a sensational investigation of her husband, attorney William McArthur. Robinson spent time in jail in 1983 on a federal contempt of court citation for having refused to allow the federally appointed jail master, Kenneth Basinger, to enter the jail. In response, the federal judge overseeing the case, George Howard, Jr., an African-American, was described publicly by Robinson as \\"a token judge.\\" When his request for more money for his office was denied, he arrested County Judge Bill Beaumont and Comptroller Jo Adcock on charges of obstructing governmental operations. He released Beaumont and Adcock only when threatened with another contempt of court citation. A well-publicized raid on a \\"toga party\\" led by Central Arkansas Socials led to multiple lawsuits and the labeling of Robinson and his deputies as the \\"Keyhole Kops\\". Governor Frank White referred to Robinson as \\"Captain Hotdog\\". Robinson's profanity-laced tirades at press conferences were common. In response to the high armed robbery rate in the county, Robinson initiated a program of placing hidden deputies in random convenience stores armed with shotguns, the result was a 96 percent drop in armed robberies during his tenure. Political career Robinson was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1984 as a Democrat. He led a five-man field in the Democratic primary that included Secretary of State Paul Riviere, State Senator Stanley Russ of Conway, investment banker and former Senate aide Thedford Collins, and conservative former U.S. Representative Dale Alford. He bested Riviere in the runoff, and defeated Judy Petty, a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a former aide to the late Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, and Independent Jim Taylor, a liberal Democrat horrified by the more conservative Robinson. Petty ran as a Ronald W. Reagan Republican but lost to Robinson even though Reagan won her district. In the three-way race, Robinson polled 46 percent of the vote to Petty's 42 percent, while the underfinanced Taylor took 12 percent. Robinson financed his race on almost $900,000 in unsecured bank loans, making his the most expensive congressional race in state history up to that time. While in Congress, Robinson was often at odds with the Democratic leadership of Tip O'Neill and Jim Wright, and identified closely with the \\"Boll Weevil\\" faction. On July 28, 1989, Robinson left the Democratic Party and joined the GOP, claiming that the Democratic Party had become too liberal. He ran for governor of Arkansas in 1990 but lost in the primary election to businessman Sheffield Nelson, also a former Democrat. Nelson was in turn defeated by Bill Clinton. Robinson's House seat was assumed in 1991 by the Democrat Ray Thornton, a former congressman and a former Arkansas Attorney General. Thornton defeated the Republican candidate, Jim Keet, then a freshman state representative and restaurateur from Little Rock. In 2010, Keet was the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial nominee against Mike Beebe. In 1992, during the House banking scandal, Robinson, then an ex-representative, was found to have bounced 996 checks from the U.S. House bank, some of which were more than 16 months overdue. Robinson ran again for the U.S. House in 2002 after a twelve-year absence in a district in the northeastern part of the state, but lost to the Democratic incumbent, Marion Berry. Out of Congress, Robinson farmed cotton, milo, and soybeans on some two thousand acres near Brinkley in Monroe County in eastern Arkansas. In 2010, after years of financial difficulties, a group of creditors obtained a forced bankruptcy against Ag-Pro Farms II, and Robinson lost ownership of the farm to satisfy about $6.5 million in debts. During the administration of Republican Governor Mike Huckabee, Robinson sat on the Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and later served almost five years as chairman of the Pardon and Parole Board. Today, Robinson is the principal in a political consulting and lobbying firm called The Robinson Group, LLC. Along with local and state candidates, the firm has also had foreign clients as well, most notably Yasser Arafat. His partners are attorney Larry Wallace, a former law partner of one-time Robinson rival Sheffield Nelson, and lobbyist Rickey Hicks. He and his family have also owned a liquor store in Brinkley for several years.

Early years Flores (birth name: Pedro Juan Flores C√≥rdova) was one of twelve children born into a poor family in the town of Naguabo, Puerto Rico. Flores' father died when he was only nine years old so he had to work from a young age. When he was sixteen years old, he took a special course at the University of Puerto Rico (Universidad de Puerto Rico) and received his teachers certificate. Flores taught for five years and worked for one year at a sugar mill in the island of Vieques. In 1918, he served in a clerical position in the United States Army.

Even though Flores and Hern√°ndez became very good friends, they also became competitors as composers. When Flores wrote \\"Sin Bandera\\", Hern√°ndez rushed and wrote Preciosa. In 1930, Flores formed his own trio which he named \\"Tr√≠o Gal√≥n\\", and whose music and songs had a faster beat than the \\"Tr√≠o Borinquen\\". Flores had problems with the music publishing company and he abandoned the trio. He moved to Mexico and then lived in Cuba for a short period of time.

He was the initial designated head of design at General Motors, later becoming vice president, the first top executive ever appointed in design of a major corporation in American history. He was an industrial designer and a pioneer of modern transportation design. A coachbuilder by trade, Earl pioneered the use of freeform sketching and hand sculpted clay models as automotive design techniques. He subsequently introduced the \\"concept car\\" as both a tool for the design process and a clever marketing device. Earl's Buick Y-Job was the first concept car. He started \\"Project Opel\\", which eventually became the Chevrolet Corvette, and he authorized the introduction of the tailfin to automotive styling. During World War II, he was an active contributor to the Allies' research and development program in advancing the effectiveness of camouflage. Early life Harley Earl was born in Hollywood, California. His father, J. W. Earl, began work as a coachbuilder in 1889. The senior Earl eventually changed his practice from horse-drawn vehicles to custom bodies and customized parts and accessories for automobiles, founding Earl Automobile Works in 1908.Harley Earl 1893~1969 Earl began studies at Stanford University, but left prematurely to work with, and learn from, his father at Earl Automotive Works. By this time, the shop was building custom bodies for Hollywood movie stars, including Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle and Tom Mix. General Motors phaeton Earl Automotive Works was bought by Cadillac dealer Don Lee, who kept Harley Earl as director of its custom body shop. Lawrence P. Fisher, general manager of the Cadillac division, was visiting Cadillac dealers and distributors around the country, including Lee. Fisher met Earl at Lee's dealership and observed him at work. Fisher, whose automotive career began with coachbuilder Fisher Body, was impressed with Earl's designs and methods, including the use of modeling clay to develop the forms of his designs.. Fisher commissioned Earl to design the 1927 LaSalle for Cadillac's companion marque. The success of the LaSalle convinced General Motors president Alfred P. Sloan to create the Art and Color Section of General Motors, and to name Earl as its first director. Prior to the establishment of the Art and Color Section, American automobile manufacturers did not assign any great importance to the appearance of automobile bodies. Volume manufacturers built bodies designed by engineers, guided only by functionality and cost. Many luxury-car manufacturers, including GM, did not make bodies at all, opting instead to ship chassis assemblies to a coachbuilder of the buyer's choice. The executives at General Motors at the time, including engineers, division heads, and sales executives, viewed Earl's conceptual ideas as flamboyant and unfounded. Earl struggled to legitimize his design approach against the tradition- and production-oriented executives. As head of the newly formed Art and Color Section in 1927, he was initially referred to as one of the \\"pretty picture boys\\", and his design studio as being the \\"Beauty Parlor\\".Cambridge, MIT Press (1995), 200-212 Design History: An Anthology. In 1937, the Art and Color Section was renamed the Styling Section.Just Who Was Harley Earl? Sloan eventually promoted Earl to vice president, making him, to Sloan's knowledge, the first styling person to be a VP at a large corporation. After the early 1930s, Earl seldom drew sketches or did design work himself, usually functioning as an overlord who supervised GM stylists, although he would retain ultimate authority over the styling department until his retirement. Harley Earl and Sloan implemented \\"Dynamic Obsolescence\\" (essentially synonymous with planned obsolescence) and the \\"Annual Model Change\\", tying model identity to a specific year, to further position design as a driver for the company's product success. At the same time, Earl was careful to not depart too radically from the previous year's styling to maintain a semblance of continuity. This practice also ensured that used GM cars had the highest resale values of any American automotive make. Earl also avoided extreme or radical styling choices that would become dated quickly and alienate conservative-minded customers.Richard A. Wright, 1996.First 100 Years of the Auto Industry in the U.S.. These ideas are largely taken for granted today, but were unusual at the time. =Buick Y-Job= Harley Earl and the Buick Y-Job 1951 General Motors Le Sabre In 1939, the Styling Division, under Earl's instruction, styled and built the Buick Y-Job, the motor industry's first concept car. While many one-off custom automobiles had been made before, the Y-job was the first car built by a mass manufacturer for the sole purpose of determining the public's reaction to new design ideas. After being shown to the public, the Y-job became Earl's daily driver. It was succeeded by the 1951 General Motors Le Sabre concept car. =Camouflage research= In 1942, during World War II, Earl established a camouflage research and training division at General Motors, one consequence of which was a 22-page document called Camouflage Manual for General Motors Camouflage.Lauve, Henry de S. (1942), Camouflage Manual for General Motors Camouflage School. Detroit MI: General Motors. A decade before, two former World War I camouflage artists, Harold Ledyard Towle (a U.S. Army camoufleur) and McClelland Barclay (who created the Fisher Body ads, and contributed to U.S. Navy camouflage during both World Wars) had worked as designers at General Motors. Among Earl's apprentices was English designer David Jones, who worked at its British division at Vauxhall Motors and served in the camouflage section of the Royal Engineers during World War II.Entries on \\"McClelland Barclay,\\" \\"Harley Earl,\\" \\"David Jones\\" and \\"Ledyard Towle\\" in Behrens, Roy R. (2009), Camoupedia: A Compendium of Research on Art, Architecture and Camouflage. Dysart IA: Bobolink Books. . =Tailfins= 1959 Cadillac tailfin Harley Earl authorized the Frank Hershey design for the 1948 Cadillac, which incorporated the first automotive tailfin. Many of the new 1948-49 cars such as Hudson, Nash, and Lincoln adopted fastback or \\"bathtub\\" styling. Although Earl considered this for Cadillac, he ultimately decided against it and went for a more sweeping aircraft-inspired look. This decision would prove a wise one as bathtub styling, a concept rooted in late 1930s-early 1940s design trends, quickly became dated. The styling of the 1948 Cadillac would prove far more predictive of 1950s trends and secured GM's place at the cutting edge of automotive design. Inspiration for the fins came from the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, but it extended beyond the war, during the age when space rockets captured the popular imagination in the 1950s and 1960s. The style caught on throughout Detroit and eventually led to competition between Harley Earl and his counterpart at Chrysler, Virgil Exner, over the size and complexity of tailfins, culminating with those on the 1959 Cadillac models. =Chevrolet Corvette= Chevrolet Corvette Influenced by the English and European sports cars being raced on road racing circuits after World War II, Earl decided that General Motors needed to make a sports car. Design work on \\"Project Opel\\" began as a secret project. He first offered the project to Chevrolet general manager Ed Cole. Cole accepted the project without hesitation, and the car was offered to the public in 1953 as the Chevrolet Corvette. =Succession= Earl retired in 1958 upon reaching the then-mandatory retirement age of 65. His final project was overseeing the design of 1960‚Äì62 models. He was succeeded as vice-president with responsibility for the Design and Styling Department by Bill Mitchell, under whose leadership GM design became less ornamental. Before Earl retired, General Motors became the largest corporation in the world, and design was acknowledged as the leading sales factor within the automotive industry. Death and legacy Harley Earl suffered a stroke and died in West Palm Beach, Florida, on April 10, 1969. He was 75 years old. He is remembered as the first styling chief in the United States automobile industry, the originator of clay modeling of automotive designs, the wraparound windshield, the hardtop sedan, factory two-tone paint, and tailfins. He said in 1954, \\"My primary purpose for twenty-eight years has been to lengthen and lower the American automobile, at times in reality and always at least in appearance.\\" The extremely low and long American cars of the 1960s and 1970s show the extent to which Earl influenced an entire industry and culture. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1986. One of his concept car designs, the turbine-powered Firebird I, is reproduced in miniature on the Harley J. Earl Trophy, which goes to the winner of the season-opening Daytona 500 NASCAR race. Harley Earl was used in a brief advertising campaign for Buick, particularly during its reconstruction period between 2001 and 2002. Actor John Diehl, portraying Earl (or his ghost) was used to symbolize the importance of design in Buick's cars, or as the advertisements put it, the \\"Spirit of American Style\\". A fedora was often used as an Earl icon in these advertisements despite photos of Earl wearing a hat being quite uncommon. In a December 1999 special section in the Detroit Free Press, Earl was ranked the third most significant Michigan artist of the 20th century, behind Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder.Detroit Free Press staff. \\"Michigan's 100 Greatest Artists & Entertainers of the 20th Century\\", Detroit Free Press, Detroit, Michigan, 12 December 1999.

Babinski received his medical degree from the University of Paris in 1884. He came early to Professor Charcot at Paris' Salp√™tri√®re Hospital and became his favorite student.

Charcot's 1893 death left Babinski without support, and he subsequently never participated in qualifying academic competitions. Free of teaching duties, while working at the H√¥pital de la Piti√© he was left with ample time to devote himself to clinical neurology. He was a masterful clinician, minimally dependent on neuropathological examinations and laboratory tests. Babinski also took an interest in the pathogenesis of hysteria and was the first to present acceptable differential-diagnostic criteria for separating hysteria from organic diseases, and coined the concept of pithiatism. In 1896, at a meeting of the Soci√©t√© de Biologie, Babi≈Ñski, in a 26-line presentation, delivered the first report on the \\"phenom√®ne des orteils\\", i.e., that while the normal reflex of the sole of the foot is a plantar reflex of the toes, an injury to the pyramidal tract will show an isolated dorsal flexion of the great toe‚Äî\\"Babinski's sign.\\" During World War I, Babinski had charge of many traumatic neurology cases at the Piti√© Hospitals. He was professor of neurology at the University of Paris. Babinski wrote over 200 papers on nervous disorders. With Jules Froment he published Hysteropithiatisme en Neurologie de Guerre (1917), which was translated into English in 1918 by Sir H. Rolleston. Babi≈Ñski published some of his works in Polish. Babinski lived with his younger brother, Henri Babinski, a distinguished engineer and famous cook who, as \\"Ali Baba,\\" published a classic cookbook. With Pierre Palau, Babinski, under the pseudonym \\"Olaf,\\" wrote a disturbing play, Les d√©traqu√©es, which premiered at the Deux-Masques theater in 1921.

Born in Chongqing, Li is most well known for being the youngest pianist, at the age of 18, to win the International Fr√©d√©ric Chopin Piano Competition, in 2000, and for judging it in 2015. Childhood His father, Li Chuan, and his mother, Zhang Xiaolu, were both workers for the Sichuan Chongqing Steel and Iron Company. Although coming from a family of non-musicians, Li took to music early. When he was three years old, his parents bought him an accordion after he became so entranced by an accordion player in a shopping mall that he refused to leave. He mastered the instrument by the age of four, studying with Tan Jianmin, a music professor in China. Only one year later, he won the top prize at the Chongqing Children's Accordion Competition. Li began studying piano at the age of seven. Two years later, his teacher introduced him to Dan Zhaoyi, one of China's most renowned piano teachers, with whom he would study for nine years. Li's ambition was to become a professional pianist. In 1994, he entered the Shenzhen Arts School, Shenzhen, China. He later studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover in Hanover, Germany. Awards Li has received top awards at various competitions. He won the Children's Piano Competition in Beijing in 1994. In 1995, he was awarded first place at the Stravinsky International Youth Competition. In 1996, he won the Third Class Award in the 10th Hong Kong - Asia Piano Open Competition, the most competitive competition in Asia for international pianists. In 1998, he won the 1998 Missouri Southern International Piano Competition (Junior Division). The next year, he took Third Prize at the International Franz Liszt Piano Competition of Utrecht, as well as being a major winner in the China International Piano Competition. He also won first place at the Gina Bachauer Young Artists International Piano Competition. In October 2000, at the urging of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, Li participated in the 14th International Fr√©d√©ric Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw.

She was the first of many female regents in the Netherlands. A central political figure of the early 16th century, Margaret was one of the greatest government administrators, political negotiators, and patrons of her time. She helped Emperor Charles V overcome his uncertain steps at the beginning of his reign and became an invaluable asset to his rule until her death. Childhood and Life in France Margaret was born on 10 January 1480 and named after her stepgrandmother, Margaret of York. She was the second child and only daughter of Maximilian of Austria (future Holy Roman Emperor) and Mary of Burgundy, co-sovereigns of the Low Countries. In 1482, her mother died and her three-year old brother Philip the Handsome succeeded her as sovereign of the Low Countries, with her father as his regent. The same year her mother died, King Louis XI of France signed the Treaty of Arras, whereby her father promised to give her hand in marriage to Louis's son, Dauphin Charles. The engagement took place in 1483. With Franche- Comt√© and Artois as her dowry, Margaret was transferred to the guardianship of Louis XI, who died soon after. She was raised as a fille de France and prepared for her future role as Queen of France. Portrait of Margaret aged ten by Jean Hey, c. 1490 Under the supervision of her grande governess Madame de Segr√©, and fianc√©'s sister-regent, Anne of France or \\"Madame la Grande\\", Margaret received a fine education alongside several noble children, amongst whom was Louise of Savoy. Her studies presumably included politics, civic participation, mathematics, geometry, the languages French, Spanish and Italian, literature, rhetoric, etiquette, and music. She was well read, had interest in architecture, played several instruments, and wrote poetry. Although their union was political, the young Margaret developed genuine affection for Charles. However, he renounced the treaty in the autumn of 1491 and married her former stepmother Anne, Duchess of Brittany, for political reasons. The French court had ceased treating Margaret as their future queen early and she couldn't return to her stepgrandmother's court until June 1493 after the Treaty of Senlis had been signed in May that year. She was hurt by Charles's actions and was left with a feeling of enduring resentment towards the House of Valois. Marriages =Princess of Asturias= Pieter van Coninxloo, Philip the Handsome and Margaret of Austria, c. 1493‚Äì1495. Betrothal diptych, National Gallery, London. In order to achieve an alliance with Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, Maximilian started negotiating the marriage of their only son and heir, John, Prince of Asturias, to Margaret, as well as the marriage of their daughter Juana to Philip. Margaret left the Netherlands for Spain late in 1496. Her engagement to the Prince of Asturias seemed doomed when the ship carrying her to Spain hit a storm in the Bay of Biscay. In haste, she wrote her own epitaph should she not reach Spain: However, Margaret actually married Prince John on April 3 the following year in Burgos Cathedral. Although it was a political alliance, it was a good marriage and John was devoted to the Princess, who was fun- loving and had a sharp sense of humor. Tragically, John died of a fever after only six months, on 4 October. Margaret was left pregnant, but she gave birth to a premature stillborn daughter on 2 April 1498.N. de Arag√≥n in: geneall.net [retrieved 7 October 2015]. With neither husband nor heir, Margaret served no great geo-political purpose in Spain. Her parents-in-law treated her kindly and reluctantly bid her farewell when she departed for the Low Countries in September 1499 at Maximilian's insistence. Back in Flanders, the Dowager Princess of Asturias attended the baptism of her nephew, the future Charles V, on March 7, 1500. Her brother and sister-in-law invited her to be godmother to their newborn son. =Duchess of Savoy= In 1501, Margaret married Philibert II, Duke of Savoy (1480‚Äì1504), whose realm played a decisive role in the rivalry between France and the Habsburgs in Italy on account of its strategic position in the Western Alps. Devoted to the hunt and his wife, Philibert showed little interest in governing his domains. Margaret willingly managed his affairs from their residence in the castle of Pont d'Ain at Bourg. Of those years in Italy, Ghislaine de Boom wrote: \\"For the first time, Margaret was revealed as an able and energetic woman, even imperious.\\" The union was extremely happy, but childless and brief. By 1504, Philibert died of pleurisy. Grief-stricken, Margaret threw herself out of a window, but was saved. After being persuaded to bury her husband, she had his heart embalmed so she could keep it with her forever. The Dowager Duchess cut off her long blonde hair and donned widow's clothing. She considered taking religious vows for a while, but instead endowed the construction of a monastery at Brou with an elaborate tomb for Philibert and herself with the words \\"FORTUNE. INFORTUNE. FORT. UNE\\" (\\"Fortune strongly persecutes a woman\\"). Margaret remained in Savoy for two years following her husband's death. Without her consent, Philip and Maximilian negotiated her marriage to King Henry VII of England. She refused to cooperate, determined to avoid further marital sorrow. Her court historian and poet Jean Lemaire de Belges gave her the title \\"Dame de deuil\\" (Lady of Mourning).Gonkdo, Michal (2006). Dame de Deuil. Musical Offerings for Marguerite of Austria (1480-1530), 3. CD Booklet KTC 4011 Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands Engraving of Margaret of Austria as Governor of the Netherlands In 1504, Queen Isabella died in late 1504, raising Philip and Juana, who eventually went to Castille to claim the crown. Their eldest son stayed behind, for the Burgundians refused to accept him as their ruler unless he were raised in the Low Countries. After Phillip's death, the House of Habsburg went into a new crisis: Charles was the new Sovereign of the Low Countries, but he was young and alone. Juana couldn't return to raise him because her unstable mental state and her Castilian subjects wouldn't allow their ruler to abandon the kingdom. With Charles too young to govern, the provinces of the Low Countries voted to make Maximilian their regent. Preoccupied with his affairs in Germany, the now Emperor named Margaret governor of the Low Countries and guardian of Charles in 1507, along with her nieces Eleanor, Isabella and Mary. She became the only woman elected as its ruler by the representative assembly of Franche-Comt√©, with her title confirmed in 1509. Although her mother was a previous sovereign of the Netherlands, Margaret was always considered a foreigner because of her childhood at the French court. She knew neither Dutch nor German, and her principal advisers, such as Mercurino di Gattinara, were Italians who had followed her north. In any case, the Governess acted as intermediary between her father and her nephew's subjects in the Netherlands from her newly built palace at Mechelen. During a remarkably successful career, she broke new ground for women rulers.Enno van Gelder, H.A. en Van Houtte, J.A. (1971). Margaretha van Oostenrijk, in: Grote Winkler Prins, vol. 12, p. 610-611. Amsterdam, Elsevier. While she lavished great care on her young nephew's education, Margaret immediately confronted his tutor William de Croy, lord of Chi√®vres and a dominant political figure at court. He retained the boy's trust, but his pro-French leanings brought him into conflict with her support for the Emperor. Jealous of her power, Croy and some nobles secretly pressed Emperor Maximilian to declare Charles of age to rule. The Estates paid Maximilian to resign as regent and installed Charles, who was not yet 15 years old, on 1515. Margaret's dethronement was a public humiliation. In his aunt's place, Charles established a council of regency, in which she was part but had no vote in its deliberations. Her ministers found themselves thrust aside and even persecuted. Maximilian shortly saw his mistake towards his intelligent, angry daughter, but Croy completely dominated Charles and urged upon him policies that not only conflicted with Habsburg interests, but gave little in return. King Ferdinand's death opened the way to her nephew's Spanish inheritance, but he had to go to Spain to claim it. After participating in councils with Croy and his ministers for a while, Charles soon recognized his need for Margaret and her ministers. In June 1518, he appointed Gattinara chancellor and helped arrange Margaret's return as regent of the Low Countries. On a subsequent visit to the Low Countries in mid-1520, Charles made Margaret his governor-general \\"in consideration of the great, inestimable and praiseworthy services that our said lady and aunt has done us.\\" He recognized his aunt as one of his wisest advisers and the only regent he ever re-appointed indefinitely from 1519 until her death in on 1 December 1530.Enno van Gelder, H.A. en Van Houtte, J.A. (1971). Margaretha van Oostenrijk, in: Grote Winkler Prins, vol. 12, p. 610-611. Amsterdam, Elsevier. =Economy= The Palace of Coudenberg from a 17th-century painting. Brussels served as one of the main revenues of the Imperial court of Charles V in the Low Countries. Margaret possessed aptitude for business and maintained the prosperity of the Netherlands. She negotiated the restoration of Intercursus Magnus with England, which was favorable to the Flemish cloth interests and brought huge profits. Because of the trade, industry and wealth of the regions and cities she oversaw, the Low Countries represented an important income for the Imperial treasury. Margaret provided funds for her nephew's troops and supplies for effective wars, especially against King Francis I of France and the German Protestants. In following years, Habsburg forces consolidated their hold over Tournai, Friesland, Utrecht, and Overijssel, which became part of the Netherlands. =Internal conflict= Although the Low Countries initially lacked any centralized political institutions, Margaret's reign was a period of relative peace for the Netherlands. The exception was the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, especially in the north. The first martyrs were burnt at the stake in 1523. More moderate than her nephew, the Governess feared that intense persecution of Protestants would only strengthen them. She had some difficulty in keeping Duke Charles of Guelders under control, but made him sign the Treaty of Gorinchem in 1528. Despite her efforts, the problem was not conclusively dealt with during her reign. =Foreign Policy= Louise of Savoy, whom Margaret negotiated the terms of the Treaty of Cambrai with. Margaret soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles's requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders as Duke of Burgundy. To preserve the Low Countries for her nephew, she persuaded Emperor Maximilian to make peace with King Louis XII. She journeyed to Cambrai in November 1508 to form the League of Cambrai, which largely removed the French threat to the Low Countries. To curb Croy's pro-French influence over Charles, Margaret persuaded her father to join a papal alliance with Spain and England against France in 1513, although she maintained the Low Countries in neutrality. They created a council containing representatives of Emperor Maximilian, King Ferdinand, and King Henry VIII. Given her father's poor health, Margaret and Charles began to negotiate the latter's election as Holy Roman Emperor despite the papacy and French strongly opposed to this. Thinking first of the dynasty, the Governess suggested supporting instead her younger nephew Ferdinand, but Charles refused to withdraw. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery, she played a crucial role in the election of Charles as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. Journeying to Cambrai again in 1529, Margaret reunited with Louise of Savoy, his sister-in-law and mother of Francis I. They negotiated the end to a war that France could no longer sustain. The Treaty of Cambrai, the so-called Ladies' Peace, favored the dynastic interests of Charles: Besides withdrawing French forces from Italy, Francis renounced his claims to Flanders, Artois and Tournai. Patronage of the arts Inner courtyard of Margaret of Austria's Palace, an early 16th-century building in Mechelen, Belgium. It was one of the first Renaissance buildings in northern Europe. Once she was declared Governor of the Netherlands, Margaret purchased the palace of Jean Laurin, Lord of Watervliet, located in the Korte Maagdenstraat (Virgins Short Street). She found the residence too small and started an ambitious expansion campaign in 1507. From 1517 to 1530, the architect Rombout II Keldermans furthered the project along the Keizerstraat (Emperor Street) and modified what became the rear wing, which faces the Palace of Margaret of York. The Governess kept several painters at her court, including the Master of the Legend of the Magdalen and Pieter van Coninxloo. Margaret possessed a rich library, consisting mostly of missals, poetry, historical and ethical treatises, which included the works of Christine de Pizan and the famous illuminated Tr√®s Riches Heures du duc de Berry.Schreurs, Eugeen; Vendrix; Philippe (2005).

Visiting her palace in 1521, Albrecht D√ºrer wondered at her many \\"precious things and precious library.\\" Margaret ended up raising her nephew and nieces in her palace. Her court was visited by the great humanists of her time, including Erasmus, Adrian of Utrecht (later Pope Adrian VI), and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa.Triest, Monica (2000).

Agrippa dedicated his arguably feminist work Declamation on the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female Sex to her. The Governor was so impressed with diplomant Thomas Boleyn's charm that she offered his daughter Anne Boleyn (future Queen consort of England) a temporary place in her household. She reported to the English nobleman that the little girl was \\"so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me.\\" Margaret ordered several splendid music manuscripts from Pierre Alamire to send them as gifts to her relatives and political relations.Kellman, Herbert (ed.)

Hern√°n Cort√©s had presented Charles V with treasures received from the Aztec King Moctezuma in 1519.

Death and Burial Tomb of Margaret of Austria, Monastery of Brou, Bourg-en-Bresse According to a legend about Margaret's death, one of her maids broke a glass goblet, a splinter of glass went into her foot, and the resulting wound became gangrenous. Her doctors strongly recommended that she agree to having her foot amputated. She gave her consent for the operation and received the sacrament, but she died before the operation from an overdose of opium given to her for the treatment.Gristwood, Sarah (2016). Game of Queens. New York: Basic Books. p. 149. In reality, however, Margaret's health had declined since 1527 and an abscessed leg had tormented her during the negotiations in Cambrai. On November 20, 1530, a high fever caused by her infected leg forced her to bed and neither piety nor medicine made any headway against the spreading gangrene. She died shortly after midnight on December 1. The Emperor bemoaned \\"the loss that we have made and principally I who held her as a mother and for the lack she does me in the government of the countries where she was in charge. Margaret's will appointed Charles as her sole heir and urged her nephew to protect the sovereignty of the Low Countries against the centralizing tendency of his imperial administrators. She was buried alongside her second husband at Bourg-en-Bresse, in the magnificent mausoleum of the Royal Monastery of Brou that she previously commissioned. There is a statue of the Governess next to the Cathedral of Mechelen.

This is because the text of the German‚ÄìSpanish Treaty of 1899 which transferred sovereignty of certain Spanish possessions in the Pacific to Germany, namely the Northern Mariana Islands (except Guam) and the Caroline Islands (including Palau), failed to include these smaller islands.

He was the father of Stephen F. Austin, one of the earliest American settlers of Texas, which was at the time part of Mexico. After receiving a land grant from the Spanish Crown in 1820, Moses Austin planned to be the first to establish an Anglo-American settlement in Spanish Texas, but he died before his dream was realized. On his deathbed, he pleaded with his son to fulfill his dream to colonize Texas. Stephen led the colony to a now-sovereign Mexico in 1825, and in time, the settlers demanded autonomy and later won independence from Mexico under President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, thereby establishing the Republic of Texas. Biography Coat of Arms of Moses Austin Moses Austin was born October 4, 1761 to Elias Austin and Eunice Phelps Austin in Durham, Connecticut. In 1784, he moved to Philadelphia to enter the dry goods business with his brother, Stephen. He then moved to Richmond, Virginia to open a second dry goods store. In 1785, he married into the affluent iron mining family of Mary Brown, who then became known as Mary Brown Austin. The Austins' second child was born in 1793 and named Stephen Fuller Austin in honor of his father's brother and his mother's great uncle. Their daughter Emily Austin followed in 1795. A second son, James Elijah Brown Austin, was born in 1803. Austin sought to start his own mining business in southwestern Virginia, and in 1789 he traveled there to look at a lead mine. Moses saw potential in the site and by 1791 his family had joined him in what is now Wythe County. Moses and his brother Stephen and several other partners and individuals industrialized the area. Several smelters, furnaces, commissaries, the Jackson Ferry Shot Tower, blacksmith shops, liveries, and mills were established. The tiny village around the mines became known as \\"Austinville\\", and Moses came to be known as the \\"Lead King\\". Moses Austin house in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, April 2007 The Austin brothers soon incurred debts, causing the collapse of the company. After the Virginia lead business failed, Moses skipped out to avoid imprisonment and the consequences of debt, which was then customary for debtors in the U.S. under traditional English law (now being developed for U.S. federal and state codes), and looked toward the rich lead deposits in Missouri, then a part of upper Spanish Louisiana.Edmondson (2000), p. 56. In December 1797, Austin and a companion traveled to investigate the Spanish mines. In 1798, the Spanish colonial government granted to Moses one league (4,428 acres). In return he swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown and stated he would settle some families in Missouri. Stephen remained behind to salvage the Virginia business, creating a rift between the two brothers that would last for much of the rest of their lives. The state of Virginia seized much of the property Moses owned and broke up the various operations, which were later purchased from the state at great discounts by Thomas Jackson and his partners. In 1803, Missouri came under the jurisdiction of the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Austin became founder and principal stockholder in the Bank of St. Louis, but the bank failed in the Panic of 1819, causing him to lose his entire fortune. He again sought help from Spain. In 1820, Austin traveled to the Presidio San Antonio de B√©xar in Spanish Texas and presented a plan to colonize Texas with Anglo-Americans to Governor Antonio Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez. In 1821, the governor asked Austin's friend, Erasmo Segu√≠n, to give him the news that he had been awarded a land grant and permission to settle three hundred families in Texas. On Austin's return trip, he became ill, and he died in June 1821, shortly after arriving back in Missouri. His son Stephen F. Austin carried out his colonization plan several years later, and led the three hundred families to what became the first Anglo-American settlement in Texas. In 1885, the legality of Austin's Spanish property claims were settled posthumously by the U.S. Supreme Court in Bryan v. Kennett. Family Moses Austin had many relatives who helped settle Texas, including Stephen F. Austin and Emily Austin Perry (daughter), Moses Austin Bryan (grandson), and others. Moses Austin should be distinguished from his grandson Moses Austin Bryan. James Bryan was his first son-in-law; James F. Perry was his second son-in-law. The Missouri State Archives reflect that Moses Austin lived in a mansion called Durham Hall, named for his birth town of Durham, Connecticut. Settlement in Texas =Motivation to settle= Displays the new border established by the Adams-On√≠s Treaty, making Texas part of Spain. Moses Austin attempted various economic ventures before his plans to settle in Texas came to fruition. Austin failed to successfully maintain the St. Louis Bank and his financial situation suffered from unfavorable shipment deals. Austin's desperation reached a climax in 1820 when a Missouri sheriff threatened to break down his door to collect past debts. Austin's son, Stephen F. Austin, also continued to seek employment in Mississippi and Arkansas to help his poor financial situation. In November 1820, Austin learned that the United States passed the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty with Spain, which situated present-day Texas in New Spain's territory. Moses Austin hoped the Spanish government would permit free trade with the United States so he left for Texas to try and begin a new economic venture. Mary Brown Austin, Moses Austin's wife, wrote to her cousin explaining Moses's plans to colonize Texas in order to provide for their family. =Negotiations with Spain= Monument of Baron de Bastrop, Austin's business partner in Texas. Austin's primary intention was to create a trading venture on the coast of Texas to allow the United States to trade with New Spain. On December 23, 1820, Austin arrived in San Antonio to begin negotiations with the Spanish government to establish a trading post. After some difficulty on his own, Austin paired with a Spanish interpreter, Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, who agreed to join Austin and plan a settlement called \\"Austina\\" which would be located somewhere on the coast of Texas. On December 26, 1820, Austin and Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop presented a formal petition to Governor Antonio Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez. They requested permission to bring three hundred families to a port in Texas. Most importantly, Austin insisted that the settlers were former subjects of Spain and would be willing to defend the land against foreign enemies. Austin convinced Spain to reinstate the empresario system in Texas, which resulted in permission to begin a new settlement in Texas. This outdated reward system granted tracts of land to immigrants who pledged their allegiance to the Spanish crown. Therefore, Austin's settlement was contingent upon its allegiance to the Spanish Crown. =Plan for settlement= After returning from successful negotiations in San Antonio, Austin returned to Missouri to recruit settlers for his new settlement. In April, he created a ‚ÄúForm of Contract for Emigration to Texas‚Äù which detailed the obligations of each member joining the settlement in Texas. Austin required emigrants to help build community structures. He also ordered the settlers to own a ‚ÄúSpanish carbine‚Äù, a type of gun, to protect the settlement. Austin's relationship with the settlers he recruited was not one of mutual respect, but rather he employed the settlers. Austin contracted his settlers to work from their departure in May, until the following January. In return, Austin guaranteed transportation along with the necessary tools and provisions to begin the settlement.Austin, M., Barker, Eugene C, & Austin, Stephen F. (1924). The Austin papers. Govt. print. off. Although Moses Austin died prior to his planned departure, his son, Stephen F. Austin, continued his efforts to colonize Texas. Austin triggered such a substantial movement of people into Texas, the land became inundated with Americans. Austin's push to settle Texas contributed to the Texas Revolution in 1836 which foreshadowed Texas's integration into the United States in 1845.

Explanation  Downloading large amounts of data over the Internet for software updates can induce high network traffic problems, especially when a network of computers is involved. Binary Delta Compression technology allows a major reduction of download size by only transferring the difference between the old and the new files during the update process.  Implementation  In real-world implementations, it is common to also use standard compression techniques (such as Lempel-Ziv) while compressing. This makes sense because LZW already works by referring back to re-used strings. ZDelta is a good example of this, as it is built from ZLib. The algorithm works by referring to common patterns not only in the file to be compressed, but also in a source file. The benefits of this are that even if there are few similarities between the original and the new file, a good data compression ratio is attained.

Richard Jewson of the Jewson timber merchants and former Lord Mayor of Norwich was a member of the board until retiring in 1947. = Corrugated iron buildings = In the 1880s Boulton & Paul were leading manufacturers of kits for corrugated iron buildings, which arrived in packing crated ready to be erected. Woodhall Spa Cottage Museum is a well-preserved example of a Boulton & Paul corrugated building. = Aircraft manufacture = In 1915, Boulton & Paul began to construct aircraft under contract including 550 of the Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b. Fe.2 construction was passed over to another East Anglian company so Boulton Paul could concentrate on production of more advanced designs. Their extensive use of jigs and the manufacture of the smaller fittings required meant that they could maintain fast production. A new production site was built and an assembly and proving ground developed on Mousehold Heath in Norwich rather than transport the aircraft to the Army at Thetford. During the war the company built more Sopwith Camels than any other manufacturer. Success as a builder of aircraft led to the company forming a design department but none of its resulting aircraft made a significant impact while the war lasted. The P.3 Bobolink fighter was overshadowed by the Sopwith Snipe and the Armistice beat the P.7 Bourges fighter-bomber into production. Boulton & Paul developed steel-framed aircraft under their designer John Dudley North. The first was the Boulton & Paul P.10 which used steel tubes rolled from sheet metal. It was exhibited ‚Äì but not flown ‚Äì at the Paris Air Show in 1919. Official interest in metal frame designs led to an order of a single Boulton & Paul Bolton, a twin-engine bomber design. In the same period Boulton & Paul produced another metal framed design, the Bodmin, with its engines in the fuselage. North believed that a metal frame could be 10% lighter than an equivalent wooden frame. After World War I, Boulton & Paul made their mark with the introduction of powered and enclosed defensive machine gun turrets for bombers. Their Sidestrand twin- engined biplane bomber, which could fly at 140 mph, had an exposed nose turret that was clearly inadequate. The subsequent Overstrand bomber featured the world's first enclosed, power-operated turret, mounting a single Lewis gun and propelled by compressed air. The company licensed a French design of an electro-hydraulic four-gun turret that became a major feature of their future production. In addition to fitting turrets to bombers, Boulton & Paul was to install them in fighters. Boulton & Paul provided most of the structure for the R101 airship; the completed sections being transported to Cardington for assembly there. The R101 subsequently flew over Norwich in return. In a depressed market in 1934, the aircraft division being its weakest, Boulton & Paul Ltd sold its aircraft manufacturing component from the main construction business to create Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd. This moved to Wolverhampton in 1936 as the area had a surplus of skilled labour and the council was able to provide an incentive in the form of a greenfield site and flying rights. In 1961 Boulton Paul Aircraft, by now a producer of aircraft equipment rather than complete aircraft, merged with the Dowty Group to form first Dowty Boulton Paul Ltd and then Dowty Aerospace.

She appears as a vengeance demon in seasons 6 and 7, and has previously appeared as Cecily in season 5. She is played by actress Kali Rocha. Halfrek Halfrek is a long-time associate and sometime friend of Anya, who knew her from her days as a vengeance demon. The two had worked together in the past, notably during the Russian Revolution of 1905. However, Halfrek's raison d'etre differed from Anya's. Whereas Anya was an avenger of scorned women, Halfrek's \\"thing\\" (as Anya put it) is to perform vengeance for children who have been wronged by their parents or guardians. Anya attributes this to \\"daddy issues\\". Even after Anya ceases to be a vengeance demon, she continues her friendship with Halfrek. Like Anyanka used the name Anya when masquerading as human, Halfrek's mortal persona goes by the name Hallie. In her second appearance in season 6, Halfrek poses as a guidance counselor and coaxes Dawn into making a wish. Feeling that no one wants to spend time with her, Dawn wishes that people would never leave; Halfrek therefore casts a spell that prevents anyone from leaving the Summers residence. The crisis ends when Halfrek herself is caught in the spell and has to break it. Halfrek also appears as a bridesmaid at the failed wedding of Anya and Xander. Early in season 7, Halfrek attempts to coax Anya back into vengeance, but Anya has spent too long as a mortal to return to her old life; while she was initially successful in her return to demonhood, she subsequently regrets the deaths she has caused. D'Hoffryn asks Anya what she wants, and she says that she wants to reverse the vengeance she had done. D'Hoffryn grants her wish, telling her that it'll require the sacrifice of a vengeance demon's body and soul. Believing she is about to die, Anya is resigned to her fate‚Äîonly to watch helplessly as D'Hoffryn summons her friend Halfrek and incinerates her in front of Anya. Cecily In the season 5 episode \\"Fool For Love\\", Halfrek uses the persona of Cecily while on a job to kill all the guests at a party Spike is attending. Cecily, being the upper-class object of the then-human William's affections in Victorian England circa 1880 spurns William's advances, saying he is \\"beneath her\\", and upsetting him greatly. This sets in motion the events that lead William to accept comfort from Drusilla, and become a vampire. (Cecily's surname was implied to be Underwood in the episode \\"Lies My Parents Told Me\\", but stated to be Addams in the script and credits of \\"Fool for Love\\" and the non-canon tie-in novel These Our Actors.) Identity In the season 6 episode \\"Older and Far Away\\", Halfrek recognizes Spike and calls him by his human name, William. Spike also recognizes Halfrek, but when asked to explain this they both sheepishly deny being acquainted. This implies that Halfrek had previously been Cecily. However, Halfrek and Anya witnessed the Crimean War (circa 1853) which is mentioned in \\"Lessons\\" and shown in \\"Selfless\\". The timing of this event would indicate that Halfrek existed as a demon at least three decades prior to the adoption of the youthful human form in Cecily. Joss Whedon and Kali Rocha have both stated that, in their minds at least, Halfrek and Cecily were indeed the same entity. Halfrek later appeared in the comic Spike: Old Times, which established that she was 'on a job' at the time that William fell for Cecily. She seems to have had at least some pity for William in spite of her rejection of him, as the night he became a vampire, she caused the deaths of the rude party-goers who had laughed at his poetry. Continuity-wise, the comic story takes place in Buffy Season 6, and assumes that Spike briefly left Sunnydale and visited LA.

The character, present for most of Season Seven, is played by D. B. Woodside. Biography Robin is the first (and only) principal of the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High School when Dawn Summers begins her sophomore year. At first, Buffy wonders if he may be evil, but nevertheless accepts a job offer from him. For much of the season, hints are dropped that Robin is aware of the mystical situation in Sunnydale ‚Äî he finds and buries Jonathan Levinson's body, for example ‚Äî but the viewer is left without any indication as to which side he fights for. Buffy is surprised at his youth. He is shown to have a good sense of humor and communicates well with students. He is a vegetarian and claims to have once been suspended for threatening to attack another student who bullied him during high school. Robin's easygoing attitude and confidence are in sharp contrast to the nervous Principal Flutie and strict disciplinarian Principal Snyder, making him a well-liked educator among the students, alumns, and faculty members. However, in the episode \\"Him,\\" a troubled student, RJ Brooks, develops a resentment towards Robin, leading to an attempt on Robin's life by Buffy (who was under RJ's family's love spell at the time); she attempted to kill Robin with her rocket launcher at one point until he is saved by Xander, Willow and Spike. In the episode \\"First Date,\\" it is revealed that Robin's mother, Nikki Wood (who was first seen in the episode \\"Fool for Love\\"), had been a Slayer in New York City, and that he is a \\"freelance\\" demon fighter. On a date with Buffy, Robin explains that his mother was killed by a vampire; he later learns, from the First Evil, that this vampire is Spike. He was raised and trained by Nikki's Watcher, not in New York but in Beverly Hills (according to the episode \\"Help\\"). As retribution for his mother's murder, Robin conspires with Giles to distract Buffy and kill Spike. However, the plan fails and Buffy realizes what has gone on, temporarily alienating Robin from the group. After Faith's return, Robin returns to the fold and becomes interested in Faith; the two become physically intimate in the episode \\"Touched\\", though it appears to be a one-night stand. Prior to the final battle in the episode \\"Chosen\\", Robin expresses concern that Faith views men as mere sex objects, and pledges to surprise her if they survive. =Post-Sunnydale= Robin appears in \\"No Future for You\\", the second arc of the canonical comic book series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight.

The pot is never or rarely emptied all the way, and ingredients and liquid are replenished as necessary. The concept is often a common element in descriptions of medieval inns. Foods prepared in a perpetual stew have been described as being flavorful due to the manner in which the foodstuffs blend together, in which the flavor may improve with age. Examples Perpetual stews were common in medieval cooking, often as pottage or pot-au-feu: A perpetual stew was maintained in Perpignan from the 15th century until World War II. Between August 2014 and April 2015, a New York restaurant served broth from the same perpetual stew (a master stock) for over eight months. Wattan Panich restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand, has continued to maintain the broth from the same perpetual stew for over 46 years (as of 2020). Ingredients Various ingredients can be used in a perpetual stew, such as root vegetables and tubers (onion, carrot, potato, garlic, parsnip, turnip, etc.) and various meats and game meats.

His direct, trenchant criticism of spiritual frauds and organized religions was enthusiastically received by audiences, initiating a new dynamism in the Rationalist movement, especially in Sri Lanka and India. Early life and career Abraham Kovoor was born in a Saint Thomas Christian family at Thiruvalla, Kerala. Kovoor was the son of Mr. & Mrs. Kovoor Iype Thoma Kathanar (Kovoor Achen), Vicar General of the Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar. He was educated at Bangabasi College, Calcutta. After working briefly as a lecturer in botany at C.M.S.College in Kerala, Kovoor arrived in Ceylon in February 1928. Before his arrival in Ceylon, Kovoor married Kunjamma, daughter of a judge. The couple had a son, Aries. Kovoor's first assignment in Ceylon was teaching botany at Jaffna College, Vaddukoddai for 15 years until 1943. Subsequently, he also taught at Richmond College, Galle, and St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia from 1947 to 1953, before retiring in 1959 as a teacher at Thurstan College, Colombo. He also practiced hypnotherapy and applied psychology. As a rationalist After retirement Kovoor devoted his life to the rationalist movement. He spent most of his time building up the Ceylon Rationalist Association, and was its president from 1960 to his death. He edited an annual journal, The Ceylon Rationalist Ambassador. Kovoor became a widower when his wife Konjamma died in 1976. In his will, he wrote as follows: \\"My body should not be buried on my death. The body of my wife also should not be buried. We have dedicated our bodies to the use of medical colleges on our death. I desire that my skeleton should be surrendered to Thurston College, Colombo, which I served for many years. I entrust this task to my son, Aries Kovoor, who is a professor at the Sorbonne University, Paris. My eyes should be donated to an eye bank immediately after death.\\" Kovoor died on 18 September 1978 due to cancer. Publications and Kovoor's challenge After his numerous encounters with god-men, astrologers, and other people who claimed to have psychic powers, Kovoor concluded that there was no objective truth to such claims. He wrote, \\"Nobody has and nobody ever had supernatural powers. They exist only in the pages of scriptures and sensation-mongering newspapers.\\" His books Begone Godmen and Gods, Demons and Spirits, about his encounters with people claiming psychic powers, are still bestsellers in India. In 1963, Kovoor announced an award of Rs. 100,000 for anyone who could demonstrate supernatural or miraculous powers under foolproof and fraud-proof conditions. The challenge listed 23 miracles or feats that godmen (and Western mystics and performers such as Uri Geller and Jeane Dixon) claimed to perform, such as reading the serial numbers from currency in sealed envelopes, materializing objects, predicting future events, converting liquids from one kind to another, and walking on water. Some sought publicity by taking on his challenge, but they forfeited the initial deposit amount. The Sri Lankan Rationalist Association, led by Professor Carlo Fonseka, renewed the challenge in 2012 and increased the reward to one million dollars. (Similar challenges have been posed by Basava Premanand and James Randi.) Legacy The Malayalam movie Punarjanmam (1972), Tamil movie Maru Piravi (1973) and Telugu film Ninthakatha were made on the basis of his case diary. Aamir Khan's character in PK (2014) is inspired by Kovoor. Bharathiya Yuktivadi Sangam declared a national award called the A. T. Kovoor Award for the Secular Artist. The first recipient was Indian film star Kamal Haasan in acknowledgment of his humanist activities and secular life. Kovoor's work remains controversial in India. In 2008, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, leader of Shiromani Akali Dal, imposed an \\"immediate ban\\" on Kovoor's God, Demons and Spirits, translated into Punjabi by Megh Raj Mitter. Basava Premanand, founder of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, is regarded as Kovoor's spiritual successor in India. republished article from The Times of India - The Sunday Review of 27 August 1995 Books by and on Kovoor =In English= # Begone Godmen - Jaico Publishing House, Mumbai, India # Gods, Demons and Spirits - Jaico Publishing House, Mumbai, India # Selected Works of A T Kovoor- Indian Atheist Publishers, New Delhi, India # Exposing Paranormal Claims - Indian CSICOP, Podannur, Tamil Nadu, India # Soul, Spiril, Rebirth & Possession - Indian CSICOP, Podannur, Tamil Nadu, India # On Christianity - Indian CSICOP, Podannur, Tamil Nadu, India # On Buddhism - Indian CSICOP, Podannur, Tamil Nadu, India # Astrology & Hinduism - Indian CSICOP, Podannur, Tamil Nadu, India =In Kannada= # Kovoor Kanda Vaigynanika Sathyagalu, (Anuvaada - K.

Rock and roll influenced daily life, fashion, attitudes and language in a way few other social developments have equalled. As the original generations of rock and roll fans matured, the music became an accepted and deeply interwoven thread in popular culture. Beginning in the early 1950s, rock songs and acts began to be used in a few television commercials; within a decade this practice became widespread, and rock music also featured in film and television program soundtracks.  Race  In the crossover of African American \\"race music\\" to a growing white youth audience, the popularization of rock and roll involved both black performers reaching a white audience and white performers appropriating African-American music.M. Fisher, Something in the air: radio, rock, and the revolution that shaped a generation (Marc Fisher, 2007), p. 53. Rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the United States were entering a new phase, with the beginnings of the civil rights movement for desegregation, leading to the Supreme Court ruling that abolished the policy of \\"separate but equal\\" in 1954, but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the United States.H. Zinn, A people's history of the United States: 1492‚Äìpresent (Pearson Education, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 450. The coming together of white youth audiences and black music in rock and roll, inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the US, with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color.G. C. Altschuler, All shook up: how rock 'n' roll changed America (Oxford: Oxford University Press US, 2003), p. 35. Many observers saw rock and roll as heralding the way for desegregation, in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience.M. T. Bertrand, Race, rock, and Elvis (University of Illinois Press, 2000), pp. 95‚Äì6. Many authors have argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves. Sex and drugs The rock and roll lifestyle was popularly associated with sex and drugs. Many of rock and roll's early stars (as well as their jazz and blues counterparts) were known as hard-drinking, hard-living characters. During the 1960s the lifestyles of many stars became more publicly known, aided by the growth of the underground rock press. Musicians had always attracted attention of \\"groupies\\" (girls who followed musicians) who spent time with and often performed sexual favors for band members. As the stars' lifestyles became more public, the popularity and promotion of recreational drug use by musicians may have influenced use of drugs and the perception of acceptability of drug use among the youth of the period. For example, when in the late 1960s the Beatles, who had previously been marketed as clean-cut youths, started publicly acknowledging using LSD, many fans followed. Journalist Al Aronowitz wrote \\"...whatever the Beatles did was acceptable, especially for young people.\\" Jerry Garcia, of the rock band Grateful Dead said, \\"For some people, taking LSD and going to Grateful Dead show functions like a rite of passage ... we don't have a product to sell; but we do have a mechanism that works.\\" In the late 1960s and early 1970s, much of the rock and roll cachet associated with drug use dissipated as rock music suffered a series of drug-related deaths, including the 27 Club-member deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison. Although some amount of drug use remained common among rock musicians, a greater respect for the dangers of drug consumption was observed, and many anti-drug songs became part of the rock lexicon, notably \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" by Neil Young (1972). Many rock musicians, including John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Stevie Nicks, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, Bon Scott, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Steven Tyler, Scott Weiland, Sly Stone, Madonna, Ozzy Osbourne, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Layne Staley, Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love, Lemmy, Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown, Buffy Sainte Marie, Dave Matthews, David Crosby, Anthony Kiedis, Dave Mustaine, David Bowie, Richard Wright, Phil Rudd, Elton John, Phil Anselmo, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Joe Walsh, and others, have acknowledged battling addictions to many substances including alcohol, cocaine and heroin; many of these have successfully undergone drug rehabilitation programs, but others have died. During the 21st century opioid crisis, local musicians in Asheville, NC, seeing the need for drug overdose harm reduction in the music industry, founded Musicians for Overdose Protection, a volunteer group that visits bars, night clubs and other live music sites in Buncombe County NC. The group distributes Narcan (Nalaxone) nasal spray kits to overcome opioid and heroin overdose. The kits were supplied by the Buncombe County Health and Human Services department. The program has been welcomed by the music venue owners, particularly because the Narcan is administered by nasal spray rather than by injection. In the early 1980s. along with the rise of the band Minor Threat, a straight edge lifestyle became popular. The straight edge philosophy of abstinence from recreational drugs, alcohol, tobacco and sex became associated with some hardcore punks through the years, and both remain popular with youth today. Fashion A Mohawked French punk Rock music and fashion have been inextricably linked. In the mid-1960s of the UK, rivalry arose between \\"Mods\\" (who favoured 'modern' Italian-led fashion) and \\"Rockers\\" (who wore motorcycle leathers), each style had their own favored musical acts. (The controversy would form the backdrop for The Who's rock opera Quadrophenia). In the 1960s, The Beatles brought mop-top haircuts, collarless blazers, and Beatle Boots into fashion. Rock musicians were also early adopters of hippie fashion and popularised such styles as long hair and the Nehru jacket. As rock music genres became more segmented, what an artist wore became as important as the music itself in defining the artist's intent and relationship to the audience. In the early 1970s, glam rock became widely influential featuring glittery fashions, high heels and camp. In the late 1970s, disco acts helped bring flashy urban styles to the mainstream, while punk groups began wearing mock- conservative attire, (including suit jackets and skinny ties), in an attempt to be as unlike mainstream rock musicians, who still favored blue jeans and hippie-influenced clothes. Heavy Metal bands in the 1980s often favoured a strong visual image. For some bands, this consisted of leather or denim jackets and pants, spike/studs and long hair. Visual image was a strong component of the glam metal movement. In 1981, MTV was formed, marking a large shift in the music world. Because MTV would become such a cultural force, the young would look toward MTV. Fashion happened to be one of those cultural centers that the Television company would have a great effect on. With debuts like Madonna's Iconic underwear-as-outerwear look and the companies featuring heavy metal as well as new wave and other genera that would go to promote each artist's brand of fashion into the greater culture, because of the sheer amount of visibility that MTV gave these artist through music videos and other content that the television channel had. In the early 1990s, the popularity of grunge brought in a punk influenced fashion of its own, including torn jeans, old shoes, flannel shirts, backwards baseball hats, and people grew their hair against the clean-cut image that was popular at the time in heavily commercialized pop music culture. Musicians continue to be fashion icons; pop- culture magazines such as Rolling Stone often include fashion layouts featuring musicians as models. Authenticity In the Goth subculture, individuals who are perceived as not truly sharing the values of the subculture are deemed to be \\"inauthentic\\". Rock musicians and fans have consistently struggled with the paradox of \\"selling out\\"‚Äîto be considered \\"authentic\\", rock music must keep a certain distance from the commercial world and its constructs; however it is widely believed that certain compromises must be made in order to become successful and to make music available to the public. This dilemma has created friction between musicians and fans, with some bands going to great lengths to avoid the appearance of \\"selling out\\" (while still finding ways to make a lucrative living). In some styles of rock, such as punk and heavy metal, a performer who is believed to have \\"sold out\\" to commercial interests may be labelled with the pejorative term \\"poseur\\". If a performer first comes to public attention with one style, any further stylistic development may be seen as selling out to long-time fans. On the other hand, managers and producers may progressively take more control of the artist, as happened, for instance, in Elvis Presley's swift transition in species from \\"The Hillbilly Cat\\" to \\"your teddy bear\\". It can be difficult to define the difference between seeking a wider audience and selling out. Ray Charles left behind his classic formulation of rhythm and blues to sing country music, pop songs and soft-drink commercials. In the process, he went from a niche audience to worldwide fame. Bob Dylan faced consternation from fans for embracing the electric guitar. In the end, it is a moral judgement made by the artist, the management, and the audience. Charitable and social causes Love and peace were very common themes in rock music during the 1960s and 1970s. Rock musicians have often attempted to address social issues directly as commentary or as calls to action. During the Vietnam War the first rock protest songs were heard, inspired by the songs of folk musicians such as Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, which ranged from abstract evocations of peace Peter, Paul and Mary's \\"If I Had a Hammer\\" to blunt anti-establishment diatribes Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \\"Ohio\\". Other musicians, notably John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were vocal in their anti-war sentiment both in their music and in public statements with songs such as \\"Imagine\\", and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". Famous rock musicians have adopted causes ranging from the environment (Marvin Gaye's \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\") and the Anti- Apartheid Movement (Peter Gabriel's \\"Biko\\"), to violence in Northern Ireland (U2's \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\") and worldwide economic policy (the Dead Kennedys' \\"Kill the Poor\\"). Another notable protest song is Patti Smith's recording \\"People Have the Power.\\" On occasion this involvement would go beyond simple songwriting and take the form of sometimes-spectacular concerts or televised events, often raising money for charity and awareness of global issues. Rock and roll as social activism reached a milestone in the Live Aid concerts, held July 13, 1985, which were an outgrowth of the 1984 charity single \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" and became the largest musical concert in history with performers on two main stages, one in London, England and the other in Philadelphia, USA (plus some other acts performing in other countries) and televised worldwide. The concert lasted 16 hours and featured nearly everybody who was in the forefront of rock and pop in 1985. The charity event raised millions of dollars for famine relief in Africa. Live Aid became a model for many other fund-raising and consciousness-raising efforts, including the Farm Aid concerts for family farmers in North America, and televised performances benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks. Live Aid itself was reprised in 2005 with the Live 8 concert, to raise awareness of global economic policy. Environmental issues have also been a common theme, one example being Live Earth. Religion Songwriters such as Pete Townshend have explored these spiritual aspects within their work. The common usage of the term \\"rock god\\" acknowledges the religious quality of the adulation some rock stars receive. John Lennon became infamous for a statement he made in 1966 that The Beatles were \\"more popular than Jesus\\".Evening Standard, March 4, 1966 However, he later said that this statement was misunderstood and not meant to be anti-Christian.Chicago Press Conference Transcript \\"Chicago Press Conference\\" Iron Maiden, Ozzy Osbourne, King Diamond, Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin, Marilyn Manson, Slayer and numerous others have also been accused of being satanists, immoral or otherwise having an \\"evil\\" influence on their listeners. Anti-religious sentiments also appear in punk and hardcore. There's the example of the song \\"Filler\\" by Minor Threat, the name and famous logo of the band Bad Religion and criticism of Christianity and all religions is an important theme in anarcho-punk and crust punk. =Christianity= Christian rock, alternative rock, metal, punk, and hardcore are specific, identifiable genres of rock music with strong Christian overtones and influence. Many groups and individuals who are not considered to be Christian rock artists have religious beliefs themselves. For example; The Edge and Bono of U2 are a Methodist and an Anglican, respectively; Bruce Springsteen is a Roman Catholic; and Brandon Flowers of The Killers is a Latter Day Saint. Carlos Santana, Ted Nugent, and John Mellencamp are all other examples of rock stars who profess some form of Christian faith. However, some conservative Christians single out the music genres of hip hop and rock as well as blues and jazz as containing jungle beats, or jungle music, and claim that it is a beat or musical style that is inherently evil, immoral, or sensual. Thus, according to them, any song in the rap, hip hop and rock genres is inherently evil because of the song's musical beat, regardless of the song's lyrics or message. A few even extend this analysis even to Christian rock songs. Christian conservative author David Noebel is one of the most notable opponents of the existence of jungle beats. In his writings and speeches, Noebel held that the use of such beats in music was a communist plot to subvert the morality of the youth of the United States. Pope Benedict XVI was quoted as saying, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation, that \\"Rock... is the expression of the elemental passions, and at rock festivals it assumes a sometimes cultic character, a form of worship, in fact, in opposition to Christian worship.\\" =Satanism= Some metal bands use demonic imagery for artistic and/or entertainment purposes, though they do not worship or believe in Satan. Ozzy Osbourne is reported to be Anglican and Alice Cooper is a known born-again Christian. In some cases, though, metal performers have expressed satanic views. Numerous others in the early Norwegian black metal scene were Satanists.The most known example of this is Euronymous, who claimed that he worshiped Satan as a god. Varg Vikernes (back then called \\"the Count\\" or Grishnak) has also been called a Satanisthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5nWw12iqF8, even through he has rejected that label. Even within this localized musical subgenre, however, the arson attacks against Christian churches and other centers of worship were condemned by some prominent figures within the Norwegian black metal scene, such as Kjetil Manheim.Martin Ledang, P√•l Aasdal (2008).

The candy is made by mixing its ingredients and heating them until they melt, then exposing the mixture to pressurized carbon dioxide gas (about 600 pounds per square inch) and allowing it to cool. The process causes tiny high pressure bubbles to be trapped inside the candy. When placed in the mouth, coming into contact with saliva the candy breaks and dissolves, releasing the carbon dioxide from the tiny bubbles, resulting in a popping and sizzling sound and leaving a slight tingling sensation. The bubbles in the candy pieces can be viewed when aided by a microscope.

The first minivan sold by Ford, the Aerostar was sold in a single generation from the 1986 to 1997 model years. Introduced shortly before the Ford Taurus, the vehicle derived its nameplate from its slope-nosed \\"one-box\\" exterior (although over six feet tall, the body of the Aerostar retained a , besting the Lincoln Mark VII). For the 1995 model year, the front-wheel drive Ford Windstar was introduced to replace the Aerostar; both minivans were sold concurrently through the 1997 model year. In the Ford model line, the role of the Aerostar cargo van was left unfilled; the closest successor is the Ford Transit Connect, introduced in 2010. A total of 2,029,577 Aerostars were produced from 1985 to 1997. All production was sourced from the now-closed St. Louis Assembly Plant in Hazelwood, Missouri. Development =Carousel: the garageable van= At Ford, development of a minivan began in the early 1970s, starting life as a companion model to the third-generation Ford Econoline/Club Wagon. As its full-size van was slated to grow in size for its 1975 redesign, Ford explored the concept of a \\"garageable van\\", using a roofline with a height to easily fit through a typical garage door opening. Additional objectives for the vehicle would include increased interior space over station wagons and more attractive styling over full-size vans. Dubbed the Ford Carousel, a prototype was tested from 1972 to 1974. To achieve its \\"garageable\\" status, its roofline was lowered approximately 12 inches in comparison to a standard-wheelbase Ford Club Wagon (placing its height close to that of the Ford Windstar/Freestar). Along with restyled A-pillars and a completely new front fascia, the Carousel received a wagon- style roofline (with wraparound window glass); in a key indication of its future as family-oriented vehicle, the Carousel wore a rear tailgate with a drop-down rear window with simulated exterior woodgrain trim. Inside, it was fitted with two rear bench seats with interior trim similar to the Ford Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park. While the Ford Carousel received a positive response by many Ford executives for a potential 1976 introduction, it ultimately would not reach production. While financial constraints forced the company to divert funds towards critical projects (such as the Fox platform and Panther platform), the 1973 energy crisis played a major role as well (the prototype was fitted with a 460 V8, shared with full-size Ford vehicles and one-ton Ford trucks). In 1978, Lee Iaccoca and Hal Sperlich both departed Ford and were hired by Chrysler; the Chrysler minivan project was approved by the end of 1979. While adopting the basic \\"garageable van\\" concept of the Ford Carousel prototype, the resulting 1984 Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were far different vehicles in terms of layout and engineering. =Aerostar: all-new design= During the early 1980s, as the American automotive industry learned of the development of the Chrysler minivans, Ford commenced development of its own vehicle in response. The energy crises of the late 1970s had made fuel economy a high priority of vehicle design; as such, producing the Ford Carousel (downsizing the Ford Club Wagon to a lower height) would not be a competitive option for Ford. While using the 6-foot height of the Carousel as a starting point in concept, the 1980s Ford \\"garageable van\\" was a completely clean-sheet design. In a major shift, the new design shifted mechanical commonality from full-size trucks and vans to the compact Ford Ranger in an effort to reduce weight. In what would be a major break from the Chrysler and GM minivans, the Ford minivan received a distinct chassis (with model-specific front and rear suspension). To further improve fuel economy, Ford added a number of lightweight materials for the body, using plastic bumpers, fuel tanks, liftgate doors, and hoods; aluminum was used for the driveshaft, axles, and wheels. In 1984, the Ford Aerostar name was first used as Ford unveiled a concept vehicle previewing the final production minivan.  Overview  = Chassis = 1987 Ford Aerostar XLT As with its Chrysler and General Motors minivan counterparts, the chassis of the Ford Aerostar derived a number of suspension and powertrain components from existing vehicles to lower development costs. Although it would become the first Ford truck to make use of a unibody chassis, the Aerostar shared most of its components with the Ford Ranger/Bronco II light trucks. To reinforce the chassis for towing and overall rigidity, the dedicated platform (codenamed VN1, the first alphanumeric designation for a Ford platform) was designed with full-length integrated frame rails. The addition provided the Aerostar with the same tow rating as the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, and 2¬Ω times the capacity of the Chrysler minivans. Ford Aerostar rear The front suspension consisted of unequal length A-arms through its entire production; for 1990, the lower A-arm was revised to accommodate the addition of all-wheel drive as an option. The Aerostar differed from all other Ford light trucks in its rear suspension configuration as well. To save space, the live rear axle was fitted with a three-link coil-sprung rear suspension (similar to the Panther-platform cars of the time). During its production run, the Ford Aerostar was the only North American-market minivan sold with four-wheel coil-spring suspension (the planned launch of the Renault Espace by AMC was stillborn). While the planned four-cylinder diesel engine from the 1984 concept vehicle was dropped in the prototype phase, the Aerostar was launched with two engines from the Ranger/Bronco II: a standard 2.3 L four-cylinder (shared with the Mustang) and a carburetor equipped 2.8 L Cologne V6 (from Ford of Europe) for the first few months of production. Shortly after the introduction, the 2.8L V6 was replaced with the newly introduced electronic multi-port fuel injected 3.0 L Vulcan V6 from the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable,5 adding 30 hp. For 1988, the 2.3 L engine was discontinued; the Aerostar became the first minivan powered exclusively by V6 engines. In 1990, coinciding with the introduction of the E4WD Aerostar, a 4.0 L version of the Cologne V6 was introduced; while standard with all-wheel drive versions, it became an option on rear-wheel drive XLT and Eddie Bauer trims as well. Sharing its transmissions with the Ford light-truck line, the Aerostar was available with a five-speed manual until 1995 (nearly exclusively in cargo vans and XL trim); unlike the Chrysler minivans, the Aerostar was sold exclusively with overdrive automatic transmissions. In 1997, the 4.0 L V6 became paired with the first five-speed automatic transmission fitted in a US- market minivan. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible\\" - ! colspan=\\"6\\" - ! Engine name !

Called E-4WD (Electronic 4-Wheel Drive), the system was a permanent four-wheel drive system. Using a Dana TC28 transfer case with a center differential (regulated by an electronically controlled electro-magnetic clutch), all four wheels were given traction at all times. The system shifted traction to the front wheels as it detected rear wheel spin, with no driver input required. As E-4WD was not intended for off- road driving but rather to increase traction in adverse weather conditions, the Aerostar was not provided with specific low-range gearing. To deal with the additional weight and friction losses, the more powerful 4.0-litre V6 engine was standard fitment. Sold from 1990 to 1997, the E-4WD option was available with XLT and Eddie Bauer trims and was paired exclusively with the 4.0L V6 and automatic transmission. = Exterior = 1989‚Äì1991 Aerostar XLT Distinguished by its sloped-nosed design, the Ford Aerostar utilized a \\"one- box\\" design similar to the Renault Espace and the Ford Transit; in contrast to its European counterparts, the Aerostar had much shorter overhangs with the wheels placed at the corners. In an effort to further improve its fuel efficiency and aerodynamics and lower its curb weight, several plastic body parts (bumpers, rear hatch) that were utilized in the 1984 concept car were adopted for production. As a response to the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager, an (unnamed) extended-length version of the Ford Aerostar entered production for 1989. Sharing the 119-inch wheelbase with the standard- length version, the extended-length Aerostar added 14 inches to the rear body. During the 1990s, the extended-length Aerostar would become the most popular version of the vehicle. While the Ford Aerostar would never see a full redesign over its 12-year production run, it would see a number of detail changes to bring it in line with other Ford trucks. For 1988, the nameplate badging was changed, moving it from each fender to the tailgate; it was changed from chrome to silver in color. In 1989, the chrome grille was replaced by a black-trim grille; the bracketed towing mirrors were replaced by integrated powered sideview mirrors. In 1992, an extensive facelift redesigned the grille, bumpers, wheels, and replaced the sealed-beam headlights with replaceable-bulb composite units (the amber turn signal lenses were changed to clear-lens units). As it was becoming a federal requirement, a center brake light was added for 1994. As the Aerostar had been slated for discontinuation after the 1994 model year, few visible changes were made afterwards. For 1997, the amber rear turn signal lenses were deleted; XLT models were given optional 14x6\\" seven-hole alloy wheels. = Interior = In contrast to its radical exterior design, the interior design of the Ford Aerostar adopted many industry-standard features. For example, the seven-passenger Aerostar was configured with the 2-2-3 seating layout popularized in both Chrysler and General Motors minivans. Borrowing features from full-size conversion vans, XLT-trim versions were available with second-row bucket seats; another option allowed both rear bench seats to fold down to make a bed; both rows of rear seats were removable. However, the interior also featured several European- influenced designs: the Aerostar was fitted with a floor-mounted shifter for both automatic and manual transmissions and was equipped with a handbrake (which would become a feature in all US-market Ford minivans); in a fashion similar to the Volkswagen Vanagon, the second-row windows slid open. While cupholders were relegated to an optional armrest in the third-row seats, the Aerostar could be specified with up to six ashtrays and two cigar lighters; the interior may have been designed with a smoker in mind. In 1992, coinciding with the exterior updates, the interior also saw a major upgrade. Along with the addition of a driver's side airbag and three-point seatbelts for all six outboard seats, the dashboard was redesigned with improved controls (many shared with the 1992 Econoline) and a new instrument panel. In 1993, integrated child safety seats were introduced as an option. = Trim = Along with a cargo van (distinguished by its available double rear doors and lack of side windows), the Aerostar passenger van (called the Wagon) came in two trim levels: base-trim XL and deluxe-trim XLT (in keeping with the Ford truck line). Many features standard on the XLT were available as extra-cost options on the XL, such as power windows, mirrors, and locks, air conditioning, and privacy glass. XLT-trim Wagons also included the following features as extra- cost options: * Overhead trip computer with auto-dimming rearview mirror (featuring: Distance to Empty (English/Metric), Trip Mileage, Average Fuel Economy, Instant Fuel Economy, Average Speed (English/Metric), along with dual map lights) * Rear climate control * Second-row Captain's chairs (quad seats) * Fold-flat second and third-row bench seatbacks * 8-speaker AM/FM stereo with cassette player * Premium AM/FM/cassette sound system with 7-band equalizer and rear-seat headphone jacks * Rear-wheel anti-lock brakes * Electronic four-wheel drive (see section) * Two-tone paint * 14\\" aluminum wheels  Eddie Bauer Wagon (1988‚Äì1996)  1989 Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer Introduced during the 1988 model year, the Aerostar was one of the first Ford vehicles to feature the outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer brand as a trim package. Marketed above the XLT, the Aerostar Eddie Bauer was the first minivan marketed towards luxury buyers (for 1988, the Chrysler Town & Country was produced as a compact station wagon, not becoming a minivan until the 1990 model year). The Eddie Bauer trim combined the interior convenience features of the XLT trim with two-tone exterior paint (tan as the accent color on the rocker panels and wheel trim) and a tan outdoors-themed interior. As on the XLT, cloth seating surfaces were standard; as part of the 1992 update, leather seats became an option. A standard feature of the trim package (an option on the XLT) was a feature allowing the second and third row bench seats to fold flat into a large bed across the rear half of the interior. However, a large number of Eddie Bauer Aerostars were ordered with the optional second-row bucket seats/captain's chairs. Following the introduction of the extended-length wagon in 1989, the Eddie Bauer trim was available in both body configurations. After 1989, the option package came with the 4.0L V6 standard, though buyers could choose between rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive powertrains. After the 1996 model year, the Eddie Bauer trim was discontinued as the Aerostar trim line was consolidated to the cargo van and the Aerostar XLT.  Aerostar Sport (1992‚Äì1996)  1992‚Äì1996 Ford Aerostar XL Sport In 1992, the Aerostar Sport was introduced as an option package available for any non-Eddie Bauer Aerostar Wagon. Similar to its Chevrolet Astro RS/GMC Safari CS and Dodge Caravan ES counterparts, the Aerostar Sport was largely a cosmetic upgrade. Distinguished by their silver-accented paint and \\"Sport\\" pinstriping, the Sport featured integrated running boards with a color-matched front air dam and color-matched rear mud flaps. On darker colors, the front grille and chrome was painted body color. The trim version of an Aerostar Sport is most easily identified by its wheels: XL Sport Wagons, with full wheel covers; XLT Sport Wagons (less common), with aluminum wheels.  Concept vehicles  = Ford Aerostar (1984) = The Aerostar name was first revealed as a concept vehicle was shown in 1984, with Ford predicting up to 40 mpg in production versions with four-cylinder diesel engines. With a , the Aerostar was one of the sleekest vehicles designed by Ford, besting the Ford Mustang SVO and the Lincoln Continental Mark VII. Ford engineers chose the front-engine layout for a variety of reasons. In terms of safety and engine access (in comparison to German and Japanese imports), the company found that potential buyers preferred the configuration over rear and mid-engine vehicles. Ford also chose a rear-wheel drive layout for the Aerostar; this provided it with a tow rating, 2¬Ω times the capacity of the Chrysler vans. In the change from concept to production, very little of the exterior design would change, except for the window glass, headlights, and grille. = HFX Aerostar Ghia (1987) = Introduced at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show, the HFX (High Feature Experimental) Aerostar Ghia was a prototype of future minivan design. Two running prototypes were built from the collaboration of Ford and Ghia; both used the stock 3.0L Vulcan V6 and A4LD automatic transmission. The HFX concept borrowed some features used in other Ford vehicles, such as four-wheel air suspension and electronic climate control. From there, some of the technologies showcased in the HFX had never before been seen in a minivan; this included run-flat tires, adjustable pedals, power-sliding side doors, electric power steering, ABS, traction control, seatbelt pretensioners, and movable grille shutters. On the rear, an LCD display was installed for the use of displaying 12 pre-programmed warning messages. Link to HFX Aerostar Ghia images.  Awards  The Aerostar was named Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year for 1990. Discontinuation 1995 Ford Windstar Ford Transit Connect Wagon, current-generation Ford minivan in North America While the Ford Aerostar had proven successful in the minivan segment, by the end of the 1980s, Ford sought to gain a part of the significant market share held by the Chrysler minivans. In 1988, the company commenced design work on a successor to the Aerostar for a planned 1993 introduction. To compete more directly against Chrysler, in its new minivan, Ford adopted the form factor of the long-wheelbase Chrysler minivans. To further match Chrysler, what was to become the 1995 Ford Windstar adopted front-wheel drive sedan underpinnings, developed alongside the 1996 Ford Taurus. As the Ford Windstar was being readied for a 1995 model-year introduction, 1994 was set to be the final year for the Aerostar. In a fashion similar to the planned replacement of the Fox- platform Ford Mustang with a Mazda-based coupe in the late 1980s, Ford received a negative reaction from its dealers and the public. In response, Ford announced it would sell both the Aerostar and Windstar vans for the upcoming future. On March 17, 1997, Ford announced the discontinuation of the Ford Aerostar, alongside the Ford Aspire, Ford Probe, and Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar. The final vehicle rolled off the St. Louis assembly line on August 22, 1997; a total of 2,029,577 were produced over 12 years. Alongside the production of the Ford Windstar, a primary factor leading to the cancellation of the Ford Aerostar was an impending requirement for the addition of dual airbags, which would have required a complete (and costly) redesign of the front dashboard and front crash structure. The Ford Windstar (and later Ford Freestar) was offered in a cargo van configuration, but the first direct successor to the Aerostar Van, in terms of size and capability, is the Ford Transit Connect. Imported into North America since 2010, the front-wheel drive Transit Connect is also offered in passenger configurations; a 2014 redesign led to the first seven-seat Ford minivan since 2007.

Named after a village on the Norfolk coast near Boulton & Paul's factory in Norwich, the Sidestrand first flew in 1926 and entered service in 1928. It remained in service until 1936, equipping No. 101 Squadron RAF. It was an agile and relatively fast aircraft that was capable of aerobatic manoeuvres such as loops, rolls and spins.Taylor 1969, p. 325. Design and development Boulton & Paul Ltd of Norwich built a series of twin-engined biplanes starting with the Bourges of 1918, which although not ordered into production, had demonstrated excellent performance and manoeuvrability, followed by the all-metal Bolton of 1922 and the smaller Bugle of 1923. In 1924, the Air Ministry issued Specification 9/24 for an all- metal, twin engined medium bomber, with an order for two prototypes following early in 1925.Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly November 1994, pp. 19‚Äì20.Mason 1994, p. 180. The first aircraft flew in 1926, piloted by C. A. Rea, Boulton & Paul's first full-time test pilot.\\"Bobolink to Delta, Part III.\\" Flight, 8 July 1955, p. 51. The village of Sidestrand, chosen for the aircraft name, was the home of the Secretary of State for Air, Samuel HoareBrew 1993 Only 20 Sidestrands were built, the first two being equivalent prototypes, were called the Sidestrand Mk I. Originally intended to be powered by two Napier Lion inline engines, the Mk I was eventually fitted with 425 hp (317 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI radial engines, which also powered the first six production Sidestrands, known as the Sidestrand Mk II. The remaining twelve aircraft were powered by 460 hp (343 kW) Jupiter VIIFs as the Sidestrand Mk III. The six Mk IIs were re-engined to bring them up to the Mk III specification. The Sidestrand had three open gun positions; nose, dorsal and ventral. There was usually a crew of three; pilot, nose gunner and a gunner for the dorsal or ventral positions, the choice depending on where each aircraft flew in a formation. Armament for each position was a .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun, the gun being moved between the two rear positions as required.Flight 1969 The Sidestrand bomb-load was limited to , less than contemporaries such as the Tupolev TB-1.Taylor 1980, p. 344. Operational history Deliveries to the re-formed No. 101 Squadron at Bircham Newton began in 1928, the first batch of six aircraft being the Sidestrand Mk II with un-geared Bristol Jupiter VI engines. These were followed by nine Sidestrand Mk III variants with geared Jupiter VIII Fs and the final three production aircraft were replacement Mk IIs. The squadron moved to RAF Andover in 1929. The Sidestrand inherited the good manoeuvrability of the Boulton Paul P. 7 Bourges, but despite proving to be an excellent aircraft for bombing and gunnery, only No. 101 Squadron was so equipped. In the early 1930s a Sidestrand Mk III was fitted with Bristol Pegasus IM3 engines. This was intended to become the Sidestrand Mk IV, but eventually became the prototype for the redeveloped Boulton Paul Overstrand which would begin replacing the Sidestrand in service in 1936. Four Sidestrands were eventually converted to Overstrand standard and are essentially considered Overstrands.

It is a popular tourist destination. Description The island is long and across. It rises steeply to elevations of up to 250 m from a rocky coastline with raised pebble beaches. It has volcanic origins, with about half the land surface covered by a permanent, crevassed icecap. Ice-free areas have a sparse vegetation of mosses and lichens. The bedrock of the island is granodiorite, History The island was discovered by a German expedition of 1873‚Äì74, who named it after geographer August Petermann. The French Antarctic Expedition of 1908-10 wintered over aboard ship in a cove on the southeast side of the island, named Port Circumcision because it was spotted 1 January 1909, the traditional day for the Feast of the Circumcision. Huts built by the expedition are gone, although a cairn remains, along with a refuge hut built by Argentina in 1955, and a cross commemorating three members of the British Antarctic Survey who died in a 1982 attempt to cross the sea ice from Petermann to Faraday Station.  Geography  Ad√©lie penguin rookery on Petermann Island; their droppings make the grey rock pinkish A large number of locations on the island have been individually charted and named. Unless otherwise specified, the following features were first charted by the French Antarctic Expedition during their winter on the island, and named by Captain Jean-Baptiste Charcot. Rouch Point forms the northwest end of Petermann Island. It was named for Jules Rouch, the expedition's oceanographer. Godfroy Point marks the northern extremity of the island. It was named by Captain Charcot for Rene Godfroy, sub-lieutenant on the Pourquoi-Pas. Liouville Point marks the northeast end of the island. It was named for J. Liouville, the expedition's zoologist. Depeaux Point forms the south end of the island. Port Circumcision is a cove indenting the southeast side of Petermann Island. It was discovered on January 1, 1909. In the Roman Catholic calendar, this date is the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, for which Captain Charcot named the cove. The cove served as a base for the Pourquoi-Pas during the 1909 winter season. Also on the south end of the island is Megalestris Hill, a rocky hill approximately high. It was named Megalestris after an obsolete generic name for the south polar skua, which are found on the island. A cairn with a lead plaque was erected on the hill in 1909. The original plaque has since been removed to the Museum National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle in Paris, but the cairn, with a replica plaque, has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 27), following a proposal by Argentina, France and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. = Important Bird Area = Penguin colonies, cruise ship and tourists The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding colony of about 3,000 pairs of gentoo penguins. Other birds nesting at the site in smaller numbers include Ad√©lie penguins, imperial shags, Wilson's storm petrels and south polar skuas. =Groussac Refuge= Groussac Refuge () is an Argentine naval refuge (originally called Hippolyte Bouchard) in Antarctica, located on the southern coast of the Port Circumcision, on Petermann Island, next to the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. The refuge was inaugurated on February 6, 1955 and is operated by the Argentine Navy and was occupied periodically by personnel of the British Antarctic Survey of the former Faraday Station. The refuge take place in the middle of a colony of Gentoo penguin. Its current name is in honour of Paul Groussac, a French writer and historian who lived in Argentina, author of a plea on the Argentine claim of the Malvinas Islands and biographies of Argentine national heroes.

He also wrote a number of works on Mahayana Buddhism and in his day was the best-known British convert to Buddhism. In 1924 he founded what became the London Buddhist Society, which was to have a seminal influence on the growth of the Buddhist tradition in Britain. His former home in St John's Wood, London, is now a Buddhist temple. He was also an enthusiastic proponent of the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship. Family and early career Humphreys was born in Ealing, Middlesex, the son of Travers Humphreys, himself a noted barrister and judge. His given name \\"Christmas\\" is unusual, but, along with \\"Travers\\", had a long history in the Humphreys family. Among friends and family he was generally known as 'Toby'. The death of his elder brother shocked Humphreys into reflection about his beliefs and at age 17 he found himself drawn to Buddhism. He attended Malvern College, where he first became a theosophist and later a convert to Buddhism, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge; he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1924. The same year, Humphreys founded the London Buddhist Lodge, which later changed its name to the Buddhist Society. The impetus for founding the Lodge came from theosophists with whom Humphreys socialised. Both at his home and at the lodge, he played host for eminent spiritual authors such as Nicholas Roerich and Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, and for prominent Theosophists like Alice Bailey and far Eastern Buddhist authorities like D.T. Suzuki. Other regular visitors in the 1930s were the Russian singer Vladimir Rosing and the young philosopher Alan Watts,Watts, Alan, In My Own Way: an autobiography, pg. 79‚Äì80., Novato: New World Library (2007) and in 1931 Humphreys met the spiritual teacher Meher Baba.Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher. 4. Myrtle Beach: Manifestation, Inc. p. 1432. The Buddhist Society of London is one of the oldest Buddhist organisations outside Asia. In 1945, Humphreys drafted the Twelve Principles of Buddhism for which he obtained the approval of all the Buddhist sects in Japan (including the Shin Sect which was not associated with Olcott's common platform) of the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and leading Buddhists of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, China and Tibet. Legal work When he had first qualified, Humphreys tended to take criminal defence work which allowed his skills in cross-examination to be used. In 1934, he was appointed as Junior Treasury Counsel at the Central Criminal Court (more commonly known as \\"the Old Bailey\\"). This job, known unofficially as the \\"Treasury devil\\", involved leading many prosecutions. Humphreys became Recorder of Deal in 1942, a part-time judicial post. In the aftermath of World War II, Humphreys was an assistant prosecutor in the War Crimes trials held in Tokyo. In 1950 he became Senior Treasury Counsel. It was at this time that he led for the Crown in some of the causes c√©l√®bre of the era, including the cases of Craig & Bentley and Ruth Ellis. It was Humphreys who secured the conviction of Timothy Evans for a murder later found to have been carried out by John Christie. All three cases played a part in the later abolition of capital punishment in the United Kingdom. Also in 1950 at the trial of the nuclear spy Klaus Fuchs, Humphreys was the prosecuting counsel for the Attorney General.: The World's Greatest Spies and Spymasters by Roger Boar and Nigel Blundell, 1984 In 1955, he was made a Bencher of his Inn and the next year became Recorder of Guildford. Judge In 1962 Humphreys became a Commissioner at the Old Bailey. He became an Additional Judge there in 1968 and served on the bench until his retirement in 1976. Increasingly he became willing to court controversy by his judicial pronouncements. In 1975, he passed a six-month suspended jail sentence on an 18-year-old man convicted of raping two women at knife-point. The leniency of the sentence created a public outcry. His sentence of a man to eighteen months in jail for a fraud shortly afterwards added to the controversy.Damien P. Horigan, \\"Christmas Humphreys: A Buddhist Judge in Twentieth Century London\\", Korean Journal of Comparative Law, vol. 24., p. 1-16. The Lord Chancellor defended Humphreys in the face of a House of Commons motion to dismiss him, and he also received support from the National Association of Probation Officers. However, he had pressure put on him to resign, which he did some six months after the controversy. Literary career Humphreys was a prolific author of books on the Buddhist tradition. He was also president of the Shakespeare Fellowship, a position to which he was elected in 1955. The Fellowship advanced the theory that the plays generally attributed to Shakespeare were in fact the work of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Under Humphreys the fellowship changed its name to the Shakespeare Authorship Society. In 1962 Humphreys was appointed Vice- President of the Tibet Society, and made Joint Vice-Chairman of the Royal India, Pakistan and Ceylon Society. He published his autobiography Both Sides of the Circle in 1978. He also wrote poetry, especially verses inspired by his Buddhist beliefs, one of which posed the question: When I die, who dies? He died at his London home, 58 Marlborough Place, St John's Wood.

It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it lives on hills and ridges in rocky desert habitat.Anthocharis cethura. Butterflies and Moths of North America. The male and female look similar. The wingspan is between . The wings are yellow with an orange patch toward the front of the forewing outlined in black and white. The edges of the wings are spotted with black. The underside of the hindwing has greenish bands. The adults appear early in the spring. Males congregate in the midday sun to wait for females to emerge, and are more easily observed than females, which are active later in the day. The flight pattern is quick and erratic. The female lays eggs singly on host plants. The conical eggs are blue green when fresh, then turn orange. During early stages the caterpillar is green with a purple stripe outlined in white. In its last instar it is white with mottled markings. The larvae feed mostly on plants of the mustard family. They have been noted on lyreleaf jewelflower (Streptanthus carinatus), London rocket (Sisymbrium irio), western tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), sand fringepod (Thysanocarpus curvipes), and California mustard (Guillenia lasiophylla).

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention center in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage. The book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. National Book Award for Young People's Literature and the 1999 Newbery Medal for the year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal. Holes was adapted by Walt Disney Pictures as a feature film of the same name released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake. A sequel to Holes entitled Small Steps was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit. Plot Stanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame Stanley's \\"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\\". Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is wrongfully convicted of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to the famous baseball player Clyde \\"Sweet Feet\\" Livingston, who donated the shoes for a charity auction. He is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility which is ironically located in the middle of a desert; the lake dried up decades ago and is crawling with highly venomous yellow-spotted lizards, whose bites are always lethal. The inmates are assigned to dig one cylindrical hole each day, five feet wide and five feet deep, which the Warden claims \\"builds their character\\". The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines. = Elya Yelnats = Stanley's Latvian great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, is in love with Myra, the most beautiful girl in the village. However, he faces competition from the local pig farmer Igor Barkov, who is offering Myra's father Morris his fattest pig in exchange for her hand in marriage. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni, an old Egyptian fortune teller with a missing foot, for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner for Elya due to her lack of intelligence, Zeroni takes pity on Elya and gives him a tiny piglet, instructing him to carry it up a mountain every day and let it drink from a stream while singing a special song to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain and sing to her. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed. Elya follows her directions and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor's. However, after realizing Madame Zeroni was right about Myra's lack of intelligence when she's unable to choose between him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and decides to move to America, but forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love with and marries the kind and intelligent Sarah Miller, he becomes beset by bad luck. Elya tells Sarah about the curse and tells her to leave him. Sarah refuses to leave Elya and the song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants. = Kissin' Kate Barlow = In the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion farmer, while rejecting advances from the wealthy Charles \\"Trout\\" Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt to escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \\"rescued\\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again. Three days later, Katherine kills the town sheriff as revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \\"Kissin' Kate Barlow\\", nicknamed so for her calling card of leaving a red lipstick kiss on the cheeks of the men she kills. For the next twenty years, she robs multiple banks across the state of Texas. Among her victims is Stanley's great- grandfather, who she leaves stranded in the desert; he survives after finding refuge on \\"God's thumb\\". She returns to the ruins of Green Lake and is found by a now-destitute Trout Walker and his wife Linda, one of Katherine's former students who married Trout for his money. They try to force her to reveal where she buried the money she'd stolen, but she refuses, telling them they and their descendants can spend the rest of their lives digging in the desert and never find her loot. She is then bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. As she succumbs to its venom, Katherine laughs and tells them to start digging. = Camp Green Lake = The Warden allows the inmates the rest of their day off if they find anything \\"interesting\\". Stanley begins to suspect the Warden is looking for something. During one dig, he finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes. He gives it to X-Ray, the ringleader of his group, who pretends to find it the next day. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to enlarge X-Ray's hole. Stanley later befriends Zero, a camper who quietly keeps to himself, and teaches Zero to read in return for Zero digging part of Stanley's holes. This leads to an argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their records of Zero, whose full name is Hector Zeroni, and let him die in the desert. A few days later, Stanley escapes the camp to look for Hector and finds him taking refuge under the remains of Sam's boat, subsisting on preserved jars of Kate Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \\"Sploosh\\". Hector refuses to go back to the camp. Stanley then notices a mountain in the distance that resembles a thumbs up sign, and recalls his great-grandfather claimed to find \\"refuge on God's thumb\\" after being stranded in the desert by Kate Barlow. They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Hector, breaking the family curse. Hector then reveals that he was the one who stole Clyde Livingston's shoes. Wondering if their meeting was destiny, Stanley asks Hector if he wants to help him dig one last hole. They return to camp and dig in the hole where Stanley first found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and the staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Hector due to the onions they consumed. The Warden is revealed to be Trout Walker's granddaughter and she's been using the camp and the inmates to find Kate Barlow's stolen treasure. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Hector reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Hector if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Hector can come along. The attorney asks for Hector's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Hector is also released. Stanley and Hector then say goodbye to the other campers, and as they drive away, the drought in Green Lake comes to an end. The suitcase contains financial documents that are worth close to two million dollars, which is split evenly between Stanley and Hector. Stanley's family buys a new house and Hector hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father also makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions, and named \\"Sploosh\\", which is endorsed by Clyde Livingston. Meanwhile, Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp. Characters =Camp Green Lake= *Stanley Yelnats IV (also known as \\"Caveman\\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him impudent. As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.Sachar, Louis (1998). \\"Holes\\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015. *Zero (Hector Zeroni): Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \\"stupid\\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great- grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top. *X-Ray (Rex Washburn): X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being pig Latin of his actual name, Rex. *Squid (Alan): Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions. However, he does have a sensitive side to him, as Stanley wakes to hear him crying one night, and Alan asks Stanley to write to his (Alan's) mother when Stanley leaves Camp Green Lake. *Magnet (Jos√©): Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \\"little magnets\\". *Armpit (Theodore Johnson): One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting. *ZigZag (Ricky): Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologize for doing so. Zigzag suffers from paranoia, highlighting his displayed \\"craziness\\". * Twitch (Brian): A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley. *The Warden (Ms. Walker): Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \\"Trout\\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success. *Mr. Sir (Marion Sevilla): One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough. *Mr. Pendanski: In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel. =Town of Green Lake= * Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow): Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow-spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow. *Sam: Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \\"Trout\\" Walker. *Charles \\"Trout\\" Walker: Charles \\"Trout\\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. *Stanley Yelnats I: Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field. =Mid-1800s Latvia= *Elya Yelnats: Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \\"no-good- dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life. He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia. *Madame Zeroni: Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \\"curse\\" on the Yelnats family. *Myra Menke: Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions. *Igor Barkov: Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer. =Minor characters= *Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III): Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake. *Mrs. Yelnats: Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have. *Barf Bag (Louis): An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized. Setting Camp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the U.S. state of Texas. The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is the scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \\"the Warden owns the shade.\\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.  Themes  = Fairy tales = The themes typical of a folk or fairy tale are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives. Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse. Stanley's bad luck is blamed on the curse left on his great-great-grandfather and the Yelnats family easily believes in the power of this curse. Both Stanley and Elya are similar to fairy tale characters and are morally good, heroic protagonists who must overcome the challenges predestined for them. Both story lines are accompanied by a magic that is seen in the mountain stream, Madame Zeroni's song, and the healing power of the onions. Each of these elements in Holes mirror elements frequently found in fairy tales. = Names = Throughout the novel, names act as a theme that allows the characters to disassociate their lives at Camp Green Lake from their lives back in the real world. Names also demonstrate irony‚ÄîCamp Green Lake is not actually a camp, it's located in a desert, and there is no lake. The \\"campers\\" all label themselves differently and identify with names such as Armpit and X-Ray and the guards are referred to as counselors. One of the counselors is referred to by the boys as \\"Mom\\", representing the absent parents at Camp Green Lake. Only the woman in charge is referred to in a prison-like way and is called \\"Warden\\". The different names allow the boys to bond and form a team based in their hatred for their work and the counselors. Many of the characters also have names that connect them to their family history, like the passing down of \\"Stanley Yelnats\\" and Zero's last name of Zeroni, and remind them how the actions of their ancestors affect their modern-day lives. Stanley is the fourth \\"Stanley Yelnats\\" in his family, a name that is passed down due to its palindromic nature and adds to the connection to family history. =Labor= Labor is seen throughout the novel as the children are forced to dig holes while at Camp Green Lake. This theme is unusual in children's literature as many authors portray children as carefree and without responsibility. If they do engage in work, it is synonymous with play. Critic Maria Nikolajeva contends that Holes is set apart through the not just manual, but forced labor Stanley and the other campers do daily.

Betsy Hearne of The New York Times applauded the novel's integration of mystery and humor that manages to keep Holes light and fresh, and she characterizes it as a \\"family read-aloud.\\" Roger Sutton of The Horn Book Magazine called Sachar's declarative style effective, and argues that it helped make the novel more poignant. Sutton appreciated the positive ending and the suspense that leads the reader to it.

At the age of fourteen, he became a disciple of Dayun Temple (Â§ß‰∫ëÂØ∫). At twenty he travelled to Chang'an for study and returned six years later, eventually becoming abbot of Daming Temple. Besides his learning in the Tripi·π≠aka, Jianzhen is also said to have been expert in medicine. He opened the Buddhist temple as a place of healing, creating the Beitian Court (ÊÇ≤Áî∞Èô¢)a hospital within Daming Temple.

Despite protests from his disciples, Jianzhen made preparations and in spring 743 was ready for the long voyage across the East China Sea to Japan. The crossing failed and in the following years, Jianzhen made three more attempts but was thwarted by unfavourable conditions or government intervention. In summer 748, Jianzhen made his fifth attempt to reach Japan. Leaving from Yangzhou, he made it to the Zhoushan Archipelago off the coast of modern Zhejiang. But the ship was blown off course and ended up in the Yande (Âª∂Âæ∑) commandery on Hainan Island. Jianzhen was then forced to make his way back to Yangzhou by land, lecturing at a number of monasteries on the way. Jianzhen travelled along the Gan River to Jiujiang, and then down the Yangtze River. The entire failed enterprise took him close to three years. By the time Jianzhen returned to Yangzhou, he was blind from an infection. Golden Hall of T≈çsh≈çdai-ji in Nara, Japan (World Heritage Site). In the autumn of 753, the blind Jianzhen decided to join a Japanese emissary ship returning to its home country. After an eventful sea journey of several months, the group finally landed at Kagoshima, Ky≈´sh≈´, on December 20. They reached Nara in the spring of the next year and were welcomed by the Emperor. At Nara, Jianzhen presided over T≈çdai-ji. The Chinese monks who travelled with him introduced Chinese religious sculpture to the Japanese. In 755, the first ordination platform in Japan was constructed at T≈çdai-ji, on the place where including former Emperor Sh≈çmu and Empress K≈çmy≈ç received ordination by Jianzhen a year earlier. In 759 he retired to a piece of land granted to him by the imperial court in the western part of Nara. There he founded a school and also set up a private temple, T≈çsh≈çdai-ji. In the ten years until his death in Japan, Jianzhen not only propagated the Buddhist faith among the aristocracy, but also served as an important conductor of Chinese culture. Jianzhen died on the 6th day of the 5th month of 763. A dry-lacquer statue of him made shortly after his death can still be seen at T≈çsh≈çdai-ji.The statue is made public only during a limited number of days around the anniversary of Jianzhen's death (see it on the right). (Planned June 2nd - 10th for year 2007.) Recognised as one of the greatest of its type, it has been postulated by statue restoration experts that the statue incorporates linen clothing originally worn by Ganjin.NHK World, Mysteries of Ganjin's Statue, 11/2/13. The statue was temporarily brought to Jianzhen's original temple in Yangzhou in 1980 as part of a friendship exchange between Japan and China. Jianzhen is credited with the introduction of the Ritsu school of Buddhism to Japan, which focused on the vinaya, or Buddhist monastic rules. In May 2010, the Taiwanese Buddhist organization Tzu Chi organized and produced an animated drama on Jianzhen's life and journey to Japan.

His paintings are held in a number of important Australian public art collections. He was the eldest son of George Fife Angas, who was prominent in the early days of the colonisation of South Australia. Biography He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the eldest son of George Fife Angas, prominent in the establishment of the new colony of South Australia. Despite showing remarkable talent in drawing, he was placed in a London business house by his father. He left on a tour of Europe and in 1842 published his first book, \\"Rambles in Malta and Sicily\\". As a result of this experience, he turned his back on the world of commerce, and directed his training towards a study of natural history, anatomical drawing and lithography. Embarking on his travels, he was soon to find his acquired skills extremely useful. Angas painted some of the earliest views of South Australia. Arriving in Adelaide in January 1844, he joined Sir George Grey on an expedition into the interior. He soon began an extensive series of journeys to the Murray River lakes, Barossa Valley, Fleurieu Peninsula and the South East, presenting his impressions of the newly established colony ‚Äì its inhabitants, landscape, and its flora and fauna. Following a trip to New Zealand he returned to South Australia in 1845 and travelled to Port Lincoln. In the following year he returned for a short while to England, accompanied by a young MƒÅori man, Hemi Pomara, who was exhibited alongside Angas's paintings at the Egyptian Hall in London. Angas' next journey in 1846 was to South Africa, where he spent two years in Natal and the Cape, working on a series of drawings and watercolours which were published in 1849 as The Kafirs Illustrated. In this book were views of Cape Town, Durban, Wynberg, Genadendal, Paarl and Somerset West, and plates depicting the local ethnic groups such as the Khoikhoi (then referred to as Hottentots), Cape Malays and Zulus. Angas married Alicia Mary Moran in 1849, the marriage producing four daughters. In 1853 Angas was appointed to a position at the Australian Museum in Sydney, eventually becoming Director and staying a total of seven years. Angas was in Sydney when gold was first discovered near Bathurst, New South Wales. Travelling there to record the gold diggings he executed a number of drawings of the scenes that he found. These were published in Sydney and subsequently in London. Angas was represented at the 1855 Paris exposition with five other Australian artists including Conrad Martens, Frederick Terry and Adelaide Ironside, the first time Australian artists had been represented at a major overseas display.Merle Peters, 'Terry, Frederick Casemero (1825‚Äì1869)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, MUP, 1976, pp 256‚Äì257. Angas returned to South Australia in 1860, and finally went back to England in 1863. Angas published several books on Australia and Polynesia as well as illustrating accounts of exploration by John McDouall Stuart and John Forrest, and contributed significantly to conchology with his descriptions and illustrations.Angas, George French. 1864.

The State Library of New South Wales has four letters written by Angas ‚Äì the first is addressed to his publisher, Joseph Hogarth, and is dated 31 January 1848, requesting that two drawings be released to the lithographer James William Giles (1801‚Äì1870), and for an advance in payment. The second, dated 28 July 1849 discusses problems experienced by overseas subscribers in the delivery of Kafirs Illustrated. The third letter instructs the publisher to send a plate from his sister's copy of Kafirs to the bookbinder, Mr Proudfoot, in George Street.

A substantial portion of the company's shows air on NBC, making the company its de facto television production division. It was formerly known as Revue Studios, Universal-International Television, MCA/Universal, NBC Productions, NBC Studios, Studios USA Television LLC, Universal Network Television, Universal Domestic Television, USA Cable Entertainment, NBC Universal Television Studio, and Universal Media Studios. re-established in 2004, Both NBC Studios and the original Universal Network Television are predecessors of Universal Media Studios, formerly known as NBC Universal Television Studio. Background =Revue Studios= Revue Productions (later known as Revue Studios) was founded in 1943 by MCA to produce live radio shows and also produced \\"Stage Door Canteen\\" live events for the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II. Revue was re-launched as MCA's television production subsidiary in 1950. The partnership of NBC and Revue extends as far back as September 6, 1950, with the television broadcast of Armour Theatre, based on radio's Stars Over Hollywood. MCA bought the Universal Studios lot in 1958 and was renamed Revue Studios. Following its merger with Decca Records, the then-parent of Universal Pictures, the studio backlot name was changed back to Universal. In 1963, MCA formed Universal City Studios to merge the Motion Picture and Television arms of both Universal Pictures and Revue Studios and Revue was officially renamed Universal Television in 1963. During the early years of television, Revue was responsible for producing and/or distributing many television programs. The most noteworthy included Leave It to Beaver, which ran for only one season on CBS before going to ABC from 1958 until 1963. In addition, Revue also made Alan Hale, Jr.'s Biff Baker, U.S.A. (1952‚Äì1953) and all three of Rod Cameron's syndicated series, City Detective (1953‚Äì1955), State Trooper (1956‚Äì1959), and Coronado 9 (1960‚Äì1961) and the Bill Williams western series, The Adventures of Kit Carson (1951‚Äì1955). It produced Bachelor Father (1957‚Äì1962), for \\"Bachelor Productions\\", Edmond O'Brien's syndicated crime drama Johnny Midnight, based on a fictitious New York City actor-turned-private detective. Another of its offerings was the 52-episode Crusader, the first Brian Keith series, which ran on CBS 1955‚Äì1956. Another western produced by Revue and starring Audie Murphy was Whispering Smith (NBC, 1959/61), based on the 1948 Alan Ladd movie of the same name. Leave It to Beaver was produced first by George Gobel's Golmaco Productions, then by Kayro Productions on a back lot at Revue Studios from 1958 to 1963. Also McHale's Navy was produced by Revue from 1962 to 1966. In December 1958 MCA/Revue purchased Universal Studios's 367 acre backlot to produce television series, then leased it back to Universal for a million dollars a year for a decade.pp. 16‚Äì17 Green, Paul & Price, Frank, A History of Television's the Virginian, 1962‚Äì1971. McFarland, 30/05/2010 Revue also produced later seasons of The Jack Benny Program for CBS and NBC and in co- operation with Jack Benny's J and M productions Checkmate, General Electric Theater and Alfred Hitchcock Presents for CBS, Studio 57 for DuMont, and westerns such as Tales of Wells Fargo, The Restless Gun and Laramie for NBC, as well as Wagon Train for NBC and ABC, and the first two seasons of NBC's The Virginian, based on a film released originally by Paramount Pictures, whose pre-1950 theatrical sound feature film library was sold to MCA in 1957. Wagon Train was the only Revue-produced TV show ever to finish an American television season in first place. =NBC Productions/NBC Studios= NBC Productions was founded in 1947 by RCA (NBC's former parent company). In 1996, the company was renamed NBC Studios. In 2004, NBC Studios was merged with Universal Network Television to form NBC Universal Television Studios. In 1995, NBC launched a partnership with television director James Burrows to create 3 Sisters Entertainment, who produced series for the network. Out of these five, the most successful out of the venture were Will & Grace and Caroline in the City (co-produced and owned by CBS Productions). =MCA Television= MCA TV (also known as MCA Television Enterprises) was founded in 1951, several years before parent MCA's purchase of American Decca (in 1959) and Universal Pictures (in 1962). For more than four decades, it was one of the most active syndicators of television programming. During the 1980s, it distributed both off-network reruns of shows like Kate & Allie and Gimme a Break!, as well as original syndication product like the animated action series Bionic Six (co-produced with TMS Entertainment), The Morton Downey Jr. Show (taped at then-MCA owned WWOR-TV in Secaucus, NJ), The Munsters Today (a revival of the Universal sitcom), and Pictionary, based on the popular board game. MCA Television attempted several branded TV packages in 1985 to 2001 including an ad-hoc film network, a broadcast network and a few syndicated programming blocks. The company launched the Universal Pictures Debut Network, an ad-hoc film network with plans to launch in two stages beginning in September 1985. MCA TV and Paramount Domestic Television had formed Premier Advertiser Sales, a joint venture created for the sale of advertising for their existing syndicated programs in September 1989. As a possible outgrowth of this sales joint venture, MCA and Paramount began plans for a new network, Premier Program Service. When Premier Program Service halted, MCA teamed up with Chris-Craft TV for a syndicated programming block, Hollywood Premiere Network, that only lasted for the 1990-1991 season. The Universal Family Network syndicated programming block was launched by the company in the fall of 1993 with a single weekly half hour show, Exosquad, as a counter to The Disney Afternoon. In 1996, MCA TV was renamed Universal Television Enterprises; at this time they also assumed production and distribution of several daytime talk shows previously produced by Multimedia Entertainment (which Universal had acquired), including The Jerry Springer Show. MTE (known as MCA Television Entertainment) was formed in 1987. It primarily dealt with made-for-TV movies and series like Dream On that were made for cable networks like HBO. Like MCA TV, in 1996, it was renamed as Universal Television Entertainment. EMKA, Ltd. is the holding company responsible for a majority of the pre-1950 Paramount Pictures sound library. As an official part of the Universal Pictures library, they are part of the company's television unit, Universal Television. =Universal Television= The first incarnation of Universal Television was reincorporated from Revue Productions in 1966, 4 years after MCA bought Universal Pictures and its then-current parent Decca Records. Among their many contributions to television programming included production of the first motion picture made exclusively for television (See How They Run from 1964), the first series with revolving stars (Name of the Game from 1968), the first rotating series with an umbrella title (1969's The Bold Ones) and the first two-part television movie (Vanished from 1971). Uni TV (also commonly known as MCA/Universal) also co-produced many shows with Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited such as Emergency!, Adam-12 and a revival of the 1951 series Dragnet. During the 1970s and 1980s, Uni TV produced shows such as Baretta, The Rockford Files, Murder, She Wrote, Miami Vice, The Incredible Hulk, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series), Knight Rider, The A-Team, Simon & Simon and Magnum, P.I., which received critical acclaim and several TV movie spin-offs after their cancellations. In 1990, MCA/Uni TV began the Law & Order franchise. In 1996, MCA was reincorporated as Universal Studios. Around the same time, Universal was acquired by Joseph A. Seagram and Sons and later acquired the Multimedia Entertainment and USA Networks. Universal purchased a 50% stake of Brillstein- Grey Entertainment in 1996 for $75 to $100 million. They considered buying the other 50% after selling its own TV unit to Barry Diller in 1998. Universal sold its stake in BGE in 1999 and BGE was renamed as Brad Grey Television, Universal continued to co-produce Just Shoot Me! and The Steve Harvey Show until their cancellations. =Studios USA= USA Networks Inc. was formed by Barry Diller when he bought Universal's major television assets in October 1997. Among its assets were the USA Network and Sci-Fi cable channels along with series such as Law & Order. Additionally, the company would own the Home Shopping Network, the Ticketmaster Group and several TV stations. Universal TV's production and distribution unit was renamed Studios USA. Universal held on to its 50% share of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, PolyGram Television's international channels and the rights to its TV library while signing a long- term domestic sales deal with Studios USA for the library. Universal got a 45% share in USA Networks Inc. Greg Meidel initially resigned and was rehired as chairman and CEO of Studios USA, only to leave in June 1998. In 1999, USA Networks formed its own film and home media divisions when they acquired October Films and several production and distribution assets of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment for $200 million. In 2001, Vivendi Universal acquired USA's entertainment assets for an estimated $10.3 billion. Under the deal, Barry Diller became chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment. USA Networks is currently known as IAC InterActiveCorp. =PolyGram Television/Universal Worldwide Television= In 1997, PolyGram created a television division to distribute first-run syndicated and network series, hiring Bob Sanitsky from International Creative Management to be president of the division. The new unit absorbed the domestic syndication unit of ITC Entertainment (acquired by PolyGram in 1995), including it's domestic sales president Matt Cooperstein. The division's first project was the syndication of new episodes of Alliance Atlantis' Due South, distributing 22 new episodes for primetime or weekend afternoon slots. It was distributed in conjunction with Worldvision Enterprises for ad sales. The unit also syndicated action hour series such as The Crow: Stairway to Heaven (based on the Miramax film with Brandon Lee. Disney, it's then owner at the time had passed on the series) and Total Recall: 2070, as well as the music variety program Motown Live. In early 1999, Shortly after Seagram and Universal completed their deal to acquire PolyGram. PolyGram TV was absorbed into Universal's TV and Networks division (which consisted of Universal's international TV operations). Universal would sell the ITC film and TV library to Carlton Communications, and the pre-1996 film library to MGM. Following this, PolyGram TV was renamed Universal Worldwide Television, and in the fall of that year. UWT launched a successful realty strip, Blind Date (which gained a sister program from the same producers, The 5th Wheel). By 2001, rumours began circulating about the closure of the division (and it's two series would have been sold off to another syndicator). However by October, UWT's head of sales said the closure would not happen. In June 2002, After Vivendi Universal re-acquired the entertainment arm of USA Networks. Universal Worldwide Television was merged with Studios USA Domestic Television to form Universal Television Enterprises. =USA Cable Entertainment= In 2002, Studio USA was renamed to USA Cable Entertainment but it was only used on USA Network shows. History Logo used as NBC Universal Television Studio. NBC Universal Television Studios was formed in 2004 from NBC Studios and Universal Network Television after NBC and Universal merged. On November 5, 2007, NBC Universal Television Studio was renamed Universal Media Studios (UMS) as the unit would be also developing entertainment for the web. On July 21, 2009, Universal Cable Productions was split off from UMS and placed into NBCUniversal's NBCU Cable Entertainment division. On September 14, 2011, Universal Media Studios was renamed to Universal Television. In October 2019, Universal Television was transferred from NBC Entertainment to NBCUniversal Content Studios.

Three sailors from the S.S. Idaho, Skat Briggs, Windy Deegan and Woozy Hoga, ask her to sing at a party they are organizing (\\"Join It Right Away\\"). Nick Bullet, Hattie‚Äôs fiance, is a wealthy Navy officer. They are about to meet his eight-year-old daughter Geraldine (Jerry), off the boat from Philadelphia. He tells Hattie, \\"My Mother Would Love You\\". Hattie, eager to make a good impression on her prospective stepdaughter, spends three weeks' wages on her elaborately frilly outfit. But when she arrives, Jerry makes fun of Hattie's clothing and way of speaking. Feeling that her marriage is off, Hattie gets drunk on rum (\\"I‚Äôve still Got my Health\\"). Kitty-Belle, the daughter of Admiral Whitney Randolph, wants to marry Nick, and she schemes to end his romance with Hattie. Florrie, a singer in the night club, develops a crush on Nick's very proper butler Vivian Budd (\\"Fresh as a Daisy\\"). Nick‚Äôs efforts to persuade Jerry and Hattie to get along with each other finally succeed, with Jerry making the still hungover Hattie cut the bows off her dress and shoes (\\"Let‚Äôs Be Buddies\\"). Jerry gives Hattie advice on how to behave like a lady at a party where she is to be presented to Nick‚Äôs boss, the Admiral (\\"I‚Äôm Throwing a Ball Tonight\\"). Admiral Randolph is to be presented with a cup, and his daughter Kitty-Belle suggests that Hattie might present it filled with goldenrod. This gives Whitney hay fever; Hattie is blamed, and Nick is ordered not to marry Hattie. ;Act II The sailors from the S. S. Idaho uncover a spy plot involving saboteurs. Hattie swears off rum (\\"Make It Another Old Fashioned Please\\"). Hattie has it out with Kitty-Belle, whose boyfriend keeps being called in whenever Hattie is on the verge of hitting her. Meanwhile, Florrie continues to try to attract the romantic attention of Budd (\\"All I‚Äôve Got to Get Now is My Man\\"). Hattie, two of the sailors and Budd meet regarding these various threads (\\"You Said It\\"). Mildred Hunter, Kitty-Belle‚Äôs best friend, turns out to be a terrorist (\\"Who would Have Dreamed\\"). She gives Jerry a secret package to put in Nick‚Äôs desk. Hattie overhears the plot to blow up the Panama Canal control room, finds the bomb and throws it out, saving the day. The grateful Admiral Whitney retracts his order and the sailors praise Hattie (\\"God Bless the Woman\\").

These pioneering computers were marketed to transaction processing customers, who used them for ATMs, banks, stock exchanges, and military applications. Treybig grew up in Bellaire, Texas, and attended Bellaire High School from 1956 to 1959. He then went to Rice University, where he received a B.A. degree in 1963 and a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1964; following that he went to Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he earned an MBA in 1968.James G. Treybig Bloomberg Business Executive Profile Treybig's first job after graduating from Rice was as a salesman for Texas Instruments. After receiving his MBA, he went to work for Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 1968, serving as marketing section manager on the HP 3000 project, the first ever commercial minicomputer with a full featured operating system with time-sharing, released in 1973.HP3000 \\"HP's EARLY COMPUTERS, Part Three: THE STRONGEST CASTLE: The Rise, Fall and Rise of the HP 3000\\" In 1973, he joined Kleiner Perkins venture capital company. In 1974, he founded Tandem Computers, funded in part by Kleiner Perkins. Treybig served as CEO of Tandem Computers from 1974 to 1996. The business plan included detailed ideas for building a corporate culture reflecting Treybig's values, such as paid six week sabbaticals each 4 years for all employees, an annual gift of 100 shares of Tandem stock to all employees, a weekly all- employee party, and a world-wide closed circuit monthly telecast to keep employees informed. Under his leadership, Tandem delivered its first product in 1976, first issued public stock in 1977, and in 1980 was ranked by Inc. magazine as the fastest-growing public company in America.

It was used in the United States from the 1950s through the 1980s. The paper used in this process was coated with a zinc oxide powder, adhered with a resin, to make it able to hold an electrostatic charge, and absorb toner, to form an image and allow the evaporation of toner dispersants. Users of electrofax machines purchased paper with the coating already applied. Copiers typically feed paper from a roll, where it is given a static electric charge, after which it is exposed to light reflected from the original document, and focused through a lens; zinc oxide particles either preserve or discharge the electric charge, depending on the amount of light reaching them. After exposure, the paper is passed through a toner station: toner is typically carbon black suspended in an organic liquid known as a dispersant, then spread over the paper. Black toner particles adhere to areas on the paper that remain charged; discharged areas do not attract toner particles. A knife then cuts the paper to the proper length (typically letter or legal size). The subsequently independent sheet of paper then passes from the toner station, where excess dispersant is wiped off. Typically, the paper is finally sent to an output tray where any remaining dispersant evaporates, leaving copies with a faint \\"kerosene\\" odor. In printers and plotters, paper is typically electrostatically charged by passing it over a bar containing hundreds or thousands of charging contacts. As paper passes over it, an image is formed by either applying or removing a charge from each individual contact. The result is a grid of charged dots on the paper. Toner is then applied as described above. In the early 1950s, this technology was first developed at RCA (Radio Corporation of America). Subsequently, many office machine companies, including SCM (Smith Corona Marchant), Savin, etc., introduced copiers that utilized this technology. Versatec was a brand of computer printers and plotters using this process; electrostatic printers like the Versatec were important stepping-stones to later laser printers. Programs like vtroff, by Tom Ferrin at UCSF, consequently justified early more expensive laser printers. Copying machines using electrofax technology were common from the 1960s through the 1980s. They were less expensive to manufacture than xerographic copiers, although the paper was slightly more costly than the plain paper used by xerography. Electrofax fell out of favor when other copier technologies could produce markedly better quality copies at less expense. By comparison, electrofax suffered a number of drawbacks, including: weak blacks in the image (most machines could only produce a dark gray), dampness and odor of the copies, the need for special paper, and multiple-bottle liquid toner replacement. Similarly, the need for electrofax based printers & plotters faded, as laser printers became cheaper, followed by inkjet printers.

The monorail opened in 1996, and , is planned to be replaced. History =Initial operations= AirTrain Newark in 2011 View from the front car of the train, 1997 An AirTrain over the P3 parking lot, 2005, with the Anheuser-Busch Newark factory in the background The monorail opened in 1996 and initially served only as an airport circulator, a service which allows passengers to transfer between airport terminals or concourses. The monorail track was refurbished and extended to the NEC, with construction beginning in 1997. The system reopened for service on October 21, 2000. When first opened in 1996 a fleet of 12 six-car Bombardier trains ran on the network. It has expanded to 18 six-car trains. The contract to build the system was awarded to Von Roll AG, but the project was finished by Adtranz, who acquired Von Roll's monorail division while the system was being built. Adtranz was later acquired by Bombardier Transportation, who continues to operate the AirTrain under contract to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the operator of the airport. AirTrain service was suspended from May 1, 2014, for 75 days, until mid-July, to allow repairs. Repairs were completed early, and the service re-opened on July 3. =Replacement= The system has a projected lifespan of 25 years. In April 2015, the PANYNJ suggested that initial work to replace the system would cost $40 million in consultant and engineering studies. In January 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced a plan for a $2 billion replacement project for the Newark AirTrain. Murphy has stated that replacement is necessary because the system is reaching the end of its projected 25-year life and is subject to persistent delays and breakdowns. The Port Authority would be responsible for funding the project. In October 2019, the Port Authority board approved the replacement project with an estimated cost of $2.05 billion. Construction is expected to start in 2021 and be completed in 2024. Fare The train is free, except to and from the Amtrak/New Jersey Transit station. In that case, the fare is included in the price of the train ticket. New Jersey Transit and Amtrak monthly pass holders must pay an extra $7.75 to ride AirTrain, unless they set EWR as the origin or destination stop for their pass. In June 2019, the Port Authority proposed raising AirTrain Newark's fare from $5 to $7.75, which was approved that September. The fare increase took effect that year on November 1, representing the first fare raise in sixteen years. Stations Platform- level interior of P3 station, 2008 The AirTrain has three major stations within the airport, one for each main terminal (A, B, and C). These stations sit on top of the terminal buildings. There are three other stations (P2, P3, and P4) for the parking lots and rental car facilities plus a seventh (RaiLink station) at the Northeast Corridor. Automated announcements recorded by traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast tell riders which airlines can be found in each terminal, as well as connections at other stations. In 2007, the average daily paid ridership was 4,930.

History  Pocket Books produced the first mass-market, pocket-sized paperback books in the United States in early 1939 and revolutionized the publishing industry. The German Albatross Books had pioneered the idea of a line of color-coded paperback editions in 1931 under Kurt Enoch, and Penguin Books in Britain had refined the idea in 1935 and had one million books in print by the following year. Pocket Books was founded by Richard L. Simon, M. Lincoln (\\"Max\\") Schuster and Leon Shimkin, partners of Simon & Schuster, along with Robert de Graff. In 1944, the founding owners sold the company to Marshall Field III, owner of the Chicago Sun newspaper. Following Field's death, in 1957, Leon Shimkin, a Simon & Schuster partner, and James M. Jacobson bought Pocket Books for $5 million. Simon & Schuster acquired Pocket in 1966. Penguin's success inspired entrepreneur Robert de Graff, who partnered with publishers Simon & Schuster to bring it to the American market. Priced at 25 cents and featuring the logo of Gertrude the kangaroo (named after the mother-in-law of the artist, Frank Lieberman), Pocket Books' editorial policy of reprints of light literature, popular non- fiction, and mysteries was coordinated with its strategy of selling books outside the traditional distribution channels. The format size, and the fact that the books were glued rather than stitched, were cost-cutting innovations. The first ten numbered Pocket Book titles published in 1939 with a print run of about 10,000 copies each: # Lost Horizon by James Hilton # Wake Up and Live by Dorothea Brande # Five Great Tragedies by William Shakespeare # Topper by Thorne Smith # The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie # Enough Rope by Dorothy Parker # Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront√´ # The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler # The Bridge of San Luis Rey by Thornton Wilder # Bambi by Felix Salten The edition of Wuthering Heights hit the bestseller list, and by the end of the first year Pocket Books had sold more than 1.5 million units. Robert de Graff continued to refine his selections with movie tie-ins and greater emphasis on mystery novels, particularly those of Christie and Erle Stanley Gardner. Pocket and its imitators thrived during World War II because material shortages worked to their advantage. During the war, Pocket sued Avon Books for copyright infringement: among other issues, a New York state court found Pocket did not have an exclusive right to the pocket-sized format (both Pocket and Avon published paperback editions of Leslie Charteris' The Saint mystery series, among others). Phyllis E. Grann who would later become the first woman CEO of a major publishing firm was promoted to run Pocket Books under then CEO Richard E. Snyder. Grann left for Putnam in 1976. In 1981, Dr. Benjamin Spock's Baby and Child Care was listed as their top seller, having sold 28 million copies at that time and having been acquired in 1946. In 1989, The Dieter by Susan Sussman became the first hard cover published by Pocket Books. Pocket is still known for publishing works of popular fiction based on movies or TV series, such as the Star Trek franchise (owned by corporate sibling CBS Television Studios, while former corporate sibling Paramount Pictures owns film and DVD distribution rights) and formerly Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Since first obtaining the Star Trek license from Bantam Books in 1979 (with a publication of the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture), Pocket has published hundreds of original and adapted works based upon the franchise and continues to publish a new novel every month. The author credited for one of the Buffy products is Gertrude Pocket, a reference to the company's kangaroo logo (The Buffy novels are now published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, another division of Simon & Schuster). Pocket Books is also the division that currently owns publication rights to the well-known work of James O'Barr, The Crow.

It was designed in accordance with a requirement set out in 1994, and is capable of defeating light armor and equipment out to . Prototypes of the XM109 have existed since the late 1990s and studies of the weapon's effectiveness were released in 2002; 10 prototypes were known to exist in 2004, and the XM109 and Barrett XM500 were folded into a broader Anti-Material Rifle Congressional Program in 2006. The current status of the XM109 is not particularly clear, with no news of either cancellation or potential adoption. Overview The XM109, originally known as the Objective Sniper Weapon (OSW) and now called the Anti-Materiel Payload Rifle (AMPR), is a semi-automatic anti-materiel rifle, designed primarily for engagement of light armored vehicles and similar targets. The design uses the lower receiver from an M82/M107, but with a new upper receiver chambered in 25mm. The upper receiver of the M82 rifles can be replaced with an XM109 upper receiver to form a fully functional XM109 rifle. 25 mm rounds for the XM109: XM1050 TP and XM1049 HEDP The 25 √ó 59 mm round that is used in the XM109 is the same one originally developed for the cancelled XM307, product of the Objective (later Advanced) Crew Served Weapon program (OCSW / ACSW). As with the XM307, the XM109 can be reconfigured back to .50 BMG, in the XM109's case this is done by swapping the 25mm upper receiver for a standard M82 / M107 upper. The XM109 offers greater range and a shorter overall length than the previous M82/M107 systems, as well as potentially greater power in the 25 √ó 59 mm cartridge over even the Mk 211 .50 BMG cartridge (AKA \\"Raufoss round\\"). However, the small amount of propellant and heavy projectile resulted in unacceptably high recoil due to limiting the effects of the weapon's muzzle brake, with a recoil force of over 60 foot- pounds compared to 36 for the M107. As of 2004, one of the project goals was to reduce the weapon's recoil.

After high school, Winter attended Memorial University, graduating in 1986 with a BA in economic geography.Smith, S. (2007, July). Change is Good. Quill & Quire Winter's first short story collection, Creaking in Their Skins, was published in 1994. In 1999, editor John Metcalf at The Porcupine's Quill published his second book of stories, One Last Good Look. Winter moved to Toronto in 1999, where he published his first two novels: This All Happened (2000) and The Big Why (2004). Much of Winter's fiction chronicles the life and adventures of his fictional alter ego, Gabriel English. This All Happened, for example, is organized as a fictional diary, with 365 entries describing Gabriel's life in St. John's, his relationship with filmmaker Lydia Murphy, and the progress of the novel he is trying to write.Canadian Encyclopedia The book was nominated for the 2000 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize and won the inaugural Winterset Award. The Big Why was a historical novel narrated by real-life American artist Rockwell Kent describing the time he spent in Brigus, Newfoundland, in 1914. Kent was eventually deported from Newfoundland on suspicion of being a German spy. Winter was one of the judges of the 2006 Giller Prize, and his line drawings illustrate Noah Richler's This is My Country, What's Yours? A Literary Atlas of Canada (2006).

Adams described the Zone System as \\"[...] not an invention of mine; it is a codification of the principles of sensitometry, worked out by Fred Archer and myself at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, around 1939‚Äì40.\\" The technique is based on the late 19th century sensitometry studies of Hurter and Driffield. The Zone System provides photographers with a systematic method of precisely defining the relationship between the way they visualize the photographic subject and the final results. Although it originated with black- and-white sheet film, the Zone System is also applicable to roll film, both black-and-white and color, negative and reversal, and to digital photography.  Principles  = Visualization = An expressive image involves the arrangement and rendering of various scene elements according to the photographer's desire. Achieving the desired image involves image management (placement of the camera, choice of lens, and possibly the use of camera movements) and control of image values. The Zone System is concerned with control of image values, ensuring that light and dark values are rendered as desired. Anticipation of the final result before making the exposure is known as visualization. = Exposure metering = Any scene of photographic interest contains elements of different luminance; consequently, the \\"exposure\\" actually is many different exposures. The exposure time is the same for all elements, but the image illuminance varies with the luminance of each subject element. Exposure is often determined using a reflected-lightAdams (1981, 30) considered the incident-light meter, which measures light falling on the subject, to be of limited usefulness because it takes no account of the specific subject luminances that actually produce the image. exposure meter. The earliest meters measured overall average luminance; meter calibration was established to give satisfactory exposures for typical outdoor scenes. However, if the part of a scene that is metered includes large areas of unusually high or low reflectance, or unusually large areas of highlight or shadow, the \\"effective\\" average reflectance A typical scene includes areas of highlight and shadow, and has scene elements at various angles to the light source, so it usually is possible to use the term \\"average\\" reflectance only loosely. Here, \\"effective\\" average reflectance is used to include these additional effects. may differ substantially from that of a \\"typical\\" scene, and the rendering may not be as desired. An averaging meter cannot distinguish between a subject of uniform luminance and one that consists of light and dark elements. When exposure is determined from average luminance measurements, the exposure of any given scene element depends on the relationship of its reflectance to the effective average reflectance. For example, a dark object of 4% reflectance would be given a different exposure in a scene of 20% effective average reflectance than it would be given in a scene of 12% reflectance. In a sunlit outdoor scene, the exposure for the dark object would also depend on whether the object was in sunlight or shade. Depending on the scene and the photographer's objective, any of the previous exposures might be acceptable. However, in some situations, the photographer might wish to specifically control the rendering of the dark object; with overall average metering, this is difficult if not impossible. When it is important to control the rendering of specific scene elements, alternative metering techniques may be required. It is possible to make a meter reading of an individual scene element, but the exposure indicated by the meter will render that element as a medium gray; in the case of a dark object, that result is usually not what is desired. Even when metering individual scene elements, some adjustment of the indicated exposure is often needed if the metered scene element is to be rendered as visualized. = Exposure zones = In the Zone System, measurements are made of individual scene elements, and exposure is adjusted based on the photographer's knowledge of what is being metered: a photographer knows the difference between freshly fallen snow and a black horse, while a meter does not. Much has been written on the Zone System, but the concept is very simplerender light subjects as light, and dark subjects as dark, according to the photographer's visualization. The Zone System assigns numbers from 0 through 10 Adams (1981) designated 11 zones; other photographers, including Picker (1974) and White, Zakia, and Lorenz (1976) used 10 zones. Either approach is workable if the photographer is consistent in her methods. to different brightness values, with 0 representing black, 5 middle gray, and 10 pure white; these values are known as zones. To make zones easily distinguishable from other quantities, Adams and Archer used Roman rather than Arabic numerals. Strictly speaking, zones refer to exposure, Adams (1981) distinguished among exposure zones, negative density values, and print values. The negative density value is controlled by exposure and the negative development; the print value is controlled by the negative density value, and the paper exposure and development. Commonly, \\"zone\\" is also used, if somewhat loosely, to refer to negative density values and print values. with a Zone V exposure (the meter indication) resulting in a mid-tone rendering in the final image. Each zone differs from the preceding or following zone by a factor of two, so that a Zone I exposure is twice that of Zone 0, and so forth. A one- zone change is equal to one stop, Photographers commonly refer to exposure changes in terms of \\"stops\\", but properly, a stop is a device that regulates the amount of light, while a step is a division of a scale. The standard exposure scale consists of power-of-two steps; a one-step exposure increase doubles the exposure, while a one-step decrease halves the exposure. Davis (1999, 13) recommended the term \\"stop\\" to avoid confusion with the steps of a photographic step tablet, which may not correspond to standard power-of-two exposure steps. ISO standards generally use \\"step\\". corresponding to standard aperture and shutter controls on a camera. Evaluating a scene is particularly easy with a meter that indicates in exposure value (EV), because a change of one EV is equal to a change of one zone. Many small- and medium-format cameras include provision for exposure compensation; this feature works well with the Zone System, especially if the camera includes spot metering, but obtaining proper results requires careful metering of individual scene elements and making appropriate adjustments. = Zones, the physical world and the print = The relationship between the physical scene and the print is established by characteristics of the negative and the print. Exposure and development of the negative are usually determined so that a properly exposed negative will yield an acceptable print on a specific photographic paper. Although zones directly relate to exposure, visualization relates to the final result. A black-and-white photographic print represents the visual world as a series of tones ranging from black to white. Imagine all of the tonal values that can appear in a print, represented as a continuous gradation from black to white: Full Tonal Gradation From this starting point, zones are formed by: * Dividing the tonal gradation into eleven equal sections. Eleven-Step Gradation :Note: You may need to adjust the brightness and contrast of your monitor to see the gradations at the dark and light end of the scales. * Blending each section into one tone that represents all the tonal values in that section. { align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-spacing: 0;\\" + Eleven Symbolic Tones - style=\\"height: 3em;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #000000; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #1a1a1a; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #333333; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #4d4d4d; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #666666; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #808080; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #999999; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #b3b3b3; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #cccccc; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #e6e6e6; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #ffffff; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\" } * Numbering each section with Roman numerals from 0 for the black section to X for the white one. { align=\\"center\\" style=\\"text-align: center; border-spacing: 0;\\" + The Zone Scale - style=\\"color: #ffffff; height: 3em;\\"  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #000000; font-weight: bold; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  0  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #1a1a1a; font-weight: bold; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  I  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #333333; font-weight: bold; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  II  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: bold; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  III  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #666666; font-weight: bold; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  IV  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background- color: #808080; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%; width: 2em; margin: 0;\\"  V  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #999999; font-weight: bold; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  VI  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #b3b3b3; font-weight: bold; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  VII  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #cccccc; font-weight: bold; color: #000; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  VIII  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-weight: bold; color: #000; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  IX  style=\\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #ffffff; font- weight: bold; color: #000; width: 3em; margin: 0;\\"  X } = Zones as tone and texture = Adams (1981, 52) distinguished among three different exposure scales for the negative: * The full range from black to white, represented by Zone 0 through Zone X. * The dynamic range comprising Zone I through Zone IX, which Adams considered to represent the darkest and lightest \\"useful\\" negative densities. * The textural range comprising Zone II through Zone VIII. This range of zones conveys a sense of texture and the recognition of substance. He noted that negatives can record detail through Zone XII and even higher, but that bringing this information within the exposure scale of the print is extremely difficult with normal processing. Adams (1981, 60) described the zone scale and its relationship to typical scene elements: Adams's description of zones and their application to typical scene elements was somewhat more extensive than the table in this article. The application of Zone IX to glaring snow is from Adams (1948). { align=\\"center\\" ! Zone !!

In other words, if the text on a piece of white paper is to be readable, light and expose the white so that it falls on Zone VII. This is a rule of thumb. Some film stocks have steeper curves than others, and the cinematographer needs to know how each one handles all shades of black-to-white.  Technique  = Effective film speed = The ISO standard for black-and-white negative film, ISO 6:1993, specifies development criteria that may differ from those used in practical photography (previous standards, such as ANSI PH2.5-1979, also specified chemistry and development technique). Consequently, the Zone System practitioner often must determine the speed for a particular combination of film, developer, and enlarger type; the speed determination is commonly based on Zone I. Although the method for determining speed for the Zone System is conceptually similar to the ISO method for determining speed, the Zone System speed is an effective speed The effective speed determined for a given combination of film and developer is sometimes described as an \\"Exposure Index\\" (EI), but an \\"EI\\" often represents a fairly arbitrary choice rather than the systematic speed determination done for use with the Zone System. rather than an ISO speed. = Exposure = A dark surface under a bright light can reflect the same amount of light as a light surface under dim light. The human eye would perceive the two as being very different but a light meter would measure only the amount of light reflected, and its recommended exposure would render either as Zone V. The Zone System provides a straightforward method for rendering these objects as the photographer desires. The key element in the scene is identified, and that element is placed on the desired zone; the other elements in the scene then fall where they may. With negative film, exposure often favors shadow detail; the procedure then is to # Visualize the darkest area of the subject in which detail is required, and place it on Zone III. The exposure for Zone III is important, because if the exposure is insufficient, the image may not have satisfactory shadow detail. If the shadow detail is not recorded at the time of exposure, nothing can be done to add it later. # Carefully meter the area visualized as Zone III and note the meter's recommended exposure (the meter gives a Zone V exposure). # Adjust the recommended exposure so that the area is placed on Zone III rather than Zone V. To do this, use an exposure two stops less than the meter's recommendation. = Development = For every combination of film, developer, and paper there is a \\"normal\\" development time that will allow a properly exposed negative to give a reasonable print. In many cases, this means that values in the print will display as recorded (e.g. Zone V as Zone V, Zone VI as Zone VI, and so on). In general, optimal negative development will be different for every type and grade of paper. It is often desirable for a print to exhibit a full range of tonal values; this may not be possible for a low-contrast scene if the negative is given normal development. However, the development can be increased to increase the negative contrast so that the full range of tones is available. This technique is known as expansion, and the development usually referred to as \\"plus\\" or \\"N+\\". Criteria for plus development vary among different photographers; Adams used it to raise a Zone VII placement to Zone VIII in the print, and referred to it as \\"N + 1\\" development. Conversely, if the negative for a high-contrast scene is given normal development, desired detail may be lost in either shadow or highlight areas, and the result may appear harsh. However, development can be reduced so that a scene element placed on Zone IX is rendered as Zone VIII in the print; this technique is known as contraction, and the development usually referred to as \\"minus\\" or \\"N‚àí\\". When the resulting change is one zone, it is usually called \\"N ‚àí 1\\" development. It sometimes is possible to make greater adjustments, using \\"N + 2\\" or \\"N ‚àí 2\\" development, and occasionally even beyond. Development has the greatest effect on dense areas of the negative, so that the high values can be adjusted with minimal effect on the low values. The effect of expansion or contraction gradually decreases with tones darker than Zone VIII (or whatever value is used for control of high values). Specific times for N+ or N‚àí developments are determined either from systematic tests, or from development tables provided by certain Zone System books. = Additional darkroom processes = Adams generally used selenium toning when processing prints. Selenium toner acts as a preservative and can alter the color of a print, but Adams used it subtly, primarily because it can add almost a full zone to the tonal range of the final print, producing richer dark tones that still hold shadow detail. His book The Print described using the techniques of dodging and burning to selectively darken or lighten areas of the final print. The Zone System requires that every variable in photography, from exposure to darkroom production of the print, be calibrated and controlled. The print is the last link in a chain of events, no less important to the Zone System than exposure and development of the film. With practice, the photographer visualizes the final print before the shutter is released.  Application to other media  = Roll film = Unlike sheet film, in which each negative can be individually developed, an entire roll must be given the same development, so that N+ and N‚àí development are normally unavailable. If a roll-film camera accepts interchangeable backs, it is possible to use N+ and N‚àí development by designating different backs for different development, and changing backs when the image so requires. Without interchangeable backs, different camera bodies can be designated for different development, but this usually is practical only with small-format cameras. The key element in the scene is placed on the desired zone, and the rest of the scene falls where it will. Some contrast control is still available with the use of different paper grades. Adams (1981, 93-95) described use of the Zone System with roll film. In most cases, he recommended N ‚àí 1 development when a single roll was to be exposed under conditions of varying contrast, so that exposure could be sufficient to give adequate shadow detail but avoid excessive density and grain build-up in the highlights. = Color film = Because of color shifts, color film usually does not lend itself to variations in development time. Use of the Zone System with color film is similar to that with black-and-white roll film, except that the exposure range is somewhat less, so that there are fewer zones between black and white. The exposure scale of color reversal film is less than that of color negative film, and the procedure for exposure usually is different, favoring highlights rather than shadows; the shadow values then fall where they will. Whatever the exposure range, the meter indication results in a Zone V placement. Adams (1981, 95-97) described the application to color film, both negative and reversal. = Digital photography = The Zone System can be used in digital photography just as in film photography; Adams (1981, xiii) himself anticipated the digital image. As with color reversal film, the normal procedure is to expose for the highlights and process for the shadows. Until recently, digital sensors had a much narrower dynamic range than color negative film, which, in turn, has less range than monochrome film. But an increasing number of digital cameras have achieved wider dynamic ranges. One of the first was Fujifilm's FinePix S3 Pro digital SLR, which has their proprietary \\"Super CCD SR sensor\\" specifically developed to overcome the issue of limited dynamic range, using interstitial low-sensitivity photosites (pixels) to capture highlight details. The CCD is thus able to expose at both low and high sensitivities within one shot by assigning a honeycomb of pixels to different intensities of light. Greater scene contrast can be accommodated by making one or more exposures of the same scene using different exposure settings and then combining those images. It often suffices to make two exposures, one for the shadows, and one for the highlights; the images are then overlapped and blended appropriately, so that the resulting composite represents a wider range of colors and tones. Combining images is often easier if the image-editing software includes features, such as the automatic layer alignment in Adobe Photoshop, that assist precise registration of multiple images. Even greater scene contrast can be handled by using more than two exposures and combining with a feature such as Merge to HDR in Photoshop CS2 and later. A simplified approach has been adopted by Apple Inc. as a selectible HDR option in later versions of the iPhone. The tonal range of the final image depends on the characteristics of the display medium. Monitor contrast can vary significantly, depending on the type (CRT, LCD, etc.), model, and calibration (or lack thereof). A computer printer's tonal output depends on the number of inks used and the paper on which it is printed. Similarly, the density range of a traditional photographic print depends on the processes used as well as the paper characteristics.  Histograms  Most high-end digital cameras allow viewing a histogram of the tonal distribution of the captured image. This histogram, which shows the concentration of tones, running from dark on the left to light on the right, can be used to judge whether a full tonal range has been captured, or whether the exposure should be adjusted, such as by changing the exposure time, lens aperture, or ISO speed, to ensure a tonally rich starting image.Discussion on how histograms can be used to implement the Zone System in digital photography (archived 2012-05-01)  Misconceptions and criticisms  The Zone System gained an early reputation for being complex, difficult to understand, and impractical to apply to real-life shooting situations and equipment. Criticism has been raised on grounds that the Zone System obscures simple densitometry considerations by needlessly introducing its own terminology for otherwise trivial concepts. Noted photographer Andreas Feininger wrote in 1976, Much of the difficulty may have resulted from Adams's early books, which he wrote without the assistance of a professional editor; he later conceded (Adams 1985, 325) that this was a mistake. Fred Picker (The Zone VI Workshop 1974) provided a concise and simple treatment that helped demystify the process. Adams's later Photography Series published in the early 1980s (and written with the assistance of Robert Baker) also proved far more comprehensible to the average photographer. The Zone System has often been thought to apply only to certain materials, such as black-and-white sheet film and black-and-white photographic prints. At a time when introduction of electronic still image cameras to the consumer market was imminent (e.g. the Sony Mavica), Adams (1981, xii) stated which is sometimes interpreted as evidence that Adams envisioned his Zone System to be useful for electronic or even digital image capture/processing. However, in this quotation there is no claim that the Zone System would be a suitable instrument to comprehend and control the new imaging devices, and Adams explicitly states that electronic systems may have their own characteristics (which might thus require different approaches). Yet another misconception is that the Zone System emphasizes technique at the expense of creativity. Some practitioners have treated the Zone System as if it were an end in itself, but Adams made it clear that the Zone System was an enabling technique rather than the ultimate objective.

The civilians were captured in groups of unsuspecting passers-by or kidnapped from selected city quarters that had been surrounded in advance by German forces.Ron Jeffery (1989), Red Runs the Vistula. Nevron Associates Publ., Manurewa, Auckland, New Zealand. via Google Books, snippet. Those caught in roundups were most often sent to slave labour in Germany, but some were also taken as hostages or executed in reprisal actions; imprisoned and sent to concentration camps or summarily executed in numerous ethnic-cleansing operations. History Street roundup in Warsaw 1941 The term ≈Çapanka, derived from the Polish verb ≈Çapaƒá (\\"to catch\\"), carried a sardonic connotation due to the prior use of the word ≈Çapanka for the children's game known in English as \\"tag\\". (pl), Warsaw, 1942 Most people who were rounded up were transported to labour camps (Arbeitslager), including Auschwitz. Many Polish women were selected for sexual slavery. Many Polish children were kidnapped for adoption by German families. Some ‚àí those without proper documents or carrying contraband ‚àí were transported to concentration and death camps. Others, particularly Jews in hiding and Poles wanted for harboring them, were shot dead on the spot. The term was also used for describing the tactic of cordoning-off of streets, and the systematic searching of buildings. For young men in their 20s and 30s, the only reliable defense against being taken away by the Nazis was the possession of an identity card (called Ausweis) certifying that the holder was employed by a German company or a government agency locally (for example, by the city utilities or the railways). Thus, many of those who were taken from cafes and restaurants in Warsaw on the night of December 5, 1940 were subsequently released after their documents had been checked.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, 1859 dni Warszawy (1859 Days of Warsaw), p. 167. Sicherheitsdienst roundup, occupied Poland According to estimates, in Warsaw alone between 1942 and 1944 the Nazi ≈Çapankas claimed at least 400 victims every day, with numbers reaching several thousand on some days. On 19 September 1942, nearly 3,000 men and women, who had been caught in massive round-ups all over Warsaw during the previous two days, were transported by train-loads to slave labour in Germany.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, 1859 dni Warszawy (1859 Days of Warsaw), pp. 303-4. Targeted territories Nazi German roundup in France (rafle), Marseille January 1943. Such roundups as Poland's ≈Çapanka were carried out by the Germans in other occupied countries as well, particularly in northern France, although not as extensively as in Poland. The French term for this practice was rafle, applied primarily to the rounding-up of French Jews. In Denmark and the Netherlands, a Nazi roundup was called razzia. In historical terms, the razzia roundup was used in French colonial context for Muslim raids particularly to plunder and capture slaves from Western and Central Africa, also known as rezzou when practiced by the Tuareg. (See also: Barbary slave trade) The word was adopted from ƒ°aziya of Algerian Arabic vernacular and later became a figurative name for any act of pillage, with its verb form razzier. The Soviets used similar tactics to round up middle-class Poles in the part of Poland that they occupied following the 1939 invasion of Poland. Men, women, and children were transported to labour camps in remote regions of the Soviet Union.Norman Davies (1996), Europe: A History, Oxford University Press, pp. 1002-3. . Polish resistance Bydgoszcz roundup on 8 September 1939. In 1940, one roundup was used by Home Army secret agent Witold Pilecki to gain entry into the Auschwitz camp set up at about that time for Polish prisoners. There, he gathered first-hand intelligence on the camp, and organised inmate resistance.Jozef Garlinski (1975), Fighting Auschwitz: the Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp, Fawcett, ; reprinted by Time Life Education, 1993. . Pilecki deliberately went out into the street during a Warsaw roundup on 19 September 1940, and was arrested by the Germans along with other civilians. Auschwitz was the main destination for the Poles from beyond the ghetto. There he organised ZwiƒÖzek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW, the Military Organization Association), and in November 1940 sent its first report about the camp and the genocide being committed there to Home Army headquarters in Warsaw.Adam Cyra, Ochotnik do Auschwitz - Witold Pilecki 1901-1948 [Volunteer for Auschwitz], O≈õwiƒôcim 2000.

Because of the particular brutality of the police, the AK killed 361 gendarmes in 1943, and 584 in 1944. In Warsaw alone, ten Germans were killed daily.

She was the second ship to join the Disney fleet on entering service in 1999. Wonder is of the same class as Disney Magic. The interior of Disney Wonder is decorated in the Art Nouveau style, in contrast to her sister ship, Disney Magic which is decorated in the Art Deco style. Both ships have 11 public decks, can accommodate 2,400 passengers in 875 staterooms, and have a crew of approximately 950. Disney Wonder was built in the year following completion of Disney Magic. , Disney Wonder sails various North American itineraries on a seasonal basis. From early September to late October 2016, the ship underwent dry dock in Cadiz, Spain where she had many new dining, entertainment, and accommodation enhancements.  History  Disney Wonder in Puerto Vallarta Disney had cruise ship designs drawn up by February 1994. Disney Cruise Line in 1995 commissioned Disney Magic and Disney Wonder from Fincantieri in Italy. She was laid down on May 5, 1997, launched on February 23, 1998, and completed on June 18, 1999. The ship's godmother was Disney character Tinkerbell (who only spoke with bell sounds), and Mickey Mouse (voiced by Wayne Allwine) gave the ship's blessing in English. Wonder entered into service in August 1999. Disney Wonder originally sailed three- and four-night cruises to The Bahamas. In 2011, took over these itineraries. Since then, the Disney Wonder has been sailing a variety of itineraries that include stops in Alaska, the Mexican Riviera, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and passages through the Panama Canal. Rebecca Coriam, a 24-year-old crew member, was last seen by one of Disney Wonders security cameras having an apparently upsetting telephone conversation in the early morning hours of March 22, 2011, before apparently disappearing the next day. It was the first such incident in the history of Disney Cruise Lines. With the arrival of Disney Dream in 2011, Disney Wonder was relocated to Los Angeles under a two-year contract with a three-year extension with the port. On January 10, 2013, the ship made her first-call ceremony in Miami. Cruises while stationed in Miami would consist of four- and five-night itineraries to the Bahamas and Western Caribbean with stops in Cozumel, Mexico; Disney's private island, Castaway Cay; Grand Cayman; Key West and Nassau, Bahamas. The Disney Wonder returned in April 2013 to Vancouver for Alaskan cruises. The ship was dry docked for an overhaul at the Navantia shipyard in Cadiz, Spain in September 2016 until October 23, 2016. Wonder was then stationed out of Galveston, Texas starting November 10, 2016. In October 2018, Disney Cruise Line began showing Disney at Sea with D23, a 30-minute entertainment news show that covers the many Disney subsidiaries with input from D23, starting with Disney Wonder. A cruise in spring 2020 was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ship arrived at the Port of San Diego on March 19, 2020, where 1,980 passengers disembarked; there were no reports that any had flu-like symptoms. By April 5, 38 crew members had reportedly tested positive to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, according to a report by Cruise Law News based on discussions with unnamed individuals on the ship. Disney, however, told other news media that none of the crew had tested positive. A passenger who disembarked at San Diego on March 20 reported that no health screening activities, such as the asking of health-related questions or the taking of temperatures, had occurred upon disembarkation, and that the only health screening that occurred was during the check-in process two weeks prior. After disembarking the passengers in March the ship was placed under a no-sail order, effective through July, by the Centers for Disease Control. As of May 2020 Disney Wonder and two other cruise ships were still at anchor offshore from San Diego. Approximately 700 crew were reportedly still aboard Disney Wonder.  Recreation  For children (3-12) there are the Oceaneers Club, and the Oceaneers Lab. The Club provides a slide, multiple TVs, dress up clothing, and counselor-led activities. The Lab provides video games, computers, cooking classes, and TV time geared towards the older end of that age bracket. Children receive an RFID badge when registered that allows the cruise staff to know the child's location in the activity areas.

He was one of the outstanding figures in contemporary Danish music. His works are frequently performed at festivals at home and abroad, and he had established particularly close links with musical life in Poland and Germany. He was honoured with several international prizes and was named Choral Composer of the Year in Denmark in 1989 (Source: Edition¬∑S ‚Äì music¬¨sound¬¨art ‚Äì Denmark).  Life  Bent Lorentzen was born in Stenvad, a village on Djursland, East Jutland. He studied musicology at the university in Aarhus and at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. He was a pupil of Knud Jeppesen, Finn H√∏ffding, Vagn Holmboe and J√∏rgen Jersild. After his final examination he taught at the Academies of Music in Aarhus and Copenhagen for several years. (Source: Bonde 2005) Lorentzen was one of the earliest pioneers in the field of Danish electronic music (The Bottomless Pit in 1972 for the Nordic Music Days in Oslo, and Visions 1978), which was also introduced with an educational aim: the LP Elektronmusikkens materiale [The Material of Electronic Music, 1968] and the LP Water ‚Äì electronic music for children, 1968. (Source: Bonde 2005) Lorentzen's orchestral music includes concertos for oboe (1980), cello (1984), piano (1984), saxophone (1986), trumpet (1991) and violin (2001); his chamber music comprises solo works for organ, piano, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, guitar, violin, cello and double- bass, as well as string quartets and works with mixed ensembles (2-12 instruments). He also composed numerous choral works in a unique dramatic style. Lorentzen's most important part of his works, however, are his operas and other works for the stage. His last opera Der Steppenwolf (Libretto after Hermann Hesse's novel by Michael Leinert) was first performed in Aarhus 2016 in a semi-concert version.  Awards  Lorentzen held a number of important posts in different organisations in the Danish musical life, and he was the artistic director of the Ebeltoft Festival 1990-93. He was a prizewinner at several foreign competitions such as the Prix Italia in 1970 (for the opera Euridice), the Serocki composers‚Äô competition in 1984 (for the chamber work Paradiesvogel), the International Competition for Choir Compositions in Austria 1987 (for Olof Palme), the Olivier Messiaen Organ Prize in 1988 (for Luna), Vienna Modern Masters in 1991 (for the Piano Concerto) and the Music and Poetry Prize in Belgium in 1989 (for Enzensberger‚Äôs Prozession). He was awarded ‚ÄùDanish Choir Composer of the year‚Äù in 1990 and the Carl Nielsen Prize in 1995 and in 2003 the Wilhelm Hansen Composer Prize. Since 1982 and until his death, Lorentzen had received the lifelong grant of the Danish Art Council.

During the January 1863 Uprising, it served as a transfer camp for Poles sentenced by Imperial Russia to deportation to Siberia. During the World War II German occupation of Poland, it was used by the Germans, and in 1944 it was destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising. History Pawiak Prison took its name from that of the street on which it stood, ulica Pawia (Polish for \\"Peacock Street\\"). Pawiak Prison was built in 1829‚Äì35 to the design of Enrico Marconi and Fryderyk Florian Skarbek, prison reformer and godfather to composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. During the 19th century, it was under czarist control as Warsaw was part of the Russian Empire. During that time, it was the main prison of central Poland, where political prisoners and criminals alike were incarcerated. During the January 1863 Uprising, the prison served as a transfer camp for Poles sentenced by Imperial Russia to deportation to Siberia. After Poland regained independence in 1918, the Pawiak Prison became Warsaw's main prison for male criminals. (Females were detained at the nearby Serbia Prison.) Following the 1939 German invasion of Poland, the Pawiak Prison became a German Gestapo prison. Approximately 100,000 people were imprisoned during the prison's operation, some 37,000 died on premises (executed, under torture, or during detention), and 60,000 were transferred to Nazi concentration camps. large number of Jews passed through Pawiak and Serbia after the closure of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and during the first deportation in July to August 1942.History of the prison - official website of the museum Exact numbers are unknown, as the prison archives were never found. During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Pawiak Prison became a German assault base. Pawiak jailers, commanded by Franz B√ºrkl, volunteered to hunt the Jews. On 19 July 1944 a Ukrainian Wachmeister (guard) Petrenko and some prisoners attempted a mass jailbreak, supported by an attack from outside, but failed. Petrenko and several others committed suicide. The resistance attack detachment was ambushed and practically annihilated. Next day, in reprisal, the Germans executed over 380 prisoners. As Julien Hirshaut convincingly argues in Jewish Martyrs of Pawiak, it is inconceivable that the prison-escape attempt was a Gestapo-initiated provocation. The Polish underground had approved the plan but backed out without being able to alert those in the prison that the plan was cancelled. The final transport of prisoners took place 30 July 1944, two days before the 1 August outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. Two thousand men and the remaining 400 women were sent to Gross-Rosen and Ravensbr√ºck. Subsequently the Polish insurgents captured the area but lost it to German forces. On 21 August 1944 the Germans shot an unknown number of remaining prisoners and burned and blew up the buildings. After World War II, the buildings were not rebuilt. Half of the gateway and three detention cells survive. Since 1990 a surviving basement has housed a museum which, with the Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom, forms the Museum of Independence.

He was a follower of Hinduism. Pushyamitra was originally a Senapati \\"General\\" of the Maurya Empire. In 185 BCE he assassinated the last Mauryan Emperor, Brihadratha Maurya, during an army review, and proclaimed himself emperor. Pushyamitra is recorded to have performed numerous Ashvamedha campaigns to legitimize his right to rule. Inscriptions of the Shungas have been found as far as the Ayodhya (the Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription), and the Divyavadana mentions that he sent an army to persecute Buddhist monks as far as Sakala (Sialkot) in the Punjab region in the northwest. The Buddhist texts state that Pushyamitra cruelly persecuted the Buddhists, although some modern scholars have expressed skepticism about these claims.  Ancestry  A silver coin of 1 karshapana of King Pushyamitra Sunga (185-149 BC) of the Sunga dynasty (185-73 BC), workshop of Vidisa (?). Obv: 5 symbols including a sun Rev: 2 symbols. Bronze coin of the Shunga period, Eastern India. 2nd‚Äì1st century BCE. Pushyamitra Shunga was the hereditary ruler of Vidisha. It was incorporated into the Maurya Empire uptil his led coup d'√©tat. Several sources suggest that Pushyamitra was a Brahmin warrior and the 16th century Buddhist scholar Taranatha explicitly calls him a Brahmin king. However, the various sources offer differing suggestions about which Brahmin gotra (clan) Pushyamitra belonged to. A Puranic manuscript mentions persons who were born of \\"Shunga, a descendant of Bharadvaja, by a woman married in the family of Kata, a descendant of Vishvamitra\\". Based on this, K. P. Jayaswal theorized that Shunga was a Brahmin with two gotras (dwaimushyayana or dvigotra): his family traced their ancestry to both Bharadvaja and Vishvamitra lineages. The Pravara Kanda of the Apastamba mentions a \\"Shunga-Shaishiri\\" gotra. J. C. Ghosh theorized that the Shunga family derived from the Shunga of the Bharadvaja gotra, and the Shaishiri of the Vishvamitra gotra (Kata group).Ghosh, J.C.,\\"The Dynastic-Name of the Kings of the Pushyamitra Family,\\" J.B.O.R.S, Vol. XXXIII, 1937, p.360 However, the Matsya Purana mentions the \\"Shunga-Shaishiri\\" dwaimushyayana gotra (named \\"Shaunga-Shaishireya\\" here) as a combination of the Bharadvaja and Kashyapa (not Vishvamitra) gotras. The Harivamsa mentions a twice-born general of the Kashyapa gotra who performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice. Some scholars such as Jayaswal identify this general with Pushyamitra. The Malavikagnimitra describes Pushyamitra as a \\"Baimbaki\\". H. C. Raychaudhuri, who read this term as \\"Baimbika\\", identified it with Baimbakayah of the Baudhayana Shrauta Sutra, who was of the Kashyapa gotra (although other scholars believe that the term \\"Baimbaki\\" signifies descent from a person named Bimba, or refers to a heroic lover in general). Bela Lahiri theorizes that the constituents of a dwaimushyayana gotra may have differed during different periods, and Pushyamitra may have belonged to one of these gotras. According to the Puranas, Pushyamitra became the king after killing his master Brihadratha, the last Mauryan king. However, the Buddhist text Divyavadana names Pushyamitra as the last Mauryan king. This text appears to have confused Brihadratha with Pushyamitra. H. C. Raychaudhuri theorized that the name \\"Shunga\\" is derived from the Sanskrit word for the fig tree.Raychaudhari Hemchandra, \\"Tha Audvijja Senani of the Harivansa?\\", Indian culture, Vol. IV, 1938, P. 360-365  Alleged persecution of Buddhists  = Buddhist accounts = Sunga horseman, Bharhut. Buddhist texts state that Pushyamitra cruelly persecuted the Buddhists. The earliest source to mention this is the 2nd Century CE text Ashokavadana (a part of Divyavadana). According to this account, Pushyamitra (described as the last Mauryan king) wanted to be famous. His ministers advised him that as long as Buddhism remained the dominant faith, he would never be as famous as his ancestor Ashoka, who had commissioned 84,000 stupas. One advisor told him that he could become famous by destroying Buddhism. Pushyamitra then tried to destroy the Kukkutarama monastery, but it was saved by a miracle. He then proceeded to Shakala in the north-west, where he offered a prize of one hundred dinaras (gold coins) for every head of a Buddhist monk brought to him. Next, he proceeded to the Koshthaka kingdom, where a Buddhist yaksha named Damshtranivasin killed him and his army with help of another yaksha named Krimisha. Vibhasa, another 2nd century text, states that Pushyamitra burned Buddhist scriptures, killed Buddhist monks, and destroyed 500 monasteries in and around Kashmir. In this campaign, he was supported by yakshas, kumbhandas, and other demons. However, when he reached the Bodhi tree, the deity of that tree took the form of a beautiful woman and killed him. Shariputrapariprichha, translated into Chinese between 317 and 420 CE also mentions this legend, but this particular version is more detailed, and describes eastern India (not Kashmir) as the center of Pushyamitra's anti-Buddhist campaign. The medieval-era Arya-Manjushri-Mula- Kalpa mentions a wicked and foolish king named Gomimukhya (\\"cattle-faced\\"), or Gomishanda (\\"Gomin, the bull\\"), who seized the territory from the east to Kashmir, destroying monasteries and killing monks. Ultimately, he and his officers were killed in the north by falling mountain rocks. This king is identified with Pushyamitra by some scholars. The 16th-century Tibetan Buddhist historian Taranatha also states that Pushyamitra and his allies killed Buddhist monks and destroyed monasteries from madhyadesha (midland) to Jalandhara. These activities wiped out the Buddhist doctrine from the north, within five years. = Authenticity of Buddhist claims = Men riding elephants. Bharhut, Sunga period. Based on Buddhist tradition, some scholars believe that Pushyamitra was indeed a persecutor of the Buddhist faith. However, others believe that Buddhist scholars were biased against Pushyamitra, because he did not patronize them. V. A. Smith and H. P. Shastri believed that Pushyamitra's rebellion against the Maurya dynasty was a Brahminical reaction to the rise of Buddhism. According to archaeologist John Marshall, there is evidence of some damage to Buddhist establishments at Takshashila around the time of Shunga rule. He also theorized that the Sanchi stupa was vandalized in 2nd century BCE (that is, during Pushyamitra's reign), before being rebuilt on a larger scale. G. R. Sharma, who excavated the Buddhist ruins at Kaushambi, suggested that the destruction of the local monastery might have happened during the reign of Pushyamitra Shunga. P. K. Mishra believes that the damage to the Deur Kothar stupa is also datable to Pushyamitra's period. H. C. Raychaudhari pointed out that Buddhist monuments were constructed at Bharhut during the Shunga rule. However, according to N. N. Ghosh, these were constructed during the reign of later Shunga rulers, not Pushyamitra's period. H. Bhattacharya theorized that Pushyamitra might have persecuted Buddhists for political, rather than religious, reasons: the politically active Buddhists probably supported the Indo-Greek rivals of Pushyamitra, which might have prompted him to persecute them. The Ashokavadana states that Pushyamitra declared a reward for killing Buddhist monks in Shakala (present-day Sialkot), which was located near the Indo-Greek frontiers. According to K. P. Jayaswal, this further highlights a political motivation behind his alleged persecution of Buddhists. Many other scholars have expressed skepticism about the Buddhist claims of persecution by Pushyamitra. √âtienne Lamotte points out that the Buddhist legends are not consistent about the location of Pushyamitra's anti-Buddhist campaign and his death. The Ashokavadana claims that Pushyamitra offered dinaras as a reward for killing Buddhist monks, but the dinara did not come into circulation in India before the 1st century CE. Ashokavadana also claims that Ashoka persecuted Nirgranthas (Ajivikas), which is an obvious fabrication, considering that Ashoka's edicts express tolerance towards all religious sects. The Sri Lankan Buddhist text Mahavamsa suggests that several monasteries existed in present-day Bihar, Awadh and Malwa at the time Pushyamitra's contemporary Dutthagamani ruled in Lanka. This suggests that these monasteries survived Pushyamitra Shunga's reign. H. C. Raychaudhury argued that Pushyamitra's overthrow of the Mauryans cannot be considered as a Brahmin uprising against Buddhist rule, as Brahmins did not suffer during the Mauryan rule: Ashoka's edicts mention the Brahmins before Shramanas, and the appointment of a Brahmin general (Pushyamitra) shows that the Brahmins were honoured at the Mauryan court. The fact that the Ashokavadana mentions Pushyamitra as a Mauryan further erodes its historical credibility, and weakens the hypothesis that he persecuted Buddhists because he was a Brahmin. Raychaudhury also aruged that according to Malavikagnimitra, a Buddhist nun named Bhagavati Kaushiki attended Pushyamitra's court, which indicates that they did not persecute Buddhists. However, Shankar Goyal states that there is no evidence of Kaushiki being a Buddhist nun. Romila Thapar writes that the lack of concrete archaeological evidence casts doubt on the claims of Buddhist persecution by Pushyamitra.A≈õoka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200 It is possible that the Buddhist influence at the Mauryan court declined during Pushyamitra's reign, and the Buddhist monasteries and other institutions stopped receiving royal patronage. This change might have led to discontent among the Buddhists, resulting in exaggerated accounts of persecution. Michael Witzel states that Manudharma, which emphasizes the role of orthodox faith in state-craft and society, was first compiled under Pushyamitra's rule. According to Kaushik Roy, it was a Brahmanical reaction to the rise of Buddhism and Jainism.Roy, Kaushik (2012).

Succession of the throne  Pushyamitra Shunga was succeeded in 148 BCE by his son Agnimitra.  In literature  Pushyamitra Shunga's history is recorded in the Harshacharita authored by BƒÅ·πáabha·π≠·π≠a. According to Vicarasreni of Merutunga, Pushyamitra or Pushpamitra got his throne in 204 BC.

Composing career She used to work for Telenet Japan and Riot, but many people who worked for these two companies left, and along with Naruke, later started working for Media.Vision. She has composed music for games outside of the Wild ARMs series, such as Psycho Dream on the Super Famicom and the Tenshi no Uta series on the PC Engine. While it was speculated that Naruke composed under the pseudonym \\"Hassy\\" for the @MIDI albums, the composer herself has stated that Hassy is a separate individual (Hiroya Hatsushiba).\\"I have an idea of who Hassy might be,\\" says the composer, referring to the pseudonym attributed to her on Wikipedia. \\"I think we might have even worked together a long time ago.\\" She has made a number of songs for Media.Vision's Wild ARMs series. Occasionally, the main theme and ending theme of the Wild ARMs songs will contain lyrics, formerly being sung by Machiko Watanabe and Kaori Asoh. Most recently, for the tenth anniversary, a new vocalist has been introduced, Nana Mizuki. Her compositions in the Wild ARMs series include her signature whistling parts, whistled by Naoki Takao. Naruke has composed more than 400 songs for the Wild ARMs series. However, during the development of Wild ARMs: The 4th Detonator, Naruke fell ill, marking the first time in the Wild ARMs series that she did not compose the entire soundtrack. In an interview for Wild ARMs: Piece of Tears, Naruke revealed items which she values, including her keyboard and rhythm machine, a pamphlet of Jerry Goldsmith, a figure of Kurokishi from \\"Gingaman\\", an original score of Bach, and a memorial vinyl disc.

A successor to the Morris Marina, it was available in a variety of bodystyles. Design and launch 1984 Morris Ital SLX rear The Ital was given the design code ADO73 and was first launched on 1 July 1980. It took its name from Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign studio, who had been employed by BL to manage the reengineering of the Morris Marina, a car which had been produced by the company since 1971. BL's advertising emphasised the car's connection with the Italian design house, which had not had a direct role in the styling of the new car, which had been handled in-house by Harris Mann. Italdesign had been involved in a consultancy role to help design new tooling and assembly methods and work out how to integrate the altered parts of the new car into the existing Marina production chain. This is why, despite bearing the studio's name, the Ital is absent from lists of the styling jobs handled by the firm. It was originally planned to brand the car as the Morris Marina Ital, but for most markets the Marina name was dropped on the orders of Michael Edwardes and only the Ital name was used.Marina/Ital Development Story, AROnline A Morris Ital Estate seen in Cambridge in 1981. 1984 Morris Ital Van (1.3) The Ital had revised exterior styling, but retained the Marina's 1.3 and 1.7 litre petrol engines and rear-wheel drive chassis. The dashboard and interior of the Marina were also carried over largely unaltered, including the main fascia panel which faced 'away' from the driver. The Marina's coup√© variant was not produced in Ital form, but the four door saloon, five door estate and pick up and van versions were carried over from the Marina range. From October 1980, an automatic version of the Ital was available with the 2.0 litre O-Series power unit, as the range topping 2.0HLS. Only about 1,000 2.0HLS models were sold so due to this and their short production run, the 2.0HLS is now the rarest Ital model. In November 1981 all HL and HLS models were fitted with upgraded interior trim. Finally, in September 1982, a revised Ital range was introduced. The L and 2.0 litre models were dropped and the HL and HLS were replaced by the SL and SLX models. Front suspension was changed to telescopic front dampers across the range and parabolic rear springs were also fitted, together with additional soundproofing and improved trim. Thus cropped, the range now consisted of the 1.3 SL and SLX saloon, 1.3 SL estate, 1.7 SLX saloon, and the 1.7 SL saloon and estate. The saloon models were dropped in February 1984, with the estate models remaining in production until the summer of that year. During the 1970s, British Leyland had in fact been working on the development of an all new car to replace the Morris Marina, but a shortage of funds meant that its launch was delayed by several years, and the Ital was only ever intended as a stop gap replacement between the demise of the Marina and the launch of an entirely new model, which emerged in April 1984, with the launch of the Austin Montego. Portuguese assembly Marina designation. The car in this picture has an early 1980s Portuguese registration plate. Although most Itals were manufactured in the United Kingdom, there were also Portuguese assembled Itals which were all equipped with the ancient 1.5 litre B-series diesel engine, producing 37 hp.Marina-Based Models, AROnline Portuguese Itals retained the \\"Marina\\" badge (actually \\"Morris Marina 1.5 D\\") and were the only Marina/Itals to receive a diesel engine of any kind. The British Leyland factory in Set√∫bal (IMA) then switched to producing the Mini Moke. Sales The Ital sold reasonably well in Britain during the start of the 1980s, as it offered a competitive asking price and low running costs. The Ital's technology differed from many of its contemporaries, such as the Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier, as well as the Talbot Alpine, which all used front wheel drive. After the introduction of the Opel Ascona C / Vauxhall Cavalier Mark II in August 1981, the Ital and Ford's Cortina (and later Sierra) were the only mass volume cars in the sector to retain rear wheel drive. Demise of Morris The Ital was the last production car to wear the Morris badge, although there was a Morris badged van version of the Metro produced until 1984. Production of the Ital was switched from Cowley to Longbridge in September 1982 to allow the Cowley plant to be upgraded for production of the forthcoming Austin Montego and Austin Maestro. At this time, the Ital received an upgrade with different front and rear suspension (parabolic rear springs and telescopic front dampers) and models were redesignated SL and SLX. The saloon was dropped from the line in February 1984 with the van and estate completing outgoing contracts for another six months, until they too were axed. From this point, the Morris marque was kept alive solely by the Metro van, and three years later the Morris badge had finally been consigned to history after 75 years, when it was removed from the van version of the Metro. The Ital's successor was the Austin Montego, launched in April 1984 as a four-door saloon, with a five-door estate arriving in October 1984. Later production in China After production in the United Kingdom ceased, the Ital's production tooling was sold to the Chengdu Auto Works, a company belonging to the First Auto Works Group in Sichuan province, China. In 1998, the Ital estate (utilising a locally made chassis) reappeared there, under the name Huandu CAC6430. Van and pick up variants were also produced. Chengdu Auto Works is thought to have closed down in May 1999. Reputation Already outdated by the time it was launched, and continually saddled with build quality problems, the Ital soon gained a very bad reputation. The Ital was said to have similar rust problems to its predecessor, the Morris Marina, and despite being designated as a successor; surviving Itals are actually rarer than Marinas today on UK roads, although the Morris Marina Owners Club and Morris Ital Register are making sure the few remaining examples survive. As of 2020, there were only 39 Morris Itals still taxed and on the roads in the UKhttps://www.carlogbook.co.uk/morris/ital/, with another 155 Itals declared SORN (Statutory Off-Road Notice)https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical- data-sets/all-vehicles-veh01#statutory-off-road-notification-vehicles-sorn.

He is best known for his work on the Mana and SaGa series, though he has worked on over 30 video games throughout his career as well as composed or arranged music for over 15 other albums, concerts, and plays. He learned to play several instruments at a young age, and joined Square directly out of college as a composer in 1990 at the advice of a professor. He worked there for over a decade, composing many of his best-known scores. In 2001, he left Square to become a freelance composer, but has since continued to collaborate with the company. Since leaving Square, Ito has composed soundtracks to over a dozen games, and has branched out into composition and production of music for plays and albums for other performers. Ito's work has been performed in a concert dedicated to his pieces as well as general video game music events, and he has played the piano in additional concerts. Pieces of his from the SaGa and Mana series have been arranged as piano solos and published in sheet music books. Biography =Early life= Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became interested in music at the age of four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming interested in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square. =Career= His first project was a co-effort that same year between himself and Nobuo Uematsu for the Game Boy title Final Fantasy Legend II (SaGa 2). It led the following year to the first album release of his music, All Sounds of SaGa, which was a combination album of The Final Fantasy Legend, Final Fantasy Legend II, and Final Fantasy Legend III; all of Ito's work on Legend II appeared on the album. Shortly after in 1991, he composed his first solo work, the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure (Seiken Densetsu), another Game Boy title. He then returned to the SaGa series for the next few years, composing the soundtracks to the Super Famicom's Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa 2, and Romancing SaGa 3. These soundtracks sparked Ito's first arranged albums; the first game was arranged in a French musical style by Masaaki Mizuguchi, while the other two were arranged by Ryou Fukui and Taro Iwashiro, respectively, into orchestral pieces. Ito was originally scheduled to continue on with the Mana series and compose the soundtrack to Seiken Densetsu 2 (Secret of Mana), but was forced to hand the project off to Hiroki Kikuta as his first score due to the demand on his time for scoring Romancing SaGa. 1995 marked the first time since he started composing that he worked on a title outside the Mana or SaGa series; he composed the music for Koi wa Balance and was a member of an eight-person team for Tobal No. 1. He returned to the SaGa series in 1997 with SaGa Frontier, and finished out the decade with Chocobo Racing and Chocobo's Dungeon 2; for Chocobo Racing he only arranged previous works from the Chocobo and Final Fantasy series, and contributed only a few tracks to Chocobo's Dungeon 2. He left Square in 2001 to become a freelance composer. He has said that this move was in order to give him the flexibility to work on more than just video game music. The first work that Ito composed after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which he regards as his best work. He attributes this feeling both to the fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song. He has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works. Legacy Ito performed piano live during September 22, 2006 Press Start 2006 -Symphony of Games- live concert, at which several of his pieces were performed by an orchestra. This concert followed an concert of August 26, 2006 Manami Kiyota x Kenji Ito Collaboration Live in which he played the piano for songs composed by him for the event and sung by Manami Kiyota; he has also played the piano at concerts given by The Black Mages, a band composed of current or former Square musicians, before they expanded to include a full- time pianist. Music composed by Ito has also been performed at the Extra -Hyper Game Music Event 2007 and Christmas Live 2008 \\"gentleecho -prelude-\\" concerts. Music composed by Ito was performed at a concert devoted to his music on February 21, 2009 titled \\"gentle echo meeting\\" at the Uchisaiwaicho Hall in Chiyoda, Tokyo. A group of five musicians performed eight of his songs, interspersed with performances by Ito and discussions about his music between himself and Masahiro Sakurai. The event began as a concert due to Ito's wish to host one based on his music, but after the space the organizing company, Harmonics International, rented turned out to be run by a high school classmate of Ito, at the classmate's insistence the discussions of Ito's music were added to the program. Music from the original soundtracks of Dawn of Mana and Sword of Mana has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Two compilation books of music from the series as a whole have also been published as Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music first and second editions, with the first edition including tracks by Ito from Final Fantasy Adventure while the second added tracks he composed from Dawn of Mana. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. Additionally, KMP Music Publishing has published a book of the piano music included in the Sword of Mana soundtrack album, which Ito arranged from his original compositions. DOREMI Music Publishing also published music from the original soundtracks of some of the SaGa games that Ito composed as piano sheet music book; music from Romancing SaGa 3, Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song, and SaGa Frontier were written by Asako Niwa for piano solos of beginning to intermediate difficulty. Musical style and influences Ito's music is mainly inspired by images from the game rather than outside influences; however, he never played the games themselves. The only video games that he plays are sports games; he has only seen up to the introductory movie for most of the role-playing games that he has written music for. While many of his pieces are orchestral, he enjoys working in a recording studio and enjoys composing \\"normal songs\\" as much as his orchestral works. His favorite video game music from other composers include the music from Star Fox, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Wizardry and Nobunaga's Ambition. Non-video game music that has inspired him includes Japanese popular music and soundtracks to anime works, as well as easy listening music such as Paul Mauriat or Richard Clayderman, especially string music. These influences have led him to wish to create music \\"that you can listen to while you relax\\". He also wishes to expand his compositions outside video game music and into ballads.

In early 1916, the 12th Battalion, Sherwood Foresters stationed in the front line at Ypres, Belgium, came across an abandoned printing press. A sergeant who had been a printer in peacetime salvaged it and printed a sample page. The paper itself was named after Tommy slang pronunciation of Ypres. Publication history Under its initial title The Wipers Times and Salient News, the first issue was published on 6 February 1916, with a circulation of one hundred copies. It was followed by another 22 issues, mostly consisting of 12 pages each. While the size and the layout of the magazine remained consistent, its main title changed many times. Previous titles remained listed in the subtitle in chronological order, for instance: The B.E.F. Times: with which are incorporated The Wipers Times, The \\"New Church\\" Times, The Kemmel Times & The Somme-Times. Every main title change initiates a new volume and issue sequence and as result, there are several instances of 'volume 1, number 1'. Publication was held up after February 1918 by the German offensive on the western front in that year, but at the end of the War, two issues were published as The Better Times. The second of these was billed as the Xmas, Peace and Final Number. Personnel The names of the staff involved in the paper are mostly unrecorded. The editor was Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) F. J. Roberts (Frederick John Roberts), MC, the sub-editor was Lieutenant (later Lieutenant-Colonel) J. H. Pearson (John Hesketh (\\"Jack\\") Pearson), DSO, MC.Army Medal Office. WWI Medal Index Cards A notable contributor to the paper was Artilleryman Gilbert Frankau. Also worthy of note are the engravings by E.J. Couzens; his portrait of a chinless platoon commander clutching his cane and wondering \\"Am I as offensive as I might be?\\" became the paper's motif. Most other contributors from the Division used pseudonyms: some now obscure; some intended to satirize contemporary newspaper pundits such as William Beach Thomas (of the Daily Mail) and Hilaire Belloc; and some ironic, such as P.B.I. (Poor Bloody Infantry). Contents The paper consisted of poems, reflections, wry in-jokes and lampoons of the military situation the Division was in. In general the paper maintained a humorously ironic style that today can be recognised in satirical magazines such as The Duffel Blog, Private Eye, Le Canard encha√Æn√© and The Onion. =Adverts= The covers of the issues were mostly mock adverts, richly typeset, often for war-related music-hall extravaganzas. Similar adverts appeared on the back and front inside covers: File:The Wipers Times 1916-05-08 p1.jpg File:The Wipers Times 1916-02-26 p2.jpg There were also sales offers for pleasant stays at unlikely locations like the city ramparts, for weapons like the flammenwerfer (flamethrower) and even for the complete Ypres Salient front line: File:The Wipers Times 1916-03-20 p10.jpg File:The Wipers Times 1916-03-20 p1.jpg =Vocabulary= The daily concerns of trench soldiers all make an appearance in the articles, sometimes explicit and sometimes as in-jokes for which outsiders would not have the key. Shelling (whether from the enemy or one's own side): is referred to all through the magazine. There are occasional small ads purportedly from Minnie (German trench mortar) to Flying Pig (British ditto) and various poems complaining about, or apologising for, incidents where British guns shelled their own lines. Sex: the collections of pornography known to the Division as \\"The Munque Art Gallery\\" and \\"Kirschner's\\" are frequently mentioned and occasionally advertised, as are the local brothels: the Fancies, the Poplar tree and Plug Street. Drink: the continued supply of rum and whisky was a prime concern for all at the front. In one serial story, Narpoo Rum, a certain 'Herlock Shomes' spent five issues tracking rum-thieves round Hooge. Brief references also turn up to panic buying of supplies by unnamed individuals in the Division after rumours of a whisky drought. Rats: these bred in enormous numbers in the trenches, chiefly fed on corpses but with an eye for anything left in a dugout. One poem in the paper describes how a rat and his wife opened a tin of sardines, ate the contents then sealed the tin back up for the author to find. =Articles= The reality of life in the trenches rarely breaks through what the editor termed the paper's 'hysterical hilarity' but when it does, the gallows humour is clear and may appear callous to modern eyes. One example is a quote from an article in a British national newspaper about a bungled trench-raid, followed by a sharp comment from the editor of the Wipers Times: > \\"...They climbed into the trench and surprised the sentry, but unfortunately > the revolver which was held to his head missed fire. Attempts were made to > throttle him quietly, but he succeeded in raising the alarm, and had to be > killed.\\" This we consider real bad luck for the sentry after the previous > heroic efforts to keep him alive. Another such, from the column \\"Verbatim Extracts from Intelligence Summaries\\" reads as follows: > \\"At 10 p.m. the \\"Flying Pig\\" dropped a round in our front line at X 9 D 5 2. > The trench was completely wreckedthe crater formed being 14 feet deep and > 25 feet across. It is consoling to think that over 40 rounds have been fired > from this gun into the enemy trenches during the last week.\\" (Very consoling > to the P.B.I.) Even the weather wasn't immune to it, if you wanted to lay odds on the forecasts: > 5 to 1 Mist 11 to 2 East Wind or Frost 8 to 1 Chlorine. =Poetry= Much of the copy submitted by soldiers of the Division was poetry. Some was good, some was doggerel and occasional pieces were excellent: but not all was welcome. The fourth issue contained this notice from the editor: > We regret to announce that an insidious disease is affecting the Division, > and the result is a hurricane of poetry. Subalterns have been seen with a > notebook in one hand, and bombs in the other absently walking near the wire > in deep communication with their muse. Even Quartermasters with \\"books, > note, one\\" and \\"pencil, copying\\" break into song while arguing the point re > \\"boots. gum, thigh\\". The Editor would be obliged if a few of the poets would > break into prose as the paper cannot live by poems alone. Nonetheless, much of the space in the paper was taken up by poems. Two typical examples are given below. > Realizing Men must laugh, Some Wise Man devised the Staff : Dressed them up > in little dabs Of rich variegated tabs : Taught them how to win the War On > A.F.Z. 354 : Let them lead the Simple Life Far from all our vulgar strife : > Nightly gave them downy beds For their weary, aching heads : Lest their > relatives might grieve Often, often gave them leave, Decorations too, galore > : What on earth could man wish more? Yet, alas, or so says Rumour, He forgot > a sense of Humour! The world wasn't made in a day, And Eve didn't ride on a > bus, But most of the world's in a sandbag, The rest of its plastered on us. =Miscellanea= The paper is sprinkled with small paragraphs and half-column articles such as \\"People We Take Our Hats Off To\\" (frequently the French), \\"Things We Want to Know\\", \\"Answers to Correspondents\\" and small ads. Some were obviously spoofs: > LONELY PRESIDENT wishes correspond with anyone. Can write charming note. Has > corresponded with most of the crowned heads of Europe.- Write > \\"Dignitas,\\"Washington, U.S.A. > To Subaltern: Yes, every junior officer may carry a F.M.'s baton in his > knapsack, but we think you'll discard that to make room for an extra pair of > socks before very long. > TO LET-;Fine freehold estate in salubrious neighbourhood. Terms moderate. > Owner going east shortly.-;Apply Bosch and Co., Messines. While others were not for outsiders: > Things We Want To Know The name of the celebrated infantry officer who > appears daily in the trenches disguised as a Xmas tree.

Whether > a certain officer is shortly publishing a little song entitled \\"Why was I so > careless with the boots.\\" To Troubled.-;Certainly think you have just > complaint against people in the next dugout, and if you care to take the > matter further there is no doubt you will get damages.

Frequently used alternative terms are leg cuffs, (leg/ankle) shackles, footcuffs, fetters or leg irons. The term \\"fetter\\" shares a root with the word \\"foot\\". Shackles are typically used on prisoners and slaves. Leg shackles also are used for chain gangs to keep them together. Chain Gang Street Sweepers, 1909 Metaphorically, a fetter may be anything that restricts or restrains in any way, hence the word \\"unfettered\\".  History  Standard type legcuffs made in Taiwan The earliest fetters found in archaeological excavations date from the prehistoric age and are mostly of the puzzle lock type. Fetters are also referenced in ancient times in the Bible (, , ) Heavy legcuffs from China, including a metal plate to protect the keyhole from collecting dust or being tampered with Roman times already see a variety of restraint types. Some early versions of cup lock shackles can already be found. These were widely used in medieval times but their use declined when mass production made the manufacture of locks built into restraints affordable. Simple fetter types continue to be used like puzzle lock shackles as the typical slave iron or irons riveted shut for prisoners being transported to overseas prison camps. The first built-in locks often were of a simple screw-type but soon developed into the \\"Darby\\" type. In Europe these continued to be used into the middle of the 20th century, whereas in the U.S. from the late 19th century onwards many new designs were invented and produced before handcuffs and leg irons of the Peerless type became the standard several decades ago. One type of shackle, called an \\"Oregon Boot\\" or \\"Gardner Shackle\\", was patented by Oregon State Penitentiary Warden J.C. Gardner in 1866. The shackle consisted of an iron band of varying weights that was locked around one of prisoners ankles that was supported by braces which went down and under the prisoners foot. The shackle's weight hobbled the prisoners movements to prevent escape and long term use would cause severe injury to the wearer. Use of this type of shackle was ended by the mid-20th century.  Controversial use  Wooden legcuff at a museum, Sri Lanka In comparison to handcuffs the wearing of leg irons may be found less restrictive. Thus the prison authorities in several countries deem their long- term use acceptable. In order to avoid condoning this disputed practice, the countries of the European Union have banned exporting leg irons into non-EU countries.Civilising the torture trade, by Steve Wright, The Guardian, Thursday March 13, 2003COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1236/2005 of 27 June 2005, concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment The countries that continue to make prisoners wear fetters long-term now tend to manufacture their own restraints.

Rankine was born in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales and first attended Chester Grammar School and in 1937 went to study English Literature and Experimental Psychology at the University of Manchester, where he was a friend of Anthony Burgess (mentioned in Little Wilson and Big God, AB's autobiography). We know little of his life until 1966, when his first short stories and novels were published while he was in his mid-forties. The novels have a very 1960s and 1970s feel to them. One theme he worked with was that of a shorter life span, possibly borrowed from William F. Nolan's Logan's Run, but while the background and theme seemed similar, The Resurrection of Roger Diment took the concept in a totally different direction.

History Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis started working together in the early 1970s at the Architectural Association, the London-based architecture school, where Koolhaas was a student and Zenghelis an instructor. Their first major project was the utopian/dystopian project Exodus, or the Voluntary Prisoners of Architecture (1972). This project proposed a linear structure, cutting through London like a knife. Other projects included City of the Captive Globe (1974), Hotel Sphinx (1975), New Welfare Island/Welfare Palace Hotel (1975‚Äì76), Roosevelt Island Redevelopment (1975) ‚Äì all \\"paper\\" projects that were not (intended to be) built, and all located in Manhattan, the subject of Koolhaas's book Delirious New York, A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan (1975). The founding of OMA coincided with the firm's entry in the architectural design competition for a new Dutch parliament building in The Hague in 1978, with Zaha Hadid. OMA was one of the first-prize winners (among some 10 others), and the project was widely discussed and published. The commission, however, was given to an architect who did not participate in the competition. The entry for the Dutch parliament competition was the first of a series of controversial and successful international competition entries by OMA in the 1980s that were not built by OMA. =OMA in the 1980s= OMA's first major commissions were The Netherlands Dance Theatre (1981) in The Hague and IJ-Plein Urban planning (1981‚Äì1988) in Amsterdam. Due to change of location a second design for the Dance Theater was made in 1984. Once completed in 1987, the building received international attention. Although full of \\"first mistakes\\", the Dance Theater is the first realized design in which the ideas of Rem Koolhaas were made apparent. IJ-plein is located at Amsterdam's IJ, a river that serves as the city's waterfront, opposite the city center. The master plan consists of 1,300 dwellings and several facilities. OMA designed the school, the community center, and two blocks of housing. A few other designs were realized in the 1980s: a police station in Almere (1982‚Äì1985), a bus station in Rotterdam (1985‚Äì1987, demolished in 2005), Byzantium apartment block in Amsterdam (1985‚Äì1991) and Checkpoint Charlie Housing in Berlin (1984‚Äì1990). Two houses were built in this period; the first house was a duo of patio villas (1985‚Äì1988) in the style of Mies van der Rohe, inserted in a dike in Rotterdam. The second ‚Äì arguably the most full-grown design of OMA until that date ‚Äì was Villa Dall'Ava in Paris (1984‚Äì1991). The client, according to Koolhaas, asked for a \\"masterpiece\\". He wanted a glass house. She wanted a swimming pool on the roof. So many delays plagued the house that it \\"became a record of our own (OMA's) growing up\\". Several studies were made during the late 1970s and 1980s: Study for the renovation of a panopticon prison in Arnhem in 1979, Boompjes tower slab in Rotterdam (1979), Housing for Berlin IBA (1980, not realised, and the reason OMA would not design anything in Berlin anymore in the 20th century, the Dutch Embassy Building being the comeback), master plan for a world exhibition in Paris (1983). Much more important however were the competition entries OMA designed in this period. They gained the office international fame (but not one design was actually built). =OMA in the 1990s= In the 1990s OMA gained renown through a series of groundbreaking entries in major competitions: e.g., Tres Grande Biblioth√®que and Two Libraries for Jussieu University, Paris, France (1993). During these years OMA also realized ambitious projects, ranging from private residences to large scale urban plans: Villa dall‚ÄôAva, Paris, France (1991), Nexus Housing, Fukuoka, Japan (1991), the Kunsthal, Rotterdam (1992). The Euralille (1994), a 70-hectare business and civic center in Lille, northern France comprising the European hub for high-speed trains, transformed a once dormant center of more than 50 million inhabitants into a site offering connectivity, and a range of contemporary activities. In 1999 OMA completed the Maison √† Bordeaux, a villa for a client in the hills outside Bordeaux, France. The villa's most striking feature is a platform in the very center of the house that moves freely between the three floors and allowed the client to move with his wheelchair on all three levels of the villa. The design was conceived in collaboration with engineer Cecil Balmond. =OMA in the 21st century= OMA's recently completed projects include the Viktor & Rolf Store in London (2011), Edouard Malingue Gallery in Hong Kong (2010), Prada Transformer, a rotating multi-use pavilion in Seoul (2009), the Zeche Zollverein Historical Museum and master plan in Essen (2006), the Seoul National University Museum of Art (2005), the much acclaimed Casa da M√∫sica in Porto (2005), the Prada Epicenter in Los Angeles (2004), the Seattle Central Library (2004), the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art (2004), the Netherlands Embassy in Berlin (2003) and the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago (2003). OMA was awarded the contract for the Seattle Central Library, completed in 2005, despite not having been on the list of firms originally invited to submit designs. Former Seattle resident Joshua Prince-Ramus, a partner, heard from his mother about the meeting for interested firms at the last minute and flew in from the Netherlands. This 11-story glass and steel building is a striking addition to the Seattle cityscape. In Asia OMA recently completed the massive Central China Television Headquarters building in Beijing, and the new building for the Shenzhen Stock Exchange is currently under construction. In January 2009 OMA won the competition to build a performing arts centre in Taipei and in June 2009 the office won the competition to design \\"Crystal Island\\", a transport and cultural hub in the centre of Shenzhen. In October 2011, the Barbican Art Gallery launched their exhibition \\"OMA/Progress\\", the first major presentation of OMA's work in the UK, curated by Belgium-based creative collective Rotor. OMA (and Rem Koolhaas) are well known for controversial projects such as the proposal to adapt part of the Museum of Modern Art into a promotional space titled MoMa Inc. Organization =Leadership= OMA's leadership is organized as a collaborative partnership. OMA's current partners are Rem Koolhaas, Ellen van Loon, Reinier de Graaf, Shohei Shigematsu, Iyad Alsaka, David Gianotten, Chris van Duijn, Ippolito Pestellini Laparelli and Jason Long. =Offices= OMA maintains offices in Rotterdam, New York, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Doha. * OMA Rotterdam ‚Äî Projects include construction of the new headquarters for Rothschild Bank in London and De Rotterdam, the largest building in the Netherlands; design development of Stadskantoor, a new city hall building in Rotterdam; the Biblioth√®que Municipales √† Vocation R√©gionale in Caen; Maggie's Centre for cancer care in Glasgow; and the Cordoba Congress Center in Spain (later put on hold). The office is also working on several projects in the Middle East including three buildings for Education City in Qatar. * OMA New York ‚Äî Projects include a 550-foot residential tower in San Francisco, and now under construction is a new building for the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec. In 2011, the office completed Milstein Hall, a new building for the College of Architecture, Art and Planning at Cornell University. * OMA Beijing ‚Äî Projects include the office's largest project to date, the 575,000 m2 China Central Television Headquarters (CCTV) and Television Cultural Center (TVCC), in Beijing. Other projects in development include a residential tower and residential master plan in Singapore. * OMA Hong Kong ‚Äî Projects include the new Chu Hai College campus in Hong Kong, construction of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and design development of the Taipei Performing Arts Centre. =AMO= In 1998 Koolhaas founded AMO, a think tank within OMA dedicated to producing non-architectural work including exhibitions, branding campaigns, publishing, and energy planning. AMO has produced exhibitions at the Venice Biennale (on the Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg) and Venice Architecture Biennale (on the development of the Gulf, and, in 2010, on preservation), and guest-edited issues of the magazines Wired and Domus. AMO has produced work for Universal Studios, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Harvard University, Cond√© Nast, Heineken, and IKEA. AMO projects also include the development of in-store technology for Prada, a strategy for the future of Volkswagen, a strategy for TMRW, new organic fast food chain, work for Platform 21, new design institute in Amsterdam, a curatorial master plan for the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and Roadmap 2050: A Practical Guide to a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Europe. In 2008 AMO curated the exhibition \\"Dubai Next\\" at the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, and was one of the editors on the book Al Manakh, which details the rapid transformation of the Gulf region. In 2010 in collaboration with Archis and Think Tank, AMO made the follow-up, Al Manakh 2\\\\. Notable works =Seattle Central Library= In 1999 OMA won a competition to design a new central library for the city of Seattle. The Seattle Central Library was completed and opened to the public on May 23, 2004. In 2005, the library earned a national American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture. The building has also been described as \\"the most important new library to be built in a generation, and the most exhilarating\\" by New Yorker architecture critic Paul Goldberger. =Casa da M√∫sica, Porto= Completed in 2005, the new home of the National Orchestra of Porto, the Casa da M√∫sica, stands on a new public square in the historic Rotunda da Boavista. With a distinct faceted form, New York Times critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called it \\"a building whose intellectual ardor is matched by its sensual beauty\\". Inside, the elevated 1,300-seat Grand Auditorium, in the shape of a shoebox, has corrugated glass fa√ßades at either end that open the hall to the city and offer Porto itself as a dramatic backdrop for performances. As well as the Grand Auditorium, conceived as a simple mass hollowed out end-to-end from the solid form of the building, the Casa da M√∫sica also contains a smaller, more flexible performance space with no fixed seating. =Netherlands Embassy, Berlin= Winner of the 2005 Mies van der Rohe Award (the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture), OMA's Netherlands Embassy in Berlin is an isolated cube surrounded on two sides by a perimeter wall. The cube is punctured by a cantilevered meeting room and the visibility of the zig-zagging, interior path through the building. =Waterfront City, Dubai= In 2007 OMA was commissioned by Nakheel Properties to design a master plan for Waterfront City located on an artificial island off the Persian Gulf in Dubai. The design for Waterfront City will accommodate as many as 1.5 million people and cover an area of . OMA's urban plan for the city includes designs for five large buildings, including one spherical building that will be designed by OMA and contain a convention center, residences, hotel rooms, and retail stores. =European flag proposal= The Image of Europe, AMO's proposal for the European flag Following the signing of Treaties of Nice in May 2001, the then-President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, Koolhaas suggested a European flag, called the \\"Barcode\\". The Barcode unites the flags of the EU countries into a single, colorful symbol. In the current European flag, there is a fixed number of stars. In the Barcode, however, new Member States of the EU can be added without space constraints. Originally, the Barcode displayed 15 EU countries, and in 2004 the symbol was adapted to include ten new Member States. Since the time of the first drafts of the Barcode, it had never been officially used by commercial or political institutions, until it was officially used for the first time during the 2006 Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The logo has already been used for the EU information campaign which will also be continued during the Austrian EU Presidency. There was some initial uproar over the stripes of the Flag of Estonia, which were displayed incorrectly.

It is located in the city centre on the land bounded by St Ann's Square, Exchange Street, Market Street, Cross Street and Old Bank Street. The complex includes the Royal Exchange Theatre and the Royal Exchange Shopping Centre. The Royal Exchange was heavily damaged in the Manchester Blitz and in the 1996 Manchester bombing. The current building is the last of several buildings on the site used for commodities exchange, primarily but not exclusively of cotton and textiles. History, 1729 to 1973 The cotton industry in Lancashire was served by the cotton importers and brokers based in Liverpool who supplied Manchester and surrounding towns with the raw material needed to spin yarns and produce finished textiles. The Liverpool Cotton Exchange traded in imported raw cotton. In the 18th century the trade was part of the slave trade in which African slaves were transported to America where the cotton was grown and then exported to Liverpool where the raw cotton was sold. The raw cotton was processed in Manchester and the surrounding the cotton towns and Manchester Royal Exchange traded in spun yarn and finished goods throughout the world including Africa. Manchester's first exchange opened in 1729 but closed by the end of the century. As the cotton industry boomed, the need for a new exchange was recognised. The Manchester Exchange in 1835 The Royal Exchange in 1891 Thomas Harrison designed the new exchange of 1809 at the junction of Market Street and Exchange Street. Harrison designed the exchange in the Classical style. It had two storeys above a basement and was constructed in Runcorn stone. The cost, ¬£20,000, was paid for in advance by 400 members who bought ¬£50 shares and paid ¬£30 each to buy the site. The semi- circular north fa√ßade had fluted Doric columns. The exchange room where business was conducted covered 812 square yards. The ground floor also contained the members' library with more than 15,000 books. The basement housed a newsroom lit by a dome and plate glass windows, its ceiling was supported by a circle of Ionic pillars spaced fifteen feet from the walls. The first-floor dining-room was accessed by a geometrical staircase. The exchange opened to celebrate of the birthday of George III in 1809. It also contained other anterooms and offices. As the cotton trade continued to expand, larger premises were required and its extension was completed in 1849. The Exchange was run by a committee of notable Manchester industrialists. From 1855 to 1860 the committee was chaired by Edmund Buckley. The second exchange was replaced by a third designed by Mills & Murgatroyd, constructed between 1867 and 1874.Hartwell, p155. It was extended and modified by Bradshaw Gass & Hope between 1914 and 1931 to form the largest trading hall in England.Parkinson- Bailey p142. The trading hall had three domes and was double the size of the current hall. The colonnade parallel to Cross Street marked its centre. On trading days merchants and brokers struck deals which supported the jobs of tens of thousands of textile workers in Manchester and the surrounding towns. Manchester's cotton dealers and manufacturers trading from the Royal Exchange earned the city the name, Cottonopolis.Ashmore, p24. The exchange was seriously damaged during World War II when it took a direct hit from a bomb during a German air raid in the Manchester Blitz at Christmas in 1940. Its interior was rebuilt with a smaller trading area.Parkinson-Bailey, p169. The top stages of the clock tower, which had been destroyed, were replaced in a simpler form. Trading ceased in 1968, and the building was threatened with demolition.Parkinson-Bailey, p. 206 Architecture View towards the arches and theatre in the Great Central Hall The exchange has four storeys and two attic storeys built on a rectangular plan in Portland stone. It was designed in the Classical style. Its slate roof has three glazed domes and on the ground floor an arcade orientated east to west. It has a central atrium at first-floor level. The ground floor facade has channelled rusticated piers and the first, second and third floors have Corinthian columns with entablature and a modillioned cornice. The first attic storey has a balustraded parapet while the second attic storey has a mansard roof. At the north-west corner is a Baroque turret and there are domes over other corners. The west side has a massive round-headed entrance arch with wide steps up and the first and second floor windows have round-headed arches. The third floor and first attic storey have mullioned windows. Theatre The building remained empty until 1973 when it was used to house a theatre company (69 Theatre Company); the company performed in a temporary theatre but there were plans for a permanent theatre whose cost was then estimated at ¬£400,000.\\"Time and the Conways\\" at the Royal Exchange; December 1973 (programme) The Royal Exchange Theatre was founded in 1976 by five artistic directors: Michael Elliott, Caspar Wrede, Richard Negri, James Maxwell and Braham Murray. It was opened by Laurence Olivier on 15 September 1976.Programme for Happy Birthday, Sir Larry, 31 May 1987 In 1979, the artistic directorship was augmented by the appointment of Gregory Hersov. The Royal Exchange Arcade is a public route which passes under the building and contains retail units. The building was damaged on 15 June 1996 when an IRA bomb exploded in Corporation Street less than 50 yards away. The blast caused the dome to move, although the main structure was undamaged.Parkinson- Bailey, p257. That the adjacent St Ann's Church survived almost unscathed is probably due to the sheltering effect of the stone-built exchange. Repairs, which were undertaken by Birse Group, took over two years and cost ¬£32 million, a sum provided by the National Lottery. Whilst the exchange was rebuilt, the theatre company performed in Castlefield. The theatre was repaired and provided with a second performance space, the Studio, a bookshop, craft shop, restaurant, bars and rooms for corporate hospitality. The theatre's workshops, costume department and rehearsal rooms were moved to Swan Street. The refurbished theatre re-opened on 30 November 1998 by Prince Edward. The opening production, Stanley Houghton's Hindle Wakes was the play that should have opened the day the bomb was exploded. In 1999, the Royal Exchange was awarded 'Theatre of the Year' in the Barclays Theatre Awards, in recognition of its refurbishment and ambitious re-opening season. In 2014 Sarah Frankcom was appointed the sole artistic director. In January 2016 the Royal Exchange was awarded Regional Theatre of the Year by The Stage. In announcing the award The Stage said ‚Äì \\"This was the year that artistic director Sarah Frankcom really hit her stride at the Royal Exchange. The Manchester theatre in the round's output during 2015 delivered its best year in quite some time.\\" In January 2018 the Royal Exchange Young Company won the \\"School of the Year\\" award at The Stage Awards 2018. On 28 March 2019 the Royal Exchange announced that Sarah Frankcom was stepping down as Artistic Director of the Theatre to take up a new post as Director of the prestigious drama school LAMDA. On 8 July 2019 the theatre announced the appointment of Bryony Shanahan and Roy Alexander Weise as Joint Artistic Directors. =Theatres= The exterior of the circular theatre pod in the Great Central Hall The theatre features a seven-sided steel and glass module that squats within the building's Great Hall. It is a pure theatre in the round in which the stage area is surrounded on all sides, and above, by seating. Its unique design conceived by Richard Negri of the Wimbledon School of Art is intended to create a vivid and immediate relationship between actors and audiences. As the floor of the exchange was unable to take the weight of the theatre and its audience, the module is suspended from the four columns carrying the hall's central dome. Only the stage area and ground-level seating rest on the floor. The 150-ton theatre structure opened in 1976 at a cost of ¬£1 million amid some scepticism from Mancunians. The theatre can seat an audience of up to 800 on three levels, making it the largest theatre in the round in The World. There are 400 seats at ground level in a raked configuration, above which are two galleries, each with 150 seats set in two rows. The Studio is a 90-seat studio theatre with no fixed stage area and moveable seats, allowing for a variety of production styles (in the round, thrust etc.) It acts as host to a programme of visiting touring theatre companies, stand-up comedians and performances for young people.  Theatre programme  The Royal Exchange gives an average of 350 performances a year of nine professional theatre productions. Performances by the theatre company are occasionally given in London or from a 400-seat mobile theatre. The company performs a varied programme including classic theatre and revivals, contemporary drama and new writing. Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov have been the mainstay of its repertoire but the theatre has staged classics from other areas of the canon including the British premieres of La Ronde and The Prince of Homburg and revivals of The Lower Depths, Don Carlos and The Dybbuk. American work has also been important ‚Äì Tennessee Williams, O'Neill, Miller, August Wilson ‚Äì as has new writing, with the world premieres of The Dresser, Amongst Barbarians, A Wholly Healthy Glasgow and Port to its name. The Royal Exchange also presents visiting theatre companies in the Studio; folk, jazz and rock concerts; and discussions, readings and literary events. It engages children of all ages in drama activities and groups and has performances including these children and teens. Performances include \\"The Freedom Bird\\" and \\"The Boy Who Ran from the Sea\\".

The competition had its roots in two regional competitions called WRITE which attracted over 400 entries. The first two competitions resulted in three festivals of new writing which showcased eight new writers one of which, Nick Leather, became writer in residence. The theatre produced his script, All the Ordinary Angels, in October 2005. In 2006, 1,800 scripts were submitted for consideration. The winning entry was Ben Musgrave's Pretend You Have Big Buildings for which he received a prize of ¬£15,000 and his play was performed as part of the Manchester International Festival 2007. In 2008 the Exchange and Bruntwood ran a second competition. Judges included Brenda Blethyn, Michael Sheen, Roger Michell and actor/director Richard Wilson. The ¬£40,000 prize fund was split equally between Vivienne Franzmann for Mogadishu (main house and Lyric Hammersmith 2011), Fiona Peek for Salt (The Studio 2010), Andrew Sheridan for Winterlong (The Studio, 2011) and Naylah Ahmed for Butcher Boys. =Notable people= Directors The company has been run by a group of artistic directors since its inception.

It is formed by the confluence of the Afon Llia and the Afon Dringarth. It then flows south through the village of Ystradfellte to Pontneddfechan where it joins with the Nedd Fechan to become the River Neath (). The river derives its name from 'mellt' - the Welsh word for 'lightning' - after its tendency to rise and fall rapidly in response to heavy rainfall.  Underground section  The entire river runs underground for 1/2 km at Porth yr Ogof as it crosses the Carboniferous Limestone outcrop. It resurges at Pwll Glas. There are fifteen known entrances to the cave system. It is a complex maze of passageways, large and small, mostly developed along one or two major bedding planes. In extreme flood conditions the entire cave can flood to the roof. It is used heavily by school and adventure groups though sections of the cave can be hazardous for the unwary. There have been a number of fatalities over the years.  Waterfalls  Downstream of Porth-yr-Ogof and within 'Waterfall Country', the river flows over several falls, the most significant of which are Sgwd Clun-gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-gwyn and Sgwd y Pannwr - meaning 'white meadow fall', 'lower white meadow fall' and 'fall of the woollen washer (or fuller)'.http://www.breconbeacons.org  Habitat protection  The larger part of the river and its valley is protected both as a site of special scientific interest (Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Mellte a Moel Penderyn SSSI) and as a special area of conservation (Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC) in respect of the bryophyte flora which the deep and wooded nature of the valleys help to support.http://www.ccw.gov.uk  Industrial archaeology  The river provided the source of the power for the former gunpowder works at Pontneddfechan. The site is strung out along 3 km of the valley on both sides of the river. The remains of two weirs from which leats took water to drive a series of waterwheels and turbines can still be seen. All production on the site ceased in 1931.  Access  Much of the river is accessible to walkers with both public footpaths and concessionary paths running beside the river and giving access to the various falls. Brecon Beacons National Park Authority has worked in conjunction with the Forestry Commission and the Countryside Council for Wales, and subsequently with their successor body Natural Resources Wales, to ensure that the path erosion that has resulted from the popularity of this area is halted and reversed. A concessionary path runs through the gunpowder works site. Visitors can park at the pay and display car parks at Cwm Porth and the nearby Gwaun Hepste or else in Pontneddfechan.  Outdoor activities  The river and surrounding area is a hot spot for many different outdoor activities including the famous waterfall walks, caving, canyoning, gorge walking and white water kayaking. Providing a fun day out with any activity you choose to do, each with their own dangers there are many companies that operate in the valley running fun days out for all. This is a classic white water kayaking river with paddlers that have kayaked all over the world still regarding it as one of their favourites on the grade 4/5 white water.

They can be considered as esters of phosphoric acid. Like most functional groups organophosphates occur in a diverse range of forms, with important examples including key biomolecules such as DNA, RNA and ATP, as well as many insecticides, herbicides, nerve agents and flame retardants. OPEs have been widely used in various products as flame retardants, plasticizers, and performance additives to engine oil. The popularity of OPEs as flame retardants came as a substitution for the highly regulated brominated flame retardants. The low cost of production and compatibility to different polymers made OPEs to be widely used in different industries including textile, furniture, electronics as plasticizers and flame retardants. These compounds are added to the final product physically rather than by chemical bond. Due to this OPEs leak into the environment more readily through volatilization, leaching, as well as abrasion. OPEs have been detected in different environmental compartments such as air, dust, water, sediment, soil and biota samples at higher frequency and concentration. Chemistry =Synthesis= Various routes exist for the synthesis of organophosphates ;Esterification of phosphoric acid :OP(OH)3 \\\\+ ROH ‚Üí OP(OH)2(OR) + H2O :OP(OH)2(OR) + R'OH ‚Üí OP(OH)(OR)(OR') + H2O :OP(OH)(OR)(OR') + R\\"OH ‚Üí OP(OR)(OR')(OR\\") + H2O Alcohols can be detached from phosphate esters by hydrolysis, which is the reverse of the above reactions. For this reason, phosphate esters are common carriers of organic groups in biosynthesis. ;Oxidation of phosphite esters Organophosphites can be readily oxidised to give organophosphates :P(OR)3 \\\\+ [O] ‚Üí OP(OR)3 ; Alcoholysis of POCl3 Phosphorus oxychloride reacts readily with alcohols to give organophosphates :O=PCl3 \\\\+ 3 ROH ‚Üí O=P(OR)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl =Properties= The phosphate esters bearing OH groups are acidic and partially deprotonated in aqueous solution. For example, DNA and RNA are polymers of the type Polyphosphates also form esters; an important example of an ester of a polyphosphate is ATP, which is the monoester of triphosphoric acid (H5P3O10). OPEs have a central phosphate molecular group. In the case of organophosphate (OP) triesters, these are three ester bonds with alkyl or aromatic substituents. However, OP diesters are different from the triesters as one of the alkyl ester groups is replaced by a hydroxyl group, making OP diesters phosphoric acids. The wide variety of substitutes used in organophosphate esters results in great variations in physicochemical properties, varying from highly polar to very hydrolysis resistant characteristics. OPEs exhibit a wide range of octanol water partitioning coefficient where log Kow values range from -0.98 up to 10.6. The predominant OPEs used as flame retardants and plasticizers have a positive log Kow values ranging between 1.44-9.49 signifying hydrophobicity. Thus, owing to this hydrophobicity OPEs are presumptively bioaccumulated and biomagnified in aquatic ecosystems. Laboratory experiments had shown that the non-halogenated OPEs are prone to photolysis, while the chlorinated OPEs such as TCEP and TCPP, however, seemed to be resistant to degradation by sunlight. In nature thumb Guanitoxin is a naturally occurring organophosphate produced by cyanobacteria. The detection of OPEs in the air as far away as Antarctica at concentrations around 1 ng/m3 suggests their persistence in air, and their potential for long-range transport. OPEs were measured in high frequency in air and water and widely distributed in northern hemisphere. The chlorinated OPEs ( TCEP, TCIPP, TDCIPP) in urban sampling sites and non-halogenated like TBOEP in rural areas respectively were frequently measured in the environment across multiple sites. In the Laurentian Great Lakes total OPEs concentrations were found to be 2‚Äì3 orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of brominated flame retardants measured in similar air. Waters from rivers in Germany, Austria, and Spain have been consistently recorded for TBOEP and TCIPP at highest concentrations. From these studies, it is clear that OPE concentrations in both air and water samples are often orders of magnitude higher than other flame retardants, and that concentrations are largely dependent on sampling location, with higher concentrations in more urban, polluted locations. Pesticides Today, organophosphates make up about 50% of the killing agents in chemical pesticides. Organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), like some nerve agents, inhibit acetylcholinesterase, which is broadly essential for normal function in insects, but also in humans and many other animals. OPPs affect this enzyme in varied ways, a principal one being through irreversible covalent inhibition, and so create potentials for poisoning that vary in degree. The brain sends out neurotransmitters to the nerve endings in the body; organophosphates disrupt this process from occurring. This chemical, organophosphate works by disrupting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase break down the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, which sends out signals to other nerve endings in the body. For instance, parathion, one of the first OPPs commercialized, is many times more potent than malathion, an insecticide used in combating the Mediterranean fruit fly (Med- fly) and West Nile virus-transmitting mosquitoes. Human and animal exposure to them can be through ingestion of foods containing them, or via absorption through the skin or lungs. The human and animal toxicity of OPPs make them a societal health and environmental concern; the EPA banned most residential uses of organophosphates in 2001, but their agricultural use, as pesticides on fruits and vegetables, is still permitted, as is their use in mosquito abatement in public spaces such as parks. For instance, the most commonly used OPP in the U.S., malathion, sees wide application in agriculture, residential landscaping, and pest control programs (including mosquito control in public recreation areas). As of 2010, forty such OPPs were registered for use in the U.S., with at least 73 million pounds used in one time period in agricultural and residential settings. Commonly used organophosphates have included: * parathion * malathion * methyl parathion * chlorpyrifos * diazinon * dichlorvos * phosmet * fenitrothion * tetrachlorvinphos * azamethiphos * azinphos-methyl * terbufos Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to OPPs‚Äîe.g., in the case of farm workers‚Äîcan lead to health problems, including increased risks for cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancer. In the case of pregnant women, exposure can result in premature births. In addition, permanent damage to the brain‚Äôs chemical make-up, and changes in human behavior and emotion can occur to the fetus in pregnant women. Organophosphate pesticides degrade rapidly by hydrolysis on exposure to sunlight, air, and soil, although small amounts can be detected in food and drinking water. Organophosphates contaminate drinking water by moving through the soil to the ground water. When the pesticide degrades, it is broken down into several chemicals. Organophosphates degrade faster than the organochlorides. The greater acute toxicity of OPPs results in the elevated risk associated with this class of compounds (see the Toxicity section below). Nerve agents =History= Early pioneers in the field include Jean Louis Lassaigne (early 19th century) and Philippe de Clermont (1854). In 1932, German chemist Willy Lange and his graduate student, Gerde von Krueger, first described the cholinergic nervous system effects of organophosphates, noting a choking sensation and a dimming of vision after exposure on themselves, which they attributed to the esters themselves.Petroianu, G.A. 2010. Toxicity of phosphor esters: Willy Lange (1900‚Äì1976) and Gerda von Krueger (1907‚Äìafter 1970). College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, USA. Retrieved from: . This discovery later inspired German chemist Gerhard Schrader at company IG Farben in the 1930s to experiment with these compounds as insecticides. Their potential use as chemical warfare agents soon became apparent, and the Nazi government put Schrader in charge of developing organophosphate (in the broader sense of the word) nerve gases. Schrader's laboratory discovered the G series of weapons, which included Sarin, Tabun, and Soman. The Nazis produced large quantities of these compounds, though did not use them during World War II. British scientists experimented with a cholinergic organophosphate of their own, called diisopropylfluorophosphate, during the war. The British later produced VX nerve agent, which was many times more potent than the G series, in the early 1950s, almost 20 years after the Germans had discovered the G series. After World War II, American companies gained access to some information from Schrader's laboratory, and began synthesizing organophosphate pesticides in large quantities. Parathion was among the first marketed, followed by malathion and azinphosmethyl. The popularity of these insecticides increased after many of the organochlorine insecticides such as DDT, dieldrin, and heptachlor were banned in the 1970s. =Structural features= Effective organophosphates have the following structural features: * A terminal oxygen connected to phosphorus by a double bond, i.e. a phosphoryl group * Two lipophilic groups bonded to the phosphorus * A leaving group bonded to the phosphorus, often a halide Fine tuning Within these requirements, a large number of different lipophilic and leaving groups have been used. The variation of these groups is one means of fine tuning the toxicity of the compound. A good example of this chemistry are the P-thiocyanate compounds which use an aryl (or alkyl) group and an alkylamino group as the lipophilic groups. The thiocyanate is the leaving group.  Flame retardants  Flame retardants (FRs) are chemical that have been used on different consumer materials to prevent combustion and to delay the spread of fire after ignition. The increased demand to satisfy fire safety standards for flammability of plastic materials used in devices and appliances along with the strict regulation of brominated flame retardants has derived the high volume OPEs production and consumption. Most of flame retardants use the halogenated OPEs, and the effectiveness of the flame retardant increases with the increased number of halogenated substitute. OPEs are utilized as additive flame retardants which means the concentration of these flame retardants decreases with time as they readily leak into the environment. There are several mechanisms flame retardants use to prevent fire, however the most effective ones are the gas phase and the solid phase reactions. In the solid phase halogenated flame retardants produce char layer on burnig materials suffocating the combustion, as well as in the gas phase they remove H+ and OH- rdicals from the flammable gasses, by reaction with the Br and Cl atoms to further slowdown the burining process. Non-halogenated OPEs are effective mainly in the solid phase of burning materials. Upon exposure to heat the phosphorus compounds react to form a polymeric form of phosphorous acid. The acid causes a char layer that covers the burning material blocking it from contact with oxygen, which inturn slowdown the combustion reaction. Health effects =Poisoning= Many \\"organophosphates\\" are potent nerve agents, functioning by inhibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in nerve cells. They are one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, and are frequently intentionally used in suicides in agricultural areas. Organophosphosphate pesticides can be absorbed by all routes, including inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption. Their inhibitory effects on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme lead to a pathological excess of acetylcholine in the body. Their toxicity is not limited to the acute phase, however, and chronic effects have long been noted. Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (which is affected by organophosphate pesticides) are profoundly important in the brain's development, and many organophosphates have neurotoxic effects on developing organisms, even from low levels of exposure. Other organophosphates are not toxic, yet their main metabolites, such as their oxons, are. Treatment includes both a pralidoxime binder and an anticholinergic such as atropine. =Chronic toxicity= Repeated or prolonged exposure to organophosphates may result in the same effects as acute exposure including the delayed symptoms. Other effects reported in workers repeatedly exposed include impaired memory and concentration, disorientation, severe depressions, irritability, confusion, headache, speech difficulties, delayed reaction times, nightmares, sleepwalking, drowsiness, or insomnia. An influenza-like condition with headache, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, and malaise has also been reported. A recent study done by Madurai Kamaraj University in India have shown a direct correlation between usage of organophosphates and diabetes among Indian agricultural population. The physiological difference of OPEs in size and polarity greatly influences the physical and biochemical toxicity of the compound group. The chemical structures of OP triesters used as flame retardants and plasticizers are essentially similar to those of OP insecticides that target the nervous system of insects. Multiple toxicological studies have shown that OPEs such as TBOEP, TCIPP, TDCIPP, triethyl phosphate (TEP), and tris(methylphenyl)phosphate (TMPP) elicit effects on embryonic development, mRNA expression, thyroid hormones, circulating bile acid concentrations, and the neurological system in fish, birds, rodents, and/or humans. =Low-level exposure= Even at relatively low levels, organophosphates may be hazardous to human health. The pesticides act on acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme found in the brain chemicals closely related to those involved in ADHD, thus fetuses and young children, where brain development depends on a strict sequence of biological events, may be most at risk. They can be absorbed through the lungs or skin or by eating them on food. According to a 2008 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ‚Ä≥detectable‚Ä≥ traces of organophosphate were found in a representative sample of produce tested by the agency, 28% of frozen blueberries, 20% of celery, 27% of green beans, 17% of peaches, 8% of broccoli, and 25% of strawberries. =Cancer= The United States Environmental Protection Agency lists parathion as a possible human carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), found that some organophosphates may increase cancer risk. Tetrachlorvinphos and parathion were classified as \\"possibly carcinogenic\\", whereas malathion and diazinon were classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. =Health effects on children= A 2013 review of 27 studies on prenatal and early childhood exposures to organophosphate pesticides found all but one showed negative neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the ten studies that assessed prenatal exposure, \\"cognitive deficits (related to working memory) were found in children at age 7 years, behavioral deficits (related to attention) seen mainly in toddlers, and motor deficits (abnormal reflexes), seen mainly in neonates.\\" A systematic review of neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal and postnatal organophosphate pesticide exposure was done in 2014. The review found that \\"Most of the studies evaluating prenatal exposure observed a negative effect on mental development and an increase in attention problems in preschool and school children.\\" In the US the organophosphate phosmet was banned for use on household fruit trees, ornamentals, and domestic pets in 2001 as other pesticides became available for these uses. Many other uses of phosmet were still allowed, especially commercial ones. Affected populations According to the EPA, organophosphate use in 2004 accounts for 40% of all insecticide products used in the United States. Out of concerns for potential hazards of organophosphate exposure to child development, the EPA began phasing out forms of organophosphates used indoors in 2001. While it is used in forestry, urban, and public health spraying (mosquito abatement programs, etc.) as well, the general population has been observed to have low exposure. Thus, the primary affected population that faces exposure to organophosphates are farmworkers, especially those in countries that have fewer restrictions on its usage, such as in India. =Farmworkers in the United States= In the United States, migrant and seasonal farmworkers are the most susceptible to organophosphate exposure. Of the U.S. farmworker population, there are about 4.2 million seasonal or migrant men, women, and even children, 70% of which are born in Mexico and an overwhelming 90% majority of these are Latino. This almost homogenous racial aspect of employment in farm work in the United States highly suggests social, economic, and political factors undercurrents that would explain their vulnerability.Joan D. Flocks, e Environmental and Social Injustice of Farmworker Pesticide Exposure, 19 Geo. J. on Poverty L. & Pol'y 255 (2012). Half of the farmworker population in the United States do not have legal documentation and two thirds live in poverty, making it difficult to fully understand and document the characteristics of this population with relative certainty. Furthermore, the group faces linguistic barriers, with about 70% of the migrant seasonal farmworker population reporting that they cannot speak English well.Farmworker Health Factsheet. N.p.: National Center For Farmworker Health, Aug. 2012. PDF. In the United States, poverty and lack of documentation status puts migrant farmworkers in housing situations that make them far more likely to contract infectious or parasitic diseases and to suffer from chemical related ailments than the general U.S. population. Field workers who are exposed to pesticides continue to further expose their families in their residences, especially through contaminated clothing in which the residue settles as house dust. Increased rates of a full range of adverse birth outcomes result from high exposure to pesticides in a study of 500,000 births among farm workers in California's San Joaquin Valley. Economic, social, racial, and political barriers make passing policy and creating protective measures less likely to occur; in the context of their jobs, migrant seasonal farm workers are structurally vulnerable to exploitation and working conditions that are Occupational Factors not up to health standards if they are unable to find the necessary physical and social resources to protect themselves. The nature of their job may require constant exposure to toxins and pesticides and subjects them to increasingly extreme weather as climate change progresses. Thus, migrant farm work has been ranked conservatively as possibly the second most dangerous job in the country. Regulatory efforts Organophosphates (OPs) were among the most widely used insecticides until the 21st century. And until the mid 1990s, general pesticide regulation was dependent on the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) passed in 1938 and 1947, respectively. In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was bound by a pledge made to Congress to significantly reduce the amount of pesticides used in the United States, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, along with the Food and Drug Administration, joined the EPA in this commitment. Then, in 1996, The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) was signed into law to strengthen the regulation of pesticide in food and make regulation practices more consistent. One way that this strengthening was accomplished was through mandating aggregate and cumulative exposure risk assessments in derivative food tolerance levels. The EPA selected OPs as the first class of pesticides for assessing food tolerances because of their specific toxicity behavior as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Between 1996 and 1999, the use of OPs actually increased (despite the passing of the FQPA) from 75 million to 91 million pounds per year. However, this is mainly due to the cotton boll weevil eradication program through the U.S Department of Agriculture and the use of OPs eventually decreased to 46 million pounds per year by 2004. The residential use of OP pesticides may have declined more quickly, when compared to commercial use, largely due to the voluntary cancellation of chlorpyrifos and diazinon as approved pesticides for home use. The phaseout of both chlorpyrifos and diazinon for most residential uses was complete in 2005. Parathion (Ethyl) use is banned or restricted in 23 countries and its import is illegal in a total of 50 countries. Its use was banned in the U.S. in 2000 and it has not been used since 2003. In 2001, the EPA placed new restrictions on the use of the organophosphates phosmet and azinphos-methyl to increase protection of agricultural workers. The crop uses reported at that time as being phased out in four years included those for almonds, tart cherries, cotton, cranberries, peaches, pistachios, and walnuts. The crops with time-limited registration included apples/crab apples, blueberries, sweet cherries, pears, pine seed orchards, brussels sprouts, cane berries, and the use of azinphos-methyl by nurseries for quarantine requirements. The labeled uses of phosmet include alfalfa, orchard crops (e.g. almonds, walnuts, apples, cherries), blueberries, citrus, grapes, ornamental trees (not for use in residential, park, or recreational areas) and nonbearing fruit trees, Christmas trees and conifers (tree farms), potatoes, and peas. Azinphos-methyl has been banned in Europe since 2006. In May 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed the use of dichlorvos and proposed its continued sale, despite concerns over its safety and considerable evidence suggesting it is carcinogenic and harmful to the brain and nervous system, especially in children. Environmentalists charge that the latest decision was the product of backroom deals with industry and political interference. As of 2013, thirty-six types of organophosphates were registered for use in the United States. Organophosphates are currently used in a variety of environments (e.g. agriculture, gardens and veterinary practices), however, several notable OPs have been discontinued for use. This includes parathion, which is no longer registered for any use, and chlorpyrifos (as mentioned previously), which is no longer registered for home use. And again, other than for agricultural use, the OP diazinon has been banned in the U.S. See also * Activity-based protein profiling using organophosphate-containing activity-based probes * Pesticide toxicity to bees * Toxic oil syndrome * Cholinesterase inhibitor References External links *. * ATSDR Case Studies in Environmental Medicine: Cholinesterase Inhibitors, Including Pesticides and Chemical Warfare Nerve Agents U.S. Department of Health and Human Services * Organophosphates - an article by Frances M Dyro, MD * NYTimes: E.P.A.

United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States upholding the 1918 Amendment to the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it a criminal offense to urge the curtailment of production of the materials necessary to wage the war against Germany with intent to hinder the progress of the war. The 1918 Amendment is commonly referred to as if it were a separate Act, the Sedition Act of 1918. The defendants were convicted on the basis of two leaflets they printed and threw from windows of a building in New York City. One leaflet, signed \\"revolutionists\\", denounced the sending of American troops to Russia. The second leaflet, written in Yiddish, denounced the war and US efforts to impede the Russian Revolution. It advocated the cessation of the production of weapons to be used against Soviet Russia. The defendants were charged and convicted of inciting resistance to the war effort and urging curtailment of production of essential war material. They were sentenced to 10 and 20 years in prison. The Supreme Court ruled, 7‚Äì2, that the defendants' freedom of speech, protected by the First Amendment, was not violated.. Justice John Hessin Clarke in an opinion for the majority held that the defendants' intent to hinder war production could be inferred from their words, and that Congress had determined such expressions posed an imminent danger. Their conviction was accordingly warranted under the \\"clear-and-present-danger\\" standard, derived from the common law and announced in Schenck v. United States and companion cases earlier in 1919. Opinions for a unanimous Court in those cases were written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. In the Abrams case, however, Holmes dissented, rejecting the argument that the defendants' leaflets posed the \\"clear and present danger\\" that was true of the defendants in Schenck. In a powerful dissenting opinion joined by Justice Louis Brandeis, he said that the Abrams defendants lacked the specific intent to interfere with the war against Germany, and that they posed no actual risk. He went on to say that even if their acts could be shown to pose a risk of damaging war production, the draconian sentences imposed showed that they were being prosecuted not for their speech, but for their beliefs. Background of the case On August 12, 1919, Hyman Rosansky was arrested after throwing flyers out of a 4th-floor window of a hat factory located near the corner of Houston and Crosby, in lower Manhattan, New York.Szajkowsky, Z. (1971) Double Jeopardy - The Abrams Case of 1919. The American Jewish Archives XXIII(1), 6-32. Rosanky had received the flyers the night before while attending an anarchist meeting. Two different flyers were given to him, one in English, the other in Yiddish. The flyers were an acerbic protest against the Woodrow Wilson administration for interfering with the Russian Revolution in support of the Russian government. The flyers had been printed on or about June 15, 1919, in a basement rented by Jacob Abrams located at 1582 Madison Avenue. With Rosansky's help, police arrested six other Russian Jews: Mollie Steimer, Jacob Abrams, Hyman Lachowsky, Jacob Schwartz, Gabriel Prober, and Samuel Lipman. All had emigrated from Russia to the United States.Polenberg, R. (1987), Fighting Faiths: The Abrams Case, the Supreme Court, and Free Speech. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. The defendants were indicted for conspiring to violate the Espionage Act of 1917. Although trial had begun on October 10, 1919, actual trial proceedings were set to commence on October 15, 1919. On October 14, Jacob Schwartz died at Bellevue Hospital. The official cause of death was that he succumbed to the Spanish flu. The trial concluded on October 23, 1919, resulting in the following dispositions; (1) Gabriel Prober was acquitted, (2) Hyman Rosansky was convicted and sentenced to 3 years, (3) Jacob Abrams, Hyman Lachowsky, and Samuel Lipman were convicted and sentenced to 20 years and a $1,000 fine, and (4) Mollie Steimer was convicted and sentenced to 15 years and a $5,000 fine. The defendants appealed their convictions to the United States Supreme Court. Majority opinion Writing for the majority, Justice John Hessin Clarke asserted that the leaflets demonstrated an intent to hinder production of war material, and could not be characterized as simple expressions of political opinion. Quoting English translations of a leaflet written in Yiddish, Clark concluded: In answer to the claim that the defendants were concerned only with United States' intervention in Russia, he asserted that the leaflets The Court held that the leaflets' call for a general strike and the curtailment of munitions production violated the Sedition Act of 1918. Congress' determination that all such propaganda posed a danger to the war effort was sufficient to meet the standard set in Schenck v. United States for prosecution of attempted crimes, when the attempt was made through speech or writing. Holmes' argument, in dissent, that criminal prosecution required a showing of the specific intent to bring about the particular harm at which the statute was aimed, was rejected. Holmes's dissent Oliver Wendell Holmes In his dissent, Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that although the defendant's pamphlet called for a cessation of weapons production, it had not violated the Act of May 16, 1918. He wrote that the defendants did not have the requisite intent \\"to cripple or hinder the United States in the prosecution of the war\\" against Germany. The defendants were objecting only to the United States intervention in the Russian civil war. The defendants therefore lacked the specific intent to commit the crime of obstructing the war effort.Abrams, 250 U.S. at 626. Holmes's three earlier opinions for a unanimous Supreme Court concerned convictions under the 1918 Sedition Act, in the first of which, Schenck v. United States, he stated the famous \\"clear and present danger\\" standard: speech could be punished if it posed a clear and present danger of causing some harm that Congress had power to forbid.. The defendants in Schenck had mailed leaflets to men awaiting induction, urging them to resist the draft. The defendants did not deny that they intended this result. Since they could have been prosecuted for a crime if they accomplished the intended result, and there was a clear and present danger that they would, they could also be convicted of an attempt to commit the crime of obstructing the draft. The statute only applied to successful obstructions, but common-law precedents allowed prosecution in this case for an attempt. In his opinion, Holmes relied on the common law of \\"attempts,\\" and concluded without much discussion that an attempt might be made by words as by other means, the First Amendment notwithstanding. In his Abrams dissent, Holmes explained why some speech was protected by the Constitution, an explanation that was not called for in the earlier cases. His opinion for the Court in Schenck had been criticized by a scholar, Zechariah Chafee, who said the Court had explained only that attempts to commit crimes could be prosecuted. Holmes had young friends, Jewish immigrants who had themselves been attacked for their left-wing opinions, and he therefore may have felt more strongly about this case than its predecessors. In his dissent he now explained his views more fully. He did insist that the majority had departed from the standard adopted by a unanimous court that same year, since the Abrams defendants neither intended the forbidden result nor did their leaflets, written in Yiddish, threaten to cause a forbidden result. Holmes's dissent is now accepted as the better statement of the standard, but the Court's ruling that legislation could criminalize all seditious speech has also been upheld.Thomas Healey, The Great Dissent: How Holmes Changed His Mindand Changed the History of Freedom of Speech in America, 2013 Holmes's passionate, indignant opinion is often quoted: Holmes expressed himself more fully in this dissent than in his earlier opinions for a unanimous Court concerning the value of free expression, and the reasons for which it might be regulated. In his Abrams dissent, he added this explanation of his dissent. He had not asked the Court as a whole to endorse this larger expression in the earlier cases. Scholars have debated whether Holmes altered his views over the course of the weeks between the two sets of opinions.Albert J. Alschuler, Law Without Values (2000) pp.71-72. Holmes always maintained that he had adhered to the standard for punishing criminal attempts used in the earlier convictions, a standard based on long years as a common-law judge and scholar.Sheldon M. Novick, \\"The Unrevised Holmes and Freedom of Expression,\\" 1991 The Supreme Court Review, p. 303 (1992) Critics of his earlier \\"clear-and-present-danger\\" opinion have insisted that the Abrams dissent stands on a different footing, and is more protective. The objection may be based in part on a misunderstanding. In his Abrams dissent, Holmes first disposed of the argument that the facts in the case supported a conviction under the clear-and-present-danger standard, insisting that a criminal prosecution required proof of specific intent to commit the crime that was charged. He then went on to say, however, that even if the defendants' speech could be punished as an attempted crime, even if \\"enough can be squeezed from these poor and puny anonymities to turn the color of legal litmus paper,\\" the sentences of ten and twenty years, followed by deportation, showed that Abrams and his friends were prosecuted, not for their dangerous attempts, but for their beliefs. Holmes went on to challenge, not the Court's conclusion, but the Wilson Administration's prosecution of these defendants as an outrageous abuse of power. The \\"marketplace of ideas\\" Holmes insisted is the foundation of the constitutional system, not merely the First Amendment, and efforts to suppress opinions by force therefore contradict a fundamental principle of the Constitution. Holmes's friends and colleagues generally supported the decision in Schenck, but he encountered mild criticism from a young judge, Learned Hand, who had ruled differently in a similar case. In an article Zechariah Chafee complained that Holmes had failed in his opinions for the Court to define the contours of the privilege accorded to speech, holding only that criminal speech could be prosecuted. In his Abrams dissent, Holmes expanded his statement of the privilege accorded to honest expressions of opinions, on much the lines that Chafee had recommended, extending the analysis made in Schenck. Scholars have claimed that Holmes was influenced by Chafee and Hand, by Brandeis, or by others. These claims are stated in numerous articles, and summarized in a book by Richard Polenberg.Richard Polenberg, Fighting Faiths: The Abrams Case, the Supreme Court, and Free Speech, pp. 218‚Äì228 (1987) In 1989 Sheldon Novick's first full biography of Holmes suggested that the justice had been consistent in his decisions, as he claimed to have been.Sheldon Novick, \\"Preface: Honorable Justice at Twenty-Five,\\" in Honorable Justice: The Life of Oliver Wendell Holmes (1989, 2013). Building on the argument that Holmes changed his mind, scholars have claimed not only that the dissent in Abrams expressed a different and more liberal understanding of the First Amendment, but that the Abrams dissent set the standard for modern First Amendment jurisprudence.Thomas Healey, The Great Dissent, supra and sources cited there The Supreme Court has rejected this view, however. Subsequent jurisprudence Judge Learned Hand. The Abrams case has been kept alive by the scholarly dispute, but in recent years the Supreme Court has not cited either the majority opinion or Holmes' dissent as authority. The World War I sedition cases were overshadowed by new prosecutions under new statutes in World War II, the Cold War, the Vietnam War and the War on Terror. Learned Hand, a judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, contributed to the modern dislike of the \\"clear-and-present-danger\\" formula by citing it in an opinion upholding the convictions of the leaders of the Communist Party; his opinion was upheld by a bitterly divided Supreme Court in Dennis v. United States (1951),. and the Supreme Court subsequently avoided use of that phrase, replacing it with a similar formula in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1968), holding that speech can only be prosecuted as an attempt if it is intended to produce \\"imminent lawless action.\\". More recently, the Court has expressly rejected the reasoning of Holmes' Abrams dissent in two decisions. In Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010) the facts were similar to those in Abrams. Respondents had offered advice and other verbal assistance to organizations fighting established governments in Sri Lanka and Turkey, organizations that had been designated as terrorists, and were subject to prosecution for attempting to provide material support to terrorist organizations in violation of what is now the USA PATRIOT Act, section 2339B. The respondents argued, supported by three dissenting justices, that they lacked the specific intent to aid in terrorist acts, and therefore could not be prosecuted for a criminal attempt. The majority rejected this argument, however, and repeated without citing the majority opinion in Abrams, that Congress had the power to determine that all such expressive conduct posed a threat to national security.. In the same year, in Citizens United v. FEC dissenting judges made Holmes's argument that the Constitution broadly protects the \\"marketplace of ideas,\\" but the majority opinion brushed this aside, saying that freedom of expression was an individual right, not rooted in community interests, possessed by artificial as well as natural persons.. As the law now stands, it appears that neither the majority opinion in Abrams, with its reliance on the clear-and-present- danger formula, nor Holmes's dissent, are authoritative, and while Schenck appears to remain good law, it is now more common to cite Brandenburg v. Ohio for the standard to be applied in criminal prosecutions, except in cases involving national security in which Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project governs.

Early life and education Thomas ap Catesby Jones was born on 24 April 1790 in Westmoreland County, Virginia, to Catesby and Lettice (Turberville) Jones. The Jones family had originated in Wales and the middle name \\"ap Catesby\\" was a gesture to the patronymic surnames traditionally used in Wales; Thomas ap Catesby in Welsh means \\"Thomas, son of Catesby\\". Jones' father died on 23 September 1801 leaving the family destitute. Jones and his older brother, Roger were taken in by an uncle, Meriwether Jones of Richmond, Virginia. His mother died in December 1804 after a long illness leaving Jones an orphan at age 14. His uncle provided for his and his brother's education at Richmond Academy until the expense of private school became a burden. They studied with a private tutor after leaving the school.Smith, pp 6‚Äì8 Roger Jones would later become Adjutant General of the U.S. Army.Smith, p 45 War of 1812 Battle of Lake Borgne, Louisiana Jones was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy on 22 November 1805 at the age of fifteen, but owing to a lack of openings for midshipmen he was not ordered to active duty. He was furloughed home and advised to study geography, navigation, and surveying so that his chances of getting an active assignment would improve. After the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard Affair, the Navy mobilized its gunboats and Jones was ordered to report to Norfolk, Virginia, where he was assigned to gunboat No. 10, reporting the first week of August 1807.Smith, p 11 Thomas Jones received honors for bravery at the Battle of Lake Borgne (1814), Louisiana, delaying the British before the Battle of New Orleans.Smith, pp 29‚Äì32 Between wars In 1826, Commodore Jones while in command of the veteran sloop-of-war Peacock, signed treaties with the Kingdom of Tahiti and Hawaiian Kingdom On September 6, 1826, Jones signed a treaty with Queen regent P≈çmare Vahine on the behalf of the infant P≈çmare III and other chiefs of Tahiti.

Upon return to New York in October 1827, she was decommissioned and broken up in 1828. She was rebuilt as Peacock (1828), to serve as an exploration ship of the United States Exploring Expedition. Jones was to have commanded the expedition, but lack of funding delayed the expedition until 1838, by which time he had resigned the appointment.Stanton, pp 35-66 In May 1836, an act of Congress authorized the President to establish the five year United States Exploring Expedition \\"to the Pacific Ocean and South Seas\\", the first extra-continental American scientific exploration. Jones was appointed Commander of the Expedition. However, delays in Expedition departure dates, and various other disagreements, led to Jones (and certain scientists, including botanist Asa Gray) declining the position in December 1837. The position was subsequently offered to Charles Wilkes. From 1841 to 1844, Jones commanded the United States Pacific Squadron, and again from 1848 to 1850. In 1842, four years before the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Jones mistakenly thought that war had begun; he seized the California port of Monterey and held it for one day before returning control to Mexico.Stauffer, p 42 Hearing that British Captain Lord George Paulet had seized the Hawaiian Kingdom, he sailed there and arrived July 22, 1843. The king was restored July 31, and Jones tried to hasten peace by hosting all parties to dinner aboard his ship.Gapp, pp 101‚Äì121 In 1843, Jones returned a young deserter, Herman Melville, to the United States from the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were then known.

The interior of a silhouette is featureless, and the silhouette is usually presented on a light background, usually white, or none at all. The silhouette differs from an outline, which depicts the edge of an object in a linear form, while a silhouette appears as a solid shape. Silhouette images may be created in any visual artistic media, but were first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed. Cutting portraits, generally in profile, from black card became popular in the mid-18th century, though the term silhouette was seldom used until the early decades of the 19th century, and the tradition has continued under this name into the 21st century. They represented a cheap but effective alternative to the portrait miniature, and skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait, by far the most common style, in a matter of minutes, working purely by eye. Other artists, especially from about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could be equally quick. From its original graphic meaning, the term silhouette has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is backlit, and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as \\"in silhouette\\". Because a silhouette emphasises the outline, the word has also been used in the fields of fashion and fitness to describe the shape of a person's body or the shape created by wearing clothing of a particular style or period. Etymology and origins The word silhouette is derived from the name of √âtienne de Silhouette, a French finance minister who, in 1759, was forced by France's credit crisis during the Seven Years' War to impose severe economic demands upon the French people, particularly the wealthy.McLynn pp. 64‚Äì65 Because of de Silhouette's austere economies, his name became synonymous with anything done or made cheaply and so with these outline portraits.There is no mention of de Silhouette making silhouettes in his earliest record in 1834 edition Biographie universelle ou dictionnaire historique contenant la n√©crologie des hommes c√©l√®bres Volume 5. Furne, 1834. P. 2850 Prior to the advent of photography, silhouette profiles cut from black card were the cheapest way of recording a person's appearance.The family name Silhouette is a French form of a Basque surname, Ziloeta; Arnaud de Silhouette, √âtienne's father, was from Biarritz in the French Basque Country; this surname, whose Standard Basque or Batua form is Zuloeta, contains the suffix -eta \\"abundance of\\" and zilo, Batua zulo, \\"hole\\". The term silhouette, although existing from the 18th century, was not applied to the art of portrait-making until the 19th century. In the 18th and early 19th century, ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù or ‚Äúshades‚Äù as they were called were made by one of three methods: # painted on ivory, plaster, paper, card, or in reverse on glass; # ‚Äúhollow- cut‚Äù where the negative image was traced and then cut away from light colored paper which was then laid atop a dark background; and # ‚Äúcut and paste‚Äù where the figure was cut out of dark paper (usually free-hand) and then pasted onto a light background. History =Mythological origins= Attic Greek Black- figure Neck Amphora attributed to the Princeton Painter, ca. 550‚Äì540 BCE The silhouette is closely tied in mythology to the origins of art. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (circa 77‚Äì79 AD) Books XXXIV and XXXV, recounts the origin of painting. In Chapter 5 of Book XXXV, he writes, ‚ÄúWe have no certain knowledge as to the commencement of the art of painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our consideration. The Egyptians assert that it was invented among themselves, six thousand years before it passed into Greece; a vain boast, it is very evident. As to the Greeks, some say that it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth; but they all agree that it originated in tracing lines round the human shadow [...omnes umbra hominis lineis circumducta].‚Äú. In Chapter 15, he tells the story of Butades of Corinth: :: ‚ÄúButades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who invented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth which he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that he made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a young man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of his face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp [umbram ex facie eius ad lucernam in pariete lineis circumscripsit]. Upon seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery.‚Äù :: In accord with the myth, Greek Black-figure pottery painting,R. M. Cook (1976). Review of John Boardman 'Athenian Black Figure Vases: A Handbook.' The Classical Review (New Series), 26, pp 253-253. . also known as the black-figure style or black-figure ceramic (Greek, ŒºŒµŒªŒ±ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ±, melanomorpha, common between the 7th and 5th centuries BC) employs the silhouette and characteristic profile views of figures and objects on pottery forms. The pots themselves exhibit strong forms in outline that are indicators of their purpose, as well as being decorative.Trendall, A. D. (Arthur Dale Trendall) & National Gallery of Victoria (1966). Greek vases in the Felton Collection. Oxford University Press, Melbourne ; New York =Profile portraits= For the depiction of portraits, the profile image has marked advantage over a full-face image in many circumstances, because it depends strongly upon the proportions and relationship of the bony structures of the face (the forehead, nose and chin) making the image is clear and simple. For this reason profile portraits have been employed on coinage since the Roman era. The early Renaissance period saw a fashion for painted profile portraits and people such as Federico da Montefeltro and Ludovico Sforza were depicted in profile portraits. The profile portrait is strongly linked to the silhouette. Recent research at Stanford University indicates that where previous studies of face recognition have been based on frontal views, studies with silhouettes show humans are able to extract accurate information about gender and age from the silhouette alone.Science Daily, accessed November 2, 2008. This is an important concept for artists who design characters for visual media, because the silhouette is the most immediately recognisable and identifiable shape of the character.Good design lies in the foundation, accessed August 18, 2009. =Rise of popularity and development in the nineteenth century= A silhouette portrait can be painted or drawn. However, the traditional method of creating silhouette portraits is to cut them from lightweight black cardboard, and mount them on a pale (usually white) background. This was the work of specialist artists, often working out of booths at fairs or markets, whose trade competed with that of the more expensive miniaturists patronised by the wealthy. A traditional silhouette portrait artist would cut the likeness of a person, freehand, within a few minutes.Roving Artists Classic portraits Some modern silhouette artists also make silhouette portraits from photographs of people taken in profile.Custom Silhouette Pictures by Karl Johnson , accessed November 2, 2008. These profile images are often head and shoulder length (bust), but can also be full length.Silhouette Sarah The work of the physiognomist Johann Caspar Lavater, who used silhouettes to analyse facial types, is thought to have promoted the art.Lavater, accessed November 2, 2008. The 18th century silhouette artist August Edouart cut thousands of portraits in duplicate. His subjects included French and British nobility and US presidents. Much of his personal collection was lost in a shipwreck.August Edward, accessed November 2, 2008. In England, the best known silhouette artist, a painter not a cutter, was John Miers, who travelled and worked in different cities, but had a studio on the Strand in London.John Miers, accessed November 2, 2008, V&A; biography He advertised \\"three minute sittings\\",brereton.org.uk, Printed advertisement on back of a miniature and the cost might be as low as half a crown around 1800. Miers' superior products could be in grisaille, with delicate highlights added in gold or yellow, and some examples might be painted on various backings, including gesso, glass or ivory.museum \\"Silhouettes\\" The size was normally small, with many designed to fit into a locket, but otherwise a bust some 3 to 5 inches high was typical, with half- or full-length portraits proportionately larger. In America, silhouettes were highly popular from about 1790 to 1840. The physionotrace apparatus invented by Frenchman Gilles-Louis Chr√©tien in 1783-84 facilitated the production of silhouette portraits by deploying the mechanics of the pantograph to transmit the tracing (via an eyepiece) of the subject's profile silhouette to a needle moving on an engraving plate, from which multiple portrait copies could be printed.Freund, Gis√®le (1974), Photographie et soci√©t√©, √âditions du Seuil, p. 8-18, retrieved 18 April 2016Cromer 'Le secret du physoniotrace Bulletin de la soci√©t√© arch√©ologique, historique et artistique, ¬¥Le Vieux Papier,' 26th year, October 1925 The invention of photography signaled the end of the silhouette as a widespread form of portraiture. = Maintaining the tradition = The skill was not lost, and travelling silhouette artists continued to work at state fairs into the 20th century. The popularity of the silhouette portrait is being reborn in a new generation of people who appreciate the silhouette as a nostalgic way of capturing a significant occasion. In the United States and the UK silhouette artists have websites advertising their services at weddings and other such functions. In England there is an active group of silhouette artists.Tyneside silhouettist inspired family-success accessed February 4, 2012]Artist brings talent to The Woodlands shop, Houston Chronicle In Australia, S.

Other artists such as Douglas Carpenter produce silhouette images using pen and ink.Silhouette artist, accessed November 2, 2008. The silhouette in art, media and illustrations Since the late 18th century, silhouette artists have also made small scenes cut from card and mounted on a contrasting background like the portraits. These pictures, known as \\"paper cuts\\", were often, but not necessarily, silhouette images.Traditional European paper cuts are different in this regard to traditional Oriental paper cuts which are often made of several layers of brightly coloured and patterned paper, and have many formal decorative elements such as flower petals. Among 19th century artists to work in this way was the author Hans Christian Andersen.Hans Christian Andersen's Paper Cuts in the Royal Library, accessed November 2, 2008. The modern artist Robert Ryan creates intricate images by this technique, sometimes using them to produce silk-screen prints.Mister Rob Ryan, accessed November 2, 2008. In the late 19th and early 20th century several illustrators employed designs of similar appearance for making book illustrations. Silhouette pictures could easily be printed by blocks that were cheaper to produce and longer lasting than detailed black and white illustrations. Silhouette pictures sometimes appear in books of the early 20th century in conjunction with colour plates. (The colour plates were expensive to produce and each one was glued into the book by hand.) Illustrators who produced silhouette pictures at this time include Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson. In breaking with literal realism, artists of the Vorticist, Futurist and CubistRobbin, T. (2008). Shadows of reality: the fourth dimension in relativity, cubism, and modern thought. The Mathematical Intelligencer, 30(1), 74-75. movements employed the silhouette. Illustrators of the late 20th century to work in silhouette include Jan Pienkowski and Jan Ormerod. In the early 1970s, French artist Philippe Derome uses the black cut silhouette in his portraits of black people. In the 21st century, American artist Kara Walker develops this use of silhouette to present racial issues in confronting images.Knipe, P. (2002). Paper profiles: American portrait silhouettes. Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, 41(3), 203-223. =Shadow theatre= Originating in the orient with traditions such as the shadow theatres of Indonesia, the shadow play became a popular entertainment in Paris during the 18th and 19th century. In the Paris of the late 19th century, the shadow theatre was particularly associated with the cabaret Le Chat Noir where Henri Rivi√®re was the designer.Le Cabaret du Chat Noir (1881‚Äì1897) , Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris, 1992 =Movies= Since their pioneering use by Lotte Reiniger in silent films, silhouettes have been used for a variety of iconic, graphic, emotional, or conversely for distancing, effects in many movies. These include many of the opening credit sequences of the James Bond films. The opening sequence of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents features a silhouetted profile of Alfred Hitchcock stepping into a caricatured outline of himself, and in his movie Psycho the killer in the shower scene manifests as a terrifying silhouette. A scene from E.T. showing the central characters on a flying bicycle silhouetted against the full moon became a well-known movie poster. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 contains an animated sequence in silhouette illustrating a short story The Tale of the Three Brothers that is embedded in the film. The sequence was produced by Ben Hibon for Framestore, with artwork by Alexis Lidell. Silhouettes have also been used by recording artists in music videos. One example is the video for \\"Buttons\\" by The Pussycat Dolls, in which Nicole Scherzinger is seen in silhouette. Michael Jackson used his own distinctive silhouette both on stage and in videos such as \\"You Rock My World\\". Early iPod commercials portrayed silhouetted dancers wearing an iPod and earbuds. The cult television program, Mystery Science Theater 3000 features the three main characters of the series watching a movie as silhouettes at the bottom of the screen. = Architecture = The discipline of architecture that studies the shadows cast by or upon buildings is called Sciography. The play of shadows upon buildings was very much in vogue a thousand years ago as evidenced by the surviving examples of \\"mukarnas\\" art where the shadows of 3 dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance of mosques form pictures. As outright pictures were avoided in Islam, tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, \\"accidental\\" silhouettes are a creative alternative.google.no, Niƒüde Alaaddin Mosque where a Chiaroscuro drawing of a woman's face with crown and long hair appears at a specific time of the year.fotogaleri.haberler.com, Divriƒüi Great Mosque and Hospital with the silhouette of a praying man that appears over the entrance door of the mosque part and changes pose as the sun moves. =Photography= Silhouette of trees against the blue sky. Many photographers use the technique of photographing people, objects or landscape elements against the light, to achieve an image in silhouette. The background light might be natural, such as a cloudy or open sky, mist or fog, sunset or an open doorway (a technique known as contre-jour), or it might be contrived in a studio; see low-key lighting. Silhouetting requires that the exposure be adjusted so that there is no detail (underexposure) within the desired silhouette element, and overexposure for the background to render it bright; so a lighting ratio of 16:1 or greater is the ideal.

Burlington, MA, USA Focal Press =In graphic design= In media the term \\"to silhouette\\" is used for the process of separating or masking a portion of an image (such as the background) so that it does not show. Traditionally silhouettes have often been used in advertising, particularly in poster design, because they can be cheaply and effectively printed. Other uses The fashionable silhouette of 1900 =Fashion and fitness= The word \\"silhouette\\", because it implies the outline of a form, has been used in both fashion and fitness to describe the outline shape of the body from a particular angle, as altered by clothing in fashion usage, and clothed or unclothed where fitness is concerned, (e.g. a usage applied here by the Powerhouse Museum). Advertising for both these fields urges people, women in particular, to achieve a particular appearance, either by corsetry, diet or exercise. The term was in use in advertising by the early 20th century. Many gyms and fitness studios use the word \\"silhouette\\" either in their name or in their advertising.There are over 1,800,000 mentions of the word \\"silhouette\\" in conjunction with \\"fitness\\" online. There are many \\"Silhouette Fitness\\" studios and gymnasiums, e.g. in Halifax, in Bendigo , in Switzerland etc Historians of costume also use the term when describing the effect achieved by the clothes of different periods, so that they might describe and compare the silhouette of the 1860s with that of the other decades of the 19th century. A desirable silhouette could be influenced by many factors. The invention of crinoline steel influenced the silhouette of women in the 1850s and 60s. The posture of the Princess Alexandra influenced the silhouette of English women in the Edwardian period. See advertisement left. =Identification= Because silhouettes give a very clear image, they are often used in any field where the speedy identification of an object is necessary. Silhouettes have many practical applications. They are used for traffic signs (see pic below). They are used to identify towns or countries with silhouettes of monuments or maps. They are used to identify natural objects such as trees, insects and dinosaurs. They are used in forensic science.Forensic entomology , accessed November 3, 2008. =Journalism= For interviews, some individuals choose to be videotaped in silhouette to mask their facial features and protect their anonymity, typically accompanied by a dubbed voice. This is done when the individuals may be endangered if it is known they were interviewed. =Computer modelling= Computer modelling Computer vision researchers have been able to build computational models for perception that are capable of generating and reconstructing 3D shapes from single or multi-view depth maps or silhouettes = Military usage = Silhouette of an aircraft Silhouettes of ships, planes, tanks, and other military vehicles are used by soldiers and sailors for learning to identify different craft. =Firearm targets= File:Target-human silhouette.pngHuman silhouette targets are use for military, police and civilian firearms training.

He is depicted as a fighter and is one of the main characters in Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's first Dragonlance trilogy, the Dragonlance Chronicles. Caramon and his brother Raistlin Majere's relationship was explored in the NY Times Best Seller Twins Trilogy. Publication history Dragon magazine introduced some of the Heroes of the Lance in a series of short stories, as a preview to the Dragonlance story; \\"The Test of the Twins\\" in Dragon #83 (March 1984) was the first of these, and is a story about the twins Raistlin and Caramon. Character profile Caramon Majere was created by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman as one of several characters to be involved in an epic Advanced Dungeons & Dragons campaign which they had written and designed. Raistlin Majere harbors a secret hate for his twin's physical power and easygoing manner, and for the attention and comradeship it seems to earn him, as Raistlin's own appearance and secretive nature causes others to be mistrustful and apprehensive. Caramon, conversely, holds Raistlin in high regard and tries to protect him.  Early life  Caramon is the son of Gilon Majere and Rosamun Aelan Uth Matar, twin brother to Raistlin Majere, and half- brother to Kitiara Uth Matar. The son of a woodcutter, Caramon's childhood was a complicated one. Caramon (the first born), was strapping and healthy, while Raistlin was so sickly that the midwife feared he would die as an infant. Raistlin had to be nursed to health continuously by their half-sister, Kitiara. From an early age, Caramon's deliberate way of considering ideas earned him a reputation for mental dullness. His father, Gilon, died in an accident when Caramon was only sixteen years old. Soon after, his mother, Rosamun, went into a delusional trance and never came out. The novel Brothers Majere by Rose Estes reveals the origins of the love/hate relationship of Caramon and Raistlin; Caramon, distraught over his ailing mother, reluctantly allowed her to die. Caramon met Sturm Brightblade in his early teens; they did not get off to a good start. The two got into a fight because Sturm insulted Raistlin. Tasslehoff Burrfoot discovered the young boys and decided to \\"adopt\\" them. This is how Caramon met Flint Fireforge and Tanis Half-Elven. The six companions (seven with Kitiara) went on many treks as an entourage to Flint's business. Soon, though, the companions decided to separate to find some truth to the rumors of war. Raistlin had other plans. Raistlin was to take the Test of High Sorcery and Caramon accompanied him on this trip. During the Test, Raistlin killed an illusion of his twin, which Caramon witnessed. Their relationship has been strained since. The five years following this, the two brothers became mercenaries to learn how to combine magic and steel effectively and became a very lethal team in battle. Caramon was the strongest of the Heroes of the Lance, and a fearsome warrior. He is over 6 ft. tall and massively built. He was trained in a battle craft by his half-sister Kitiara, who later became a Dragon Highlord in Takhisis' dragonarmies. Although they were complete opposites, Caramon was never far from his twin Raistlin. Much of Caramon's experience in combat came from dealing with the charlatans and fakes whom Raistlin delighted in exposing and humiliating.  War of the Lance and beyond  Caramon was one of the heroes who brought the War of the Lance to an end and was instrumental in the defeat of Takhisis and her Dragonarmies. He helped to defeat the evil dragon Khisanth in Xak Tsaroth and to free the slaves captured by Verminaard of Nidus in Pax Tharkas. He shared in the dream that all the Heroes of the Lance endured when several of the heroes (including Caramon) entered the realm of Silvanesti and found themselves trapped in the nightmare of Lorac, Speaker of the Stars. Caramon was also a participant in the final battle at the Queen's temple in Neraka when she was finally banished from Krynn. After the battle was won, Caramon was confronted by his brother Raistlin, who had now turned to the Black Robes. Caramon offered to walk the path of evil with his brother, but Raistlin refused, and left Caramon alone for the first time in his life. Despite this, Caramon remains loyal to his brother, with a willingness to provide aid at any time. =Legends Trilogy= Time of the Twins, the first novel in the series, features the self-contained story of the fall and redemption of Caramon. He has become an alcoholic in the two years since the end of the first trilogy, and while Tasslehoff nudges Caramon into going after Raistlin, Caramon's gradual recovery is entirely his own achievement. After the War of the Lance Caramon married Tika Waylan and settled down to a quiet life in the town of Solace. However, without his brother, Caramon did not feel whole. At one point, Caramon wrote a heart-felt letter to his brother, which was returned to Caramon unopened, with the words \\"I have no brother\\" written on the outside of the envelope/scroll casing. Heartbroken, he soon turned to drinking to fill the emptiness. He becomes an overweight alcoholic and an embarrassment to his wife. His journey to redemption began when Caramon travelled back in time with the cleric, Lady Crysania and Tasslehoff Burrfoot to the city of Istar on a mission to reclaim Raistlin from evil. Caramon became a gladiator in the Istarian arena and became the man he had once been, physically if not yet emotionally. Caramon then travelled forward in time one hundred years with Crysania and Raistlin (masquerading as Fistandantilus) to participate in the Dwarfgate Wars in War of the Twins. Using a magical device, Caramon and Tasslehoff escaped that time period before a magical explosion could kill them and accidentally found themselves in an alternate future where Raistlin had succeeded in becoming a god, but had destroyed all life in the process. Caramon and Tasslehoff returned to the present at last where Caramon confronted his brother in the Abyss and told him what the future would be if his plans came to fruition. Raistlin realized his own mistake, and sacrificed his own life to correct his mistake and win his soul's peace. Caramon escaped with Crysania back into the real world, having finally found the peace he sought. =War of Souls= After his long journey, Caramon returned to Solace to be with his wife. Together, they had five children: Sturm Majere, Tanin Majere, Palin Majere, Laura Majere and Dezra Majere. Caramon also later became a grandfather to Ulin Majere and Linsha Majere, son and daughter of his son Palin. In the story \\"Kitiara's Son\\" by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, Caramon is visited in the night by a blue dragon-rider named Sara Dunstan who is the adoptive mother of Steel Brightblade, the son of Sturm and Kitiara (making him Caramon's half-nephew.) She begs Caramon to help turn Steel from evil before he becomes a full-fledged Knight of Takhisis. Together with Tanis Half-Elven, they kidnap Steel and tell him the truth about his father and his heroic sacrifice in the High Clerist's Tower on behalf of the Knights of Solamnia and the world at large. Although Steel is not dissuaded from joining the evil Knights, this experience indelibly changes him. He appears in a new adventure, \\"Dezra's Quest\\" Released later in 2000, with his daughter Dezra Majere. He dies in the year 38 SCDragons of a Fallen Sun after a heart attack upon the stairs of the Inn of the Last Home, hoping to see his brother. Tasslehoff Burrfoot had traveled forward in time to an alternate timeline to speak at Caramon's funeral, and told him that many people would be there and things were different. His soul joins the River of Souls where he is, at long last, reunited with his brother after Takhisis is defeated in the War of the Souls trilogy. Family tree Other media =Video games= Caramon appears as one of the player characters in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance. Caramon also appears in Champions of Krynn. =Miniature figures= Caramon was included in Ral Partha's Dragonlance Heroes boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for Dragon magazine felt that Ral Partha did a good job of matching their figures to the characters' descriptions in the books, and described his figure: \\"Caramon is leaning forward aggressively, as if fighting. He wields a long sword in his left hand with a shield on his right arm. A plate-mail suit covers his entire body, except for his full-length boots. His tunic, worn under his shoulder plates, flows naturally. The simple belts and buckles are clearly visible. Caramon wears a winged helmet, and his face bears a look of grim determination.\\" A second miniature of Caramon was released, this time on an individual blister pack, under Ral Partha's \\"Personalities\\" line. =Dragonlance movie= Rino Romano voiced Caramon Majere in the animated movie Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight. The 2002 winner of the American Library Association's Alex Award Mel Odom reviewed the film and stated \\"Caramon is simple-minded and protective of Raistlin\\" without further characterisation although stating the movie was a \\"lot of fun\\". Reception The character was popular enough for Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman to base the Twins Trilogy around Caramon's and Raistlin's relationship. The final book of the trilogy Test of the Twins appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for several weeks in 1986. Ian Hewitt, a staff reviewer from d20zines.com stated focus of the trilogy was \\"Caramon's heart-wrenching quest to save his brother if he can, but to ultimately stop him at any cost is the test that the twins must face\\" and awarded Test of the Twins an A+ rating. In Religious Concepts in Fantasy Literature, Nadine Wolf wrote that while Caramon is the physically stronger twin compared to Raistlin, it is the latter who \\"dominates their relationship\\". This is equivalent to what studies of real life twins has shown happens. Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, calls the twin brothers Caramon and Raistlin the series most compelling characters: \\"Caramon is a large, powerful, goodhearted, slightly childlike warrior; Raistlin is a sickly, complicated, mysterious, morally iffy magician. The dynamic feels like it's lifted straight from Thor and Loki, and that archetypal resonance is what Weis and Hickman are obviously shooting for. And almost entirely hit.\\" Lauren Davis of io9 notes that while \\"Caramon is physically strong, but has invested so much of his life and identity in protecting brother that he's blind to Raistlin's growing darkness.\\" Davis notes the flaws of the main characters, commenting that Caramon \\"isn't sure who he is without his brother‚Äîeven in a crowded field of characters. That's what lets us weep over doomed characters, shake our heads at foolish ones, rally at moments of true bravery and growth, and sigh over star-crossed lovers. Weis and Hickman may stuff their books with all a sorts of magical creatures and artifacts, but they clearly love their characters and never forget that it's the human(ish) stories that form the series' heart.\\"  References  Bibliography        Dragonlance characters Fictional twins Time travelers ","title":"Caramon Majere"},{"id":"959661","text":"Operation Swift was a military operation in the Vietnam War, launched by units of the U.S. 1st Marine Division to rescue two Marine companies which had been ambushed by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). The operation took place in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley, beginning on 4 September 1967. In the ensuing battles, 127 Marines and an estimated 600 PAVN were killed. Background The Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley is located along the border of Qu·∫£ng Nam and Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Provinces. During the Vietnam War it lay in the southern part of South Vietnam's I Corps. Populous and rice-rich, the valley was viewed as one of the keys to controlling South Vietnam's five northern provinces by the PAVN and by early 1967 at least two regiments of the PAVN 2nd Division had been infiltrated into the area. The Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley was also recognized as strategically important by the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). The 5th Marine Regiment was assigned to the valley in 1967 to support the outnumbered Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces there. In the spring and summer of 1967 the Marines launched Operations Union and Union II with the goal of sweeping the PAVN from the southern rim of the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley. Several bitter and costly battles forced the PAVN 2nd Division to cede control of area to the 5th Marines. Two Battalions of the 5th Marines continued to operate in the valley throughout the rest of the summer, but did not patrol aggressively and were not molested by the PAVN, who were regrouping. During the lull the PAVN 2nd Division rebuilt its strength to a force of three regular regiments and was reinforced by the Vietcong (VC) 1st Regiment, a full-time main force unit. In early August Major General Donn J. Robertson, commanding the 1st Marine Division, turned his attention to the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley following several major operations around Da Nang. In an attempt to draw the PAVN into another destructive confrontation Robertson launched Operation Cochise on 11 August. However the PAVN largely managed to avoid contact with the three Marine battalions tasked with the operation which ended on 28 August with only modest results. Operation Sweep operations were then initiated to shield the local populace from intimidation during upcoming elections. Operation Swift, intended to be the fourth and the last of the 1967 operations in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley, began unofficially on the morning of September 4 when Company D, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines was attacked before dawn by a superior PAVN force while in a night defensive perimeter next to the village of Dong Son. The 1st Battalion Commander, Lt.Colonel Peter Hilgartner sent 1/5 Marines's Company B, which was all he had at the time, to assist Company D. With Companies B and D heavily engaged, Companies K and M from the adjacent 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines were sent to relieve them. Ambushed and aggressively attacked, these two companies were also pinned down in separate enclaves by the early afternoon. During the fighting Corporal Larry Benjamin Nunez earned the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Squad Leader. Sergeant Lawrence Peters earned a posthumous Medal of Honor for leading his men in repulsing repeated attempts to overrun his position. Navy Chaplain Lieutenant Vincent Capodanno was also awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor for his efforts in pulling wounded men to safety in face of overwhelming enemy fire. Sergeant Thomas C. Panian was also awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism for organizing the defense of Company I, 3/5 Marines; and holding off subsequent attacks over 8 hours of combat. Marine artillery fire and Marine jet fighter-bombers prevented the Marine infantry companies from being overrun. A Marine A-6 silenced an anti-aircraft gun emplacement, allowing more air support against PAVN positions, and a fresh Marine company launched a dawn counterattack on 5 September forcing the PAVN to break contact. With all engaged companies now relieved, Colonel Stanley Davis, commanding the 5th Marines, ordered 1/5 and 3/5 to pursue the withdrawing PAVN, this officially began Operation Swift. A search of the battlefield found 130 PAVN bodies, while Marine losses were 54 killed and 104 wounded. In the early afternoon of 6 September, two battalions of the VC 1st Regiment attacked Company B, the lead company of the 1/5 Marines. Company B was isolated and nearly overrun, but held when Marine artillery rained tear gas around their position. Sergeant Rodney M. Davis, Platoon Guide of 2nd Platoon, Company B, purposely absorbed the force of a PAVN grenade to protect the lives of other Marines during that fight. Sergeant Davis was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for this action. The PAVN withdrew at 02:00 leaving 61 dead, while Marine losses were 35 killed and 92 wounded. The nearby 3/5 Marines was also heavily engaged a few hours later. Company I, dispatched to attack a hill held by the PAVN/VC, was isolated and nearly overrun by the VC 1st Regiment's previously uncommitted 3rd Battalion. Company K fought through the VC and relieved Company I, but the two companies were then found to have too many casualties to move. Two determined night assaults by the VC were repulsed, and Company M eventually fought through against weakening opposition as the VC withdrew. Vietcong losses were 88 dead, while Marine losses were 34 killed and 109 wounded. On the morning of 7 September, after a search of VC bodies revealed a map of the VC tactical locations, the Marines swept the area, uncovering a large supply cache. On 10 September Company H, 2/5 Marines discovered an unoccupied bunker system, when another Marine platoon moved through the same village several hours later, they were hit by intense fire from the bunker now occupied by a PAVN force. Company H, 2/5 Marines and Company M, 3/5 Marines moved to support the pinned down platoon and with air and artillery support overran the PAVN position. The bodies of 40 PAVN were discovered, Marine losses were 9 dead. Several of the dead Marines were found with their jammed M-16s broken open for cleaning. Also on 10 September the ARVN 37th Ranger Battalion encountered a PAVN force north of the Swift operational area. The Rangers lost 13 killed and 9 missing while the PAVN lost 70 killed. In the early morning of 12 September, two PAVN Companies attacked Company I, 3/5 Marines' night defensive position, the attack was repulsed with 35 PAVN killed and 4 captured. On the evening of 13 September the PAVN attacked the 37th Rangers again and additional ARVN units and 1/5 and 3/5 Marines were airlifted to support them. By dawn the PAVN disengaged leaving 49 dead while the Rangers has lost 15 killed. Aftermath The operation concluded on 15 September, by which time the PAVN 2nd Division and VC 1st Regiment had largely given up contesting the southern half of the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley. As Operation Swift concluded large U.S. Army units arrived in southern I Corps, allowing the 1st Marine Division to base a substantial force in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley on a permanent basis. The area remained quiet from then until the Marines turned all of southern I Corps over to the U.S. Army at the beginning of 1968. U.S. intelligence agencies later determined that the two PAVN/VC regiments that had been most active during Operation Swift were subsequently unfit for combat.

As such, he was the author of a major county history, The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent (1778-99). Life Hasted was born in Lombard Street, London, the son of Edward Hasted (1702-1740) of Sutton-at-Hone, near Dartford, Kent by his wife, Ann Tyler. His grandfather, Joseph Hasted (1662-1732), had been employed as chief painter at the Royal Navy's Chatham dockyard, but he was also a skilled financier, and amassed a considerable private estate and income. Hasted's father, Edward, became a wealthy barrister, and the young Edward Hasted was educated at Darent (1737-40), The King's School, Rochester (1740-44). From there, he went to Eton College (1744-48), and a school in Esher (1748-50). After completing his education, he was a student for a short time at Lincolns Inn, although he was not called to the bar. Hasted returned to his parents' home in Sutton-at-Hone, and, in July 1755, married Anne, Dorman, the daughter of a neighbour. In May 1766, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Hasted acquired The Knights Hospitaller's manor house of St. John's Jerusalem; and it was here that he wrote his magnum opus. He attended the local church regularly, and also sat on the West Kent Quarter Sessions bench at Maidstone. The couple had two daughters and five sons, one of whom was also named Edward. In 1770, they moved to Canterbury, where they lived until 1789, by which time his finances were in total confusion. Although he sold off some of his estates, he sank deeper into debt. In 1790, he left his wife Anne, and fled to France with another woman. There he remained until the war with Napoleon drove him back home and into debtors' prison for almost seven years. Released in 1802, Hasted lived in poverty for five years until he was given the Mastership of Lady Hungerford's Almshouse in Corsham, Wiltshire, by his friend William Bouverie, 1st Earl of Radnor. Hasted remained Master of the Almshouse from 1807 until his death in 1812, aged 79. Works The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent was first published in four folio volumes between 1778 and 1799. A second edition appeared in 12 octavo volumes between 1797 and 1801. It incorporated much new material, but also omitted many details from the first edition: it had been greatly revised by either one or two unidentified editors, and the extent to which it drew on materials collected by Hasted, or to which he was able to influence the work, remains unclear. A modern reprint of the second edition was published in 1972. Hasted also published a separate History of the Antient and Metropolitical City of Canterbury Civil and Ecclesiastical (1799).

Livvi-Karelian (Alternate names: Liygi, Livvi, Livvikovian, Olonets, Southern Olonetsian, Karelian; ) is a dialect of the Karelian language, which is a Finnic language of the Uralic family, spoken by Olonets Karelians (self-appellation livvi, livgilaizet), traditionally inhabiting the area between Ladoga and Onega lakes, northward of Svir River. The name \\"Olonets Karelians\\" is derived from the territory inhabited, Olonets Krai, named after the town of Olonets, named after the Olonka River. History Before World War II, Livvi-Karelian was spoken both in Russia and in Finland, in the easternmost part of Finnish Karelia. After Finland was forced to cede large parts of Karelia to the USSR after the war, the Finnish Livvi-Karelian population was resettled in Finland. Today there are still native speakers of Livvi-Karelian living scattered throughout Finland, but all areas in which Livvi-Karelian remain a community language are found in Russia. Speakers of Livvi-Karelian may be found mainly in Olonetsky, Pryazhinsky, Pitkyarantsky, and partly Suoyarvsky districts of the Republic of Karelia.\\"Karelian Language\\", at the website about livvic culture Livvi-Karelian long remained relatively uninfluenced by the Russian language despite the large influx of Russians following the founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The Derby Hall was built in the late 1840s at the instigation of Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. It was designed by Sydney Smirke, an architect best known today for his work on the circular reading room at the British Museum. The building has a central Venetian window and a pedimented portico with four attached columns. It was originally the central part of a larger development that included the Derby Hotel on the left, and the Athenaeum on the right (both also designed by Smirke). These other two buildings were demolished in 1965 and 1971, respectively. Construction of the building began at Christmas 1848 and was completed in October 1850.The Manchester Courier, and Lancashire General Advertiser, Saturday 5 October 1850, p. 5 The hall was opened on 6 November 1850 with a concert which was attended by 600 people. The building was originally known as the Public Rooms, although it quickly became known as the Town Hall. At its opening, it contained a magistrate's court, a police station, the Earl of Derby's estate offices and a large assembly room. Stanley hoped the building would become the meeting place for Bury's council; however, owing to a disagreement between the earl and the local authority, it was not initially used for that purpose. After the First World War the council acquired the building from the Stanley family and used it as a council building. The council moved to the new Town Hall on Knowsley Street in 1954 and, since 1979, the building has been operated by a registered charity called Bury Metropolitan Arts Association, which uses it as a theatre and concert venue known as The Met. One notable concert held in the building was by rock band Joy Division on 8 April 1980, which descended into a riot after some of the audience started throwing bottles at the stage. This was because Alan Hempstall of Crispy Ambulance and Simon Topping of A Certain Ratio filled in on vocals, since Joy Division's own lead singer Ian Curtis was recovering from an attempted suicide bid the previous day.

Early years Born in Petrograd, Ustvolskaya studied from 1937 to 1939 at the college attached to the Leningrad Conservatory (later renamed the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory). From 1947 till 1977 she taught composition at this college. In 1939 she entered Dmitri Shostakovich's composition class at the Conservatory as the only female student in his class. Her composition teacher said of her: Shostakovich sent some of his own as yet unfinished works to Ustvolskaya, attaching great value to her comments. Some of these pieces even contain quotations from his pupil's compositions; for example, he employed the second theme of the Finale of her clarinet trio throughout the Fifth String Quartet and in the Michelangelo Suite (no. 9). The intimate spiritual and artistic relationship between the two composers has been compared to that of Schoenberg and Webern. Ustvolskaya was a pupil of Shostakovich from 1939 to 1941 and from 1947 to 1948, but her works from the 1950s onwards retain little influence of his style. Until 1961 none of her true works were performed other than patriotic pieces written for official consumption. The middle of the 1960s witnessed greater tolerance for modernist music, and interest in Ustvolskaya began to grow ‚Äì the Leningrad Union of Composers organized in the 1970s evenings of her music, which invariably received high praise from listeners and critics. Ustvolskaya quickly became a cult figure, even though very few people outside of Leningrad and Moscow knew her. Widespread recognition came only after her music was performed in several concerts of the 1989 Holland Festival. Since then her music has been increasingly often programmed in the West. Style Ustvolskaya developed her own very particular style, of which she said, \\"There is no link whatsoever between my music and that of any other composer, living or dead.\\" Among its characteristics are: the use of repeated, homophonic blocks of sound, which prompted the Dutch critic Elmer Sch√∂nberger to call her \\"the lady with the hammer\\"; unusual combinations of instruments (such as eight double basses, piano and percussion in her Composition No. 2); considerable use of extreme dynamics (as in her Piano Sonata No. 6); the employment of groups of instruments to introduce tone clusters; sparse harmonic textures; and the use of piano or percussion to beat out regular unchanging rhythms (all of her acknowledged works use either piano or percussion; many use both). The music of Galina Ustvolskaya is not \\"avant-garde\\" in the commonly accepted sense of the term and for this reason was not openly censured in the USSR. However, she was accused of being unwilling to communicate and of \\"narrowness\\" and \\"obstinacy\\". It is only in the recent past that her critics have begun to realize that these supposed deficiencies are in fact the distinguishing qualities of her music. The composer Boris Tishchenko has aptly compared the \\"narrowness\\" of her style to the concentrated light of a laser beam that is capable of piercing metal. Galina Ustvolskaya's works of the 1940‚Äî1970s sometimes sound as if they had been written today. Her specific idealism is informed by an almost fanatical determination; this should be construed not only as a typically Russian trait, but also ‚Äì in terms of Dostoyevsky ‚Äì as a \\"Saint Petersburgian\\" one. Shostakovich wrote to her: All of Ustvolskaya's works are large-scaled in intent, no matter how long they are or how many players are involved. Ustvolskaya's music is largely based on tension and density. She proclaimed in the 1990s ‚ÄúThe tremendous power and aspiration to God, which are inherent in each composition, do not even allow to formally apply the term chamberness to them. Ustvolskaya considers her compositional technique to be completely new, individual and not amenable to theoretical analysis.‚Äù Religion All the symphonies have parts for solo voices, the latter four having religious texts, while the compositions have religious subtitles. The spiritual aspect of the compositions and symphonies invites a superficial comparison with her contemporary Sofia Gubaidulina, although unlike the latter Ustvolskaya was not a practising believer and these works are far from professions of Christian faith. The texts are either conventional invocations or, in the case of the fifth symphony, the Lord's Prayer. As Frans Lemaire has written, \\"Most of the time, the words present themselves as a murmured complaint or an insistent supplication, as opposed to the cosmic indifference of the music\\". In literature Ustvolskaya's relationship with Shostakovich from her time as a student through the 1950s is characterized in William T. Vollmann's National Book Award-winning historical fiction Europe Central. Legacy and remembrance Ustvolskaya died in Saint Petersburg. Her estate is managed by her husband of 43 years Konstantin Bagrenin (1941). Her manuscripts are stored in the archive of the Paul Sacher Stiftung since 1994. Even in the year of her centenary no memorial plaque was put on the house she had been living in for 38 years, not to speak of naming musical schools, streets or places after Ustvolskaya. The authorities ignore her name just like she ignored them in her lifetime. Works Ustvolskaya's oeuvre is small, with only 21 pieces in her characteristic style (i.e. excluding the public, Soviet-style works). *Concerto for piano, full string orchestra and timpani (1946) *Sonata for cello and piano (1946) (destroyed) *Piano Sonata No. 1 (1947) *The Dream of Stepan Razin (–°–æ–Ω –°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω–∞ –†–∞–∑–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äì Son Stepana Razina) Bylina for bass and symphony orchestra (Russian folk text, 1949) *Trio for clarinet, violin and piano (1949) *Piano Sonata No. 2 (1949) *Octet for two oboes, four violins, timpani and piano (1950) *Sinfonietta (1951) (destroyed) *Piano Sonata No. 3 (1952) *Violin Sonata (1952) *Twelve Preludes for piano (1953) *Symphony No. 1, for two boys' voices and orchestra (Text by Gianni Rodari, 1955) *Suite for orchestra (1955) *Piano Sonata No. 4 (1957) *Symphonic Poem No. 1 (1959) *Symphonic Poem No. 2 (1957) *Grand Duet for piano and cello (1959) *Duet for piano and violin (1964) *Composition No. 1 Dona Nobis Pacem, for piccolo, tuba and piano (1971) *Composition No. 2 Dies Irae, for eight double basses, piano and wooden cube (1973) *Composition No. 3 Benedictus, Qui Venit, for four flutes, four bassoons and piano (1975) *Symphony No. 2 - True and Eternal Bliss!, for male reciter and small orchestra (1979) *Symphony No. 3 - Jesus Messiah, Save Us!, for male reciter and small orchestra (1983) *Symphony No. 4 - Prayer, for contralto, piano, trumpet and tam-tam (1985/7) * Piano Sonata No. 5 (1986) * Piano Sonata No. 6 (1988) *Symphony No. 5 - Amen, for male reciter, oboe, trumpet, tuba, violin and wooden cube (1989/90) Her music is available from Hans Sikorski, Hamburg.

A one-off television film, co-produced with Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox Television, was screened on the Fox Network in the United States in 1996. Origins The title screen of the first episode of Doctor Who In March 1962, Eric Maschwitz, the Assistant and Adviser to the Controller of Programmes at BBC Television, asked Donald Wilson, the Head of the Script Department, to have his department's Survey Group prepare a study on the feasibility of the BBC producing a new science fiction television series.Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), p. 159. The report was prepared by staff members Alice Frick and Donald Bull, and delivered the following month, much to the commendation of Wilson, Maschwitz and the BBC's Assistant Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock.Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), p. 161. A follow-up report into specific ideas for the format of such a programme was commissioned, and delivered in July. Prepared by Frick with another Script Department staff member, John Braybon, this report recommended a series dealing with time travel as being an idea particularly worthy of development.Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), pp. 162 ‚Äì 164. In December, Canadian-born Sydney Newman arrived at BBC Television as the new Head of Drama. Newman was a science fiction fan who had overseen several such productions in his previous positions at ABC Television and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), p. 162. In March 1963, he was made aware by Baverstock ‚Äì now promoted to Controller of Programmes ‚Äì of a gap in the schedule on Saturday evenings between the sports showcase Grandstand and the pop music programme Juke Box Jury.Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), p. 166. Ideally, any programme scheduled here would appeal to children that had previously been accustomed to the timeslot, the teenaged audience of Juke Box Jury, and the adult sports fan audience of Grandstand.Howe, Stammers, Walker (1993), p. 3 Newman decided that a science fiction programme would be perfect to fill the gap, and enthusiastically took up the existing Script Department research, initiating several brainstorming sessions with Wilson, Braybon, Frick and another BBC staff writer, C. E. 'Bunny' Webber. Wilson and Webber contributed heavily to the formatting of the programme and its initial cast of regular characters,Richards, p. 13. and co- wrote the programme's first format document with Newman.Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), p. 182. Newman personally came up with the idea of a time machine larger on the inside than the outside and the idea of the central character, the mysterious \\"Doctor\\"; he also gave the series the name Doctor Who.Hugh David, an actor initially considered for the role of the Doctor and later a director on the programme, later claimed that Rex Tucker coined the title Doctor Who. Tucker himself claimed that it was Newman who had done so. Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), p. 173. Later in the year production was initiated and handed over to producer Verity Lambert and story editor David Whitaker to oversee, after a brief period when the show had been handled by a \\"caretaker\\" producer, Rex Tucker. Concerned about Lambert's relative lack of experience, Wilson appointed the experienced staff director Mervyn Pinfield as associate producer. Australian staff writer Anthony Coburn also contributed, penning the very first episode from a draft initially prepared by Webber, and coming up with the idea that the time machine, the TARDIS, should externally resemble a police box.Howe, Stammers, Walker. The Handbook (1994), p. 178. Doctor Who was originally intended to be an educational series, with the TARDIS taking the form of an object from that particular episode's time period (a column in Ancient Greece, a sarcophagus in Egypt, etc.). When the show's budget was calculated, however, it was discovered that it was prohibitively expensive to re-dress the TARDIS model for each episode; instead, the TARDIS's \\"Chameleon Circuit\\" was said to be malfunctioning, giving the prop its characteristic 'police-box' appearance. The series' theme music was written by film and television composer Ron Grainer (who would later go on to also compose the theme to The Prisoner, among others) in collaboration with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. While Grainer wrote the theme, it was Delia Derbyshire who was responsible for its creation, using a series of tape recorders to laboriously cut and join together the individual sounds she created with both concrete sources and square- and sine-wave oscillators. Grainer was amazed at the results and asked \\"Did I write that?\\" when he heard it. Derbyshire replied that he mostly had. The BBC (who wanted to keep members of the Workshop anonymous) prevented Grainer from getting her a co-composer credit and half the royalties. The title sequence was designed by graphics designer Bernard Lodge and realised by electronic effects specialist Norman Taylor. 1960s =First Doctor= After actors Hugh David (later a director on the series) and Geoffrey Bayldonhttp://wearecult.rocks/the-almost-doctors had both turned down approaches to star in the series, Verity Lambert and the first serial's director Waris Hussein managed to persuade 55-year-old character actor William Hartnell to take the part of the Doctor. Hartnell was known mostly for playing army sergeants and other tough characters in a variety of films, but Lambert had been impressed with his sensitive performance as a rugby league talent scout in the film version of This Sporting Life, which inspired her to offer him the role. Hartnell's Doctor would initially be accompanied by his granddaughter Susan Foreman (played by Carole Ann Ford), originally to have been merely a travelling companion, but with a family tie added by Coburn, who was uncomfortable with the possible undertones the relationship could carry were they to be unrelated. They were joined in the first episode by two of Foreman's schoolteachers, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell), from contemporary 20th-century England. This remained the line-up of the series for the entire first season, but over time the regular line-up would change regularly as the Doctor's various companions left him to return home, having found new causes on worlds they had visited and elected to stay there, or even occasionally being killed off. However, he would always quickly find new travelling companions. Such characters were used by the production team to relate the point of view of the viewers at home, asking questions and furthering the stories by getting into trouble. The first (pilot) episode of the series, \\"An Unearthly Child\\", had to be re-recorded owing to technical problems and errors made during the performance. During the days between the two tapings, changes were made to costuming, effects, performances, and the script (which had originally featured a more callous Doctor, and Susan doing unexplained things such as flicking ink on paper and folding it to produce a symmetrical pattern, and then tracing shapes over the pattern). This second version of \\"An Unearthly Child\\", the first episode of the very first serial, was transmitted at 5.15 pm on 23 November 1963, but due to both a power failure in certain areas of the country and the overshadowing news of US President John F. Kennedy's assassination, it drew minimal comment and was repeated the following week immediately before the second episode. It was not until the second serial, The Daleks, that the programme caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme better than he did. Hartnell's Doctor was not initially paternal or sympathetic; he described himself and Susan simply as \\"wanderers in the 4th dimension\\". He was cantankerous, bossy and occasionally showed a streak of ruthlessness. However, the character mellowed as he grew closer to his companions, and he soon became a popular icon, especially among children who watched the series. This alteration in the portrayal of the Doctor began during the fourth serial, Marco Polo. The Doctor's role was minimal during episode two, \\"The Singing Sands\\", and from the later episodes his portrayal of the character mellowed considerably. The programme became a great success, frequently drawing audiences of 12 million or more, and the Daleks came back for several return appearances. Whitaker left the show early in the second season (though continued writing for it until 1970),https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/ambassadorsofdeath/detail.shtml being briefly replaced by Dennis Spooner, who in turn was replaced by Donald Tosh at the end of the season. Pinfield also left halfway through the season due to poor health, but was not replaced. By the time of the third season in 1965, however, some difficulties were beginning to arise. Lambert had moved on, to be replaced as producer by John Wiles, who did not have a good working relationship with Hartnell. The lead actor himself was finding it increasingly difficult to remember his lines as he was suffering from the early stages of the arteriosclerosis that would later cause his death. Wiles and Tosh came up with a way of writing Hartnell out in the story The Celestial Toymaker, by having the Doctor made invisible for part of the story,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3DHlYgfSdY2RlXkS2KwjtKK/the- fourth-dimension intending that when he re-appeared he would be played by a new actor. However, Wiles was forbidden to replace Hartnell by the new Head of Serials, Gerald Savory. Wiles had also hoped to make other bold changes, such as introducing a companion with a cockney accent (which was vetoed, as he was told all characters must speak \\"BBC English\\"), and resigned shortly afterwards (allegedly after learning that he would be sacked at the end of the season), with Tosh also resigning on principle. By 1966, however, it was clear that Hartnell's health was affecting his performances, and that he would not be able to carry on playing the Doctor for a long period of time. By this point Savory had moved on as Head of Serials and his successor, Shaun Sutton, was more agreeable to change, allowing Wiles' replacement, Innes Lloyd, to make many of the very changes that Wiles had been barred from. Lloyd discussed the situation with Hartnell and the actor agreed that it would be best to leave, although later in life he would claim that he had not wanted to go. =Second Doctor= Lloyd and story editor Gerry Davis came up with an intriguing way of writing the First Doctor out ‚Äì as he was an alien being, they decided that he would have the power to change his body when it became worn out or seriously injured, a process that was called \\"renewal\\" but would later become known within the mythology of the series as \\"regeneration\\". Lloyd and Davis cast actor Patrick Troughton, who first appeared in November 1966 after the changeover from Hartnell had been seen at the end of the story The Tenth Planet. That serial also introduced the popular Cybermen, villains who would return to face the Doctor on several subsequent occasions. Troughton played the role generally in a more lightweight, comical manner, albeit still with much of the original character's passionate hatred of evil and desire to help the oppressed. He also on occasion showed a darker side, manipulating his companions and the people around him for the greater good (examples include The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Evil of the Daleks). Davis left the show at the end of the fourth season, and was replaced by Peter Bryant. A few months later, Lloyd left the show and Bryant was promoted to producer. Bryant's successor as script editor was Derrick Sherwin (though Victor Pemberton had filled the job for Bryant's first serial, The Tomb of the Cybermen). Troughton remained in the part for three seasons until 1969, eventually tiring of the workload of starring in a regular series. By this time, the viewing figures for Doctor Who had fallen considerably, and new script editor Terrance Dicks recalled that there was some talk of ending the series at the conclusion of its sixth season in 1969 (though this has been denied by Bryant, Sherwin and director David Maloney, with paperwork suggesting it was actually in danger at the end of the seventh season in 1970). The series' budget was also increasingly strained by the cost of exotic sets, costumes and props every time the Doctor visited a new setting, and so Bryant and Sherwin (now effectively acting as co-producer, though the BBC refused to credit him as such) came up with the idea of reducing the cost of the series by setting all of the adventures on Earth, with the Doctor to act as the Scientific Advisor to an organisation called UNIT, the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, charged with defending the Earth from alien invasion. This new set-up was tested in the season six-story The Invasion, and at the end of the season was put in place more permanently by having the Second Doctor captured by his own race, the Time Lords, and sentenced to exile on Earth with his appearance being changed again as punishment for his interference in the affairs of other races. Thus Doctor Who ended its sixth production block, and its black and white era. From then on, in common with other British television programmes, it was produced in colour. 1970s =Third Doctor= The Doctor Who \\"diamond\\" logo, used in the show's opening titles from 1973 to 1980 Sherwin's first choice to replace Troughton was actor Ron Moody, star of the musical Oliver!, but when he turned the part down, comic actor Jon Pertwee, another candidate from Sherwin's shortlist, was cast instead. Sherwin had hoped that Pertwee would bring much of his comic acting skill to the part, but he was keen to establish himself as a serious dramatic actor as well as a comedian. Although some lighter touches were visible throughout Pertwee's era, he essentially played it very \\"straight\\" and not at all as Sherwin had envisioned. Pertwee's Doctor was more action-oriented than his predecessors, and the producers allowed Pertwee to indulge his love of riding various vehicles during his tenure, including motorcycles, hovercraft, the so-called \\"Whomobile\\" and the Doctor's vintage roadster, \\"Bessie\\". Sherwin stayed only to oversee the first story of the seventh season. Spearhead from Space was the first Doctor Who story to be made in colour and ‚Äì due to industrial action in the electronic studios ‚Äì the only example of the original series to be made entirely on film. Thereafter, he moved on to work on the series Paul Temple, and was replaced by director Barry Letts after another regular director on the show, Douglas Camfield, had turned down the job. The seventh season, at twenty-five episodes, was shorter than any before, and established a pattern of Doctor Who seasons being between twenty and twenty-eight 25-minute episodes in length, one that would last until the middle of the 1980s. However, although the new format of the Doctor being stuck on Earth had proved popular enough to save the programme from cancellation, neither Letts nor his script editor Terrance Dicks were particularly keen on the idea, and from the eighth season onwards sought reasons for the Doctor to be able to travel in time and space again, eventually having the Time Lords grant him full freedom at the conclusion of the 1973 tenth anniversary story, The Three Doctors, a serial which also featured guest appearances from Troughton and Hartnell, the latter in a restricted role due to his poor health. Another innovation of theirs from the eighth season onwards was the introduction of the character of the Master as a new nemesis for the Doctor, conceived as a Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes. Played by Roger Delgado, he became a highly popular character, although over the following two seasons it was felt, by both the public and the production office, that he became a little overused. Delgado and the production team eventually agreed that he should be written out during the eleventh season by killing the character off, with some ambiguity as to whether or not he had died to save the Doctor. However, before this story could be written, Delgado was killed in a car accident in Turkey. His death had a profound effect on Pertwee. With actress Katy Manning also having departed from her role as companion Jo Grant after three seasons, and Letts and Dicks both planning to move on, Pertwee felt that his \\"family\\" on the show was breaking up, and he decided to leave at the conclusion of the eleventh season in 1974. According to Elisabeth Sladen in an interview on the DVD release of Invasion of the Dinosaurs Pertwee asked for a substantially increased fee for another year on the series, but he was turned down and subsequently resigned from the role. =Fourth Doctor= Although Letts and Dicks were both planning on leaving at the end of the same season, it was they who worked closely on re-casting the role of the Doctor, in preparation to hand over to their successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, who had been a long-time writer for the programme. Letts had intended to cast an older actor as the Fourth Doctor, to hark back to Hartnell's portrayal in the 1960s, but after a long search he eventually selected Tom Baker, who was suggested to him by the incoming Head of Serials, Bill Slater. Baker was only forty years old, almost fifteen years Pertwee's junior, but despite not being the type of actor Letts had originally been looking for, he went on to become arguably the most popular and best- remembered to play the role. He starred in the series for seven years, longer than any of his predecessors or successors, and during his time on the programme Doctor Who enjoyed a consistent run of popular success and high viewing figures. Baker's Doctor was a more eccentric personality, at times passionate and caring, but at other times aloof and alien. This ambivalence was a deliberate choice by Baker, in an attempt to remind the viewers that the Doctor was not human, and therefore had non-human characteristics. Under the control of Hinchcliffe and Holmes, who took over from the beginning of the twelfth season, Doctor Who became a much darker programme, with the pair being heavily influenced by Hammer Films' successful horror film productions and other gothic influences. Their era achieved the highest viewing figures (average ratings for Hinchcliffe's 3 years were over 1 million higher than the average for any other producer) and is frequently praised by fans as a highly successful one, with many serials from that period remaining fan favourites. However, the BBC received complaints from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, that the programme was unfit for children and could traumatise them. While the BBC publicly defended the programme, after three seasons Hinchcliffe was moved on to the adult police thriller series Target in 1977, and his replacement, Graham Williams, was specifically instructed to lighten the tone of the storylines. After staying on during the fifteenth season under Williams for a brief handover period, Holmes also left the programme, and his replacement, Anthony Read, worked with Williams, who was told to create a less violent and more humour-based approach, much to Baker's liking. The actor now felt very possessive of the part and frequently argued with directors over his inclusion of ad-libbed lines, but he was extremely pleased when the levity of the show increased even further after the departure of Read and the hiring of Douglas Adams as script editor for season seventeen in 1979. Some fans have criticised Adams for introducing too much of the sort of humorous content that served him well in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. However, others consider some of Adams' scripts to be among the series' high points, with City of Death (1979) being the primary example. Season 17 saw the show garner its highest-ever viewing figures during the ITV network strike, with estimates of between 16 and 19 million viewers for episodes of the Williams and Adams penned story City of Death. However, there were also problems: director Alan Bromly left the production towards the end of the story Nightmare of Eden due to frustrations at the technicalities of production and arguments with Baker, leaving Williams to oversee completion of the story. Rampant inflation in the television industry was squeezing the series, with the budget much reduced in real terms from where it had been under Hinchcliffe. The scheduled final story of the season, Adams' own Shada, was abandoned midway through recording due to industrial action, and the season finished, after just twenty episodes, in January 1980. Williams and Adams both departed at the end of the season, Williams because he had had enough of the programme after three seasons in charge, and Adams to concentrate on his increasingly successful Hitchhiker's franchise. Williams recommended to the Head of Series & Serials, Graeme MacDonald, that he be replaced by his Production Unit Manager, John Nathan-Turner. Although MacDonald agreed with the principle of appointing someone familiar with the workings of the show, he first offered the job to Nathan-Turner's predecessor George Gallaccio, who after leaving Doctor Who in 1977 had already gained experience as a producer on the BBC Scotland drama The Omega Factor. However, Gallaccio turned the role down, and MacDonald offered it instead to Nathan- Turner, who accepted, and became the new producer. 1980s =John Nathan- Turner era= As Nathan-Turner was a new producer and a restructure of the Drama Department meant that MacDonald would not be able to offer the direct support that had been available to previous producers, the latter appointed Barry Letts to return to the series as Executive Producer and oversee Nathan- Turner's initial season working on the series. Letts had, in fact, been offering unofficial advice and comment to Graham Williams for some time beforehand. Nathan-Turner and the new script editor, Christopher H. Bidmead, sought to return to a more serious tone for the series, reining in much of the humour that had been prevalent during Williams' tenure. The new producer also sought to bring the show \\"into the 1980s\\", commissioning a new title sequence, bringing all the incidental music in-house to be produced electronically by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, and commissioning Peter Howell of the Workshop to come up with a brand-new arrangement of the series' famous theme tune. This displeased both Baker and his co-star Lalla Ward, who did not see eye-to-eye with Nathan-Turner on the new direction. These changes arrived with season eighteen in the autumn of 1980, when the audience for Doctor Who fell dramatically to around five million viewers, due chiefly to competition from the ITV network's American import Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Tom Baker decided that after seven seasons in the part he would leave the role. His departure was heavily publicised in the press, with Baker attracting much comment for his tongue-in-cheek suggestion that his successor could be a woman, which the publicity-aware Nathan-Turner was not quick to deny. =Fifth Doctor= The producer initially sought actor Richard Griffiths to succeed Baker, but when he proved unavailable, cast Peter Davison, with whom he had previously worked on the popular drama series All Creatures Great and Small. Davison was very different from his four predecessors, being much younger, in line with Nathan-Turner's desire for the Fifth Doctor to be completely unlike the popular Fourth, so that the public would not draw unfavourable comparisons between the two. Davison's Doctor was arguably the most human of them all, and the one whose vulnerability was emphasised the most. The Fifth Doctor, more often than not, reacted to circumstances around him rather than being proactive, and had the air of a young aristocrat about him, in contrast to Baker's bohemian personality. Davison made his first appearance at the end of the season eighteen closer, Logopolis, although it was to be several months until his first full season in the part began in 1982. In the meantime Alan Hart, Controller of BBC 1, had decided to move the programme from an autumn to a spring transmission slot. This was partly because, after eighteen years on Saturday evenings, he had also decided to change the transmission date, running the series twice-weekly on weekdays instead of once a week on Saturdays. This had the effect of halving the number of weeks the series was on-air to thirteen instead of twenty-six. Additionally, Davison was also working on the BBC sitcom Sink or Swim and was unavailable to record enough episodes to make an autumn start date viable. This experiment in seeing the viability of running a twice-weekly drama serial would later lead to the launching of the massively popular soap opera EastEnders in a similar slot. It also had the short-term effect of doubling the Doctor Who audience, with the story Black Orchid being the final story of the regular run ‚Äì and the only one of the 1980s ‚Äì to break the double-figure millions barrier for the story overall, with a recorded figure of ten million viewers. The last individual episode with over ten million viewers was the first part of 1982's Time- Flight. During production of the nineteenth season, Bidmead decided to move on and was replaced as script editor, first on a temporary basis by Antony Root and then on a more permanent basis by Eric Saward, who remained in the role for several years. He and Nathan-Turner oversaw an increasing reliance on the show's history in following seasons, with the return of various characters and adversaries from the Doctor's past, culminating in 1983 with the twentieth anniversary special 90-minute episode, The Five Doctors. Davison left the part after three seasons in 1984. He had been advised by Patrick Troughton to stay no longer than three years, and was also disenchanted with the quality of the scripts on the programme during the twentieth season. Although he felt things had improved in the twenty-first, by then his departure had already been announced, and Nathan-Turner had selected Colin Baker ‚Äì who had appeared playing another character in the season twenty story Arc of Infinity ‚Äì to replace him. Colin Baker became the Sixth Doctor on screen in March 1984 at the conclusion of Davison's final story, The Caves of Androzani. =Sixth Doctor= Colin Baker's first full season in 1985 was reasonably successful. Alan Hart had decided to experiment with doubling the length of Doctor Who episodes, with season twenty-two comprising thirteen 45-minute episodes rather than twenty-six 25-minute ones as had previously been the case. The series also returned to Saturday evenings, where it continued to draw reasonably respectable figures of seven to eight million viewers for most episodes even though it faced stiff opposition from another American import on ITV, The A-Team. Baker's portrayal of the Doctor also met with criticism. A more bombastic and overbearing personality than any of the others, the Doctor's use of deadly force against his enemies in a few stories caused controversy. The series once again drew some criticism for the \\"horrific\\" content of some of the episodes. Unlike those misgivings levelled at the earlier reign of producer Philip Hinchcliffe, however, many of these came from within the BBC itself. Michael Grade had taken over as Controller of BBC 1 in 1984, and was not a fan of the series. In fact, he later admitted in interviews that he \\"hated\\" the programme, and he wanted to cancel it outright. There is much debate, however, as to how far his decisions were driven by his personal views. At the time, the BBC was suffering a financial shortfall due to expensive ventures such as the launch of EastEnders, breakfast and daytime television, and savings were needed across the corporation. In any case, when it was announced that Doctor Who's production would be moved back a financial year, the news was interpreted as that the show was under threat of cancellation. The press and public outcry was much larger than Grade or the Board of Governors of the BBC had expected, being given a full-page front cover story in the popular tabloid newspaper The Sun. A charity single, \\"Doctor in Distress\\", was even produced and released in March 1985. It was written by Ian Levine and Fiachra Trench and performed by a group of 30 mid- level celebrities, including Nicola Bryant, Nicholas Courtney and Colin Baker himself, under the banner \\"Who Cares\\". The single was universally panned. Baker's era was interrupted by what would be a long 18-month hiatus between seasons 22 and 23, compared to the then-usual gap of nine months between seasons. Prior to its postponement, plans for season 23 were well advanced, with scripts already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production workers. Season twenty-three eventually aired in the autumn of 1986. Production of the new season was complicated by various factors. Although the episode length had reverted to 25 minutes, the number of episodes was reduced to fourteen, just over half the length of most previous seasons. The series was still up against The A-Team and, having been off the air for eighteen months, found it hard to regain viewers who had turned to ITV. Saward and Nathan-Turner had decided on an overarching storyline for the entire season entitled The Trial of a Time Lord, but its complexities proved confusing to both writers and viewers, with the season drawing viewing figures of only four to five million. Problems existed behind the scenes as well. Robert Holmes, who had returned to writing for the series on a semi-regular basis in 1984, died before he could deliver the final episode. In addition, Saward and Nathan-Turner had a falling out, with Saward resigning from the programme, and Nathan-Turner unofficially taking on the role of script editor after Saward's departure. Despite all of this, Grade consented to allow the series to continue, and moved it away from Saturday nights into a mid-week slot once more, and limited it again to a season of only fourteen 25-minute episodes. He also ordered that a new Doctor be found, as he was not enamoured of Colin Baker's portrayal. Baker was therefore dismissed from the role, despite Nathan-Turner's pleas to the BBC management that Baker did not fulfill his three-year contract, having effectively completed the equivalent of only one-and-a-half seasons. =Seventh Doctor= Nathan-Turner had thought that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other producer available or willing to take on the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he had little choice but to either accept this or resign from the corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he ever let on. The new season was placed by Grade at 7.35 pm on Monday evenings opposite the ITV soap opera, Coronation Street. The latter was the most-watched programme on British television, and the viewing figures for Doctor Who suffered accordingly, though they were frequently the best for any BBC programme broadcast in the slot (viewing figures at the time did not take account of video recordings). The season's quality was also publicly derided by many fans of the programme, although over the following two seasons the criticism was balanced out by some happier viewers, who felt that the young team of writers being assembled by Cartmel was taking the programme in the right direction. Nathan-Turner attempted to leave once more at the end of production on the twenty-fifth season in 1988, but was once again persuaded to stay for a further year after another BBC producer ‚Äì Paul Stone, who had produced The Box of Delights ‚Äì was offered the position but declined. He and Cartmel remained on the production team for the twenty-sixth season in 1989. Although the season once again drew praise, the viewing figures were disastrous, starting at around the 3 million mark and improving to only around 4.5 million by the season's conclusion. At the end of the year, Cartmel was head-hunted to script-edit the BBC's popular medical drama, Casualty, and Nathan-Turner also finally left the show, although no replacements were assigned for either position as in-house production was being shut down. Although Michael Grade had left the BBC in 1987 to take up a new position as Chief Executive of Channel 4, Doctor Who remained in its poor slot opposite Coronation Street in seasons of only fourteen 25-minute episodes, and continued to suffer in the ratings. Jonathan Powell, the new Controller of BBC 1, regarded Nathan-Turner with contempt,Matthew Sweet \\"JN-T: The Life and Scandalous Times of John Nathan-Turner by Richard Marson ‚Äì review\\", The Guardian (website), 22 March 2013 and the BBC's new Head of Series, Peter Cregeen, decided to cancel the series, a decision which was clear to the production team by the end of production on the twenty-sixth season in August 1989. The final story to be produced as part of the original run was Ghost Light, although it was not the last to be broadcast. That was Survival, the last episode of which was transmitted on 6 December 1989, and brought the series' twenty-six-year run to a close. John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode as it was possibly going to be the last ever. Accordingly, Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989 ‚Äì by coincidence, the show's twenty- sixth anniversary. This was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and his companion Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures. 1990s =Planned Season 27= At the time production of the original series was cancelled, work had already begun on Season 27. Both McCoy and incumbent companion Sophie Aldred (Ace) have stated that they would have left during this season. Storylines would have seen Ace joining the Time Lord academy on Gallifrey, and the introduction of a cat burglar as the new companion. Script editor Andrew Cartmel had already begun work on four loosely connected stories which would have comprised the season: Earth Aid by Ben Aaronovitch (a space opera featuring insect-like aliens), Ice Time by Marc Platt (set in 1960s London, featuring the return of the Ice Warriors and Ace's departure), Crime of the Century by Cartmel (a contemporary story featuring animal testing), and Alixion by Robin Mukherjee (in which the Doctor is lured to an isolated asteroid to play a series of life-or-death games). Ahead of the new companion's introduction, Ice Time would have featured her father, a criminal named Sam Tollinger, who was intended to be a recurring character. Alixion would have seen the Doctor going insane after facing a psychic enemy, with mental rather than physical strain being the cause of his regeneration at the end of the season. However, since the programme was placed on indefinite hiatus, none of these stories were fully developed. Actors Richard Griffiths and Ian Richardson were two names mentioned by the production team as replacements for McCoy. (The above details appear based primarily on a theoretical article written by Dave Owen for Doctor Who Magazine in issue 205, August 1997. In particular, the concept of regeneration through insanity was of Owen's own invention and was never part of the plans of Andrew Cartmel or his team of writers, although Cartmel has since become aware of the idea and given it his approval as a potentially fitting end to the Seventh Doctor. None of the stories above were commissioned at the time of cancellation, even to the point of rough outlines, and were put together by Dave Owen from interviews with the most likely authors to have been commissioned had the series gone ahead.) On 12 November 2009 Big Finish Productions announced they were doing an audio version of Season 27 with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred and Beth Chalmers as new companion named Raine Creevey (not Kate Tollinger as previously suggested). Marc Platt contributed Thin Ice, while script editor Andrew Cartmel has written Crime of the Century, Animal and co- written Earth Aid with Ben Aaronovitch. =Beyond television= After the series was taken off the air in 1989, various Doctor Who projects were produced under license from the BBC. Doctor Who Magazine continued its long- running comic strip and published original fiction, initially continuing the run of stories with the seventh Doctor and Ace and featuring other companions and Doctors. Virgin Publishing published a series of original books, The New Adventures of Doctor Who (NAs), from 1991 to 1997. This series continued the stories of the seventh Doctor, further exploring and developing the themes and ideas introduced in the later years of the television series. Several writers who had worked on that era wrote NAs, as well as writers of earlier eras and some writers who would work on the new series, including Russell T Davies, Paul Cornell, Mark Gatiss and Gareth Roberts. The NAs introduced original companions, including Bernice Summerfield, and at one point the series editors considered regenerating the Doctor; they did however regenerate The Master. The success of the NAs led Virgin to publish The Missing Adventures, featuring earlier Doctors and companions, and several short story anthologies. Following the television movie (see below), the eighth Doctor replaced the seventh in both the comic strip and original books. BBC Books took back the rights to publish original fiction in 1997 and published two series, the Eighth Doctor Adventures and the Past Doctor Adventures as well as some anthologies of short stories, until 2005. Big Finish Productions adapted several NAs, minus the Doctor, into audio plays; on the back of these, they won a license from the BBC to produce original audio plays featuring the Doctors and their companions, and eventually also produced plays featuring other characters and monsters from the TV series and spin-offs; Big Finish has also published short story anthologies. Big Finish attracted a number of writers from the books series as well as new writers, including Rob Shearman; it also gave future Doctor David Tennant his first acting role in a Doctor Who story. For more information, see the Doctor Who spin-offs article. Although it was for all intents and purposes cancelled (series co-star Sophie Aldred said in the documentary More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS that she was told it was cancelled), the BBC maintained the series was merely \\"on hiatus\\" and insisted the show would return. Nathan-Turner would produce just one more Doctor Who project, the 30th anniversary special Dimensions in Time, in 1993, a replacement for an aborted 30th anniversary project called The Dark Dimension. =Eighth Doctor= Although in-house production had ceased, the BBC were hopeful of finding an independent production company to re-launch the show and had been approached for such a venture as early as July 1989 (while the 26th series was still in production)Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Paninni Comics 2003 by Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States. Segal's negotiations dragged on for several years, and followed him from Columbia to Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment company and finally to Universal Studios' television arm. At Amblin, Segal had come close to interesting the CBS network in commissioning the series as a mid-season replacement show in 1994, but this eventually came to nothing. Finally, at Universal, Segal managed to interest the Fox Network in the programme, in the form of their vice-president in charge of Television Movie production, Trevor Walton, an Englishman who was already familiar with the series. Although Walton had no power to commission a series, he was able to commission a one-time television movie that served as a backdoor pilot for a possible series revival. The movie that was eventually made was simply titled Doctor Who. To distinguish it from the television series, Segal later suggested the alternate title Enemy Within. Opinions on how to refer to the television movie differ among fans, but the most common usage is to just call it the \\"television movie\\" or abbreviate it as \\"the TVM\\". The original plan was for a completely new American version of Doctor Who, in the same way that Sanford and Son was an unrelated re-make of Steptoe and Son and All in the Family had re-made Till Death Us Do Part. However, when new scriptwriter Matthew Jacobs came on board in 1995 ‚Äì at Walton's persuasion, feeling that a simpler story was needed than the intricate back-stories Segal had created with writer John Leekley ‚Äì he persuaded Segal that the movie should instead be a direct continuation of the BBC series, something no American production had ever attempted before when buying the rights to a British programme. Segal agreed, and Sylvester McCoy appeared briefly at the beginning of the film, before \\"regenerating\\" into the Eighth Doctor as played by Paul McGann. McGann had been Segal's first choice for the part, although both the actor himself and the Fox Network had not initially been keen. Segal later claimed that the BBC's Executive Producer on the project, Jo Wright, had wanted the role of the \\"previous Doctor\\" to be played by Tom Baker, as it was felt he was regarded as the definitive Doctor by the British public and McCoy's tenure had not been as popular, but she backed down when Segal explained how this went against the continuity of the programme. Segal also had to fight to retain the familiar Doctor Who theme: composer John Debney wanted to write a new piece, but was convinced to create a rearrangement of Ron Grainer's composition, although Grainer did not receive screen credit for his work. A further tie to the BBC series was the use of the logo used from 1970 to 1973 during the Jon Pertwee era. This logo subsequently became the official franchise logo until it was replaced in 2004, although it still appears on all merchandise featuring any of the original series Doctors. Transmitted on the Fox Network on 14 May 1996 and on BBC One thirteen days later ‚Äì although actually having debuted on CityTV in Toronto, Canada, the film having been shot in Vancouver, on 12 May ‚Äì the production drew only 5.5 million viewers in the United States, although it was far more successful in the UK with 9 million viewers, one of the top-ten programmes of the week. McGann's Doctor was a combination of boyish glee and wonder at the universe with occasional flashes of an old soul in a young body, and was well received by fans, even if the reactions to the television movie were mixed. However, in spite of the success and popularity of the film in the UK, the disappointing US viewing figures led Fox to decline to commission a series. With no broadcast network attached in the United States, Universal could not produce a series for the BBC alone. Indeed, it would have been cheaper for the BBC to make a new series themselves rather than pay for a series with no production partner. Thus plans for a new series were scrapped, with no new production looking likely as the decade came to an end. =Back to the BBC= Following the 1996 television movie, Universal retained some rights to produce new Doctor Who stories, but without a broadcaster attached, they allowed those rights to expire. Full production rights therefore reverted to the BBC in 1997. Little happened at the BBC regarding new Doctor Who production until the following year, when producer Mal Young arrived at the corporation's in-house production arm as Head of Continuing Drama Series. Young was keen on reviving the programme, and this interest was shared by the then controller of BBC One, Peter Salmon. Tony Wood, a producer in Young's department, who previously worked at Granada Television, recalled his former colleague Russell T Davies' enthusiasm for the programme and recommended him to Young as someone who might make a good writer of a new version. Davies had recently written for the Granada dramas The Grand and Touching Evil for the ITV network, and earlier in the decade had worked for the BBC, writing the well-received children's science fiction serials Century Falls and Dark Season, which itself contained many Doctor Who-influenced themes. A meeting was arranged between Davies and Mal Young's development producer, Patrick Spence. In 1999 the media took hold of the story following the success and critical acclaim surrounding Davies' Channel 4 drama, Queer as Folk. Although various sources claimed that a provisional title of Doctor Who 2000 had been given to the proposed new series, in reality very little work had been done, as Peter Salmon had been informed by BBC Worldwide that a new series would upset the tentative plans they were making for a new film version of the series. Thus, plans for the television revival were shelved for the time, and seemed to become even less likely in 2000 when Salmon was replaced as controller of BBC One. 2000s =40th Anniversary Doctor= However, Salmon's successor, Lorraine Heggessey, proved to be equally enthusiastic about the idea of new Doctor Who, often commenting to the press that she would like to pursue the idea but that \\"rights difficulties\\" prevented it. Similarly positive comments were made by the corporation's overall Head of Drama, Jane Tranter. Heggessey had received several new series proposals since she had taken over control of BBC One, the highest-profile being from producer Dan Freedman ‚Äì who had produced a full- cast, official, audio Doctor Who story, entitled Death Comes to Time, for the BBCi website in 2001. Another came from actor and writer Mark Gatiss, who in 2002 drew up and submitted a proposal in collaboration with writer Gareth Roberts and then Doctor Who Magazine editor Clayton Hickman. In the meantime, BBCi, the interactive media arm of the corporation, who had scored successes with their Doctor Who webcasts (beginning with the aforementioned Death Comes to Time, which was followed by Real Time in 2002 and a re-make of the uncompleted Shada in 2003), decided on a more ambitious project to celebrate the programme's upcoming 40th anniversary. In July 2003, BBCi announced the production of Scream of the Shalka, a fully animated adventure adapted for webcasting with Richard E. Grant as the Doctor and Sir Derek Jacobi as the Master. As there were no concrete plans for producing a new series, BBCi announced Shalka as the official continuation of the programme, and that Grant was the official Ninth Doctor. However, events were soon to overtake that. =Ninth Doctor= In September 2003, Heggessey managed to persuade Worldwide that as several years had now passed and they were no nearer to producing a film, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. The other proposals notwithstanding, Tranter and Heggessey elected to approach Davies once again, who had often told the BBC when approached for other projects that he would only return to them to take charge of a new series of Doctor Who. He quickly accepted, and on 26 September 2003 it was officially announced that Doctor Who would be returning to BBC One, produced in-house at BBC Wales in 2004 for transmission in 2005. Davies was made the chief writer and Executive Producer of the new series (called Series One instead of continuing the numbering with Season 27, although the narrative thread continued from the old series rather than starting afresh), and other writers included Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat, Paul Cornell and Rob Shearman. The Producer was Phil Collinson and the other Executive Producers were Mal Young (although he subsequently left the BBC midway through production at the end of 2004), and BBC Wales Head of Drama, Julie Gardner. A new arrangement of the theme tune was composed by Murray Gold. Gardner later commented that the choice of Cardiff as the base for filming the series was the result of a combination of factors. She and Davies, who had worked together on the BBC drama series Casanova starring David Tennant, were both from Wales; the BBC was looking to move more of its productions away from London; and there was a good variety of filming locations in the area. The new series would comprise thirteen 45-minute-long episodes, with the first story titled \\"Rose\\" after the Doctor's new companion Rose Tyler. Unlike past seasons which used serial-style storytelling, the new series would have mainly standalone or two-part episodes. Filming of the first season began in Cardiff on 18 July 2004. With the new series confirmed, when Shalka was webcast in November 2003, the further adventures of Grant's Ninth Doctor were in doubt. In February 2004, plans for sequels to Shalka were indefinitely shelved, although Grant's version of the character, now dubbed the \\"Shalka Doctor\\", would return in a short story entitled \\"The Feast of the Stone\\" published on the BBC website. After much speculation in the press about possible candidates, BBC announced that Christopher Eccleston would be the Ninth Doctor, accompanied by former pop singer Billie Piper as Rose. In the April 2004 issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies announced that Eccleston's Doctor would indeed be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Grant's Ninth Doctor to non-official status. In April 2004, Michael Grade returned to the BBC, this time as the Chairman of the Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he was quoted as being generally indifferent to the new series, he eventually wrote an e-mail to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity. He also declared, \\"I never dreamed I would ever write this. I must be going soft!\\" However, not everyone was pleased with the new production. Some fans criticised the new logo and perceived changes to the TARDIS model. According to various news sources, members of the production team even received hate mail and death threats. The new logo and trailers were posted on the BBC website and were followed up by television spots in March 2005 with a media blitz in the run up to the transmission of \\"Rose\\" on 26 March. An employee of a third party company associated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation leaked a rough cut of the premiere on the internet; the leak attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans. Advance reviews in the British media were generally positive. \\"Rose\\" finally saw transmission on 26 March at 7 pm on BBC One, the first regular episode of Doctor Who for over 15 years. To complement the series, BBC Wales also produced Doctor Who Confidential, a 13-part documentary series with each episode broadcast on BBC Three immediately after the end of the weekly instalment on BBC One. \\"Rose\\" received average overnight ratings of 9.9 million viewers, peaking at 10.5 million. The final figure for the episode, including video recordings watched within a week of transmission, was 10.81 million, No. 3 for BBC One that week and No. 7 across all channels. The success of the launch saw the BBC's Head of Drama Jane Tranter confirming on 30 March that the series would return both for a Christmas Special in December 2005 and a full second series in 2006. The series was well received by both critics and the public. The 2005 TV Choice/TV Quick Award went to Eccleston for Best Actor, and Doctor Who was nominated for Best Series. Eccleston, Piper, and Doctor Who were all winners in their categories at the UK's National Television Awards, announced on 25 October 2005. Although not as prestigious as the British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), they are the highest-profile UK television awards voted on by members of the public. The series did go on to win two BAFTA awards in May, including the Best Drama Series category. Due to an initial lack of interest by networks in the United States, Doctor Who debuted on the Sci Fi Channel on 17 March 2006, one year after the Canadian and UK showings. Although the new series clearly continues the storyline of the original ‚Äì with Eccleston identified in publicity materials as the Ninth Doctor, and the appearance of original series elements such as UNIT and Sarah-Jane Smith‚Äîthe BBC is officially treating the series as a new programme, calling the 2005 season \\"Series 1\\". This has led to controversy between fans who wish to follow the BBC's numbering and those who consider the 2005 series to be Season 27 (and so on). Concurrent with the new series, BBC Books revamped its line of Doctor Who original fiction, retiring for now its Eighth Doctor and Past Doctor paperback line (the last such volume appearing in late 2005) and launching a new series of hardback novels featuring the Ninth and, later, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors (see New Series Adventures). =Tenth Doctor= Hours after the announcement of a second series, tabloid newspapers The Sun and the Daily Express reported that Eccleston had quit the series. Eccleston then apparently released a statement through the BBC, saying that he would be leaving the role at Christmas for fear of being typecast. Fan reaction to the news ranged from disappointment to sadness to irritation to outright anger. Some did point out, however, that the series is uniquely suited to deal with cast changes. The number of angry postings on the popular Outpost Gallifrey fan forum was enough for Shaun Lyon, the owner of the website, to close down the forum for two days to allow tempers to cool. Speculation arose as to how long the production team had been aware of Eccleston's decision. Eventually, it transpired that the departure had been planned and the scripts written to accommodate Eccleston's departure, but it was not meant to have been announced until after the first series had concluded. The BBC said that they had falsely attributed the statement to Eccleston, and released it in violation of an earlier agreement not to reveal his departure publicly. The statement had been made after journalists made queries to the press office. On 16 April 2005, the BBC confirmed that David Tennant would be the Tenth Doctor. The regeneration from Eccleston to Tennant took place in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", the season finale. Tennant and Piper next starred in a 7-minute mini-episode for Children in Need. Tennant's first full story as the Doctor was the 2005 Christmas special, \\"The Christmas Invasion\\", and Piper joined him for the whole of Series 2. At a BAFTA screening of \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", the finale of the 2005 series, on 15 June 2005, Jane Tranter announced that both a second seasonal episode (later titled \\"The Runaway Bride\\") and third series of Doctor Who had been commissioned. Piper left the programme at the end of Series 2, and a new companion, Martha Jones (played by Freema Agyeman), joined Tennant at the start of Series 3 on 31 March 2007. Series 2 aired in the UK and US in 2006, and finished airing in Canada on 12 February 2007. The third series aired in the UK in the spring of 2007 and began airing in Canada and the US during the summer of that year. A 2007 Christmas Special \\"Voyage of the Damned\\" was broadcast on 25 December 2007 in the UK, featuring Kylie Minogue as a waitress named Astrid. The fourth series aired in the UK in 2008 featuring two companions; Donna Noble, who first appeared in \\"The Runaway Bride\\" and Martha Jones, who returned to the series for five episodes of series four. Billie Piper also returned to the show to reprise her original role as Rose Tyler. Following broadcast of the fourth series, the BBC announced that the show would not return as a weekly series in 2009, due to a number of factors. Instead, four specials would be broadcast in 2009, with a full series returning in 2010. It was later announced that when the full series returned in 2010, Tennant would no longer be the Doctor. Playing the role would be the 26-year-old actor Matt Smith. The return of Doctor Who has led to the BBC launching a number of spin-offs and related programmes. The first of these was the behind-the-scenes series Doctor Who Confidential which began airing on BBC Three in conjunction with the 2005 series and returned for a new set of episodes in 2006; each episode focuses on elements of that week's Doctor Who episode, and the series has continued alongside all stories since 2005. In 2006, the first full Doctor Who spin-off series, Torchwood, debuted on BBC Three; it did not air in the United States until BBC America debuted it in September 2007, while the Canadian CBC aired it in October 2007. A second behind-the-scenes series, Totally Doctor Who, which aired on BBC One, also debuted in 2006. After the appearance of Sarah Jane Smith in the 2006 episode \\"School Reunion\\", it was announced that Elisabeth Sladen would reprise the role in a new series entitled The Sarah Jane Adventures, the first episode of which aired on BBC One on 1 January 2007, followed by its debut as a weekly series in September 2007. Following Sladen's death, the programme came to an end after its fifth series in autumn 2011. Yet another spin-off series, K-9, was announced for 2007, but this series was not being produced by the BBC. In addition, Tennant and Agyeman provided voice acting work for The Infinite Quest, an animated serial that aired as part of the 2007 series of Totally Doctor Who. 2010s =Eleventh Doctor= The TARDIS prop used from 2010‚Äì2017. On 20 May 2008 it was announced that Russell T Davies would step down as executive producer and head writer of Doctor Who in 2009; Steven Moffat was confirmed as his replacement. On 29 October 2008, during his acceptance speech via live feed at the National Television Awards, David Tennant publicly announced his intention to exit the series at the end of the 2009 specials, making way for a new actor to portray the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in the 2010 series. 26-year-old actor Matt Smith was announced as his successor in a special edition of Doctor Who Confidential, broadcast on BBC One on 3 January 2009. Production on Moffat and Smith's first series began in July 2009, and the first episode was broadcast on 3 April 2010. The new series was accompanied by a new logo, unveiled on 6 October 2009, and a new title sequence. The series featured a completely redesigned TARDIS interior, a slightly altered TARDIS exterior, and a new companion ‚Äì Amy Pond ‚Äì portrayed by Karen Gillan. Gillan was joined on a recurring basis by Arthur Darvill, playing Amy's boyfriend (later husband) Rory Williams, and Alex Kingston as the mysterious River Song. The Eleventh Doctor's first series concluded on 26 June 2010 with transmission of the series finale \\"The Big Bang\\", followed by another Christmas Special, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and a pair of Comic Relief mini-episodes, \\"Space\\" and \\"Time,\\" broadcast on 18 March 2011. A second full series of 13 episodes was commissioned for 2011, with Smith and Gillan both returning as the Doctor and Amy respectively (making it the first time since the show's relaunch in 2005 that both the Doctor and main companion had remained the same from one series to the next). The series was broadcast in two-halves, with the first seven episodes broadcast between April and June 2011, and the final six beginning on 27 August 2011. With the new series, Darvill was upgraded to series regular and full-time companion as Rory, and Kingston continued to appear on a recurring basis as River Song. Due partly to budget restrictions at the BBC, the expected 2012 series, Smith's third, was split into 5 episodes transmitted from September 2012 and a further 8 transmitted from April 2013, with the now traditional Christmas special between these 2 groups of episodes. Gillan and Darvill departed from the show at the end of the first group of episodes; new companion Clara Oswald debuted in the 2012 Christmas special, played by Jenna Coleman. The advent of the show's 50th anniversary in November 2013 meant that instead of starting to film an 8th series, the BBC started work on a feature-length special, to be transmitted on 23 November 2013, the precise date of the show's 50th anniversary. As well as being made in 3D for presentation at selected cinemas, the episode was also announced to be co-starring David Tennant and Billie Piper, reprising their roles of the Tenth Doctor and Rose, though ultimately Billie Piper played The Moment, a Gallifreyan Weapon that took the form of Rose. Smith stepped down as the Eleventh Doctor with his last episode being the 2013 Christmas special. On 4 August 2013 in a live TV special, Peter Capaldi was revealed as the Twelfth Doctor. =Twelfth Doctor= It was announced on 4 August 2013 on a live BBC special entitled Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor that Peter Capaldi would portray the twelfth incarnation of the Doctor in 'Doctor Who'. During his appearance in the special, he said that he had been a fan of the series; a letter that he had written to the Radio Times at the age of 15 about the show was read aloud. Capaldi had already appeared in the series 4 episode \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\" as Caecilius, the father of the family that the Doctor saves from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. He had also appeared in Torchwood: Children of Earth as the civil servant John Frobisher. Series 8 was once again broadcast weekly in one continuous block, albeit with a reduced length of 12 episodes in total. Jenna Coleman remained as a main cast member in the role of Clara. The series premiere \\"Deep Breath\\" was first broadcast on 23 August 2014. The 2014 Christmas special \\"Last Christmas\\" was originally intended to be Clara's exit from the show, but was rewritten following Coleman's decision to stay for an additional series. Series 9 was again commissioned for 12 regular episodes, starring Capaldi as the Doctor and Coleman as Clara. The series premiered on 19 September 2015 with the episode \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\". Most of the series consisted of two-part stories, with the exception of the ninth episode \\"Sleep No More\\" acting as a standalone story and the final three episodes forming a loose three-parter. Coleman departed from the show in the series finale \\"Hell Bent\\", broadcast 5 December 2015. The 2015 Christmas special, \\"The Husbands of River Song\\", saw Alex Kingston return for the character River Song's final appearance. On 22 January 2016, the BBC announced that Moffat would be stepping down as show runner after series 10 of Doctor Who and would be replaced by Chris Chibnall as lead writer and executive producer. In addition, series 10 would debut in Spring 2017, with a Christmas special airing in 2016. On 30 January 2017, Peter Capaldi announced he would be stepping down as the Twelfth Doctor in the 2017 Christmas special. Series 10 once again starred Peter Capaldi as the Doctor and introduced Pearl Mackie as new companion Bill Potts. Matt Lucas as the recurring guest character Nardole was also promoted to series regular. The twelve-episode series premiered on 15 April 2017 with \\"The Pilot\\". Cast members Capaldi, Mackie and Lucas as well as show runner Moffat all departed from Doctor Who in the 2017 Christmas special \\"Twice Upon a Time\\", which also guest-starred David Bradley as the First Doctor. =Thirteenth Doctor= It was announced on 16 July 2017 that Jodie Whittaker would portray the Thirteenth Doctor in the eleventh series. She is the first woman to be cast in the role. The series introduced a new set of companions, including Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole, and Mandip Gill as Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan, respectively. A new logo was unveiled at the BBC Worldwide showcase on 20 February 2018. This logo was designed by the creative agency Little Hawk, who also created a stylised insignia of the word \\"who\\" enclosed in a circle with an intersecting line. A new opening title sequence was also introduced; however, it did not debut until the second episode of the series. Series 11 premiered on 7 October 2018 with \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\". The episode count was again reduced to ten regular episodes. In place of the traditional Christmas special that had aired annually over 2005‚Äì2017, a New Years special, \\"Resolution\\", was broadcast on 1 January 2019. No regular episodes were broadcast throughout 2019. Series 12 was commissioned for another ten-episode run in 2020, with all the main cast from the previous series returning. Rather than having a dedicated Christmas or New Years special, 1 January 2020 instead saw the broadcast of the series premiere \\"Spyfall, Part 1\\"; the series then took up its regular timeslot on 5 January with \\"Spyfall, Part 2\\". A special, \\"Revolution of the Daleks\\", is intended for broadcast on either Christmas 2020 or New Years Day 2021.

The word akemantak is an Algonquian name for the species and means \\"wood used for snowshoes\\".  Description  Larix laricina is a small to medium-size boreal coniferous and deciduous tree reaching tall, with a trunk up to diameter. Tamaracks and larches (Larix species) are deciduous conifers. The bark is tight and flaky, pink, but under flaking bark it can appear reddish. The leaves are needle-like, short, light blue-green, turning bright yellow before they fall in the autumn, leaving the pale pinkish-brown shoots bare until the next spring. The needles are produced spirally on long shoots and in dense clusters on long woody spur shoots. The cones are the smallest of any larch, only long, with 12-25 seed scales; they are bright red, turning brown and opening to release the seeds when mature, 4 to 6 months after pollination. Key characteristics: * The needles are normally borne on a short shoot in groups of 10‚Äì20 needles. * The larch is deciduous and the needles turn yellow in autumn. * The seed cones are small, less than long, with lustrous brown scales. * Larch are commonly found in swamps, fens, bogs, and other low-land areas.  Distribution and ecology  Tamarack larch foliage and cones in August. The lighter brown cones are from the current season; the darker brown cones are mature cones from previous seasons. Tamaracks are very cold tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to at least , and commonly occurs at the Arctic tree line at the edge of the tundra. Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in swamps, bogs, or muskegs, in wet to moist organic soils such as sphagnum, peat, and woody peat. They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on calcareous soils, it is not abundant on the limestone areas of eastern Ontario. Tamarack sapling in a sphagnum bog Tamarack is generally the first forest tree to grow filled-lake bogs. In the lake states, tamarack may appear first in the sedge mat, sphagnum moss, or not until the bog shrub stage. Farther north, it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage. Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns, so it is one of the common pioneers on sites in the boreal forest immediately after a fire. The central Alaskan population, separated from the eastern Yukon populations by a gap of about , is treated as a distinct variety Larix laricina var. alaskensis by some botanists, though others argue that it is not sufficiently distinct to be distinguished.  Associated forest cover  Young tree with fall colors Tamarack forms extensive pure stands in the boreal region of Canada and in northern Minnesota. In the rest of its United States range and in the Maritime Provinces, tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands. It is a major component in the Society of American Foresters (SAF) forest cover types Tamarack and black spruce‚Äìtamarack. Black spruce (Picea mariana) is usually tamarack's main associate in mixed stands on all sites. The other most common associates include balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the boreal region. In the better organic soil sites in the northern forest region, the most common associates are the northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), balsam fir, black ash (Fraxinus nigra), and red maple (Acer rubrum). In Alaska, quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together. Additional common associates are American elm (Ulmus americana), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), Kenai birch (B. papyrifera var. kenaica), and yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis). Tamarack stands cast light shade and so usually have a dense undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, a great variety of shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include dwarf and swamp birch (Betula glandulosa and Betula pumila), willows (Salix spp.), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), and red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera). Low shrubs include bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bog-rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), leather leaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), and small cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes sedges (Carex spp.), cottongrass (Eriophorum spp.), three-leaved false Solomonseal (Maianthemum trifolium), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh- marigold (Caltha palustris), and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). Ground cover is usually composed of sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) and other mosses.  Seed cones and pollen cones  Tamarack is monoecious. Male and female cones are small, either solitary or in groups of 2 or 3, and appear with the needles. Male cones are yellow and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old branchlets. Female cones resemble tiny roses. They are reddish or maroon, have needles at their base which are shorter and bluer than the other needles on the tree. They are borne most commonly on 2 to 4-year-old branchlets, but may also appear on branchlets 5 or more years old. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On open-grown trees, cones are borne on all parts of the crown. Mature seed cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and long.  Uses  Larix laricina bonsai The wood is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and was used by the Algonquian people for making snowshoes and other products where toughness was required. The natural crooks located in the stumps and roots are also preferred for creating knees in wooden boats. Currently, the wood is used principally for pulpwood, but also for posts, poles, rough lumber, and fuelwood; it is not a major commercial timber species. Tamarack wood is also used in horse stables to resist abrasion and kicking damage. It is also grown as an ornamental tree in gardens in cold regions. Several dwarf cultivars have been created that are available commercially. Tamarack is commonly used for bonsai. Tamarack poles were used in corduroy roads because of their resistance to rot. Tamarack trees were used before 1917 in Alberta to mark the northeast corner of sections surveyed within townships. They were used by the surveyors because at that time the very rot-resistant wood was readily available in the bush and was light to carry. Their rot resistance was also why they were often used in early water distribution systems. The aboriginal peoples of Canada's northwest regions used the inner bark as a poultice to treat cuts, infected wounds, frostbite, boils and hemorrhoids. The outer bark and roots are also said to have been used with another plant as a treatment for arthritis, cold and general aches and pains. Wildlife use the tree for food and nesting. Porcupines eat the inner bark, snowshoe hares feeds on tamarack seedlings, and red squirrels eat the seeds. Birds that frequent tamaracks during the summer include the white- throated sparrow, song sparrow, veery, common yellow throat, and Nashville warbler.Dawson, Deanna K. 1979. Bird communities associated with succession and management of lowland conifer forests. In Management of north central and northeastern forests for nongame birds: workshop proceedings, 1979. p. 120-131. USDA Forest Service, General Technical Report NC-51. North Central Forest Experiment Station, St. Paul, MN.  Reaction to competition  Tamarack is very intolerant of shade. Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years, it must become dominant to survive. When mixed with other species, it must be in the over story. The tree is a good self- pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length. Because tamarack is very shade-intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor bog sites, whereas northern white- cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good swamp sites. Recurring sawfly outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably speeded the usual succession to black spruce or other associates. Various tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment. The shade-intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management. Some adaptation of clear cutting or seed-tree cutting is generally considered the best silvicultural system because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open, and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually wind-firm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and herbicide spraying.  Damaging agents  The tamarack has thin bark and is therefore highly susceptible to fire damage, except perhaps in older, upland stands. However, the habitat of tamarack, especially south of the boreal forest, is normally wet enough to protect the tree from fire. The tamarack is also susceptible to high winds. Strong winds can uproot large tamarack trees growing in swamps or other wet- land sites where rooting is shallow. It has also been discovered that abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands. Those that survive under such conditions usually grow very slowly. Other effects of high water include dieback and the development of adventitious roots and shoots. Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding. Many insect species are known to be destructive to tamaracks. The non-indigenous larch sawfly is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across Canada and the northern United States and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern Manitoba and northern Minnesota, however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the larch casebearer Coleophora laricella. The larch casebearer attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established. Only a few other insects and related organisms (such as mites) that feed on tamarack are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) can severely damage tamarack. The larch-bud moth (Zeiraphera improbana) has had occasional short epidemics, and the spruce spider mite (Oligonychus ununguis) is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The larch-shoot moth (Argyresthia laricella) is widely distributed, but serious injury is unusual. One of the most common bark beetles attacking tamarack is the eastern larch beetle (Dendroctonus simplex), but it feeds mainly on weakened, dying, or dead trees. Tamarack is a host to many pathogens, but only one cause diseases serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture, the Lachnellula willkommii fungus. It is a relatively new pathogen in Canada, first recorded in 1980 and originating in Europe. The fungus cause large cankers to form and a disease known as larch canker which is particularly harmful to the tamarack larch, killing both young and mature trees.European larch canker Natural Resources Canada Apart from this, the only common foliage diseases are rusts, such as the leaf rust in eastern and central North America. However, this rust, caused by the fungus Melampsora medusae, and other rusts do little damage to tamarack. The needle-cast fungus Hypodermella laricis has attacked tamarack in Ontario and has the potential for local damage.

Although Fido's parent company, Rogers Communications, also operates another cellular service Rogers Wireless, Fido remains a separate entity and retains its own retail chain, customer service call centres, network servers and CEO. Fido pioneered the concept of providing unlimited service in select Canadian cities. Fido was the first carrier in Canada to launch a GSM-based network and the first wireless service provider in North America to offer General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) on its network. Fido's logo is a yellow doghouse. The name, \\"Fido,\\" was suggested to Microcell Solutions, the first importer of GSM technology from Europe to Canada, on the recommendation of its marketing-communications agency at the time, BOS (Beauchesne, Ostiguy, Simard) of Montreal (now DentsuBos). The agency had been searching for a name that would appeal to both French- and English-speaking consumers. The brand name \\"Fido\\" inevitably led to the use of dogs in its commercials, which became the brand's informal trademark in TV advertising, starting in 1995. During the 2000s it ran ads where the narrator finished by catching a jumping dog and saying \\"regrettably, only from Fido\\". As of 2017, the tagline is \\"Go get it.\\" History The original development of Fido was funded in part by Voicestream, now T-Mobile US. Fido was the first provider in Canada to offer a network with the GSM standard. =Acquisition by Rogers= In November 2004, Microcell was acquired by the other competing GSM carrier, Rogers Communications, for an estimated $1.4 billion. At the time of acquisition, Fido had 1,275,094 customers. The company's name was changed to Fido Solutions shortly thereafter. Fido has retained its data roaming service with T-Mobile. Shortly thereafter, Rogers Communications also bought Sprint Canada, a telecom services reseller that was an MVNO partner with Microcell. As of May 2013, Fido had a customer base of 3,372,763 customers,Fido subs vs Rogers sub etc. Howardforums.com. Retrieved on December 29, 2016. making it Canada's fourth-largest wireless carrier. Within Rogers Communications, Fido has been re-positioned as a mid-range brand, with Rogers Wireless as the full- service brand having the widest coverage and longest service hours, and Chatr as the entry-level offering that offers mostly prepaid plans and has the smallest coverage. Although there is some overlap between Fido and Rogers Wireless, Fido tends to offer a greater selection of Bring your own device plans, while offering less subsidies for devices on contracts, and having a delayed launch of the latest phones. Fido's subscriber base appeals largely to millennials, whereas Rogers Wireless caters to traditional clients including corporate customers. Fido's direct competitors are the flanker brands Virgin Mobile Canada and Koodo Mobile, which complement full-service providers Bell Mobility, Telus Mobility and Vid√©otron. Network Since its inception, the Fido network runs on GSM 1900 and offers coverage in major urban areas in Canada. This network continues to exist today. The end result is that both Fido and Rogers customers can now access and use all the towers of either network or both with a single account, device and SIM card. Regardless of which network is accessed, Fido customers will see \\"Fido\\" as the network name, and Rogers customers will see \\"ROGERS\\" as the network name. Similarly, HSPA+ service is available in 850 MHz and 1900 MHz frequencies. The maximum theoretical download speed is of 21 Mbit/s. Fido Solutions has launched their LTE network in Halifax, Kentville, Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon, Kelowna, London, Hamilton, Sudbury, Timmins, Windsor, Vancouver, St. John's, Quebec City, Moncton and other urban areas. Services Since the company's inception, Fido offered unique services to differentiate itself from its competitors. Notably, its CityFido plans include either multiple or unlimited local calling minutes in certain zones throughout Canada. Fido was also the country's first and last mobile service provider to bill postpaid airtime by the second, while other companies round up calls to the next minute except for some grandfathered customers. The FidoDOLLARS program offers a selection of rewards to loyal customers. (FidoDOLLARS are equal to 4 percent of a customer's invoice before service charges (NSF, re- activation fee, administrative fees and taxes). As of April 2016, Fido phased out the FidoDOLLARS program. Fido also offers several plans and add-ons for mobile Internet access. =Voice plans= On November 4, 2008, Fido announced a re-branding and subsequent relaunch of their services due to competition from Koodo Mobile. This re-positioned the company as a discount wireless brand, offering postpaid plans virtually identical to those of Koodo with no system access fee or carrier-charged \\"911 fee\\". Clients using legacy plans, however, may keep them only if they continue to pay both fees. Current plans include 100, 200, 300, 500 or unlimited minutes incoming and outgoing calls (Canada-wide calls). The $50 unlimited plan replaces the previously available CityFido plans.Mobile  My Account Fido. Fido.ca. Retrieved on December 29, 2016. All current plans include the Caller ID, a basic voicemail service (mini voicemail), call waiting and conference call features, plus unlimited outgoing and incoming text (SMS) and picture/video (MMS) from the Fido network to standard numbers worldwide, at no extra cost. The Rogers-pioneered WhoCalled feature is available for an additional $7 monthly fee with the \\"Value Pack\\" add on. Circle Calling is also included, which allows \\"free calls between people on the same account\\", with a maximum beds of five people per account. They also offer a minute tracker, similar to the one used by Virgin Mobile Canada, to remind customers when they have used 75% and 100% of their monthly minutes. The CityFido Prepaid plan is now called the \\"in zone plan\\". It includes unlimited local calling while in the city of activation, plus unlimited text messages sent to standard Canadian numbers. The plan is now only available in Gatineau, London, Ontario, Ottawa and Toronto. It was previously offered in Quebec City, Montreal, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Victoria. Customers in these cities must now pay a $10 monthly surcharge to obtain a nearly identical \\"with no zone restrictions plan\\". Fido discontinued the CityFido plan for new postpaid customers. Fido Wireless Home Phone service was launched in mid-2013. Designed as an alternative to landline telephony, the service uses a ZTE access point to provide a connection between wired phones and Fido's network. The monthly plan features unlimited calling to and from Canada, Caller ID and voicemail. It costs $30/month on its own, but Fido postpaid customers pay $18/month instead. In the midwestern provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and in Quebec, the Wireless Home Phone is offered at a discounted rate of $10/month. Starting in 2018, Canadian wireless carriers, including Fido, changed the way they offer plans and devices, by separating the cost of each aspect. Previously, plan and device costs were bundled together as one price. This reduced transparency for consumers and made it difficult to understand. However, this new idea of \\"device financing\\" is currently being reviewed by the CRTC. As of November 2019, Fido' allows customers to pick a rate plan with different usage limits for talk, text and data. After which the user can choose a new device if interested as well as how much of the device cost they like to pay upfront. Device costs are spread out over a 2 year term. This means that user has to pay a fixed amount for their new device over the term. Once the term expires, monthly payment will decrease to the rate plan portion of the payment that has been made. =Mobile Internet= Fido offers several plans and add-ons for customers wishing to access Internet content via its mobile network using a BlackBerry, feature phone, mobile broadband modem, or smartphone. Unlimited mobile Internet access is only available on feature phones. It is no longer possible to pay per month for such access, as only daily and weekly Internet add-ons are unlimited. Smartphone add-ons, except for those BlackBerry-related, can be used on a feature phone. Smartphones can browse the Internet with a tiered add-on. This includes 100 MB for $10 and 2 GB for $25. If this allowance is exceeded, usage-based billing begins, costing $5 for an amount equivalent to that initially included with the add-on. Unique BlackBerry Internet Service options are available for BlackBerry smartphones. Unlimited BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) is included on all plans $35 or more, such as CityFido Unlimited. For all plans, it is also possible to pay an additional fee to add 100 MB or 2 GB of data. Note that the 100 MB option for BlackBerry devices costs $5 more than the regular smartphone add-on. Fido has been heavily criticized for discontinuing its unlimited Internet access plans and add-ons for devices other than feature phones. In response, the company occasionally releases a popular add-on, providing 6 GB of data for $30/month. It requires a voice plan and hence cannot be used with an Internet access stick. = Home internet = In November 2015, Fido began to offer cable internet services in selected markets. The service is a re-branded Rogers Hi-Speed Internet, offering a 30 Mbit/s package with a 300 GB bandwidth cap, with discounts as part of bundles with Fido post-paid mobile services. Fido internet is available to markets in Ontario that are served by Rogers' internet. The service is primarily aimed at millennials. =Loyalty program= Fido had a loyalty rewards program known as FidoDOLLARS. For every Fido monthly bill or prepaid top-up, a customers received 4% (previously 5% before September 6, 2012) of the pre-tax total in FidoDOLLARS.FidoRewards ‚Äì FidoDollars Decreased to 4% from 5%. Forums.redflagdeals.com (August 17, 2012). Retrieved on December 29, 2016. This currency would be used towards the purchase of a new device, purchase add-ons such as premium voicemail to text ($4), name display ($2) or #auto ($5) for a total of two months. As well as they were used to purchase travel packs as long as you had the full amount of fido dollars to do so. Prepaid customers would also use their FidoDOLLARS to purchase top-up credits. FidoDollars had no cash value and were non-transferable, except when transferring the responsibility of a number/contract from an account with only one line. With the release of Fido's new Pulse plans, FidoDOLLARS are no longer accumulated but existing FidoDOLLARS will remain on your account. However, if you are not on a Pulse plan you will continue to accumulate FidoDOLLARS as normal. To make up for the lack of FidoDOLLARS, Spotify Premium and Daily Vice are offered free of charge for 2 years ($239 value) in all new Pulse plans. In January 2016, Fido announced a winddown and termination of the FidoDOLLARS program. See the next section for more details. = Perks = As the FidoDOLLARS program was wound down, July 2017 saw the introduction of Fido's +5 Hours of Data, allowing customers on a pulse plan to enable 1 free hour of data, 5 individual times during each billing cycle. In May 2018, Fido introduced Fido XTRA which provides customers with perks from various retailers every Thursday. =Discontinued services= Fido once offered a wide range of services which it no longer offers. These have been discontinued either following the purchase of Fido by Rogers, or during \\"The New Fido\\" rebranding era. Unlimited mobile broadband while in Canada or the United States, older CityFido plans and Sprint Canada bundles were some of the plan options removed after Rogers purchased Microcell. The unlimited mobile Internet access plans were replaced by tiered and rationed Internet access options, although feature phones were still eligible for unlimited access until early 2012. Only some legacy CityFido plans were grandfathered, and Fido now has new CityFido offerings. Sprint Canada bundles with Fido were temporarily replaced by Better Choices Bundles after Rogers purchased both companies. Better Choices Bundles, couples plans, Danger Hiptop service, fax messaging, FullFido plans and mobile TV were all discontinued after \\"The New Fido\\" re-branding. Only some existing FullFido customers were grandfathered. The Better Choices Bundles program once offered up to 15% off a pre-tax Fido monthly bill when combined with one or more Rogers services, but Fido is now listed as a \\"service[] that do[es]n't qualify for the Better Choice Bundles‚Ñ¢ Program\\". Rogers Better Choice Bundles (click on \\"Eligibility\\") Couples plans were replaced by Circle Calling in 2011. Fax messaging was discontinued on September 22, 2007, but fax numbers could be ported out until December 22 of that year, and a similar service is still available at competitor Mike. The Mobile TV service offered up to 25 channels, but was discontinued due to a lack of subscribers. Competitors Bell Mobility and its MVNO Virgin Mobile Canada both offer a very similar feature called Bell Mobile TV. Per-second billing on Fido's postpaid monthly plans was discontinued on July 4, 2012. Customers with plans created and activated before that date are kept on per- second billing until they change to a newer plan. The company changed their plan offerings, now bundling data with their Smart plans, and Max Plans. CityFido plans had a cost of $35 per month and are available in ten select CityFido zones throughout Canada. Unlimited features included incoming calls, outgoing local calls, international SMS text messages and BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) service while inside any CityFido zone. In January 2016, Fido announced the termination of the FidoDOLLARS program. The earning of FidoDOLLARS ends on or shortly after April 6, 2016 for non-term monthly plans, and ends at the end of the current term for those FidoDOLLARS-earning plans that are on a contracted term. The non-term monthly customers were then told to use up (redeem) their FidoDOLLARS by July 6, 2016, whereas customers on a FidoDOLLARS-earning contracted term could redeem their FidoDOLLARS by July 6, 2018 (or else lose the FidoDOLLARS balance in both cases). Fido customers with multiple lines are deemed to be in the second category if at least one line is on a FidoDOLLARS-earning contracted term that goes beyond April 6, 2016. Many users in their community expressed dissatisfaction at the \\"scam\\" that their value had been arbitrarily taken by the company, or the only viable redemption option required a further contract.FidoDOLLARS Retail presence Rogers and Fido phones at 150px A sign of Fido, Rogers, and Chatr at 150px Fido has its own corporate retail stores, and also allows third parties to become exclusive dealers. For example, Best Buy, Costco, Tbooth, Walmart and WirelessWave sell Fido products along with prepaid and postpaid services. Additionally, Loblaw Companies and Zellers stores sold prepaid feature phones and top-up vouchers. Loblaw stores have a special booth, called The Mobile Shop, where the phones are displayed. =Former retailers= While Shoppers Drug Mart carried only Rogers Wireless prepaid phones at one time, the stores temporarily partnered with Rogers. As a result, Shoppers stores added both prepaid and postpaid products and services for Rogers and its two other brands, Fido and Chatr. Customers could also try out the iPhone 4. As of March 2011, however, Shoppers Drug Mart stores ended their partnership. They now only sell prepaid top-up vouchers for these providers.

It is a mounted unit and all of its soldiers are trained to care for and drive teams of six horses pulling each of six First World War-era QF 13-pounder guns used today to fire salutes on state occasions. Its duties include the firing of royal salutes on royal anniversaries and state occasions, and providing a gun carriage and team of black horses for state and military funerals. The unit is most often seen providing gun salutes on state occasions in Hyde Park, and Green Park. History The purpose-built Napier Lines barracks at Woolwich: home of the King's Troop since 2012 After the Second World War, King George VI expressed the view that, following the mechanisation of the last batteries of horse- drawn artillery, a troop of horse artillery should be retained to take part in the great ceremonies of state. Accordingly the Riding Troop was reformed on 17 April 1946 at Shoeburyness as a six-gun Royal Horse Artillery battery for the Household Division. At the suggestion of Brigadier John Anquetil Norman, the King declared that the Riding Troop would be known as 'The King's Troop'.Obituary of Brigadier J. A.

The Musical Drive can be seen at shows around the United Kingdom and always at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in May every year. Many of the manoeuvres of the Musical Drive have remained unchanged since it was first performed in 1897.

May (born 1953) is an American business executive, skier and enthusiast of other sports who was blinded by a chemical explosion at the age of three, but regained partial vision in 2000, at the age of 46, after cornea transplants and a pioneering stem cell procedure by San Francisco ophthalmologist Daniel Goodman. In 1999, May founded the Sendero Group in Davis, California, United States, which employs many individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Sendero has assisted those with sight disabilities by producing the first accessible GPS solution for blind persons. The Sendero Group's GPS technology received the Consumer Electronics Show's \\"Innovation Honoree\\" title in 2004 and 2009. Among his many accomplishments, May holds the record for downhill skiing by a person who is completely blind (racing at 65 mph). He competed in the alpine skiing event at the 1984 Winter Paralympics and won three bronze medals in the downhill, giant slalom, and combination events. May and his ex-wife, Jennifer, had two sons, Carson and Wyndham. Carson died while skiing, likely due to an avalanche, in January 2016. Recovery from blindness In 2003, three years after May's eye operation, the results were mixed. In terms of challenges, May reported being unable to grasp three-dimensional vision and to recognize members of his family by their faces alone. The effect of visual loss affects the development of the visual cortex of the brain‚Äîthe visual impairment causes the occipital lobe to lose its sensitivity in perceiving spatial processing. Siu and Morley (2008) proposed that following seven days of visual deprivation, a potential decrease in vision may occur. They also found an increasing degree of visual impairment following thirty-day and 120-day periods of deprivation. The Siu and Morley study suggests that the function of the brain is dependent upon visual input. May lost his eyesight at the age of three when his vision was not fully developed; he was not yet able to distinguish shapes, drawings, or images clearly. Consequently, it was anticipated that he would experience difficulty describing the outside world in comparison to a normal-sighted person. For example, it would be difficult for May to differentiate between complex shapes, dimensions, and the orientation of objects. Hannan (2006) hypothesized that the temporal visual cortex uses prior memory and experiences to make sense of shapes, colors, and forms. Hannan proposed that the long-term effect of blindness in the visual cortex is an inability to recognize spatial cues. At three years of age, May's vision had not reached the acuity of an adult; as a consequence, his brain was still not completely exposed to the full extent of clarity in relation to the images and light of the environment. Such impairment led to difficulties with regard to normal daily life. Cohen et al. (1997) suggested that early blindness causes the poor development of the visual cortex, with a resulting decrease in somatosensory development. Cohen's study proposed that May's long term blindness affects his ability to distinguish between faces of males and females, and to recognize pictures and images. In spite of the surgery on May's right eye, his newly regained vision is not fully recovered after forty years of blindness. Thinus-Blanc and Gaunet (1997) suggest that people who are blind early in life show a limited ability in the area of spatial representation. The impairment of May's visual cortex, due to the loss of his vision at a very early age, resulted in visual cortex cells that are not accustomed to the stimuli in his surroundings. However, Cohen et al. (1997) have proposed that, during their early years, blinded subjects develop a strong inclination for tactile discrimination tasks. Similarly, May has developed very precise senses of hearing and touch. Biography In 2006, journalist Robert Kurson wrote a book on May that was expanded from an article Kurson wrote for Esquire magazine. The book, Crashing Through: A True Story of Risk, Adventure and the Man Who Dared to See, was released on May 15, 2007. Film adaptation Interest was expressed within the film industry regarding the translation of May's story into a motion picture, and, as of July 2011, Stone Village Productions and DRO Entertainment owned the rights to the film adaptation of Kurson's book. Emmy Award-winning screenwriter, Adam Mazer, had been employed to write the script.

Until 17 March 1834, they were known as The Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners. Formation The corps was formed as the Troop of Gentlemen in 1509 by King Henry VIII to act as a mounted escort, armed with spear and lance to protect the sovereign, in battle or elsewhere. Henry decided to have \\"this new and sumptuous Troop of Gentlemen composed of cadets of noble families and the highest order of gentry as his personal Body Guard or 'Nearest Guard'\\", cadets being the younger sons of nobles. As his Body Guard, it accompanied Henry to France in 1513 and took part in the Battle of Guinegate (better known as the Battle of the Spurs) and then at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. In 1526, they became a dismounted bodyguard armed with battleaxes. They last saw service in battle during the English Civil War, during which a Gentleman Matthews saved the Prince of Wales at the Battle of Edgehill (1642) from one of the Earl of Essex's troopers. They were always intended as a primarily ceremonial unit, but were on regular duty until the 19th century. Under Henry VIII, the Troop of Gentlemen varied in size, according to funding available. As the \\"Nearest Guard\\" to the Monarch, the unit attracted an aristocratic and aspiring membership, which could be utilised as a cadre of young officers when levies were raised for overseas service. Duties Today, the duties are purely ceremonial: the Gentlemen accompany and attend the sovereign at various events and occasions, including state visits by heads of state, the opening of parliament, and ceremonies involving the various orders of chivalry, including the Order of the Garter. The Gentlemen now parade for the opening of parliament, state visits, royal garden parties, the Garter service, receptions of the diplomatic corps, royal weddings, coronations, the Investiture of the Prince of Wales, and lyings in state. They also have three mess dinners annually. Officers and administration The Corps today consists of five Officers (the Captain, the Lieutenant, the Standard Bearer, the Clerk of the Cheque and Adjutant and the Harbinger) and 27 Gentlemen. The senior Officer is the Captain, a political appointee who is now always the Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords. The senior permanent officer is the Lieutenant. The Clerk of the Cheque and Adjutant issues all orders to the Corps. The Harbinger runs the Mess and assists the Clerk. The Mess, at St. James's Palace, is run by a permanent Axekeeper and Butler also assisted by the house keeper. All Officers (except the Captain) must have served in the Corps prior to promotion to officer rank. In the 17th century, there was also the office of Paymaster of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms and Co-Paymaster of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms. Membership and age limits All subordinate officers, and all Gentlemen, must be under the age of 55 years on joining, and are on average 52. The Gentlemen retain their prior military ranks (currently most rank between major and colonel). They must retire at 70 years. Although all Gentlemen are retired officers, uniquely one recent member is also a clergyman. Colonel the Reverend Richard (\\"Dick\\") H. Whittington, MBE joined the Corps in 1999 after retiring from the Corps of Royal Engineers. He was ordained a deacon in 1993 and a priest in 1994. He was Chaplain of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 2001-13. Another notable Gentleman was Major Walter Clopton Wingfield, one of the pioneers of lawn tennis, who served from 1870 to 1909. Uniform The uniform of the Gentlemen at Arms, depicted on a cigarette card produced for the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937. The uniform is that of a Dragoon Guards officer of the 1840s. It has a skirted red coatee with Garter blue velvet cuffs and facings embroidered with the Tudor royal badge of the portcullis. Helmets with white swan feather plumes are worn when on duty, even in church. Officers wear, in addition, gold aiguillettes, and carry sticks of officegold for the Captain, silver for the Lieutenant, Standard Bearer and Clerk of the Cheque, and ivory for the Harbingerwhich they receive from the Sovereign on appointment. Cavalry swords are worn, and long ceremonial battle-axes, over 300 years old, are carried by all the Gentlemen. The uniforms are produced by the royal warrant holder Gieves & Hawkes from Savile Row in London. Standard The corps carries a standard, similar to that carried by cavalry and infantry regiments of the British Army, upon which is mounted the corps' various accoutrements and a selection of its battle honours. In the case of the Gentlemen at Arms, this is a swallowtailed standard of crimson edged in gold. The cross of St George is at the hoist. Next to this is the Royal Cipher of the reigning monarch, with the name of the corps (\\"Gentlemen at Arms\\") put diagonally from top to bottom. Between the two pieces of text is the corps' portcullis badge, while at the end of the standard are a selection of battle honours. In 2009, at a celebration of the Corps' 500 years of personal service to the Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II presented a special riband to be displayed on the Standard.Gentlemen at Arms speech, 4 June 2009 - British Monarchy Battle honours * 1513 Guinegate * 1520 Field of Cloth of GoldThe Field of Cloth of Gold was not actually a battle, but is listed by the Corps as a battle honour * 1544 Siege of Boulogne :Honours in bold are displayed on the corps' standard.

It is currently known as the Queen's Bodyguard For Scotland, and is located in Edinburgh, the capital city. The Royal Company of Archers has a long history in Scotland as a body that celebrated both the recreation and talent of local archers. As a body established by the Monarch, the Company has a long history of unique prizes, influential supporters, and ceremonial roles. Early history During the 17th and 18th centuries in Scotland, a muster or military rendezvous, called a \\"wapinschaw\\" (a weapon-showing) was held at least twice a year. Men were summoned by the sheriff and other civil magistrates to attend a muster in their respective counties at least 20 days in advance of the meeting. The civil magistrates, in conjunction with commissioners appointed by the King, supervised this body of militia, divided it into companies, and appointed captains. People of all stations were obligated to play their part in each rendezvous and to show up equipped in military gear that conformed to their respective ranks. The Lords and Barons were required to provide a list of the members of their company and the weapons they brought with them to the civil magistrates and King's commissioners. The commissioners then compiled a list of the whole muster, which was presented to the King.Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, p.272 By using the old laws of wapinschaw, the Jacobites formed a plan to institutionalise a military corps, under a pretext of sports and recreation, that could be assembled by an authority as occasion offered. A society for encouraging and exercising archery had already been formed in 1676, as a private archery club. This society sought and acquired the patronage of the Scottish Privy Council, which provided a prize that was shot for by the company's members. The company consisted of distinguished nobles and gentlemen of the day. The Marquis of Athole was the company's Captain-General in 1670; and they held frequent meetings during the reign of the royal brothers. No traces of this company exist for some time after the Glorious Revolution. Upon the accession of Queen Anne, and death of the Marquis of Athole, they appointed Sir George Mackenzie, then Lord Tarbat and Secretary of State, and afterwards Earl of Cromarty, their Captain-General. Having chosen a new leader, the society obtained from Queen Anne a charter under the Great Seal of Scotland, establishing it as a corporation by Letters Patent, dated 31 December 1713 into a Royal Company.Charles-Simon Favart, The Waverley anecdotes: Illustrative of the incidents, characters, and scenery, described in the novels and romances of Sir Walter Scott, Bart., Volume 1, London, 1833, p.364 These letters of patent: revived and ratified, on their behalf, the old laws and acts of Parliament that favored archery;In 1511, Henry VIII confirmed previous laws against illegal games in favour of archery gave them power to admit members, chose a President and council, appoint commanding officers, and to meet and act under their officers' supervision in military form for weapon- shawing as often as they should think convenient; and prohibited the civil magistrate from interrupting their activities. These rights and privileges were designed after the mode of feudal tenure, and to hold them in blanch fee (reddendo) of Her Majesty and her successors, therefore annually acknowledging a pair of barbed arrows. The society received these rights and privileges in its charter from Queen Anne in 1704.Frank Adam, Thomas Innes, The Clans, Septs and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands, 1934, p.330 In return for being endowed with \\"perpetual access to all public butts, plains and pasturages legally allotted for shooting arrows\\", the Royal Company is required to present to the Sovereign three barbed arrows on request. The first such weapon-shawing was held on 14 June 1714, with the Marquis of Athole as the Company's Captain-General, even though he was in his 80s by this time, and the Earl of Wemyss as Lieutenant-General at the head of about 50 archers.Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, p.273 On that occasion, the society shot a silver arrow, presented to them by the City of Edinburgh, at Leith. By the following year, the Company had doubled in number and was led by David Wemyss, 4th Earl of Wemyss after the death of the Marquis of Athole.Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, p.275 After the Jacobite rising of 1715 no parade was held for nine years, but they resumed under James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Hamilton on 4 August 1724 at Musselburgh.The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 102, Part 1, p.421 However, after 1734 public parades were discontinued until the Napoleonic Wars were over. Duties and traditions The Company's traditions relate to its reason for formation, the archery competition. To further this, it offers thirteen prizes that were at some time in the past competed for annually. Many are retained to the present day. =The Musselburgh Arrow= The tradition of shooting the silver Musselburgh Arrow, a small arrow presented by the town of Musselburgh in 1603, predates the creation of the Company and follows in the traditions of other burghs of Scotland. A new, large arrow was presented in 1713.Charles Lowe, The Graphic, The Royal Company of Archers, 9 August 1902, p.184 The victor of the shooting retains the arrow for a year, and on handing it over to the next victor appends a medal to the arrow with an engraved personal motto, all of which are held by the Company. One hundred three such medals were held by the Company by 1816. =Three Arrows= By the 1820s three more arrows were also presented by the cities of Peebles (1626), Selkirk (1675)Sir Walter Scott delivered the arrow into the hands of the Royal Company of Archers in 1818 and Edinburgh. The Edinburgh Arrow was presented by the City of Edinburgh in 1709, and the medals appended to it are in gold. The winner was at one time entitled to a prize of five pounds Sterling from the City, but this fell into abeyance after 1716. The 'Edinburgh Arrow' is an annual competition, known as the Sovereign's Prize since 28 July 1822, when it was competed for at the nearby Bruntsfield Links.Robert Huish, The public and private life of His late...Majesty, George the Third, London, 1821, p.495 It is the rule of the prize \\"1. That the said Silver Arrow be shot for at the rovers in Leith Links, upon the second Monday of June yearly, at ten of the clock in the forenoon if the day be favourable; and if not, that the shooting be adjourned to the next fair Monday.\\"Sir Paul James Balfour, The History of the Royal Company of Archers: The Queen's Body-guard for Scotland. W. Blackwood, 1875, p.315 16 June 2009 marked the 300th anniversary of the first competition for The Edinburgh Arrow. The three arrows are now depicted on one of the standards. Until the institution of the third prize, only a pair of arrows was presented to the Sovereign on demand,Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, pp.274 this now increased to three. =The Silver Punch bowl and Ladle= The fifth prize is The Silver Punch bowl and Ladle presented to the company in 1720, and likewise had medals appended to it by its winner.Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, pp.273‚Äì274 The Bowl made to the value of ¬£20, and the bill for its construction and the engraving on it came to ¬£22, 13s. 9d. sterling. It had inscribed on one side the common seal of the Company, and on the opposite side the reverse of the seal; and between those, on one side a Saint Andrew, and on the other the following inscription: \\"Edinburgh, 20th June 1720. ‚Äî The Councill of the Royall Company of Archers, viz., Mr David Drummond, Praeses, Thomas Kincaid, John Nairn, James Ross, Robert Lowis, John Lowis, John Carnegy, George Drummond, Tresr., William Murray and James Lowis, clerks, ordered this piece of plate to be furnished out of the stock of the Company, and to be shot for as ane annual pryze. at rovers by the said Company, as the Councill for the time shall appoint\\"Sir Paul James Balfour, The History of the Royal Company of Archers: The Queen's Body-guard for Scotland. W. Blackwood, 1875, p.322 =The Pagodas Medal= This prize consists of a medal, one of two which were presented to the Company in 1793 by Major James Spens, The 73rd Regiment (Royal Highland East Indies). They were made from fifty \\"pagodas\\", being part of the money actually paid by Tippu Sultan to the allies at the Treaty of Seringapatam in 1792. =Silver Vase and Gold Medal= A prize by the General John Earl of Hopetoun commemorating the 1822 visit by King George IV is also competed for annually on the king's or queen's birthday, and known as the Commemoration Prize.John Britton, Modern Athens, displayed in a series of views, or, Edinburgh in the Nineteenth century, London, 1829, p.17 =The Royal (Queen's) Prize of 20 Guineas= Since 1677 there has also been a competition for The Royal (Queen's) Prize for which ¬£20 is awarded on the condition that the winner contributes to the Company silver plate to the value of money received from the Crown.Sir Paul James Balfour, The History of the Royal Company of Archers: The Queen's Body-guard for Scotland. W. Blackwood, 1875, p.329 The condition is that the plate must bear the insignia of Archery. =The Silver Bugles= The ninth and tenth prizes are a pair of Silver Bugles, one presented to the Royal Company by one of the General Officers, Sir Henry Jardine, Knight, and which was shot for on 9 April 1830, for the first time. The second was presented later by the Sovereign's Bodyguard. =St. Andrew's Prize= St. Andrew's Cross, given in the 1840s by Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, of Coul, to the Royal Company, and called the \\"St.Andrew's Prize.\\" The above prizes were competed at the 180, 185 and 200 yards distance with two targets or 'clouts' as the aiming mark, one located at each end of the range.Edinburgh Guide, Edinburgh Events, 16 June 2009 Two further prizes are competed for 'at butts' or point blank distance.A flat trajectory of perhaps 150 yards. Into the 17th century 'direct level flight' meaning was alluded to by no less an author than Sir Walter Raleigh, in The History of the World, 1614: \\"Training his Archers to shoot compasse, who had bin accustomed to the point blanke.\\" Compass meant 'curved', as in the flight of an arrow over a long distance. =Prize of the Goose= The Prize of the Goose was competed for since 1703 and involved a live goose, requiring the winner to kill the goose when only its head protruded from the mark.Sir Paul James Balfour, The History of the Royal Company of Archers: The Queen's Body- guard for Scotland. W. Blackwood, 1875, p.313 The winner was to be known as the Captain of the Goose for a season. At some time in the history of the Company the above method was adopted for shooting for the prize of the Goose by inserting a small glass globe of about an inch in diameter in the centre of the butt-mark, which is a circular piece of cardboard, four inches in diameter. The competitor whose arrow first breaks this globe is declared \\" Captain of the Goose \\" for the year, and was awarded the other gold medal presented by Major Spens. =The Gold Medal= This is the more often competed for prize, the competition being held three times a year for three days each time, the scoring accounted in points like the usual archery competition. =Competition Rules= Members of the Company on parade at the landing of King George IV at Leith in 1822. Detail from a painting by Alexander Carse.Alexander Carse paintings, BBC, retrieved 12 October 2013 The Rules and Regulations of the Royal Company of Archers have never been printed, and, in fact, were never completed. The society may, therefore, be considered as \\"lawless\\" when within the precincts of their shooting ground. The main duties of the company are now ceremonial, and since the 1822 appointment as the Sovereign's 'Body Guard in Scotland' for George IV's visit to Edinburgh,Andrew Kippis, William Godwin, The New annual register, or General repository of history, politics, arts, sciences and literature for year 1822, London, 1823, p.161 include attending the Sovereign at various functions during the annual Royal Visit to Scotland when he or she approach within five miles of Edinburgh, including the Order of the Thistle investitures at The High Kirk of Edinburgh (St Giles Cathedral), the Royal Garden Party and the Ceremony of the Keys at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the presentation of new colours to Scottish regiments. At the Holyrood-house they provide corridor guard of honour. The Company arrives at the Holyrood-house by march at noon, preceded by their pipes and drums band, and holding the unstrung bows in their right hands. Initially they occupy the colonnades of the fa√ßade. The Royal Company of Archers outside Edinburgh Castle The Company has a march, the Archer's March composed by Allan Ramsay, which was played on special occasions. Sound, sound the music, sound it, Let hills and dales rebound it, Let hills and dales rebound it In praise of Archery. Used as a Game it pleases, The mind to joy it raises, And throws off all diseases Of lazy luxury. Now, now our care beguiling, When all the year looks smiling, When all the year looks smiling With healthful harmony. The sun in glory glowing, With morning dew bestowing Sweet fragrance, life, and growing To flowers and every tree. Tis now the archers royal, An hearty band and loyal, An hearty band and loyal, That in just thought agree, Appear in ancient bravery, Despising all base knavery, Which tends to bring in slavery, Souls worthy to live free. Sound, sound the music, sound it, Fill up the glass and round wi't, Fill up the glass and round wi't, Health and Prosperity To our great chief and officers, To our president and counsellors, To all who like their brave forbears Delight in Archery. Organisation The Royal Company of Archers has its base in Buccleuch Street, Edinburgh at Archers' Hall. Building commenced on 15 August 1776, and was completed by Alexander Laing in 1777. The Hall was extended in 1900 by A.F. Balfour Paul, and recently refurbished. The Hall consists of a hall, forty feet by twenty-four, and eighteen feet high; two rooms of eighteen by nineteen, and kitchen, cellars, lobby, and other apartments. The ground behind the house is laid out into a bowling-green, known as The Meadows or Hope Park, a spot deriving its name from Sir Thomas Hope,Ely Hargrove, Anecdotes of archery: from earliest ages to the year 1791, p.213 who drained and converted it into an archery ground, maintained by the Edinburgh Bowling Club. The Hall serves as a venue for various dinners and meetings of the company. The affairs of the Company are managed by a President and six counsellors, who are chosen annually by the whole membership. The Council is vested with the power of receiving or rejecting candidates for admission, and of appointing the company's officers, civil and military.Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, p.274 The structure of the organisation is divided between officers (including a Secretary, currently David Younger) and members. By seniority, the officers comprise one Captain-General, four Captains, four Lieutenants, four Ensigns and twelve Brigadiers. From the starting membership of 50 the number of the corps numbered about 1,000 in the late 18th century, but only exceeded five hundred by the 1930s. The Captain-General is the Gold Stick for Scotland.Frank Adam, Thomas Innes, The Clans, Septs and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands, 1934, p.331 In effect the size of the membership is more than that of a cadre light infantry battalion in low (reduced) establishment of three companiesSee for example reorganisation of Light Infantry in 1992 than a company,Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster, The Army in 1906: A Policy and a Vindication, p.57 and would equate more to the British Army regiment. Every officer of the Archers is of the rank of a general, and the privates of the corps rank at Court as colonels.

(William Beechey) Members of the Royal Company must be male and Scots or have strong Scottish connections. Membership is by election; the present membership totals around 530, with an active list of some 400 who pay an annual subscription of ¬£25. Company standards One of the current standards of the Royal Company of Archers The Company has two standards. The first of these bears on one side Mars and Cupid encircled in a wreath of thistles, with this motto: In peace and war. On the other, a yew tree, with two men dressed and equipped as archers, encircled as the former motto: Dal gloria vires (Glory Gives Strength). The other standard displays on one side, on a field or, a lion rampant gules, encircled with a double tressure flory-counter flory of the second (the Royal Arms of Scotland); on the top, a thistle and crown, motto: Nemo me impune lacessit (no one provokes me with impunity). On the other, St Andrew on the cross on field argent; at the top, a crown, motto: Dulce pro patria periculum (danger is sweet for one's country).Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, p.273-274 The three arrows on the standard were added after introduction of a third-place winner in the competition since 1720. Uniforms A reproduction of what the original uniform may have looked like in 1704. The Royal Company of Archers have the distinction of being the first military body of troops in the service of the British Crown who adopted tartan as a part of their uniform. The original uniform of the corps appears to have been a \\"shooting\\" dress, consisting of a tartan, lined with white, trimmed with green and white ribbons; a white sash, with green tossels; and a blue bonnet, with a St. Andrew's cross, a tartan coat, with knee-breeches and white vest; and a \\"common uniform\\", the coat of which was \\"a green lapelled frock.\\" Tartan was fashionable at the time as an expression of anti-Union and pro-Jacobite sentiment and many of the Company were known Jacobites. From 1713 to 1746 a red tartan sett was used for uniform, but it has not been satisfactorily settled as to what sett of tartan this was, though it was intended to be patterned on that worn by Prince Charles Edward Stuart. After 36 following the Battle of Culloden the Act of Proscription passed by Parliament which \\"proscribed or banned the making or wearing of Tartan cloths\\" was repealed, and from 1783 tartans were worn again. However, in 1789 the red tartan sett was discarded for the Black Watch one. In 1734 the headgear worn by the corps was a flat bonnet, ornamented with green and white feathers.Hugo Arnot, The history of Edinburgh, from the earliest accounts, to the year 1780, Edinburgh, 1816, p.274 Until 1823 (and possibly later) the Royal Company of Archers still wore tartan. Late in the 19th century when the Queen Victoria opened the Glasgow Exhibition, Her Majesty's Scottish Bodyguard wore their dark green tunics (formerly of the \\"Black Watch\\" tartan), with black braid facings and a narrow stripe of crimson velvet in the centre; shoulder wings and gauntleted cuffs similarly trimmed; dark green trousers with black and crimson stripe; a bow case worn as a sash, adorned with two arrows forming a St. Andrew's cross surmounted by a crown; a black leather waist-belt with richly chased gold clasp; a short, gilt-headed Roman sword, like an English bandsman's; Highland bonnet with thistle and one or more eagle feathers.Charles Lowe, The Royal Company of Archers, The Graphic, 9 August 1902, p.184 Their uniform until the Second World War, however has been a Court dress of green with gold embroidery, and cocked hat with a plume of dark cock's feathers. The officers' dress has gold embroidery, and their rank is indicated by two or, in the case of the captain, three, feathers being worn in the bonnet. The corps shooting dress is a dark-green tunic with crimson facings, shoulder-wings and gauntleted cuffs and dark-green trousers trimmed with black and crimson, a bow-case worn as a sash, of the same colour as the coat, black waistbelt with sword, Highland cap with thistle ornament and one or more eagle feathers, and a hunting knife. The weapon worn with this uniform is the sword.

In 1499, he served as the chief pilot in the expedition of Alonso de Ojeda to the coasts of South America. Upon his return to Andalusia, he drew his famous mappa mundi (\\"world map\\") and soon returned to the Indies, this time with Rodrigo de Bastidas. In the following years, De la Cosa alternated trips to America under its own command with special duties from the Crown, including an assignment as a spy in Lisbon and participation in the board of pilots held in Burgos in 1508. In 1509, he began what would be his last expedition, again with Ojeda, to take possession of the coasts of modern Colombia. De la Cosa died in an armed confrontation with indigenous people before he could get possession of Urab√°.  Origin and youth  Monument dedicated to Juan de la Cosa in Santo√±a, Cantabria. No one knows exactly where Juan de la Cosa was born, but the most accepted hypothesis is that it was in Santo√±a (Cantabria),C√°novas del Castillo y Vallejo, p.11 because there are documents showing that he was a resident there and his wife and daughter lived in that city. Some 16th-century chroniclers called him \\"the Biscayne\\", leading to confusion with another sailor called \\"Juan Vizcaino\\". However, today they are known to be different people.Le√≥n Guerrero, tomo 1, p.164 His date of birth is also unknown, but it is estimated between 1450 and 1460, nor is any information available from his childhood or adolescence. It is assumed that the young man took part in sailing voyages around the Bay of Biscay and then towards the Canary Islands and West Africa. The first solid references come from 1488, when Juan de la Cosa was in Portugal. At that time, navigator Bartolomeu Dias had just arrived in Lisbon, after having reached the Cape of Good Hope. The Catholic Monarchs may have sent de la Cosa to that city as a spy to obtain information and details of the discovery. He managed to return to Castile before Portuguese officers captured him. Early in the 1490s, Juan de la Cosa was living in El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a and owned a ship called Marigalante or Galician. It is believed that it was there that he established a business relationship with the Pinz√≥n brothers.  Early voyages Bust of Juan de la Cosa, Santo√±a According to some historians he was born in 1460 at Sta. Maria del Puerto (Santo√±a), in Cantabria, Spain. From early childhood he spent time on the water. From the waters of his native country, which he knew thoroughly, he soon ventured on to the coast of Western Africa, which was at that time the goal of many Spanish expeditions. The first reliable references place him in Portugal in 1488, meeting the explorer Bartolomeu Dias who had just sailed around the Cape of Good Hope.  Travels =Travels with Christopher Columbus= Juan de la Cosa sailed with Christopher Columbus on his first three voyages to the New World. He owned and was master of the Santa Mar√≠a (second-in-command to Columbus), flagship of Columbus's first voyage in 1492. The vessel shipwrecked that year on the night of 24‚Äì25 December off the present-day site of Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti. De la Cosa, in a notable act of cowardice (or treason, in Columbus's documented opinion), fled the sinking Santa Maria (his partial ownership of the vessel notwithstanding) in the flagship's boat, rather than endeavor to assist Columbus in kedging the stricken vessel from off the coral reef on which it had run aground. He and a handful of loyals made for La Nina, waiting a few hundred yards astern of the flagship, but they were turned back by La Nina's captain Vicente Yanez. On Columbus's second voyage, in 1493, de la Cosa was mariner and cartographer on the ship Colina. On Columbus' third voyage, in 1498, de la Cosa was on the ship La Ni√±a. Some historians believe de la Cosa did not participate in this voyage. In 1494 de la Cosa received compensation from the Spanish monarchs for the sinking of his ship on his first voyage. He was awarded the right to transport docientos cah√≠ces de trigo (\\"two hundred cahices of flour\\")A cahice was approximately 15 bushels. from Andalucia to Biscay, and exempted from certain duties. =First voyage with de Ojeda= On his fourth voyage, in 1499, de la Cosa was the first pilot for the expedition of Alonso de Ojeda and Amerigo Vespucci, and with them was among the first to set foot on the South American mainland on the Gulf of Paria. At the same time they explored the coast from Essequibo River to Cape Vela. In spite of not receiving much remuneration, De la Cosa had benefited considerably, having mapped in detail the coast of the region he explored, information he would use to create his famous map. On the fifth voyage, in 1500, de la Cosa, Rodrigo de Bastidas, and Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa explored the lands of present-day Colombia and Panama. He explored further along the South American coast to the isthmus of Panama, and returned to Haiti in 1502. When the Spanish court found soon afterwards that the Portuguese had made several incursions into the newly discovered country, Queen Isabella sent Juan de la Cosa at the head of a delegation to Portugal to protest this incursion. De la Cosa was arrested and incarcerated, liberated only with the help of Queen Isabella. =First independent voyage= De la Cosa was nominated an alguazil, and in 1504‚Äì05(?) (or 1506) was commander of an expedition to the Pearl Islands and the Gulf of Urab√° to found settlements there. At the same time he visited Jamaica and Haiti. =Second voyage with de Ojeda and de la Cosa's death= An 1887 illustration of de la Cosa's death In 1509 Juan de la Cosa set out for the seventh and last time for the New World. He carried two hundred colonists on three ships, and on reaching Haiti placed himself under the command of Alonso de Ojeda, who added another ship with one hundred settlers to the expedition. After having settled an old border dispute between Alonso de Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa, they went with Francisco Pizarro into de Ojeda's territory and landed at the future site of Cartagena. This was against the warnings of de la Cosa, who proposed they disembark on the more peaceful coast of the Gulf of Urab√°. When the Spanish came ashore, they got in a fight with the natives on the Bay of Calamar, and drove them off. Emboldened by the Spanish victory, de Ojeda decided to go further into the forest, to the native village at the future site of Turbaco. When they arrived at the town, they were attacked by the natives, and de la Cosa was shot with poison arrows and killed. De Ojeda escaped, and fled to the coast. Another Spanish expedition passed by, and de Ojeda told them of the murderous natives. The men of the other expedition joined de Ojeda for a punitive attack on that village, killing all of its inhabitants to avenge de la Cosa's death. De la Cosa's widow received 45,000 maraved√≠s and all the natives he had in his possession as indemnity for services rendered.  Cartography  Map of Juan de la Cosa. Juan de la Cosa made several maps of which the only survivor is his famous world map from 1500. It is the oldest known European map that shows the New World. Of special interest is the outline of Cuba, which Christopher Columbus never believed to be an island. Walkenaer and Alexander von Humboldt were the first to point out the great importance of this chart. It is now in the Museo Naval in Madrid. Reproductions of it were first given by Humboldt in his Atlas g√©ographique et physique.

It was first broadcast on 5 January 1948 on the BBC Light Programme, which became Radio 2 in 1967; it ran until 25 April 1969. A new episode was broadcast each weekday afternoon, with a repeat the following morning. A few days after the final episode, a new serial drama, Waggoners' Walk, took over the time slot. The main scriptwriter for many years was Jonquil Antony, and her first collaborator (under a pseudonym) was Ted Willis, later to create Dixon of Dock Green. The lead character, Mrs Dale, was played by Ellis Powell until she was sacked in controversial circumstances in 1963 and replaced by Jessie Matthews.  Format  An innovative characteristic of the programme was that a brief introductory narrative in each episode was spoken by Mrs Dale as if she were writing her diary. The serial centred on Mrs Mary Dale, a doctor's wife, husband Jim, and the comings and goings of a middle class society. The Dales lived at Virginia Lodge in the fictional London Metro-land-style suburb of Parkwood Hill. They had moved there from the real area of Kenton, which straddles the border between the London boroughs of Brent and Harrow. Later in the series, to modernise the programme and its setting, the producers relocated the family in the fictional new town of Exton New Town. Mrs Dale's mother was Mrs Rosemary Freeman, whom Jim always called, rather gravely, \\"mother-in-law\\". Dr and Mrs Dale had a daughter, Gwen, and a son, Bob, who worked in the motor trade. He was married to Jenny; they had twins. Gwen was widowed after her husband David was killed in a water-skiing accident in the Bahamas where he was holidaying with his rich mistress. Mary Dale's sister, Sally, (which she always pronounced \\"Selly\\") lived in Chelsea and moved in exotic circles. The Dales and their friends (along with Captain - Mrs Freeman's cat - apparently named after the rank of her late husband, who had been killed in the First World War) got along in almost perfect harmony. It was all respectable, comfortable and middle-class. Treatment of homosexuality The programme is thought to be the first British mainstream drama which depicted a character known to be homosexual sympathetically in a leading part - Sally's husband. It was a brave move to feature a gay man, especially when homosexuality was still illegal in the United Kingdom. Clearly the programme's makers considered the time was right for the subject to be featured. Richard Fulton, however, was an odd character to use, in several ways. Not least is that (though apparently based on the homosexual writer Patrick White) Richard's history in the serial was heterosexual. He was in fact a character who had developed a lot, having been presented in the early days as a monster of petulance.  Changes to the format  On 26 February 1962, the serial was renamed The Dales. The linking narratives by Mrs Dale were dropped. The reason was that the BBC was conscious that the series was considered by the media to be twee and hopelessly old fashioned. The changes included a new theme tune composed by Ron Grainer, composer of the theme music for Doctor Who. \\"Dance in the Twilight\\" from Eric Coates' Springtime Suite also served as a signature tune for a time. In 1975, Matthews's biographer, Michael Thornton, wrote: > \\"On 19 February, 1963, a plump and embittered fifty-six-year-old character > actress called Ellis Powell walked out of Broadcasting House for the last > time.

Mrs Dale became a councillor, a position she had to give up after she had caused a man's death by careless driving. A heart attack forced Dr Dale to retire from practice. Perhaps the most famous storyline was Jenny's getting measles; listeners wrote in thousands complaining that she had already had measles in 1949. When it became The Dales, the show did try to copy The Archers, which was originally a medium to disseminate information to the agricultural community, and to give an insight into rural affairs to the public. In The Dales the plots now revolved around medical conditions and problems. When the series ran a story about the importance of women having regular cervical smear tests and checking their breasts for lumps, the junior health minister praised the programme, saying it had encouraged thousands of women to see their doctor. The serial ran for 5,531 episodes, culminating with the engagement of Mrs Dale's daughter Gwen to a famous TV professor on 25 April 1969. On news of its demise, Liberal MP Peter Bessell attempted to introduce a reprieve for the series in Parliament. The BBC Sound Archive holds only five complete episodes of Mrs Dale's Diary, and seven complete episodes of The Dales. Spin-offs Over the years it ran there were a number of books written around the characters, several authored in whole or part by Jonquil Antony, the most important scriptwriter at the beginning and for many years. In 1970, the year after the programme finished, she took back her former characters after a fashion, publishing Dear Dr. Dale, a novel set after the end of the serial. In the same year Charles Simon, who had played Dr Dale in the Jessie Matthews years, did his own continuation of the story, going on tour in At Home With The Dales. This show has its place in theatre history as the first professional venture of Cameron Mackintosh, later renowned for large-scale musicals. The Dales play was written by Charles Henry, who was soon discovered to be the versatile and experienced Charles Simon. Later dates in the tour were cancelled because the audience did not seem to be there. \\"It would have been different if Jessie had done the tour\\" Charles Simon remarked a few months later (to actor Roger Sansom, with whom he was in a broadcast). He was, however, the only member of the radio cast to make the transition. The play was published, but has seldom been revived. In 1972 it received an amateur production at Rugby Theatre, with Bridget Watson as Mrs Dale and Harry Roberts as her husband the doctor. The only professional revival seems to have been in 1997 at the Kenneth More Studio Theatre in Ilford, when Angela Ellis and Roger Braban played the senior Dales. Catchphrase The phrase seized on by caricaturists as typical of Mrs Dale's narrative was \\"I'm rather worried about Jim...\\" Indeed, the phrase was a staple of many comedy programmes, radio and television, in the early 1960s aiming to poke fun at safe, staid and undemanding middle-class lifestyles. The last episode ended with Mrs Dale saying, \\"There's one thing that won't change - I shall always worry about Jim...\\"  Parodies  =Mrs Wilson's Diary= Mrs Dale's Diary was the basis of Mrs Wilson's Diary in the fortnightly satirical magazine Private Eye. The writers (primarily John Wells) presented Mrs Wilson as seeing herself as comfortably middle class, in contrast to the working class pretensions (and middle class actuality) of her husband, for example the Wincarnis (a brand of tonic wine) and the worsted suits with two pairs of trousers (Wilson was from Huddersfield, a town known for the manufacture of worsted cloth). =Goon Show= The show was mentioned in the following episodes of The Goon Show: * In an untitled episode (s02 e01 - 22 January 1952), listeners are given an example of how Mrs Dale's Diary would sound as produced by Americans. It includes over-hyped music, multiple in-show advertisements for bizarrely named products, and ends with several murders. * In The Man Who Tried To Destroy London's Monuments, (s04 ep02 - 9 October 1953), Eccles regains consciousness and is told he is in Mrs Dale's Diary. * Nineteen Eighty-Five, (s05 ep15 - 5 January 1955), in which mention is made of Mrs Dale's Real Diary: :Seagoon: I want to read it. What's it called? :Bluebottle: It's called Mrs Dale's Real Diary. :Seagoon: Mrs Dale's...?? Heavens  would the BBC stop at nothing? So this was how they kept the masses from thinking. :Bluebottle: Eheehee! Look at this page! Eheehee! It's a Three-D picture of Mrs Dale in her nightshirt being chased by Richard Dimbleby... Eheehee! Eheeheehee! Eheeheeoooooughhhh... pauses to wipe drool off chin. It was also one of the recordings used for torture in the BBC Listening Room, that episode's parody of Room 101. * The History of Pliny the Elder (s07 ep25 - 28 March 1957): :Seagoon: Fear not! We shall fight them up hill and down Mrs Dale! =Round the Horne= * The programme was often a 'target' (albeit an affectionate one) on the BBC Radio comedy Round the Horne, referred to as \\"Mrs Dire's Dreary\\", with the part of Mrs Dire being played by Kenneth Williams.

Her murderer was never caught. Biography Niemans was born in Amsterdam-West on 27 September 1927. Her father, a shoemaker, was Hendricus Johannes Niemans (born 1899) and her mother was Sebilla Alida Johanna Streelder (born 1900). When she was young, her chronically ill mother was admitted to hospital. Niemans and her elder brother were sent to the Groot Kijkduin children's home in Zandvoort. When the Germans occupied the area in WW2, Niemans and her brother went back to Amsterdam to live with their father, who had by now a new wife. Niemans did not get on with her step-mother. She left home looking for a job and accommodation. Through a fortune teller and an Italian sailor, who was, in fact, a pimp, she entered prostitution in the Kerkstraat. Following a police investigation, she returned to her father and stepmother and started training in dressmaking. In 1948, Niemans moved to the Hague, where she rented a window at 21 Doubletstraat and returned to prostitution. Soon after she moved to 71 Scheldestraat. In 1950 she brought a house at 498 Nieuwe Haven. She was originally known as Black Dolly (Dutch: Zwart Dolly) from her dark hair, but later bleached it. Later in 1950 she married Botto van den Bergh, a violinist in Hague's Residentie Orchestra. She accompanied her husband when he was travelling with the orchestra, and was introduced to classical music and the fashion and art worlds. She occasionally worked as a fashion model. Their marriage broke down after a year and, following a lengthy and complex legal procedure, the couple were divorced in 1957. Murder Niemans was found dead in bed in her house on the Nieuwe Haven on 2 November 1959. It was estimated that she had been strangled on the night of 30/31 October. There were no signs of violence and a considerable amount of cash was found in the building by the police. Robbery was ruled out as a motive for the crime. She was buried in the Westduin Cemetery in The Hague South. The murder of Blonde Dolly sparked a considerable stir. There was speculation that her \\"blue book\\" contained names of high-ranking regular customers. The police refused to release the notebook. This caused rumours that one of these high-ranking people would be involved in her murder. No evidence to substantiate these rumours was ever presented, nor that of a political cover-up. The international press picked up the case, linking it to the murder in Germany of Rosemarie Nitribitt in 1957, in which there were also allegations of politicians being involved. The main suspect in the case was a bodyguard named \\"Gerard V\\", whose services Niemans had used after another prostitute, Marietje van Es, has been robbed nearby in December 1958. He had fallen in love with Niemans but she had rejected him. He was never charged, and the investigation closed. According to the politician Hans Gualth√©rie van Weezel, his father, the police commissioner Jan Gualth√©rie van Weezel, knew who had committed the murder. Gualth√©rie van Weezel Sr. would keep a file on the case at home with the instruction to destroy it after his death. Before carrying out this instruction, Gualth√©rie van Weezel jr. Would have read the name of the perpetrator in the file. In popular culture The life and death of Blonde Dolly was incorporated in Michel Dubois' novel Murder on Black Martha (1962), and was portrayed in director Gerrit van Elst 's film Blonde Dolly (1987). Casper Postmaa wrote a book about the case. In 2019 appeared Blonde Dolly by Tomas Ross with new details about the murder.

The city of Rajgir (ancient RƒÅjag·πõha; Pali: RƒÅjagaha) was the first capital of the kingdom of Magadha, a state that would eventually evolve into the Mauryan Empire. The city finds mention in India's greatest literary epic, the Mahabharata, through its king Jarasandha. Its date of origin is unknown, although ceramics dating to about 1000 BC have been found in the city. The famous 2,500-year old Cyclopean Wall is located in the city. This area is also notable in Jainism and Buddhism.Jain Dharma ka Maulik Itihas Part-1, Ed. Acharyashri Hastimalji Maharaj, 1971 p. 739-742 It was the birthplace of the 20th Jain Tirthankar Munisuvrata, and is closely associated with the arihant Mahavira and Gautama Buddha. Both Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha taught their beliefs in Rajgir during the 6th and 5th century BC. The ancient Nalanda university was located in the vicinity of Rajgir, and the contemporary Nalanda University named after it was founded in 2010 at Rajgir. It was also through Rajgir that the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka travelled to Bodh Gaya around 250 BC, when placing the diamond throne (Vajrasana) at the great temple where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. History King Bimbisara welcomes Buddha in Rajagriha Rajgir is also famous for its association with Haryanka dynasty Kings Bimbisara (558‚Äì491 BC) and Ajatashatru (492‚Äì460 BC) as their capital city. Ajatashatru kept his father Bimbsara in captivity here. The sources do not agree which of the Buddha's royal contemporaries, Bimbisara and Ajatashatru, was responsible for its construction. Ajatashatru is also credited with moving the capital to Pataliputra (modern Patna). The name Rajgir came from RƒÅjag·πõiha, meaning \\"house of the king\\" or \\"royal house\\", or the word Rajgir might have its origin in its plain literal meaning, \\"royal mountain\\". It was the ancient capital city of the Magadha kings until the 5th century BC when Udayin(460‚Äì440 BC), son of Ajatshatru, moved the capital to Pataliputra. In those days, it was called Rajgriha, which translates as 'the home of Royalty'. Shishunaga (413-395 BC) founded Shishunaga dynasty in 413 BCE with Rajgir as its initial capital before it was moved to Pataliputra. The epic Mahabharata calls it Girivraja and recount the story of its king, Jarasandha, and his battle with the Pandava brothers and their allies Krishna. Jarasandha who hailed from this place, had been defeated by Krishna 17 times. The 18th time Krishna left the battlefield without fighting.See Bhagavata Purana, 10.70.30 Because of this Krishna is also called 'ranachorh' (one who has left the battlefield). Mahabharata recounts a wrestling match between Bhima (one of the Pandavas) and Jarasandha, the then king of Magadha. Jarasandha was invincible as his body could rejoin any dismembered limbs. According to the legend, Bhim split Jarasandha into two and threw the two halves facing opposite to each other so that they could not join. There is a famous Jarasandha's Akhara (place where martial arts are practiced). It is also mentioned in Jain and Buddhist scriptures, which give a series of place-names, but without geographical context. The attempt to locate these places is based largely on reference to them and to other locations in the works of Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, particularly Faxian and Xuanzang. It is on the basis of Xuanzang in particular that the site is divided into Old and New Rajgir. The former lies within a valley and is surrounded by low-lying hills, Rajgir hills. It is defined by an earthen embankment (the Inner Fortification), with which is associated the Outer Fortification, a complex of cyclopean walls that runs (with large breaks) along the crest of the hills. New Rajgir is defined by another, larger, embankment outside the northern entrance of the valley and next to the modern town. It was here that Gautama Buddha spent several months meditating, and preaching at Gridhra-kuta, ('Hill of the Vultures'). He also delivered some of his famous sermons and initiated king Bimbisara of Magadha and countless others to Buddhism. It was here that Budhha delivered his famous Atanatiya Sutra. On one of the hills is the Saptaparni Cave where the First Buddhist Council was held under the leadership of Maha Kassapa. It is sacred to the memory of the founders of both the religions: Jainism and Buddhism and associated with both the historical Mahavira and Buddha. Lord Mahavira, 24th Tirthankara spent fourteen years of his life at Rajgir and Nalanda, spending Chaturmas (i.e. 4 months of the rainy season) at a single place in Rajgir (Rajgruhi) and the rest in the places in the vicinity. It was the capital of one of his Shravaks(follower) King Shrenik. Thus Rajgir is a very important religious place for Jains. The twentieth Jain tirthankara, Munisuvrata is supposed to have been born here. An ancient temple(about 1200 years old) dedicated to Munisuvrat bhagwan is also present here along with many other Jain temples. This temple is also a place for four Kalyanakas of Bhagwan Munisuvratnath. Geography and climate The city is in a valley surrounded by seven hills: Vaibhara, Ratna, Saila, Sona, Udaya, Chhatha, and Vipula. River Panchane flows through the outskirts of the town. Rajgir has also developed as a health and winter resort due to its warm water ponds. These baths are said to contain some medicinal properties that help in the cure of many skin diseases. Another attraction of the region is the ropeway that leads uphill to the Vishwa Shanti Stupa (Peace Pagoda), Makhdoom Kund and monasteries built by Japanese devotees of the Buddha on top of the Ratnagiri Hills. Temperature: maximum 44 ¬∞C (111.2 ¬∞F), minimum 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F). Winter temperature: maximum 28 ¬∞C (82.4 ¬∞F), minimum 6 ¬∞C (42.8 ¬∞F). Rainfall: 1,860 mm (mid-June to mid-September) Dry/warm season: October to March Demographics According to 2011 Indian Census, Rajgir had a total population of 41,587, of which 21,869 were males and 19,718 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 6,922. The total number of literates in Rajgir was 24,121, which constituted 58.0% of the population with male literacy of 65.4% and female literacy of 49.8%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Rajgir was 69.6%, of which male literacy rate was 78.1% and female literacy rate was 60.1%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 11,724 and 42 respectively. Rajgir had 7030 households in 2011. As of the 2011 India census, Rajgir had a population of 41,587. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Rajgir has an average literacy rate of 52%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 61%, and female literacy is 41%. In Rajgir, 19% of the population is under 6 years of age. Notable places Naulakha Jain Mandir The renowned Son Bhandar Caves is situated at Rajgir, Nalanda district in Bihar state. Son Bhandar group of caves has two caves known as eastern and western cave. Son bhandar caves are concerned with Jainism and considered to belong to 3‚Äì4 century AD. Hot Springs Bath- Brahmakunda and Laxminarayan Temple Complex These caves were first inspected by Cunninghum and he concluded to have analogy with Saptaparni Cave of Buddhism creed. After Cunninghum several scholars visited this place and some had opinion to concern with Buddhism. After some time all Buddhism connections were refused because of an inscription found on the southern wall of a cave. According to this inscription these caves were built by inspiration of a Jain Muni Vair for Jain ascetics. Sculptures of Teerthankaras were also carved in these caves. From architectural aspect; these caves are analogous to Nagarjuni cave and Barabar Caves caves of Mauryan era. Therefore, it can be concluded that construction time should not be much differ from above mentioned caves. These caves should be related to Digambar sect of Jainism as Xuanzang wrote in his book about Vaibhar Hill of Rajgir that the place was occupied by Digambar Jain monks for meditation purpose. After some centuries these caves were converted by Hindus as Lord Vishnu sculpture was also found from mound of a cave.History behind Son Bhandar cave of Rajgir. JainGlory.com Historically, Rajgir has been a very important place in Jainism, as capital to many empires. The main tourist attractions include the ancient city walls from Ajatshatru's period, the Bimbisar's Jail, Jarasandh's Akhara, Gridhra-kuta, ('Hill of the Vultures'), Son Bhandar CavesMiddle Land, Middle Way: A Pilgrim's Guide to the Buddha's India, Shravasti Dhammika, Buddhist Publication Society, 1992 p. 98 and the Jain temples on the five peaks.

Early life  Maria Swanenburg was the daughter of Clemens Swanenburg and Johanna Dingjan. After Maria's first two daughters died at a young age, she married Johannes van der Linden on 13 May 1868. The result of this marriage was five sons and two daughters. The marriage lasted until 29 January 1886. Her nickname was \\"Goeie Mie\\" (Good Mie), which she received because of her amicable neighborly assistance in babysitting and taking care of the sick and elderly in Leiden's poor neighborhood, where she herself lived.  Murders  Her first victim was her own mother, in 1880; not long thereafter she poisoned her father as well. It was established with certainty that at least 102 people were poisoned with arsenic between 1880 and 1883. Twenty-seven of her victims were killed, of whom 16 were her relatives. The investigation included more than 90 suspicious deaths. Forty-five survivors sustained chronic health issues after having ingested the poison. Swanenburg's motive was the payout of her victims' insurance or their inheritance. She had secured most of the insurance policies herself. = Capture and imprisonment = Swanenburg was caught after she poisoned the Frankhuizen family in December 1883. Her trial began on 23 April 1885. Swanenburg was found guilty of having killed at least three victims and she was sentenced to life imprisonment in a correctional facility, where she died in 1915.

The River Lagan forms much of the border between County Antrim and County Down in the east of Ulster. It rises as a tiny, fast-moving stream near to the summit of Slieve Croob; Transmitter Road runs nearby. It runs to Belfast through Dromara, Donaghcloney and Dromore. On the lower slopes of the mountain, it combines with a branch from Legananny Mountain, just opposite Slieve Croob. The river then turns east to Magheralin into a broad plain between the plateaus of Antrim and Down. The river drains approximately 609 square km of agricultural land and flows over 70 km from the Mourne Mountains to the Stranmillis Weir, from which point on it is estuarine. The catchment consists mainly of enriched agricultural grassland in the upper parts, with a lower section draining urban Belfast and Lisburn. There is one significant tributary, the Ravernet River, and there are several minor tributaries, including the Carryduff River, the River Farset and the Blackstaff River. Water quality is generally fair, though there are localised problems and occasional pollution incidents, mainly due to effluent from farms. Work is proceeding to restore a self-sustaining population of Atlantic salmon to the river. History Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) described a river called ŒõŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ± (Logia). The river name is thought to connect with Old Irish loeg (\\"calf\\") and with *laks (\\"salmon\\").http://www.romaneranames.uk/essays/ireland.pdf The Lagan in Belfast River Lagan and Lanyon Place, Belfast, October 2009 Lagan Weir, Belfast, October 2009 The name Belfast originates from the Irish B√©al Feirste, or the mouth of the Farset, the river on which the city was built and which flows into the Lagan. The Farset has been superseded by the River Lagan as the most important river. The Farset languishes in obscurity, covered over by the city's High Street. =Laganside Corporation= In 1989 the Laganside Corporation was established by the British government to redevelop the areas surrounding the Lagan in Belfast. Major developments of the Laganside Corporation along the river include the regeneration of the city's former Gasworks, the Odyssey entertainment and leisure development, and the Lanyon Place development, which includes the Waterfront Hall, in many ways the flagship of the corporation. =Lagan Weir= One of the earliest and most important undertakings of the Corporation was the Lagan Weir. Completed in 1994 at a cost of ¬£14m, the weir controls the level of water upstream. One of the main functions of the weir was to reduce unsightly mud flats at low tide. This was mostly successful, but mud flats are still evident on the river. The weir is a series of massive steel barriers which are raised as the tide retreats so as to keep the river at an artificially constant level. Lagan Weir, dredging and aeration have increased water quality in the river, and salmon are returning. An otter and seals have followed the fish that now move up river to spawn in what was once an aquatic death trap. =Sport= The river is used by a number of rowing clubs, including Queen's University Boat Club, Queen's Ladies Boat Club, Methodist College Boat Club, Royal Belfast Academical Institution (RBAI) Rowing Club, Belfast Rowing Club (BRC) and Lagan Scullers Club (). The Boathouses are all based between the Governors Bridge and the Stranmillis Weir. =Dredging= In September 2010, dredging commenced on the river Lagan. The operation was expected to last until spring 2011. The Lagan in Lisburn In a similar way to the regeneration of Belfast riverside Lisburn City Council has embarked on a series of developments around the River Lagan. The centre-piece of this strategy has been the Lagan Valley Island complex; a new headquarters for the council and an Arts Centre, wedding and conference facilities and a restaurant. Opened in 2001 the building is surrounded by the Lagan on one side and a channel linked to the river on the other. The Lagan Navigation The old Lagan Navigational Canal (disused) at Broadwater, near Aghalee. (The disused canal is not now part of River Lagan, part of The Lagan River was a part of this canal, giving the old canal its name.) In the late 19th century the Lagan Navigation was built from Lough Neagh to Belfast, using some of the river as a navigable waterway and diverting water from other areas to supply separate canal sections. However, by the mid-20th century the route had fallen into disuse and was largely derelict. The M1 motorway (Northern Ireland) was built across the route. Currently, the section of the navigation's towpath running from Lisburn to almost the centre of Belfast has been restored. The Lagan at Drumbeg. Angling Atlantic salmon became extirpated in the River Lagan, which enters the Irish Sea through the port of Belfast, between 1750 and 1800, coinciding with a period of major population growth, industrialisation and the construction of a navigable waterway based on the river. The latest record of a salmon population in the river dates from 1744. From 1950 to 1990, water quality in the river improved as a result of improved sewage treatment, the Lagan Navigation was abandoned and fell into disuse, and many industrial effluents were diverted to sewer. A fish survey in the early 1970s found no fish at all in the urban reach of river through Belfast. Brown trout and several other species remained present in the upper reaches of the river throughout the worst of the downstream urban problems. The 1980s saw some recreational angling for non-migratory fish developing in the Belfast reaches of the river, and there were very occasional reports of migratory salmon or sea trout being seen in the river. In 1991, the first of a series of stockings took place and the first adult salmon returned to the Lagan in 1993. Wildlife Plants such as Elodea and others have been recorded from the Lagan.Hackney, P. (Ed) 1993. Stewart and Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland. Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast. (HB) The river also hosts a population otters and a variety of wildfowl. A breeding population of yellow bellied slider turtles also live in the river, thought to be abandoned pets. A seal locally known as Sammy the Seal may often be seen swimming up the river as far upstream as Minnowburn. See also *List of rivers of Northern Ireland References Further reading Simon, B. 2011.

They were active until 1980, followed by a reformation between 1992‚Äì1999, and are currently active following a 2016 reunion. Members have included John Goodsall (guitar), Percy Jones (bass), Robin Lumley (keyboards) and Phil Collins (drums). Goodsall and Jones were the sole constant members throughout the band's existence until October 2020, when Jones left the band.https://www.loudersound.com/news/percy-jones-quits-brand-x History =1975‚Äì1980: First incarnation= Brand X co-founder Percy Jones In December 1974, Genesis drummer Phil Collins was invited to rehearsals with a developing five-piece instrumental jazz fusion group at Island Studios in London, which included Percy Jones on bass. They had secured a recording deal with Island Records and prepared tracks for a studio album which originally included vocals. However, the vocals were negatively received from Island management, leaving the group to write new material, at the suggestion of Island A&R; man Richard Williams. After Collins left for Genesis commitments, the line-up changed from Jones, John Goodsall on guitar, Robin Lumley on keyboards and vocals, Pete Bonas on guitar, and John Dillon on drums and percussion, to a departing Bonas and Dillon, the latter replaced by Phil Spinelli for a short time before a newly available Collins took his place in April 1975. The four recorded Unorthodox Behaviour in September and October 1975 at Trident Studios with Jack Lancaster on saxophone. They were named Brand X after Island Records staffer Danny Wilding wrote down \\"Brand X\\" to keep track of their activity on the studio calendar, and the name stuck. In preparation for their upcoming gigs, the four were joined by Geoff Seopardi on percussion by December 1975. Genesis manager Tony Smith became their manager. Brand X played their first gigs with a series of low key warm-up shows in November and December 1975. These were followed by a full-scale tour across the UK from February 1976, mainly on the college circuit. They had little funds, resorting to renting a synthesiser and PA system, operated with a small road crew, and often played support for the headlining act. In December 1976, the band returned to Trident Studios to record their second album Moroccan Roll, by which time percussionist Morris Pert joined the band full-time. They had previously employed Gaspar Lawal, Bill Bruford, and Preston Heyman for the position, but each operated in an unofficial capacity. Moroccan Roll was released in April 1977 and peaked at No. 37 in the UK and No. 125 in the US. With Collins leaving the group for Genesis commitments, Kenwood Dennard of Pat Martino's group was recruited in New York City in time for their 32-date US tour in May and June 1977. Collins briefly returned later in 1977 for a series of dates, including a spot at the tenth Crystal Palace Garden Party in London and the F√™te de l'Humanit√© in Paris on the same day on a specially chartered plane, the latter attended by an estimated 200,000 people. Following the completion of the two albums, Clark and Pert departed the band, and the remaining six members recorded another album, 1982's Is There Anything About?, which would be the final album to feature both Lumley and Collins, and which would not be released until two and a half years after the band's dissolution. Following the completion of the recording sessions, the band embarked on a world tour, following which Collins departed for the final time. Clark returned to the drum stool, and the band toured the UK in April and May 1980 (co-headlining with Bruford).

It operates from Brunswick East to St Kilda Beach. The 13.9 kilometre route is operated by C2 and E class trams from Southbank depot.Facts & figures Yarra TramsRoute 96 Yarra Trams It is one of Melbourne's busiest tram routes, carrying 53,000 passengers every week day with a frequency of up to every 4-6 minutes during peak times. It has been described as one of the world's top 10 tram rides, highly popular with both commuters and tourists visiting St Kilda's many attractions and special events including the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix and the St Kilda Festival. The route began electric operation on 6 May 1956, with the reintroduction of trams on Bourke Street. It was extended to St Kilda on 20 November 1987,Metlines - March 1988 with the conversion of the St Kilda railway line to a light rail. As a result, it has a lengthy right of way between Melbourne and St Kilda, although the majority of the route is on-road. End to end services take about 50 minutes. Frequent overcrowding problems have seen route 96 become the only route to run the C2 class tram, specifically designed to carry more passengers, complementing the E Class trams. Due to its high usage, the route was chosen in April 2012 to undergo major infrastructure upgrades along its entire length. History The line opened as a cable tram line operated by the Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company on 30 August 1887, operating along Bourke and Nicholson Streets.Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company Limited Running Journal volume 9 no 3 page 16 It operated until 26 October 1940, when the Bourke Street cable lines were abandoned by the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) in favour of double decker buses. The Bourke Street cable lines were the last cable trams to operate in Melbourne. The MMTB, unhappy with the performance of the buses, decided to reinstate trams when the buses reached life expiry, trams on the 88 (predecessor to the modern 86) started on 26 June 1955 with the first tram to East Brunswick operating on 8 April 1956. The W7 class trams were built for running on these lines and the new Z class trams first ran on route 96 in June 1975.\\"New Cars for North Fitzroy\\" Trolley Wire issue 159 August 1975 page 40 The line was extended south to St Kilda along Spencer Street, the former St Kilda railway line, Fitzroy Street and The Esplanade to terminate in Acland Street on 20 November 1987 following the conversion of the St Kilda Railway (along with the Port Melbourne railway line) to light rail. The broad gauge track was re-gauged to standard gauge and the overhead voltage was reduced from 1500 V DC to 600 V DC with light rail platforms built adjacent to the former stations platforms. With the closure of North Fitzroy depot on 19 December 1993, its route 96 duties were transferred to South Melbourne depot. After the merger of the M>Tram network with Yarra Trams in 2004, most D2 class trams were transferred from Malvern depot to Southbank depot to help alleviate the congestion on the route.New low floor trams boost capacity on Route 96 Yarra Trams 26 July 2004 Since the introduction of these low floor Combino trams on the route, accessible stops have been built on Bourke Street, Fitzroy Street and St Kilda Esplanade, increasing customer safety and comfort. In response to frequent overcrowding on the tram system in 2008, the state government leased new C2 class trams from Mulhouse, France specifically to run the route.\\"Melbourne welcomes Mulhouse tram\\" Railway Gazette International March 2008 page 127 The first of these new trams began operation on 11 June 2008 with the nickname Bumble Bee 1. In November 2013, the first E class trams entered service on the route.Stand by your tram - Melbourne welcomes the E-class Yarra Trams 4 November 2013 In January 2016 of which there are now 26 which saw all D2 class trams transferred to Brunswick depot. Route 96 began operating through the night on Fridays and Saturdays as part of the Night Network.Night Tram Public Transport Victoria  Route 96 Project  On 17 April 2012, it was announced that Route 96 would become the focus of tram upgrades to transform it from a tramway to a light rail system; a \\"model\\" for how Melbourne's tram network should operate. The Route 96 Project superseded a similar project of the previous government, Tram 109. The proposed aims of the project are: *Providing level access stops along the entire route *Upgraded termini at Blyth Street, Brunswick East, and Acland Street, St KildaRoute 96 - Tram network upgrade - June 2015 Yarra TramsRoute 96: Acland Street, St Kilda Public Transport Victoria *Segregation treatments to better separate low-floor trams from traffic *Improved priority for low- floor trams at traffic lights *Improved customer information The objectives are to: *Increase access to trams and safety for customers through providing improved infrastructure and information *Improve tram reliability and efficiency through increased priority and accessible infrastructure *Ensure better utilisation of the road network with a focus on moving people *Design a full route of enhancements to demonstrate the benefits of a modern light rail system in Melbourne conditions, compared with a traditional tram network. In mid-2013, the proposed changes were released to the public. They involved an eventual segregation of trams from traffic along nearly the entire route, and the upgrade of all stops to level access to improve passenger flow and make the network disability-compliant. On Nicholson Street, all on-street parking would eventually be removed to create dedicated tram lanes where it is illegal for cars to drive. Easy-access stops (level access by raising the road to footpath level) would be constructed between Blyth Street and Brunswick Road, while centre island superstops would be constructed between Brunswick Road and the CBD. The Batman Park (previously the World Trade Centre) and Clarendon street junction (Previously Port Junction) stops in South Melbourne would be redesigned with a separate bay for the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant, while in St Kilda, some parts of Acland Street would be closed to cars in favour of widened footpaths, pedestrian plazas and tram right of way. The project has received strong support from commuters, urban planners and public transport advocates, while there have been concerns from shop owners along the route that a loss of on-street parking will negatively affect business. Work completed as at October 2018 has included: *new Blyth Street terminus headshunt at the northern end in July 2015Route 96 Improvements: Nicholson Street Public Transport Victora *new Clarendon Street Junction stop in January 2016Route 96: Stop 125 Port Junction Public Transport VictoriaPort Junction: Platform stop construction Yarra Trams *new Acland Street terminus in December 2016Acland Street upgrade Yarra TramsAcland Street upgrades City of Port Phillip *stop upgrades at Johnston Street, Moor street and Melbourne Museum in September 2018 along with stop removal at Hoddle St and Hanover street.

Critics were quick to dub the series \\"Middlesbrough's Burning\\" or \\"Teesside's Burning\\", after the popular fire-fighting drama that preceded it, London's Burning, yet there were very few similarities between the two, apart from them being about the business of firefighting.http://www.tv.com/shows/steel-river-blues/ Like its predecessor, Steel River Blues was an ensemble drama without any single starring part, though perhaps the best-known actor was Daniel Casey, who was previously a co-star in Midsomer Murders. Other stars included Joanne Farrell, Stuart Graham, Daniel Ainsleigh and Satnam Bhogal.http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/oldott/www.offthetelly.co.uk/index7d36.html?p=4338 The series title music was an original composition performed by Middlesbrough- born singer-songwriter Chris Rea. It was announced in January 2005 that the series would not be recommissioned due to low viewing figures.http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/itv-pulls-the-plug-on-steel-river- blues/1018518.article Subsequently, the series has never been released on DVD.
