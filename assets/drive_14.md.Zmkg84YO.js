Gifted by Riwai Keioni Te Ahu to Sir George Grey. Riwai Te Ahu (c1821-1866) was a notable New Zealand teacher and missionary. Of Māori descent, he identified with the Ngāti Hinerangi and Ngāti Awa iwi (tribe). He was born in Waitara, Taranaki, New Zealand. He was the son of Tuhoe of Waiongana and Waipuia of Waitara. In 1840 he was baptised by the Rev. Octavius Hadfield at the Waikanae Mission of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). From about 1840 to 1854 he was a catechist and teacher at the CMS mission at Waikanae. He worked with Hadfield to establish schools among the Māori people living in Queen Charlotte Sound, including at Okukari Bay. Early in 1855 Bishop George Selwyn took him to Auckland in order that he might study for the ministry at St. John’s College under the direction of Archdeacon Kissling. Te Ahu was ordained a deacon on 23 September 1855 at St Paul's Church, Auckland by Bishop George Selwyn. He was the second Māori clergyman appointed a deacon, following his friend Rota Waitoa who was ordained a deacon in 1853. In September 1855 he accompanied Bishop Selwyn and John Patteson on a pastoral visit to the South Island and the Chatham Islands. He was ordained a priest in 1858 and became a member of the CMS. On 11 July 1859 he was appointed as the assistant to the Rev. Hadfield at Ōtaki. In October 1859 he was a member of the first synod of the Diocese of Wellington. He managed schools in Queen Charlotte Sound and Tory Channel and was associated with the Anglican centre at Okukari Bay in Marlborough. He died at Ōtaki on 6 October 1866.

At the Restoration he was minister of Symington in the Presbytery of Biggar being admitted between 4 May and 2 November 1658. He was deprived by the Act of Parliament 11th June, and of Privy Council 1 October 1662. He became one of the most zealous of the Covenanting preachers; and for eight years peregrinated the country, conducting public worship on the hillsides and in private houses. Arrest Robert Inerarity Herdman Around the beginning of 1670, he was apprehended for preaching and baptizing in houses and sent to Edinburgh. He lay successively in the Canongate jail, in Stirling Castle, and Dumbarton Castle, till about the time of the granting of the second indulgence in September 1672, when he was liberated. By this indulgence, he was allowed to exercise his ministry within the parish of Cumbraes. But he declined to accept of this ensnaring boon, and associated with Mr John Welsh and others in preaching in the fields. Along with John Welsh and others, went about from place to place \\"holding conventicles, marrying, baptizing, and dispensing the Lord's Supper.\\" For nine years he assiduously carried on these earnest labours. In July 1674, he was publicly denounced a rebel and put to the horn. Hunter states that he fled to Holland although the source of this information is unclear. In August 1676, letters of intercommuning were issued against him. In 1681 he was captured and sent to the Edinburgh Tolbooth. On 15 February 1683 he was apprehended in Edinburgh, and on 15 September next year, the Council ordered him to be sent to the Bass Rock. He was sent at the same time as Sir Hugh Campbell but neither he nor Hugh's son Sir George Campbell was permitted to ride in a coach or on a horse someone provided.

Flagler County Commissioners were under pressure from local citizens and grand juries to repair the building or erect a new one. After months of negotiations, during 1938, between the Flagler County Board of Commissioners and the Works Progress Administration WPA an agreement to build a new Flagler County Jail building was approved. A WPA Project, No. 4242, was approved that cost approximately $24,000 (approximately $433,784 in 2019 dollars). It was agreed that the costs would be divided between Flagler County and the WPA. Construction of the new Flagler County Jail started January 25, 1939 under the management of Z. D. Holland, WPA Supervisor and well known local contractor. It was built on 2.04 acres of county-owned property located at 1600 Old Moody Blvd., Bunnell, FL.WPA to Work on Jail Project. Flagler Tribune, January 19, 1939. The construction project took a little over one year to complete as it was finished in early February 1940. The WPA, represented by Z. D. Holland, officially transferred sole responsibility of the finished building to the Flagler County government on February 2, 1940. Flagler County Commissioners promptly turned the keys to the building over to Flagler County Sheriff Ernest Walton “E.W.” Johnston who moved the county’s sheriff department into the new building and officially opened the jail.Completion of New Jail Here is Announced.

Architectural attributes Front East View of the WPA-Built Flagler County Jail (Photo taken January 2019). The WPA-Built Flagler County Jail’s architectural style was classified as WPA Rustic as it was built during the New Deal-era. This term is used by the National Park Service’s National Register of Historic Places program to classify many buildings and structures that were built by the WPA in the 1930s and early 1940s. It also has classic Masonry Vernacular architectural attributes which are mainly associated with public and commercial buildings that were built and designed by local builders who had no formal architectural education, and typically used traditional construction techniques and contemporary fashions. The function of the building is the dominant factor in this architectural style.Jaye, Randy. Flagler County, Florida: A Centennial History. Booklocker.com, 2017. The two story poured concrete building contained 6337 square feet. The first floor included an entrance lobby, heating and storage room, living quarters for the sheriff and a prisoner’s kitchen. The second floor included rooms for the guards and space to house 22 prisoners. It was alleged to be fireproof and said to be built like a tank by locals.Edmonson, Karen.

The building served as the Flagler County Jail from 1940 until the 1980s when a newer and larger building with 132 beds and a women’s wing was completed. During the 1940s into the 1960s, racial segregation mandated that the Flagler County Jail incarcerate white prisoners only (despite the fact that half of its construction funding came from federal dollars). During this period of racial segregation, black prisoners were incarcerated across the street in the older concrete block Flagler County Jail “Stockade” building. In 1965, an east wing was built for juvenile operations. In 1975, a west wing was built for additional administration operations.Jaye, Randy. WPA-Built Flagler County Jail. Flagler County Historical Society, 2019. Other building usages From 1995 through early 2019, the Church Women United have been using parts of the building as their food pantry and storage facility. The Flagler County Supervisor of Elections office was housed in the north addition from the mid-1990s to around 2005. The City of Bunnell Police Department occupied the building from 1987 to 2012. Also, Flagler County used the building for various storage items since the Flagler County Jail offices moved out in the 1980s.Simmons, Jonathan.

Historical significance The WPA-Built Flagler County Jail building was part of the group of Florida structures that were built for distinct public uses during the Great Depression (New Deal-era). These types of structures represent a small percentage of the buildings that were constructed during this period, but are important property types because they summarize the design creativity for specific usages for public facilities. The structures are also historically significant because they represent the first time that United States governmental agencies were linked to state and local agencies to provide mass employment that stimulated local economies and resulted in upgrading many facets of the national infrastructure. Florida’s New Deal heritage is characterized and lives within these structures. The WPA- Built Flagler County Jail was one of only three buildings constructed by the WPA in Flagler County. The other two are on the National Register of Historic Places: Bunnell Coquina City Hall and the Vocational Agriculture Building.London, Aaron.

He contested the 2016 and 2020 legislative elections as a member of the New Power Party, winning the latter election. Chiu served as leader of the New Power Party between March and August 2019, and was reappointed to the role in an acting capacity in August 2020. Early life Chiu was born on 29 April 1976, and was raised in Zhuqi, Chiayi County, near . His mother was a factory worker and his father was a teacher. He lived in Germany for five years, returning to Taiwan in 2010, upon completing a doctorate at Heidelberg University. He and his wife Huang Wan-ting moved to Huang's native Hsinchu, where the couple raised two children. Legal career After the death of Hung Chung-chiu, Hung's family hired Chiu as legal counsel. He remained the Hung family's legal representative until the conclusion of the case, an appeal heard in June 2017. During the Sunflower Student Movement, Chiu served as spokesman for a group of over three hundred lawyers that pledged legal aid to protesters. Chiu also represented Liu Yen-kuo in a murder case dating to 1997 until Liu's execution on 29 April 2014, Chiu's birthday. Chiu worked with fellow lawyer Tseng Wei- kai on the workers' compensation case. Chiu often offered legal commentary in his capacity as chairman of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights. In 2015, Chiu was present at an Anti-Black Box Curriculum Movement demonstration to offer legal assistance. The next year, Chiu represented music teacher Hsiao Hsiao-ling in a wrongful termination lawsuit. After Chiu contested the 2016 legislative elections as a New Power Party candidate, the party retained him for its legal team. Chiu has since taken on cases relating to public safety. Lawyers Chiu, Tseng, Liu Chi-wei, and Essen Lee were featured in a 2016 documentary directed by titled . In December 2017, Chiu published his first book in the Chinese language, Stand By You, about several of the legal cases he had worked up to that point in time. Political career Chiu joined the New Power Party (NPP) upon its founding in 2015. In February of that year, Chiu and Hu Po-yen became the first two people to represent the party as legislative candidates. Chiu faced incumbent lawmaker Lu Hsueh-chang in the Hsinchu district. The New Power Party attempted to ally itself with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but Chiu was critical of Ker Chien-ming, the DPP's candidate in Hsinchu, and refused to abandon his bid for office to support Ker's. Chiu's main point of contention with Ker centered on political transparency within the legislature. In October 2015, Chiu claimed that Ker had not responded to offers for the two candidates to debate each other before integration polling started. With no deal in place to conduct integration polling, Chiu formally registered his legislative candidacy by the November 2015 deadline. Chiu's campaign partnered with that of Hu Po-yen, Hung Tzu- yung, , and Freddy Lim, winning early support from Lin Yi-hsiung. Chiu's campaign team was led by Chen Wei-ting, a leader of the Sunflower Movement. Other Sunflower activists, such as Lin Fei-fan and Dennis Wei, also contributed to Chiu's campaign. During the campaign, Chiu spoke in support of legislative reform, and sharply criticized the scheduled Ma–Xi meeting. After Chiu Hsien-chih lost the election to Ker Chien-ming, he was named to a NPP task force on legislative reform. In April 2016, the New Power Party opened its inaugural local office in Hsinchu, and named Chiu its first director. In February 2019, Chiu contested an open seat on the New Power Party's executive committee and was subsequently elected party chairman, succeeding Huang Kuo- chang. Chiu resigned the party leadership on 12 August 2019, soon after Freddy Lim left the party, and Kawlo Iyun Pacidal's membership was suspended. Following the departure of Hung Tzu-yung from the party, the NPP continued attempts to convince Chiu to return as chair. Chiu refused to resume the chairmanship, and stated that either Hsu Yung-ming or Tseng Wei-kai should run for the position. In November 2019, Chiu accepted a nomination from the New Power Party to contest the 2020 election as an at-large legislative candidate. He was ranked second on the NPP party list. The New Power Party won over seven percent of the party list vote, allowing three at-large legislative candidates to take office. Within the Tenth Legislative Yuan, Chiu served as New Power Party caucus whip. On 1 August 2020, Chiu was named acting NPP chairman following Hsu Yung-ming's suspension from the post. Chiu and all members of the New Power Party's executive committee resigned their positions on 5 August, and the succeeding committee elected Kao Yu-ting to replace Chiu on 29 August.

Caller ID spoofing is used by robocallers to mask their identity or to make it appear the call is from a legitimate source, often a nearby phone number with the same area code and exchange, or from well-known agencies like the Internal Revenue Service or Ontario Provincial Police. This sort of spoofing is common for calls originating from voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems, which can be located anywhere in the world. STIR, short for Secure Telephony Identity Revisited, has been defined as a series of RFC standards documents by a Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. It works by adding a digital certificate to the Session Initiation Protocol information used to initiate and route calls in VoIP systems. The first public connection on the system, typically the VoIP service provider, examines the caller ID and compares it to a known list of IDs they provide to that customer. The provider then attaches an encrypted certificate to the SIP header with the service provider's identity and a trust value. VoIP software on the receiving end can check the authenticity of the message by decrypting STIR using the provider's public key. For non-VoIP systems, like cell phones and landlines, call routing information is carried by SS7. In these cases, the SIP header is not directly useful as it cannot be sent to users unless they are on a VoIP connection. This is the purpose of the SHAKEN system, short for Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs. SHAKEN is a suite of guidelines for public switched telephone networks that indicate how to deal with calls that have incorrect or missing STIR information. This may be in the form of additional information in the CNAM information of caller ID indicating the number has been spoofed, but the details have not been finalized. , SHAKEN/STIR is a major ongoing effort in the United States, which is suffering an \\"epidemic\\" of robocalls. Both the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and the Federal Communications Commission are requiring use of the protocols by June 30, 2021. The name was inspired by Ian Fleming's character James Bond, who famously prefers his martinis \\"shaken, not stirred.\\" STIR having existed already, the creators of SHAKEN \\"tortured the English language until [they] came up with an acronym.” Background =Caller ID= The idea of sending the phone number to the customer for identification purposes dates to 1968, when Ted Paraskevakos introduced the idea of modem-like devices that would send and receive the information over normal voice lines. It sent a small burst of information using the 1200 bit/s Bell 202 modulation in the time between the first and second rings. The concept was developed through the 1970s and had its first public trial with Bell Atlantic in 1984 and a follow-up in 1987. The system was widespread in the United States and Canada by the mid-1990s, and spread to most other countries by the end of the decade. It soon became an indispensable system allowing customers to screen calls from telemarketers. Marketers often provided alternative numbers in the caller ID so returned calls went to an inbound call center instead of the telemarketing firm where the call originated. Unscrupulous users began using this concept, which became known as \\"spoofing\\", to hide the true origins of the call to prevent callbacks. This became so common that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was given the mandate to sue companies that provided false caller ID information. =VoIP and SIP= The introduction of voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems allowed users to place calls to other users directly through the internet without ever using the public telephone network. Initially, these systems were proprietary, but over time a series of proposals created the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), a messaging protocol that contained the information needed to set up a VoIP call between two endpoints. SIP borrowed from existing protocols, including the use of simple headers like \\"From:\\" in a format similar to the SMTP email system. SIP requests are sent to proxy servers that provide access information for end-users to the caller, which is then used to provide a direct connection between the two endpoints. As the cost of an internet line with enough bandwidth to host a given number of simultaneous calls is much less than leasing that number of telephone lines, there was a strong economic benefit for companies to switch to VoIP as well. From the late 1990s a number of new PBX-like systems emerged that use SIP and VoIP to route calls wherever possible, only exiting to the plain old telephone service (POTS) system when required to call a non-VoIP user. A company with several of these systems in separate offices could forward the call to the one closest to the number being dialed, thereby reducing or eliminating long distance charges. As these systems became popular, new telephony providers emerged that offered centralized SIP routing, allowing both companies and end-users to use VoIP systems to call the service and then route back out to the POTS. Many of these also allowed incoming calls from conventional phone equipment, providing local or toll-free numbers for the inbound calls. This allowed users to place calls to and from anywhere with local access for a greatly reduced cost by avoiding the telephone company's own long-distance service. Today, a call may travel for most of its \\"distance\\" as a SIP-initiated VoIP call, only exiting to the SS7 POTS network at the final stages, if ever. As this sort of call became common, even the largest service providers, like AT&T;, began offering SIP/VoIP to their customers. In this case, the caller ID information is taken from the SIP headers, not the provider, and that information is often editable by the end-user. =ID spoofing= The opening of the telephone network to VoIP systems resulted in a dramatic lowering in cost for the support of multiple simultaneous phone calls. This was as much of a boon to robocallers as it was to legitimate users. By purchasing commodity personal computers and running suitable software, a robocaller can make hundreds of simultaneous calls for the cost of a single internet connection. In the early days of such robocalling, the caller would often attempt to hide their identity by entering false caller ID information into the VoIP software. This had the advantage of making it impossible for the called user to call back to complain, or even report the call to their provider or government agency like the Federal Trade Commission. Users quickly learned to stop taking calls from obviously faked IDs. In response, robocallers began using less obviously incorrect IDs, but these had a lower chance of being picked up - the chance to ignore a call from an unknown user was precisely why many used caller ID in the first place. Robocallers changed their tactics again, first by using phone numbers that were similar to the user's to make it appear local, and later by using well- known numbers, often government agencies, as part of scams. Using such tactics, robocalls become an increasing problem, rising another 18% year-over- year in 2019 with 26 billion calls between January and October, with an estimated 5.7 billion robocalls in the US placed in October 2019 alone. STIR The STIR system aims to add information to the SIP headers that allow the endpoints along the system to positively identify the origin of the data. This does not directly prevent the ability for a robocaller to spoof a caller ID, but it does allow upstream points to decide whether or not to trust that ID. For instance, a business system using a VoIP-based PBX might connect to the wider telephony network through a SIP service provider. When the SIP packet is received by these providers, they will add additional information to the header, indicating whether they are sure the call originates with a known customer and whether or not the caller ID they provided is one that is known to their system. In this example, the internal phone number may not be known by the provider, but they may agree that all numbers starting with 555-555 do indeed belong to that customer, and that the provided ID, 555-555-1234, is therefore valid. Likewise, a customer might use a separate toll-free number for return calls and thus have a legitimate reason to use a totally different caller ID number, perhaps 800-123-4567. There are three levels of verification, or \\"attestation\\", possible in the STIR protocol. The highest level, \\"Full Attestation\\", indicated in the STIR header with an \\"A\\", indicates that the provider recognizes the entire phone number as being registered with the originating subscriber. This would be the case for a landline or mobile phone where the customer connects directly to the VoIP network and the phone number can be verified as being a particular customer, or in the case of a company that has registered a particular callback number. \\"Partial Attestation\\", or \\"B\\", indicates that the call originated with a known customer but the entire number cannot be verified, which would be the case with a call originating from a client PBX where the extension number is not registered with the provider. \\"Gateway Attestation\\", \\"C\\", indicates the call can only be verified as coming from a known gateway, for instance, a connection to another service provider. STIR systems produce a JSON Web Token containing, among other things, the originating phone number as provided by the original SIP, the number being called, and the level of attestation being given by the provider. This information is then encrypted with the provider's private key, encoded using Base64, and appended to the original SIP header in a new Identity field. The new information now travels along with the original SIP request until it reaches its destination, another VoIP system or provider that will route the call to an external telephone. On reception, the STIR information is decoded using the provider's public key. If this fails, the STIR information can be considered invalid. If it properly decodes, it can extract the information and examine the attestation to decide whether to allow the call to continue. In the case of a VoIP endpoint on a smart phone, for instance, the display might show that the call is of an unknown origin (\\"C\\") or that it failed verification entirely. Anyone on the VoIP side of the call can add a STIR header claiming \\"A\\" attestation even to known-bad calls. This may start in a robocaller's software, for instance. In this case, upstream users would not have the keys necessary to decode the STIR header and the authentication would fail. The software might also encode a header to pose as a trusted source, but in this case, the known public key for trusted source would fail to decode the header and the authentication would fail. The STIR system relies on a chain of trust. For this to work, the system requires certification services that are well known so end user software knows whom to query to retrieve the public key, and are trusted to provide valid information and not provide keys to known-bad players. This network will be based on the existing Certificate Authority system in use today. The robocaller might find a VoIP provider willing to sign their calls even though they are known-bad, in the same fashion that there are internet service providers that provide service to known email spam farms . To combat this, the STIR header contains both the original phone number when it enters the provider as well as the caller ID being claimed. If these do not match, the STIR authentication fails. For such a certificate to get through, the provider would also have to be willing to fake the number on reception, for instance, by copying whatever caller ID number the robocaller provided. In this case the STIR will validate correctly, and stopping such calls will have to be done at a higher level, through key revocation or similar. The STIR system is defined as a series of Request for Comments documents by the IETF: * RFC 8224 - Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) * RFC 8225 - PASSporT: Personal Assertion Token * RFC 8226 - Secure Telephone Identity Credentials: Certificates * RFC 8588 - Personal Assertion Token (PaSSporT) Extension for Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN) SHAKEN STIR is based on SIP and is designed to work with calls being routed through a VoIP network. It does not work within the \\"original\\" telephony network, which relies on standards such as SS7 to route calls. VoIP calls enter the network at the \\"edge\\" through a variety of VoIP-to-telephony gateways, and they can receive STIR information at that point or anywhere earlier during the VoIP section of the call. But once inside the telephony network there is no standard for forwarding that STIR information to the end user. Additionally, STIR does not define how authentication failures should be handled within the network. In a system where most calls will not have STIR information, at least during the period where the system is being set up, failed STIR checks cannot simply block the call. Some sort of information has to be sent to the user, but the precise nature of that information is not part of STIR itself. To address these last-mile problems, the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) began work on an associated system known as SHAKEN. SHAKEN includes systems to pass STIR information through the SS7 network, a standard for the data to be added to SIP for calls originating in the SS7 network, how to send STIR information to POTS endpoints, and a set of guidelines on how to handle various STIR failures. In the common case of a robocaller calling an end user on a landline or mobile phone, it is the last step of the connection that does not directly handle STIR. For instance, if a call originates in a VoIP system and was tagged with a STIR header that successfully authenticated, the caller ID provided to the user might be appended with \\"(verified)\\", whereas one that fails might say \\"(spoofed)\\" or \\"(no verification)\\". , the exact nature of the messages sent to end users is still being discussed. The Secure Telephone Identity Governance Authority, or STI-GA, is organizing these discussions as well as calling for certificate authorities who will handle the majority of the key protocol. Additionally, the Secure Telephone Identity Policy Administrator, or STI-PA, has the job of actually carrying out policy decisions like key revocation. On May 30, 2019, the GA announced iconectiv had won the role of PA. Implementation STIR/SHAKEN was designed to allow expansion to carriers outside the US. On December 9, 2019, FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, and Ian Scott, chairman of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), conducted \\"the first official cross-border call\\" using the protocol. The same day, the CRTC announced that it \\"expects\\" all phone providers to adopt STIR/SHAKEN no later than September 30, 2020. Enforcement In December 2019, the TRACED Act (Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act) was signed into law, which compels the FCC to mandate implementation of the protocols by all U.S. phone companies. The FCC approved the mandate on March 31, 2020, under which large carriers must implement the systems by June 30, 2021, and smaller and rural carriers by June 30, 2022.

Much of Adams' work is centered around his Black identity, frequently referencing patterns, images, and themes of Black culture in America. Adams has additionally worked as a fine art professor, serving as a faculty member at Maryland Institute College of Art. Early life and education Derrick Adams was born in 1970 in Baltimore, Maryland. After a briefly teaching elementary school, Adams attended the Pratt Institute. Following his 1996 graduation, Adams earned his MFA from Columbia University, completing his degree in 2003. Career In 2016, Adams created an installation (titled Derrick Adams: THE HOLDOUT — A Social Sculpture with Curated Music Program) for the Aljira Center for Contemporary Art in Newark, NJ, that featured a large pyramid enclosing a broadcasting radio station. According to Adams, the pyramids in his work reference the long presence of Black culture and the cultural capital built by black people over history. Adams's 2016 show at Pioneer Works explored Black characters in popular culture. Titled Derrick Adams: ON, the exhibition included collages, sculptures, and lampshades that evoked characters from popular movies and TV shows like In Living Color and The Matrix. The Studio Museum in Harlem mounted Adams's 2017 exhibition Derrick Adams: Patrick Kelley, The Journey, in which the artist created mood boards for a proposed autobiography of the fashion designer Patrick Kelley, whose techniques with formal composition resonated with Adams in terms of the construction of identity. In 2017, Adams used the archival collections of the Stony Island Arts Bank (along with material from other collections), to create a solo show there, Future People. An installation environment featured a looping video that projected images and quotes from Black authors and speakers. A series of collages in the exhibition, Orbiting Us #1-#10, depicted items designed by Charles Harrison, the first Black executive at Sears, Roebuck and Company. Adams used the exhibition to highlight the productive power of Black people to imagine and innovate through difficult circumstances. At the Museum of Arts and Design in 2018, Adams showed work inspired by The Negro Motorist Green Book. Titled Sanctuary, Adams's show featured an installation environment structured by a miniaturized highway that ran through the galleries, passing collages that evoked locations listed in the guidebook. Sanctuary celebrated the leisure time and success of African Americans even during the Jim Crow era, partly illuminated by small houses resembling milk cartons. In 2018, the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver presented a survey of Adams's work spanning 2014-2017, including sculptures, installations, and works on paper. Titled, Derrick Adams: Transmission, the exhibition showcased three bodies of work: \\"Future People\\" (2017), \\"Fabrication Station\\" (2016), and a series of \\"Boxhead\\" sculptures (2014), exploring \\"Derrick Adams's ongoing study of racial identity as it is both filtered through popular culture and also reimagined for the future.\\" Derrick Adams was awarded a 2018 Gordon Parks Foundation Fellowship, and participated in a two-person exhibition, American Family: Derrick Adams and Deana Lawson, at the Foundation as part of the award. Adams says about the exhibition, \\"Parks' influence…goes beyond the visual, into the meaning and purpose of why I feel it's so important to show the many facets of black American life in ways that shed light onto the complexity and richness of our past, present and future.\\" In 2019, Adams's work was featured in the Fox TV hit Empire. The art work in the series depicts the main characters, Cookie and Lucious Lyon (played by Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard), and is part of a real-life limited-edition collection of objects, \\"Empire x Derrick Adams collection\\", which supports Turnaround Arts, an arts-based school program at the Kennedy Center. This wasn't the first time his work was showcased on a hit American TV show. In 2017, Issa Rae included his work in her HBO comedy Insecure. In 2020 Adams created a mural for Harlem Hospital.

Straka is well known as a painter that utilises a lot of detail. She often depicts cultures that are not her own which has caused controversy at times. Her work engages with themes of economic and social upheaval in interwar China, the role of women in Arabic society and Māori in relation to colonisation in New Zealand. Eventually the figure became important in Straka's practice and she began to use photographs as the starting point for some of her works and \\"Increasingly too the body feminine has become her milieu\\".  Education  During Secondary school Straka attended night classes studying art. Straka was accepted into Elam School of Fine Arts and she studied sculpture. She graduated with her BFA in 1994. Tutors of hers included Christine Hellyar and Greer Twiss. Once she had graduated she spent five years in France where she worked with the artist Julia Morison and learned about painting, subsequently switching to painting as her medium. After she returned to New Zealand in 2001, Straka completed her master's degree at the University Of Canterbury School Of Fine Arts.  Artworks and Major Exhibitions  In Straka's practice she works with contentious subject matter and questions tradition. Her series of paintings appropriating portraits of Māori chiefs by artists such as Charles Goldie, Gottfried Lindauer and colonial photographer, W.H.T. Partington were exhibited in an exhibition entitled Paradise Lost at the Jonathan Smart Gallery in 2005. Straka copied these paintings with her trade mark polished and detailed style but added new elements such as red tinged skin, tattoos, horns and halos. Depictions of Māori chiefs as Satan and as angels have recalled \\"the efforts of zealous missionaries who searched for godliness within Māori society.\\" Some of the portraits have a Sacred Heart placed on the chest of the figure. The fact that Straka did not receive permission from iwi to paint these images caused offense and outrage. In relation to these works Gina Irish has asked \\"Just who owns the image? Straka, Goldie, Lindauer or Partington? The sitter or the model's descendants? Iwi? How can the individuals depicted by these colonial masters and now Straka, ever be truly reclaimed?\\" In 2010 Straka exhibited her major project The Asian. For this project Straka commissioned artists in the Chinese painting village of Dafen to make 50 copies of her painting The Asian (2009). All 51 paintings were exhibited at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery with each painting have slight differences such as the hue and subtle additions of detail. The image mimics Chinese poster girls used in the 1920s and 1930s to sell products to the Chinese from the West. The project “as a whole questions notions of authenticity, originality and anonymity versus the individuality of the artist’s hand and eye.\\" In 2009 Straka exhibited her show Do Not Resuscitate at the Blue Oyster Art Project Space and again at the Jonathan Smart Gallery in 2010. In this exhibition, Straka developed large format photographs that reference the Japanese concept of the ero kawaii which Andrew Paul Wood has described as “that disturbingly pedophilic hybrid of Sanryo kitschy Hello Kitty cuteness and kinderwhore Lolita coquettishness”. The exhibition consisted of a wall of individual portraits of young female Japanese, Chinese and Korean models and a tableau vivant of the same girls gathered around a blond corpse on a gurney.

Derived from the Belgian Mauser Model 1889 and the Mauser 1898, it was used during World War II.  History and design  The Belgian Armed Forces had adopted the Mauser Model 1889, locally produced. After the First World War, the defeated Germany gave numbers of Mauser G.98 and Kar 98AZ to the kingdom. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Fabrique Nationale was manufacturing the FN Model 24 and Model 30, but lack of funding prevented the Army from buying these modern short rifles. In 1935, a new rifle was designed to replace all the rifles and carbines used in the different units. The Model 1935 combined elements of the Mauser 1889 (breach, magazine and stock) and of the Gewehr 98, but it was shorter. Some Model 35 rifles were modernised Mauser 98. Both the Manufacture d’Armes de L’Etat and the FN Herstal produced it between 1935 and 1940. A sniping version was also developed before the war. After the war, some Model 35 rifles were modified to fire in .30-06 Springfield, the cartridge of the American weapons used by the post-war Belgian Army. They were known as Model 35/46.  Service  The Belgian Army adopted it in 1935 but the Model 1935 never went into large scale production. It served during World War II alongside the Fusil Modèle 1936, a Model 1889 upgraded with some features of the Modèle 1935. Nazi Germany captured many rifles after the invasion of Belgium. The standard Fusil 35 was designated Gewehr 262(b) and the sniping rifle Zielfernrohrgewehr 264(b). These rifles were used by second-line German units. The Argentine government purchased a batch of slightly modified Model 35s to equip the Buenos Aires Provincial Police. Delivered in 1935-1936, they were kept in service into the 1960s.

Location The Official Camaligan River Park Marker The linear park is located along the riverside of the barangays of Sto. Domingo and San Jose-San Pablo in Camaligan. It is the most accessible river park outside the City of Naga. Creation The park is a joint project of Department of Tourism Region V and the Local Government Unit of Camaligan, Camarines Sur under the Bottom- Up Budgeting Program for the year 2015. In 2014, it was planned only to be the docking site of the Camaligan River Cruise or M/B Camaligan, thus, first naming the park as Camaligan River Cruise Park. Being located near the Bicol River, the people of Camaligan gained their socio-cultural identity as river people and traders during pre-colonialism. The idea of building the park was to promote the town's culture and bring life to the river as it is a reminder of Camaligan's significant contribution in the history and its integral role for the emergence of Bicol civilization.\\"Historic Camaligan\\". I Know Places. 30 March 2019. Retrieved June 16, 2019. Improvements As part of the Phase V, Camaligan Hanging Bridge is being constructed which will connect the park to the Sira and will finally connect the isolated barangays of San Francisco and Tarosanan to the town proper of Camaligan. Other Media Camaligan River Park was featured in iJuander, a magazine show in GMA News TV on September 20, 2017. It was again featured in TV Patrol Bicol, a regional TV show under ABS- CBN on February 7, 2019.

Biography  Frances—known as Fanny Mae to family and friends—was born in Anniston, Alabama, in 1891. She was the daughter of Harry Scheuing and Elizabeth Hocking; she had four brothers. The family eventually relocated to New York City, where Frances found employment as a journalist at The New York Telegraph. In 1913, she appeared as an Indian Maid in a photoplay called Picnic in Dakota. She recorded her appearance in her 1913 book, Motion Picture Acting. Francis Agnew in the 1913 photoplay \\"Picnic in Dakota\\" as the Indian Maid In 1920, she moved to Los Angeles to cover entertainment for the publication after her co-worker, Margaret Ellinger, quit to become a scenarist for actress Bessie Love. While on a European vacation in Rome, she caught up with the Ben Hur crew and was intrigued by the idea of writing movies. In 1924, she left the newspaper business behind (for a while, anyway) when she was hired on at Paramount's Betty Bronson unit to write scenarios. One of her first screenplays was the 1925 adaptation of Alice Duer Miller's Saturday Evening Post story \\"Are Parents People?\\" In 1926, she left Paramount to sign a contract with MGM. She also worked for First National and Fox for a time. In 1926, she was charged by Allan Dwan to do an uncredited re-titling and re- editing of his film Summer Bachelors, and at this time became more interested in the idea of editing. She continued writing and working on films through the end of the decade, working on scripts for films like The Joy Girl, Silk Legs, Syncopation, and The Rainbow Man. By 1932, she had returned to working as a newspaper columnist, writing about the state of the film industry for publications like The Los Angeles Times. She also wrote plays like Apples in Eden during the 1940s. During her later years, she was plagued by health troubles, including a broken hip sustained during a fall. She successfully sued her former physician and was awarded a hefty settlement after a jury agreed that her doctor's misdiagnosis had caused her permanent weakness in one of her legs. She died in Los Angeles on January 3, 1967. She had no children and never married.

In 996, he succeeded his first cousin Ibn Abī Zayd as leader (shaykh) of the school in Ḳayrawān (Kairouan). Al-Ḳābiṣī's father was born in the village of al-Maʿāfiriyyīn near Ḳabis (Gabès) and his mother was from Ḳayrawān. According to oral tradition, he was the first cousin of Ibn Abī Zayd and Muḥriz ibn Khalaf, the sons of his mother's sisters. He was blind. In Africa al-Ḳābiṣī was taught by Abu ʾl-ʿAbbās al-Ibyānī, a Shāfiʿī scholar from Tunis; Darrās al-Fāsī, an Ashʿarī; and Ibn Masrūr al-Dabbāgh. Accompanied by Darrās al-Fāsī and the Andalusian al-Aṣīlī, he went on a lengthy riḥla (journey) in the east from 963 until 968. During his journey, because he was blind, his companions acted as his secretaries. Before he took up jurisprudence, al-Ḳābiṣī taught ḳirāʾāt (recitation of the Ḳurʾān). As a jurist he was a traditionist with Ashʿarī leanings and partial to the writings of Ibn al-Mawwāz. He had deep knowledge of the ḥadīths. He helped spread the Ṣaḥīḥ of al-Bukhārī, a collection of ḥadīths, in northern Africa and wrote for it a riwāya, an account of its transmission. His other works include a collection of ḥadīths of the Muwaṭṭaʾ, popular in al-Andalus; a treatise on the conduct of schoolmasters, inspired by the writings of Saḥnūn; an incomplete collection of traditions of fiḳh; and numerous letters on everything from Ḳurʾānic exegesis, the architecture of ribāṭs, the rituals of the ḥajj, the theology of al-Ashʿarī and refuting the Bakrites (i.e., the Khārijites). Al-Ḳābiṣī's authority and reputation rose after the death of Ibn Abī Zayd (996) and Ibn Shiblūn (999) and he became the leading jurisconsult in northern Africa and al-Andalus. At the time of his death he was still teaching eighty students. His successors, who carried on his work, were Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān and Abū Imrān al-Fāsī. The culmination of the work of these Mālikī scholars of Ḳayrawān was the triumph of the Mālikī school in Africa west of Egypt and the breach between the Mālikī Zīrids and the Shīʿa Fāṭimids.

Jellison as a set of apartments in the Romanesque Revival style in 1904. Originally known as DuBois Flats and later as Belgravia Terraces, the building was a subject of litigation shortly before its scheduled opening in September 1904, and legal disputes over payment of construction costs delayed the opening until June 1906. History The Belgravia Building was constructed on the site of the Wallace House, built in the 1860s and reportedly Boise's first 2-story house, at the corner of 5th and Main Streets. The house had been intended for William H. Wallace, Idaho's first territorial governor, but he may not have lived there. Territorial Secretary Edward J. Curtis purchased the house, and after 30 years he deeded the property to Dr. George DuBois. Dr. Jesse K. DuBois, brother of Senator Fred T. DuBois, began construction in 1904 of the DuBois Flats, one of the first apartment buildings in Boise. Designed and built by John S. Jellison, the sandstone and brick building included 21 large apartments with exposure of 140 feet on Main Street and 110 feet on 5th Street. The building also featured Boise's first galvanized iron roof. As the building neared completion in September, 1904, Dr. DuBois became unable to pay his creditors, prompting lawsuits. The Idaho Statesman reported in November, 1905, that \\"litigation ensued over the failure to pay some of the bills in connection with the flats, and this, octopus-like, spread forth its tentacles until the ingenuity of almost every attorney at the Ada County bar had been drawn into the entangling meshes, as a representative of owner, contractor, laborer, material man, lien holder, mortgagee or other party in interest.\\" The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in the dispute, twice, and some creditors eventually received a portion of due payment. The Pacific States Building & Loan Association had issued a $30,000 mortgage in 1904 to finance the building, but litigation had prevented the loan company from acquiring the property in a foreclosure. In February, 1906, the company paid $28,050 at auction for the building. The new owners increased the rentable space to 30 apartments, and the building opened in 1906 under the name, Belgravia Terraces, perhaps an allusion to the prestigious Belgravia District in London. When the building opened, it had accrued total costs of $70,000, more than twice the original mortgage amount. In 1976 architectural historian Arthur A. Hart referred to the building as the Belgravia Apartments in his nomination form designating sites along Main and Idaho Streets as part of the Boise Historic District.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Penn Badgley's perversely endearing serial stalker keeps looking for love in all the wrong places during a second season that maintains the subversive tension while adding some welcome variations on the series' formula.\\" On Metacritic, the second season has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Alicia Lutes of IGN gave the second season, a 8.7/10, stating that \\"You goes the distance in its second season, giving us plenty of reasons to hang around Joe Goldberg’s toxic Nice Guy Serial Killer Shack a little longer\\" and adds that the \\"show's twists and turns take us places both expected and unexpected, putting a larger focus on the internal struggle of Joe's obsessive personality.\\" Robyn Bahr from The Hollywood Reporter mentioned in a glowing review of the second season, that \\"You remains as captivating as ever. Any other show would beg you to love its protagonist while revealing their childhood trauma. This one reminds you to keep your empathy under lock and key.\\" Sonia Saraiya from Vanity Fair recommended the second season in her review by highlighting that \\"You is committed to keeping the audience guessing, and as with the first season, much of the story is a chain of wild twists\\". Commending the show writers' approach in the second season, she adds that \\"You exhibits no sophomore slump\\". Tilly Pearce from Metro praised the second season, stating that it is \\"You Season 2 is more than enough to quench your thirst for twisted-in-a-sexy-way killers and keep you hooked for a serious binge session. The show doesn’t exactly change the wheel when it comes to the format, but ultimately there’s enough changes that you can get over it quickly. Penn Badgley is perfect in this role, as is Victoria Pedretti, and we can’t wait to see what season three (assuming it happens) brings.\\" Joshua Rivera of The Verge gave the second season a positive recommendation, writing that \\"At first, it seems like You is simply repeating itself, playing the same beats with a different woman in Joe’s sights...\\" but adds that due to \\"a combination of Badgley’s performance and the incredible savvy of every member of the crew that points a camera or light at him, you frequently suffer whiplash for liking him, as he goes from charming book nerd to sardonic lead to super creep in the same shot.\\" Clémence Michallon of The Independent gave the second season a very positive review, writing: \\"What follows is a dark psychological thriller that manages to be in every way as enthralling as its predecessor – a rare feat in a world where too many TV shows fail to quit while they’re ahead.\\" He said further, \\"Rivetingly told and well acted, YOU manages to make a viscerally unlikable protagonist endlessly interesting. That is no small achievement.\\" In a positive review of the second season, Angelica Jade Bastién from Vulture wrote that, \\"You proves itself to be a momentous, darkly spun treat this season that doles out blissful fun while providing fascinating commentary about the nature of desire, and it continues to be a great showcase for Badgley’s wiry menace.\\" Kimberly Ricci from Uproxx complimented the second season in her review, adding that it \\"begins as twisted comfort food for fans, but by midseason, it becomes clear that this is a whole new stalker ballgame.\\" She concluded with a positive recommendation, noting that \\"the season finale dangles a promise of even more madness to come.\\" LaToya Ferguson from IndieWire gave the series an \\"A-\\" grade, praising the second season for its \\"sly sense of humor\\" which she further adds \\"continues to make the series pretty funny\\".

Recently returned from a failed attempt to begin a journalism career in Russia, Sheron gathered a number of friends from past musical projects and set out to record a group of songs written abroad over the previous year. This project resulted in the recording of Balto's debut album, October's Road, which Sheron self-released in early 2011. Balto's early performances were largely confined to the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Brooklyn, and in the summer of 2011 the band embarked on its first national tour. Following the 2011 tour, Sheron relocated to Portland, Oregon and continued touring under the Balto name out of the Pacific Northwest. Over the next two years he slowly established a permanent lineup in Portland, consisting of Seth Mower (Drums), Luke Beckel (Guitar), Devon Hoffner (Bass), and Adam Finger (Keyboards). This group would go on to record Call It By Its Name, a 7\\" released in 2015, as well as an LP – Strangers – released in 2017. During this period, Sheron embarked on two solo tours in Russia.

Theatre Champs Elysees Congress of Allied Women on War Service (Congrès des Femmes alliées au service des œuvres de guerre) was a mass meeting of women on War Service. It was held in the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées of Paris, France in 22 August 1918. Two thousand Allied women engaged in War Service were in attendance. The Lyceum Club, on Rue de Penthièvre, branch of the London Lyceum, became headquarters of the Congress, and the environment suggested that an Inter-Allied Club for the Alliees might be the result of the movement. These women of the Allied nations, French, British, Serbian, Italian, and American, were looking far ahead. According to their program, they met “to improve the unparalleled opportunity of interpreting to one another the women of the nations in whose hands will rest in increasing measure the formative influences in the building of the new world. It is believed that such forces, rightly stimulated and directed will shorten the war.” Attendees The Congress was to have been presided over by Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister of France, and addressed by David Lloyd George, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; but, the events of war interfering, it was actually presided over by Lord Derby, British Ambassador to France, and addressed by Stephen Pichon, French Foreign Minister. Virginia Vanderbilt, chair of the Executive Committee The Executive Committee was chaired by Virginia Fair Vanderbilt and consisted of 26 members. The committee consisted of women from the three larger Allied countries, such as Julie Siegfried, Avril de Sainte-Croix, Mrs. Édouard de Billy, Comtesse d'Haussonville, Aline Poincaré Boutroux, the Marchioness of Hartington, Miss Ethel Knight, Comtesse Helene Goblet d'Alviella, Mildred Barnes Bliss, Edith Wharton, Isabel Stevens Lathrop, and Edith Roosevelt. Irene Headley Armes, Mary Dingman, and Mary George White were from the American Y. W. C. A. 200px The conference included 102 different women's societies for war service. There were women present officially representing the nations at war: British, French, American, as well as Belgian, Italian, Romanian, Polish, Serbian, and Montenegrin. Russia was represented as the women of the world did not bar their Russian counterparts from the association of the free. Others included women from the Republics of South America, Asia, and Africa. Women war workers from the American Y. W. C. A.,the American Red Cross, YMCA, and the American French Fund for Wounded, made up about three-fourths of the assembly according to the Paris Herald (now International Herald Tribune). Edith Balfour Lyttelton, representing the Women's Land Army, Dame Katherine Furze of the W. R. E. N., Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl of the British Red Cross, and Ray Strachey of the British Women's labor movement were part of the British delegation. The British Blue Triangle was represented by Alexandrina McArthur “Rena” Carswell Datta (1886–1978), the Marchioness of Hartington and Miss Ethel Knight. Janet Wallace Emrich The 75 American Y. W. C. A. secretaries in their blue gray uniforms were present to represent the women of the United States who sent them to France. Delegates from about one hundred other organizations were present. Janet Wallace Emrich, of Berkeley, California told of the spirit of cooperation shown by all the women in war work at the Congress, and of the gratitude that the French in particular felt toward the women of the U.S. Activities An elaborate ceremony occurred on August 21st at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. On August 22nd, as Lord Derby, British Ambassador to France, who presided, read the roll call of organizations, each delegation rose en masse. The two thousand women, led by an American colored regimental band rose and sang, in French and English, \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\". The war program of the French women was reviewed at the conference. A French woman, who wished that her country, her Government, might be wiser, said to the Executive Committee:— \\"If you can get the French Government back of this movement, you will have accomplished the liberation of the women of France; a new era will begin for them.\\" Émile Boutroux, one of the leading feminists of France, spoke about aligning French women with the women of the rest of the world. French women realized that day, perhaps for the first time, the power of women. Lyttelton stated that women may have done much, but they purpose to do more. She read a message from President Woodrow Wilson, and then outlined the great purpose of the women war workers, that of establishing a greater sympathy and an ever stronger union between all Allied women. Other activities included a dinner at the Hotel Quai d'Orsay, attended by five hundred Allied women. At the conclusion of the Congress, two thousand women scattered around Paris. Legacy It was agreed by the Executive Committee of the Congress of Allied Women on War Service that the following be sent to the women of the allied nations. The message was signed, on behalf of the Executive Committee, by Carswell. :The women on war service in France greet their coworkers in the allied countries. Our highest purpose must be— ::To stand united behind the armies. ::To render any service that will release a man for fighting the enemy. ::To fill any gap. ::To form a wall of endeavor as solid as that of our soldiers. ::To strengthen them as they protect us, and so to hasten victory and a lasting peace. :To the women who wait, we send a special greeting of respect. The courage with which they bear the heavy burden of their anxiety and the monotony of standing by, guides us on our way. Carry on, women on war service at home and abroad, all of us together; carry on! Archives Planning meetings occurred on August 3rd and 7th, 1918.

Both matches were played on the County Fairgrounds, and the first match was won by Carroll while the second was won by Waukesha. By some records, each of the days the matches were played were individual games, where the first team to score a goal won the game. By this metric, the team had an record of 8–7–0, although most record keeping sites declare the team having one win and one loss.

Endemic to Australia, it occurs on the New England Tableland of New South Wales and southern Queensland. It is species tolerant of poor drainage, frost and snow. Description Acacia granitica is a spreading or upright shrub high and wide, occasionally growing to tall in favourable conditions. Its branches grow horizontally from ground level and have a lined, roughish bark. Smaller branches are smooth and generally round. The phyllodes are more or less rigid, straight and narrowly elongated, long and wide. Each phyllode is smooth or has fine silky hairs with several obscure parallel veins and occasionally a more prominent midvein tapering to a stiff point. The phyllodes narrow to a short curved lined stalk. The inflorescence consists of 14-22 pale yellow to bright yellow flowers long and appear in pairs in the phyllode axis. The flower stalks are long covered in fine hairs. The seed pods are a dull mid-brown, narrow, either straight or with a definite curve and long and wide. They are also finely furrowed lengthwise, brittle and firm at maturity and either smooth or with several fine hairs at the apex. A species tolerant of snow and frost and wet situations, it flowers from late July to early October. Taxonomy and naming Acacia granitica was first formally described by Joseph Maiden in 1921 and the description was published in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. This wattle was initially named Acacia doratoxylon var. ovata in 1921 by Maiden and Ernst Betche from a specimen collected near Stanthorpe. In 1921, Joseph Maiden raised the variety to species status, giving it the name Acacia granitica because the name Acacia ovata was already in use for a different species. Maiden did not give a reason for the epithet (granitica) but wrote \\"apparently always on granite\\". Distribution and habitat This species mainly grows in north-eastern New South Wales near Bendemeer, Torrington and Guyra on granite outcrops in shallow sandy soil and also on sandstone in eucalypt forests, sometimes in heath or near creeks north of Grafton New South Wales to Crows Nest in Queensland. It tolerates poor drainage, frost and snow.

New York, No. 18–966, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with the 2020 United States Census. The case revolved around the decision of the United States Census Bureau under the Trump administration to include a question asking whether respondents are United States citizens or not on the standard census questionnaire sent to all households. Such a question had been purposely omitted from this \\"short form\\" since the 1950 Census as officials and sociologists widely fear it would reduce participation in the census. It has been used on the \\"long form\\" American Community Survey sent to a subset of households and used for statistical estimation. The Supreme Court case was a culmination of three separate cases decided between September 2018 and March 2019, with the earliest being heard under New York District Court Judge Jesse M. Furman. While the Census Bureau stated that the question was requested by the Justice Department to assist in enforcing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, lower courts have found that said explanation was pretextual. Additionally, many state and city officials have raised concerns that inclusion of the question would significantly depress response rates, which in turn would affect the quality of Census data, which is used, among other uses, to draw redistricting maps, which influence the results of future elections. Due to the urgency of printing the Census forms, the government expedited the case to the Supreme Court. On June 27, 2019, the Court decided that the Enumeration clause allows for a citizenship question to be added., 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019). However, it also stated that such additions can be reviewed by courts under the Administrative Procedure Act, and noted that the administration's explanation for adding the question \\"appears to have been contrived\\" and was pretextual. Unable to meet certain legal deadlines when the case was remanded to the District Court, the Trump administration announced it would issue an Executive Order to collect existing data from the Department of Commerce instead to tally immigration numbers. Furman issued a final order in July 2019 barring the administration from adding the question to the 2020 Census or delaying the Census any further. Background The United States Census Bureau, which operates out of the United States Department of Commerce, conducts a nationwide Census every decade to determine the population and its distribution within the United States, as required by Article I of the Constitution. The population numbers are used to distribute the number of members of the United States House of Representatives, as well as internally by each state to draw up their congressional and legislative redistricting maps. From the first Census in 1790 up through 1950, the Census is directed to be answered by all members of a household, regardless of their citizenship. The census thus included a question related to declaring one's citizenship. Starting in 1940, the Census Bureau began evaluating new methods of using reduced sample sizes to obtain additional information, and by the 1960 Census, had moved several questions to a separate \\"questionnaire form\\" that was only sent to a small sample of households as to reduce the burden of the main \\"long form\\". The citizenship question was one of those moved to the questionnaire form. Eventually the questionnaire form would evolve to the American Community Survey introduced in 2005. =2020 Census= Wilbur Ross, the United States Secretary of Commerce within the Trump administration following the 2016 presidential election, stated that the Bureau intended to add the question related to citizenship back to the \\"short form\\" sent to all households for the 2020 United States Census. Ross cited the need to add the question to prevent voter discrimination under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as determined by the Commerce Department, and he approved the addition of the question. Ross' decision was shortly met with criticism from state and local governments. These officials feared that the citizenship question would scare away up to 6.5 million people from completing the Census, particularly in geographic locations with large numbers of immigrants (legal or otherwise). Research suggests that the addition of a citizenship question to the census will likely lead to greater non-responses and incomplete responses from Hispanics and immigrants who fear the information from the census, which is intended to be kept private by the Census Bureau, may be used by law enforcement officials to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants and potentially even legal ones. Separate analyses, made from a combination of surveys and Census Bureau estimates over the past few years, show that the addition of the citizenship question is likely to lead to an undercount of approximately 5.8-5.9% of Hispanics and undocumented immigrants. An upper end estimate puts the undercount at 10% of households with undocumented immigrants. If the Census undercounted these areas, the states' representation in the federal government may be reduced, with upwards of eight states losing or gaining one or more seats by these analyses. The undercounting would further influence the required redistricting based on the Census prior in upcoming elections. This also would impact federal funding that is driven by Census data, estimated to be about for schools, infrastructure, and other services. =District Court proceedings= A lawsuit led by the state of New York's Barbara Underwood with the support of sixteen other states, fifteen cities, and other civil advocacy groups was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. During the discovery phase, it was discovered that Ross' reasons to add the question may not have come from the Justice Department but from discussions with Steve Bannon, President Trump's chief strategist during the first seven months of his presidency, along with Kris Kobach, a Kansas Republican known for strong anti-immigration views. The states argued that if this was the true basis for the question, rather than from a Commerce department decision, it would make the addition of the question unconstitutional. This led to Judge Jesse M. Furman of the district court to request the government set aside time for Ross for a deposition in September 2018, prior to the planned start of the trial in November 2018. The government opposed this action via a writ of mandamus to the United States Supreme Court, stating that requiring Ross to depose before the trial was not proper procedure, while also seeking to delay the trial. The Supreme Court refused to allow a delay, but did agree that Ross should not be deposed until after the trial's start. They also agreed to hear oral arguments related to early deposition, but not on the citizen question, with oral hearings for Department of Commerce v. U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Docket 18-557) planned on February 19, 2019. Judge Furman ruled on the citizenship question on January 15, 2019, finding that \\"the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census — even if it did not violate the Constitution itself — was unlawful for a multitude of independent reasons and must be set aside.\\" Furman vacated Ross's decision and enjoined the Census Bureau from adding a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. A few days later, the Supreme Court stated they would no longer hear the oral arguments related to the deposition issue, but did not rule out reviewing the case at a later time. Supreme Court On January 25, 2019, the government petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari before judgment, bypassing the normal appeal process through the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, as the deadline for printing the 2020 census forms was by June 2019, the end of the Supreme Court's own term. The government asked two questions in its petition, the first again asking about the deposition of a government official before the start of a trial, and the second to review Judge Furman's decision. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 15, 2019, fast-tracking it to hold oral arguments in April 2019 allowing them to rule on the matters before the end of term. February 22, 2019, the court set the case for oral argument April 23, 2019 at 10 a.m. Concurrent to New York's challenge, a separate case related to the census question was brought by the state of California and several local and city governments against Ross and the Commerce Department, challenging the question's addition as a violation of the Enumeration Clause of Article I of the Constitution. The case was heard by Judge Richard Seeborg at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In early March 2019, Seeborg ruled in favor of the state and local governments, agreeing that the question's addition would be unconstitutional. On March 15, 2019, the Supreme Court ordered both sides in the New York case to prepare to discuss the potential constitutionality of the question in light of Seeborg's decision. Yet another separate case related to the Census citizenship question was decided by Judge George J. Hazel in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland a few weeks before the Supreme Court's oral hearings. Hazel also found cause for the citizenship question to be unconstitutional given the current political climate about immigration, and questions the process that was claimed for how Ross came to add the question. However, this decision will not be considered by the Supreme Court due to its lateness in the process. =Oral argument= Audio of oral argument During oral arguments, observers to the court felt that the decision would fall along ideological lines favoring retaining the citizenship question. While the court's more liberal justices followed Justice Sonia Sotomayor in fearing the question would cut down on responses and thus impact the final numbers, the conservative members including Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh felt the question asked was fair, had been on the questionnaire for the majority of the Census' history, and was similar to questions asked by other countries during their census-taking. The conservative Justices also believed that laws relating to the content of the Census were deferent to the decisions made by the Secretary of Commerce, so Ross was in his right to add the question regardless of its origins. = Hofeller documents = In late May 2019, following oral arguments but before the Court gave its decisions, the New York Times published documents recovered from a hard drive owned by Thomas B. Hofeller, a political strategist for the Republican party who died in August 2018. The documents indicated that Hofeller may have had a significant role in framing the need for the citizenship question, driven by the current Republican goal of partisan gerrymandering to assure long-term control of Congress and state legislative bodies. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in light of this evidence, asserting that assistants to Ross obfuscated Hofeller's role in how the question became framed. At the time of this case, the Supreme Court had dealt with the question of partisan gerrymandering in the previous and current term. Alongside this action, the New York Immigration Coalition sought injunctions in Furman's District Court over these findings within the week of their discovery; Furman delayed his decision pending the ruling made by the Supreme Court. = Decision = The Court issued its decision on June 27, 2019, affirming and reversing the District Court's decision in parts. The majority decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts, with the other justices split among concurring and dissenting in part. The majority decision upheld that the Enumeration Clause allows for a citizenship question to be added to the Census but stated that the decision to add this question is a reviewable action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Supreme Court also agreed that the explanation provided by the Commerce Department for the question was insufficient. Roberts wrote that under the APA, they were expecting that Commerce would \\"offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public\\", and that the reason provided by Commerce \\"appears to have been contrived\\" and was pretextual. Roberts was joined by the four liberal Justices, Ginsburg, Kagan, Breyer, and Sotomayor, in affirming the District Court's injunction on adding the question until Commerce is able to provide a satisfactory explanation. Subsequent actions The decision left the matter of whether the citizenship question would be included on the 2020 census unresolved. Whether it would ultimately be included depended on if the Department of Commerce could present a \\"non-pretextual\\" rationale for the question's inclusion to the District Court before the printing deadline. On July 2, 2019, the Trump administration stated that it will go ahead and print the census forms without the citizenship question. However, the next day, President Trump countered this, stating that the administration was still exploring options to include the question, which was later confirmed by the Justice Department. Under demand of Judge Hazel from the Maryland District Court, the Department affirmed July 5 that it still intended to add the question, requesting Judges Hazel and Furman to begin scheduling of discovery hearings to the two District cases, with Hazel refusing to delay this phase further at the Department's request. On July 7 the DOJ announced that it was replacing its entire legal team dealing with that question, but on July 9 Furman rejected the DOJ action, saying that reasons must be given for the withdrawal of each attorney, and pointing out that the administration had been insisting for months that the question needed to be settled by July 1. On failure to replace the legal team, Trump announced on July 11, 2019 he had instructed the DOJ to no longer seek action on the census question, and instead issued Executive Order 13880 to request that the Department of Commerce provide the administration with all the data it had on citizenship and immigration status. Furman issued his order on July 16, 2019 that permanently barred the government from including the immigration question on the 2020 Census or to further delay preparations for the Census. Further, Furman's order stated the court would retain jurisdiction on the matter until the conclusion of the census, on December 31, 2020 when the results are to be delivered to the President. Plaintiffs in the District Court case continued to seek motions for sanctions on the Trump administration for providing false or misleading statements during the case. Their claims were further backed by emails and additional evidence released in November 2019 by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, who had concurrently been investigating the census question's addition since 2018. The new emails showed stronger evidence that Hofeller had worked closely with Mark Neuman, the administration's former adviser on the Census, for the immigration questions than previously established.

Educated in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, Šliūpas began a private medical practice in Ariogala. At the same time, he actively supported Lithuanian book smugglers and was arrested by the Tsarist police in 1900 and exiled to Kazan. As a doctor, he was mobilized by the Imperial Russian Army during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905 and World War I in 1914–1918. In Lithuania, he was an active participant in the Lithuanian National Revival, organizing various societies including the cultural Daina Society (which he chaired in 1904–1906) and the educational Saulė Society. He became the first chairman of the Lithuanian Red Cross and worked to establish three hospitals in 1919, organize health care for prisoners of war and war refugees in the difficult and chaotic post-war years. Šliūpas worked to establish Birštonas as a spa town, build a new hospital in Klaipėda (opened in 1933) and a tuberculosis sanatorium in Panemunė (opened in 1932). In 1932, he resigned as chairman of the Lithuanian Red Cross due to disagreements with the authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona and devoted his time to his private medical practice. Early life and education Šliūpas was born in a well-off family in near Gruzdžiai, then part of the Russian Empire, on 2 June 1865. According to the memoirs of his brother, a noted Lithuania activist Jonas Šliūpas, the family told stories about their wealthy ancestors who traced back to the time of Grand Duke Vytautas (died in 1430). His uncle Aloyzas attended Kražiai College and later became a priest. With his uncle's help, Šliūpas received basic education and got admitted to the Mitau Gymnasium (present-day Latvia) in 1874. At the gymnasium, Šliūpas became interested in Lithuanian language and culture and, when his brother Jonas became editor of Aušra newspaper, helped distribute the illegal Lithuanian press. In 1884, Šliūpas graduated from the gymnasium and began biology studies at the Saint Petersburg University. There he continued to work for the Lithuanian causes, handwriting Lithuanian-language newsletter Žinių nešėjas (Carrier of News). He worked with Vincas Kudirka on establishing Varpas, a Lithuanian-language newspaper. Šliūpas helped raise funds and visited publisher Martynas Jankus in East Prussia. After the graduation in 1889, Šliūpas decided to study medicine at the University of Moscow. There, he was roommate and close friends with Kazys Grinius, future President of Lithuania. Šliūpas graduated with a medical degree in 1894. Doctor and activist In 1891–1893, he helped combat a cholera outbreak as a result of the Russian famine of 1891–1892. After the graduation, he briefly worked at the clinics of the University of Königsberg before taking up a private practice in Ariogala. He actively supported Lithuanian book smugglers who transported and distributed the banned Lithuanian publications. He was implicated in the large case against Lithuanian activists and book smugglers in 1900 (known as Liudas Vaineikis case) and was sentenced to two years of exile in February 1902. He was exiled to Kazan. He briefly returned to Lithuania in 1904 but was mobilized to serve as a medic in the Russo-Japanese War, including in the Battle of Mukden. He returned to Lithuania and settled in Garliava where he lived until his death. The Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904 and Lithuanians were allowed to organize their own cultural societies. Šliūpas became an active organizer. He helped organize and in 1904–1906 chaired the Daina Society which organized concerts and theater performances. He also helped organize the Saulė Society which established Lithuanian-language schools and the Lithuanian Scientific Society which promoted scholarly research, and supported Ateitis and Pavasaris magazines for Catholic youth. In 1910, together with Saliamonas Banaitis and others he organized the consumers' co-operative Nemunas and was its chairman in 1910–1914. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was mobilized again. He directed a mobile lazaretto organized by the Kaunas Red Cross Hospital, but as a politically unreliable activist he was reassigned to interior of Russia. He returned to Lithuania in 1918 becoming teacher of hygiene at the Kaunas Priest Seminary and a deputy of the Council of Lithuania organizing local administration in Kaunas area. He was also a board member of a trade union of electrification companies. In 1922, he became chairman of the state examination commission of physicians. Unlike many other activists of the time, Šliūpas was not keen on writing and contributed only a couple articles to the Lithuanian press. Red Cross In January 1919, Šliūpas and others founded the Lithuanian Red Cross Society. He became the first chairman of the society and worked to reopen and restore the Kaunas Red Cross Hospital, establish another hospital in Kaunas for infectious diseases, and open a new hospital in Panevėžys. During 1919, the three hospitals treated some 4,000 patients. The Red Cross Society organized chapters in cities and towns across Lithuania, established training courses for nurses and midwives, helped negotiate prisoner of war exchanges, arranged health checks for war refugees returning to Lithuania, provided humanitarian aid to Lithuanian prisoners and deportees in Russia, treated wounded soldiers of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. The Lithuanian Red Cross became a recognized member of the International Committee of the Red Cross in August 1923. In 1924, the society started publishing Žiburėlis magazine for children which was edited by Šliūpas and others. Šliūpas worked to establish Birštonas as a spa town, build a new hospital in Klaipėda (opened in 1933) and a tuberculosis sanatorium in Panemunė (opened in 1932). In 1932, Šliūpas resigned as chairman of the Lithuanian Red Cross due to disagreements with the authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona. In April 1932, President Smetona adopted a law regulating the Lithuanian Red Cross – it became accountable to the Ministry of the Interior and was assigned a special government inspector who had broad powers to interfere in the society's activities. Later life After the resignation from the Lithuanian Red Cross, Šliūpas lived in Garliava (he moved to nearby in 1939) and had a private medical practice. After World War II, his three daughters retreated ahead of the advancing Red Army and eventually settled in the United States. While his son Mindaugas Šliūpas, member of the Lithuania men's national basketball team, was arrested and deported to Siberia in 1945, he managed to avoid Soviet repressions and worked as a director of the Garliava ambulatory in 1945–1949 and as vaccine administrator in 1949–1951. He died in 1959 at the age of 93. He was awarded Red Cross medals by Germany, Latvia, Estonia. In 1999, the Lithuanian Red Cross established the Rokas Šliūpas Award. In 2012, the Garliava polyclinic was renamed in honor of Rokas Šliūpas.

The show was held in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico, which is IWRG's primary venue. As the name indicates the event commemorates the anniversary of IWRG, which was founded on January 1, 1996. All matches on the show were held inside a steel cage match, for some matches combining that stipulation with a second stipulation as well. In the main event Máscara Año 2000 Jr. defeated Toscano in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", and as a result Toscano was shaved bald. Also on the show Los Oficiales (Oficial 911 and Oficial AK-47) won the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship from Capo del Norte and Capo del Sur in a three-way match where Heddi Karaoui and Zumbi managed to retain their TWS Tag Team Championship. Dragon Bane successfully defended the IWRG Reyes del Aire championship against Rey Horus and in the opener Atomic Star defeated Güero in a \\"Battle of the Schools\\" battle royal, which meant Güero had all his hair shaved off. Production =Background= Wrestler-turned-promoter Adolfo \\"Pirata\\" Moreno began promoting wrestling shows in his native Naucalpan de Juárez, Mexico, bringing in wrestlers from Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) to Naucalpan as well as featuring wrestlers from the Mexican independent circuit. Later on he would promote shows mainly in \\"Arena KO Al Gusto\\" and served as the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) partner, using the name Promociones Moreno as the business name for his promotional efforts. In 1977 Moreno bought the rundown Arena KO Al Gusto and had Arena Naucalpan built in its place, an arena designed specifically for wrestling shows, with a maximum capacity of 2,400 spectators for the shows. Arena Naucalpan became the permanent home for Promociones Moreno, with very few shows held elsewhere. In late 1995 Adolfo Moreno decided to create his own promotion, creating a regular roster instead of relying totally on wrestlers from other promotions, creating the International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) on January 1, 1996. From that point on Arena Naucalpan became the main venue for IWRG, hosting the majority of their weekly shows and all of their major shows as well. The first IWRG Anniversary Show was held on January 1, 1997 with all subsequent shows being held on or right after January 1 each year, all at Arena Naucalpan. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. For this special event every single match too place inside a steel cage that was erected around the ring, a concept that IWRG also used for their 22nd Anniversary Show that also featured 5 steel cage matches combined with other stipulations.

The season was inspired and adapted elements from the comic book storylines of Batman: No Man's Land and Batman: Zero Year. The subtitle for the season is Legend of the Dark Knight. The season was ordered in May 2018. Production began that July and ended that December. Ben McKenzie stars as Gordon, alongside returning principal cast members Donal Logue, David Mazouz, Morena Baccarin, Sean Pertwee, Robin Lord Taylor, Erin Richards, Camren Bicondova, Cory Michael Smith, Jessica Lucas and Chris Chalk. The fifth season premiered on January 3, 2019 on Fox and concluded on April 25, 2019, consisting of 12 episodes.

While the season was initially given a 10-episode order, this was later increased to 12, thereby making the season finale the series' 100th episode. John Stephens serves as the season's showrunner. =Writing= The fifth season is shorter than the previous seasons, all of which had 22 episodes each. As a result of this, Stephens said, \\"We move really quickly [...] We tried to build out the character moments as well. Sometimes we've had so much plot that we had to squeeze out some of the character stuff and now that it's the last chance we have to be with these characters, we're letting them live in these moments.\\" The season is inspired by, and adapts elements from two comic book storylines: Batman: No Man's Land, in which the beleaguered Gotham City is cut off from the rest of the world; and Batman: Zero Year, which focuses on Bruce Wayne / Batman's initial period as a costumed vigilante, and his efforts to stop Edward Nygma / Riddler from taking over Gotham. The No Man's Land arc was planned three years in advance, and the producers intended for it to be an \\"inspiration\\", rather than a \\"religious\\" adaptation of the comic book storyline. The season features ellipsis and analepsis, and therefore three time periods: the season premiere opens 391 days after the events of the season four finale \\"No Man's Land\\", before settling back at 87 days. The final episode jumps 10 years into the future, where Bruce is established as a vigilante. =Casting= Main cast members Ben McKenzie, Donal Logue, David Mazouz, Morena Baccarin, Sean Pertwee, Robin Lord Taylor, Erin Richards, Camren Bicondova, Cory Michael Smith, Jessica Lucas and Chris Chalk return from previous seasons as James Gordon, Harvey Bullock, Bruce Wayne, Leslie Thompkins, Alfred Pennyworth, Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin, Barbara Kean, Selina Kyle, Edward Nygma / Riddler, Tabitha Galavan, and Lucius Fox. Despite Lucas initially being advertised as a regular for the season, her character was killed off in the season premiere. For the final episode, Lili Simmons replaced Bicondova to portray Selina as an adult. Benedict Samuel, who played Jervis Tetch / Mad Hatter as a regular in the third season and a guest in the fourth season, returned as a guest in the fifth season. Andrew Sellon, who recurred as Arthur Penn in the fourth season, returned for the fifth season in a guest capacity. He said his character would have become the series' version of the Ventriloquist, but due to the shortened season and pacing reasons, the idea was initially scrapped. After Fox extended the season's episode count from 10 to 12, the creative team were able to continue with their original plan of making Penn the Ventriloquist. Shane West played the recurring role of Gordon's military ally Eduardo Dorrance, written as the series' version of Bane. In October 2018, Jaime Murray was cast in a recurring role as Theresa Walker; it was eventually revealed that her character was actually Nyssa al Ghul. =Design= John Glaser designed the season's costumes. Stephens compared the Batsuit worn by Bruce Wayne in the season finale to the one seen in the film The Dark Knight Rises (2012) due to being a matte, metallic short-eared battlesuit. Mazouz provided the close up shots and voice for the character, while stunt double Mikhail Mudrik filled in for distant shots to fit with the character's grown-up appearance. Lord Taylor said the season finale would feature Oswald Cobblepot resembling the character as he in the comics. To achieve Cobblepot's fat look, he wore a fatsuit. At Lord Taylor's request, the costume designer consciously avoided making Cobblepot resemble Violet Beauregarde's \\"blueberry girl\\" look from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) and instead went for a \\"little more monstrous\\" look, which included depicting the character with a hunch. Additionally, Edward Nygma's season finale Riddler costume was designed to look exactly as in the comics, by having a green color scheme and being filled with question marks throughout. The final episode sees Selina established as a cat burglar; Bicondova said the costume for this episode eschewed the ears seen in most Catwoman costumes in order to look more grounded. =Filming= The season began production in July 2018. Before the season began filming, Ben McKenzie began growing a moustache to accurately resemble Gordon as seen in the comics. However, since he had only two days to grow the moustache, it was ultimately decided that he sport a fake one. Erin Richards directed \\"The Trial of Jim Gordon\\", which was the season's twelfth and final episode to be produced but ninth to air, making her directorial debut on television. Filming for the season ended in December. Release The season premiered on January 3, 2019 on Fox in the United States, and ended on April 25, 2019. The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 11, 2019. Reception =Ratings= =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 85% approval rating with an average rating of 7.17/10 based on 20 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Gotham concludes in a glorious free- for-all that takes full advantage of the series' dense roster of colorful villains, making for an extended climax that is equal parts daffy and thrilling.\\" References Gotham (TV series) seasons 2019 American television seasons ","title":"Gotham (season 5)"},{"id":"59979885","text":"Luzhma () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Fedovskoye Rural Settlement of Plesetsky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia.

The leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide, dull at first before becoming glossy and dark green. The flowers are borne in groups of between 9 and 27 on an angular peduncle long, each flower on a pedicel up to long. The flower buds are greenish, wide with a smooth, conical operculum as long as, or up to 50% longer than the floral cup. The stamens are white. The fruits are woody, conical to hemispherical capsules long and wide. Taxonomy and naming This eucalypt was first formally described in 1993 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper who gave it the name Eucalyptus decipiens subsp. adesmophloia and published the description in the journal Nuytsia. In 2012, Dean Nicolle and Malcolm French raised it to species status as Eucalyptus adesmophloia. According to Brooker and Hopper, the specific epithet (adesmophloia) is derived from the Greek adesmos meaning \\"unfettered\\" and phloia meaning \\"bark\\", referring to the bark of this species. In ancient Greek, \\"bark\\" is phloios (φλοιός).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus adesmophloia grows in mallee shrubland between the Stirling Range, Bremer Bay, Manypeaks and the Fitzgerald River National Park where it is common. Conservation This eucalypt has been classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Arman died on February 2, 2019 after he and his sister, Wranga Loni, participated at a protest sit-in outside Loralai's Press Club. The four-day sit-in had been held by PTM activists to protest against the 2019 Loralai attack, in which eight policemen and a civilian had been killed by gunmen and suicide bombers affiliated with the Taliban on January 29. His family and PTM activists claimed that he was beaten by the police after the sit-in, after which a police officer struck him on the neck with a gun, causing him to collapse and die on his way to hospital. However, the medical superintendent of Quetta’s Civil Sandeman hospital, Saleem Abro, rejected the family's claim and said that the postmortem reports indicated no torture marks on his body. The police similarly claimed that the death was caused by a heart attack. On the other hand, in a parliamentary panel, the Pakistani senators Farhatullah Babar and Muhammad Ali Saif supported the allegations made by Arman's family and said that according to their information, the postmortem noted some critical marks in his brain, indicating that the head injury had caused some blood clots in the brain which led to his death. Mohsin Dawar, a Pakistani parliamentarian and PTM leader, said that an application to lodge a first information report (FIR) for the murder was submitted against the prime suspect assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Attaur Rehman Tareen. The police, however, refused to lodge an FIR, which was criticized by Shireen Mazari, the Human Rights Minister of Pakistan. On February 3, the Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan took notice of Arman's death and sought an official report from the commissioner of Zhob Division within 48 hours. On February 4, the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party and other allied political parties observed a 'shutter down' strike throughout the Pashtun part of Balochistan in protest against the murder. PTM held widespread protests in reaction to the murder, during which more than 20 of its activists, including Gulalai Ismail and Abdullah Nangyal, were arrested by Pakistani authorities. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called on Pakistani officials to transparently investigate the death, with the former also calling on the authorities to immediately release the PTM activists arrested for protesting against the murder. Arman was survived by his wife and three children. Early life and education The eldest of three siblings, Arman belonged to a modest family from Sanjawi in the Ziarat District of Balochistan, Pakistan. He belonged to the Loni Durrani tribe of the Pashtuns. His father was a driver. Arman received his early education in Sanjawi and completed his master's degree in Pashto at the University of Balochistan, Quetta. While pursuing his education, Arman started working seasonally at coal mines and part-time as a tailor to support himself financially. Despite the economic hardships, Arman started taking part in political activities of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party and became a human rights activist during his student life. Later on, Arman also pursued his Master of Philosophy degree. He wrote a thesis on \\"using metaphors in Pashto folklore literature against colonial enemies\\", a topic which mirrored his political thoughts. Career and political activism After his master's degree, Arman successfully passed the Balochistan Public Service Commission test in 2012 and became a lecturer of Pashto literature at Degree College Quetta. He was the founder of \\"Pashtun Progressive Writers\\" (, Paṣhtānə Mutaraqī Līkwāl), an organization aimed at nurturing the new generation of Pashtun authors. Already a political activist of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, Arman joined the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (\\"Pashtun Protection Movement\\") in February 2018, along with his young sister Wranga. Both of them actively took part in organizing the PTM public gatherings, usually traveling to the gathering site a week earlier to help run awareness campaigns among the locals. At the gatherings, Wranga would mostly give speeches from the stage but Arman would usually prefer to be behind the scenes. His family was threatened by Pakistani law enforcement agencies and pro-government tribal leaders (masharān) for their activities in the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement. The Loni tribal chief warned Arman to stop his activities and told him that the agencies would not tolerate it. Consequently, Arman's family was forced to move from Sanjawi to Killa Saifullah, the hometown of Nawab Ayaz Jogezai, the Pashtun tribal chief who offered them refuge. Arman then transferred himself from Degree College Quetta to Degree College Killa Saifullah to live with his family. Death At the time of the death, the four-day sit-in in Loralai held by PTM activists to protest against the 2019 Loralai attack had ended temporarily, and after negotiating with the government the participants were peacefully dispersing. According to Arman's sister, Wranga Loni: “Arman was participating in the Loralai sit-in and left after talks with the government. But the police then attacked the protesters. One of the policemen hit Arman on his head, due to which he died on the spot.” Arman's family also blamed the police for barring him from reaching hospital on time. Some police officers, however, alleged that Arman was not beaten and claimed that he died of a heart attack. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called on Pakistani officials to transparently investigate the death. On March 5, 2019, the standing committee on human rights in the Senate of Pakistan condemned the police for refusing to lodge a first information report (FIR) for Arman's death. The committee ordered the police to lodge an FIR and launch an inquiry against the accused police officers. =Funeral prayers= Late on February 3, the Islamic funeral prayer for Arman was performed in Killa Saifullah. PTM leaders Manzoor Pashteen, Ali Wazir, and Mohsin Dawar were banned by the Pakistani government from entering Balochistan for Arman's funeral prayer, but they still succeeded in travelling to Killa Saifullah and participated in the funeral prayer. However, they were ordered by the government to leave Balochistan within the night. This move was condemned by the Pakistan Peoples Party senator Farhatullah Babar. Pashteen alleged that on their way back, a security escort opened fire on the car transporting himself, Ali Wazir, and Mohsin Dawar, but they were unharmed. The firing incident was condemned by the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party senator Usman Kakar and the human rights minister Shireen Mazari. During the burial ceremony in Killa Saifullah, Manzoor Pashteen, Wranga Loni, and Nawab Ayaz Jogezai made speeches to the public. Pashteen said: “They killed our youth, beheaded our elders, destroyed our homes, dishonored our mothers and sisters. They still chase our youth. It reached a point where they even prevent us from attending our funerals. In such circumstances, when you block all our options and ways for negotiations, we will forcibly find a way. Then we will show you the power of Pashtuns.” Absentee funeral prayers were performed for Arman in many cities and towns of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other countries, including Jalalabad, Asadabad, Khost, Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, and Karachi on February 3, Kabul, Kandahar, Gardez, Sharana, Puli Alam, and Zhob on February 4, Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Ghazni, Qalati Ghilji, Bannu, and Barikot (Swat) on February 5, and Kunduz on February 7. In Bamyan, a protest gathering for Arman was held on February 14 in front of the Buddhas of Bamyan to condemn his murder. =Reactions= Human rights organizations More than 20 activists of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, including Gulalai Ismail and Abdullah Nangyal, were arrested by the Pakistani government during protests against Arman's murder. Rabia Mehmood, South Asia Regional Researcher at Amnesty International, stated: “These protestors must be released immediately and unconditionally. They are prisoners of conscience and have done nothing but exercise their peaceful and lawful right to protest against human rights violations and call for end to them. It is shocking that the Pakistani authorities have resorted to such heavy-handed methods even as senior government officials have clearly acknowledged that the PTM has legitimate grievances that must be addressed. To add insult to injury, the crackdown follows the horrific death of Arman Luni, one of PTM’s activists.” Brad Adams, executive director of the Asian division of Human Rights Watch, said: “Pakistani officials should recognize the country’s diversity as a strength and not a weakness. The government should listen to and engage the concerns of the country’s many communities and allow for peaceful expression of dissent. As a start, the authorities should ensure the investigation into the death of Arman Luni is effective and transparent.” Afghan government Condemning the murder of Arman and the crackdown by Pakistani authorities against the nonviolent PTM activists, Ashraf Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, tweeted: “The Afghan government has serious concerns about the violence perpetrated against peaceful protestors and civil activists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.” He further said: “We believe it is the moral responsibility of every government to support civil activities that take a stand against the terrorism and extremism that plagues and threatens our region and collective security.” However, Mujib Rahman Rahimi, the spokesman of Afghanistan's Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, criticised Ashraf Ghani and termed his remarks as interference in another country's affairs. Rahimi said that the issues around PTM are \\"an internal matter of Pakistan. Afghanistan is not in a position which will interfere in others’ affairs. We have many problems and issues inside our country and it is better to address them first.\\" Shah Mehmood Qureshi, the Pakistani federal minister for foreign affairs, also rejected Ghani's tweet and called it a \\"gross interference\\" in the internal affairs of Pakistan. On the other hand, Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan interior minister who had resigned to join Ghani's team in the upcoming presidential elections, praised Ghani and called on the Afghan civil society to show \\"solid solidarity with the peaceful civil activists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan.\\" Responding to the allegation by Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Saleh said: “We [Afghanistan] have been on the receiving end of terror and Taliban for years sent and exported from your country [Pakistan]. We have just sent back a tweet. There is a gross imbalance in our bilateral trade and tweet.” Opposition parties in Pakistan The Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called for an \\"independent and transparent inquiry\\" into the \\"brutal killing\\" of Arman. Referring to the 'shutter down' strike in Balochistan on February 4, the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party senator Usman Kakar said in his speech to mourners: “This entire region is seething with anger. This is why everywhere from Quetta [in the south] to Sherani in the north is voluntarily observing a complete shutdown.” Medical reports The initial autopsy conducted by Mohammad Saleem Abro, the medical superintendent of Quetta's Civil Sandeman hospital, concluded that there were \\"no torture marks on Arman Loni's body\\". Abro stated that Loni's medical reports including the X-rays, were sent to a forensic laboratory in Lahore to ascertain the cause of death. Abro also said that the postmortem was conducted in the presence of \\"10 health experts, including the ones which were recommended by the family members of the deceased.\\" See alsoKilling of Naqeebullah Mehsud *Tahir Dawar References 1983 births 2019 deaths Pashtun people People from Ziarat District Pashtun Tahafuz Movement politicians University of Balochistan alumni Pashto-language poets ","title":"Arman Loni"},{"id":"59980327","text":"Argentina Fans Kaattoorkadavu is a 2019 Indian Malayalam-language film directed by Midhun Manuel Thomas, starring Kalidas Jayaram and Aishwarya Lekshmi in leading roles.

The 2019 version was the 23rd year in a row that AAA held a Rey de Reyes show and tournament. This event was attended by the American partner company All Elite Wrestling (Cody and The Young Bucks) where they began their partnership between companies. Production =Background= Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \\"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the'Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2019 show was the 23nd Rey de Reyes show in the series. =Storylines= The 2019 Rey de Reyes featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The welding process uses an induction coil to excite and heat electromagnetically susceptible material at the joint interface and melt the thermoplastic. The susceptible material can be contained in a gasket placed between the welding surface, or within the actual components of a composite material. Its usage is common for large, unusually shaped, or delicate parts that would be difficult to weld through other methods.  Physical Mechanisms  In non-magnetic electrical conductors like aluminum, nickel, or copper, an alternating electromagnetic field will induce Eddy currents in the material. These currents generate thermal energy through Joule heating. Ferromagnetic materials like iron and carbon steels will see heating from both Eddy current formation and Hysteresis losses.  Welding Process  = Material Considerations = Induction heating is an efficient method of heating electrically conductive or magnetic materials. Warm-up times are minimal and direct contact with the part is not needed. Unfortunately most thermoplastics are non-magnetic and excellent insulators. To take advantage of induction heating for thermoplastic welding purposes, a susceptible implant must be used as an intermediary material. Nearly any electrical conductor or ferromagnetic material may be used as an implant. Implant styles include meshes, fibers, and fine powders. The most common gasket design is a thermoplastic composite with suspended susceptible fibers. . This composite gasket can be formed into any shape required for the welding application. The gasket matrix is typically made of the same thermoplastic being welded. In situations where two dissimilar materials are to be welded, the gasket material is usually a blend of the two thermoplastics.  Composite Materials  Carbon fiber is of interest due to its widespread use in composite materials. Provided there are closed loops of carbon within the composite structure, eddy currents can be induced in the material. Unidirectional carbon fiber composites can have poor susceptibility when fiber to fiber contact is limited. Focusing heat only at the weld point is difficult with susceptible composite fibers throughout the material. In carbon fiber composites, thin electrically insulating layers with non-aligned fibers may be inserted between conducting layers to electrically isolate the joint surface from the material bulk. Using this technique, induction heating of the bulk is avoided. = Equipment = An induction generator is used to produce high frequency current in the range of 2-10 Mhz. The range used is regulated by the FCC to avoid interference with broadcast signals. An induction coil converts the high frequency current from the induction generator into the necessary alternating magnetic field. A single turn coil may be used when space is limited, however multiturn coil designs are more common due to their generation of a stronger and deeper penetrating magnetic field. Split coil designs are also available, which may be dissasembeled to fully surround a large part such as plastic piping. The high currents used in induction welding produce large amounts of heat in the coil. To avoid overheating, the coil turns are made with hollow tubing, and water is circulated during welding. Coil heat is dissipated by an attached heat exchanger. Fixtures are used to hold the parts in position during welding. One fixture is fixed and the other moveable so that a press may apply and maintain pressure during heating and cooling. = Welding Steps = Steps of implant induction welding in a tongue in groove joint. An implant rich gasket is placed at the surface to be welded. Pressure is applied to the joint to force out air cavities and ensure a sound bond. An electromagnetic field is applied by the induction coil to heat the implants, and pressure is applied to the joint. Heat conducts into the surrounding thermoplastic, which melts the gasket and creates a melt layer at the joint surfaces. The applied pressure flows the molten thermoplastic and fills the joint. When sufficient bonding has been achieved, the induction coil is turned off and the joint is cooled under pressure. For large items with long joints, the joint can be welded continuously by scanning the active coil along the length of the interface. = Parameters =  Power  Typical induction generators provide a power output of 1-5 kWs. High power output is necessary for longer and larger joints. Power output must also be increased as coil distance from the joint increases, due to electromagnetic field decay.  Pressure  Even distribution of the molten polymer in the joint is imperative for strong bonding. Weld pressure must be sufficient to induce squeeze flow in the molten gasket, achieve intimate contact with the joint surface, and fill the joint.  Weld Time and Cooling Time  Weld time will vary based on the joint size, the volume of susceptible implant material, and the power and frequency. Cycle times can be very fast since no preheating is needed, and heat generation happens exclusively at the weld joint. This also benefits the cooling time. With little heat wasted on the bulk of the part, cooling is brief. Under 1 second for some applications. A flat to flat and flat to groove joint used in implant induction welding. = Joint Design = Unusual joint designs are possible using implant induction welding. The simplest is the flat to flat joint, where a gasket is placed between two thermoplastic plates. This joint is common for continuous welding processes, or long weld lines where the active coil is scanned along the joint interface. The flat to groove joint uses a plate with a channel to accurately align the weld versus the flat to flat joint. The tongue in groove joint is similar to the flat to groove joint, but has the advantage of complete encapsulation of the gasket and a pressure tight seal.  Applications  = Food Packaging = Tetra Pak containers sealed by implant induction welding. Implant induction welding is heavily used in the production of Tetra Pak containers for products like juice boxes. The use of induction heating shortens the sealing time versus other joining methods that use external heat, and avoids damage to the paperboard layer from direct contact with hot tooling. An aluminum foil layer is used to block oxygen diffusion into the packaging, so no additional implant material is needed. = Automotive Manufacturing = The automotive industry makes large scale use of implant induction welding for the manufacture of large plastic items such as bumpers, plastic body panels, and fuel tanks. Manufacturing costs of components with complex geometries are brought down by manufacturing the parts in separate pieces, to be assembled later using induction welding. = Tamper Proof Packaging = Polyethylene coated aluminum foil is induction welded to the top of many food, supplement, and drug containers. The seal helps retain product quality and provides evidence of tampering.  Advantages and Disadvantages  = Advantages = Implant induction welding does not require physical contact with a heat source, so it is useful for joining components with unusual dimensions or delicate surfaces. * The induction coil can be moved continuously to heat the entire surface of long joints. Extremely large parts can be effectively welded using this method. * Heat generation is limited to the exact area where it is required for joining, so thermal stress generated by welding is low. * The joint can be reopened using induction heating for repairs or recycling. * The heating and joining steps are simultaneous, so cycle times are short. = Disadvantages = There are additional costs due to the implant and gasket material. Custom tooling may also be required for some part designs. This can make the method cost prohibitive for small and simple items. * Heating is limited by the penetration depth of the electromagnetic field. Care must be taken to avoid uneven heating in complex joint designs. * Implant material at the joint can have an impact on strength. * The electromagnetic field may affect metallic or electronic components of the part.

His feast day is 18 July. partial view of the sarcophagus with the saint's oldest image Biography Neither his exact year of birth nor his birthplace are known. Some sources maintain he came from Greece (Latin: Graecia); others suggest that in the oldest extant copy of the Latin Vita Sancti Arnoldi Confessoris a spelling mistake occurred: rather than Greece, the Latin name for the Austrian town of Graz (Graetia) was implied. Jacob Schmid, who had published an extensive collection of saint legends in the 18th century, including the Legend of Arnoldus, also questioned Arnold's Greek origins and suggested instead that he came from Raetia, an ancient Roman province reaching from the north of present-day Italy to the south of present-day Switzerland. Arnold died probably around 800 in Ginizuuilere (=Ginizwilere=Ginnizweiler, later renamed Arnoldsweiler), where he was buried. His grave is still revered there today in St. Arnold's Chapel. In an imprint of the Acta Sanctorum of the Bollandists from 1725, the death of Arnold was assumed to have occurred at the beginning of the 9th century; in Stadler's Complete Lexikon of Saints of 1840 it is restated that he died around 800. Arnold Steffens in 1886 sets the death date to 843, similar to the Bollandists. Rudolf Wyrsch in 1994 again places it around 800. The 21st century scholar Wilhelm Arnolds professes the year of St. Arnold's death to be 793. Recognition Between 922 and 1168, his death and burial place was renamed after his name into Arnoldsweiler (wilre sancti Arnoldi), which today forms a district of Düren. Arnold has been revered as a people's saint at least since that time and is considered the patron saint of musicians, organists, and makers of musical instruments, and to pray for a good and gentle death. In addition to a document from 1339, there only is an express earliest mention of his person in the transcript of his Vita, so only about 500 years after his death. Because of this, at times even the legitimacy of his veneration as a saint was doubted. In 1886, Pope Leo XIII recognized the cult for the Archdiocese of Cologne and confirmed the then about 1000 years old tradition. In 1914, the festival on Saint Arnold's Day, 18 July, was classified as a memorial day. Since 1987 it has been recognized as optional memorial for the Diocese of Aachen. Life and legends The Vita Sancti Arnoldi Confessoris was not only copied, but also translated and retold. As little documentary evidence exists in writing, it cannot be determined with certainty how far Saint Arnold's biography is based on real facts, or if with the passage of time it was interlaced with legends. =The ride around the Bürgewald= Arnold accompanied Emperor Charlemagne and his entourage on hunts in the Bürgewald (a forest area north of Düren between Aachen and Cologne, bordered by the rivers Rur and Erft). One day the king decided to hold a banquet in the forest. Arnold saw the poverty of the villagers when they approached to ask for firewood, stating that the forest was royal property and they did not dare to take anything from the forest floor. Arnold challenged the emperor in a bet to give him as much forest land as he could circle on horseback while the banquet lasted. The wish was granted to him. The crafty Arnold arranged for fresh horses in the surrounding villages and managed to circumnavigate the entire forest before the meal was over. Charlemagne was fond of Arnold and forgave him the ruse, which exploited his by nature generous disposition. He gave Arnold a ring to testify that the forest henceforth belonged to him. Arnold distributed the Bürgewald territory amongst the surrounding villages. This good deed of his led to his being worshiped as a saint. For centuries, the forest was used by the adjacent villages. In one extension of the legend one of the horses was exhausted and a maid refused to give it water. The horse then scraped the ground with its hoof and a spring of water arose that still bears the name Arnolduspötzsche (Arnoldusquelle/Saint Arnold Fountain) today. The woman refusing to share water is said to have been from the village of Huchem-Stammeln (today in the municipality of Niederzier). This village was excluded from the right to use the forest and its name is missing from the stone tablet in Saint Arnold's Chapel, where 15 of the villages grateful to Saint Arnold are listed. =The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela= Arnold's documented pilgrimage to the tomb of the apostle James the Great in Santiago de Compostela, Spain is embellished by another tale: In southern France the aged Arnold came to an area where it had not rained for weeks and the residents were starving. Arnold decided to stop and help alleviate the misery of the people. His own strength began to subside, and, feeling close to death, he wished to die in his homeland. He prayed to God for a sign he received in a dream. Arnold then threw the ring Charlemagne had given him into the Garonne. The reappearance of the ring would alert him to his imminent death. On his journey home north to the Rhineland, he rested for a time at a pious widow's house. One day he gave alms to the poor in the village and they brought their benefactor a fish from the market that had swallowed a ring. Arnold recognized his ring, thanked God for the miracle and resumed his journey home. He reached the village Ginnizweiler and died soon afterwards. Patron saint to Arnold Janssen Saint Arnold of Arnoldsweiler is the patron saint of Father Arnold Janssen, the founder of the Steyl missionaries (Societas Verbi Divini). Arnold Janssen was canonized on 5 October 2003. The Mission House St. Arnold was founded by the Steyl missionaries in 1928 in Neuenkirchen (Steinfurt district). The nearby train station of Neuenkirchen was renamed in 1931 to St. Arnold station and the surrounding quarter became officially known as St. Arnold.

The Rococo-style main building was built for Tyge Rothe in 1653. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. The estate covers 475 hectares of land. History =Early history= Tybjerggaard is one of the oldest manor houses in Denmark. Its history dates back to the 13th century when it was owned by Jens Sjællandsfar. In 1325 it was passed on to his daughter, Margrete, the widow of Henrik Eberstein. Their daughter, Cecilie Eberstein, married another member of the Eberstein family who later sold Tybjerggaard to Peder Basse. Over the next centuries, its ownership was generally shared between multiple owners. This came to an end when Jacob Andersen Bjørn in the 1490s married Margrete Poulsdatter. Bjørn was also the owner of Voergaard and Støvringgaard but died shortly after the wedding. After his death Margrethe managed the estates for many years, but she lived mostly at Støvringgård. Their son Anders died unmarried in 1536. The daughter Dorte Bjørn was married twicefirst time to Christopher Hak of Egholm and second time to Oluf Glob of Vellumgårdbut there were no children in either marriage After her death in circa 1562 the estate went to her cousin Anne Bjørnsdatter's children. The cousin was married to Niels Kaas. Tybjerggaard went to their son Bjørn Kaas while his brothers, Niels and Erik Kaas, inherited Støvringgård. Bjørn Kaas was also the owner of Staarupgård and lensmann of Vordingborg Castle. His son, Gabriel Kaas, ceded Tybjerggaard to Frederik Quitzow in exchange for other property in 1596. Quitzow had no children either and Tybjerggaard was therefore passed on to his wife's niece, Pernille Banner, who was married to Esge Krafse. Pernille Banner's eldest son, Erik Banner, had bought out his four brothers after their mother's death. In 1672, Tybjerggaard was acquired by Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve. A few years later he sold it to Peter Brandt who in turn sold it to the Crown. Christian V granted Tybjerggaard to Adam Levin Knuth. In 1689, he sold it back to the crown. It was then ceded to Margrete Wilders as payment of an old debt to her late husband, the merchant rederik Werdelmann (died 1687). Wilders were involved in a number of unsuccessful lawsuits to try to get arrears out her husband's old customers. She died on the estate in 1709. She left it to her niece, Margrete von Heinen, whose husband, Willum Braem. an infantry lieutenant, died in Austria in October that same year. She later married Georg Lepel. After her death in 1717, he converted the main building into a hospital for blind and invalids of the parish. In 1824, Lepel sold Tybjerggaard to Frederik von Maase. His widow, Conradine Sophie Rostgaard, sold the estate to Peder West in 1735. . =Tyge Rothe= Thyge Rothe In 1763, Tybjerggaard was acquired by Tyge Rothe. He had become wealthy through his recent marriage to Karen Bjørn, the only child of the late merchant and shipyard-owner Andreas Bjørn. He gave up his position in the Colonial Administration Authority (Generaltoldkammeret) to concentrate on managing the estate. Four of Rothe's six children were born at Tybjerggaard. Among these were the later Governor General of the Danish West Indies Carl Adolph Rothe and civil servant and Supreme Court justice Christian Hjørn Rothe. Johann Friedrich Struensee appointed him as head of the new Finanskollegium's Department of Agriculture in 1771 but it was dissolved after Struense's fall from power and instead appointed as Country Governor in Segeberg. After nine months he was also dismissed from this post. He then settled on the Tubjerggaard estate and committed the rest of his life to his writings. He introduced many improvements in the management of the estate and started the implementation of the new agricultural reforms. His son, Andreas Bjørn Rothe, sold Tybjerggaard. =Neergaard and Steinmann families= August Schiøtt: Frederik, Steinmann In 1804, Tybjerggaard was acquired by Jacob Neergaard. He was the sixth child of Johan Thomas de Neergaard, the owner of Ringsted Abbey, Merløsegaard and Kærup, who had been ennobled under the name de Neergaard in 1780. His wife, Sophie Magdalene Dinesen[1], was a daughter of Anders Ninesen at Gyldenholm Manor. Tybjerggaard in 1870 Jacob de Neergaard died in 1833. In 1835, his widow brought Tybjerggaard into her second marriage with Peter Frederik Steinmann, who had previously been married to her late husband's younger sister Johanne (Hanne) de Neergaard (1792-1824). Peter Frederik Steinmann's son by his first wife, who was also named Peter Frederik Steinmann, inherited Tybjerggaard in 1866. He was also a military officer and had served in the Second Schleswig War. In 1874–75, he briefly served as Minister of War in the Cabinet of Fonnesbech. He gad been married to Anne Elisabeth Johanne Schulin, Comtesse of Frederiksdal, but she had already died in 1947. Steinmann survived her by 47 years. Their son, again named Peter Frederik Steinmann, succeeded his father on the estate in 1894. His widow, Marie, a daughter of the navel officer, politician and editor Johan Cornelius Tuxen, lived on the estate until her death in 1952 Architecture The Rococo-style main building was built for Tyge Rothe in 1763. It is a single-storey, three-winged complex. The main wing features a higher median risalit topped by a triangular pediment on both sides of the building. The east wing incorporates elements from an older building, probably Margrethe Wilders' main wing from the 1690s. The vaulted cellar dates from the 15th century. The oldest of the farm buildings date from 1877. Others were added in 1917, 1927, 1958 in 1993. Today The current owner is Bent Jeppesen. The estate covers 475 hectares of land. Tybjerggaard- Fuglsang, one of the largest pig breeders in Denmark, is headquartered on the estate. It operates a number of production sites on Zealand and breeds Landrace, Yorkshire and Duroc pigs.

Initially a painter and graphic artist, he was the founder of an art academy and later became a pioneer of light art and video art. Biography Livinus van de Bundt in 1964, at the Sikkens Prize awards ceremony. Photo Joop van Bilsen/Anefo. Livinus Arie Cornelis Jan van de Bundt was born 5 March 1909 in Zeist. His father was Jan van de Bundt (1887–1970), his mother Sijgje Cornelia van der Vlies (1885–1961). Livinus had two sisters, Corry and Kiki. Livinus started painting aged 14. From 1929 to 1931 he worked for Koninklijke Begeer. He enrolled at the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague in 1932, but left prematurely in 1934 after a number of conflicts. In 1937 he went to Paris to study with Stanley Hayter at Atelier 17 for a year. A 1938 exhibition of his abstract work was not well received, provoking him to destroy his work. Aged 30 he gave up painting, unable to achieve the brilliance he envisaged. For several years he produced only graphic work in black and white. During World War II Livinus van de Bundt applied his graphic skills to forge passports. In 1947 he founded the Vrije Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague and remained its director until 1964. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics. He started working with light, using a variety of materials. His chronopeintures contained illuminated pieces of colored plastic. Livinus' secretive luminodynamical machine, built in the 1950s from lenses, bulbs and electronic components, enabled the operator to generate color effects using a keyboard. He built a drum kit which triggered light effects when hit. Van de Bundt married Mieke van der Burgt (18 April 1917–9 June 1979), herself an artist working in graphics, ceramics and textiles. The pair had a daughter, Livina van de Bundt, and a son, Jeep van de Bundt, who became an artist, musician and later a classic car dealer. In 1970, while on a visit to Intermedia in Vancouver, Livinus started experimenting with video. He produced several video art projects, together with his son. Livinus van de Bundt died 11 October 1979 in The Hague.

The Times of India critic rated 3 out of 5 stars and wrote that it is a \\"run-of-the-mill thriller made for you to like and be in awe of the hero. It is demanding you to like him and root for him, sometimes out of sympathy and the other times for his intelligence.

In most murders, he killed his victims by inflicting numerous blows with a knife, including one to the neck, which caused the victim's death.  Biography  Gennady Ivanov was born in 1947 in the Chuvash ASSR, and later served in Baikonur as part of a secret military service. After demobilization, approximately in 1973, he committed his first murder during a domestic quarrel, for which he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He collaborated with the colony's administration, and thanks to denunciations, in 1980, 7 years after his conviction, he was granted parole. He got a job at GAZ, but soon quit, beginning to commit crimes in the autumn of 1980. The first instance was at night, when Ivanov tried to rape a girl named Anna Kovaleva, but she was saved by passers-by. That same night, he made another unsuccessful attack on another girl. The second victim received several knife wounds, but survived and was able to describe her assailant. After two weeks, Ivanov raped and killed Nina Sinitsyna, stealing 200 rubles from her. With this money, he bought himself new clothes, and, pretending to be a public toilet cleaner, entered a cubicle and changed his bloodied clothing. A few days later, Ivanov killed a man and took his shoes, leaving his own at the crime scene. On the same day, he killed another man, Konstantin Aleksandrov, stealing 1100 rubles and another pair of shoes from his victim. A few weeks later, he attacked two girls who were using a payphone. One of them, 28-year-old Nadezhda Slepova, was killed by the suffered knife wounds. The second girl, although heavily injured, was able to escape, but died from her wounds at the hospital. Before her death, the victim managed to describe her assailant. Soon after, Ivanov killed a WWII veteran, which spread panic around the city. Later, in the village of Vurnary in the Chuvash ASSR, he killed a woman during a domestic quarrel. On that same day, he committed another rape, after which he was detained. During a search on his home, women's jewelry belonging to his victims were located in his home. During interrogations, Ivanov constantly called himself \\"The King\\" - now in the jungle, now in the underworld. He was sentenced to death by firing squad, and in 1982, the sentence was carried out. = In the media = Documentary film from the series \\"The investigation was conducted...\\" - \\"The king of the jungle\\" * Documentary film from the series \\"Legends of the Soviet Investigation\\" - \\"Operation 'The Beast'\\" See also List of Russian serial killers  References  Documentary film from the series \\"The investigation was conducted...\\" - \\"The king of the jungle\\" * Documentary film from the series \\"Legends of the Soviet Investigation\\" - \\"Operation 'The Beast'\\" People executed for murder People executed by the Soviet Union by firearm Soviet rapists Soviet serial killers Deaths in the Soviet Union 1982 deaths 1947 births Male serial killers People from Chuvashia Soviet people convicted of murder Executed Soviet serial killers ","title":"Gennady Ivanov"},{"id":"59981261","text":"Pasqua is a surname meaning \\"Easter\\" in Italian.

He is noted for his frank and animated diaries. Background Claver Morris was the son of William Morris, a clergyman of Manstone, Dorset. He was educated at New Inn Hall, Oxford, graduating with a BA in 1679, MA in 1682, BMed in 1685 and DMed in 1691. He became an extra licentiate of the College of Physicians in 1683. Morris initially practised in Salisbury before moving to Wells in 1686. The Diaries Morris's diaries cover the period from 1684 to 1726 and record his widespread medical practice in Wells, Somerset, and the surrounding area. They also record his landed interests in Baltonsborough, West Bradley, West Pennard, and elsewhere, and his part in the enclosures of Baltonsborough Northwood and of Glastonbury Common Moor. The diaries and accounts are contained in three manuscript volumes covering the period 1684 to 1726. The earliest volume records receipts and payments for the period 1684 to 1697, and the second volume records receipts and payments for 1709 to 1723, as well as diary entries for 1709 to 1710. The third volume, regarded as the most important as an historical source, contains diary entries only and covers the period 1718 to 1726.Edmond Hobhouse, The Diary of a West Country Physician, 1684-1726', 1934. Music Morris was also a gifted amateur musician and was the founder of the Wells Music Club which met at Wells Cathedral's Close Hall. In this he played an important role in the development of Wells' deep association with music now continued by Wells Cathedral School.

His father was the Provost of Renfrew and an MP for Renfrew. After university, he thought about becoming a church minister but could not, in good conscience, sign the Five Articles of Perth. He was converted after hearing a sermon from David Dickson in 1644. He was a writer which is a Scottish term for a lawyer. For example William Lin is described as a Writer to the Signet which would make him a senior lawyer. He became unpopular with some Glaswegian magistrates because of his opposition to Hugh Binning. According to rumours, he potentially fought for the Covenanters at the Battle of Kilsyth. Spreul and John Graham fought together at the Battle of Philiphaugh in September 1645. Spreul became town clerk of Glasgow on 21 October 1645. He fought for the Scottish Covenanters in the Battle of Dunbar. He is reported to have had a very long beard and to have been mocked for it before the Privy Council of Scotland. Imprisonment On 14 September 1660, Spreul was imprisoned in Edinburgh, along with Provost John Graham, for refusing to subscribe to the bond condemning the Western Remonstrance. However, he was then induced to subscribe to it, at which point he was released. Spreul and Graham had worked together and fought together. They both represented Glasgow during the time of Oliver Cromwell's rule. Banishment After being banished from Scotland for nonconformity, he lived for some years at Berwick-upon-Tweed and Newcastle before residing Holland, where he remained for several years. Return to Scotland An elderly and frail Spreul returned to Scotland, hoping to remain at home in peace. However, the government, instigated by the bishops, had him imprisoned at the Tollbooth of Edinburgh. He refused to hear the curates. He was therefore sent to the Bass Rock by the Privy Council on 28 July 1683, where he lay for some years. After petitioning to the Council to be more compassionate towards his old age and frailty, an order was issued for his liberation, and he died within a year or two. Relatives James Richard Sproule wrote an extensive study on the Spreul family, in which he distinguished John Spreul from his \\"cousin\\" or relative John Spreul, an apothecary: > A difficulty in presenting the story of Mr. John Spreull, Town Clerk of > Glasgow, is that for a portion of his life there is the danger of confusing > him with his \\"cousin\\"*, another John Spreull, an apothecary of Paisley and > then an apothecary and merchant of Glasgow. The latter became known as \\"Bass > John\\". The fact that the town clerk had a son also named John and that there > was another John Spreull who was a merchant of Glasgow adds further > complications. (p 86) James Sproule continues: > When original documents speak of \\"Mr. John Spreull\\", it is as good as > certain that the records refer to the town clerk. Again if the records speak > of John Spreull \\"Senior\\" or John Spreull \\"the Elder\\", and additionally state > that he was a \\"writer\\" (lawyer), there is little doubt that the references > are about the town clerk.

While in hiding, she used the pseudonym Carmen Delgado Palomares.  Biography  Mesa was born on 30 December 1913 in Ronda, Spain into a working-class family of anarchist tradition. She was very proud of this, saying \\"I am daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of anarchists\\". She was a relative of the typographer and prominent socialist internationalist José Mesa Leompart. When she was 11, she started working as a seamstress and, in 1928, when she was a 14-year-old, she moved with her family to Ceuta. There she joined the Sindicato de Actividades Diversas de la Federación Local ceutí of CNT where, as a woman, integrating was not easy, and of the city, taking charge of the library. Mesa participated in the creation of the Gremio de la Aguja of CNET, obtaining the card number 1. Her trade union activity was mainly directed to the organization of working women. During a strike at Almadraba de Ceuta, where the company hired Maghrebi women for half the salary of the Spanish women, she assisted them in joining the union in order to get better conditions for all. According to Mesa, \\"they joined us and in 24 hours we won the fight\\". In 1934, during a season and until his expulsion, she played in of the Tetuán that operated while being disguised as an Esperantist society. In 1936, again in Ceuta, she came into contact with the founding group of Mujeres Libres magazine. In Ceuta and Tetuán the Francoist coup of 16 July 1936 was successful. The repression was very strong and there were many executions by firing squad. Mesa helped many comrades to flee and managed to escape to the peninsula, arriving in Málaga in a fishing boat along with twelve men. In 1937, Mesa reached Valencia where she started a nursing course and then worked in the city and in Gandía. She participated in the constitution congress of the Federación Nacional de Mujeres Libres and became the general secretary of the local group of Valencia, assisting Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Pura Pérez Benavent, Amelia Torres Maeso and other compatriots in sharing their message.He was his representative in the National Committee of the CNT and in the Plenary of Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA) which was held in August 1938 in Valencia. The last days of the war, in March 1939, Mesa fled to the port of Alicante. When ships did not arrive with aid in support of Republicans, Mesa fled to Almería on foot. With a false name, she became involved with the anti-Franco struggle. In Málaga, in 1941 she created, together with other colleagues, the underground newspaper, El Faro de Málaga. Discovered by the Francoist police, Carmen Delgado Palomares, the name that appeared on his identity document from that moment and until the end of her life, Mesa managed to avoid prison and death, and fled again to Valencia. Her alter ego, Isabel Mesa, was prosecuted for rebellion and sentenced to two death sentences. Back in Valencia, in 1942, she promoted the creation of the collective Unión de Mujeres Demócratas, a clandestine organization dedicated to helping prisoners and other political activities. Mesa set up a kiosk with his fellow anarchist Angustias Lara (Maruja Lara), a friend since 1937, and in the backroom of a cafe, they distributed an anarchist publication. In 1956, she was arrested and for eight days was in police station. During the transition, she collaborated in the formation of groups libertarians like Libre Estudio, la Federación de Pensionistas de la CNT, Ràdio Klara and the Al Margen. She was a member of Mujeres Libres and the Fundación Salvador Seguí. She was later recognized by Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) for her work.

Career =Librarian= Jones began his career as an assistant librarian at the Institute of Historical Research in London, 1970–72, before returning to Wales for five years as the law librarian at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1972–77. In 1977, Lord Elwyn-Jones, Lord Chancellor in the Labour Government, recruited Jones to fill the post of deputy librarian of the House of Lords Library. This followed a report by a working group, led by David Eccles, 1st Viscount Eccles, that recommended creating a research service, hiring qualified librarians for the first time, acquiring updated books, and \\"dipping a toe in information technology\\". From 1977 to 1991, Jones, the first qualified librarian to serve in the post of deputy librarian, assisted Roger Morgan in transforming the librarian to modern standards. Working directly with Eccles, Jones oversaw the installation of the Geac ADVANCE multiuser integrated online library system \\"incorporating acquisitions, cataloguing and serials control features and online access to that catalogue.\\" Jones also create a significant programme for the conservation and cataloguing of the library's historic collections.

Boman was born August 16, 1924 in Engelbrekt Parish, Stockholm, Sweden, and died December 3, 2008. Boman's pioneering research on insect immunity formed the basis for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2011.Umeå professor linked to Nobel Prize winning research. https://www.umu.se/en/news/umea-professor-linked-to-nobel-prize-winning- research_5832655/  Biography  Hans G. Boman graduated from Uppsala University, where he obtained his PhD in biochemistry in 1958 with Professor Arne Tiselius. He completed his post-doctoral studies at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. During his stay in New York, he married Anita Boman, who then became his main research partner. They returned to Sweden and Uppsala University in 1960 where he established a research group at the Department of Biochemistry. In 1966 Boman was appointed professor of microbiology at Umeå University. Between 1966 and 1976 he built up the Department of Microbiology at Umeå University, where his research focused on mechanisms for bacterial antibiotic resistance. Boman combined physiological, molecular, biochemical and genetic methods in a way that was unique at that time. In 1976, Boman became professor of microbiology at Stockholm University where his work in moths identified the first antimicrobial peptides of animals in 1981. He later moved to the Microbiological and Tumor Biology Center at the Karolinska Institute in 1997. At the Karolinska Institute, he identified a disease that occurs in connection with antimicrobial peptides.  Research  During his time in Umeå, Boman collaborated with Bertil Rasmusson at the Department of Genetics. In a famous back-and-forth exchange, Boman put forth unto Rasmusson: \\"'Do fruit flies ever get sick?' (Boman). 'Very rarely,' (Rasmuson). 'Then they must have an efficient immune response!' (Boman).\\" Their work asked how insects can survive infections without having a system of B cells and T cells, at the time thought to be essential for immune defence. They examined the immune system of fruit flies and could show that flies that were once infected with a non-lethal dose of the bacterium Pseudomonas survived a second higher dose while flies that received the same high dose for the first time died. Boman continued to investigate the immune response of insects, focussing on the proteins induced by immune challenge. This posed technical challenges that required a larger insect capable of donating more hemolymph (insect blood). His eventual choice was the Cecropia silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia). In 1981, Boman's group published the protein structure of the antimicrobial peptide cecropin, the first animalian antimicrobial peptide described. With techniques for cloning genes, Boman's group was able to continue studies on immune genes in Cecropia. At the same time, the field of innate immunity rapidly expanded, benefitting from the genetic tools available in Drosophila in the search to understand how insect immunity recognizes and signals following infection. From these initial studies, a number of insect antimicrobial peptides and other immune proteins were characterized, and these peptides have been used extensively as readouts of immune challenge. Owing to Boman's discovery, immune-inducible peptides were used to identify competent or deficient immune responses, ultimately leading to the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine being awarded to Jules Hoffmann for his work on insect immune signalling.  Awards and Honors  Boman was awarded the Fernström Prize for outstanding work in medicine in 2000. The Nordic scientific community mourned his loss in 2008, both with a posthumous acknowledgement of his lifetime's achievements in 2009, and by hosting the “Hans G. Boman” symposium held by Stockholm University on the 10-year anniversary of his death. In 2015, a family of immune-inducible peptides in Drosophila was named the \\"Bomanins\\" in Boman's honour.

She takes her leave of her husband, ostensibly to go to visit a friend in the provinces, but in fact to appear before the footlights that evening. Beneath the calm surface of life at Volumnia House complications have already been brewing. One of Mrs Queckett's pupils has been privately married before the Registrar to her almost equally juvenile and absurdly jealous fiancé, Mr Reginald Paulover. This girl's name is Dinah, and she is the daughter of Rear-Admiral Archibald Rankling, an old sea-lion of the hoarsest, gruffest, and most savage sort. The proposal of Mr Paulover for the hand of Miss Rankling has been received by the young lady's parents with the sternest refusal, and has been followed by her immediate seclusion in Volumnia College. In the absence of his wife, Queckett determines to invite a few friends to supper, and telegraphs accordingly to his old friend, Lieut. John Mallory. This telegram falls into the hands of a pupil, Peggy Hesslerigge, who uses it as a lever to induce Queckett to include her schoolfellows, Gwendoline Hawkins and Ermyntrude Johnson, in his invitation. Queckett is reluctantly obliged to spend on the party with its unexpectedly large guest list the money left with him by his wife to pay the rent, the fire insurance, and the servants' wages. Mallory arrives, and brings with him his friend Rear-Admiral Rankling; and, as Dinah and her young husband are also present, it is fortunate that the Admiral has been too long at sea to be able to recognise his daughter. Supper is followed by a dance, which is in full swing when the servant runs in with the news that the boy in buttons has set the house on fire in playing with fireworks. The fire brigade arrive, and the escape is planted outside the windows of the class-room ; and the pupils escape by one, whilst Mrs Queckett, in the full attire of a queen of opera bouffe, enters at the other. There ensues a series of tête-à-têtes, explanations and reconciliations leading to a resolution satisfactory to all parties. :Source: The Era. Critical reception The reviewers praised Pinero's skill and that of the cast. The Era commented that the final act amounted almost to a series of sketches, not all relevant to the working out of the plot, but very funny nonetheless. The Pall Mall Gazette commented that many of the audience must have gone home with aching sides, and thought the plot more farcical than Pinero had attempted before, and considered the piece among the cleverest and best-acted farces for a good many years.Mr. Pinero's New Play\\", The Mall Gazette, 30 March 1886, p. 5 Revivals The play was given at the Standard Theatre, New York, in December 1886 by the company of Rosina Vokes, but had a fairly short run of 28 performances. In the 20th century it was revived in London at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1913, the Arts Theatre in 1949, the Savoy Theatre, in April 1964, and in Manchester at the Royal Exchange Theatre, in February 1979.

The late-19th century Victorian structure, designed by Edward I'Anson, is a grade II listed building. It is a largely symmetrical building, asymmetrically composed from a variety of Arts and Crafts and Flemish Renaissance elements. It was built in red brick in Flemish bond with terracotta dressings, and features a clock tower and a large bathing hall. A plaque in the main stair hall dates the building to 1895. The building was used by the local population for swimming, bathing and doing laundry. The baths had a first- and second- class pool for men, as well as a pool for women known as the \\"small swim\\". Mixed-gender swimming was introduced in 1904. The baths also had 74 individual bathing cubicles (most originally only for men), showers and a laundry room.\\"Manor Place Baths\\", Exploring Southwark and discovering its history\\"Manor Place\\", This Is Elephant and Castle, Elephant and Castle Partnership The first-class pool was 120 ft long and boarded over in winter so that the space could be used for sporting events, concerts and other public meetings. In particular, the baths were a popular venue for both amateur and professional boxing. Boxing at the baths started in 1908 and boxers who fought bouts there included the Kray twins as well as Ken Buchanan, Johnny Clark, Henry Cooper, Cornelius Boza-Edwards, Albert Finch, Dick Richardson and Terry Spinks. In total some 230 boxing shows and 1500 bouts were held at the baths.Catherine Johnston, \\"Celebration of Old Boxing Club at Manor Place Baths Will Raise Money for Fighters' Families\\", Southwark News, 11 April 2018  History  The baths were built by the vestry of Newington to improve public hygiene and health. Construction on the baths began in 1895, and the baths officially opened on 16 March 1898, leading the mayor of New York City to state: \\"There is no public bathing establishment even approximating this in the United States.\\" The building survived heavy bombing of the area in World War II. It began to fall into disuse as public baths in the decades after the war as most apartments in the area began to have bathrooms installed. It was used by locals to do laundry up until the 1970s. The baths closed as a public facility in 1976 but continued as a boxing venue until a final show in 1978. By 1995 it was in a dangerously poor condition with no viable use. In 1996 it was Grade II-listed and placed on the Buildings at Risk Register by English Heritage. The building was used by Southwark London Borough Council as offices until 2005, when Tibetan Buddhist organisation Kagyu Samye Dzong London obtained a five-year lease to use the building as a temporary home while their new Bermondsey location was being renovated. They renovated the building and opened it under the name Manor Place Samye Dzong on 17 March 2007.Kagyu Samye Dzong London at Manor Place Kagyu Samye Dzong London The building was used as a meditation centre with regular classes and retreats until 2015. In late 2013, the baths (as well as the adjacent recycling depot) were purchased by Notting Hill Housing to be converted into residential accommodation and commercial space. On 21 April 2018, the Essex Ex-Boxers’ Association staged a boxing reunion at Manor Place Baths to raise funds for the family of boxer Scott Westgarth, who died in February of that year after sustaining injuries in a fight.

It was used in Lucia Chase's Bluebird ballet.  Composition  This arrangement was initially commissioned by Lucia Chase, the founding director of the Ballet Theatre, in January 1941. The commission consisted of a short arrangement of the four parts composing the No. 25, Pas de deux de l'Oiseau bleu et la Princesse Florine, in Act III of Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Though, initially, Tchaikovsky intended this to be a pas de quatre, Marius Petipa changed it in the original production, hence Stravinsky's title. This was Stravinsky's first commission as an expatriate in the United States. Stravinsky re-scored the piece in a few days and, according to fellow composer Robert Craft, he enjoyed his work. Given the fact that only portions of the score had gotten to the United States by this time, and were only available in the form of piano reductions, this was a re-orchestration on the part of Stravinsky, which is why it is often entitled a \\"re-scoring\\" by other Stravinsky experts. This was not the first time Stravinsky orchestrated a segment from The Sleeping Beauty, as he also orchestrated a very brief solo variation in Act II (No. 15b) and the Entr'acte that opened the following scene (No. 18). On this occasion, the arrangement was composed as commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev. However, in the case of Bluebird, Stravinsky had to adapt to the company's orchestra's condition, as it had been depleted by the military draft just months before the US involvement in World War II. Bluebird Pas de Deux was eventually published by Schott Music and, later, by Chester Music.  Structure  As in the original, this short ballet consists of four movements: Bluebird Pas de Deux is scored for a large ensemble consisting of a flute, an oboe, two clarinets, a bassoon, a French horn, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani, and a string section consisting of five violins, four violas, three cellos and two double basses. As an original addition, Stravinsky did not actually reduce the orchestra, but rather chose to include a piano to provide a new element to help articulation and sonority. According to Stravinsky himself, \\"the prominent piano part [...] helps to conceal the small number of strings\\" in Bluebird Pas de Deux.  Recordings  This is one of the least published and performed pieces by Stravinsky. Following is a short list of recordings of this piece: * Robert Craft recorded the piece with the Twentieth Century Classics Ensemble at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York City on October 28, 2008. The recording was released in 2011 by Naxos Records.

In 1924 he joined the general practice of Joshua Williamson (b. 1874), who was a general practitioner and also held an appointment as honorary surgeon to Grimsby Hospital. At the Grimsby Hospital, Brown became honorary pathologist and then honorary physician. He qualified MRCP in 1930 and was elected FRCP in 1942. He was a general practitioner, in partnership with Williamson (who became his father-in-law), at Cleethorpes from 1924 to 1931 and at Grimsby from 1931 to 1938. In 1938 he abandoned general practice to become a consultant physician, and later cardiologist, to the Grimsby Hospital and the Scunthorpe General Hospital. In 1930 he joined David Clark Muir in running a paediatric heart clinic at Hull. The clinic developed into a referral centre for congenital heart disease. Brown wrote with Evan Bedford the section on congenital heart disease in volume 6 of the British Encyclopaedia of Medical Practice (1937, London, Butterworth & Co., Ltd.). Brown's book Congenital Heart Disease (1939) was of some importance in the development of cardiac surgery. In 1943 he gave the Bradshaw Lecture.

Purpose  A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\".  Extent  Hluleka Marine Protected Area is in the Eastern Cape Province. about 20 km south of Port St Johns. 4 km of coastline and 40.86 km2 of ocean are protected. = Boundaries =Northern boundary: A line bearing 135° True from a beacon at approximately S31°,50′ E29°17.76′ in the Hluleka Nature Reserve where the game fence near the northern boundary of the nature reserve reaches the high-water mark *Eastern boundary: A line six nautical miles to seaward of the high-water mark *Southern boundary: A line bearing 135° True from a beacon at approximately S31°,48.82′ E29°19.14′ in the Hluleka Nature Reserve where the game fence near the southern boundary of the nature reserve reaches the high- water mark *Western boundary: The high-water mark between approximately S31°,48.82′ E29°19.14′ and approximately S31°,50′ E29°17.76′ = Zonation = The whole MPA is zoned as a no-take zone.  Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency, which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Geography  = Climate = = Seasonal variations in sea conditions =  Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Hluleka Marine Protected Area is in the Agulhas ecoregion The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near- horizontal crevices. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. = Marine species diversity =  Animals  Marine mammals: * southern right whale * humpback whale * humpback dolphin * bottlenose dolphin  Seaweeds   Endemism  The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River.

Of Māori descent, he identified with the Ngāti Porou iwi (tribe). He was born in Tokomaru Bay, East Coast, New Zealand. He was the son of Hone Te Pahewa and Te Pakou o Hinekau. Pahewa attended the Waerenga-a-hika school at the mission of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), which had been established by the Rev. William Williams. On 4 October 1863 he was ordained as a deacon and he was assigned to the Diocese of Waiapu as the minita (minister) at Tokomaru. Tokomaru Pariha (parish) was established by Pahewa and the chief Henare Potae. It was the second Anglican parish established by the Ngati Porou. Hikurangi Pariha was established by the chief Ropata Wahawaha and Reverend Raniera Kawhia in 1860. In 1865 there were fourteen clergymen – six European and eight Māori – in the Diocese of Waiapu. The Māori were: at Tokomaru, Matiaha Pahewa; at Wairoa, Tamihana Huata; at Turanga, Hare Tawhaa; at Waiapu, Rota Waitoa, Raniera Kawhia and Mohi Turei; at Table Cape, Watene Moeka; at Maketu, Ihaia Te Ahu. By 1865 the Pai Mārire movement (commonly known as Hauhau) was active on the East Coast; at Tokomaru, Pahewa continued to visit the Hauhau as long as they were willing to accept his ministrations, although by so doing so he incurred the wrath of Henare Potae, who looked upon his action as identifying himself with their movement. On 13 July 1897, he together with Mohi Tūrei, Eruera Kawhia and Piripi Awarau, assisted the Rev. H. Williams in conducting the burial service for Ropata Wahawaha, who had fought the Hauhau. Pahewa undertook theological study at St. Stephen’s College in Auckland. On 22 September 1878 he was ordained as a priest by Bishop Edward Stuart and was assigned to the Diocese of Waiapu. He remained at Tokomaru Bay until his death on 5 June 1906. His son was the Rev. Hakaraia Pahewa (c1871-1949), who was appointed to the Diocese of Waiapu in Te Kaha Maori District, which was on the road from Opotiki to East Cape.

Contents The book provides information on Klingon sociolinguistics including: regional vocabulary, variation between the speech of younger and older generations, idioms, slang, dialects, and specialized vocabulary relating to food, warfare, the visual arts and music. It contains an addendum to the wordlist appearing in The Klingon Dictionary with expanded definitions and new words. This list includes the new vocabulary items that were first published in The Klingon Way. Since the publication of The Klingon Dictionary, many new words pertaining to Klingon culture appeared in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Frequently, the Klingon appearing in the shows was inconsistent with the vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation set out in The Klingon Dictionary (see the Klingon language in Star Trek canon). These discrepancies are explained in Klingon for the Galactic Traveler as being the result of special constructions, archaic forms, or ritual language. The book explains some points of grammar, like the use of the -neS suffix and apparent inconsistencies in Okrand's earlier work (like non-use of the verb prefix lu- and special variant word order used in toasts).

He got his nickname for being imprisoned on the Bass Rock for around 6 years on the charge of being present at outdoor religious meetings. Some seventeenth century church services were attended by armed defensive militia since the regime sent soldiers who attacked those at unauthorised meetings. A verdict of not proven was returned on charges that he supported those defeated at Bothwell Bridge and despite being tortured, twice, using the boot confessed no wrong-doing. Spreul's wife died while he was in prison and he petitioned for his full release, rather than being sent to the American plantations as a slave, when in 1686 there were some concessions from the regime. Spreul was liberated but initially refused to leave since the release order contained statements which he regarded as falsehoods. After freedom he seems to have quickly gained prominence and became a successful businessman being involved in fish processing and pearl trading. In 1696 he led a national fund-raising campaign to buy back Scots captured by Barbary pirates. He was an author, writing on the trade between Scotland and England and became a supporter of the Darien Scheme. Spreul was elected as a burgess in seventeen Scottish towns in the late sevententh and early eighteen centuries. Early life Depiction of a conventicle in progress, from H. E. Marshall's Scotland's Story 1906 John's father, who was born in 1607, was Bailie John Spreull, merchant in Paisley. His father's family were descended from the Spreulls of Cowden. John's mother was Janet Alexander. She was the daughter of Bailie James Alexander, a Paisley merchant, and Janet Maxwell of Pollok. John was their second son. John first became an apothecary in Paisley and then later in Glasgow. An apothecary would sell herbs and drugs for medical uses. Jardine suggests he may have sold opium. He is also sometimes later called a merchant of Glasgow. Mr Spreul's troubles began very soon after the Pentland Rising. His father, John Spreul, merchant in Paisley, was fined by Middleton, although he had suffered for his refusing the tender; he paid the one half of his fine, and being prosecuted for the other, or rather his refusing the declaration, he was forced, with many other worthy persons, to abscond. When General Dalziel came to Kilmarnock in the year 1667, a party of soldiers were sent to Paisley, and took Mr Spreul prisoner, merely because he would not tell them where his father was. At that time, after many terrible threatenings of being shot to death, roasted at a fire, and the like, and some short confinement, he was dismissed. In the year 1677, he was, with Aikenhead and many other gentlemen, cited before a court in Glasgow. Finding that severity was designed against all that appeared in court, Mr Spreul absented, and was with several other persons denounced and intercommuned, though nothing was laid to their charge but mere nonconformity. This obliged him to quit his house and shop, and go abroad, sometimes to Holland, France and Ireland, and merchandise. He was in Ireland with his uncle Mr James Alexander in May 1679, and came over to Scotland after the scuffle at Drumclog in June, and went to his house at Crawford's Dyke, where understanding the conduct of the west country army, he had no freedom to join them, though his own brother James Spreul, and two cousins, John Spreul writer, and John Spreul merchant in Glasgow, were with them in arms. His business obliged him to be with some in that army, but he never joined them. After the defeat at Bothwell he absconded again, however his wife and family was turned out of his house and shop, and all the moveables secured. Within a little he retired to Holland, and stayed there some time. Imprisonment Boot Spreul returned from Holland in order to take his wife and children to Rotterdam. On 12 November 1680, he was apprehended by men looking for Donald Cargill, and being brought before the Council, was examined, and afterwards put to the torture before a Committee of their number. Not getting him to confess what they desired by torturing him in the new boot, they sent for the old one, and tortured him over again; and being equally unsuccessful with it, Dalziel alleged that the hangman favoured him; upon which the hangman said, he struck with all his might, and bade him take the mallet himself to do it better. On 2 March 1681, Spreul was indicted before the High Court of Justiciary on the charge of treason and rebellion, for alleged accession to the insurrection at Bothwell Bridge. The proof, however, failed, and a verdict of not proven was returned by the jury. Spreul's lawyer was Lockhart; those who did not recognise the courts generally did not employ lawyers. Upon this, instead of being liberated, he was still kept prisoner; and, on pretext of being present at field conventicles he was fined £500 sterling, and sent to the Bass, by an act of Privy Council, July 14, 1681. The order for transport is recorded as 16 August 1681. Here he continued for nearly six years. The act of Council for his liberation is dated 12 May 1687. He was the last prisoner who was released from the Bass. He survived the Revolution many years. Wodrow's trial account The killing of Archbishop Sharpe According to the council registers, Spreul was examined 13 November 1680, but his answers are not recorded there. Spreul's own account, as far as he could remember, was recorded by Wodrow. His examination is given below. Q: Were you at the killing of the archbishop? A: I was in Ireland at that time. Q: Was it a murder? A: I know not, but by hearsay, that he is dead, and cannot judge other men's actions upon hearsay. I am no judge, but in my discretive judgment I would not have done it, and cannot approve it. He was again urged-; but do you not think it was murder? Ans. Excuse me from going any further; I scruple to condemn what I cannot approve, seeing there may be a righteous judgment of God, where there is a sinful hand of man, and I may admire and adore the one when I tremble at the other. Q: Were you at Drumclog? A: I was at Dublin then. Q: Did you know nothing of the rebels rising in arms when in design? A: No; the first time I heard of it was in coming from Dublin to Belfast in my way home, where I heard that Claverhouse was resisted by the country people at Drumclog. Q: Was not that rebellion? A: I think not ; for I own the freedom of preaching the gospel, and I hear, what they did was only in self-defence. Q: Were you at Bothwell with the rebels? A: After my return from Ireland I was at Hamilton seeking in money, and clearing counts with my customers, so I went through part of the west country army, and spoke with some there, since the king's high-way was as free to me as to other men; but I neither joined them as commander, trooper, nor soldier. Q: Was that rising rebellion? A: I will not call it rebellion, I think it was a providential necessity put on them for their own safety, after Drumclog. This confession of his he was urged to subscribe, but absolutely refused it. Kirkton records that even in Dumfries, at the beginning of the Pentlands Rising, the insurgents drank the king's health and M'Crie, over about 8 pages, argues repeatedly that although they rose in arms, they were not rebels. He says those involved in the rising regarded it as \\"sinless self-defence\\" and they were wanting justice rather than seeking to overthrow the king or his government. Wodrow's account of the torture The Boots from Scots Worthies The Duke of York (later James VII) was the younger brother of Charles II. and later his heir before James was deposed to make way for William and Mary. James described Spreul as more dangerous than five hundred ordinary people. Wodrow records \\"Mr Spreul before the council, on November 15, confesseth he was in company with Mr Cargill in Edinburgh, but will not discover in what house, and adds, that there was nothing betwixt them but salutations.\\" Mr Spreul having come from Ireland in the time of Bothwell, and being just now come from Holland, and owning he had been in company with Mr Cargill, the managers were of opinion that he could give them more information: and now being got into the inhuman way of putting people to the torture, and A. Stuart being examined this way, November 15, that same day the council pass the following act. \\"The lords of his majesty's privy council having good reason to believe, that there is a principle of murdering his majesty, and those under him, for doing his majesty's service, and a design of subverting the government of church and state, entertained and carried on by the fanatics, and particularly by Mr Donald Cargill, Mr Robert Macwaird, and others their accomplices, and that John Spreul and Robert Hamilton have been in accession thereunto, ordain them to be subjected to the torture, upon such interogatories as relate to these three points: 1st. By what reason and means that murdering principle is taught and carried on; who were accessory to the contrivance of murdering; who were to be murdered; and also as to the archbishop of St Andrews's murder. 2nd. If there was any new rebellion intended; by what means it was to be carried on; who were to bring home the arms; if any be brought or bought, and by whom; who were the contrivers and promoters of the late rebellion at Bothwell-bridge. 3d. Who were their correspondents abroad and at home, particularly at London, or elsewhere; what they know of bringing home or dispersing seditious pamphlets, and such other particulars as relate to those generals. And give full power and commission to the earls of Argyle, Linlithgow, Perth, and Queensberry, treasurer-depute, register, advocate, justice-clerk, general Dalziel, Lord Collington, and Haddo, to call and examine the said persons in torture, upon the said interrogatories, and such other as they shall find pertinent upon the said heads, and report.\\" The Lord Haltoun was preses of this committee, and the Duke of York and many others were present. The preses told Mr Spreul, that if he would not make a more ample confession than he had done, and sign it, he behoved to underly the torture. Mr Spreul said, \\"He had been very ingenuous before the council, and would go no further; that they could not subject him to torture according to law; but if they would go on, he protested that his torture was without, yea, against all law; that what was extorted from him under the torture, against himself or any others, he would resile from it, and it ought not to militate against him or any others; and yet he declared his hopes, God would not leave him so far as to accuse himself or others under the extremity of pain.\\" Then the hang-man put his foot in the instrument called the boot, and, at every query put to him, gave live strokes or thereby upon the wedges. The queries were, whether he knew any thing of a plot to blow up the Abbay and duke of York? who was in the plot, and where Mr Cargill was, and if he would subscribe his confession before the council? To these he declared his absolute and utter ignorance, and adhered to his refusing to subscribe. When nothing could be expiscate by this, they ordered the old boot to be brought, alleging this new one used by the hangman was not so good as the old, and accordingly it was brought, and he underwent the torture a second time, and adhered to what he had before said. General Dalziel complained at the second torture, that the hangman did not strike strongly enough upon the wedges; he said he struck with all his strength, and offered the general the mall to do it himself. Mr Spreul was very firm, and wonderfully supported, to his own feeling in body and spirit, during the torture. When it was over, he was carried to prison on a soldier's back, where he was refused the benefit of a surgeon. Release order and Spreul's refusal In May 1687 an order is granted to liberate John Spreul. Favours were now shown to the prisoners; and after near seven years' imprisonment, Mr Spreul sent a petition to the council, which follows from the original. Robert Dick were sold to gifted into servitude or slavery in the newly established colonies in America or the West Indies. They travelled on ships such as the Carolina Merchant and the Henry & Francis The Covenanters' Memorial at Deerness Orkney where the Crown of London was shipwrecked on 10 December 1679 while transporting slaves from Leith before crossing the Atlantic. \\" Whereas it is not unknown to your lordships, how that your lordships' petitioner, after his first imprisonment, was put to the extremity of the torture two several times, the which having sustained, was thereby assoiled by the laws of this and all other nations. Thereafter, when he was indicted, he was also cleared by the verdict of the whole assize, and thereupon assoiled by the lords of the justiciary ; and at last being libelled before your lordships by his majesty's advocate, who could prove nothing against him, yet your lordships being pleased to fine him, and continue his imprisonment so long, because he had not freedom to depone upon the libel, the reasons wherefore he could not, being not only from grounds in law, but especially from conscience, and his obligation and respect to the gospel of Jesus Christ, which are at more length expressed in his information, together with a touch at a few of the great losses he hath sustained both before and since his imprisonment (what by sea, the great fire at Glasgow, house and shop taken from his wife in his absence, also by bad debtors, and through his imprisonment all is prescribed by law (that is due him) after three years past, the goods taken from him by major Johnston, and the death of his wife, and other great expenses since his imprisonment, (being these six years and five months) all which he humbly offereth to your lordships' consideration and pity. May it therefore please your lordships, to grant your lordships' petitioner liberty to follow his lawful calling in his native country, at least in any other nation where he may with best conveniency, not that he petitioneth for his own banishment, (and so to be sold as a slave, the which he would not be ashamed of, for the gospel's sake, if he be called of the Lord to it,) but the liberty of a freeborn subject is that he humbly begs, at least liberty a competent time to see if by law he can obtain any thing of his debtors to maintain himself in prison, seeing nothing hath been hitherto allowed him out of the goods taken from him by major Johnston, neither out of the treasury.\\" May 13 1687, the council grant the following- act of liberation. \\"The lords of his majesty's privy council, having considered an address made in behalf of John Spreul apothecary in Glasgow, now prisoner in the isle of the Bass, supplicating for liberty, in regard of his majesty's late gracious proclamation, do hereby give order and warrant to Charles Maitland, lieutenant-governor of the isle of the Bass, to set the said John Spreul at liberty, he having found caution acted in the books of council, to appear before the council once in June next, under the penalty of one thousand pounds Scots money, in case of failie. Extracted by me, Colin Mackenzie, Cl. Secr. Concilii.\\" When this order comes to the Bass, Mr Spreul was unwilling to take his liberty upon any terms that to him appeared inconsistent with the truths he was suffering for; and he apprehended this order involved him in an approbation of the proclamation specified, which he was far from approving. So much he signified to the governor of the Bass, and continued some time in prison, till a letter came over requiring the governor to set open doors to him, and tell him he was at liberty to go, or stay, as he pleased. Whereupon, after so long an imprisonment, he chose to come out under a protestation against what he took to be wrong in the orders and proclamation, and went over to Edinburgh, and waited on the counsellors, thanked them for allowing him liberty, and verbally renewed his protest against the proclamation and orders. Later life James Sproule relates that \\"Bass John was present as a witness when King William and Queen Mary received the instrument of government and consented to the Claim of Rights which he himself had helped to draw up.\\" He also relates that \\"in 1696 a campaign was launched to pay ransoms to free Scots held by the Barbary pirates of North Africa. John Spreull, merchant, headed a country-wide drive to collect money to pay said ransoms.\\" Later in life John Spreul was known for trade in pearls, especially Scottish pearls. A necklace made from his pearls was sold to Queen Anne. Spreul is also recorded as having a large fish processing operation where red herring was cured. This was at a site in Crawfurd's-dike on the east side of Greenock. John William Burns says in his preface that \\"Bass John took an active part in the politics of his day, and was one of the largest subscribers to the Darien Scheme\\", investing 1000 pounds. Alexander Shields, also a prisoner on the Bass, went as a preacher to Darien. Bass John in poetry After his release Bass John took as motto on his crest the words, \\"Sub pondere cresco\\" which translates as \\"under weight I grow\\" or \\"I thrive under burdens\\". Agnes H. Bowie wrote a poem called The Martyr's Crest which is about John Spreul. Works Miscellaneous writings with some papers relating to his history, ...

Rakesh under the banner of Universal cinemas. The film features Biju Menon, Asif Ali, and Baiju Santhosh in titular roles. The film was written by Dileep Ponnan, while music was composed by Emil Muhammed. Nikhila Vimal is the female lead and Sreenivasan also plays an important role. Plot The story revolves around the lives of three 'Shajis' from different places in Kerala, Shaji Sukumaran (Baiju) from Thiruvananthapuram, Shaji George (Asif Ali) from Kochi, and Shaji Usman (Biju Menon) from Kozhikode. Shaji Usman is a quotation goon who accepts risky operations for the sake of supporting his family. His strange modus operandi is to stab people in the rear. Once, he gets a quotation through Adv. Lawrence (Sreenivasan), to attack Dominic (Ganesh Kumar), a popular party leader at Cochin. Shaji George is a con man in Cochin, who happens to be the brother of Dominic. Simultaneously, Shaji Sukumaran who is a cab driver is on the way to Cochin with four young people. He notices that one of them, Neenu (Nikhila) is seen spending the entire journey alone behind the car, with a doomed face. It doesn't take long for driver Shaji to understand that she is in trouble. The goon Shaji arrives at Cochin, stabs Dominic and leaves before driver Shaji passes by and spots the injured Dominic. He immediately takes him to the hospital. Later, goon Shaji calls his informer and then removes his sim card and throws it off a bridge to destroy any possible evidence. It happens that the youngster Shaji and his sidekick Kuntheesan (Dharmajan) are drinking beneath the bridge, and the sim card falls right into Kuntheesan's glass. He puts it into his phone before youngster Shaji gets a call about his brother's incident. They rush to the hospital but Dominic who hates his brother due to his lazy attitude, asks him to stay away. Meanwhile, Kuntheesan gets a call from someone through the new sim card. When the caller asks for Shaji (the goon), the phone is handed over to the youngster Shaji on the account of their same name. The caller says that a reward of 5 lakhs would be given the next day and youngster Shaji who is drunk, says okay. The next day, as he is back to his senses, goes in search of the reward before finding out that the person who announced it is the one behind his brother's attack. As they trace the person, it happens to be the right hand man to Dominic, Sakav GK (Sadiq). After leaving the reward in a dustbin as per youngster Shaji's directions, GK drives away while he gets a call from goon Shaji. Only then does he understand the whole mix up. As the two go to the hospital, goon Shaji calls in the number and Kuntheesan attends it. As goon Shaji says he wants to hand over a quotation, Kuntheesan who thinks he too can get money as earlier, decides to repeat the incident. But he gets caught by goon Shaji. Kuntheesan is tied up by goon Shaji who wants his money back. Meanwhile, the driver Shaji is approached by Neenu who gives him a phone number. This number belongs to youngster Shaji and it is revealed that the two of them were in love with each other. A flashback shows how love blossoms between Neenu and her neighbour youngster Shaji. Neenu's father, who is clearly not interested in this relation, approaches Dominic who assures him to keep his brother away from her at any cost. Dominic hatches a cruel plan to send youngster Shaji to Nagercoil so that Neenu's father can marry her off to a suitable alliance. This saddens youngster Shaji. Neenu calls her long lost boyfriend to tell him how bad her life has been after the marriage. The guy, Jerome is a ruthless brat with friend circles with numerous unhealthy relationships. Youngster Shaji is angered at Jerome and his friends and beats them up. But he is also beaten, and when driver Shaji comes to stop them, he gets hit too. Driver Shaji feels sorry for youngster Shaji, and agrees to help him save Neenu. Meanwhile goon Shaji calls the traitor and the phone is attended by driver Shaji, leading to hilarious conversations. Jerome and his team leave for the seaport in a different cab the next day. The driver and youngster Shajis leave for the seaport but gets stuck in the traffic jam. Meanwhile, goon Shaji who is instructed by Lawrence to pack his things for leaving, also enters the same road. Jerome's vehicle also enters, in which a girl (Ranjini Haridas) starts an argument which disturbs the driver and ultimately causes the vehicle to crash onto a set of shops and create panic. Goon Shaji who sees this, drives his car at full speed towards the crashed vehicle before stopping it, and heroically gets out. It follows with a fight wherein goon Shaji beats Jerome and his friend black and blue, while Neenu escapes. Youngster Shaji arrives at the seaport and is saddened to see the cruise leaving. Later, all the three Shajis arrive at Lawrence's hotel room. Neenu and youngster Shaji reunite, and Lawrence ensures to take care of all legal issues. Goon Shaji's money is given to him. Neenu and youngster Shaji ride away happily and driver Shaji, after one more hilarious phone conversation with an unknown goon Shaji, happily drives back home. Before leaving home, goon Shaji pulls away his sim card and throws it down a bridge yet again. The sim card is found by two men who are drinking beneath the bridge. One of them (Hareesh Kanaran) inserts it in a mobile phone, and gets a call from someone asking for \\"Shaji\\". Upon hearing this, the other guy who is also named Shaji (Soubin Shahir), is astonished and answers the call, while the credits start appearing.

This image was generated by an artificial intelligence based on an analysis of portraits. StyleGAN is a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) introduced by Nvidia researchers in December 2018, and made source available in February 2019. StyleGAN depends on Nvidia's CUDA software, GPUs and TensorFlow.  History  In December 2018, Nvidia researchers distributed a preprint with accompanying software introducing StyleGAN, a GAN for producing an unlimited number of (often convincing) portraits of fake human faces. StyleGAN was able to run on Nvidia's commodity GPU processors. In February 2019, Uber engineer Phillip Wang used the software to create This Person Does Not Exist, which displayed a new face on each web page reload. Wang himself has expressed amazement, given that humans are evolved to specifically understand human faces, that nevertheless StyleGAN can competitively \\"pick apart all the relevant features (of human faces) and recompose them in a way that's coherent.\\" In September 2019, a website called Generated Photos published 100,000 images as a collection of stock photos. The collection was made using a private dataset shot in a controlled environment with similar light and angles. Similarly, two faculty at the University of Washington's Information School used StyleGAN to create Which Face is Real?, which challenged visitors to differentiate between a fake and a real face side-by-side. The faculty stated the intention was to \\"educate the public\\" about the existence of this technology so they could be wary of it, \\"just like eventually most people were made aware that you can Photoshop an image\\". The second version of StyleGAN, called StyleGAN2, is published on 5 February 2020. It removes some of the characteristic artifacts and improves the image quality.  Related issues  The technology has drawn comparison with deep fakes and its potential usage for sinister purposes has been bruited. In December 2019, Facebook took down a network of accounts with false identities, and mentioned that some of them had used profile pictures created with artificial intelligence.

The eldest of four children, Boonchai was brought into the family business by his father Suchin, who had built the business by partnering with Motorola. Boonchai was 27 when his father died in 1981, leaving him the business as well as a lot of debt amid numerous lawsuits.

It was executive produced by Akiva Goldsman, Geoff Johns, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Greg Walker, with Walker serving as showrunner. Created by Goldsman, Johns, and Berlanti, the series is based on the DC Comics team Teen Titans. Featured in the main cast are Brenton Thwaites, Anna Diop, Teagan Croft, and Ryan Potter. The season also introduces Alan Ritchson, Minka Kelly, Curran Walters, and Conor Leslie, who would join the main cast in the following season. The first season marks the live-action debut of the Teen Titans, as well as the launch of DC Universe's original scripted programming. In the first season, vigilante Dick Grayson (Thwaites) leaves Gotham City for Detroit in an effort to distance himself from his mentor Bruce Wayne. When the mysterious Rachel Roth (Croft) comes to Dick for protection from dangerous forces pursuing her, Dick finds himself thrust into action as he struggles to distance himself from his Robin persona and control his violent urges. Joined by Kory Anders (Diop), an amnesiac woman with solar- based powers, and Gar Logan, an animal shapeshifter, the four battle a threat that puts the entire world at risk. Development of a live-action series based on Teen Titans began in 2014 when the project was picked up by TNT. A pilot written by Goldsman and Marc Haimes was ordered, but was never filmed, and TNT passed on the project in 2016. The following year, Warner Bros. announced that the project would move forward in 2018 as the first scripted series for DC Universe. Initially planned to comprise 12 episodes, the original finale would be removed and the intended penultimate episode became the season finale. The season received generally positive reviews, with praise for the story, characters, and performances. Criticism was directed towards the violent tone and the finale's cliffhanger ending. The second season, which was announced ahead of the first season's premiere, would use the original finale as the basis for its premiere episode. In addition to being the first live-action adaptation of the Teen Titans, the season serves as the live-action introduction for the DC Comics team Doom Patrol, who appear in the self-titled fourth episode. The characters introduced would later be featured in an eponymous series on DC Universe, with April Bowlby, Matt Bomer, and Brendan Fraser reprising their roles as Rita Farr, Larry Trainor, and Cliff Steele, although it occupies a separate continuity from Titans.

Production =Development= Co-creator Geoff Johns previously wrote the Teen Titans comic relaunch in 2003 A potential live-action Titans project for cable channel TNT was announced in September 2014. By December 2014, a pilot written by Akiva Goldsman and Marc Haimes had been ordered that would feature Dick Grayson emerging from Batman's shadow to become Nightwing, the leader of a band of heroes including Starfire, Raven, Oracle, and Hawk and Dove. The pilot was set with filming to occur in Toronto in the mid-2015. In May 2015, TNT president Kevin Reilly said that they hoped to have the casting locked down by the start of filming and that the show would be \\"very true\\" to the comics and \\"groundbreaking\\". The series, called Titans and then Blackbirds, was first set to begin shooting in Toronto in mid-2015. Production was then postponed to October. In January 2016, it was announced that TNT would no longer be moving forward with the project. In February 2016, Geoff Johns stated \\"We [at DC] have known about [TNT nixing Titans] for months and months and months. That's not new news to us. We have plans for Titans. It's a huge piece of DC and we have plans.\\" In April 2017, Warner Bros. announced that Titans would debut in 2018 on DC Comics' own direct-to-consumer digital service. The series is being developed by Akiva Goldsman, Johns, Greg Berlanti, and Sarah Schechter, with Goldsman, Johns and Berlanti writing the pilot episode. Showrunner duties were given to Greg Walker. All are also executive producers of the series for Goldsman's Weed Road Pictures and Berlanti's Berlanti Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. Though twelve episodes were initially announced, the twelfth episode was ultimately pulled and the eleventh episode became the season 1 finale. The intended twelfth episode served as the baseline for the season 2 premiere. =Writing= Johns said the series was inspired mostly by the Teen Titans comics of the 1980s, since that comic's run \\"had so much drama\\" and \\"was so revolutionary for its time\\". He added, \\"We really wanted to lean into the idea that every Titan of these Titans is a doorway into another genre. With Rachel [a.k.a. Raven], it's the supernatural and the horror, and the first season really focuses on who Raven is and how the Titans galvanize around her.\\" Johns also felt the series would be \\"a little more adult\\" than the television series Riverdale, calling it \\"not necessarily a teen drama, [but] more of an adventure piece\\". He said that tonally, \\"We wanted to do something different from everything else out there. We wanted to arrive at a tone that wasn't as welcoming as some of the DC shows have been, nor as nihilistic as some of the films have been.\\" Goldsman said that as the series continues, it will ask \\"How are these broken people going to cohere? Or will they?\\" Johns noted that Robin's controversial \\"Fuck Batman\\" line in the pilot was a late addition to the script. Dick's actor Brenton Thwaites said of the line, \\"I thought it was perfect... This is not a show about Batman. It's a show about Dick.\\" =Casting= In early August 2017, Teagan Croft was cast as Rachel Roth, followed at the end of the month with the casting of Anna Diop as Kory Anders, and Brenton Thwaites as Dick Grayson. Ahead of the series premiere, Diop reduced her presence on social media because of racist attacks towards her casting. The main cast for the first season would be rounded out by Ryan Potter as Gar Logan, who was announced in October 2017. In early September 2017, Alan Ritchson and Minka Kelly were cast in the recurring roles of Hank Hall and Dawn Granger, respectively. By the end of the month, Lindsey Gort had been cast as original character Amy Rohrbach. In January 2018, Seamus Dever was cast in an undisclosed role that was later revealed to be Trigon. The following month, members of the Doom Patrol were announced with Bruno Bichir as the Chief, April Bowlby as Rita Farr, Jake Michaels as Cliff Steel, and Matt Bomer the voice of as Larry Trainor. In August, Elliot Knight was cast as Don Hall. Additionally, Curran Walters and Conor Leslie appear as Jason Todd and Donna Troy, respectively. =Filming= Filming for began on November 15, 2017, in Toronto, Ontario, and wrapped June 28, 2018.  Reception  Brad Anderson pictured) was mostly positive, the violent content drew criticism On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating of 80%, with an average rating of 6.66 out of 10 based on 45 reviews. The site's critical consensus states, \\"Despite a few tonal growing pains, Titans does justice to its source material and truly shines when its titular ensemble finally assembles.\\" Metacritic gave the series' first season a score of 55 out of 100 based on eight critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Susana Polo of Polygon praised Titans for \\"tempering brutal violence and dark subject matter with humor—and by giving its characters plenty of time to stretch, breathe and become attached to one another\\". Describing Anna Diop's performance of Kory Anders as the strongest aspect of the first three episodes, Charlie Ridgely of Comicbook.com wrote that \\"she conveys so much wonder and intrigue with her subtle and genuine expressions, but there is a consistent fierceness and tenacity that is always lurking just beneath the surface.\\" Rosie Knight of Nerdist wrote that the \\"cast is at the core of what makes Titans so enjoyable\\", while giving praise to the script as well. Forbes contributor Merrill Barr compared the show to The CW's Riverdale, describing it as \\"a dark and gritty series very far removed from the image the Teen Titans have garnered through a variety of animated outings over the last decade\\". Barr found that viewers \\"that take the tone in stride are going to find themselves in the middle of a series dialed directly into their interests\\". Rob Salkowitz of Forbes wrote that Titans \\"somehow managed to deliver on the dark-and-foreboding tone that the early DC movies so conspicuously got wrong\\". Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant was critical of the show's excessive violence, writing that Titans \\"doesn't put forward any new or particularly compelling thoughts about its characters or about superheroes in general\\". Similarly, Vinne Mancuso of Collider said, \\"If you're just a fan of some good old-fashioned ultra-violence and moody storytelling, this simply isn't a well-done example of that\\". Evening Standard reviewer Guy Pewsey stated that the series was \\"enjoyable and watchable\\" and although questioning if Brenton Thwaites could \\"pull off the role of leader of a group of crime-fighters\\" as Dick Grayson, called Diop's performance a \\"highlight\\" of Titans. The season finale \\"Dick Grayson\\", which was originally intended as the penultimate episode, drew criticism for its cliffhanger ending and not resolving the main storyline of the season. IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave the finale a 4/10, writing that after \\"Titans got off to a surprisingly good start this year, especially considering all the baggage the series was carrying when it first debuted\\", the episode \\"manages to derail that momentum and goodwill with a head-scratching and extremely unsatisfying final chapter\\". Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini called the episode's cliffhanger \\"anticlimactic and feels like a cheat\\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christian Holub said, \\"The journey to Nightwing is gonna take a lot longer than I thought. But I was really impressed by this season overall, and I'm excited for season 2\\".

Company History = Louis Brandt & Fils: The Precursor to Patria = A portrait of Louis Brandt. In 1848 the watchmaker Louis Brandt, who was just 23 years old at the time, opened a factory for the production of key wound pocket watches in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Following considerable success, he formed the company 'Louis Brandt & Fils' with his eldest son Louis Paul in 1877. Following Louis Brandt's death in 1879, his sons Louis Paul and César took over the family business, inspired by their father's passion for watchmaking. In the same year, they moved the company headquarters to Bienne where it is still located to this day. In 1885, the Brandt Brothers developed their first series-produced calibre, the \\"Labrador\\" which would give them commercial success and the means to register new brands and explore new markets. = Foundation of Patria = The original trademark publication for Patria in 1892 from Le Bureau Fédéral à Berne On October 10th 1892 Louis Brand & Fils, run by Louis Paul and César Brandt registered the name 'Patria' with the description, \\"Mouvements, boites, cadrans, ecrins et emballages de montres\\". Translated to English, this means \\"Movements, cases, dials, watch boxes and watch packaging. The name 'Patria' is from the latin word for \\"Fatherland\\" or \\"Homeland\\", cognate with Ancient Greek πατριά (patriá, “generation, ancestry, descent, tribe, family”) and πατρίς (patrís, “place of one's ancestors”). = The Wristwatch Emerges from War = The importance of wristwatches in battle had already been established following the First Boer War in 1880 and the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885. It wasn't until the Second Boer War in 1899 however, that watch companies including Patria began mass-producing purpose-built wristwatches for use in battle. The advantage of a wristwatch over a pocket watch was that the user only required one hand to operate it; a very valuable thing whilst holding a weapon. Prior to this change in cultural attitude, wristwatches were referred to as 'wristlets' and were normally only worn by women. = The First Patria Wristwatches = Patria Military Trench Watch from circa 1905 on leather bund strap At the beginning of the 20th Century, Patria began producing a wristwatch that would later be known as the Military Trench Watch. The Military Trench Watch featured a 36mm diameter case made from Sterling Silver or Nickel Silver and a white or black porcelain dial. It also featured large numerals filled with the radioactive substance, Radium; a material that glows under low light, providing visibility at all times. The watch featured a nickel-plated in-house 13 ligne calibre, engraved 'Patria Watch Co, Swiss'. = Wristwatches for Women = Patria manufactured ladies' watches in the early 1900s through to the 1930s, ranging from modest steel case construction to more extravagant silver and 18k gold pieces with decadent engravings and craftsmanship. = Patria in the Trenches = When the First World War broke out in 1914, a tactic known as the Creeping Artillery Barrage was frequently used. This involved artillery fire moving forward in stages just ahead of the advancing infantry and required perfect timing to avoid friendly fire. . As a result of this, 1/4 of all soldiers were wearing wristwatches by 1916. In 1917, the War Office began issuing wristwatches to all soldiers. A great number of the watches issued to the men fighting in the trenches were Patria Military Trench Watches.

The de facto ban was accordingly criticised as \\"fascist\\" (by noted actor Soumitra Chatterjee and actor-director Aparna Sen), \\"condemnable\\" (by director Srijit Mukherji), \\"extremely undemocratic\\" (by economist and London School of Economics Professor Maitreesh Ghatak), and as an \\"infringement on one’s fundamental right to view a film\\" (by an editorial in The Statesman (India)). Other scholars and commentators termed the de facto ban \\"clearly unconstitutional\\" and in violation of Indian Supreme Court precedents, and an example of \\"liberal hypocrisy\\" (considering the ostensibly left-liberal credentials of the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee). When asked about the incident, Banerjee told the press: \\"I will not answer. Don’t ask me this question.\\" Various processions and marches have been carried out to protest against the ban. A writ petition against the ban has been filed before the Calcutta High Court by film enthusiasts.

Purpose  A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\".  Extent  Jutten Island MPA is part of the West Coast National Park. The MPA is at the southern entrance to Saldanha Bay, 800 m from Jut Point. The area of the island is 46 ha and it is fairly flat with two small hills. The highest point is 60 m above sea level. The total area of the MPA is 1.11 km2 = Boundaries = The MPA is below the high water mark within the boundaries: *Northern boundary: S33°04.706′, E017°56.961′ to S33°04.706′, E017°57.861′ *Eastern boundary: S33°04.706′, E017°57.861′ to S33°05.306′, E017°57.861′ *Southern boundary: S33°05.306′, E017°57.861′ to S33°05.306′, E017°56.961′ *Western boundary: S33°05.306′, E017°56.961′ to S33°04.706′, E017°56.961′ = Zonation =  Restricted areas   Controlled areas   Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, SANParks, which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Geography  = Climate = The climate of the South-western Cape is markedly different from the rest of South Africa, which is a summer rainfall region, receiving most of its rainfall during the summer months of December to February. The South-western Cape has a Mediterranean type climate, with most of its rainfall during the winter months from June to September. During the summer the dominant factor determining the weather in the region is a high pressure zone, known as the South Atlantic High, located over the South Atlantic ocean to the west of the Cape coast. Winds circulating in an anticlockwise direction from such a system reach the Cape from the south-east, producing periods of up to several days of high winds and mostly clear skies. These winds keep the region relatively cool. Because of its south facing aspect Betty's Bay is exposed to these winds. Winter in the South-western Cape is characterised by disturbances in the circumpolar westerly winds, resulting in a series of eastward moving depressions. These bring cool cloudy weather and rain from the north west. The south westerly winds over the South Atlantic produce the prevailing south- westerly swell typical of the winter months, which beat on the exposed coastline. = Seasonal variations in sea conditions =  Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Jutten Island Marine Protected Area is in the Benguela ecoregion The MPA is in the cool temperate Benguela ecoregion to the west of Cape Point which extends northwards to the Orange River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. = Marine species diversity =  Animals  Birds - breeding colonies of: *African oystercatcher *Kelp gull *Chroicocephalus hartlaubii (Hartlaub's gull) *Swift tern *Crowned cormorant *Cape cormorant *Bank cormorant  Seaweeds   Endemism  The MPA is in the cool temperate Benguela ecoregion to the west of Cape Point which extends northwards to the Orange River.

The occupation of Saint - Nizier church by Lyon prostitutes refers to the ten-day occupation of the Saint-Nizier Church in Lyon by more than a hundred prostitutes on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions. The occupation lasted eight days until the women were removed by the police on 10 June. Sympathetic occupations of churches by prostitutes followed in Paris, Marseille, Grenoble, Saint-Étienne and Montpellier.  Background  In the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. In April 1975, the Lyon prostitutes started to organise themselves and their leader, \\"Ulla\\" appeared on television to publicise the women's demands. After three murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, sex workers in Lyon took action. Occupation On 2 June 1975 more than 100 prostitutes occupied the Saint- Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. They demanded the end of fines, police harassment and the release from jail of ten of them who had been imprison a few days earlier for soliciting. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma. The occupation made national headlines and was reported internationally. Local people supported the woman and brought clothes and food. The occupation received support from political, union and feminist organisations. Abolitionists, in the form of the Movement du Nid, also supported the occupation, hoping the public awareness it raised would help end prostitution. The parish priest, the Rev. Antonin Bdal, refused to call the police to remove the women. However, acting on Government orders, the police forcibly cleared the church after eight days on 10 June. The Minister of the Interior, Michel Poniatowski, claimed the women had been manipulated into the occupation by pimps, and the Women rights Minister, Françoise Giroud, refused to meet with the women and claimed she was not competent in the matter. The leader of the Movement, \\"Ulla\\", had her real name and photograph printed in the press. The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for sex workers' rights. Legacy The occupation is remembered every year on 2 June as International Whores' Day. A journalist working for Libération, Claude Jaget, followed the occupation. In addition to his articles in Libération, he later published a book: Une vie de putain. This book gathers six testimonies, from among the prostitutes who participated in the occupation of the church. In 2016, a play, Loveless, written by Anne Buffet and Yann Dacosta, an adaptation of the book, Une vie de putain, was enacted at the National Dramatic Center of Normandy-Rouen it was also staged in Lyon at the Théâtre des Célestins in 2018.

A member of the International Red Aid's Ceuta branch and Partido Comunista de España, she supported striking port workers and fish factory workers by hosting meetings in her home and providing food to striking workers. Pérez was imprisoned on 14 August 1936 around the time of the coup d'état of 1936. One of five Ceuta women to be sentenced to death by Francoist forces, her sentence was later changed to twelve years in prison of which she served eight, before being released from prison in Madrid. Pérez was one of the few prisoners to share stories of sexual violence in Ceuta's Francoist prison. She also witnessed the death of Antonia Céspedes Gallego. The Unión General de Trabajadores unanimously gave its \\"La Latera\\" award posthumously to her in 2017 in recognition of her fight for equality for women. Pérez was married to Antonio Berrocal, having six children with him. Berrocal, a communist city councilor in Ceuta, was killed by a mob of falangists in 1937. Pérez worked as a restaurateur, grocer and midwife.  Activism and death by Francoism  Prison de Partido de Ceuta confirms Antonia Pérez Padín is at the prison under the order of the Delegado del. Senor Comandante Militar on 14 August 1936. Her father was a teacher. Ideologically, her father was an anarchist. He shared these ideas with Pérez when she was young, instilling her with the value of fighting social injustices. Pérez was politically engaged as an adult. She was keen to address social injustices. Because of her desire to help the poor and repressed people, she joined International Red Aid's Ceuta branch and was also a member of Partido Comunista de España. As an activist, Pérez supported striking port workers in Ceuta, providing strikers with food. She also hosted meetings of striking port workers in her home. She was also involved in other campaigns for needy in the city. One involved workers at a fish factory in the city. She also fought to support women's rights and equal pay. During the Spanish Civil War, she spent some time in Rabat where she witnessed atrocities committed by Falange Pelegrina. This included shelling of civilians. Pérez was imprisoned on 14 August 1936 at the Sarcel Women's Prison. The arrest came around the time of the coup d'état of 1936. She never saw her husband again following her arrest. At the time of her arrest in 1936, her children ranged in age from two to ten years of age. Some went to stay with family, thought two went to an asylum. Perez was imprisoned with many other feminist women who supported the Spanish Second Republic. She was then transferred to the García Aldave prison around July 1937. After several months in prison, Pérez was finally sentenced to death at the age of 39 in Ceuta on 17 November 1937. She received two death sentences. The first was for belonging to International Red Aid's Ceuta branch. The second was for belonging to the Communist Party. Her death sentence was in part because supporting these two organizations was seen as part of a wider imminent plot by communities to create a foreign, Soviet influenced revolution in Spain. She was sentenced along with two other women, Andrea Maese Vázquez and Francisca Gutiérrez Hernández, for the same reasons. Joaquina Garriga Mosquecho and Ana Sánchez González were two of the other five total women in Ceuta to receive death sentences that year. They were the only five women in Ceuta to be given death sentences by Nationalist forces in the period between 1936 and 1942. The death sentences were handed down without the benefit of a trial. Her death sentence was later commuted to 12 years in prison. She would spend the next eight years with time spread out between several prisons, including Cárcel de Mujeres del Sarchal in Ceuta, in Cádiz, in Burgos, and in Madrid. She was in the Madrid prison in 1945. In November 1945, a judge announced her release from the Madrid jail. Pérez was never pardoned by the Spanish State. :Es:Penal de El Puerto de Santa María :Es:Penal de El Dueso :Es:Cárcel de mujeres de Ventas Pérez is one of the few women to have verified stories of sexual violence at Cárcel de Mujeres del Sarchal through her oral history. While in prison, she witnessed a well-known local Falangist seeking sexual favors from another female prisoner, Antonia Céspedes Gallego. On 21 January 21, 1937, the Falangist appeared and took Céspedes from her cell, telling other prisoners \\"You are reds and one day I will come for some of you.\\" While removing Céspedes from prison, the Falangist stabbed her in the back. A short time later, Pérez heard a gunshot outside the person. As Céspedes was being stabbed, she turned and screamed out to Pérez for help. When later talking about her time in prison with her children and grandchildren, Pérez described them as hotels. She later shared these experiences with her granddaughter. She made her time in prison sound like she was a world traveler. The Unión General de Trabajadores unanimously gave its \\"La Latera\\" award posthumously to her in 2017, with her son Manuel Berrocal collecting it on her behalf. The decision to award her the prize was based on a commitment to not forgetting historical memory. The award itself is given every two years specifically to remember women who fought for social justice, women's rights and equality in Spain, so they would not be forgotten.  Background  Pérez was born in Ceuta. Her mother was named Jacinta. Pérez inherited her strong character from her. Pérez was married to Antonio Berrocal. She had six children with him, only five of them survived. Her first child was a girl. Her husband was a member of the Communist Party of Spain, and was elected as a Ceuta city councilor in the elections of 12 April 1931. Berrocal was shot on his own farm along with 32 other people on 21 January 1937 after having been dragged there by a mob of falangists. He was one of eight councilors from the eleven member government who would be shot by Nationalist forces. Her children survived the Civil War, and Pérez eventually had a granddaughter named Gloria Berrocal. Berrocal has written several books about her grandmother's experiences during the Civil War. One of her sons was Manuel Berrocal, a historian. Because of the time his mother spent in prison, Manuel did not get to know her until he was a 10-year-old. Pérez lived in the Las Latas neighborhood of Ceuta. She ran a small restaurant near in the La Puntilla area in Ceuta. She later ran a small grocery store in Ceuta. She also worked as a midwife. In her later years, Pérez always dressed in black. Her legs were frequently swollen and she had varicose veins. In life after prison with her family, she listened to Radio Nacional de España, and would frequently sigh when listening to the news portion. In her later years, when she watched television and heard commentators say there were no political prisoners in Spain, she would throw a shoe at the television.

He was sentenced to death and executed in 1988.  Biography  Mikhail Makarov was born on March 12, 1962 in Leningrad to a working-class family. He graduated from 8th grade of secondary school, after which he entered a vocational school and became a member of the Komsomol. After serving in the military after college, he returned to Leningrad and got a job as a travelling fitter at Lengidroenergospetsstroy. Makarov soon married, but his family life was unsuccessful. He lived with his wife's relatives, who constantly reproached him for his inability to get a single apartment from the management of the company he worked at, calling him a \\"parasite\\" and a \\"loser\\".. In his spare time, the future killer was fond of reading detective literature and watching movies on the topic. According to him, he \\"wanted to experience the same feeling as criminals, murderers and rapists.\\" Makarov often fantasized about how he would kill his wife's parents, but he realized that in this case he would become the first suspect and did not risk putting his fantasies to life. Makarov explained his intention to start a criminal life with a desire to \\"get money to buy a cooperative apartment\\". = Crimes = In February 1986, Makarov attacked a 10-year-old schoolboy. The offender entered the apartment under the pretext of writing a note to the neighbors, struck the child many times with a screwdriver in the chest and head, and then, having searched the apartment, took all the money and seemingly valuable items. The boy pretended to be dead in order to save his life, but because of his injuries, he remained disabled forever. Before leaving, Makarov put out a cigarette on the victim's body, but the boy, in spite of the severe pain, did not even stir, as a result of which Makarov thought he was dead and quietly left the crime scene. The first murder he committed was on April 7, 1986, killing an 11-year-old named Dasha. He raped her and struck her at least 30 times with a sharpened screwdriver, after which he robbed the apartment, stealing money, jewelry and various valuable and low-value things, including children's toys. The next murder was that of a pensioner – a WWII veteran who served during the Siege of Leningrad. She went to the garbage disposal while Makarov was in the stairwell, searching for another apartment to burgle. The woman, having seen the unfamiliar man, reproached him - \\"everyone goes here\\". Because of this, the insulted Makarov dragged her into an apartment and struck the woman 51 times with a screwdriver, but did not rob the place, since, according to him, \\"there was nothing to profit from\\". Just a few weeks later, Makarov killed a 5-year-old girl named Masha. This time, wanting to lead the investigators astray, he decided to pretend that he the killer was an insane man. In order to do so, he trashed the apartment and smeared shilajit on the walls. In addition to money, jewelry and low-value items, the book \\"A Thousand and One Nights\\" from the publishing house \\"Irfon\\" in Dushanbe was stolen from the apartment. However, Makarov made a major mistake. Usually tracking down children on the street, this time he began walking around the apartments in search of a suitable victim. He broke into an apartment under the guise of being an employee of a children's library, but he saw the boy's mother open the door for him and immediately fled. The woman managed to remember the suspicious man well, and soon the police already had a facial composite of the suspect.  Arrest, trial and execution  Makarov decided to take the stolen book to a second-hand bookstore that advertised in a newspaper that they were buying rare editions of books. The seller noticed blood on one of the pages, and after Makarov left, the man called police. Using the shop's documents, the authorities identified the person who had brought the book. On the same day, he was detained near his apartment while returning from the grocery store. After his capture, he immediately confessed to his crimes – three murders and one attempted murder. He also showed a basement on the outskirts of Leningrad, in which police officers found a cache with part of the loot. The other part, in his own words, Makarov had sold to passers-by or friends. Some of the things stolen at the crime scene were presented to his wife's parents, after which they lagged behind him for some time with reproaches. On November 27, 1987, Makarov was sentenced to death by firing squad. He soon wrote a petition for a pardon, in which he asked to be sent to Afghanistan in order to \\"atone for the blood\\". The petition was rejected, and in 1988 he was executed.

Background James Bickham was born in Evercreech, Somerset, the son of James Bickham. He was educated at Sherborne, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge where he obtained a BA in 1741, a Fellowship in 1743, MA in 1744, BD in 1751 and DD in 1774. Ecclesiastical career Bickham was admitted to the diaconate by Richard Reynolds, Bishop of Lincoln, at Lincoln Cathedral in 1744, and admitted to priesthood by Thomas Gooch, Bishop of Norwich, in Norwich Cathedral in 1745. He was presented the rectory of Loughborough by his college in 1761, the benefice income of which had been trebled by enclosure awards. In 1772 Bickham was collated to the archdeaconry by his diocesan John Green, becoming the fifteenth Archdeacon of Leicester. As an archdeacon in the third largest of the six archdeaconries in the vast Lincoln diocese, Dr Bickham played an important role in preserving the fabric of its churches and church buildings. In 18th century England there was considerable concern about the steady decay of church buildings, with ecclesiastical figures such as Bishop Fleetwood and Archbishop Secker predicting that unless more was done to maintain the fabric of churches and the houses of clergy, England would lose many of them in the ensuing century. With the responsibility for the maintenance of churches fell in large part upon parishioners, and of the parsonages on the residing clergy, it was not always easy to persuade those with small incomes to undertake the necessary repairs.W.A. Pemberton, The Parochial Visitation of James Bickham D. Archdeacon of Leicester in the Years 1773 to 1779, 1985. By the 18th century the once powerful archdeacons' courts had been eclipsed, and so whether any action was taken to preserve church buildings depended in large part upon the personal interest and ability of individual archdeacons. Dr Bickham responded enthusiastically to the challenge, and between 1773 and 1779 undertook a great many personal inspections, including 123 parsonage houses, and encouraged clergy and parishioners to undertake necessary remedial work. By great chance, the records of his personal visitations are preserved in the Leicester archdeaconry and today form an important historical source.W.A. Pemberton, The Parochial Visitation of James Bickham D. Archdeacon of Leicester in the Years 1773 to 1779, 1985.

It became the largest solar facility in the state when it came online in late 2016. The electricity is being sold to Public Service of Colorado, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA). Xcel determined through an open bid process that the PPA's terms were competitive with natural gas. Construction details The project occupies a total of about 900 acres split into two parcels that are adjacent to the coal-fired Comanche Generating Station; thus providing access to existing high-capacity substation and transmission infrastructure. It uses 502,056 Trina Solar polycrystalline silicon panels that are mounted in rows and onto single-axis trackers. The rows are organized into 75 blocks, and the electricity produced from each block is connected to the electric grid through an inverter built by TMEIC. In early 2015, SunEdison awarded an EPC contract for the project to Renewable Energy Systems (RES) of Broomfield. Work at the site began in August and proceeded through the winter months, with most balance of system (BOS) construction activities completed by April 2016. The panel installation, electrical integration, and acceptance testing proceeded through the summer, enabling the start of commercial operations in September. The completed facility is operated and maintained by Swinerton Renewable Energy. Development and ownership history The project was originated by Community Energy, which completed many of the initial negotiations such as the grid integration strategy, land leases, and required permits. SunEdison announced its acquisition of the project in July 2014 concurrent with the results of Xcel's open solicitation/competitive bid process. In August, SunEdison announced its strategy to finance the $253 million Comanche project using a novel special purpose vehicle named \\"First Reserve\\". As designed with its partner Everstream Capital Management, this funding mechanism - a special type of warehouse - would expand to meet demand from new investors as Comanche (and future projects) moved into construction, thus reducing the need for incremental equity contributions by SunEdison while preserving a first right of call provision for its TerraForm Power yield co. With all requirements in place, the start of construction was announced in August 2015. Most BOS work was complete by the time that SunEdison filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016. Nevertheless, work at Comanche and other SunEdison projects continued unabated due to the company's receipt of $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing. On May 16, 2017 Novatus Energy announced its purchase of the operating Comanche facility, although terms were not disclosed.

It is a remake of the 1983 film of the same name and stars Jessica Rothe, Josh Whitehouse, Mae Whitman, and Judy Greer. The film follows Julie Richman, a Valley girl, who falls in love with Randy, a rebellious punk, during the early 1980s. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer first announced a musical remake in February 2012, but it was halted until November 2016 when Goldenberg joined the project as director and Rothe was cast in the lead role. Casting announcements continued until May 2017 and principal photography began that same month, taking place in Los Angeles. Following the completion of filming, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer scheduled the film for release on June 29, 2018. However, the film was delayed following controversies surrounding Logan Paul, who portrayed Mickey. Valley Girl was released simultaneously through video on demand and in select drive-in theaters on May 8, 2020, by United Artists Releasing. It was initially set to receive a wide theatrical release on the same date, but these plans were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the soundtrack, acting, and tone, though many deemed it to be inferior to the original film. Plot In present day, Ruby Richman arrives home, upset about breaking up with her boyfriend that night over her plans to participate in a study program in Japan. Her mother, Julie, sits her down and recounts to Ruby her own final semester of high school. In the early 1980s, as a teenager, Julie is a Valley girl who lives in Encino, Los Angeles, frequents shopping malls with her friends, Stacey, Karen and Loryn and dates Mickey, a popular but arrogant jock. However, she begins to feel disillusioned to her lifestyle and has second thoughts regarding her future with Mickey. She also aspires to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, rather than Cal State Northridge, as her parents and friends expect. At the beach, she comes across Randy, a Hollywood punk and lead singer of the band Safety Recall. The two flirt briefly before she abruptly leaves. That night, Julie and her friends attend a costume party at Mickey's house. Randy and his bandmates, Sticky and Jack, arrive at the venue, but are promptly thrown out. Later, Randy insists Julie leaves the party with him. Accompanied by a reluctant Stacey, Julie joins Randy and his friends to attend the band's performance at a punk nightclub. After Stacey leaves and Safety Recall perform, Julie spends the rest of the night with Randy, culminating with the two sharing a kiss. The next morning, Julie breaks up with Mickey, which frustrates her friends. She begins spending more time with Randy and changes her fashion style, while Karen begins dating Mickey. This causes further conflict between her and her friends, while the same rift occurs between Randy and his bandmates. One day, Julie invites Randy over for dinner on behest of her parents Diana and Steve. However, he overhears them talk about his lack of discipline and leaves. Later, at Stacey's birthday party, Mickey begins to antagonize Randy, resulting in the two getting into a physical fight that gets Randy thrown out. Stacey also gets upset at Julie for bringing him and forces her to leave too. Outside, Julie breaks up with Randy after the two argue over their clashing backgrounds and her friends' attitudes toward him. Later, Julie reluctantly agrees to be Mickey's date to the prom, who has broken up with Karen. She apologizes to Stacey, who forgives her and reveals she has been accepted to Dartmouth College. Meanwhile, Randy makes amends with his bandmates and decide to leave for New York before encouraging him to go after Julie. At the mall, Mickey reveals that Karen was not accepted to Northridge, unlike Loryn. On the night of the prom, Julie and Mickey are crowned prom king and queen. As the two dance, Julie breaks up with Mickey and begins to leave. Safety Recall arrive for a surprise performance, however, Mickey and his friends sabotage the equipment. Despite this, Julie and Randy share a duet and reunite. Later, Julie reconciles with Karen and Loryn is contacted to be a background dancer in an upcoming music video. As their friends dance, Julie and Randy leave the venue in Mickey's rented limousine. In present day, Julie reveals that Safety Recall signed a record deal in New York as she was finishing her degree at FIT and joined them on their first tour before eventually breaking up with Randy. She tells Ruby that while she did not end up with Randy, she enjoyed their time together and is happy with the life that she chose. In the end, text appears on screen, revealing everyone's future successes, except for Mickey who received a restraining order from the producers of The Bachelor for repeatedly sending them his audition tape. Cast Production In February 2012, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures announced a musical remake of 1983 film Valley Girl with Clay Weiner directing. In November 2016, Rachel Lee Goldenberg joined the project as director, with Clay Weiner and Paramount Pictures dropping out of the project which will be distributed through United Artists Releasing.

A Berkshire representative side played the county's first competitive game in 1932 against Sussex but had to wait until January 1947 for the RFU to admit them to the County Championship, making their debut in the 1948 competition, where they reached the quarter- finals. In 1948 the Berkshire Society of Rugby Football Referees was formed by referees that lived locally, having previously belonged to the London Society, who had up until then also overseen games involving Berkshire clubs. With the introduction of rugby union leagues in 1987, despite their closeness to London the majority of Berkshire clubs were placed in the south-west regional leagues, and up until the end of the century were grouped with Dorset and Wiltshire sides in a 3 tier Berks, Dorset & Wilts league. In 1994 Dennis Easby (D H Easby) became the first ever member of the Berkshire RFU to be elected as the president of the national RFU.

As a difficult teenager, he was known to police, as he engaged in petty theft, also torturing and killing domestic animals. He also showed heightened sexual interest and cruelty towards girls. Storozhenko was convicted twice, among his charges allegedly including rape. After his second release, he began work as a chauffeur at a car park. He married, and a son was born. Storozhenko had a reputation as an exemplary family man, and was characterized as a positive employee at work. Between 1978 and 1981, there were about 20 attacks on women and girls in Smolensk and its environs, 13 of which resulted in murder involving rape. He committed the first murder in the historic part of the city, not far from the Assumption Cathedral. Storozhenko was a not a strangler in the literal sense of the word, as he sadistically tortured and finished off victims in various ways; one of his victims of the murderer was a 12-year-old student of the 31st Smolensk Secondary School, whose body was found in a sand pit with signs of torture. Once, the killer attacked a woman who turned out to be a decoy, a law enforcement officer, but Storozhenko was then frightened off by one of the policemen in the ambush.Охотники за монстрами During the fight, he left traces of blood, as a result of which the criminal's blood type was established. It is also noteworthy that Storozhenko himself was a police informant and participated in the searches for the strangler. Four innocent people were arrested for Storozhenko's crimes: the first was an employee of the prosecutor's office, and before his innocence was proven, he spent 9 months in jail, after his release he had to resign from the prosecutor's office and leave the city; as an accomplice of the previous one, a traffic policeman was arrested; in the murder of a woman in the recreation area of the Smolensk Aviation Plant, the authorities accused a local guard who had previously been convicted of collaborationism during the Second World War, who, under the pressure of investigators, incriminated himself; and the final being a person caught for stealing, and under the threat of execution, was forced to confess to killing his wife and sentenced to 9 years imprisonment. Storozhenko was arrested in 1981: the last victim survived and remembered a tattoo on his chest, and then identified him from the presented photo. Storozhenko was then questioned about his carpool travel sheets - their data matched up with the time and place of the crime. His blood type also coincided with the one found under the nails of the murdered women. Storozhenko's wife admitted that he had given her gold earrings that belonged to one of the victims. A gold ingot was found hidden in his apartment, under the bed of his paralyzed mother. Vladimir's brother, Sergei, admitted that he knew about what his brother was doing, and said that the ingot is the melted decoration of his victims. He then indicated where other things were hidden. In addition, during the search, a cache of pistols and explosives were found: Sergei confessed that he and his brother had planned a series of attacks on state-owned enterprises on the days when they would issue wages there. When the last victim identified him a police line-up, Vladimir Storozhenko began to confess. During the course of the investigation, an experiment was conducted: out of 30 female dummies, 13 had the clothes of his victims, in whose pockets were notes with the name of the victim, the time and place of the body's discovery. He managed to accurately indicated the clothing of his victims. The investigation into the Storozhenko case was conducted by the famous investigator Issa Kostoyev, who later led the Chikatilo case. In 1983, the court upheld the death sentence by firing squad for Storozhenko, after which he was executed the following year. Sergei Storozhenko was convicted of criminal conspiracy and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. While serving his sentence, he unsuccessfully tried to escape, and another 3 years were added to his sentence. = In the media = Documentary film from the series The Investigation Led — Loop * Documentary film from the series Legends of the Soviet Investigation — Devil's Puzzle See also List of Russian serial killers References External links Smolensky Strangler Vladimir Storozhenko * Issa Kostoyev: Russia is the underworld.

Critics agreed that the pitching and batting controls, while obviously derived from golf video games, are innovative and add a new depth of control to the baseball genre. However, they lambasted the graphics and animation, often describing them as reminiscent of the 16-bit era. Next Generation concluded that \\"Grand Slam has all the features and options in place, but ultimately can't make up for substandard graphics and slow pace.\\" Other reactions to the selection of features and options were mixed; GameSpot and GamePro both found that though they were generally ample, the absence of create-a-player and team licenses stood out, since most of the game's competitors included these features. GameSpot nonetheless judged that \\"It may not have the team licenses, fifty years worth of statistics, or incredible graphics, but it is indeed fun (and it does have real MLB players).

Lynch (born 1947, Ennis, County Clare, Ireland), was ordained in 1971, is a Roman Catholic priest and psychotherapist, based in the United States, renowned for his human rights work with HIV/AIDS and with the LGBTQIA community. Work Lynch is an \\"out\\" gay Irish-born Roman Catholic priest, author, and activist who has worked for the rights of LGBT people for more than forty years starting with his work in Dignity USA (New York Chapter), the LGBT Catholic group, in the 1970s. In 1982, Lynch founded the first AIDS ministry in New York City with Dignity USA (New York Chapter) as documented in the documentary films AIDS: A PRIEST’S TESTAMENT in 1987 and SOUL SURVIVOR in 1990. Lynch publicly campaigned in support of Mayor Ed Koch's Executive Order 50 in 1984, which compels City contractors not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Lynch publicly testified in favour of New York City’s lesbian and gay rights bill that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation in jobs and public accommodations, seeing it through to passage by the New York City Council in 1986. Lynch’s support for LGBT rights brought down on him a false prosecution perpetrated by church and government officials. Lynch won total exoneration from Justice Burton Roberts in Bronx Supreme Court, as documented in the documentary film A PRIEST ON TRIAL in 1990. Lynch's television/radio appearances include the BBC’s interview show HARDtalk in 2013. He was honoured with the Magnus Hirschfeld Award 1988 for outstanding service to the cause of Irish LGBT civil rights. In 2006, Lynch became the first Catholic priest in the world to have a civil partnership. Lynch married his partner, Billy Desmond, in 2017 in Ireland. Lynch received Presidential Distinguished Service Awards for the Irish Abroad for 2019, in the Charitable Works category.

Although his scholarship has focused primarily on 19th-century British secularism, contemporary secularism, and the 19th-century freethought movement, he may be best known as a critic of the contemporary social justice movement and its effects in the academy, as he describes in his memoir, Springtime for Snowflakes: Social Justice and Its Postmodern Parentage, published in 2018. Early life and education Rectenwald's 2018 memoir records that he was the seventh of nine children born.Springtime for Snowflakes, (Nashville, TN: New English Review Press), 31 He grew up in a Catholic German-American family on the north side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A graduate of North Catholic High School in 1977, Rectenwald's undergraduate studies in English included a close apprenticeship with Beat Generation poet Allen Ginsberg at Naropa University (formerly Naropa Institute) during the 1979–80 school year. He graduated cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh in 1983 with a B.A. in English literature. In 1997, Case Western Reserve University awarded Rectenwald a master's degree in English literature. In 2004, Carnegie Mellon University conferred upon Rectenwald a Ph.D. in literary and cultural studies. He was recognized by Carnegie Mellon as among its top- performing graduates, when in the span of one year, he published three books. Academic career Rectenwald has taught at universities since 1993, including at Case Western Reserve University, Carnegie Mellon University, Duke University, North Carolina Central University, and New York University, where he was a Professor of Liberal and Global Liberal Studies for more than ten years before retiring in January 2019. Rectenwald has authored numerous articles for popular magazines and scholarly journals, as well as nine books, including Google Archipelago: The Digital Gulag and the Simulation of Freedom (New English Review Press, September 30, 2019), Springtime for Snowflakes: “Social Justice” and Its Postmodern Parentage (New English Review Press, 2018), Nineteenth-Century British Secularism: Science, Religion and Literature (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), Academic Writing, Real World Topics (Broadview Press, 2015), and Global Secularisms in A Post-Secular Age (De Gruyter, 2015). His academic essays have appeared in The British Journal for the History of Science', Endeavour, and the Cambridge University Press anthology George Eliot In Context, among others. =Research contributions= Rectenwald has written extensively on the origins of the movement called secularism, which was founded in London in 1851 by George Jacob Holyoake.Holyoake, G.J. (1896). English Secularism: A Confession of Belief. Library of Alexandria. pp. 47−48. . . Rectenwald's research has established that secularism was a significant cultural and philosophical source for agnosticism, and for the emerging new creed of \\"scientific naturalism” propounded by Thomas Henry Huxley, John Tyndall, Herbert Spencer, and others. Scientific naturalism is noteworthy for being the philosophical basis of \\"the Darwinian circle,\\" i.e., the 19th century scientists of note most responsible for the general acceptance of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution via natural selection.Stanley, Matthew. (2015) Huxley’s Church and Maxwell’s Demon: From Theistic Science to Naturalistic Science (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press); Lightman, Bernard V. and M. S. Reidy (eds.). The Age of Scientific Naturalism; and G. Dawson (eds) (2014) Victorian Scientific Naturalism: Community, Identity, Continuity (Chicago; London: The University of Chicago Press). Rectenwald argues in \\"Secularism and the cultures of nineteenth-century scientific naturalism,\\" published in The British Journal for the History of Science in June 2013: \\"Not only did early Secularism help clear the way by fighting battles with the state and religious interlocutors, but it also served as a source for what Huxley, almost twenty years later, termed 'agnosticism'...In Holyoake's Secularism we find the beginnings of the mutation of radical infidelity into the respectability necessary for the acceptance of scientific naturalism, and also the distancing of later forms of infidelity incompatible with it. Holyoake's Secularism represents an important early stage of scientific naturalism.\\" In his book, Nineteenth-Century British Secularism: Science, Religion and Literature, Rectenwald applies the conception of secularity as developed by philosopher Charles Taylor in A Secular Age (2007) to 19th-century Great Britain. The book is interdisciplinary, with chapters treating the secular antipodes Richard Carlile and Thomas Carlyle, the geology of Charles Lyell, the significance of George Jacob Holyoake's secularism, the emergence of scientific naturalism, the religiosity and secularity of the Newman brothers (John Henry Newman, Francis William Newman and Charles Robert Newman) and the postsecularism of the novel Daniel Deronda by George Eliot. In Holyoake's Secularism, Rectenwald locates a precursor for Charles Taylor’s version of secularity as the immanent frame that structures the conditions of belief and unbelief in modernity.Rectenwald, Michael. (2016). Nineteenth- Century British Secularism: Science, Religion and Literature. Houndsmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK; New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 106. According to a review in Victorian Studies, \\"Rectenwald thus offers a revisionist interpretation that, rather than understanding Holyoake's leadership of the free thought movement as a failed rhetorical attempt to make society more secular, sees it as marking a distinct moment in modernity.\\"Reagles, David G. Nineteenth-Century British Secularism: Science, Religion, and Literature by Michael Rectenwald (review). Victorian Studies, Vol. 59, No. 4 (Summer 2017), pp. 681–682. Critique of social justice and leftism in academia =@antipcnyuprof Twitter account= On September 12, 2016, Rectenwald created the Twitter account @antipcnyuprof and began tweeting criticisms of what he saw as excesses of political correctness and social justice ideology on North American colleges and universities. A student reporter for the Washington Square News, New York University's weekly student newspaper, discovered him; and he subsequently gave an interview revealing himself as the NYU faculty member behind the @antipcnyuprof Twitter handle. In a November 3, 2016 op-ed at The Washington Post, Rectenwald claimed that two days after the student interview, he was summoned by Dean Fred Schwarzbach and was \\"strongly encouraged to take a paid leave of absence.\\" Schwarzbach denied Rectenwald's claims and posted all email correspondence between the two from November 1 through November 11, showing that Rectenwald had requested the leave himself. =NYU cancels Yiannapoulos event= On October 30, 2018, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio requested that NYU cancel an in-class lecture on Halloween that was to be delivered the next day by Rectenwald's guest, the controversial British polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos. The mayor cited concerns about the availability of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to perform security duties at NYU during the same time they would be needed to police New York's Village Halloween Parade. NYU complied with the mayor's request. =Springtime for Snowflakes= In 2018, the New English Review Press published Rectenwald's memoir, Springtime for Snowflakes: Social Justice and Its Postmodern Parentage. Rectenwald recounts his academic career and his intellectual evolution. He critiques the contemporary social justice culture in the academy, arguing that it is rooted in socialist and postmodernist thought and describing its constituent concepts such as deconstruction, belief in toxic masculinity, social constructivism, and radical constructivism. Rectenwald concludes that such ideology has promoted an authoritarian and dogmatic culture in parts of the academy. Works =Books= The Eros of the Baby Boom Eras.

It is closely associated with the Namaqua National Park, with which it has a common border and management.  History   Purpose  A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\". This MPA is the first protection to critically endangered coastal ecosystem types in the Namaqua bioregion. The Northern Cape will benefit from additional ecotourism. Detailed ecosystem mapping and monitoring has been ongoing in this region since 1976 so this area can provide a baseline to understand human impacts of harvesting, mining, introduction of alien species and climate change.  Extent  The MPA is an inshore region in the depth range 0 to 150 m between the Spoeg River and Island Point, partly adjacent to the Namaqua National Park.

Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, SANParks, which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Geography  = Climate = = Seasonal variations in sea conditions =  Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Namaqua National Park Marine Protected Area is in the Benguela ecoregion The MPA is in the warm temperate Bengeula ecoregion to the west of Cape Point which extends northwards to the Orange River. There are a moderately large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. = Marine species diversity =  Animals  Fish: *Merluccius capensis (Cape hake) - nursery area Invertebrates: *(mussels) *Jasus lalandii (west coast rock lobsters)  Seaweeds Laminaria pallida (kelp) forests  Endemism  The MPA is in the cool temperate Benguela ecoregion to the west of Cape Point which extends northwards to the Orange River.

Although he had a doctorate in law, he was primarily known for his multi-faceted and prolific literary output which included poetry, plays, novels, essays, biographies, and literary and theatrical criticism. He was born in L'Isle-Jourdain, but apart from his military service during World War I, spent his entire career in Toulouse where he was a member of the Académie des Jeux floraux and the editor-in-chief of L'Express du Midi for many years. In 1925 the Académie française awarded him the Prix Montyon for his novel L'histoire tragique de la Belle Violante. Praviel died in Perpignan at the age of 68. Early life Praviel was born in L'Isle-Jourdain in southwestern France, the son of Félix and Noémie (née Tintelin) Praviel. His father was a successful businessman and notary who came from a long line of notaries and lawyers. He was educated as a boarder at the Jesuit lycée in Toulouse and then, at his father's wish, studied law at the University of Toulouse. He received his doctorate in law in 1901 with a thesis entitled Le Patronage des libérés. Praviel himself was a member of the Societé de Patronage des Libérés in Toulouse which advocated for the support and rehabilitation of ex-convicts and child criminals. However, from his early youth Praviel's primary interests were literary ones, and his decision to forsake the law for a career as a writer, although encouraged by his mother, ultimately led to an estrangement from his father. Praviel's interest in literature and drama manifested itself was he was still at school. He was at the center of Le Caousou's theatrical life, putting on plays during the school holidays and serving as the stage director and set designer as well as one of the actors. In 1895 he started a small theatre troupe called Societé de Saint- Genest which gave performances in the salons of Toulouse, and throughout his life he was considered a gifted amateur actor. As a young man he had also performed in plays by Corneille and Racine at the Jardin Royal in Toulouse. It was during that time that he fell in love with the actress Alice Gardenal. However, his hopes came to nothing when his mother opposed the marriage. Literary career and later years In 1897 Praviel founded L'Âme latine, a bi-monthly journal devoted to literature and poetry whose circle included the young poets and intellectuals Emmanuel Delbousquet, Pierre Fons, Joseph de Bonne, and Marc Lafargue. Praviel's friend Joseph de Pesquidoux once described him as the \\"D'Artagnan of the pen\\", and he dressed the part in his dark velvet jackets, wide-brimmed felt hats and a black cape lined with red velvet that was his constant companion. The Belgian journal La Lutte published a collection of his poetry, Poèmes mystiques, in 1900, and the following year L'Âme latine published another collection entitled La Ronde de cygnes. Both collections reflected his mystic Catholicism. Further collections of his religious poetry were published in 1904 (La Tragédie du Soir), 1909 (L'Exercice du chemin de la Croix), and 1913 (Le Cantique des saisons). He often presented his poems in contests at the Académie des Jeux floraux (Academy of the Floral Games). He was given the title of Master of the Floral Games in 1905. Five years later he was elected a Maintainer of the academy and occupied its Fifth Chair. By 1907 Praviel was the editor-in-chief of L'Express du Midi in Toulouse and continued to write for that paper and its successor La Garonne for the next thirty years. His pieces also appeared in the Mercure de France, La Revue hebdomadaire, Le Correspondant, and Le Gay Saber. He was mobilised into the French army at the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and served with the 88th Infantry of Auch until he was captured by the Germans in 1918. Both his parents died while he was away in the war. In 1907 he had married Marguerite Duval, the daughter of a prominent lawyer in Reims. The marriage produced two children, Gerard and Marie-Ange, but proved to be an unhappy one. Marguerite, plagued by ill-health, died in 1929. Praviel married again in 1934 to his first love, Alice Gardenal. During the course of his career Praviel received two prizes from the Académie française: the Prix Jules Davaine in 1916 and the Prix Montyon in 1925. The latter was for his novel L'histoire tragique de la Belle Violante which was inspired by the Fualdès affair, a mysterious murder which had gripped France in 1817. Praviel died in Perpignan at the age of 68. As stipulated in his will, he was buried in the red velvet-lined cape of his youth. In 1950 the published Hommage à Armand Praviel, a 120 page book with chapters on each aspect of his life and work written by his friends from the Académie française, Académie des Jeux floraux, and L'Âme latine.

He was Emeritus Professor of Obstetric and Gynaecology at the University of Manchester. Life Shaw was the son of David Shaw who was employed as an industrial chemist and Zilliah Shaw Née Fletcher who was the daughter of William Fletcher, who ran a firm that manufactured wool in Littleborough, Greater Manchester area. Shaw was educated at both Owens College and Manchester Grammar School before going on matriculate at the Victoria University of Manchester to study Medicine. While at university, Shaw was the president of the Students' Union and the debating society. Shaw graduated MB, ChB in 1903. Shaw was married twice. The first time he married was on 9 December 1920 to Nora née Jones, who was from Manchester and had two sons. Nora Shaw died in 1934. Shaw's first son became a physician with the same speciality as his father, namely Obstetrics and gynaecology. His second son was a soldier killed in Normandy in 1944.

Career Shaw's first clinical post as a resident was at Manchester Royal Infirmary and later at the Saint Mary's Hospital for Women and Children where he was a resident surgical officer. At Saint Mary's Shaw took part in establishing a pathology laboratory. Shaw passed his Doctor of Medicine (MD) with Gold Medal in 1906, with a thesis created from research into chronic metritis. Shaw started his career in a time when medicine and technology were undergoing rapid advancement as evidenced by the unique travelling experience he underwent at the end of his exams. To hear his results, Shaw travelled to university in a horse-drawn carriage to hear the result of his final examination one day and on the next day, he travelled by an electrically- driven tram. In 1912, Shaw was elected to the honorary staff of Saint Mary's Hospital for Women and Children. During 1919, Shaw was promoted to be honorary gynaecologist at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

At a later meeting between, in a casual conversation, Shaw put the idea of founding a new college with a sub-speciality to Blair-Bell. Awards and honours Shaw won many awards during his career. In 1936, Shaw was awarded an honorary fellowship of the American College of Surgeons. In 1939 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1947, Shaw was confirmed to the mastership of midwifery of the Society of Apothecaries honoris causa. In 1948 Shaw was awarded an honorary degree of Legum Doctor Queen's University Belfast.

Trumbull's earlier 1790 work, Washington at Verplanck's Point, which he had gifted to Washington's wife Martha, had been very well received. In consequence, Trumbull received a July, 1790, commission from the corporation for the City of New York, led by Mayor Richard Varick, to paint the president's portrait. Rather than beginning anew, Trumbull enormously scaled up the prior work, enlarging it from roughly 30\\" by 20\\" to nearly four times the size, 108\\" by 72\\". In composition and general character the two paintings are substantially the same, with only the middle background as seen through Washington's horse's legs changed, from a September 14, 1782 review of Continental Army troops he had staged for departing French commander-in-chief General Rochambeau to an idealized vision of Evacuation Day, Washington's return to New York City upon the British departure on November 25, 1783. This painting is located in the historic Governor's Room of New York City Hall. Background Trumbull in a letter to his mentor, the painter Benjamin West, on August 30, 1790 wrote: Composition The pose and general composition are virtual of copies of Washington at Verplanck's Point painted earlier in 1790, but instead of the background seen through the horse's legs being a romanticized depiction of a review of Continental Army troops at their encampment at New York's Verplanck's Point Washington had staged for departing French commander-in-chief General Rochambeau on September 14, 1782, it is an idealized vision of Evacuation Day, Washington's return to New York City upon the British departure on November 25, 1783.

They were formed in 1980 by immigrants from China of the ethnicity of Cantonese and Toisanese, and ABCs (American Born Chinese). They adopted the color white as their clothing to match the name of the set. Throughout the 80s, the gang was often engaged in bloody turf wars with other Queens gangs such as the younger Green Dragons. Their activities included extortion, kidnapping, illegal gambling, racketeering, drug trafficking, human trafficking, arson and murder. Territory In the early 1980s new gangs emerged in the peripheral of other New York City boroughs such as following the patterns of Chinese immigration. In Queens emerged a Chinese community in Flushing and the White Tigers were created from this community. As such the gang soon started to prey on residents by robbing and extorting local businesses. The White Tigers did have territory in upper Chinatown in Manhattan on Mott Street with permission from the Ghost Shadows but their territory was primarily in Queens which considered by specialists as a territory ripe for the picking. With such virgin territory it allowed a new gang like the White Tigers to prosper. The gang in time quickly became one of the dominant gangs in Queens. Membership Sources vary as to the size of the gang. One gang member said it had 10 core members and 20 to 30 peripheral members. Another survey said that like smaller gangs like the Green Dragons, Taiwan Brotherhood and Golden Star appear to have a maximum of 20 core members and 50 peripheral members. Elizabeth Glazer the chief of the organized crime unit in the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District, described the White Tigers as a relatively undisciplined gang of 35 to 40 members. What is known for sure for is that membership of the gang was regular to other gangs of the time in Flushing Queens compared to the larger gangs of Mahanttan like the Ghost Shadows and Flying Dragons which had 100 core members and 200 peripheral members. =Chris Chin= Chris Chin gang leader addressed in the hearing before Asian Organized Crime Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs First Session on October 3, November 5–6, 1991 =Wei Hung Lee= Wei Hung Lee arrested on June 2, 1993 for immigrant smuggling.

Initiation ceremony The White Tigers for being a gang non-affiliated to a Tong they did not have the same traditional values as gangs that were allied to older and institutional Triads. In a traditional Triad an especially promising juvenile delinquent is brought to a secret place, where he meets others who have also been recruited, Incense is burned and an oath they would is taken whereby the new recruits are made to swear lifelong allegiance to the Triad society: “I shall suffer death by five hundred thunderbolts if I do not keep this oath (…) I will always acknowledge my Hung [Triad] brothers when they identify themselves. If I ignore them I shall be killed by a myriad of swords (…) If I am arrested after committing an offence, I must accept my punishment and never try to implicate any of my sworn brothers. If I do, I will be killed by five hundred thunderbolts (…)” However one White Tiger member recalled he joined the gang by \\"accepting their invitation, going to a restaurant, celebrating by eating and drinking until we got drunk\\". There was no initiation ceremony. Human Smuggling Like the Fuk Ching gang, the White Tigers typically helped immigrant smugglers by meeting immigrants as they arrived in the United States by air or by sea and holding them captive until payment of a smuggling fee was arranged. In a house in Bayside, Queens, were found 22 Chinese immigrants being guarded by members of the White Tigers. The immigrants had arrived on June 2 1993 in California. Indictments In 1993, 17 White Tigers were indicted for murder by the NYPD and DEA.

Although some of her earlier work employed standard \\"Hochdeutsch\\" German, she is better remembered today for her poetry and prose texts written in the Saxon dialect. After 1945 her home city of Leipzig found itself in what became, in 1949, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). For various reasons Voigt's work disappeared from the shelves during the National Socialist years: her hopes that it would return to the magazines and bookshops after 1945 were dashed. It is widely thought that this was, at least in part, because her Saxon dialect writing was seen in some quarters as disrespectful. Walter Ulbricht, the national leader between 1949 and 1971, also came from Leipzig, which meant that the dialect and accent of Saxony were the dialect and accent of the leader. In West Germany, across the internal border, her work was again published during the 1950s, and after Walter Ulbricht left the stage it also experienced a revival in East Germany, where a particularly effective cheer leader was (and post-reunification remains) the cabaret artiste and impresario Gisela Oechelhaeuser. Life =Provenance= Helene \\"Lene\\" Alma Wagner was born at her grandmother's home in Leipzig. The circumstances of her birth may have contributed to subsequent confusion as to its precise date. Her mother had already given birth in 1887 and again in 1888, but the first son had been born dead and the second died after three hours. The understandable anxiety accompanying Helene's birth meant that she was subjected to an \\"emergency baptism\\" on the day she was born. Her godparents were her mother's sister and grandmother along with a theology student who may also have been a maternal relative. The doctors gave the parents little reason to hope that their baby daughter might survive, but survive she did. Her parents had married in Leipzig in 1887. Her mother, born Alma Maria Pleißner (1860-1924), came from an academic family. She always spoke standard \\"Hochdeutsch\\" German and was uncompromising in her insistence that Lene should do the same. Lene inherited something of her mother's critical approach to life. While her husband was alive Alma Maria Wagner stayed at home and looked after the little family. Later she was employed as a housekeeper. By the time she died she was living in a \\"poor house\\" (\\"Armenstift\\"). Lene's father, Karl Bruno Wagner (1873-1917), worked as a typesetter. Lene later wrote that he came from a \\"family of mountain peasants\\" (\\"Gebirgsbauerngeschlecht\\"). From her father Lene inherited a talent for humour. He liked to use the local dialect. Sources indicate that Lene probably also inherited from her father a tendency to suffer with Depression and Psychoses. Karl Wagner drowned in 1917 when he was just 54. =Childhood= She grew up in Leipzig. The family moved house several times while she was still small. Lene Wagner was a wild child and something of a prankster. For six years she attended school locally: she excelled academically, especially in lessons on Religion. Then, at her mother's wish, between 1905 and 1910 she attended a training establishment for Kindergarten work. Her interests lay in another direction, however. By the time she was 15 she had started to write poetry. In the end she undertook an apprenticeship for work in the book trade. Her childhood seems to have involved the omnipresence of relatives: aunts, in particular, were always in the background. The family was evidently a close- knit one. She loved to read, later naming the Viennese novelist-poet Ludwig Anzengruber as the favourite author of her childhood years. It was presumably from Anzengruber that she learned to identify social and political issues, and how to present them with humour. After she grew up Lene Voigt also recalled a period of her childhood when she was sent away to live with a church minister in a small mining village in the Erzgebirgischer mountain region, near the border with Bohemia and to the south of Leipzig. Precisely when, where and why she was sent to the mountains is unclear, but the arrangement was, in any case, temporary. =Employment= As was usual in working-class families at the time, Lene's childhood was all too brief. According to several sources she left her parents' home as soon as she could. She was only 12 when she took work as a courier for a dolls' clinic, collecting dolls in need of attention and returning them to their homes following repair. This involved a very small girl walking the streets of Leipzig with an implausibly large basket. She was later able to recall the image and joke about it, but the work itself was perfectly serious. After she had been persuaded by her mother to enroll at an academy for Kindergarten work, between 1903 and approximately 1905 she worked as a nanny for a prosperous family. As part of the work, she used to create puppetry games to keep the children amused. It was the \\"background humour\\" incorporated in one of these puppetry games that led to her dismissal. There followed a succession of jobs in Leipzig. At one stage she took an office job with the Teubner publishing business, and in 1912 she joined the Köhler Book wholesale traders (\\" Barsortiment Köhler\\"). =Family tragedy= After at least two \\"disappointing relationships with men\\", on 19 or 24 September Helene Wagner married Friedrich Otto Voigt. He was an orchestral musician who played in the Paul Lincke Orchestra, and the marriage took place in the St. Thomas Church. Unfortunately war had broken out at the end of July, and after the marriage ceremony Voigt was almost immediately conscripted into the army. He returned from the war alive but missing an arm, which put an end to his musical career. Between 1917 and the end of February 1919 Lene Voigt was employed as a sales representative by Insel Verlag (publishers): her departure was greatly regretted by Anton Kippenberg, the head of the business. The birth of her son, Alfred on 10 September 1919 provides a clue as to the reason for her resignation from Insel. The marriage ended in divorce in 1920. Nevertheless, Lene remained in touch with Voigt, and later on good terms with his second family, for the rest of her life. By 1923 Lene Voigt was working for the foreign trade subsidiary of \\"Barsortiment Köhler\\", which collapsed in August of that year. This turned out to have been her last experience of full- time employment. She now became a \\"Geistesarbeiterin\\" which was a contemporary euphemism for self-employment. =Bereavements= Living alone and without permanent work, Lene Voigt faced a compounding tragedy on 6 February 1924 when Alfed died from Tubercular Meningitis. He was not quite five. She tried to work through her grief by writing. Happiness of a kind returned at some point between 1926 1928 when she teamed up with Karl Geil, an unemployed anarchist and opera singer. He described Voigt as the one great love of his life. Geil was married to someone else, but lived apart from his wife. He was a member of a progressive movement known as the \\"Vagabond Brotherhood\\" which involved a rather itinerant lifestyle. For a year or so from 1928 the meetings between Geil and Vogt became progressively less frequent, although they maintained an intensely passionate relationship by letter. In January 1929 Voigt's worst fears were confirmed: Karl Geil was more seriously sick than he could admit to himself. He collapsed unexpectedly on a street in Dresden and was taken to hospital where on 19 January 1929 he died as the result of a stroke. It took considerable effort for Voigt to have his ashes returned from Dresden to Leipzig. The deaths within a few years first of her child and then of her lover plunged her into severe depression which would haunt her for the rest of her life. Friends advised a new start. Later in 1929 Voigt moved to the northern port city of Bremen, an industrial hub with a seething political and cultural energy. She arrived with little more than a typewriter and a small suitcase. The next few years were some of her most productive. Some of her best known books date from this period. She also benefited from frequent visits from Robert Meier, an admirer twelve years her junior who became a lifelong friend. Many of her texts, including some that never found a publisher, have survived only because she sent copies to Meier, and Meier took good care of them. =Success followed by dictatorship= Until the Hitler government took power Lene Voigt now enjoyed a hitherto unfamiliar level of financial security. The rapid transition to one-party dictatorship during 1933 changed that. Even after 1933 her books failed to follow the official orthodoxies. Her humour was not to the liking of the authorities. She became an object of government suspicion and a target for Gestapo surveillance. She herself became increasingly unsettled, relocating to Lübeck in 1934 and to Flensburg in 1935. For a long time she lived only in rented furnished apartments. =\\"Nicht sächsisch, sondern jiddisch\\"= One respect in which the Hitler government was keen for Germany to catch up with Britain and France involved centralsing state power. Government strategy extended well beyond replacing Germany's former administrative structure. In Saxony Martin Mutschmann, the regional governor (\\"Gauleiter\\") established the \\"Heimatwerk Sachsen – Verein zur Förderung des sächsischen Volkstums e. V.\\" (loosely, \\"...association for promoting Saxon popular culture and identity\\") in 1936. The idea was to take control of all regional cultural aspirations and redirect them in support of party goals. The \\"Heimatwerk Sachsen\\" existed till 1945, intended to inspire the entire region of Saxony to identify with the National Socialist state. As part of this mission, the \\"Heimatwerk Sachsen\\" banned the Saxon dialect. There was no longer any place for \\"Saxon comedy, joke makers and jewifying literati\\" , which had simply led to \\"mutilation of the language in Saxony\\" (\\"Verschandelung der sächsischen Sprache\\"). Lene Voigt was expressly identified as part of the problem. Saxon-dialect literature was \\"unheroic\\": it was almost all pulped. The Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda placed a nationwide ban on further publication of Voigt's books. The security services were only too well aware that she not only wrote texts using Saxon dialect, but that before 1933 she had also worked with politically left-leaning publications and that she had openly asserted her atheism. Voigt did not react robustly to the increasingly threatening situation in which she now found herself. Intensified surveillance, proscription, the publishing ban and the resulting economic hardship led her to a form of psychosis. Between 18 May and 15 June 1936 she was placed in a mental hospital in Schleswig for the treatment of mental instability and hallucinations. When she was released it was \\"without mental disorder\\". She herself diagnosed her illness as stemming from delusions of persecution. That may have been necessary to secure her release, but at least one commentator has questioned her use of the word \\"delusion\\" in this context. It is not known why Lene Voigt relocated to Munich in 1937, but her reasons for leaving the city are apparent: the newspaper of the local Nazi paramilitaries (SA) launched a press campaign against her, ostensibly in connection with a Saxon-dialect card-game. In or before 1938 she relocated to Hamburg and then to Berlin where she lived till 1940. In 1934 Lene Voigt had acquired a second home in Leipzig, and she had held on to it during the ensuing six years. In 1940 she was therefore able to return to the city of her birth. War had returned to central Europe at the end of the previous summer, and she was now conscripted for a form of national service obligation (\\"Dienstverpflichtung\\"). That involved working for the Giesecke+Devrient specialist printing company which at that time had its main business in Leipzig. Later she was sent to work as an invoicing clerk with Lange & Meuche Verlag, which was part of the Rothbarth publishing conglomerate. She also spent time as an in-patient at Leipzig University Mental Clinic during 1940. More precise details of how, why and when are not available due to the subsequent wartime destruction of her medical records. =Soviet occupation zone= The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division reached Leipzig in April 1945 and completed its capture after \\"fierce urban action\\".Stanton, Shelby, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946 (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 78, 139. By this time, however. President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill and Marshal Stalin had already agreed a postwar military settlement for the western two thirds of Germany which would divide the territory into four separate occupation zones. Under the agreement Leipzig was to be administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. Accordingly, in July 1945 the United States army withdrew from the city and Soviet forces moved in. By this time both the publishing firms who had published Voigt's work before the National Socialists had banned it had moved what remained of their businesses from Leipzig to Munich, which had ended up under American military occupation. With the twelve year National Socialist period at an end, Lene Voigt might hope for better times ahead, and indeed her texts were included in \\"Die Rampe\\", Leipzig's first postwar cabaret show. Sadly, there would be no large-scale return to the popular mainstream, however. She overworked herself, worried about the future, and forgot to eat enough, at one stage weighing just 38.3 kg (84 pounds). She was also suffering with climacteric issues. Reports of hallucinations and signs of mental instability led to a diagnosis (subsequently corrected) of \\"Schizophrenic episodes\\" and re-admission to the University Mental Clinic on 11 June 1946. She remained there for fourteen days and was probably subjected to the conventional remedies of the time: Electroconvulsive therapy, Barbiturates and physical restraints (\\"Netzbehandlung\\"). The University Mental Clinic into which she was admitted in 1946 was not the one in which she had been treated in 1940, however. That had been destroyed by an air attack in 1943: provision had been rehoused. In 1945 there were 200 beds available for psychiatry and neurology treatment which was completely inadequate. In the summer of 1946, when Lene Voigt was admitted, 25 cases were being refused admission every day. Inside the Soviet occupation zone hospitals were experiencing food shortages and shortages of heating fuel that were in many cases measurably worse than during the war years. Many of the doctors, nurses and other specialists still had not returned from the war, while others who were in Leipzig were still unable to work, pending denazification processing. Due to the shortage of capacity at the University Clinic Voigt was transferred, on 26 June 1946, to the Saxony-Altscherbitz District Hospital (\\"Landesheilanstalt Altscherbitz\\"): gradually her condition improved and she returned to her writing. She was discharged on 24 February 1947. She was lucky. The Saxony-Altscherbitz District Hospital was a specialist establishment for psychiatric and nervous disorders which even by the standards of the time and place had a terrible record. A later study determined that during 1947 887 patients accommodated in the institution - equivalent to 38% of all patients - died as a result of deficiencies in the care provided (\\"aufgrund der Mangelversorgung\\"). One of the poems Voigt wrote shortly before her discharge in February 1947 was entitled \\"Wir 'armen Irren'\\" (loosely, \\"We, 'poor lunatics'\\"). Coming across this work prompted Dietfried Müller-Hegemann (1910-1989), one of the hospital physicians who had overseen her treatment, to investigate Voigt's case further and to correct the \\"Schizophrenic episodes\\" diagnosis which had led to her hospitalisation the previous June. It was now determined that in response to the exceptionally burdensome life events to which she had been subjected, she had become ill with repeating \\"Reactive Psychosis\\" (wiederholt \\"Reaktive Psychose\\"). In 1966, after he had retired from the hospital (and after Lene Voigt herself had died), Müller-Hegemann published a \\"Textbook for psychiatry and neurology\\" in which he wrote up the case in some detail. Although he did not name his patient, he did include sufficient details to identify her beyond all reasonable doubt. As a result, among several generations of students and practitioners of Psychiatric Medicine Lene Voigt became as well known (or better known) as the subject of a celebrated case study as she was as a published author and poet of German-language and Saxon dialect texts. Südfriedhof (South Cemetery) in Leipzig states her birth date incorrectly. According to the Lene Voigt Foundation, current knowledge confirms that she was born on 2 May 1891. Between 1947 and 1949 Lene Voigt worked in the Food Ration Cards department for the Leipzig region. Little is known of her life circumstances during this time. =Institutionalised= On 6 July 1949 Voigt was admitted into the Leipzig-Dosen District Psychiatric Clinic. Notes made at the time of her admission suggest manic aspects to her behaviour. She \\"danced waltzes in front of the admitting physician and reportedly hallucinated and gave out paranoid utterances\\". By August 1949 the acute phase of her condition had subsided, but she expressed reluctance to leave the hospital because she thought she might be unable to manage with life's daily demands if she were to go back to living on her own. Instead the hospital administrators employed her as a live-in document courier. The hospital's \\"pavilion-based\\" layout ensured a continuing need for documents to be delivered from one building to another. This provided her with the necessary measure of security. She began to make regular visit to the city centre and she also resumed her writing. Hospital administrators from that time would remember her as an exceptionally well read woman with an intense interest in current events and a strong willingness to engage in conversation. She was generous in giving away her own written pieces, which by this time were frequently handwritten. Lene Voigt lived at the hospital in Leipzig-Dosen for thirteen years. She was regarded as a reliable employee. The only wish she expressed consistently was that she might end her days at the Fritz Austel Retirement Home. The hospital management backed her in this. However, on 16 July 1962 she died in the hospital wing of the District Psychiatric Clinic. Her death was almost entirely overlooked at the time when it happened, apart from a two line announcement in the local newspaper. It was only in 1985 that a gravestone was placed over her grave, and only in 2002 that her remains were disinterred and reburied with other distinguished citizens in the \\"Artists' Section\\" (\\"Künstlerabteilung\\") of the Leipzig Südfriedhof (South Cemetery). Works Lene Wagner was fifteen when, in 1906, her first published contribution, a \\"gymnastics society humoresque\\", was published in \\"Der Leipziger\\". In 1913 she became a regular contributor to the \\"Leipziger Hausfrau\\" newspaper, and in 1914, for the first time, her work was included in a book. The book was an anthology entitled \\"Dichtung und Prosa von Leipziger Frauen\\" (\\"Poetry and Prose by Leipzig Women\\"). Over the next few years she continued to contribute regularly both to \\"Der Leipziger\\" and to \\"Leipziger Hausfrau\\": her pieces were generally in the entertainment genre, and often used the Saxon dialect. In 1920 she receives her first mention in the Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender: her entry in the biennial biographical directory (of German writers) mentions her membership of the ASV (national writers' association) and describes her as an author of sketches, satires and Saxon dialect poetry. What she wrote was not merely entertaining, nor even just satirical-political: Voigt made no secret of her sympathy for the recently formed Communist Party (though there are no indications that she ever became a party member). She contributed pieces to \\"Die Rote Fahne\\" (\\"... Red Flag), the party newspaper. From 1921 she also wrote for \\"Der Drache\\" (\\"... Dragon\\"), a satirical magazine, and for the \\"Sächsische Arbeiterzeitung\\" (\\"... Workers' Newspaper\\"). Between 1923 and 1926 she was also writing for the \\"Proletarische Heimstunden\\", a short-lived anti-militarist magazine, her work displaying a style of casual inconsequential humorous journalism that rapidly disappeared after 1933 and has never really returned. More recent studies of Lene Voigt tend to focus only on her better known works: Saxon dialect variants of ballads and other literary classics. These are not simply \\"translations\\" into Saxon. The well calibrated humour of the author endows them, frequently, with a less heroic and a more human tone than the German- language original versions. Lene Voigt's reputation was at its height between the middle 1920s and the early 1930s. She worked for a number of newspapers and magazines in Saxony, but her much work could be read across Germany and indeed in German language newspapers further afield. She felt a particular affinity with the magazine \\"Der gemütliche Sachse\\" (in 1929 renamed \\"Der lustige Sachse\\") and over time became its principal contributor. A first Phonograph record#78 rpm disc developmentsgramophone record set appeared featuring Voigt's anecdites, poems, skits and parodies - not all of them just in just in dialect. It proved successful and lucrative. Books were published, collecting her dialect poems and prose texts together: \\"Säk'sche Balladen\\" (1925), \\"Säk'sche Glassigger\\" (1925), \\"Mir Sachen. Lauter gleenes Zeich zum Vortragen\\" (2 volumes, 1928), *In Sachsen gewachsen\\" (1932), \\"Die sächsische Odyssee\\" (1933) and \\"Leibzcher Lindenblieten\\" (1935). Alongside these dialect works, she also published the autobiographical narrative \\"Mally der Familienschreck (1927)\\" and a travel novel, \\"Vom Pleißestrand nach Helgoland\\" (1934) in in German before the publication ban came into effect. Except at the most acute phases of her illness Lene Voigt never stopped writing, even after 1949 when the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), and she herself moved into the Psychiatric Clinic where she would spend her final thirteen years. However, during those final years she was no longer paid for any of her writing, because with the country under the direction of the relentlessly unamused (and Saxon) First Secretary Ulbricht, any \\"Saxon utterance\\" risked being interpreted by the authorities as a form of mockery. During the Ulbricht years just one Lene Voigt poem - which she had sent to a newspaper as a \\"reader's letter\\" - was published. Astonishingly, she was never forgotten by people in Saxony, however. In West Germany new editions of her compilations \\"Balladen\\" and \\"Glassigger\\" did appear in the 1950s, but the author received no money, nor even a copy. Worse than that, thanks to the Cold war divisions of the time, and the growing impenetrability of the border between the two Germanys, she was not even aware of these new editions of her work. In East Germany, after Ulbricht died (and so more than ten years after Voigt's own death) her work did reappear in the press during the mid 1970s. Then, in 1982, a Voigt book appeared in her homeland: \\"Bargarohle, Bärchschaft und sächs'sches Ginsdlrblut\\" presented a cross-section of her life's work, including magazine contributions, dialect works and satirical pieces. A second volume followed in 1984. As East Germany approached its own time of decisive changes the focus of editors tended increasingly to concentrate on Voigt's more overtly political texts. In 1978/79 Rowohlt Verlag acquired the publishing rights to \\"Balladen\\" and \\"Glassigger\\" which have enjoyed unbroken popularity in West Germany, and since 1990 Germany, ever since. Revival and the Lene Voigt Society During the 1980s and 1990s, to the extent that she had ever been forgotten, Lene Voigt was rediscovered, especially in the eastern part of Germany. Wolfgang U. Schütte, in particular, undertook and from 1983 published new research work. Further information and insights into Voigt's life became available only after 1990. Since 1990 there has been an emergence of so-called Ostalgie, whereby people express nostaligia for what was good about the German Democratic Republic (1949-1989) without (in most cases) seeking to downplay the political repression and economic failings that led to its collapse. Part of \\"Ostalgie\\" has been a booming interest in political cabaret which before totalitarianism was always more celebrated in the central industrial cities such as Berlin and Leipzig than further west. Three stars and scholars from he world of cabaret in Leipzig who have shown particular commitment to reviving the poetry and lyrics written by Lene Voigt are Bernd-Lutz Lange, Tom Pauls and Gisela Oechelhaeuser. The Lene Voigt Society (\\"Lene-Voigt-Gesellschaft\\") was founded in 1995 in Leipzig is a particular focus of commitment to discovering more aboud Lene Voigt's life and work. It has taken responsibility in respect of a number of publications on Voigt including, not leastly, a six volume compilation of her own works. The non-profit organisation has followed in her tracks and, in particular, worked to identify and draw attention to all the many Leipzig apartments and other homes and institutions in which she lived during a somewhat unsettled life. As researches are pursued, it often turns out that earlier details of Voigt's life have been incorrectly recorded, and one of the Lene Voigt Society objectives is to promote the publication of a new biography to build on Wolfgang Schütte's 1983 with all the additional information that has come to light - not leastly through Schütte's own efforts - while eliminating those errors that remain in the public arena.

Tanno became a member of the Nankatsu Labor Union, and was especially interested in its communist Hyōgikai wing where she established and was head of its women's division. Though many of her communist peers shifted to anarchist communism, Tanno and her husband, Watanabe Masanosuke, the Japanese Communist Party's general secretary, remained Bolshevist communists. Early life Tanno Setsu was born in Fukushima prefecture in 1902 to a large family. She moved when she was 10 years old to Hitachi, Ibaraki prefecture when her father found a job as a carpenter building the Number Two Hydroelectric Plant in Daiyūin, the smelting district. Despite her father having an above average salary, her family was always short on money. She lived in a dirt floor tenement house intended for low-ranking miners without running water. As an adolescent, Tanno's responsibilities included caring for her baby sibling. Tanno desired to enter school to become a teacher, but there was not enough money to do so. Instead, following her elementary school education, she went to Honzan hospital's nurse training school. The spring of her 16th birthday, her family was no longer able to support her financially, so Tanno paid for her clothes and food using the hospital's daily wage. During her studies, she was a subscriber to the magazine Fujin Kōron. Tanno was slowly exposed to communist and socialist policy by her male peers, Sōma Ichiro, Kawai Yoshitora, and Kitajima Kichizō, who had picked up socialism from Oka Sensei, a teacher at the nursing college who supported worker's liberation. She joined a coal mining union in 1919 connected with Japan General Federation of Labor. Early 1920s =Arrival to Tokyo= Tanno's friend, Kawai Yoshitora, moved to Tokyo in September 1920, but was quickly arrested and sent to prison in Sugamo for his ties to the Socialist Alliance. From prison, Kawai sent Tanno, Sōma, and Kitajima copies of Ōsugi Sakae's Labor News. In 1921 without fulfilling her required three years of service to the nursing school, she moved to Tokyo's Kameido district with Sōma and Kitajima to reunite with Kawai. She initially found a job at Juntendō Hospital with Kawai's help, but began work at an at- cost clinic in Shimbashi soon after. Under Kawai's encouragement, she joined the Gyōminkai (Enlightened People's Society), a communist study group, and began living at their office. She also became involved with the Sekirankai, a socialist organization for Japanese women, and was involved with many May Day demonstrations. During this time, Tanno began studying English at Kanda English-language School and organized a club to analyze Tane Maku Hito, a proletarian magazine. After an incident where a student of the school attempted to publish poetic works speaking out against the government in a new magazine, Tanno was questioned by police, and her involvement with left- leaning groups was written in newspapers at the time. Her family encouraged Tanno to return home under the false pretense that her mother was sick, with the intention of preventing Tanno from returning and participating further in Japan's growing socialist movement. Amid a festival crowd, Tanno was able to flee from her family to a train station and escape back to Tokyo. =Formation of the Nankatsu Labor Union= Tanno continued attending Gyōminkai and Sekirankai meetings upon her return to Tokyo in 1922. She also joined the Nankatsu Labor Union, founded by Masanosuke Watanabe in 1922, along with Kawai, Kitajima, and Sōma. Believing that intellectual groups would not help change conditions for workers, Tanno quit her job in nursing and began working in Kameido district as a Seikosha watch factory worker under the name Sakanoue Kiyo. At this time, the Japanese communist part was dividing into anarchist and Bolshevist wings, in which Tanno remained in allegiance with the latter. Tanno met Watanabe Masonosuku upon seeing his lecture on Das Kapital during a Gyōminkai meeting. Kawai Yoshitora encouraged the two together, and they became friends. When Tanno was lured home by family to Onahama a third time, Watanabe attempted to persuade her family to let her return with him to Tokyo, but was unsuccessful. Tanno managed to escape and return to Kameido in January 1923. In March 1923, she joined the Nankatsu Labor Union on their walk from Tokyo to Noda, Chiba in support of a soy sauce manufacturer's strike. In April, she joined Kawai Yoshitora's newly created Communist Youth League. Police began arresting those associated with the communist party in June, but members were quickly released and went into hiding. Watanabe turned himself in to authorities, believing his incarceration would prevent further arrests, and was taken to prison in Ichigaya. Tanno then moved in with Watanabe's mother. =Surviving the Great Kantō Earthquake and Kameido Incident= While on her way to attend a Yōkakai meeting, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake struck. She rushed home to check on Watanabe's mother who was alive and had nearly escaped the collapse of her home. The fires and impending tsunami encouraged Tanno to flee across the Katsunishi Bridge with Kawai's family and Watanabe's mother. Upon her return, many of the displaced Nankatsu Labor Union members chose to live in the office, taking turns watching out for the authorities. On September 2, 1923, the Special Higher Police came and arrested somewhere between 6 and 8 Nankatsu Labor Union members at their office in an event known as the Kameido Incident. Tanno managed to escape by giving her alias Sakanoue Kiyo and running to hide on the second-floor window's ledge behind a sliding tatami door. The Kameido police continued to make arrests, and many of the union members were killed in prison, including Tanno's nursing school friends Kawai Yoshitora and Kitajima Kichizō. Tanno Setsu married Watanabe Masanosuke in 1924. Late 1920s In 1926, Tanno went underground with the Nankatsu Labor Union, hiding out in For Rent Houses from authories. Money was very scarce, and she was almost recognized and arrested on several occasions. =Nankatsu Labor Union Women's department proposal= Tanno attempted to propose to Nankatsu Labor Union's communist Hyōgikai wing the formation of a Women's Department in 1926. However, her proposal was rejected by Hyōgikai leaders on the basis that a new department specifically for women was unnecessary. Together with Watanabe, Tanno proposed the department again and became the head of the new department in 1927. =Imprisonment of Nanshoku Labor Union members= On March 15, 1928, many Nankatsu Labor Union members were discovered and arrested. Tanno, and others who remained, continued to shift their residence around and operating under aliases, with the men dressing as stock brokers. However, many members continued to be arrested, and incidents between the police and communist members began to make newspaper headlines. On December 3, 1928, Tanno jumped through a window to escape police, but was quickly caught after jumping a fence. She was incarcerated at Tomizaka Police Station, where she was questioned for three days and brutally beaten. After a week, Tanno learned from the police officials that her husband Watanabe had been killed in Formosa. Tanno was transferred around to multiple police stations before her trial on October 3, 1928. In prison, she contracted tuberculosis and temporarily left on parole. Though she attempted to avoid the authorities, Tanno was rearrested. =Release= Tanno remained in prison until September 1938. Immediately following her release, she tried to flee to China, but was unable to.「丹野セツ」、デジタル版 日本人名大辞典+Plus Following World War II, Tanno's activism transitioned from advocating socialism to hospital administration and reform. She established and later became director of Yotsugi Clinic in Katsushika, Tokyo. Personal life =Relationship with family= Tanno had a strained relationship with her family, who did not share her political beliefs. On multiple occasions, she was lured home by letters saying someone had become sick, only to find everyone well. On her return trips home, she was often locked in her room and not allowed to leave without a family escort. On at least one occasion, she was physically beaten by her younger brother. =Relationship with Watanabe Masanosuke= Tanno met Watanabe in 1923 during a Gyōminkai meeting presentation of Das Kapital. At the time, Watanabe's previous girlfriend, a worker at the Nagamine Celluloid Factory, had left him because her parents could not support Watanabe's political views. Tanno and Watanabe were initially not very close, but urged together by their mutual friend Kawai Yoshitora, a relationship began. In 1924, Tanno and Watanabe married, and began their married life in the Nankatsu labor union office alongside Watanabe's mother. They never had children.

The site was first discovered by the Museum of the Rockies in 1994 and has produced over 2,500 elements since its discovery. Apart from approximately 12 theropod teeth, stegosaur limb material, and two conchostracans found at the site, these elements almost exclusively belong to specimens of the sauropod dinosaur Diplodocus sp. This deposit of fossils is thought to be the result of an age-segregated herd of these dinosaurs congregating at a limited water source and eventually succumbing to drought conditions. Some debate has arisen regarding the age of the individuals found at the site. Originally the diplodocid specimens from the MDQ were thought to consist solely of juveniles and sub-adults based on the small size of the fossils and the low levels of ossification encountered in these elements. More recently, however, histological sampling of the bones indicates that there may be two populations at this locality: 'normal' young diplodocids with immature bone tissues, and a second population that is likewise small, but exhibits mature bone tissues - potentially indicating that some of these individuals may be dwarfs, or indicative of a regionally, small statured diplodocid population. The site was initially discovered by volunteers from the Museum of the Rockies on Mother’s Day in 1994. Teams from that museum excavated the site for two field seasons, collecting approximately 500 elements. Approximately 2,000 more elements were collected from 2000 to 2012 by crews from the Cincinnati Museum Center. Since 2017, crews from the Bighorn Basin Paleontological Institute have been excavating the site with the remains being prepared at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University and being reposited at the Cincinnati Museum Center, Museum of Natural History and Science.

They went through a number of line-up changes until their current formation that includes founding member Vats Iyengar (vocals/guitar), bassit Ravi Nair and recent additions Saakallya Biswas (guitars, backing vocals) and Neilroy Miranda (drums). Amidst these changes and intense domestic touring, the band recorded and released its debut EP Canvas of Silence in 2014. With their most enduring line-up, they released their debut and latest album Insignify (2018).  Etymology  Vocalist Vats Iyengar stated in a 2015 interview that drummer Praveen Kumar came up with the name Rainburn. He also explained: \\"I'm a big fan of bands that work with opposites. Like Led and Zeppelin or Black and Sabbath. The name suggests that we are covering a very wide spectrum of music. I like Metallica but that kind of name would be so limiting to me. Rainburn allows us that luxury.\\"  History  Rainburn was founded by keyboardist Avik Chakravarty and vocalist/guitarist Vats Iyengar in 2011. The duo was soon joined by drummer Praveen Kumar (Blood & Iron) and bassist Jayaram Kasi. Since its inception, the band has gone through a number of line-up changes, apart from some financial bad times. In 2012, they started to gig, first in their hometown of Bangalore, then in southern India. Also in that year, Jayaram left and was replaced by Shishir Gupta and the quartet recorded two demo songs, \\"End of Sleep\\" and \\"Listen Through the Noise\\". In 2013, the band went through several successive line-up changes: Avik left and was replaced by keyboardist Ashwin Ethiraj, but he quickly left too and the band decided to hire a second guitarist instead: Abhishek Prakash (ex-Groove Chutney). He didn't last long either and quit the quartet as they were recording their debut EP, being replaced by Toshimoa Jamir. Following a 2014 local release, they globally released their debut EP Canvas of Silence, which was defined by The Hindu as \\"a brilliant blend of opposing Indo-progressive tonalities that throb together in eclectic energy, exuding the band's vibrant take on music that is rooted and yet atmospheric\\". It was ranked as the 4th best 2015 progressive rock album by Classic Rock. By that time, they were already thinking of a full- length album. In early 2015, the band faced another formation change: Toshimoa and Shishir left and were replaced by Vineet Gogoi and Allan Julius Fernandes, respectively. In July of that year, they co-organized and co-curated (with Coshish) the progressive rock music festival Progworks. In October, they were joined on stage by Ted Leonard (Spock's Beard) for an unplugged performance of \\"Refuge\\". By 2016, Fernandes and Gogoi left and were replaced by Ravi Nair and Paraj Kumar Singh, respectively (the latter on a live basis only). In the following year, the band released its first music video, \\"Merchant of Dreams\\", a single coming from their then upcoming debut full-length album, by then known as The Anthropic Conceit and expected to be funded by a campaign in Fuel a Dream and succeeded by a tour. By 2018, however, the album was being promoted with a new title: Insignify. It was elected one of the best 2018 Indian albums by Rolling Stone India. In 2019, they released their second EP, Resignify, consisting of acoustic versions of songs from their two previous releases. In May 2020, the band announced on their Facebook page that two members had departed sometime late 2019. A few days later, they announced their new guitarist and backing vocalist, Saakallya Biswas. On 11 June, they officially announced that longtime drummer Praveen Kumar had left the band since late 2019. On 9 September, they announced Neilroy Miranda as their new drummer.  Musical style  The band is normally defined as a progressive rock ensemble. In a 2015 interview, drummer Praveen Kumar stated that \\"the genre also allows a lot of scope to experiment and better ourselves.\\" Vocalist Vats Iyengar added: The band members have different influences and musical tastes. Vats is a fan of pop and progressive rock while Praveen enjoys modern heavy metal. The band is also influenced by Indian and fusion music such as Shakti and Prasanna.

The bloodless coup d'état saw Algeria's first President, Ahmed Ben Bella, arrested and his closest supporters imprisoned by Boumédiène and his allies, principally in the Algerian People's National Army (the land force of the Algerian People's National Armed Forces). The arrest of Ben Bella occurred on 19 June 1965.  Background  Ahmed Ben Bella, first president of the Algerian Republic.Houari Boumédiène, at the time Algerian Minister of Defence. Following the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), with the help of then Chief of Staff Houari Boumédiène and the National Liberation Army (ALN), Ahmed Ben Bella was elected as Prime Minister in September 1962, ousting former Prime Minister Benyoucef Benkhedda. Owing to his support of Ben Bella, Boumédiène was appointed Defense Minister by Ben Bella and remained in this position until 1976. From 1962 to 1965, Ben Bella governed in an often erratic manner and centralized more and more government institutions by appointing himself the Secretary General of the Party, minister of the Interior, and the head of other bodies. Concerns of Ben Bella's demagogic behavior pervaded the Algerian government, with many government cadres coming to Boumédiène to voice their worries and complaints about the President. Boumédiène spent time traveling in early 1965, making trips to Baghdad, Cairo, and Moscow. In Cairo, he represented Algeria at a summit of Arab countries and met with Soviet leadership in Moscow. In April 1965, Ben Bella ordered local police to report directly to him rather than through the normal channels in the Ministry of Interior. The interior minister, Ahmed Medeghri, one of Boumédiène's closest associates, resigned in protest. By late May, Boumédiène had begun having serious conversations with leading government figures, mostly in the army, on removing Ben Bella. The three central initial conspirators allied to Boumédiène were Abdelkader Chabou, Djamel, and Hocine, however by early June the circle of conspirators had grown to include Chief of Staff of the ANP, Tahar Zbiri, the commander of the 1st military region (\\"l'Algerois\\"), and other regional officers throughout Algeria. Final impetuses for the coup include: * Ben Bella's announcement on 12 June of a politburo meeting on the 19th. The purpose of the meeting: to discuss the reorganization of the armed forces and cabinet, and reshuffle the military leadership. He did not specify who was to be replaced, which put all of these government officials in danger of losing their positions if they did not act quickly. * Ben Bella's plans for the armed forces: since independence, the ALN had been the military of Algeria but regional militias also existed. Ben Bella drafted plans to expand the people's militias while simultaneously reducing the role of the military. *Ben Bella's plans for the removal of minister for foreign affairs and Boumédiène ally, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who later became President of Algeria in 1999. Bouteflika was scheduled to be removed on the 22nd, just three days after the coup took place. *Ben Bella's current location: he had left Algiers for the city of Oran on 12 June, which gave Boumédiène time to organize the coup. Ben Bella gave a speech in Oran on the 17th, and returned to Algiers on the 18th, only hours before the coup was to be executed. By mid June, there was a feeling of emergency within the army, leading many commanders to agree to execute a plan that they had no real knowledge of. The coup plan was designed carefully, with Boumédiène's goal being to execute \\"the most elegant coup d'etat\\" in recent memory. A friend of Ben Bella attempted to warn him about the coup on the 16th, but Ben Bella dismissed him. \\"Marionnettes (puppets) such as them are not capable of carrying out a coup,\\" he replied.  Coup  On the evening of 18 June 1965, the leaders of the coup set the plan to remove Ben Bella in motion. That night, Boumédiène remained at his office where he supervised the coup execution that was broadly entrusted to commander Chabou, one of the first conspirators. As president, Ben Bella took residence at a place named the ‘Villa Joly’, located in Algiers. Typically, guards of the Compagnies nationales de securite (CNS) protected the compound and the guards changed shifts at 8:00pm every night; however, on 18 June Ahmed Draia, director of security, ensured that the new guards for the night shift were djounoud loyal to the military. At 1:00am, Boumédiène ordered tanks to be deployed throughout the capital at strategic positions such as Grande Poste d'Alger, Radio- Télévision Algérienne, and (the seat of the party at the time). The film The Battle of Algiers was being shot in the capital at the time, and many onlookers thought the military movement was connected to shooting the movie.Guy Sitbon, \\"Reportage de Guy Sitbon\\", Nouvel Observateur, no 32, 24 June 1965, p. 11-22 (ISSN 0029-4713). Around 1:30am, Tahar Zbiri, Said Abid, and colonel Abbes approached Villa Joly and were let in by the replacement guards at the entrance. Tahar Zbiri awoke Ben Bella, who slept on the sixth floor, and stated “On behalf of the Revolutionary Council, I have orders to arrest you on the charge of high treason.” The three military officers allowed Ben Bella to get dressed and then took him in a car to a location in the city of Maison-Carrée, 20 kilometers from Algiers, where he was placed under house arrest. Zbiri reported to Boumédiène: \\"Mission accomplished.\\" Ben Bella would remain under house arrest until 1980 and would not return publicly to Algeria until 1990. By 3:00am on 19 June, the coup was effectively over with no bloodshed.  Aftermath  On 19 June, Boumédiène broadcast a radio address which stated that the removal of Ben Bella was necessary to ensure continuity of the revolution. He accused Ben Bella of attempting to hijack the Afro-Asian Unity Conference for personal gain without regard to the other countries of the organization. Boumédiène announced that Algeria would not be able to host the conference under these circumstances but expressed his support for the ideals of the organization. However, the Pan-African Cultural Festival (PANAF) with attendees from all over the world, including the Black Panthers, would be organized by the Boumédiène administration in 1969 and held in Algiers. In the speech he also called Ben Bella a charlatan and an adventurist, possibly a reference to Ben Bella's support of Niger rebels using Algeria as a safe haven for their activity against the Diori government in Niger, something Boumédiène never supported. Another radio announcement by Kaïd Ahmed on the same day stated that the \\"instability, demagogy, anarchy, lies, and improvisation\\" of Ben Bella's government were over. On 19 and 20 June people began protesting against the coup and chanting pro-Ben Bella slogans; the new government attempted to disperse the protests, but the local police, not military elements were used to maintain order in most instances. In Algiers, between two and three thousand people roamed the streets, calling for the assassination of Boumédiène. Radio addresses repeatedly called for calm, and sometimes threatened the protesters. Several people were arrested, including 50 French far-left supporters of Ben Bella. On 5 July, Boumédiène announced the creation of the Revolutionary Council (RC) with himself serving as president of the RC, Minister of Defense, and President of the Council of Ministers. Boumédiène announced that the RC's two main goals were economic self-reliance and independent of foreign influence to the Algerian people and internally the RC sought to end regionalism, solidify the state, and to reform the wilayahs. Boumédiène's first travel abroad was in September 1965 to Casablanca at an Arab summit followed by a summit for the Organization of African Unity (today the African Union) in October. The RC began the country's first census in December at the same time Boumédiène visited Moscow for the second time in 1965. On the anniversary of the coup, he addressed the Algerian people again and reemphasized his goals to end regionalism, move progressively toward socialism, keep Algeria 'Algerian', resit foreign influence, support former freedom fighters, and remove remaining French bases from the Sahara. One year after the coup, Boumédiène pursed these goals by visiting the Eastern, Western, Tiaret, and Oasis wilayahs and progressively nationalizing industries such as mining to guard against foreign interference. He also reorganized the FLN in June 1966. In 1965, there were 2 million unemployed workers and Boumédiène pursued a realist-based policy approach to stabilize the Algerian economy, state, and society while building \\"a socialism which conforms to the realities of the country.\\"  References  ;Bibliography   Other sources  Ben Bella revient.

Once, he even pushed his young son into a barrel and threw him into a ravine, as a result of which Vladimir lost consciousness. In 1960, at the age of 14, Vladimir \\"shot\\" an adult man. After that, he repeatedly engaged in sexual relations with men and women. Later he began to attack and rape women. At the time of his arrest in 1962, when he was 16 years old, he had 13 rapes, most of which occurred in the Chernyayevsky Forest. The court sentenced him to 8 years imprisonment with a sentence in a penal colony for minors. No one touched Sulima there, as inmates were shocked by his unnaturally large sexual organ. Sulima got a good job at the colony, and the educators, affected by the size of his penis, enjoyed sexual contact with Vladimir. He spent less than half his sentence, as the management of the colony decided that Sulima was on the path of correction. In 1966, he received parole, and got a job at the Polytechnic Institute. He married, and a child was born into the family.  Murders and arrest  The first murder Sulima committed was in the spring of 1968. Near the \\"Lokomotiv\\" stadium, he attacked Galina Belonozhko, smashing her skull. Motivated by rape, he committed a further 9 more attacks, two of which ended in murder. Witnesses to one of the killings were children who were playing a war game, one of them noticing a distinct trait of the maniac - large, bulging ears. Sulima's last victim survived the attack. The day after the attack, she went to the clinic, where she saw her assailant. She called the police, but he managed to escape from the facility. However, he left behind a medical card, was identified and subsequently arrested. He immediately confessed to everything, but did not have any remorse for his actions.

It was responsible for a coup on January 2, 1931, that deposed President Florencio Harmodio Arosemena.  Ideology  The movement focused on the education of Panamanian children in the love of their country, the correct use of the Spanish language, demanding payments in balboas, and not buying in establishments that lacked Panamanian workers or whose signs were in English. The movement promoted state intervention in the economy, and the replacement of the Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty in order to retain Panamanian sovereignty in the Panama Canal Zone.  History  Acción Comunal was founded on August 19, 1923, by Ramón Mora, Víctor Florencio Goytía, José Pezet, José Manuel Quiros, Alberto Guardia Jaén, Manuel Gálvez, Enrique Gerardo Abrahams and others. The group's name was given by Goytía, and Mora became its president. The movement emerged as a reaction to the growing American influence. Initially, Acción Comunal worked as a secret society. New members registered by marking their fingerprint with blood alongside their signature. The movement had its own anthem and newspaper. In 1926, during the government of Rodolfo Chiari, negotiations were held for a new treaty (the Kellogg-Alfaro Treaty). Acción Comunal saw the treaty as disadvantageous for Panama, and they expressed their anger which spread into the general public. Harmodio Arias Madrid, despite not being a member, spoke against Chiari's decisions within the National Assembly, rejecting the treaty. = Coup of State of 1931 = Acción Comunal considered the Liberals to be the cause of U.S. dominance in Panama. When Arosemena assumed the presidency in 1928, the movement called him a puppet of Chiari, who was considered a \\"dictator.\\" On January 2, 1931, the movement conducted a coup that involved taking arms, controlling communications, taking the barracks, and assaulting the Presidency. The assault on the Presidency was commanded by Arnulfo Arias, who joined the movement in 1930. The coup was aborted by Goytía, who feared U.S. intervention, but Arnulfo Arias kept fighting. The coup resulted in eight deaths and the end of Arosemena's leadership. After the coup, Harmodio Arias Madrid assumed the presidency. While the U.S. did not intervene militarily, AC pressured for the restoration of constitutional order, resulting in Harmodio Arias transferring power to the envoy in Washington, D.C.. With the endorsement of the Supreme Court of Justice, Ricardo J. Alfaro finished Arosemena's presidential term. The coup affected the relationship between the two countries for years to come.  End of movement  The Acción Comunal had not planned for what would happen after a successful coup, dividing the movement. The movement ended up trapped between the Panamanian oligarchy and the U.S. government, who each imposed conditions and candidates. In Alfaro's government, only two or three members of the movement were in the cabinet, diluting the nationalist character. In the elections of 1932, Arias assumed the presidency, dividing the group beyond repair. Some members joined Harmodio Arias, some went with Goytía, and others remained independent, ending the movement. Some of the former members, including Ezequiel Fernández Jaén and Harmodio Arias, established the National Revolutionary Party in 1932, which later became the Panameñista Party under Arias' direction.

The service had fifty settings, and 944 pieces were ordered, 680 for the dinner service and 264 for the dessert.BM, Wedgwood Museum At Catherine's request the hand-painted decoration showed British scenes, copied from prints, with a total of 1,222 views. In addition each piece had a green frog within a shield, a reference to the name of the palace it was intended for.BM; Sweet; Flanders, Judith, Consuming Passions: Leisure and Pleasure in Victorian Britain, p. 64, HarperCollins UK, 2006, , 9780007172955, google books Most unusually for a formal royal service, it was made from Wedgwood's \\"Queen's ware\\", the firm's type of creamware or fine earthenware. Normally, large services for royalty and the top nobility were in porcelain, like the Meissen Swan Service, and an imperial order for a large earthenware service was a great coup, representing a landmark in Staffordshire pottery's conquest of European markets.McKellar; Vaizey; Sweet The great majority of pieces are now in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, where many are on display.BM Background Detail of tureen with view of Longford Castle, Hermitage Museum In 1770 the Russian navy had a decisive victory over the Turks in the Battle of Chesma, part of the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) and the Orlov Revolt, a plan by Catherine to stir up Greece against its Ottoman rulers. The overall commander was Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov, brother of Catherine's lover Grigori; both brothers had been crucial in the coup against her husband that had brought her to the throne. Another brother was present at the battle.BM Catherine decided to celebrate the victory by building the Chesme Palace. This was supposedly designed as a stopover to break the journey between St Petersburg and her summer palace at Tsarskoe Selo. Since the site chosen was only some five miles outside St Petersburg, it was perhaps not entirely necessary, even by Imperial standards, and once built was rather lightly used by the Imperial family, although it could be visited by others. The location was known as the \\"frog marsh\\" (Kekerekeksinsky), inspiring the frog device on the service. In the French-speaking court it was called La Grenouillère. The palace, or at least its unusual basic plan, was inspired by Longford Castle in Wiltshire, England. Both have a triangular main building with round towers at each corner. Longford was an Elizabethan prodigy house, but Catherine may have thought of it as Gothic architecture, in which she had a fashionable interest. Chesme Church, opposite the palace, is a startling pink Gothic Revival building, on a Russian plan, and the service depicts many Gothic buildings, including ruins.McKellar; Sweet; Historic England, \\"Longford Castle\\". Dish, ladle and saucer with \\"husk\\" border, Wedgwood, c. 1780 The service was intended for use in the palace. Catherine was interested in Britain,Sweet (\\"Catherine, an Anglophile whose devotion was never spoiled by a visit to Britain\\"); Vaizey and the role played in the battle by British naval officers such as John Elphinstone and Samuel Greig (made an admiral by Orlov during the action) may have added to the appropriateness of the chosen decoration. She had previously ordered a Wedgwood service, known as the \\"Husk Service\\", in 1770. This was also a combined dinner and dessert service in Queen's ware, but smaller, as it was for 24 settings. The painted decoration was also much simpler, with monochrome magenta-pink sprays of flowers in central zones, and borders of \\"pendant swags\\" of wheat husks, hence the name. This mostly remains in the Peterhof Palace; similar husk decoration was used on other pieces, including a service ordered by George Washington.\\"Queen’s ware Husk Service Dinner Plate – 1770\\", the Wedgwood Museum Production and display Catherine placed the new order in 1773 through Alexander Baxter, the Russian Consul in London. Views of England were requested, and the frogs. According to Llewellynn Jewitt, Josiah Wedgwood's Victorian biographer, \\"he was very unwilling to disfigure the service with this reptile , but was told it was not to be dispensed with\\".Jewitt, 211 Wedgwood's partner Thomas Bentley made the selection of views, mostly from illustrated books such as Samuel and Nathaniel Buck's Antiquities (1726–52),BM; on their works, see \\"The brothers Buck\\", Alice Rylance-Watson, British Library and the more recent Antiquities of England and Wales by Francis Grose, whose first volume was published in 1772. Other artists used were Thomas Smith of Derby, who had published engravings of his paintings of the Peak District (1760) and Lake District (1769), John Baptist Chatelain for views at Stowe House and around London, and Anthony Devis. In some cases Wedgwood commissioned paintings or drawings specially, or asked property-owners to lend theirs.McKellar; BM; GT Some pieces had views of the industrial buildings that were appearing in the British landscape,Black, Jeremy, Eighteenth-Century Britain, 1688–1783, p. 69 (end Ch. 4), Macmillan International Higher Education, 2008, , 9781137163462; Vaizey and many showed gardens in the new English landscape garden style, which Catherine was very interested in, with 17 gardens by Capability Brown depicted in the service.Brown, Jane, The Omnipotent Magician: Lancelot 'capability' Brown, 1716–1783, p. 311, 2011, Random House, , 9780701182120 It appears that the selection of views leaned towards properties owned by good customers of Wedgwood, who no doubt enjoyed the thought of the Russian court seeing their houses and gardens.Sweet Wedgwood's own house, Etruria Hall, was shown on a serving dish.GT Jars with covers, with the dessert borders, Hermitage Museum The rims were decorated with an egg-and-dart pattern, and the borders of open shapes in the dinner service with a pattern of a slightly scrolling stem bearing oak leaves and acorns. The edges of the dessert service had a similar border pattern, but only with heart-shaped ivy leaves. The edges of open shapes were slightly scalloped or \\"wavy\\". Apart from the green frog, the decoration was in a monochrome sepia.BM The pottery bodies were made and glazed in Wedgwood's Etruria Works in Stoke-on-Trent, but then taken to London to be painted at Wedgwood's workshop in Little Cheyne Row in Chelsea, opened in 1769.BM, Wedgwood Museum They were then given a lighter second firing to fix the \\"enamel\\" overglaze decoration. Over 30 painters were employed for the service.Vaizey Before shipping to Russia it was placed on display, with great publicity, in Wedgwood's showrooms in Portland House, 12 Greek Street, Soho, London, in June 1774.

Wedgwood's direct costs were £2,612, and in the end he received just over £2,700, a very meagre profit.GT But the reputational value to the firm was enormous. Some pieces were retained by Wedgwood for various reasons: trial pieces, some dessert pieces painted with the dinner border, some perhaps as the view was thought not sufficiently interesting.McKellar After delivery Plate with ruined monastery, Brooklyn Museum The Chesme Palace was not completed until 1780, well after the service was delivered, and in fact seems to have been little used by Catherine,Sweet though Jewitt records that she showed the service to the British ambassador, James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury, at the palace in 1795.Jewitt, 212 The service, though a marketing triumph, represented something of a dead end in terms of the development of English pottery, and the high-water mark of fine hand-painted earthenware. Wedgwood tried to keep together the large and skilled team of painters he had assembled for the job, but found that the prices he could achieve for pieces in even the finest earthenware were not enough to pay for complicated painted designs in the style of the service, as customers were not prepared to pay porcelain prices for them.Jewitt, 211–212 A number of pieces with variations of the Frog Service pattern (but no frogs) were made around 1774, some with views painted in colour.GT For normal commercial wares, the transfer printing method had already become the norm in English pottery for detailed monochrome decoration. This allowed a printed design to be repeated on large numbers of pieces, which could be supplemented by hand-painted colour where desired. This painting was mostly in broad washes, only requiring a relatively low level of skill, and the painters, mostly women, could be trained-up in the Staffordshire factories.Honey, 7, 116–121 Wedgwood was already producing transfer-printed wares in quantity, at this point sending them by canal to Liverpool for specialists to do the printing.Savage, 191 In the same years he was developing new bodies including his Jasperware, which by the following decade was extremely popular and much more efficient to produce. This normally used moulds and dye for a strong decorative effect, with no hand-painting needed. Wedgwood's catalogues first mention the Jasperware body, as yet uncoloured, in 1774.Jewitt, 216 Apart from the hundreds of pieces in the Hermitage Museum, there are at least five pieces in the Wedgwood Museum and a scattering of others elsewhere. Recent auction prices include $US 46,000 for a serving plate in 2009, and £14,000 (2001) and £17,000 (2004) for dessert plates.\\"Frog service remnant jumps to $46,000\\", Antiques Trade Gazette, 2009.

The dolmen was first identified in 1876, by Carlos Ribeiro, who carried out excavations until 1878 and published his results in 1880. Excavations suggest that it served as a tomb for about 80 individuals and that it dates back to the middle to end of the Neolithic period (4000-2500 BC). The Anta do Monte Abraão and the nearby Anta da Pedra dos Mouros (also known as the Anta do Senhor da Serra) and Anta da Estria are collectively known as the Antas de Belas. The burial chamber of the Anta do Monte Abraão had an east-west orientation. It had at least six upright limestone supporting stones or orthostats and three of these were found in situ by Ribeiro. The polygonal chamber had a diameter of 3.6 metres, approached by an 8 metre corridor that was 2 metres wide. Subsequent work by Vergílio Correia Pinto da Fonseca identified limited drawings on some stones. Despite the destruction of the tomb, excavations have yielded numerous finds, including stone axes, flint tools and blades, flint arrowheads, club heads, pottery ceramics, clay vessels and objects of adornment. These are exhibited at the Portuguese Geological Museum in Lisbon. Sketch by Ribeiro of the plan of the dolmen Apart from the visit by Da Fonseca, Ribeiro’s findings attracted little interest in the dolmen until the 1960s, when archaeologists became concerned about the possible destruction of the Antas de Belas as a result of urban expansion and highway construction. In addition, the Anta do Monte Abrãao was threatened by the activity of a quarry located in its vicinity. The present condition of the stones is poor and extensive graffiti is visible.

History =Construction & layout= Land in the vicinity of the village of Husbands Bosworth had been earmarked for an airbase as early as 1941, offering a well-drained and level site. Construction of the airfield was undertaken by George Wimpey & Son and commenced in August 1942 with completion scheduled for March 1943 although it was not completed until October of that year, the cost of the construction is estimated as £805,000. RAF Husbands Bosworth conformed to the layout of a typical RAF aerodrome, that is the specifications set by the British Air Ministry which called for three converging strips, each containing a concrete runway optimally placed (if practicable at the site) at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern. Gravel used to level the land was brought to the site from Kilworth Wharf on the Grand Union Canal. Thirty six dispersal places were situated around the perimeter track in addition to which the bomb store was located on the northern edge of the airfield and four main hangars also formed part of the airfield infrastructure. =Operational life= Although the final phases of construction were still being completed, the first RAF personnel arrived at the Station on 1 August 1943, when personnel from No. 14 Operational Training Unit (No.14 OTU) arrived from RAF Cottesmore subsequently being joined by additional personnel from RAF Saltby. Operational flying commenced on 10 August when daylight operations were undertaken with the first night operations beginning on 17 August. RAF Husbands Boswell came under 92 Group RAF, and was initially a satellite airfield for RAF Market Harborough under the command of the parent Station. The complement of aircraft on the Stations as of 1943 is listed as 61 Vickers Wellingtons, 4 Miles Martinets and an Avro Anson. The Wellingtons were the primary training aircraft by that time largely withdrawn from front-line operations, the Martinets would have been used for the target towing operations and the Anson would have served as the Station's communication aircraft. No. 85 Operational Training Unit On 15 June 1944 No. 85 Operational Training Unit (No.85 OTU) was formed at RAF Husbands Bosworth. The unit was formed from an element from No.14 OTU and was tasked with training crews to undertake night bombing operations. No.85 OTU was disbanded on 14 June 1945. =Closure= Following the disbandment of No.85 OTU and the cessation of hostilities in 1945 activity on the Station was reduced to a minimum and in 1946 RAF Husbands Bosworth was decommissioned by the Royal Air Force. Current use Today the former Royal Air Force Station is known as Husbands Bosworth Airfield and has been home to the Gliding Centre since 1965 and the East Midlands Air Support Unit since 1996. Following the closure of the aerodrome the subsequent release of land by the British Government, the truncated Sibbertoft Road now lies on what once was the main east-west runway.

The case was recorded in the letters of John of Salisbury, Richard of Anstey’s own diary and financial documents from the suit. The case itself was a land dispute as Richard sought to have the lands of his uncle, William de Sackville, bequeathed to himself rather than Sackville’s daughter, Mabel de Francheville. The case has received interest for its movement between secular and ecclesiastical courts, the length of the proceedings and the notable figures, such as John of Salisbury expressing opinions on the court proceedings.  The case  Following the death of William de Sackville, Richard launched a legal case against Mabel for the recovery of the lands of William de Sackville. Richard ‘claimed to be the heir of his uncle, William de Sackville, on the grounds that William’s only child, Mabel de Francheville, was illegitimate.' William de Sackville had married Albereda de Tresgoz, with both parties consenting to the marriage, before he married Mabel’s mother Adelicia (the daughter of Amfrid – the sheriff). However, Mabel did contest Richards claim asserting in a secular court that ‘a daughter's claim to her father's inheritance must be preferred to that of a nephew.’ Eventually Mabel, as the product of her father’s second marriage to Adelicia, was declared illegitimate by a ruling in the name of Pope Alexander III. However, before the verdict, Mabel contested Richard’s claim to the land. She asserted in a secular court that ‘a daughter's claim to her father's inheritance must be preferred to that of a nephew.’ As the question of William’s marriage to both Albereda and Adelicia became the fundamental crux of the case the legal proceedings were moved to an ecclesiastical court as ‘[j]urisdiction over marriage was exercised by the church courts’.[4] John of Salisbury wrote that Richard declared ‘when William went through a form of marriage with Adelicia, Albereda his previous wife protested her claim to be his lawful wife at the marriage ceremony, forbidding her supplanter by the authority of the Church to pass into the illicit embraces of her husband. Since she failed to make herself heard by reason of the crowd and the forwardness of her husband, she approached the bishop of Winchester, then legate of the Apostolic See, and as he testified by his letters, at length obtained his decree that her husband should leave his second partner and be restored to her.’ The Bishop of Winchester at the time was Henry of Winchester, who held the post between 1134–41, as papal legate held a synod to confirm this judgement. The sacrament of marriage was considered by John of Salisbury to have been fulfilled by William’s marriage to Albereda as due to the fact that their marriage ‘was done by lawful consent, she was a wife from the moment when by her promise freely given she consented to be his wife.’ However, Mabel contested this judgement as her father had married her mother ‘with all the solemn rites of the Church’ and ‘had returned Albereda’s dowry.’ The final court day was fixed by Richard for the fourth Sunday of Lent on the grounds that his legal victory was being postponed ‘by the shiftiness of a woman.’ At the proceeding Pope Alexander III pronounced Richard to be the legal heir to William de Sackville on account of William’s first marriage rendering Mabel illegitimate. ‘For Alexander III the annulment was the crucial issue, and Mabel was adjudged illegitimate.’  Lasting influence  The Anstey case ‘is familiar to historians. It has a relatively long bibliography, extending from an 1832 edition of sources to discussions in recent monographs.’ The case has significance when investigating the sacrament of marriage in the twelfth century. The judgements and opinions given on the case were made by notable religious figures, Pope Alexander III and the chronicler John of Salisbury, continue to garner interest and secure the case’s preservation in history.

Yuvan in his directorial debut. The film features R. Yuvan and Madhu Sharma in lead roles, with Shafi, Nitish Veera, Shashank, Bala, Tharsha, and Ajay playing supporting roles. The film, produced by Ghilli Sekhar and Amma Rajasekhar, features musical composed by S. Thaman and was released on 31 July 2009. The film was also dubbed into Telugu as Bheebatsam (). Plot The film starts with a flashback. The young man Aadhi (R. Yuvan) was disowned by his family and struggled to find a job in Chennai. Aadhi then fell in love with a rich girl named Gayathri (Madhu Sharma), and a month later, they got married, but later, Gayathri humiliated him and expelled him from her home because he was apathetic, poor, and could not satisfy her sexually. Aadhi then ran into his childhood friends Pazhani (Shashank) and Seenu (Bala) in a police station. Pazhani was a naive bank employee who had an unpleasant tendency to talk for hours and drove away every person within his orbit, while the jobless Seenu stole money from bar customers to drink alcohol. They started to live together and decided to make easy money: they snatched gold chains and pickpocketed. Soon, they got fed up with small amounts and decided to rob a bank. Back to the present, Aadhi and Seenu, both masked and armed, enter the bank, whereas the panic-stricken Pazhani ditches them. The two friends seize control of the bank and take the customers and employees hostage. Two of the hostages then put on their masks and shoot at Aadhi and Seenu. Police surround the bank and decide to catch the robbers, but the hostages are released at that moment. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. The police find that the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas, and 5 crores were disappeared from the bank, but no clue was left. A flashback reveals that Aadhi had roped two of his childhood friends Shankar (Shafi) and Hari (Nitish Veera), who were professional bank robbers. The five friends have successfully robbed 5 crores from the bank. Since the police are on their trail, they want to split and go to different towns by entrusting the job of carrying entire money with a single guy: Pazhani, who was not in the bank during the robbery. In the meantime, the police inspector (Ajay) is charged to arrest the culprits, and he finds that five people were involved in this robbery. The five friends do not trust each other sufficiently.

Bhama Devi Ravi of The Times Of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 and said, \\"Having drafted a neat screenplay and a solid base for the story, the director never wavers [..] treats the film as a thriller meant to entertain, which is another whiff of freshness. Neat performances by all the actors is an added bonus\\". Sify said, \\"the movie begins with a promise but fails to maintain the momentum in the second half\\". A critic wrote, \\"Though, Sindhanai Sei seems to have been inspired from a long-list of flicks, Yuvan does a brilliant job in modifying them to the tastes of Tamil audiences\\". In contrast, Behindwoods.com rated the film 1 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Sindhanai Sei has turned out to be a movie which Yuvan tried to carry on his own shoulders. But, perhaps he burdened himself a bit too much\\". For the dubbed version, Idlebrain.com rated the film 1.5 out of 5 and stated, \\"First half of the film is uninteresting.

Part of a generation of young people from Almeria seeking better opportunities in Catalonia, García and her sister moved to Barcelona to join their older brother. Initially working in a yarn factory, the events of July 1936 led her to working for a Republican munitions factory and volunteering at a hospital run by International Red Aid.. The fall of Barcelona in January 1939 made García part of the first large wave of people to flee the city towards the French border. Once arriving at the Argelès-sur-Mer concentration camp in France, García found herself pregnant in a situation where it was very difficult to give birth. With the Swiss Aid Association running the Elna Ward, García was helped with her pregnancy by Swiss nurse Elisabeth Eidenbenz. Eidenbenz inspired García to take up the same profession, and she would go on to assist over 300 women give birth in the camps. She would also assist Jewish and Polish women fleeing Nazi persecution in Vichy France by forging papers and changing names so they could more easily hide in the Spanish Republican refugee population. In 1943, García left on a Portuguese flagged ship, Serpapinto, full of Spanish refugees for Mexico to find the father of her son. After connecting with him and realizing the relationship would not work, García set about making her own way. This included going back into nursing to help other Spanish Civil War refugee women with their pregnancies, before eventually going back into the textile industry. She then settled into the quiet life. After Mexico City was hit by a devastating earthquake in 1985, García and her husband moved to Monterrey to be close to her son. She published her memoirs, Mi Exilio, at the age of 80. Starting in 2005, while in her late 80s, García would make her visits back to Spain. The first time was for a ceremony to honor Eidenbenz. The time in 2007 was to receive an award on the Día de Andalucía from the Junta de Andalucía for her work in helping Spanish women during the Civil War. García died on 3 February 2014 in Monterrey at the age of 97.  Childhood  García was born on 16 May 1916 in Albánchez, Almería into a well-to-do rural family. Her father had an adventurous spirit, which she inherited. As young person, she had traveled with her family to several Latin American countries. Her father read newspapers on a daily basis, discussing what he read with others in the town's main plaza. Both of her parents believed in free choice, secular culture and freedom of expression. They transmitted these values to their children. As a child, García attended her Townhall Republican School (). There, she picked up a voracious reading habit that would carry into adulthood. As a child, she had wanted to be a nurse.  Barcelona and the Civil War  Shortly before the start of the Spanish Civil War, the 20-year-old moved with her sister to Barcelona in 1936 to work in a yarn factory. She received her father's permission before going to Barcelona to join their older brother, and his family which included two small children. When she said goodbye to them when she left Albánchez, it was the last time she saw them in her life. Her last memory of her mother was of her sitting in a kitchen chair, crying. García became part of a generation of young people from Almeria to seek better opportunities in Catalonia. While working in the yarn factory, García also started to learn Catalan, as part of the process of better integrating into Catalan society. During her free time, she volunteered to assist the ill and infirm at a hospital run by International Red Aid. It was during this time that she learned about rudimentary emergency care. As a result of the Civil War starting in July 1936, the yarn factory García worked in was converted to a Republican weapons factory. While working at the factory, she had to deal with the daily reality of Franco allied Italian forces bombings of her city. The siege of Ciudad Condal by Franco's forces led to the fall of Barcelona on 26 January 1939. Hundreds of refugees were already in the city at the time the city fell, as they were trying to escape Franco's forces who had pushed them out of other parts of Spain early. The events around 26 January 1939 pushed an entire community into flight towards the French border. García was among those making the same decision. She became part of the first wave of refugees to leave Barcelona, when she departed in January. García was one of a half million Spaniards who would make the difficult journey to France. Her flight also made her one of 50,000 Republican Andalusians to leave Spain as a consequence of the Civil War, of which she and many others never returned.  Exile in France  = Journey = As part of the great exodus of people, García's trek to France was done alongside classmates, colleagues and friends via foot. She carried with her only a small bag with a change of clothes. The group first headed towards Girona, follow en route the whole time by Italian bombers who made it difficult to sleep. Some friends and compatriots died along the route. People traveling with them tried to gently put the dead into ditches as it was not possible to bury them. The reasons they died varied. One cause that García bore witness to was the cold. Once in Girona, García sought out an occultist to assist in removing a burr she had developed on her foot during the journey. She also had an eye infection. The occultist provided free treatment and wished her and others in her group well on their journey to France. Girona also afforded her an opportunity to eat for the first time in some days. In Puigcerdá, near the border, García met up with her boyfriend Teófilo Seaz, and friends María Gil and Angelita. The meeting was short, and the pair separated again as Seaz connected with and then traveled onward towards France with his own relatives. She eventually made it to the Argelès-sur-Mer camp. = Camp life = Refugees found themselves at concentration camps in Argelers, Sant Cebriá and el de Barcarés 7. In January 1939, the Argelès-sur-Mer camp was ringed with barbed wire, and guarded by soldiers on horseback who were trying to prevent their escape. Pregnant women were transported to stables, so they could give birth in horse stalls covered in straw. With so few options to keep babies warm, many women covered their babies in sand to keep away the cold. The only food García, Sáez and other refugees were given often was bread and salty dried cod. Conditions in the camp were very poor. While in exile in France, she received letters from her parents and sister in Barcelona. While describing life as difficult, her family discouraged García from returning. = Pregnancy = While in the Argelès-sur-Mer camp, García found herself pregnant with her partner Teófilo Sáez's baby. García regularized her relationship with Sáez, which enabled them to move to the camp in Saint Cebriá de Rosselló for married couples. If she had not done this, she feared she would be sent to the fields to work after giving birth. When she was seven months pregnant, she weighed only 45 kilos. While at the camp, she met the Swiss nurse Elizabeth Eidemberg who assisted her during her pregnancy. Eidemberg helped García give birth to her only son, Felipe. Meanwhile, Teófilo went into exile overseas in Mexico after the gendarmes came looking for him, suspecting him of being a communist. = Nursing = Healthcare at the camp in 1939 was initially served by the International Red Aid. The requirement of the International Red Aid to leave allowed the Swiss nurses to take over. The Swiss Aid Association was running the Elna Ward by1940. Swiss nurse Elisabeth Eidenbenz was part of this Swiss group, having previously served in Spain during the Civil War. Serving as part of a small group of six Swiss nurses, a midwife and a nursing ward director, Spanish women began to feel more comfortable giving birth in the camps after they learned of her presence. The Swiss being in charge in turn provided opportunities for Spanish women to volunteer more and to get access to better maternity care. Working in the ward enabled Spanish women to get access to mail from Spain, more food and more privileges. It also forced them to learn more languages. At the same time that the Swiss were in charge of delivering health services, most of the concentration camps in France were staffed by Spanish health workers. Shortly after Eidenbenz began to serve in the Elna Ward, the French government fell to the Nazis and were replaced by the Vichy government in 1940. The Elna Maternity Ward served women with a wide array of feminine identities, which merged because of a common struggle. The ward served three of seventeen concentration camps set up specifically for Spanish refugees. It later became dependent on the Swiss Red Cross, only closing in 1944 at the orders of the Nazi German government. 597 women gave birth during its existence. Meeting Eidemberg while pregnant inspired García to become a nurse. She had had little training beyond emergency care assistance prior to that. She eventually became an auxiliary nurse in the Elne Ward. As a Spanish refugee in France, she assisted other Spanish refugee women, and Polish and Jewish women fleeing persecution from the Nazis to give birth. Following Felipe's birth, she started assisting other women give birth and taking care of their young children. Her activities involved sneaking out of the camp and searching out food. She had endless hours to serve as Eidemberg's right-hand woman, saying of the experience, \\"There were no hours there, at six in the morning I was already in the cribs, preparing the diapers so that at seven o'clock the mothers would start feeding them.\\" Theirs became a vocational passion for service to save lives and to give a lot of affection.\\" García worked in the Elna Ward from 1940 to 1943, assisting in at least 300 births. Working with Eidemberg and other women in Elne, García was nearly caught by the Gestapo many times, while still managing to assist with 600 births of children who may not have survived otherwise. She also assisted Jewish women to hide from the Gestapo. García also helped by forging passports and sneaking back and forth across the border. She also helped hide Jewish women by changing names on registrations for babies, giving them Spanish names that would not attract attention from the Gestapo. For example, Samuel became Antonio and Jacob became Julian.  Exile in Mexico  After two and a half years in exile in France, in 1943,García finally decided she wanted to re-unite with her partner Teófilo Sáez in Mexico and so left on a Portuguese flagged ship, Serpapinto, full of Spanish refugees. When García arrived in Mexico, there were already 11,000 Spaniards living there in exile. The Cardenista policy at the time meant Mexico was more willing than many other countries to take in Spanish refugees. Many of the women who arrived in Mexico had young children and no resources of their own. Many would never hear news from their family in Spain again, with their families never knowing they had made a new life in Mexico. The Red Cross and Auxilio a los Republicanos Españoles assisted Spaniards in getting settled in the country. García took advantage of the Spanish refugee network of aid that existed at the time. This networked helped her in tracking down her Sáez. When García arrived in Veracruz, Mexico, after several days of searching, she found Teófilo living with another woman who was pregnant. After learning of Sáez's betrayal, García then made the decision to go it alone as a single mother. She quickly found herself living among other Spanish exiles, finding work at a maternity hospital in Mexico City where she worked as a nurse. The knowledge she learned while working in France enabled her to bring maternity practices to Mexico that were unknown at the time. It also enabled her to continue to help other Spanish political women in exile to give birth. While living in Mexico's capital, García met fellow Spanish exile José Fernández, whom she married and stayed married to for over fifty years. Later, García went back to working with textiles, slowly saving up money to try to assist her brothers to join her in Mexico. Some did make the move to the country. Her brother Juan did not, being twice condemned to die by the Francoist government for fighting for the Republican Army. His death sentence is later commuted to life behind bars thanks to efforts of another brother. Later, Juan was given special authorization to leave prison to visit the Sanctuary of Lourdes. García then tried to settle into a quiet life in Mexico City, living peacefully without attracting much attention to herself.  Retired life  While living in Mexico, García tried to live her life quietly without attracting much attention. Despite her accomplishments earlier in life, she still did not feel she had done enough to help others. Mexico City was hit by a devastating earthquake in 1985, which almost killed García and her husband. Her son was living in Monterrey at the time, and the couple decided because of the earthquake to join him in the city in order to be closer to them. In the 2000s, at the age of 80, García published her memoirs called \\"Mi Exilio.\\" In 2005, she returned to Spain for the first time since she left to attend a ceremony honoring Elizabeth Eidemberg. García was honored with a tribute by Junta de Andalucía in 2007 for her work during the Spanish Civil War, receiving the award on the Día de Andalucía. Her return at the age of 90 to accept the award was only the third time she had returned to Spain following the end of the Civil War. She was also decorated by the Almeria Red Cross at the same ceremony. She was accompanied to Seville ceremony by her only son, Felipe Sáez. She also visited her home town, Albánchez, the first time in 45 years that she had done so. García died on 3 February 2014 in Monterrey at the age of 97. Her hometown of Albanchez held a tribute in her honor after she died. Mayor Francisco Martínez explained the need to have a ceremony \\"because people like her can not be forgotten, on the contrary, they should be in the memory of everyone and especially the youngest ones\\". The event was held at the Rafael Alberti Theater.

Cocottes (or coquettes) were high class prostitutes (courtesans) in France during the Second Empire and the Belle Époque. They were also known as demi-mondes and grandes horizontales. Cocotte was originally a term of endearment for small children, but was used as a term for elegant prostitutes from the 1860s. The term was also used in Wilhelmine and Weimar Germany from the turn of the 20th century (Kokotte). Overview For some women, becoming a cocotte was also a way to achieve financial comfort before settling down in marriage. Some have managed their fortune, others have died in misery, others finally, like Sarah Bernhardt, who in the beginning was a cocotte, have become adulated actresses. For a rich man of the period, keeping a cocotte was seen as a symbol of his status and virility. Cocottes were elegant, fashionable and extravagant, the papers reported on their clothing, parties and affairs. Several authors of the 19c wrote about cocottes, for example Émile Zola with Nana. This novel describes the life and tragic fate a street-walker who rises to become a cocotte, and whose ways lead to ruin the powerful men she meets. Famous cocottes include Cora Pearl (1835-1886) (her patrons included Prince Napoleon and the Duke of Morny); Laure Hayman (1851-1932) (Paul Bourget, King of Greece, Prince Karageorgevich and Prince Karl of Fürstenberg).

The Cincinnati Museum Center, Museum of Natural History and Science is the official repository for all fossils collected by the BBPI.  Programs  The BBPI runs a 6-week field expedition each summer in southern Montana and northern Wyoming to collect fossils of dinosaurs and other Mesozoic vertebrates. Field programs generally run from late June through mid-August. These field expeditions are open to sign-ups for individuals to learn about the geology, paleontology, and natural history of the region while aiding BBPI paleontologists in collecting fossils for research. For students, the program is available as a for-credit field paleontology course through Rocky Mountain College. From 2017-2019, the BBPI also offered a dinosaur-themed summer camp program entitled “Dinosaur Treasures in Our Backyard” for children throughout rural Carbon County, Montana and in Cody, Wyoming. The program features several lessons and hands- on activities to teach children about dinosaurs, paleontology, and the fossil discoveries that have been made within their region.  Dig sites  The BBPI’s dig sites are largely within the Lance and Morrison formations, though they have also spanned through the Cloverly, Fort Union, and Willwood formations. Nearly all of the BBPI’s localities lie within Carbon County, MT. Among the BBPI’s excavation sites is the Mother’s Day Quarry which the team has been excavating since the summer of 2017.

Background  = Relationship = The victim and the murderer were both in the care of youth authorities of the municipality (German: Jugendamt), the murderer due to his status as an unaccompanied minor refugee, the victim due to a difficult family situation. Mireille B. and Ahmad S. were a couple on and off for two years in a conflicted relationship. Ahmad S. met Mireille B in early 2016 and began stalking her and tried to control her. According to witnesses, she began wearing an Islamic veil (hijab) although she did not want to. In March 2018 the conflict escalated as Mireille B. refused to wear a hijab and refused to convert to Islam. She ended the relationship and found a new boyfriend. = Contemporary society = According to official statistics, refugees constituted 12% of all suspects of violent crime in Germany.  Murder  In jealousy over Mireille B's new partner, Ahmad S. stabbed her 14 times in the evening of 12 March 2018. Ahmad S. called emergency services at 18:20 and claimed that she had attempted suicide using a knife. Paramedics arrived a few minutes later but were unable to save her life. Paramedics quickly doubted that the victim had inflicted the wounds herself. According to the emergency services, there were no traces of a struggle at the scene. Ahmad S. was taken into custody later the same day. Suspect Ahmad S. came to Germany in 2015 as a refugee from Afghanistan. In August 2015, he applied for asylum with the federal police at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof under the name Ahmad M. and claimed to be born in 1998. As an unaccompanied minor, he came into the care of Hamburg youth authorities. While in their care, he entered 1996 as his year of birth and was transferred to a reception facility for adults. He later left Hamburg and in November 2015 applied to a facility for minor refugees in Flensburg and his asylum application was later rejected. Ahmad S. had narcissistic personality disorder and he showed despair not due to mourning but over losing his control over his ex-girlfriend. He struggled to comprehend that his ex-girlfriend had broken up with him and started a relationship with another man. Trial The trial of the suspect took place in the Landgericht of Flensburg and started in September 2018. At the trial Ahmad S. claimed to be 18 years old, born 1999 in Kapisa Province. He could not understand the judge and everything in the courtroom was translated to him by an interpreter; he made use of his right to silence (German: Schweigerecht). During the trial, the age of the suspect was brought up, as this would determine whether the accused would be tried as a minor or an adult. According to a specialist in forensic medicine having analyzed the suspect, his true age was estimated to be 29. The judge accepted the proof delivered by the specialist and he was tried as an adult. The defending lawyer entered a plea of innocence on behalf of the accused. In conjunction with the defence lawyer's plea, the accused delivered a statement in his native tongue which was translated by an interpreter. In February 2019, Ahmad S. was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his 17-year-old ex- girlfriend.  Aftermath  The murder was noted nationally due to the young age of the victim and the similarities to the murder of Mia Valentin in which an Afghan refugee stabbed his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend to death in Kandel, Rhineland-Palatinate. Integration advisor Claudia Guenther criticised authorities in Flensburg which apparently had failed to anticipate his true age by not asking Ahmad S. if he had worked before arriving in Germany, as well as failing to realize that he already spoke some German when he arrived at the facility in Flensburg and therefore had likely spent a significant amount of time in the country. Authorities had also not made clear to Ahmad S. that if he gave false information over his birth country or age, it would damage his prospects of a long-term stay in Germany. Guenther also questioned fingerprints and photographs of Ahmad S. from the two asylum applications had not been compared. The murder of Mireille B was one of several murders of young women and adolescent girls noted by anti-Islamic protesters, including the 2016 murder of Maria Ladenburger in Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg and the murder of Mia Valentin, also by asylum seekers. Outside the building of chancellor Angela Merkel's office in Stralsund, anti-Islamic protesters placed funeral candles together with photos of young women who had been stabbed to death. Chancellor Angela Merkel faced criticism for her 2015 decision to open the borders to masses of mostly Muslim asylum seekers, which in turn led to the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, the anti-Islamic Pegida movement and the Identitarian movement. The murder was noted by Alice Weidel, leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Bundestag, who called the murder \\"yet another victim of the welcome-culture\\".

Bramston was baptized on 10 November 1658, the sixth son of Sir Mundeford Bramston, Master in Chancery, and his wife Alice Le Hunt, daughter of Sir George Le Hunt of Little Bradley, Suffolk. He became a clerk in the six clerks’ office in Chancery Lane, probably through the influence of his father. He married Grace Gregory, daughter of Sir Henry Gregory, rector of Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire on 7 August 1690 and may have had lodgings, near Chancery Lane as his children were christened at St. Andrew's, Holborn. Bramston was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Maldon on the family interest at a by-election on 28 January 1712. In April 1713 he became an alderman of Maldon. He voted for the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713, and was returned unopposed at the 1713 British general election. He was brought into the commission of the peace for Essex in March 1714. Bramston was returned in a contest for Maldon at the 1715 British general election In October 1715 when his cousin, Anthony Bramston and others were arrested on suspicion of being disaffected to George I, it was probably Thomas Bramston who donated ‘a sirloin of beef and a turkey’ to those imprisoned, which may account for his removal from the bench in March 1716. He was bailiff of Maldon in 1716, and 1720. At the 1722 British general election he was returned for Maldon again in a contest and listed as a Tory. At the 1727 British general election he was probably replaced by his namesake Thomas Bramston of Skreens. Bramston died on 30 May 1737, leaving two surviving sons and three daughters. Most of his estate went to his eldest son George, who married the daughter of Lawrence Alcock. A trust fund was set up, to be administered partly by Thomas Bramston of Skreens, for his daughters and younger son. His eldest daughter married the third son of Sir Herbert Croft, 1st Baronet. It took two years to obtain probate, because in spite of Bramston's role in the chancery office, his will was full of confusing obliterations and interspersed text References 1658 births 1737 deaths Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies British MPs 1710–1713 British MPs 1713–1715 British MPs 1715–1722 British MPs 1722–1727 ","title":"Thomas Bramston (1658–1737)"},{"id":"59986167","text":"John W.

It once encased the mummy of Nedjemankh, a priest of the ram-god Heryshaf.  Description  The lid of the coffin The coffin is 181 cm (72.25 in) long, 53 cm (20.875 in) wide, and 28 cm (11 in) deep. It is made of a combination of cartonnage (linen, glue, and gesso), paint, gold, silver, resin, glass, wood, and leaded bronze. The lid is covered with vignettes illustrating funerary spells, and has an inscription invoking gold and silver; inside is a figure of Nut, the goddess of the sky, partially covered with silver foil. On the base of the coffin is a djed pillar.  Provenance  The coffin is believed to have been looted from Egypt in 2011. Before its true history was known, it was purchased by New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art in July 2017 for 3.5 million euros, or about 3.95 million dollars. The museum purchased the coffin from Christophe Kunicki, a Paris-based art dealer who advertised as specialising in \\"Mediterranean Antiquities\\", particularly \\"Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Near East antiquities\\". According to the ownership history received by the Met at the time, the coffin had been exported from Egypt in 1971 with a licence granted by the \\"Antiquities Organization / Egyptian Museum, Cairo.\\" It was said to have been among the stock of Habib Tawadrus, a dealer since at least 1936, who operated Habib & Company across from Cairo's Shepheard's Hotel; a representative for Tawadrus's heirs exported the coffin to Switzerland, with a translation of the export license provided in February 1977 by the German embassy in Cairo, for use of the representative and new European owner. Egypt allowed the export of some antiquities prior to the passage of the Antiquities Protection Law of 1983. The museum believed the coffin to have remained in the collection of that family until its 2017 purchase. Return to Egypt In February 2019, the Metropolitan Museum was approached by the New York County District Attorney's Office, which presented the museum with evidence provided by the Egyptian government that the dealer’s 1971 export license had been forged. Further evidence showed the coffin had been stolen in 2011 and its ownership history was a fraud. The museum then shuttered the then-ongoing exhibition Nedjemankh and His Gilded Coffin, previously scheduled to run through April 21, 2019, and handed the coffin over to the Antiquities Repatriation Department of the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities.

Career  Criss learned the art of dressmaking from her mother and later passed on her skills by offering a program in the Richmond area for young women to develop their sewing skills. She started as a seamstress who traveled home to home, as many did. Criss became the city’s most celebrated designer in the early 1900s, charging up to $200 for her elegant, handmade dresses. With the help of her housekeeper and two or three young women, Criss designed dresses for the white elite in Richmond. Criss was well respected by her patrons and was well known for her beautifully designed wedding gowns. The second day dress, designed by Criss in 1896 and worn in the Richmond high society wedding of Miss Ellen Clark to Mr. Gordon Wallace, was donated to the Valentine Museum in Richmond, which has the second largest collection of period costumes in the United States. A wool two-part dress of Criss’s was featured at the \\"Pretty Powerful: Fashion and Virginia Women\\" exhibit in Richmond, Virginia, from May 2018 until January 2019.  Notable clients  Maggie L. Walker, the first Black woman bank founder and president of St. Luke’s Penny Thrift Saving Bank, was a neighbor on West Leigh Street in Richmond and became one of Criss’s many wealthy clients. Gloria Swanson, who was once the highest paid actress in Hollywood, was one of her more prominent clients. Criss was neighbors with Sara Breedlove Walker, better known as Madam C. J. Walker, with whom she also enjoyed a close friendship. Criss also designed dresses for Walker’s daughter A'Lelia Bundles.  Early life  Fannie Criss was born in 1866 in Cumberland County, Virginia, to Samuel and Adeline Criss, who were formerly enslaved. She was one of the couple’s seven children and their first child born after they had attained their freedom. The family later moved to Richmond where Criss listed herself as a dressmaker in the classified business section of the city directory; of the 132 women listed as dressmakers in 1902, 112 were White and 20 were Black.  Personal life  Criss married William Thornton Payne in 1895 and purchased a home on West Leigh Street, located in an affluent area in Richmond. Criss operated her dressmaking business from this location. Criss's marriage to Payne did not last long and she later married William White and the couple relocated to New York City around 1918, acquiring a brownstone townhouse in the Harlem neighborhood at 219 West 137th Street. Criss continued to operate her dressmaking business from this location, which thrived as she began to design for wealthy black women, Broadway stars and movie actresses. Criss’s flamboyant and free spirited personality made her home in New York \\"which was filled with nice furniture and lots of silver and pretty things\\" a haven for the city's most influential Blacks. Fannie Criss died on February 2, 1942, at the age of 76 in New York.
