Vasilyev also released one solo album, and sometimes assisted other groups and artists.  Life and career  Vasilyev was born in Leningrad. His father was an engineer and his mother taught Russian literature. He spent a few years of his childhood in Sierra Leone and Lithuania, where his father was sent on work assignments, before returning to Leningrad in 1980. Two years later, Vasilyev's parents transferred him to a mathematics-oriented school, where his previously outstanding academic performance started to slip and he learnd to play guitar. In the late '80s, while attending the Leningrad Avionics Institute, he met Alexander \\"Morris\\" Morozov, who would become Splean's first bass player. The two started recording at Morozov's rudimentary home studio as a band called Mitra. After serving in the Soviet army from 1988 to 1990, where he composed some songs that ended up on the first Splean record, \\"Dusty Tale,\\" Vasilyev entered the Leningrad State Institute of Theater Arts, Cinema and Music (now the St. Petersburg Theater Arts Academy) to study theater business management. He worked at theaters as a stagehand to make ends meet. Looking back at those years, Vasilyev said he was struggling to find himself and to figure out what he really wanted to do in life. \\"It was the ordinary flailing around of a young man,\\" he said. \\"I didn't set out to be a musician.\\" In 1993, Vasilyev met keyboardist Nikolai Rostovsky. Vasilyev, Morozov and Rostovsky formed Splean the following year. The band took its name from an archaic, literary meaning of the word \\"spleen,\\" with one letter changed when rendered in Latin letters. \\"In due course, the Beatles changed one letter in the word 'beetle.' As you know, it turned out well,\\" Vasilyev said. \\"The word 'spleen' is flat. 'Splean' seems to me to be multi- dimensional.\\" Over the years, Splean have experimented with changing musical genres and adjusting their playing styles from album to album. They have also undergone a few slight lineup changes. Their newer albums sound almost nothing like the first ones, an evolution that Vasilyev described as \\"searching, searching, searching.\\" References * Article by Kirill Galetski for 'The Moscow Times', Published: March 23, 2007 * Link to original article Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Russian rock singers Category:Russian male singers Category:20th-century Russian singers Category:21st-century Russian singers Category:Singers from Saint Petersburg Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Alexander Vasilyev (musician)"},{"id":"11573653","text":"Cheranand Savetanand (born October 25, 1941) is a Thai doctor and beauty queen who was Miss Thailand and second runner-up to Miss Universe 1966.

Biography Blaze was born and grew up in Cavaillon, Vaucluse. He went to Paris to study law, but also to learn music, at the Conservatoire de Paris. After having passed several more years in Vaucluse (southeastern France), Castil-Blaze moved back to Paris. A large part of his activities consisted of adapting French and foreign opera for different stages in French provinces. In these cases, Castil-Blaze adapted the libretto as well as the music. This arranging work was highly criticized, but Castil-Blaze claimed that this permitted part of the public to become familiar with opera. Castil-Blaze is mostly known as a music critic. Beginning on 7 December 1820, he published Musical Chronicles in the Journal des d√©bats, signing his articles, which were often very controversial, 'XXX'.Newark 2001. In these irregularly-published chronicles (about 30 per year), Castil-Blaze seemed to take certain liberties. Most of the chronicles criticized the lyric works, but others were dedicated to thoughts about music, to composers' necrologies (Weber in 1826, Beethoven in 1828), or to concert reviews. Castil- Blaze wrote for the Journal des d√©bats until 1832 (his replacement there was Hector Berlioz), when he joined le Constitutionnel; he also collaborated in F√©tis's Revue musicale (Paris, 1827), as well as other periodicals or reviews. He is without a doubt, in France, the first music critic to have studied music. He is the author of various books and articles on the theory of music, music history, and the history of the theater. He started a series of three works dedicated to three great lyric theaters of Paris: the Op√©ra National de Paris, the Com√©die-Italienne, and the Op√©ra-Comique. He was only able to finish and publish the first two before his death; the third remains in manuscript at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France and was published for the first time in 2012. Today, these works arouse the interest of historians, but also their distrust, because they contain numerous anecdotes that cannot always be verified. As a composer, Castil-Blaze mostly made arrangements, but he was also the author of several original works, particularly of sacred music, of which there are two high masses. Finally, he worked as an editor, first for his own literary and musical works, but he was not limited to this: he was among the editors of the works of Beethoven. He died in Paris.

He was among a class of educated elites in the early twentieth century who kept private records of their activities and who were also speakers at formal events. Many of them later published their presentations in newspapers, as this was sometimes seen as a passage into intellectual status in the western Nigerian milieu.Toyin Falola, Adebayo Oyebade. The Foundations of Nigeria: Essays in Honor of Toyin Falola. Africa World Press, 2003, p. 289. . Akinpelu's records from 1920 to 1960 became an important source for elite activities during the colonial era and is used by a few scholars on predefined topics varying from cultural, political and social history of Ibadan and western Nigeria. Included in his diaries were stories about Salami Agbaje, one of the wealthiest Ibadan citizens of his time, and socio-political matters of the era. Agbaje was the first individual to own a two-story house built from cement and the first to own a car in Ibadan. In late 1949, Agbaje was charged for selfishness by community leaders, who challenged his hoarding of wealth.Falola and Oyebode p. 294. Akinpelu and other elites also engaged in discussions and wrote about major events of the era, topics on the Lagos elites and defence of his family's land interests were major issues written and discussed about.Falola and Oyebode p. 289. Early life Obisesan was born in Ibadan to the family of an elephant hunter: Aperin Obisesan and a slave woman. His father was one of the early defenders of Ibadan against the Ijebu incursions of the late nineteenth century. He was rewarded with a chieftaincy title for his effort in defending Ibadan.Karin Barber. Africa's Hidden Histories: Everyday Literacy and Making the Self. Indiana University Press, 2006, p. 56. He also acquired a vast forest during the period. Obisesan attended various schools managed by the Church Missionary Society. The missionary school teachers were educated and frequently wrote about their activities in journals. One of the missionaries was Daniel Olubi, an early Christian convert who was Obisesan's teacher in 1896, the first year of his formal education.Karin Barber p. 56. Olubi was a mentor to Obisesan and guided him in his studies. Obisesan's impetus to keep a journal could have been established while attending the missionary schools. After completing his studies, he started work at the office of the British resident in Ibadan, but later moved to Lagos to work with the railway authority. In 1913, he returned to Ibadan and a year later, he was appointed as the caretaker and secretary of his family's land holdings. His father had used his vast forest to farm and transformed it into a productive Cocoa growing field. However, the ownership of the land was disputed, as other citizens laid claims to the land. In 1914, he bought in first diary, speculatively, he may have used his diary as a means to record events on the family's farm business or for record keeping. Career Before and after becoming the secretary of his family's farm interests, Obisesan Akinpelu was a mercantile clerk and produce buyer. While in Ibadan, he supplemented his income by working for the Paterson Zochonis group. He later became a produce buyer of Cocoa. For a span of 30 years, he was president of the Ibadan Cooperative Produce Marketing Society.Emanuel Jehuda De Kadt, Gavin Williams, Sociology and Development, Routledge, 2001, p. 125.. As leader of the cooperative produce society, he was an important voice against foul tactics used by merchant middlemen and Cocoa exporters. He also became the pioneer chairman of the Cooperative Bank of Ibadan. A bank created to serve the needs of cooperative societies in the region. Record keeping Obisesan was educated in an environment were literary skills was seen as a sign of intellectual fineness and with most missionaries situated in Lagos and Abeokuta,Karin Barber p. 60. the school age residents of the two cities had a fast start in literacy and honing their writing skills. He also believed literacy could be a ticket to acquire wealth and without education, Ibadan may be left behind. He desired writing as a way to educate himself and record keeping was a productive way of keeping himself abreast of developments in his business. In his diaries, fingerprints of his emulation of status men and being enthralled with wealth at an early age could be seen. At an early age, he dreamt about having a fecund future, however, the reality of his poor financial position was always something he moaned and wrote about early on. During his early years when he was suffering from financial deprivation, Akinpelu wrote in his diary, In 1920, when he started writing assiduously, it was a means of self-education and self-development.Karin Barber p. 62. Contents in his diary revealed different information about the social personalities and events of the era, it also revealed personal details of his life. Though, he had written in 1930 that he was fatigued as a result of numerous intercourse with his wives.,Falola and Oyebode p. 287. in 1955, he married his final wife.

Video about the Cabinet Room and the Cabinet The Cabinet Room is the meeting room for the cabinet secretaries and advisors serving the President of the United States. The body is defined as the United States Cabinet. The Cabinet Room is located in the West Wing of the White House, adjoining the Oval Office, and looks out upon the White House Rose Garden. Though completed in 1934 the room is built in the Georgian style. The neoclassical ceiling molding with triglyphs was installed in 1934. A series of French doors topped with arched lunette windows are located on the east side of the room. The light switch can be found on the wall, to the right by said doors. A fireplace, flanked by two niches is located on the north side of the room. Busts of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Antoine Houdon fill the niches. Above the mantel hangs a painting titled The Signing of the Declaration of Independence by Charles √âdouard Armand-Dumaresq, (French, 1826‚Äì1895). Additional portraits along the west wall are chosen by an incumbent president. The large elliptical mahogany table was a gift from President Richard Nixon in 1970. The president and the cabinet secretaries' chairs are copies of a late-eighteenth century design. The president's chair is centered on the table on the east side of the room. The back of the president's chair is two inches taller than those of the cabinet secretaries. Engraved brass plates with the names of the cabinet positions are attached to the back of the chairs. The president's simply says \\"THE PRESIDENT.\\" The chairs may be purchased by the cabinet members upon leaving office, in case they wish to keep the chair as a souvenir. Some cabinet members have had their chairs returned to the cabinet room for several positions and administrations. In 2006 the room was refurbished somewhat similarly to its appearance during the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt when the West Wing and current Cabinet Room were largely rebuilt following damages from a fire at the end of the Herbert Hoover administration. This includes Art Deco style wall sconces with spread eagles supporting internally lit globes. Three overhead Moderne style glass pendant lights were recreated from old photographs and a similar surviving example in a hallway between the Oval Office and Roosevelt Room. The room is painted an off-white color called deauville. A custom made carpet, in shades of carmine, old gold, sapphire and fern green with a pattern of overscaled stars and olive leaves was woven for the room. The refurbishment of White House rooms is jointly undertaken by the Curator of the White House, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, and White House Historical Association. Costs relating to construction are often funded by the White House Endowment Trust. The purchase of fine art, historic furniture, or the recreation of period decorative arts, is frequently paid for by the White House Acquisition Trust.

In Florence he also played in the orchestra of the Teatro della Pergola. In 1775 he went to Rome and played in the orchestra of the Teatro Argentina.Bartolomeo Campagnoli Ross W. Duffin, How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony (and Why You Should Care), accessed 6 July 2014. In 1776 he was appointed kapellmeister to the bishop of Freising in Bavaria. He toured northern Europe giving concerts in 1778. He obtained a post at the court of the Duke of Courland in Dresden in 1779. While retaining this post he undertook tours; he toured Sweden in 1783 where in Stockholm he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music; in 1784 toured European cities, mainly in Germany and Austria. In 1797 he published Metodo per Violino, a treatise on violin playing; it can be regarded as demonstrating the style of a transitional period between the Baroque and Classical era.Chapter 4 Dallin Richard Hansen, The Bouncing Bow: A Historical Examination of \\"off-the-string\\" Violin Bowing accessed 11 July 2014. He left the court of the Duke of Courland, and in 1797 he was appointed concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, a post he retained until 1818. He visited Paris in 1801, where he was impressed by the playing of the violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer. During Campagnoli's time in Leipzig, the violinist and composer Louis Spohr, visiting the city where he was to give a concert, heard Campagnoli play a violin concerto by Rodolphe Kreutzer. He wrote in his diary, \\"His method, it is true, is of the old school; but his play is pure and finished.\\"Autobiography of Louis Spohr accessed 10 July 2014. His two daughters Albertina and Giannetta were singers, and in 1816 he toured Italy with them. He resigned from the Gewandhaus Orchestra to look after his daughters' careers; the family eventually settled in 1826 in Neustrelitz, where he died in 1827.

They consist of eight oval-shaped lock chambers, characteristic of the Canal du Midi, and nine gates, which allow boats to be raised a height of over a distance of . The flight was originally built as an eight-rise, which together with the ninth lock (the , to the northeast) allowed boats to cross the Orb river on a level and re-enter the canal further downstream. The \\"nine locks\\" name dates from this time. Diagram of the locks and gates, showing the numbering of the chambers and the six in use at the present day. However, in 1858 an aqueduct was built to replace the crossing of the Orb. Boats now enter and leave the lower end of the flight through the side of chamber seven, which is permanently kept at its upper water level. The flight is therefore effectively made up of six locks. The lower gates of the seventh chamber are now permanently closed; the eighth chamber and the ninth lock, the pre-1858 route descending to the Orb, are disused. This side exit from chamber seven causes some confusion in describing the flight of locks. While most sources now ignore the disused eighth chamber, some still describe the flight as a seven-rise, despite chamber seven being permanently at the lower canal level. In 1983 the Fonserannes inclined plane was built adjacent to the locks, to allow commercial traffic and boats too large for the locks to bypass them. Unfortunately the project encountered technical problems, and after many years of attempting to solve them the inclined plane was abandoned in 2001. Traditional buildings such as the stables and the lock keeper's house still remain. These and the locks themselves have made the site the third most popular tourist destination in Languedoc-Roussillon, after the Pont du Gard and the town of Carcassonne. Though Pierre-Paul Riquet rightly receives much credit and acknowledgement for the creation of the Canal du Midi, we may forget that many individual parts of the canal were built by subcontractors other than Riquet.

The film was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 and since then, it was considered a cult film. This film is loosely based on Jules Verne's 1864 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne (1864) Plot Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) is a nerdy social misfit with large glasses and an intolerable squeaky voice who lives in Los Angeles and works at a diner. After being dumped by her boyfriend for \\"not having a sense of adventure\\", Wanda is informed by a letter that her father, an archaeologist, has died. She flies to North Africa and while going through her father's belongings, she finds his notes about Atlantis, apparently an alien ship that crashed millennia ago and sank into the center of the Earth. Wanda comes across a chamber beneath her father's apartment and accidentally sets off a chain of events that ultimately cause her to fall into a deep hole. An unharmed Wanda wakes up deep within the Earth to find Gus (William R. Moses), a miner whom she protects from being slain by two people. Gus, who has a very inconsistent Australian accent, agrees to help Wanda find her father, whom she believes is alive and trapped underground. Wanda soon discovers that both she and her father are believed to be spies planning an invasion of Atlantis. During her adventures, Wanda's appearance changes from nerdy to attractive (by removing her glasses and using a steam vent to clean her skin). People from the surface world are referred to as \\"aliens\\" by Atlanteans, who appear virtually identical to surface dwellers, and when Wanda is overheard talking about Malibu Beach by a low-life informant (Janie Du Plessis), she soon becomes a hunted woman and must dodge efforts at capture, both from the mysterious \\"Government House\\" and from thugs in the pay of the crime lord Mambino (Deep Roy). During these sequences, many references to Wanda's \\"big bones\\" are made, as though it were a trait by which she could be identified; however, no obvious physical distinction between Wanda and the Atlanteans is noticeable. Wanda's efforts at escape are aided by Charmin (Thom Mathews), a handsome rogue who (briefly) assists her flight and falls for Wanda. She is ultimately captured by the evil General Pykov (Du Plessis again), who wants to kill both Wanda and her incarcerated father. The Atlantean leader decides to free Wanda and her father, provided they remain quiet about Atlantis. Gus shows up and helps the duo escape while fighting off General Pykov and her soldiers. Wanda and her father board a ship that takes them back to the surface and the film ends with Wanda on the beach, wearing a bikini and a sarong. She refuses the advances of her ex-boyfriend and is soon reunited with Charmin, who inexplicably appears on a motorcycle. Cast *Kathy Ireland as Wanda Saknussemm * William R.

Most of the Namibia shoot took place in and around the old German colonial town of Swakopmund, with additional scenes also shot along Namibia's famed Skeleton Coast. The film was also shot in Los Angeles, California.

Taylor family  = = Timothy \\"Tim\\" Taylor (Tim Allen) ‚Äì Tim Taylor (the character has a birth date of October 1954) is the father of the family. Ever the know-it-all, Tim believes he has an incredibly wide knowledge of tools, electronics, and general mechanics. In reality, he is highly accident-prone. He actually does have a significant amount of skill as a general handyman, but can be overly confident and prone to spectacular mishaps. He often forgets a crucial step, ignores instructions, makes ill- advised modifications, or comes to inaccurate conclusions. The only exception to this ineptitude is when working on cars, at which he excels. He is left- handed but actually does a great deal of his work with his right hand. Taylor's \\"arch enemy\\", so to speak, is the real-life home improvement specialist, Bob Vila. One episode saw Tim competing against Bob Vila in a lawnmower contest for charity. Tim actually installed a jet engine on his machine-which resulted in Tim causing unintended chaos and destruction. Tim hosts a home improvement show called Tool Time with his co-host and friend, Al Borland. While Al is his co-host, Al constantly must remind Tim of safety regulations and practices. Tim often ignores Al's advice, and this frequently results in an accident. While it is constantly mentioned that Tool Time is a limited local home improvement show that sits very high on the channel dial, Tool Time seems to have a very wide audience in the state of Michigan, and is progressively broadcast to more outlets across the Midwest (A season 5 episode has Tim, Al, and Bud brainstorming for ideas on how to bring the show into the Chicago markets). Tim often boasts at his popularity for hosting the show, although many people state that they like Al better. A running gag involves people encountering Tim in public and stating, \\"Oh, we always watch Tool Time...we love Al.\\" To which an annoyed Tim would reply, \\"Oh yeah, we all love Al.\\" In later seasons, however, it is learned that Tim actually has a higher fan base than Al (except in a Season 8 episode, where Al scores higher than Tim on a popularity poll). Because of the numerous accidents in which he is involved, both on his TV show and at home, it is a recurring joke that Tim is on a first name basis with the hospital staff, and it is often suggested that Tim has special offers available to him for being a repeat customer. Another gag is that Tool Time fans believe his many accidents are staged, to show people what not to do. However, many of Tim's modified inventions work but are often too powerful, like his new ice cube dispenser, his leaf sucker machine, his gas powered wheelchair and his gas powered garbage disposal. Tim often garbles advice he heard from Wilson and/or otherwise makes stupid remarks ‚Äì although on one episode Tim stuns Jill and Wilson by putting forth sound advice of his own. Another running gag is Tim accidentally causing damage or destruction to anything he touches ‚Äì such as destroying the world's smallest car or running over golf carts with a Marine Corps tank. Tim has an unhealthy obsession with Halloween and Christmas, going to extraordinary lengths to scare others and competing with \\"Doc Johnson\\" in the annual neighborhood Christmas lighting contest, which he only won once, although it was more a victory for the boys as they did the decorating while Tim was out of town. While Tim has a very good relationship with his wife, he is quick to admit defeat in any conflict they become engaged in. He also works hard to maintain healthy relationships with his three sons, although he relates more closely to Brad than Randy or Mark. Tim is occasionally chauvinistic in attitude, usually putting women down or sometimes seeing them as inferior (but he often must absorb the same insults against men from Jill). A running gag is that every time Tim says something sexist on Tool Time, Al holds up a sign displaying the show's mailing address (or in one episode, the phone number) for the women to send in their complaints. He also tends to mock those who are overweight, such as Al's mother or his mother-in-law (until she loses weight), and can be juvenile in attitude on many occasions. Another running gag involves Jill's distaste for his attitude, in that she says \\"You're pathetic\\" every time he goes too far. Tim is an avid fan of all the local sports teams: the Detroit Lions, the Detroit Pistons, the Detroit Red Wings, and the Detroit Tigers. Many of the plot lines involve the teams and he often wears their memorabilia. He is also a big fan of boxing, the Indy Racing League, and tractor pulls. Many scenes take place in the garage during his favorite hobby, working on one of his two hot rods, one of which he built from the ground up, and the other existing vehicle that he restored. While he occasionally considers moving on professionally, Tim remains the main host of Tool Time until the final episode of Home Improvement. Before he was cast on Tool Time, he worked as a traveling tool salesman. Tim barely graduated from college, but later receives an honorary Doctorate from Western Michigan University. He often voices apelike grunts in a range of tones and inflections to convey emotions for comic effect, such as confusion, irritation, or pride. His mother is alive for the entire series, however his father died when Tim was eleven years old. There has always been some disparity between how many brothers Tim has. On several occasions in the later seasons, it is mentioned that Tim has four brothers, but in earlier seasons he is stated to have five, however, seven have been mentioned by name (Marty, Jeff, Rick, John, Steve, Brian, and Danny). Tim always thinks things need \\"more power\\", and is often seen wearing sweaters from Michigan-based colleges. Tim thinks he knows everything there is to know about tools. He is also very connected to his tools even once joking that when he dies he would like to be buried with them. Tim is the only character to appear in every single episode. A close second is Jill, who only missed the second part of the series finale (unless one counts the flashbacks shown). = = Jillian \\"Jill\\" Taylor (Patricia Richardson) ‚Äì Jill (born November 1956) is Tim's wife and the mother of Brad, Randy, and Mark. Jill graduated from Adams High School (taken from an actual high school in Rochester Hills, Michigan) in 1973. Jill is intelligent, practical, and has a dry sense of humor that doesn't often fly with her family. After she decides that her career is not fulfilling, Jill dedicates herself toward earning her master's degree in Psychology. While she is very motherly and domestic in nature, she is apparently a very bad cook, as Tim and the three boys often make remarks about her cooking. Her strong femininity is often in direct conflict with Tim's masculinity, occasionally leading her to wonder why they work as a couple. Jill comes from a strong military family, and sometimes uses her upbringing to solve several family squabbles. Her father was a Colonel in the US Army and is referred to as such. Jill has four sisters, all of whom have appeared: Robin, Carrie, Tracy, and Linda. (A fifth sister, Katie, was briefly mentioned by Jill's mother in the season 2 episode, \\"Much Ado About Nana\\", and in the season 4 episode, \\"Quibbling Siblings\\", but never again.) She often appears overwhelmed at the fact that she is the only female in a family with three sons and no daughter. She appears closest to her youngest son, Mark, as she remarks a few times that Mark is the only one who still has the ability to be open-minded to accept the things that Jill likes as opposed to being the typical \\"boy\\". Early on, she has a temporary job working at a magazine, and later in the series, Jill is a psychology student. She also does a significant amount of volunteer work, especially for the local library. Jill has a strong feminist side and enjoys opera, theatre, and the ballet. She occasionally tries to be interested in sports and tools but always ends up relating to her husband over his buried sensitivity. Jill also considers it her mission to get Tim, Brad, Randy, and Mark to do the right thing. Jill refers to any or all of her sons, as well as Tim by their full names when she is angry. Jill likes to \\"match-make\\", with mixed results, as she did set up Al with Ilene, who were together for a few seasons, and Wilson and one of her professors in another successful relationship. She also has a thing for cars ‚Äì driving at different times an Austin-Healey 3000 (which Tim hates because he doesn't understand British wiring) and a cherry red Chevy Bel-Air Nomad; in two memorable episodes, Jill is furious with Tim for driving her Healey without permission and for wrecking her Nomad. In other memorable episodes, Jill is extremely angry at Tim when he calls her an \\"old Hen\\" on TV and when she finds out he bought $4,000 worth of game tickets for the Detroit Pistons. = = Bradley Michael \\"Brad\\" Taylor (Zachery Ty Bryan) ‚Äì (born January 1981) is the oldest, most athletic and strongest of the three boys, once seen throwing Randy around when they got into an argument. While all three boys are portrayed as troublemakers at one point or another, Brad gets into the most serious trouble. He is the only one to have a run-in with the police (after throwing bricks at windows in an abandoned greenhouse) and was once discovered in possession of marijuana, which he admitted to smoking. On the other hand, Brad was the only Taylor son to co-host an episode of Tool Time, and the one seen doing the most extensive work on Tim's Hot Rod, and is the son to which Tim relates to the easiest. Although he often struggled with his school work, he has extraordinary athletic ability, especially playing soccer. Throughout the series, he was offered numerous opportunities to make a career out of soccer, including the offer to play for a professional team in England (the fictitious Birmingham Chubbs). This was rejected when his parents refused to allow him to give up college to play professional soccer. Later in the series, despite a knee injury which threatened to put an end to his athletic pursuits, he earned a college scholarship to UCLA. Brad has a prominent attraction to women, including his mild infatuation with Tool Time 's Heidi Keppert. Brad and Tim enjoy working on classic cars. Brad got along well with Randy, especially early on in the show. The two are often seen working together to tease Mark, attempting to cover up Brad's actions to keep him out of trouble, or just hanging out together. Brad and Mark don't share many things in common until they get older, especially in the 8th season where they develop a close bond while Randy is away in Costa Rica. = = Randall William \\"Randy\\" Taylor (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) ‚Äì Randy (born February 8, 1982) is the middle child, ultimately the smartest of the three boys, and frequently the most mischievous troublemaker. Randy's intelligence eventually led to him skipping ahead to advanced math and science classes, and was often the cause of sibling rivalry with Brad. Randy inherited Tim's talents as a jokester. Randy in the later seasons is noticeably a lot shorter than his brothers and his height is often made fun of by Brad. Whenever Tim was in trouble with Jill, Randy was always there with a quick remark that would almost always get him in trouble. Although initially sharing mostly the same interests as Brad and his father, throughout his adolescence Randy became very conscious about the environment and civil rights. He became very skeptical of the intentions of organized religion, especially Christian denominations, and became a vegetarian in later seasons. He wrote for the school newspaper, where he concentrated on social and political issues, including criticizing Binford for its pollution record, which led to a fierce disagreement with Tim and Tim's boss. Unlike Brad who dated many different girls, Randy, for the most part, only dated one girl, Lauren, whom he remained with for the rest of the series. Randy is generally the most level-headed son in the family, although because he is an intelligent boy, he was also prone to arrogance, jealousy, and sometimes a little prejudice. His father has a tendency to dislike and mock anything he has no interest in, such as ballet and opera, and Randy inherited this attitude, which ironically puts him at odds with Tim, since Randy has no interest in cars and tools. Out of all the Taylor boys, Randy is the one with the least respect for his father. He once called his father's show \\"Fool Time\\", and compared his father to an ape. When Tim brought Brad onto Tool Time, Randy immediately called it a stupid show and acted hateful towards Tim and Brad. During high school, he wrote a school article that turned many adults against Tim for Binford's pollution record, threatening his father's reputation, and he bitterly disapproved of Brad's jockish article earning the paper's front page, which was usually occupied by Randy's articles. He does however mend his relationships with them after learning the error of his ways. In the Eighth Season of the show, Randy leaves for Costa Rica (along with Lauren, who stayed in a nearby town), reappearing in only one episode when he came back for Christmas. On that occasion, Randy felt that so much had changed in his absence that he no longer fit in with the family, although confiding in Wilson aided his feelings. Unlike Tim and Brad, Randy is not good with his hands and does not enjoy working on crafts or the Hot Rod. Randy often relates more with his mother, with whom he shares his intelligence and enjoyment of acting (although Tim embarrassed Randy during one acting scene thanks to a malfunctioning stage prop). In another episode Randy's party with friends was ruined due to Tim putting on too many coats of floorwax-which resulted in his girlfriend getting a sprained ankle. Early on in the show, Brad and Randy were portrayed as \\"partners in crime\\". While they did argue like normal brothers, they generally bonded over their mutual enjoyment of teasing Mark. As they got older, they grew apart somewhat, as Randy became more focused on school and social issues and Brad became more focused on athletics and girls. Early on Randy and Mark generally only get along when united against Brad, though things improved somewhat as they got older. = = Marcus Jason \\"Mark\\" Taylor (Taran Noah SmithTV Guide: TV on DVD 2006: The Ultimate Resource to Television Programs on DVD (Macmillan, 2005), 113.) ‚Äì Mark (born March 1985) is the youngest and most sensitive of the three boys. He relates very closely with his mother, especially after the first season. He does not share many interests with his brothers or father, and in the early seasons was often the victim due to his na√Øvet√© of some practical joke that Brad and Randy had thought up on the spot for him. Mark is not a troublemaker, as he doesn't possess a joking demeanor or even a hint of a mean streak. On the rare occasions that Brad or Randy include him on pranks, Mark often blows their cover by responding to someone when he is not supposed to or divulging too much information. This divulging of information not only gets Brad and Randy in trouble, but often Tim as well, especially when he is trying to keep something he said or did from Jill. During adolescence, Mark began to adopt a more \\"goth\\" look and an anti-establishment kind of attitude, the cause of which was founded in his feelings of social isolation. While Mark's darkening demeanor worried Tim and Jill on several occasions, it never turned into anything extremely destructive, although a homemade horror movie he created was a bit more twisted than they expected. His Gothic appearance was gone by the end of the series. Mark enjoys film production and music, took karate and pilot training, and became a proficient cook. During the early seasons of the show Mark is seen in a Cub Scout uniform-sans badges. Mark's relationship with Brad and Randy was often adversarial, especially in early seasons as he was often the butt of their jokes, pranks and teasing. While Mark never truly bonded with Randy, in the final season Mark and Brad grew very close as the result of the dynamic of their relationship changing when Randy left for Costa Rica. Mark eventually became taller than Randy in the seventh season. = = Martin \\"Marty\\" Taylor (William O'Leary) ‚Äì Marty (born in 1964) is Tim's youngest brother by ten years. As their father died when Marty was just one year old, Tim is the closest thing he knows to a father. Marty was often picked on by his older brothers, much as Mark is by Brad and Randy. He is often seen bouncing from job to job, unable to hold a steady career. For the majority of the show's run, Marty was married to Nancy (Jensen Daggett), and they had identical twin girls, Gracie and Claire. = = Jeffrey \\"Jeff\\" Taylor (Thom Sharp) ‚Äì Jeff is Tim and Marty's oldest brother (exact age unspecified). He is extremely frugal and suffers from male-pattern baldness, both of which make him a frequent target of Tim's jokes. Like Marty, Jeff has trouble maintaining a steady job. It is mentioned that he has made a number of bad business ventures (such as a drive-thru pet store), was divorced twice, and didn't finish college (as mentioned by Jill's sister in one episode). Jeff eventually makes an investment in Tim's hardware store.  Friends of the family  = = Albert E. \\"Al\\" Borland (Richard Karn) ‚Äì A master plumber and licensed contractor, Al is Tim's un-hip co-host on the show-within-a-show Tool Time and best friend. His personality is an exact opposite of Tim's ‚Äì he is reserved, quiet, does not show much enthusiasm and has a wide array of professional knowledge concerning tools. Al made frequent suggestions that he should be the host of Tool Time instead of Tim. Al does not make as much money as Tim, in fact it is implied that his salary is not very big at all. In the episode, \\"Brothers and Sisters\\", Al says that he gets a very small paycheck. In the episode, \\"Fifth Anniversary\\", it is revealed that a big reason why Al was chosen to be Tim's assistant was because Al was the only assistant applicant that was willing to work for the salary that was offered. Al could be characterized as a \\"mama's boy\\"; he spent a great deal of time attempting to please his mother Alma ‚Äì who was severely overweight (though she was never seen). She died from a heart attack near the end of the series after Al asked her permission to marry Trudy. His father was almost 60 when Al was born. Al was engaged to an orthodontist named Ilene for a time, but they ended up calling off the wedding. He also dated Greta Post who appeared a few times in the series. In a later season, Al met a wealthy exterminator named Trudy. They hit it off and were married on the show's final episode. Al might have been based on Norm Abram of This Old House because of the resemblance (flannel shirts, beard, portly, etc.) and the fact that Al does all the \\"real work\\" on the Tool Time show (much like Norm did on This Old House). In the episode \\"No, No, Gadot\\", Tim and Al were arrested for scalping hockey tickets. In a holding cell, an inmate named George approached them and asked if they were \\"the guys from that TV tool show\\", and Tim responded with \\"why, yes, I'm Bob Vila, and this is Norm\\". Al has a big brother named Cal who is a physicist, and unlike most male siblings, they had never gotten into a physical fight. Instead, they usually settled their disputes over a cup of tea. In a flashback episode of the Tool Time premiere, Al was noted to be a Pisces and had a clean-shaven face, while Tim had a beard. Al has his own fan club. Like Tim, Al is left- handed and his favorite board games are Parcheesi, Chinese Checkers, Scrabble and Bingo. His favorite movie is My Fair Lady. One episode had a pet of Al's, a turtle named \\"Scooter,\\" which Tim accidentally dropped in cement. With his dry wit, Al serves as the show's (both Tool Time and Home Improvement) straight-forward, practical man to the wackier, more outgoing Tim. Beginning at the end of the fifth season, Al invented a second source of income for himself by inventing a board game based on Tool Time, which features Tim, Al and Heidi as playable characters. When people watch tool time, the fans love Al.  Family, fashion sense, and career  Borland is slightly overweight, and almost always seen wearing flannel, which Tim cracks jokes about consistently. The reason he always wears flannel came from his father, who, when asking young Al to assist in their own various home projects, would put his old flannels on Al to keep him clean or warm. Al wears flannel as a tribute to him after he died. Tim also often pokes fun at Al's mother, Alma Borland, who is never seen (except her hand and forearm, in season 8), but is apparently severely overweight. In one of the later episodes, Al announces to his mother he is getting married. Immediately afterwards, she screams, passes out, and dies (she was holding a breadstick, which was all that was seen). When hearing the news, the breadstick shook violently and fell over. The coffin, shown at her funeral, is double-wide to keep the humorous tone. Al also has a brother, Cal, who looks and dresses almost exactly like him, though he is a physicist (\\"Sisters and Brothers\\"). In the episode commentaries featured on the Season 1 DVD Set, the executive producers reveal that \\"Cal\\" was a fan from Texas who sent his photo in a fan letter. Upon seeing his resemblance to Al, the producers brought him in to be Al's brother, Cal. When Al was younger, he took fencing in school and served in the Navy as a Lt (j.g.) with the Seabees, and although he wanted to see the world, he was stationed in Fallon, Nevada (in the episode where Al mentions this, he uses the shibboleth pronunciation of \\"Nevada\\", which is uncommon for an outsider, especially someone living in the midwest). After finishing his military service, Al was a construction crane operator (AFL‚ÄìCIO Local 324), then apparently got certified as a master plumber and carpenter before getting the job on Tool Time. Al drives a 1984 Mercury Colony Park station wagon (mistakenly identified as a Mercury Marquis wagon on the series) which his mother passed down to him, and has put much time and effort into preserving the vehicle. While Al has similar interests such as cars, he has some rather odd interests, such as being able to deduce different types of wood by smell rather than appearance or texture. Al gets along well with Tim's sons. However, just like Tim, Al has faced problems and needed to seek the advice of Wilson. Outside of his job, Al has made investments such as becoming part owner of Harry's Hardware and marketing a successful board game based on Tool Time, the object of which is to avoid hospitalization.[Tanks For the memories Season 5/15]  Al's beard  Al's beard is also a constant joke by Tim. In one episode where Tool Time is celebrating their fifth anniversary show, Al is shown in the first ever episode of Tool Time clean shaven, while Tim has a beard.  Al's knowledge of tools and home improvement  He generally knows what he is doing more than Tim, and he seems to have a better knowledge of tools and home improvement than Tim. In the first episode of Tool Time, he was described as a \\"master plumber\\" by Tim Taylor. He also is very serious about his job, unlike Tim, who often jokes and messes up the project. Al often speaks fondly of his time as a U.S. Navy Seabee. Although Tim is the one who messes up most of the projects on Tool Time, Al is often the one who is blamed for the mishap, or is injured by the mishap. On rare occasions Al would cause a mishap of his own, but these were more due to overcalculating than Tim's attitude of \\"more power\\". Despite this, Tim and Al are good friends offstage, and Al often helps out, either by helping with home projects, or by watching his children.  Romantic Relationships  Throughout the series, Al has had four different sweethearts. In season one, Al went out with Greta Post, whom he met while she was volunteering to help out during a Tool Time show. Al then showed an interest in Jill's friend Karen, but when he learned she was seeing another gentleman, Al took it well and rebounded. He almost went out with Tim's ex-girlfriend Stacey Lewis, however, he wasn't interested in her as much as he thought. From seasons three through five, Al went out with Dr. Ilene Markham, an orthodontist who was the sister of one of Jill's co-workers. They got engaged, but they decided at the wedding to part ways. Al met a woman named Trudy in season seven and married her in the finale episode in 1999.  Running gags/quirks surrounding Al  * His overweight and overbearing mother. * Giving the Tool Time viewing audience a salute at the start of each airing at his introduction. * Tim jokes about Al's mom \\"looking for a smorgasbord\\". * He is always wearing flannel. He is often shown backstage at the Tool Time set, taking off his shirt and changing into a flannel shirt that is identical to the one he was just wearing. * His beard. * His higher popularity over Tim * His love of Bingo. * His fanatic admiration of fellow home improvement television host Bob Vila. * Whenever Tim suggests doing something particularly stupid, dangerous or both, Al replies in deadpan fashion, \\"I don't think so, Tim\\". * When Tim would make a particularly sexist or otherwise offensive remark, Al would hold up a large sign with Tim's mailing address and say, \\"That's Tim Taylor, care of Tool Time, PO Box 32733, Detroit, Michigan, 48252\\" Sometimes Tim will rip the sign half-way in his sentence, but Al would just pick up another sign and finish. * His often unlucky relationship with women, despite (or possibly because of) him being more sensitive than Tim. = = Wilson W. Wilson, (Earl Hindman) ‚Äì Tim's neighbor and confidant. As a child, his parents did not allow him to speak to his neighbors, so he really likes talking to Tim and Jill. Wilson serves as an all-wise sage in the show, doling out advice to the Taylor family and seemingly always knowing just what to say to solve a problem. While most of his appearances were to help the Taylors, on seldom occasion someone who was in the extended family, or a nonmember, such as Al, would seek out Wilson's advice. He has traveled the globe and learned much from virtually every culture in existence. He has a Ph.D. in Cultural Studies, studying \\"extinct languages and forgotten cultures.\\" His house is full of artifacts along with a pet myna bird named Mozart who appeared infrequently. Wilson was married at one point, but his wife Catherine died long before the series begins (in a November 1994 episode, Wilson revealed that that month would have marked his and Catherine's 25th anniversary). At first it was unclear whether \\"Wilson\\" was his first name or last, but his full name is revealed as Wilson Wilson, Jr. In Season 6, it is revealed that his cousins are the Wilsons of The Beach Boys. He has a grown niece named Willow Wilson (China Kantner), who appeared regularly in the seventh season when she moved in with him for a while. His usual greetings are \\"Well, hi-dee-ho ...\\" or \\"Hi ho, there neighbor\\" or \\"good neighbor\\" when greeting Tim, \\"neighborette\\" when greeting Jill, and \\"Taylor lad(s)\\" when greeting the Taylor boys. A visual gag is that throughout the entire series Wilson's face is never shown in its entirety, originally (and most commonly) with the bottom half obscured by the tall privacy fence that separates the neighbors' yards; this was based on how Tim Allen saw a next- door neighbor when he was growing up. This gag is extended over the course of the series with other objects (or a beard) obscuring the bottom of his face, or the bottom half showing but the top obscured (such as by a mask), or his full face shown but covered by paint. The audience finally sees Earl Hindman's full face unobscured in the series finale's curtain call. = = Lisa (Pamela Anderson) ‚Äì Binford's first \\"Tool Girl.\\" A secondary cast member on Tool Time, Lisa's job was to introduce Tim and Al and to hand them any tool they requested. When Pamela Anderson chose to leave Home Improvement to pursue a role on the syndicated series Baywatch, she was written out of the series after Season 2 and it was stated that Lisa was training to be a paramedic. Lisa returns for a guest appearance four years later, having become fully qualified; and applies for (and gets) a job at Detroit Memorial Hospital . = = Heidi Keppert (Debbe Dunning) ‚Äì The second \\"Tool Girl\\" (beginning in Season 3, series regular in seasons 7-8) and a master electrician. Initially, the character was seen only in and around the Tool Time set. In later seasons, her personal life increasingly crossed paths with Tim and Al. She gave birth to a daughter (Amy) and suffered marital problems during the show's run. In Season 8 Episode 24 (Dead Weight), Heidi reveals to Tim that her breasts twitch when she is nervous. In the last episode of the series, Heidi revealed she was pregnant for a second time. Despite her credentials, Heidi was also \\"eye candy\\" for the male audience on \\"Tool Time\\", as the outfits she wore typically showed off her figure, particularly her legs and ample cleavage; Tim speculated that many men came to the show just to see Heidi. It is revealed in multiple episodes that Tim's son, Brad, has a crush on her. In seasons seven and eight, Dunning's role on Tool Time became such that she was eventually given main cast billing in the opening credits. = = Harry Turner (Blake Clark) ‚Äì Owner of \\"Harry's Hardware\\", where Tim spends a great deal of his time and money, and in which Al eventually became part owner. He is one of Tim and Al's buddies. He is not-so-happily married to his wife Delores (Shirley Prestia), and the couple incessantly bad-mouth one another behind their respective backs, as well as occasionally to each other's face. Harry has four sons, including Dennis (David DeLuise), with whom he has a somewhat rocky relationship, but they reconcilled. In one episode Harry tells Tim that he has gotten a vasectomy. In another episode it is mentioned he served in the United States Marine Corps in the Vietnam War (Blake Clark actually served in Vietnam as an Army officer). = = Benny Baroni (Jimmy Labriola) ‚Äì One of Tim's buddies who hangs out at the hardware store. Benny is a bit of a slacker and notoriously known as a freeloader ‚Äì his trademark being drinking coffee and eating donuts. Benny has not had a job in years, mainly because he doesn't like to work. He makes money by gambling and betting on horse races. On one episode (\\"A House Divided\\", Season 4.18) While the \\"Tool Time\\" crew is fixing up Benny's aunt's house, the structure is blown up due to Benny's negligence and is not Tim's fault; furthermore when Tim and his family are moving furniture back into the twice repaired Benny's aunt house, Benny, rather than helping out, lies back on a lawn chair to watch the others do the work. He is also known for being inconsiderate of others; at one point, he even ate at a soup kitchen regularly to avoid paying for meals. One episode (\\"The Look\\", Season 5.07) Tim was selling season Pistons tickets (Tim had 2 tickets for each game and each pair cost $100) and Benny not able or willing to buy any of the tickets kept offering to go to the games with the people who were buying them, even people he didn't even know, so he could go to the games without paying for a ticket. Ironically in a rare instance of performing earnest work, Benny once appeared on an episode of Tool Time for \\"Tim and Al's Fantasy Kitchen\\", where he was shown cutting meat inside a walk-in freezer.  Other recurring characters  * Karen (Betsy Randle) ‚Äì feminist friend of Jill who is very obnoxious towards Tim, often helping Jill mock and discourage Tim. Tim finds her irritating. While she finds her rivalry with Tim innocent and harmless, she has no qualms passively accusing Tim of being unfaithful, making Jill feel insecure about their marriage. Moved to California after Season 2 - this coincided with Randle starting her regular role of Amy Matthews on Boy Meets World, another ABC sitcom. * Ilene Louise Markham, D.D.S. (Sherry Hursey) ‚Äì an orthodontist, and Al's first serious girlfriend. On their wedding day, she and Al mutually agreed not to get married and ended their romance on a positive note. Her last appearance was in Season 6. * Marie Morton (Mariangela Pino) ‚Äì neighbor of the Taylors; close friend of Jill. * Joe Morton (Robert Picardo) ‚Äì Marie's overactive and obnoxious husband; the \\"meat man\\" who irritates Tim, until Morton finds a hard to find jalopy replacement part for Tim; ran out on Marie in Season 5 - this coincided with Picardo's taking the role of \\"The Doctor\\" on Star Trek: Voyager. * Jennifer Sudarsky (Jessica Wesson) ‚Äì Brad's first love interest who always called him \\"Bradley\\", later moved to Ohio. * Angela (Kristen Clayton) ‚Äì Former girlfriend of Brad, known for being a constant motor-mouth. She dumped Brad for a guy with his own car. Brad suffered from a bout of depression because of this, but eventually rebounded. * Ashley (Leigh Ann Orsi) ‚Äì girlfriend of Brad, went to boarding school from Season 5 onwards * Beth (Anndi McAfee) ‚Äì Randy's first girlfriend who left town * Lauren (Courtney Peldon) ‚Äì Randy's tomboy girlfriend, left for Costa Rica with him in Season 8. * Lillian \\"Nana\\" Patterson (Polly Holliday) ‚Äì Jill's mother. Before Lillian's first appearance, she was joked at by Tim as being largely overweight, though in her first appearance, Lillian has become thin again, having used Tim's jokes on Tool Time as motivation. Lillian speaks with a very notable Southwestern accent and is caring and supportive to Jill whenever she has troubles. * Colonel Fred Patterson (M. Emmet Walsh) ‚Äì Jill's father, died in his sleep from a heart attack in Season 6. He had a long career in the Army and his favorite movie was Patton. He somewhat got along fine with Tim, but didn't particularly respect him. He never called Tim by his name but instead called him \\"Hey You\\". * Delores Turner (Shirley Prestia) ‚Äì Harry's overbearing and demanding wife; a New York Knicks fan who can devastate men with \\"The Look\\". Her worsening asthma causes Harry to sell the hardware store and move to Arizona in Season 8. Delores and Harry are shown to constantly be arguing whenever they are seen together. Delores is shown several times to work at a local coffee shop as a waitress, where she continues to be sharp-tongued to customers * Nancy Taylor (Jensen Daggett) ‚Äì Wife of Marty Taylor. They are separated in Season 8. * John Binford (Noble Willingham) ‚Äì founder of Binford Tools, died early in Season 3. * Maureen \\"Producer\\" Binford (Vicki Lewis) ‚Äì John Binford's overeager and annoying daughter, she ran Tool Time for a brief time during Season 2, constantly reminding Tim in a sing-song voice that she was the Producer of the show, which allowed her to cause many changes to the show that Tim hated. * Trudy McHale (Megan Cavanagh) ‚Äì an electrician and heiress to her family's fortune whom Al married in the final episode. * Cal Borland (Keith Lehman) ‚Äì Al's brother, a physicist. * Felix Myman (Al Fann) ‚Äì professional plumber and frequent participant in Tool Time's projects. * Rock Flanagan (Casey Sander) ‚Äì construction worker at K&B; Construction. Somewhat loud, and charismatic, Rock always responds to guest appearances on Tool Time by saying, \\"It's always great to be here, Timmy!\\" In K&B;'s \\"all-tool band\\", his instrument is a grinder run over an empty oil drum. * Dwayne Hoover (Gary McGurk) ‚Äì construction worker at K&B; Construction. The \\"straight man\\" of K&B;, he always has to interrupt Pete whenever he is about to say a story that is too revealing by saying, \\"This is not the time, nor the place!\\" In K&B;'s band, he plays hammers on an anvil. * Pete Bilker (Mickey Jones) ‚Äì construction worker at K&B; Construction. Whenever he is called by name from Rock, Pete usually responds, \\"That would be me.\\" In K&B;'s band, he plays empty plastic fuel cans as drums, using screwdrivers as drumsticks. * Carrie Patterson (Tudi Roche ‚Äì the real-life wife of Richard Karn), Jill's sister, a world-traveling photographer. * Willow Branch Leaf Wilson (China Kantner) ‚Äì Wilson's laid back niece, just goes by Willow, saying she \\"pruned it back\\". * Lucille Taylor (Bonnie Bartlett) ‚Äì Tim's widowed mother. * Bud Harper (Charlie Robinson) ‚Äì head of Binford Tools, Tim's boss. Bud interacts a lot with Tim and Al, even offering Tim season tickets to the Detroit Pistons. He does not particularly respect Al, even at one point suggesting Al get fired, however Tim defended Al from this. * Jason (Jarrad Paul) ‚Äì Eddie Haskell-like friend of Brad, often claims to be a fan of Tool Time even though he's never actually seen the show and gains favor with Tim by pretending to ask for advice about tools. * Samantha Hayes (Maggie Lawson) ‚Äì A college student who dated Brad, although she was four years his senior, which troubled Jill and Tim. In one episode, she and Brad impulsively decided to get married at their young age, but Tim and Jill successfully tricked them to realize their mistake. * Patty (Tammy Lauren) ‚Äì Jill's friend in season six and seven * Morgan Wandell (Danny Zorn) ‚Äì The new producer of Tool Time during the final season.

It is now believed that Riedel's thyroiditis is one manifestation of a systemic disease that can affect many organ systems called IgG4-related disease. It is often a multi- organ disease affecting pancreas, liver, kidney, salivary and orbital tissues and retroperitoneum. The hallmarks of the disease are fibrosis and infiltration by IgG4 secreting plasma cells. Pathophysiology Riedel's thyroiditis is characterized by a replacement of the normal thyroid parenchyma by a dense fibrosis that invades adjacent structures of the neck and extends beyond the thyroid capsule. This makes the thyroid gland stone-hard (woody) and fixed to adjacent structures. The inflammatory process infiltrates muscles and causes symptoms of tracheal compression. Surgical treatment is required to relieve tracheal or esophageal obstruction. Diagnosis Diagnosis is done by biopsy Treatment Therapy usually consists of prednisolone, nonetheless some cases may require surgery. Tamoxifen has been proposed as part of a treatment plan. Treatment is directed to surgical relief of compressive symptoms. Tamoxifen may also be beneficial. The type of surgery which is indicated here is isthmectomy. Prevalence Riedel's thyroiditis is classified as rare. Most patients remain euthyroid, but approximately 30% of patients become hypothyroid and very few patients are hyperthyroid. It is most commonly seen in women.eMedicine Eponym It is named for Bernhard Riedel. He first recognized the disease In 1883 and published its description in 1896.B. M. C. L. Riedel.

He taught philosophy at Ritsumeikan University and was subsequently appointed president of the Kyoto City University of Arts. He is noted for his prolific essays on Japanese culture, in which he has endeavoured to refound the discipline of Japanese studies along more Japanocentric lines, notably in his book written in 1972 in collaboration with Shunpei Ueyama. Aside from his voluminous academic essays on numerous aspects of Japanese culture he has also composed theatrical works on figures as varied as Yamato Takeru and Gilgamesh. He was appointed in 1987 to head the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, otherwise known by the abbreviation of Nichibunken, established by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to function as a centralized academic body collecting and classifying all available information about Japanese culture, both within Japan and abroad. He retired as head administrator of Nichibunken in 1995. Early years His mother Chiyo Ishikawa died early while Umehara was being breast-fed, and his father was still a student at Tohoku University. Arrangements were made to have him looked after by relatives, and over New Year 1927, aged 1 year nine months, Umehara was adopted by his father‚Äôs brother Hanbei Umehara and his wife Toshi, and raised as their foster child. Throughout his education, from primary through to tertiary level, Umehara was by his own account an indifferent student. He was in his primary school years somewhat of a daydreamer, preferring play to study. After graduating from Tokai High School in Nagoya, he gained entry in 1942 to the Hiroshima Higher Normal School, but withdrew after only two months, and, in the following year, the managed to obtain a place at the Hachik≈ç (Eighth Rank) High School in Nagoya, under its Principal It≈ç Nikichi (‰ºäËó§‰ªÅÂêâ). Over the following two years he developed a passionate interest in the philosophies of Nishida Kitar≈ç and Tanabe Hajime, the intellectual leaders of what was known as the Kyoto School (Ky≈çto Gakuha), a circle of conservative modernists who gave substantial theoretical backing to Japan‚Äôs imperial outreach during the period known as the 15-year war. Umehara was also attracted by the philosophy of ethics being worked out by Nishida and Tanabe‚Äôs former colleague, Watsuji Tetsur≈ç, who had now shifted to Tokyo University. Reading their work made Umehara resolve to dedicate his life to philosophy.Umehara Takeshi, Nihonjin no„Äåano yo„Äçkan Ch≈´≈çK≈çron, Tokyo, 1991 p.164 On graduation from his secondary schooling, Umehara won a place at Kyoto University.

At his son‚Äôs insistence, however, he relented and gave his permission.

Career A sample of Luis Garc√≠a's work, from Vampirella #42 =Early career= More widely known in English as just Luis Garc√≠a, he was born in Puertollano, Spain in 1946. Garcia moved to Barcelona at the age of 10 to focus on his art and became an art apprentice at Editoria Bruguera at the age of 13. In 1961, he joined the well known Spanish agency Selecciones Illustradas and started drawing western and romance comics that were published in Britain. Six years later he joined a group of fellow artists Esteban Maroto, Ramon Torrents, Suso Pena and Adolfo Usero Abellan, who created the series 5 x Infinity. = Work for Warren Publishing= In 1971 Garc√≠a joined Warren Publishing, where he drew nine stories for Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella. Garc√≠a's first story published for Warren, The Men Who Called Him Monster (Creepy #43, January 1972) is notable as having the first interracial kiss in mainstream comics. Ironically this kiss, which occurred between a black detective and a white teenager he was interviewing happened only because the translator misunderstood the line \\"This is the clincher\\" in writer Don McGregor's script. Another story of Garc√≠a's, Welcome to the Witch's Coven (Vampirella #15, January 1972) won the Warren award for best art in a story for 1972. After meeting artist Salvador Dali in 1972, Garcia would bring his Warren work to Rene Goscinny, director of the French magazine Pilote where he was recruited to work for the magazine. Along with writer V√≠ctor Mora, he created the series The Chronicles of the Nameless. Five of these stories would be reprinted, in rewritten form, in Vampirella in 1975 (Around the Corner... Just Beyond Eternity!, The Wolves at War's End, Love Strip, Janis and The Secret Legacy of Gaslight Lil!). The Wolves at War's End was rated as the second best story to ever appear in a Warren magazine by David A. Roach, co-author of The Warren Companion. Love Strip also appeared on his list in tenth place. The Wolves at War's End would later also be published in Heavy Metal under its original title and original storyline, The Winter of the Last Combat. =Later career= Garc√≠a's art would later appear in La Isla del Tesoro (1977), La Gran Aventura (1978), Etnocidio (1979) and Chicharras(1985). In 1980, Garcia would produce the series Nova 2, which focuses on a comic book artist's attempt to kill himself. The series would later be published in English in Heavy Metal magazine. Along with artists such as Jose Bea, Alfonso Font, Adolfo Usero Abellan and Carlos Giminez, he was one of the founders of the magazine Rambla. All of his co-founders except for Jose Bea would soon depart, but the magazine ran for 40 issues. After Rambla went out of business in 1985, Garc√≠a ended his career as a comic book artist to focus on painting.

Retrieved October 6, 2009. He grew up as a fan of the only professional major league team in his home state of Oregon, the Portland Trail Blazers, regularly attending games with his father. Following his graduation from West Albany High School, Barrett attended Oregon State University (OSU), located about 10 miles away in neighboring Corvallis, Oregon. He graduated from OSU in 1991 with a degree in Journalism. =Broadcasting career= Mike Barrett interviews Blazer Center Joel Przybilla in Portland at the time of his 2006 free agent signing. After graduating from Oregon State University, Barrett went to work for radio station KUIK-AM 1360 in Hillsboro calling high school basketball games. He became sports director at KXL-AM 750 in Portland, then the flagship station of the Trail Blazers, in 1992. While at KXL Barrett anchored the station's morning and afternoon sportscasts as well as working as a sideline reporter for University of Oregon football broadcasts. In 1999, he was hired by the Portland Trail Blazers as radio studio host and editor of the Blazers' official magazine, Rip City Magazine. The next year, he went to work as a radio and television play-by- play announcer for the WNBA's Portland Fire, a role which he continued until the team disbanded in 2003. Barrett was named the play-by-play announcer for the Trail Blazers for the 2003‚Äì04 season, working for the first two years next to Steve \\"Snapper\\" Jones. From the 2005‚Äì06 season he was joined by analyst Mike Rice on Blazers' telecasts, an assignment which often caused him to assume the role of straight man for his loquacious and unrestrained broadcast partner. Barrett has said of his partner: > \\"Rice is good, he's a character, and you strip away some of that cartoon > character, and I'm so lucky to work with him. I think his calls are probably > as memorable as anything I say. I like to give him that room. Some of the > traditional broadcasters really want their own space, who get upset when > their analyst gets in and steps on their call. I'm not into that. I want to > be there to fill in the blanks and to provide some information and > entertainment.\\" In addition to calling the play-by-play, Barrett and Rice frequently appeared on a weekly radio and television show, Trail Blazers Courtside. Barrett also wrote voluminously for his blog on the Blazers' website, offering game reviews and a behind-the-scenes perspective on the team. Barrett recalled the origins of his on-line publication in a 2008 interview: > \\"The funny thing is that when the blog started at Summer League like 3 or 4 > years ago, they said write some stuff for training camp, and that was kind > of strange, but then they saw I could write in a real conversational way, > that involved people.

History Seagull was laid down as YMS-402 on 24 July 1942 by Henry B. Nevins, Inc., City Island, Bronx; launched on 17 April 1943; and commissioned on 26 June 1943, Lt. (JG.) J.W. Gaines, USNR, in command. In mid-August 1943, YMS-402 reported for duty in the Eastern Sea Frontier. For the next year, she operated out of the Naval Frontier Base, Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York. On 28 August 1944, she departed that base for San Diego, California, and duty in the central Pacific. Arriving at Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, on 20 November, the motor minesweeper, as a unit of Mine Squadron 102, remained in the Marshall-Gilberts force for the next nine months, conducting local minesweeping, escort, and patrol operations, and making an occasional escort into the Western Carolines. After the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific, she prepared for postwar minesweeping activities; and, at the end of August 1945, she sailed for Okinawa and Japan. During the fall, she participated in the opening of Nagoya and Wakayama; and, with the new year, 1946, she headed back to the United States. After stops in the Marshalls and in the Hawaiian Islands, she arrived at San Pedro, California, in early April. She remained on the west coast into the summer; and, at the end of June, she sailed for New York, where she was decommissioned on 1 August 1946. Placed in service again, YMS-402 departed New York on 30 October and moved north to the St. Lawrence, whence she proceeded to Buffalo, where she served as a naval reserve training ship until after the outbreak of war in Korea. Named USS Seagull and redesignated AMS-55 on 1 September 1947 and recommissioned on 10 May 1950, the former YMS returned to the Atlantic in September 1951 and took up training duties in the 5th Naval district. Initially based at Norfolk, Virginia, and then at the Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, Virginia. She continued to operate out of the Hampton Roads/Virginia Capes area through 1954. Then, in 1955, Seagull, redesignated MSC(O)-55 on 7 February, was transferred to Charleston, South Carolina, whence, for the remainder of her career, she conducted operations which took her along the southeastern Atlantic seaboard, along the ‚Äògulf coast, and into the Caribbean as a unit of MinRon 4. In mid-July 1957, the coastal minesweeper departed Charleston for Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on 11 October and placed in reserve. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1959.  Awards and honors  YMS-402 earned one battle star for her post-World War II minesweeping activities.

This book, like the other books that Michael Palin wrote following each of his seven trips for the BBC, consists both of his text and of many photographs to illustrate the trip. All of the pictures in this book were taken by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was part of the team who did the trip. The idea behind this trip was to visit all of the places where Ernest Hemingway had lived and traveled and visited. Michael Palin tried also to meet some people who had known Hemingway, and to do some of the things Hemingway had done. The book contains eight chapters: Chicago/Michigan, Italy, Paris, Spain, Key West, Africa, Cuba, and American West. The material follows Ernest Hemingway's life in chronological order, except that some chapters, for example Africa, cover several visits to the same place at different times in Hemingway's life. (This is somewhat different from the associated TV program, which makes almost no attempt to follow Hemingway's life chronologically.) The book also contains a three-page Introduction, a two-page world map showing the far-flung locations associated with Hemingway, and a two-page tabular summary of Hemingway's life. Michael Palin starts the book by telling of his own introduction to Hemingway's writing, reading A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and The Old Man and the Sea when he was only 13. But a fascination with Hemingway's authorship is not necessary to appreciate this trip, as it can be simply considered to be an exciting trip following in the footsteps of an exciting person. The trip was done in 1999, 100 years after Hemingway's birth in 1899. The text of this book is available free to read online on Michael Palin's official web site.  Audio edition  This book was made available as an audio book, read by Michael Palin himself, allowing the listener to hear his wit and charm, and his ability to do accents. The audio book does not include the photographs, of course. The audio book is unabridged, and lasts 6 hours 15 minutes.
