He is considered by law enforcement to be a close associate of Nicholas Corozzo and has served as his right-hand-man for almost 30 years. Brooklyn gangster  DiMaria was born to first-generation immigrants from Moliterno, province of Potenza, Italy. Before pursuing his life of crime, he worked as a railroad conductor for the Long Island Rail Road and employee of the New York and Atlantic Railway. These early jobs earned him the nickname \\"The Conductor\\". In the early 1980s, DiMaria became a soldier in the Gambino crime family, along with his driver Thomas \\"Spade\\" Muschio, age 24, who was incarcerated in 1983 to Raiford, Florida State Prison till his release in 1985, after the work release program he was then put on probation till 1988. Muschio now resides in North Carolina, and Toms River, New Jersey. Muschio was an upcoming member of the Gambino crime family at an early age. They both operated loansharking and extortion operations in both Queens and {Brooklyn} in the early days. They both soon became a close associate of Nicholas Corozzo. Muschio, was introduced into Organized Crime by Robert \\"Bobby Cabert\\" Bisaccia. In 1985, DiMaria, Corozzo, John Gotti, and other Gambino gangsters were indicted on racketeering charges in New York. During the trial, as each witness passed the defense table after testifying, DiMaria would stand, smile, extend his right hand, and say: \\"Gee, thanks for coming\\". In 1987, the defendants were acquitted. After Gotti was sent to prison in 1991, DiMaria was promoted to caporegime of a crew in Queens. In 1994, his fellow captain and associate Nick Corozzo became a member of the Gambino family Ruling Panel, which was meant to run the family with John Gotti in prison. DiMaria was then one of the main chiefs in the family, controlling everything from loansharking and illegal gambling, to racketeering and murder for hire. At age 53, DiMaria now had one of the best positions in the family, and soon began a lucrative partnership in Florida. South Florida and New York indictments In 1995, DiMaria, and Gambino capos Ralph Davino, Jr. and Anthony Ruggiano, Jr., together with Anthony \\"Tony Pep\\" Trentacosta, started operating in Florida on behalf of Corozzo. These three capos would be called the \\"South Florida Crew\\", operating from both New York and Florida. On December 18, 1996, DiMaria was arrested at his home in Flatlands, Brooklyn on loansharking and racketeering charges in Florida.\\"Reputed new Gambino boss is arrested\\" New York Times December 19, 1996 While out on bail, DiMaria was indicted a month later on separate loansharking and racketeering charges in New York after a three-year investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The New York indictments were based partly on evidence gathered at the Portobello Soccer Club in Canarsie, Brooklyn. The club was a sting operation that purchased stolen designer clothing, computers, and other goods from Gambino mobsters.\\"F.B.I.

The hopje is named after Baron Hendrik Hop who was recalled as an envoy in Brussels when the French invaded Belgium in 1792. He moved into rooms above the confectioners Van Haaren & Nieuwerkerk. He was addicted to coffee and the story goes that one night he left his coffee with sugar and cream on the heater, where it evaporated. On tasting the resulting substance, he loved it. His doctor advised him not to drink coffee so he asked the confectioner Theodorus van Haaren to make him some \\"lumps of coffee\\". After some experimenting, Van Haaren created a sweet made of coffee, caramel, cream and butter. The enthusiastic Baron Hop was keen to let his guests try his 'Hopjes', which quickly gained popularity. Van Haaren's successor eventually even got orders from abroad. A typical characteristic of the hopje is that it does not stick and that it does not go soft over time. The Hague had a museum called Museum voor het Haagsche Hopje, which was dedicated to the hopje and its history. The museum has now closed down. J.P. Rademaker copied the hopjes and marketed them as \\"the only real Haagsche Hopjes\\". He was the first to wrap the individual sweets in printed paper, which was not usual at the time. Rademaker and Nieuwerkerk litigated for many years. When the Rotterdam company Rademaker took Nieuwerkerk over in 1949 the dispute continued between the two Rademaker companies for 40 years, until a 1989 ruling from the Dutch Advertising Code Committee ordered Rademaker to desist from using the term \\"the only real Haagsche Hopjes\\". Currently Rademaker Hopjes wrappers display the phrase \\"Alleen Echt Met Dit Merk\\" (Dutch: \\"Only Real With This Brand\\") instead. Rademaker has been owned by RBV Leaf, part of the CSM group, since 1999.

The group consists of Greg Sherman (born 1954) on keyboards, vibes & Mellotron, his brother Jeff Sherman (b. 1952) on bass guitar, guitar, bass pedals and keyboards, and their childhood friend Jerry Cook (b. 1953) on drums and percussion. History Glass at the Court C Coffeehouse, 1972 Glass began in the 1960s as a Port Townsend-based rock band called The Vaguest Notion, playing covers and the occasional original piece. On September 6, 1968 they attended a Jimi Hendrix concert at the Seattle Center Coliseum where the opening act was the British band The Soft Machine. They were transfixed by The Soft Machine, a guitar-less power trio. Shortly thereafter The Vaguest Notion changed their name to Glass and began playing originals exclusively. In 1970 Jeff and Greg attended the Famous Arrangers Clinic in Las Vegas, further refining their song-writing skills. Moving to Olympia, Washington in 1971 to attend The Evergreen State College, they quickly became favorites on-campus for their spirited performances. Numerous live performances in and around Olympia, Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, Port Townsend and other Pacific Northwest venues (including the first-ever live broadcast concert on KAOS-FM) gave them considerable local attention and accolades. They received their best reception at the first Jimi Hendrix Memorial Concert in Seattle (January 22, 1971 at the Eagles Auditorium BuildingDescription of the Hendrix Memorial fundraiser from HistoryLink) where they were the only band to play totally original material. Professional studio recordings were made in 1975, which they then shopped around to various record labels in an attempt to land a record contract. =Dissolution= Unfortunately the mid-1970s was not a good time for rehearsal-intensive progressive rock. The music industry was being taken over by punk rock and disco to the point where even well-established rock acts were being dropped from their labels. Despite their well-honed local reputation, Glass was not offered a contract by any of the dozens of labels they approached on the West Coast and in New York City. Two members even undertook a trip to London in the summer of 1975 to speak with industry representatives in the birthplace of progressive rock, but if anything the economic and musical depression was even worse in England. In 1977 additional recordings were made at Seattle's premiere Kaye-Smith Studios, but despite very positive comments from everyone who heard them, no recording contract was forthcoming. Not for lack of trying. Disappointed and disillusioned, the band officially went into remission rather than compromise. The band members went their separate ways, to pursue solo careers (see Jeff Sherman (musician)), start families and generally pretend to be normal people. =Re-emergence= Twenty years passed. By the mid-1990s a full-scale progressive rock revival was brewing, thanks to the internet and the new economics of CD releases. Glass began contemplating a comeback and started testing the waters, contacting old fans, making new business connections. In 1999 rehearsals began, and the old spark was still there. Their old tapes were dusted off and digitized. Glass started their own small- run record label, the appropriately-named Relentless Pursuit Records, to release Glass music and solo recordings by the band members. After considerable digital cleanup and editing, a 2-CD boxed set of all of their professional (and some amateur) recordings from 1973–1977 was released, entitled No Stranger To The Skies.NSTTS review at Progressor Following the resounding success of that release a third volume was released the following year. NSTTS-III review at Geocities Several concerts were arranged and performed, not only in the Pacific Northwest but also in Mexico (BajaProg Festival in 2002 and 2004), ProgWest Festival (Claremont CA, 2001), and Progman Cometh Festival (Seattle 2002 and 2003). =Contract At Last= The acclaim garnered by their live performances attracted the attention of French independent progressive rock label Musea Records, who in 2004 offered to re- release No Stranger To The Skies and give it worldwide distribution. This release finally brought Glass global recognition. Simultaneously the Sherman brothers were brimming with ideas for new music, and began writing and rehearsing new material for their \\"first all-original album in 27 years.\\" That album, Illuminations, was produced by keyboardist Greg Sherman and featured a cover photo by Glass's long-time engineer and sound man Erik Poulsen. It was released by Musea in 2005 to uniformly great reviews.Illuminations review at Aural Innovations Illuminations review at GeocitiesIlluminations review at ProgArchives Bringing the music full circle, Illuminations features guest appearances by some of the Canterbury scene's best musicians—the same movement that had originally sparked the formation of Glass some 37 years earlier—including Hugh Hopper (ex-Soft Machine), Richard Sinclair and Phil Miller. Glass live at Progman Cometh In October 2007 Glass embarked on their first-ever European tour to support their newly released live recording on Musea, Glass Live at Progman Cometh. Glass returned to the recording studio in 2008 and 2009 to record their 4th album for Musea, entitled Spectrum Principle. It was released worldwide on October 15, 2010. Produced by drummer Jerry Cook, it is a departure from their previous studio album Illuminations, featuring a wilder, more experimental sound.Spectrum Principle review at ProgNautSpectrum Principle review at Aural InnovationsSpectrum Principle review at ProgressoR In April 2011 Glass came back to their hometown of Port Townsend, Washington to record a \\"live in-the-studio\\" album. They booked the old Arcadia Barn, where they had recorded thirty-eight years earlier, now renovated and called \\"The Palindrome.\\" Produced by bassist Jeff Sherman, the album was recorded in Zen style; the band did not undergo the usual months of pre-recording preparations but instead came together in the studio and played whatever ideas came to mind. These recordings were made largely on period instruments, in the old-fashioned way, directly to a two-track analog tape recorder, just as they had in 1973. They were also given permission to record inside The First Presbyterian Church of Port Townsend on their magnificent 1849 Whalley-Genung pipe organ. The album, titled Palindrome, was mastered by Michael King (engineer and author of \\"Wrong Movements: A Robert Wyatt Biography\\") and released in 2014 on Musea Records.Palindrome review at ProgArchivesYouTube video off Palindrome During March and April 2015 Glass laid down basic tracks for a new album, entitled Emergence. Produced by Greg Sherman, the album went through a long two-year gestation of being honed and edited, eventually adding some sax and vocals by three guest musicians. The album was released January 5, 2018. Glass has a short cameo in the 2015 film about the Canterbury scene, Romantic Warriors III: Canterbury Tales, and appears more extensively (over 26 minutes of performance footage, plus two interviews) in the companion disc Romantic Warriors III: Special Features DVD, both from Zeitgeist Media.

Merrill Root (January 4, 1895 – October 26, 1973), was an American educator and poet devoted to anti-communist causes. Biography Root was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of a Congregationalist Church minister. In 1917, he graduated from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he studied under Robert Frost. Root was a conscientious objector during World War I. He went to France with the American Friends Service Committee, saw action as an ambulance driver and returned to the United States to study at Andover, the University of Missouri, and Harvard. In 1920, he began working at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, as a professor of English literature, where his tenure lasted until his retirement in 1960. While working at Earlham, Root began to change from a devout Quaker and pacifist into an active advocate of political conservatism.Guide to the E. Merrill Root Papers 1917-1967 Root first exploded into political print with \\"Darkness at Noon in American Colleges\\",Human Events, July 30, 1952 an article in which he warned parents that their sons and daughters were catching the \\"polio of collectivism\\" at colleges and universities. Feeling that this article was not enough to convince people to listen, Root wrote Collectivism on the Campus, in which he claimed communism was widespread at American universities and colleges. A few years later, he wrote Brainwashing in the High Schools: An Examination of Eleven American History Textbooks. Both of these volumes investigate the alleged undermining of American scholarship by the left. Both consider at length and in detail, subversive attacks against the integrity of American educational institutions and the blatant perversion of such disciplines as history, literature, and philosophy. These books brought Root fame in conservative circles. He also became a member of the Textbook Evaluation Committee of Operation Textbook, sponsored by America's Future under the direction of Lucille Cardin Crain. Root was one of the founders and original contributors to National Review, famously squaring off against Wittaker Chambers in reviews of novels by Ayn Rand in which Root defended her as a brilliantly gifted artist against Chambers' complaint that as a militant atheist she should be driven from the nascent conservative movement. In retirement, Root withdrew from the masthead of National Review and became an editor of the monthly American Opinion magazine, as well as continuing his editorial relationship with The American Friend, The Measure, and Quaker Life. His book America's Steadfast Dream, published in 1971, is an anthology of twenty-five essays that appeared in American Opinion over a period of a decade. As well as his writings on subversion in education, Merrill Root published several books of poetry that met with a measure of critical acclaim; amongst his admirers was his former teacher, Robert Frost. Root also wrote a non-critical biography of Frank Harris. Root's central philosophy was what he called \\"Essentialism\\". His intention was \\"... to make coherent and affirmative a certain philosophy, and American philosophy, and to do so in terms of art.\\" He stated his philosophy thus: > \\"More and more as my life has matured, I have realized that by fundamental > nature I am a conservative. I have realized that I wish to preserve the > roots of life whence grow the blossoms and the fruits of life, and that I > have become a genuine radical - i.e., one who works with the roots of life, > laboring to set them more firmly and to nourish them more richly. I applaud > fruitful change that comes from an enhancement and intensification of the > last things that maintain their continuity with first things. But, as I see > it, such change must be growth from within, so that you and I and our nation > become ever more clearly, more richly, more truly, what we always are, > potentially in principle. Man is ever seeking novelty; God is forever and > ever making things new. He does not make the seasons, nor the rose, nor the > Labrador retriever, nor the lover nor the poet, novel - He makes them new. > And because they are new in their fundamental being, they are vitally old; > as tomorrow's sunrise will be the newest of dawns and the oldest of dawns, > since it shone upon the Birthday of Creation.\\" For the individual, Root stated his philosophy as a person's \\"outermost expression of his innermost essence ... Man, being finite in existence, but infinite in essence, succeeds by reaching his highest point of failure.\\" E. Merrill Root died in 1973 in Kennebunkport on the Atlantic coast of Maine.

Bockting, 549 U.S. 406 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case about the application of the Confrontation Clause and whether Crawford v. Washington (2006) applied retroactively. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that Crawford did not apply retroactively.  Background  The respondent, Marvin Howard Bockting, of Las Vegas, Nevada, was accused of sexual assault of his wife Laura's six-year-old daughter. A police detective interviewed the victim in the presence of her mother, and physical evidence was gathered at a hospital. The grand jury indicted Bockting on four counts of sexual assault on a minor under 14 years of age. The victim testified at the preliminary hearing, and Bockting was held over for trial. At trial, the court held a hearing to determine whether the victim could testify. Finding that Autumn was too distressed to be sworn in, the State moved to allow Laura Bockting and the detective to recount the victim's statements to the jury. Under Nevada law, out-of-court statements made by a child under 10 years of age describing acts of sexual assault or physical abuse of the child may be admitted if the court finds that the child is unavailable or unable to testify and that \\"the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\\"Nev. Rev. Stat. §51.385 (2003) The court found sufficient evidence of reliability to admit the testimony. After hearing the evidence, the jury found Bockting guilty of three counts of sexual assault on a minor under the age of 14, and the court imposed two consecutive life sentences and another concurrent life sentence. = Procedural history = Bockting appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court, alleging that by allowing the out-of-court statements to be read to the jury, the state had violated Bockting's confrontation clause rights under the Sixth Amendment. That Court held that the admission of the testimony was constitutional.Bockting v. State, 109 Nev. 103, 847 P. 2d 1364 (1993) Bockting then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, making the same argument. The Court denied the petition, stating that Bockting was not entitled to relief under the habeas statute. Bockting appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While the appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Crawford v. Washington, in which the Court held that testimony of witnesses absent from trial are admissible only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The Ninth Circuit held that Crawford applied retroactively, and reversed the lower court decision.Bockting v. Bayer, 399 F. 3d 1010, as amended, 408 F. 3d 1127 (2005). The State appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Decision  = Issue = Did the holding in Crawford apply retroactively to judgments in criminal cases that are already final on direct review? = Opinion of the Court = Justice Samuel Alito gave the unanimous opinion of the Court. \\"Because Crawford announced a new rule and because it is clear and undisputed that the rule is procedural and not substantive, that rule cannot be applied in this collateral attack on respondent’s conviction unless it is a watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\\"Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. ___ (2006)(internal quotes omitted) There are two requirements for a holding to be a \\"watershed rule\\" First, the new rule must be \\"necessary to prevent an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction.\\" Second, it must \\"alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\\" The Court found that the holding in Crawford did not meet the first requirement, as it was too limited in scope. It also did not meet the second requirement, in that it only slightly changed the cross-examination jurisprudence, but did not fundamentally alter it. Therefore, the Court held, it was not a \\"watershed rule\\" and did not apply retroactively to Bockting's case.

Details are scarce, but the reader is told that the enemy is an Asian superpower known as \\"the Yellow Empire\\", ruled by the Emperor Basam Damdu; the free world and the Yellow Empire have been locked in a cold war for the past three years. Within the first few pages of the book, the Yellow launch a worldwide aggression with modern rockets, bombers and paratroopers that quickly destroy and conquer the world's other major powers. However, the British military has been secretly working on a new type of superweapon known as the Swordfish, in anticipation of the war. Forewarned of the attack by a traitor in the Yellow army, Captain Francis Blake, a British officer, and Professor Phillip Mortimer, the scientist developing the Swordfish, escape with the superweapon's plans, their destination being a secret base in the Middle East where they will be able to finish their work. The rest of the episode follows their attempts to escape the pursuing Yellow forces, led by the cunning and conniving Colonel Olrik, Basam Damdu's chief of security. They initially escape from Britain in a jet- powered airplane called the \\"Golden Rocket\\", but are shot down somewhere over Iran by Yellow interceptors, and must continue the trek to the secret base on foot. Along the way, they encounter resistance fighter Ahmed Nasir, who becomes an invaluable help to them, and finally seek refuge in a small town in the Herat province. There, they are quickly betrayed by a Yellow spy. The episode ends with a cliffhanger: the soldiers of the Yellow army are directed to the room where Blake and Mortimer are staying and as they enter they find an astonishing surprise (naturally the reader can only see their reaction, not the cause of it). =Part 2= \\"Mortimer's Escape\\" takes place in two distinct halves. The first one picks up right where \\"Ruthless Pursuit\\" left off. After finding the room empty, the enraged Yellow commander orders his troops to search the city until they find Blake and Mortimer; however, he executes one of the community's elders in the process when the latter refuses to cooperate. This sparks an immediate insurrection in which the outraged townsmen quickly massacre the Yellow troops; in the ensuing chaos, Blake and Mortimer emerge from hiding and take off again, still with Nasir helping them. Eventually, the three of them make it to the Strait of Hormuz, but Blake is injured and loses the wallet containing the Swordfish plans while trying to escape a Yellow patrol. Mortimer then tells Nasir to take Blake to safety, while he returns to search for the plans. He is himself then captured by Yellow troops, but not before he is able to find and conceal the plans. The second half of the episode begins three months later in Lhassa (the Yellow capital), with Colonel Olrik making a report to the high council of the Yellow Empire. The Yellow are having more and more difficulty controlling their new empire; rebellions and acts of terrorism have continued worldwide, and despite their best efforts, they have still not been able to sweat the Swordfish plans out of Mortimer. As chief of the Empire's security service, Olrik is the natural scapegoat for this state of affairs; he therefore decides to take the gloves completely off and torture Mortimer as harshly as necessary, hoping to finally elicit a confession. Under instructions from Nasir, who has managed to infiltrate his prison, Mortimer pretends to relent, and agrees to reconstitute the Swordfish plans for the Yellow. After this, we are finally shown the secret base, where Blake and the admiral in command, Sir William Grey, have been conducting resistance against the Yellow (including many of the incidents that Olrik is being blamed for). They now have two urgent priorities; first, to find the lost plans and second, to break Mortimer out of prison. The first problem is resolved when Mortimer is able to pass a message to Nasir telling him where the plans are hidden. Soon after this, Mortimer almost manages a prison break on his own; before the Yellow are able to capture him, he is rescued by Blake and Nasir, who then take him to a submarine and manage to escape under the nose of the Yellow navy and air force. =Part 3= \\"SX1 counterattacks\\", the third part of the saga, begins soon after Mortimer's escape. In the first pages, British commandos attack and capture a Yellow train taking imprisoned scientists to a forced labor camp. The scientists are freed and taken back to the Hormuz base, where they also begin to work on the Swordfish project. Soon after this, acts of sabotage begin to disrupt the base, and Blake suspects that one of the captured scientists was actually a Yellow mole. This is eventually revealed to be none other than Olrik himself, who personally undertook the operation in an attempt to reestablish his reputation before the Emperor. Olrik manages to escape from the base, and the British are faced with an imminent Yellow invasion. Mortimer suggests a drastic solution; concentrate all the base's efforts on the assembly of only two working Swordfish, which should be enough to destroy a Yellow invasion force. He estimates thirty hours are all the time needed to accomplish this, and Admiral Grey gives him his word that the base will hold. The next morning, a vast Yellow task force, composed of an aircraft carrier battle group and a number of land and air forces, appears and surrounds the base. The initial attacks are defeated and turned back by the heroic efforts of the British. However, Olrik then deploys new chemical weapons against the base, which allow the Yellow to gain a foothold and slowly begin to work their way inwards. However, both Mortimer and Grey keep their word, and the two Swordfish (designated SX1 and SX2, hence the title) are finished in time. The weapons, piloted by Blake and Mortimer, are unleashed and destroy the Yellow task force in minutes, though one of them is lost in combat. The base is saved, and Sir William Grey launches a radio call to the resistance movements of the world telling them the news and urging them to revolt. In the following week, open rebellions erupt worldwide, taxing the overextended resources of the Yellow to the limit until the Emperor decides to end the war by launching ICBMs against all the rebel targets (with Olrik strapped to one of the rockets as punishment for his failures). Before he can do this, however, an entire squadron of Swordfish arrives over Lhassa and nukes the city, killing Basam Damdu and decapitating the Yellow Empire under Olrik's mocking eyes. The last scene shows Blake and Mortimer back in a ruined and destroyed London, with Blake commenting that they will rebuild and that civilization, once again, has had the last word—\\"hopefully, this time, for good.\\" Characters * Francis Blake: a former British Royal Air Force pilot and member of the Intelligence Service, who tries unsuccessfully to warn the British government of the impending invasion. He is a key member of the resistance movement. * Phillip Mortimer: a Scottish-born scientist, and inventor of the Swordfish super weapon. Though a man of science at heart, he can also hold his own in the field and is quite at home in the action of the world war. * Colonel Olrik: the head of the 13th Bureau, the Yellow state security organ. A European of unknown nationality (possibly German, Russian or Baltic) who betrayed his country to go work for the Yellow. * Ahmed Nasir: a sergeant in the Makran Levy Corps, a British-raised colonial army. He saves Blake and Mortimer from a Yellow trap on the Iranian-Indian border, and is invaluable to them for the rest of the novels. * Sir William Grey: a Royal Navy admiral, commanding the secret base in Hormuz and by extension the entire worldwide resistance effort. Loosely based on Winston Churchill, a character similar to Grey is shown serving as the Prime Minister in The Yellow \\"M\\". * Emperor Basam Damdu: the absolute dictator of the Yellow Empire. A megalomaniac based on Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, obsessed with ruling the world and willing to destroy it rather than lose control of it. * Colonel Li: Olrik's aide de camp, a loyal soldier and accomplished martial artist. * Rasul: better known as \\"the Bezendjas\\" (name of his tribe), he is a native spy recruited by Olrik in his search for Blake and Mortimer. * Sun Fo: a scientist, member of the Yellow high council and special adviser to Basam Damdu with whom Olrik has a mutually antagonistic relationship.

The site is on private land within the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Glacier County, Montana. It is located along the south bank of Cut Bank Creek and northeast of Browning, Montana. Glacier National Park can be seen in the distance. The campsite was used by a detachment of the expedition from July 22–26, 1806. Captain Meriwether Lewis, George Drouillard, the two Fields brothersJoseph and Reubin, possibly five more men, along with six horses. The party was exploring the Marias River in an attempt to show that the Missouri River watershed extended to the 50th parallel north in order to claim more land for the United States under the Louisiana Purchase. However, they discovered that the watershed does not extend to the 50th parallel and consequently named their campsite Camp Disappointment. Lewis called the site which is shaded by cottonwood trees a \\"beautiful and extensive bottom\\". Since it was overcast and damp throughout their stay the expedition could not make any astronomical observations. This part of the expedition split off from William Clark's group at the Great Falls of the Missouri on July 16. On the morning of July 26, 1806 they left the camp to head back and later that day met a party of eight Blackfeet Indians, the first members of that tribe that the expedition had encountered. The Blackfeet seemed friendly towards them, and the two parties agreed to set up and share a camp for the night. Over the course of the evening, the Blackfeet became aware that the expedition party had been trading with as well as brokering peace with any and all tribes that they'd encountered, including many of the Blackfeet's enemies and rivals. Among those goods traded were firearms, which especially aggravated the Blackfeet, as guns were then considered a relatively scarce and extremely valuable military commodity for the tribes of the area, and one which the Blackfeet had been trying to monopolize for themselves up until that point. As a result, after both parties had apparently retired for the night, the Blackfeet men attempted to steal the expedition members' various guns while they slept. One of the party members awoke during the attempted burglary, thereby alerting the others, and the situation rapidly escalated into a violent conflict between the two groups. During the fight, two of the Blackfeet were shot and killed by two of the Lewis party members, in what the latter considered acts of deeply regrettable, yet necessary self-defense. Because the conflict occurred near the Two Medicine River, it subsequently became known as the Two Medicine Fight, and would be the only time throughout the entire Lewis and Clark expedition that an encounter with Native Americans resulted in violence on either side. In 1925 the Great Northern Railway erected a monument similar to the Washington Monument and a sign south of the campsite reached on July 23, 1806. This is near mile marker 233 and several hundred yards north of U.S. Route 2. Access to the campsite is only via a primitive road just west of this marker. It was declared both a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The site is relatively unchanged since the expedition camped here. Though on private property, one can visit with an admission fee and a 4-wheel drive vehicle. The site includes an ancient Indian buffalo jump. From the National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form: > \\"At the campsite today wide lowland meadows are watered by the Cut Bank > Creek and cottonwood trees line its banks.

George Anton Basserman (4 October 1832 – 27 September 1887)George Anton Basserman, I at findagrave.com was a noted brewery owner in the Cedar Hill neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut during the late 19th century. Born in Germany in 1832, and came to New Haven in 1851. Basserman was owner of the Rock Brewery on State and Rock St. He blasted a cellar in at the foot of East Rock to start his brewery under which he excavated a cellar, 200 feet deep, 24 feet wide, and 16 feet high, for storing his brewings. The average production of this brewery was from 15,000 to 20,000 barrels a year. Once in business, he made a large bottling plant. The brewery proper comprised a three-story building, partly of stone, 185 by 50 feet in dimensions, while the attached sheds and barns covered an area 688 by 50 feet. It was also remembered for its authentic German beer gardens, built next to the brewery. Although the building was destroyed in a fire, part of the wall remains. Across the street he built a residence for his employees, which was later known as the \\"George Basserman Building\\". 1886 The State of Connecticut vs Basserman: A complaint was filed against Basserman for selling \\"intoxicating\\" liquors.

He is currently signed to Ring of Honor (ROH) as a member of Villain Enterprises and to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). In Ring of Honor he is a one-time ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship and a one-time ROH World Television Champion. He also works for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he is a former IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champion. From May 2017 to late October 2018, he was a member of the Bullet Club stable, which splintered into the new faction The Elite. The latter left ROH at the end of 2018 which led Scurll to form a new stable with ROH's new signees King and PCO called Villain Enterprises, which debuted during December's post-Final Battle television tapings. He has wrestled for numerous promotions around the world - such as the U.S. based Impact Wrestling and ROH partner Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), the UK's Progress Wrestling and Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW), Germany's Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), and the Australia based World Series Wrestling (WSW) where he is currently World Champion. Professional wrestling career =Independent circuit (2005–2019)= Marty started training at Frank Rimer's Dropkixx training school which would also produce wrestlers like Martin Stone, The Kartel and Paul Robinson. Marty made his debut for Dropkixx at the Fondu Club in Purfleet, defeating Jimmy Starr by two falls to one. Once under the tutorship of Jon Ritchie, who by this time was in charge at Dropkixx, Marty took part in Dropkixx's Shoot Fighting Tournament. Scurll would go on to win the middleweight tournament, in the process becoming Dropkixx's first middleweight champion. Scurll also competed regularly for Summit Promotions, and at the end of the year formed a tag team with Paul Robinson as 'The Party Boys' (or 'The Midnight Ravers', as they were sometimes billed). Scurll would go on to appear for Premier Promotions and this would be the place where he would meet Phil Powers, who he ended up wrestling many times in the summer season on the holiday camps circuit. During the rest of the year, Scurll debuted for the likes of IPW:UK and RQW, wrestling Jonny Storm, Taiji Ishimori, Bubblegum and many others. On 5 June 2007, Marty made his debut for All Star Wrestling by defeating Jimmy Starr at Gravesend. Marty competed regularly for All Star, including main eventing Fairfield Halls, Croydon against Pro Wrestling NOAH's Shuhei Taniguchi and Tsutomu Hirayanagi. In IPW:UK, Marty would reform his tag team with Zack Sabre Jr., but under the name The Leaders of the New School. They then feuded with BritRage (Mark Sloan and Wade Flitzgerald) and The Kartel. Scurll wrestled and lost to Doug Williams in IPW:UK's British National Championship Tournament.IPW:UK :: International Pro Wrestling :: British National Championship Scurll as the British Cruiserweight Champion in April 2012 In 2009, Scurll and Sabre focused their attention on the IPW:UK tag team division, and picked up a memorable win against tag team champions The Thrillers (Mark Haskins and Joel Redman) during the company's February tour. A highly anticipated rematch finally took place between the teams at the 2009 \\"Sittingbourne Spectacular\\" after the Leaders' scheduled opponents had to pull out through injury. This time the championships were on the line, and the Leaders won again to claim their first championship gold in IPW:UK. The feud between the Leaders and the Thrillers became the dominant storyline in IPW:UK through the summer, culminating in the Leaders winning a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match against their rivals in September. The Leaders have enjoyed an unbroken reign as champions since that time. Scurll and Sabre competed in the first match of the newly re-launched Frontier Wrestling Alliance in August 2009, beating Northern Xposure (NX) at \\"New Frontiers\\". On 28 April 2012, Scurll defeated Sami Callihan in the final of an eight-man tournament to determine the new IPW:UK British Cruiserweight Champion. On 15 March 2014, Scurll defeated Colt Cabana in a 30 Minute Iron Fist match to become Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro) Undisputed British Heavyweight Champion. Scurll would go on to successfully defend the championship against the likes of Ricochet, Kevin Steen, Martin Stone, Davey Richards, Doug Williams, Shelton Benjamin, Rocky Romero and others, before losing the title to New Japan Pro- Wrestling (NJPW) wrestler A. J. Styles at the 2015 Summer Sizzler event on 14 June 2015. Scurll debuted for Scotland's Insane Championship Wrestling promotion in late 2014, unsuccessfully challenging Kenny Williams for the ICW Zero-G Championship before continuing to appear for the promotion in 2015, culminating in a main-event non-title loss to reigning ICW World Heavyweight Champion Drew Galloway. Scurll scored his first win in ICW in a four-way match against Noam Dar, Jack Gallagher and Dan Moloney. On 4 April 2015, at a sold- out British Championship Wrestling event in Scotland, Scurll challenged Galloway in a Double Title match for both the Evolve World Championship and the Dragon Gate USA Open the Freedom Gate Championship, but was defeated. In October 2015, Scurll debuted for Global Force Wrestling (GFW) on their \\"UK Invasion\\", losing to GFW Global Champion Nick Aldis in a singles match and teaming with Rampage Brown in a losing effort against Doug Williams and Aldis. Scurll returned to the company in March 2016, unsuccessfully challenging Sonjay Dutt for the GFW NEX*GEN Championship. In early October 2017 at What Culture Pro Wrestling's (WCPW) event Refuse to Lose, Scurll won a triple threat match between Joe Hendry and Will Ospreay and himself to become the sixth and final WCPW champion, before the company rebranded as Defiant Wrestling. On 4 December at Defiant Wrestling's iPPV, titled WeAreDefiant, Scurll was given the new championship belt by General Manager Stu Bennett, and had a confrontation with the debuting Austin Aries at the beginning of the show. In the main event of the evening, Scurll successfully defended the championship in a triple threat match between himself, Joe Hendry and Martin Kirby. However, on 5 December at Defiant's first episode of their new weekly show (uploaded 15 December on YouTube), Scurll lost the championship to Aries, ending his reign at 34 days. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2012–2013)= Scurll in January 2013 In late 2012, Scurll began competing in TNA's newest program TNA Wrestling: British Boot Camp that began airing on 1 January 2013 on Challenge. On 14 February edition of Impact Wrestling, he teamed up with The Blossom Twins (Hannah and Holly) to face the team of Jessie Godderz, Tara and Gail Kim. They were defeated after Gail Kim pinned Hannah. During the match, Scurll was injured after performing a suicide dive into the metal railing. =Progress Wrestling (2012–2017)= Scurll was part of the very first Progress Wrestling show, Chapter One, in a tournament to determine the first ever Progress Champion. He beat Zack Sabre Jr in an acclaimed semi-final match before competing in a four-way match for the title against Mike Mason, El Ligero and winner Nathan Cruz. Scurll went on to challenge Cruz for the title in a Two Out of Three Falls match at Chapter Two, failing to capture the title. Competing regularly for Progress, he was notably part of a four-way match for the Progress Championship at Chapter Twelve, facing Rampage Brown, El Ligero and then-champion Jimmy Havoc, and fighting again for the title at Chapter Eighteen against Will Ospreay, Noam Dar, Dave Mastiff, Paul Robinson and champion Jimmy Havoc. Scurll reached the quarter-finals of the first Super Strong Style 16 tournament in 2015, beating Eddie Dennis on Day One and Dave Mastiff in the quarter-finals before losing to Zack Sabre Jr on Day Two, and was runner-up to Mark Haskins in the 2015 Thunderbastard match at Chapter Twenty. He lost to Kris Travis at Chapter Twenty-One, Travis’ final match before his retirement from wrestling and death from stomach cancer. Scurll turned firmly villainous following this match; gaining a demented mean streak that saw him win the Progress Championship for the first time in a No Disqualification match against Will Ospreay at Chapter Twenty-Five. Scurll went on to successfully defend the title against Mark Haskins, Chris Hero, and Tommy End in singles competition and against seven opponents in the 2016 Thunderbastard match which he won. He was the first Progress Champion to defend the title overseas – successfully defending the belt against Will Ospreay at WrestleCon SuperShow 2016 in Dallas, Texas and against Zack Gibson in Italy for Power Wrestling Entertainment. Scurll lost the title to Pastor William Eaver at Chapter Thirty-Two and regained it a month later at Chapter Thirty-Three, making him the first person to ever win the Progress Championship more than once. After successfully defending the belt against Mark Andrews at Chapter Thirty-Five, Scurll lost the Progress Championship to Mark Haskins in a triple-threat main event match also involving Tommy End at Chapter Thirty-Six, PROGRESS' biggest show to date, held at the Brixton Academy in London. During the match, Scurll attacked three referees as he became frustrated at not being able to win; before attacking a fourth official Jimmy Havoc returned to attack Scurll, leading to his loss. At Chapter 38, Scurll failed to regain the Progress Championship in a match that also included Jimmy Havoc. After being disqualified against Havoc at Chapter 39, the two had a No Disqualification at Chapter 40 where Scurll lost. In 2017 Scurll returned to Progress on Chapter 55 being defeated by Zack Sabre Jr.. =Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2015–2018)= Scurll made his PWG debut at the 2015 Battle of Los Angeles, where he beat Rich Swann in round one, Trevor Lee in the quarter-finals and lost to Zack Sabre Jr. in the semi-finals. Scurll then suffered a string of singles losses; losing to Ricochet at All Star Weekend 11 Night One and to Timothy Thatcher on Night Two, to Kyle O'Reilly on All Star Weekend 12 Night One and to Chuck Taylor on Night Two. At Prince, he won a match against Mark Andrews and at Thirteen, gained victory over Sami Callihan. In September, Scurll participated the 2016 Battle of Los Angeles, defeating Pentagón Jr. in the first round, Cody Rhodes in the quarterfinals, Mark Haskins in the semifinals, and both Will Ospreay and Trevor Lee in a three-way elimination final to win the tournament. On 18 February 2017, Scurll reunited with Sabre, as they attacked Chuck Taylor, only to see Trent? come to Taylor's defence. At PWG Mystery Vortex V on 12 January 2018 Marty was defeated by Trent?. =Ring of Honor (2016–present)= Scurll (left) with fellow Bullet Club members Cody and Hangman Page in 2018 On 22 August 2016, the American Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion announced Scurll's upcoming debut for the promotion. Pro Wrestling Torch reported that Scurll had signed with the company after giving his notice to Evolve the previous month. Scurll made his ROH debut during the promotion's three-day tour of the United Kingdom in November. On 20 November, during the final day of the tour, Scurll defeated Will Ospreay to win the ROH World Television Championship. Scurll successfully defended his newly won title against previous champion Ospreay and Dragon Lee in a triple threat match at ROH's biggest pay-per-view, Final Battle 2016. The beginning of 2017 saw Scurll make many successful defences of his title against Juice Robinson, Donovan Dijak, Sonjay Dutt, Lio Rush and Adam Cole. During a successful defence against Frankie Kazarian, both Hangman Page and the returning Matt Sydal returned. On 29 April 2017 at ROH Masters Of The Craft Scurll successful retained the ROH World Television Championship against Ken Anderson. On 12 May 2017, during the third night of the NJPW and ROH co- produced War of the Worlds tour, Scurll was revealed as the newest member of Bullet Club, replacing Adam Cole. Two days later, on the final night of the tour, Scurll lost the ROH World Television Championship to Kushida, following a distraction from Cole. The Elite, minus Scurll, left ROH after 14 December 2018's Final Battle pay-per-view.

Katchatheevu (, ) is a 285-acre uninhabited volcanic island administered by Sri Lanka and was a disputed territory claimed by India until 1976. The island is located between Neduntheevu, Sri Lanka and Rameswaram, India and has been traditionally used by both Sri Lankan Tamil and Indian fishermen. In 1974, then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi ceded Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka under the \\"Indo-Sri Lankan Maritime agreement\\" aimed at resolving the maritime boundaries in the Palk Strait. Another agreement signed in 1976 restricted both the countries’ fishermen from fishing in the other’s exlusive economic zones. Earlier, it was owned by the Ramnad Kingdom of Ramanathapuram Rameshwaram which later came under the Madras Presidency during British rule of India. It was recognised by Ceylon as part of British India after the delimitation of Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait between the then governments of Madras and Ceylon. However in 1921, both Sri Lanka and India laid claims to Katchatheevu.Katchatheevu: The big issue over a small island, Livemint, 15 Jun 2016.  Geography  island is situated on the Sri Lankan side of the maritime boundary.  History  The island was earlier part of the Ramnad Kingdom which existed in Madurai district of India. Later on with the British rule on the Indian subcontinent was the island part of the Madras Presidency. Ownership of the island was controversial up until 1974 as during British rule the island was administered by both countries. India recognized Sri Lankan equal ownership. The legality of the transfer was challenged in the Indian Supreme Court since the recognizing was not ratified by the Indian parliament.This recognition of an island that is culturally important to fishermen of Tamil Nadu state in India has led to some agitations by Tamil Nadu politicians that it should be claimed to Indian sovereignty. The island is also important for fishing grounds used by fishers from both countries. The Indo-Sri Lankan agreement allows Indian fishermen to fish around Katchatheevu and to dry their nets on the island. As part of the Sri Lankan Civil War, the arrangement led to many difficulties with the Sri Lankan Navy, which was deployed to prevent smuggling of weapons by the rebel group LTTE. The island has a Catholic shrine that attracted devotees from both countries. The main problem continues to grow as more fisherman move into the Sri Lankan sea area for illegal poaching. In 2010 the Sri Lankan government issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu government saying the Indian court cannot nullify the 1974 agreement. In June 2011 the new Tamil Nadu government led by the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, J. Jayalalithaa, filed a petition in the Supreme Court that the declaration of the 1974 and 1976 agreements between India and Sri Lanka on ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka were unconstitutional. The court ruled in the Berubari case that the cession of Indian territory to another country had to be ratified by parliament through amendment of the Constitution. However, the Indian government has stated, \\"No territory belonging to India was ceded nor sovereignty relinquished since the area was in dispute and had never been demarcated\\" and that the dispute on the status of the island was settled in 1974 by an agreement, and both countries took into account historical evidence and legal aspects.  St. Anthony's Catholic Shrine  St. Antony's shrine is the only structure on the island. It is a church named after St. Antony, considered a patron-saint of seafarers by the Christians. It was built by a prosperous Indian an Indian Catholic (Tamilian) fisherman Srinivasa Padaiyachi in the early 20th century. The annual church festival runs for three days. The priests from both India and Sri Lanka conduct the mass and car procession. Pilgrims from India are ferried mostly Rameswaram. According to the agreement between the Indian and Sri Lankan government, the citizens of India are not required to possess an Indian passport or Sri Lankan visa for visiting Kachchatheevu. The island lacks drinking water.

He first appeared in Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #2 (1986), and was created by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill. He operated as Ion, having become one of the most powerful characters in current continuity. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Sodam Yat as #32 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\". Fictional character biography =Introduction= Sodam Yat is a prophesied future member of the Green Lantern Corps, created by Alan Moore and is first mentioned in \\"Tygers\\", a story in Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #2. He is mentioned in passing to Abin Sur by a demon named Qull of the Five Inversions, who had been imprisoned on the planet Ysmault by the Guardians of the Universe. As a Daxamite (a race which descended from Kryptonians with inherent Superman-like powers) with a power ring, he would be nearly unstoppable. Despite this, in Qull's prophecy, he is still defeated as part of the final destruction of the Green Lantern Corps.Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #2 (1986) Alan Moore planned to use the character in his proposed story, \\"Twilight of the Superheroes\\", which went unpublished. In the proposal that was leaked onto the Internet, the Daxamite Green Lantern is named \\"Sodal Yat\\" and is also referred to as \\"The Ultimate Green Lantern\\". In that story, Sodal Yat is the last of an army of aliens to attack Superman. The Man of Steel defeats many Green Lanterns, Thanagarians, and the Martian Manhunter before finally being killed by Sodam Yat. The character would subsequently go unused until 2006. =Modern incarnation= As a young boy, Sodam Yat wants nothing more than to explore the stars, but the xenophobic Daxam society forbids it. When a spacecraft crashes on Daxam, Sodam rescues the pilot. The pilot, named Tessog, and Sodam become friends despite not speaking the same language. His parents discover Tessog and kill him, and then brainwash Sodam into thinking his friend was a violent menace. Years later, while on a school field trip to a museum, Sodam freezes at the sight of an anti-alien diorama featuring Tessog's stuffed and preserved body attacking a Daxamite. This discovery causes Sodam's true memories to resurface. Enraged and disgusted by what had happened, Sodam rebuilds Tessog's ship, planning to leave Daxam forever. On the night of his departure, a power ring comes to him, telling he has the ability to overcome great fear, and Sodam becomes a member of the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #18 (November 2007) Sodam Yat makes his first appearance in regular DC continuity in Green Lantern Corps #12 and part three of the Sinestro Corps War (Green Lantern Corps #14) when Kilowog gathers a group of Lanterns to strike back against Sinestro's forces attack in Space Sector 2263. Salaak singles out Arisia to keep an eye on the newly graduated Lantern Yat, though she wonders why Yat is so important. Salaak has been charged by the Guardians of the Universe to keep Qull's prophecy from coming to pass but keeps this to himself, only saying that one day she may know why he is so special. In Green Lantern Corps #16 he destroys the core of Ranx the Sentient City, ending the battle of Mogo. In Green Lantern Corps #17 Yat is chosen as the new host for the Ion entity by the Guardians of the Universe and fights Superboy-Prime.Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime (December 2007) The two battle each other fiercely through different areas of New York. Under the yellow light of the sun, Ion begins to unleash Superman-like powers, such as heat vision, to hurt his opponent. While the two trade blows, Ion is thrown into a nuclear power plant. The lead lining the walls causes Ion to weaken. Prime takes the opportunity to spear him with several uranium rods, severely injuring him. Ion tries to escape, only to have Prime knock him into a cemetery. They continue to do battle, each drawing blood from their opponent. Although Ion battles courageously, the lead poisoning and loss of blood begins to affect him and he is beaten unconscious. He is later seen receiving medical attention from Soranik Natu. After the events of the war, the Guardians request Kyle Rayner assist Yat in adjusting to his new role. While speaking about Yat's history and attitude as a Lantern, it is revealed that he must now permanently wear a power ring (despite his possession of the Ion powers) to prevent the lead in his body from killing him. They are then attacked by Alexander Nero who had been freed during the initial assault on Oa, but had not participated in the overall Sinestro Corps story. Rayner fights to less than his abilities to encourage Yat to embrace his status as Ion. Yat eventually defeats Nero by taking control of Nero's own constructs, something Rayner states that he had never attempted.Tales of the Green Lantern Corps: Ion (January 2008) Some time later, Yat and Arisia receive word of the Sinestro Corps' invasion of Daxam from Yat's mother, who had escaped using the ship that her son was going to use to escape Daxam. She is shocked when Yat refuses to return to Daxam. Instead, he lashes out at her, citing to Arisia his reasons for leaving his home planet. He even goes so far as to say that the Daxamites brought the invasion on themselves and that they are paying for their sins. Finally, he agrees to return on the condition that his mother, out loud, thank Tessog for providing her with a means of escape. After sending his mother to Oa, Yat and Arisia set out for Daxam. When Arisia asks him why he agreed to return, Yat states that his oath as a Green Lantern supersedes his hatred of Daxam and its people.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #34 (May 2009) Yat and Arisia arrive at Daxam after getting past the enormous snake-like Sinestro Corps member encircling the planet. Once on the surface, they find Yat's father who is promoting mass suicide as an alternative to living as Sinestro Corps slaves. The two Green Lanterns are able to save some, but not all, of his followers. Outraged, Yat declares that they will fight the Sinestro Corps.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #35 (June 2009) With the riot on Oa keeping any Green Lantern reinforcements from coming anytime soon, Yat takes on Mongul, the Sinestro Corps' new leader, head on, requesting that his ring grant him access to the Ion power. The ring refuses, stating that a Guardian (specifically Scar) is blocking his access to the Ion power and the only way to get past the block would be to remove his ring, which would kill him due to the enormous amounts of lead in his system from the battle with Superboy- Prime. His ring goes on to say that a massive power jolt could grant him limited access to the Ion power. With that, Yat drops his shields and takes the full power of Mongul's blast directly. The power jolt works and Yat rockets into the sky armed with 95% of the Ion power. As he heads for Daxam's sun, he removes his ring and tells Arisia to keep them fighting. Yat then plunges himself into the sun and uses the Ion power to turn Daxam's red sun into a yellow sun, giving the Daxamites a power boost to ward off Mongul and his Sinestro Corps. Sodam Yat is at first implied, then confirmed, as alive inside the sun of Daxam, unresponsive and constantly self-immolating, kept alive by Ion's power. The cloaked mastermind behind the Brightest Day, searching to trap and capture the whole emotional spectrum beings, exorcises Ion from Sodam, berating him for his sacrifice and his fellow Daxamites for their xenophobic view. As a result, a now restored Sodam Yat crashes on Daxam, still alive, but unconscious, several Daxamites die because of their sudden depowerment, as their sun turns red again.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #54 (July 2010) The still unconscious Sodam's body is carried away by two boys and hidden from the other Daxamites.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #1 (August 2010) Sodam awakens in a cavern, surrounded by many Daxamites who revere him for his sacrifice. They reveal to him that his father and the rest of Daxam society wish to find him and throw him back into the sun so they can get their powers back.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #3 (October 2010) Convinced that his survival was due to divine intervention, Sodam declares that, before Daxam can be cleansed of its xenophobia, the rest of the universe must be made a better place. He leads his followers on a journey to \\"make the Guardians pay for their sins\\".Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #4 (November 2010) While on this pilgrimage, Sodam is ambushed by the telepathic warlord Zardor, who later makes him attack Guy Gardner by having him believe Guy is a Guardian.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #6 (January 2011) However, when Arisia and Kilowog were able to break Zardor's control over Sodam, he fled using Sodam as his personal body guard. Zardor's last words for the corps were: \\"Enjoy the war\\".Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #7 (February 2011) =The New 52= Sodam Yat has since been reintroduced into the New 52 during the Green Lantern crossover Uprising. While his actions under Zardor's control are currently unknown, he was at some point captured by the Durlans. The Durlans kept him on the planet Corona Seven, of Space Sector 700 where they were able to remove his ring and broke Zardor's control over him. They also experimented on him in an attempt to learn how to mimic his form all the while interrogated him about his home planet of Daxam. After being release from his prison by the Green Lantern Corps, Sodam revealed to them that he had wondered if they all had forgotten about him. Arisia Rhab was overjoyed to see him alive.Green Lantern Corps #31 =DC Rebirth= Sodam Yat returns as a Green Lantern (sporting his Ion costume) in the final issue of Green Lanterns. He is one of the Green Lanterns who arrive on Earth to help Hal Jordan fight Cyborg Superman. When Cyborg Superman claims that no one can stop him because he has the powers of Superman, Sodam Yat refutes this by sending Henshaw crashing into a car with a single blow and blasting him with heat vision. Sodam Yat claims that as a Daxamite, he is Superman's equal and is one that can stop Cyborg Superman.Green Lanterns #57 Powers and abilities =Daxamite powers= Like their Kryptonian cousins, the Daxamites gain a large number of abilities when exposed to yellow sunlight including super strength; flight; super speed; super hearing; X-ray, heat, microscopic, and telescopic vision; and super breath. While the Daxamites are invulnerable while under yellow sunlight, the substance lead is still very lethal to them even in small quantities, as Kryptonite is to Kryptonians. Due to his exposure to lead from lead shielding at a nuclear power plant and uranium stabbed into him by Superboy-Prime, Yat must wear his Green Lantern ring at all times to stop the lead poisoning or he will die within a few minutes. =Ion powers= The benevolent Ion entity bestows its host with powers similar to a Green Lantern Corps Power Ring and the Starheart. With those powers, Sodam Yat has been described by some as the most powerful superhero in the universe. However, access to the powers can be controlled through his power ring, which he is required to wear constantly, allowing the Guardians of the Universe to shut off his Ion powers. In the Legion of Three Worlds miniseries, it is revealed that being host to the Ion entity has allowed Sodam to survive, unaging, into the 31st century. Other versions =Legion of 3 Worlds= In the future shown in the Legion of 3 Worlds miniseries, Sodam Yat is revealed as still alive, having been kept ageless by the Ion power, and residing in the ruined and lifeless husk that once was Oa, a rotten graveyard in which the dead Lanterns and their rings, unable to reach the new recruits since Mogo's destruction, come to rest. After the death of the last of the Green Lantern, Rond Vidar, Mon-El and Shadow Lass travel to Oa where they find Sodam Yat still alive and ask for his help. He states his unwillingness to act due to his unspecified past failures and spiritual unworthiness- possibly foreshadowing his actions in leading his people in war on the universe-, along with his role as the last Guardian of the Universe.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2 (November 2008) However, Mon- El is able to convince Yat to take up the fight against his old foe, Superboy- Prime, and the Legion of Super-Villains. Yat draws in all the power left in Oa's central power battery, absorbs the fallen rings (placing some on his fingers), and uses a modified oath.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #3 (April 2009) Yat aids the Legions in fighting Prime, realizing that the universe still needs a defense against this sort of evil. After the battle is finished, Yat retreats to Oa and begins to send rings across the universe to begin a new Green Lantern Corps.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (September 2009) References Category:Characters created by Alan Moore Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986 Category:Fictional avatars Category:DC Comics aliens Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:Green Lantern Corps officers ","title":"Sodam Yat"},{"id":"13896710","text":"The Jitin is a left tributary of the river Caraș (Karaš) in Romania.

Development The Rotax 582 is based upon the earlier Rotax 532 engine design and was designed for ultralight aircraft.Raisner, William: LEAF catalog, pages 6-105. Leading Edge Airfoils, 1995. The 582 increased the bore from the 532 engine's . This increased the displacement from to , an increase of 11%. The increased displacement had the effect of flattening out the 532's torque curve and allowed the 582 to produce useful power over a wider rpm range. Reliability over the 532 was also improved. The 582 features liquid-cooled cylinder heads and cylinders with a rotary intake valve. Cooling is via an externally mounted radiator. Lubrication is either by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil or oil injection from an externally mounted oil tank. The 582 has dual independent breakerless, magneto capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) systems and is equipped with two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure. An optional High Altitude Compensation kit is available. Early in the engine's production the propeller drive was via a Rotax type B gearbox, which offered gear ratios of 2.0:1, 2.238:1, and most common 2.58:1. Later in production type C or E gearboxes were offered with gear ratios of 2.62:1, 3.0:1, 3.47:1, and 4.0:1. (The type E gearbox includes an integrated electric starter motor.) The standard engine includes a wide band expansion chamber exhaust system with an extra after-muffler as optional. The standard starter is a recoil start type, with an electric starter optional.

Production On May 13, 2007, NBC renewed Law & Order for an 18th season of 22 episodes as part of a deal made by series creator Dick Wolf and NBC. Though the series was originally scheduled to air on Sundays as a midseason replacement for NBC Sunday Night Football, TV Guide reported on December 4, 2007, that Law & Order would debut instead on Wednesday, January 2, 2008. René Balcer, who had developed and produced spinoff Law & Order: Criminal Intent, returned to Law & Order this season as executive producer. Cast and crew changes In May 2007, cast member Fred Thompson departed the series to return to politics, with reports saying he would seek the Republican nomination for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. His character, District Attorney Arthur Branch, was replaced in that function by Sam Waterston's Jack McCoy, with McCoy being promoted to Branch's vacant seat after serving as Executive Assistant District Attorney since the resignation of his predecessor Benjamin Stone. Since this move required that a new character be added to the series, the writers created the role of EADA Michael Cutter and British actor Linus Roache was brought in to portray him. Because of the equal-time rule, which requires that broadcasters treat legally qualified political candidates equally in regard to air time, NBC announced in July 2007 that it would not broadcast any episode of Law & Order in which Thompson appeared after September 1. Thompson officially declared his intention to seek nomination on September 5, 2007, when he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Milena Govich, who played Detective Nina Cassady, also did not return to the series after joining the cast one year earlier following the departure of Dennis Farina (Joe Fontana). She was replaced by Jeremy Sisto, who had guest starred as a defense attorney in the 17th season finale, as Detective Ed Green's new partner Cyrus Lupo. Rounding out the list of departures was Jesse L. Martin, who announced he was leaving the series after portraying Det. Ed Green since 1999. Martin, who was scheduled to appear in only 13 episodes this season, announced the move in February 2008 and made his final appearance in \\"Burn Card\\". Anthony Anderson, who made his debut as Detective Kevin Bernard in the same episode, was then added to the cast. This remained the main cast until the end of the series. Cast =Main cast= * Jesse L.

The name is derived from the Nahuatl phrase \\"atlacomulli\\" which means \\"where there are wells.\\" The city, with a population of 20,477 is surrounded by rural area in which 75% of the rest of the municipality lives. The municipality has a sizable percentage of indigenous language speakers, mostly Mazahua. The Mazahua name for the area is Embaró, which means \\"colored rock.\\" Agriculture is still the main economic activity, but the development of a number of industrial parks, such as Atlacomulco 2000, which allowed the seat to reach city statues by 1987. Atlacomulco is also the origin of a political organization called the \\"Atlacomulco Group\\" made up of powerful political figures who deny its existence. History The area was originally settled by the Mazahuas but the date of their arrival is not known. This area eventually came under the control of Azcapotzalco during the reign of Tezozomoc, calling it the province of Mazahuacan. Later, it came under the control of Tlacopan or Tacuba. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Atlacomulco became the encomendero of Francisco de Villegas in 1535. In 1537, the regent of Ixtlahuaca took possession of the area, and relocated Spanish families here to settle. The municipality remained quiet through the rest of the colonial period and during the various wars of the 19th century. The only events of note were the passing of the armies of Miguel Hidalgo and Ignacio López Rayón on the edges of the municipality during the Mexican War of Independence. Atlacomulco officially became a municipality in 1824. During the very late 19th century and early 20th century, Atlacomulco was dominated by a number of large haciendas which include the Toshi Hacienda and the El Salto Hacienda. In 1915, during the Mexican Revolution, Lucio Blanco occupied the city of Atlacomulco with his groups while on his way to the Bajío region. He is known here for sacking almost all of the municipality's grain, as well as printing money which was circulated in the north of Mexico. During this time period, the municipality's most famous resident, Isidro Fabela Alfaro was active as a politician and writer. During the first half of the 20th century, most of the educational institutions here were established. In 1951, the village gained town status and in 1987, it was declared a city. Government As a municipality, the city of Atlacomulco is the local government for nearly 110 other communities in the area, which cover a territory of 258.74km2. Only about a quarter of the municipality's population of 77,831 lives in the city proper. The municipality has a large percentage of indigenous peoples for central Mexico, at 20%, compared to 3.8 percent for the rest of the State of Mexico, with 8,820 people speaking a native language , with Mazahua dominating. The municipality borders the municipalities of Acambay, Temascalcingo, San Andrés Timilpan, San Bartolo Morelos and El Oro. The municipality has rugged terrain, filled with mountains and hills. It is located on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, in the Lakes and Volcanos of Anáhuac region. Principle elevations include Cerro Xitije, Cerro Atlacomulco, Cerro La Cruz and Cerro El Cielito. Its altitude varies from 2720 to 3030 meters above sea level. It is part of the Lerma River basin which crosses the territory, as well as a number of streams and fresh-water springs. There three dams in the area, with the main one being J. Trinidad Fabela. Its climate is fairly moist with most rain falling between June and September. Average high temperatures is 19.9C and average low is 7.4C. Most of the vegetation is mixed- and conifer forests, covering about 20% of the municipality. The most common trees include cedars, holm oaks, eucalyptus, ash, strawberry trees, pines, oaks and weeping willows. Wild animals include small and medium-sized mammals such as squirrels, rabbits and foxes as well as reptiles such as chameleons, rattlesnakes and various small lizards. The northern part of the municipality near the Jocotitlán volcano is now a natural reserve where logging is prohibited and reforestation is underway. It is also a state park called the Isidro Fabela State Natural Park. Near the community of El Salto is the José Trinidad Fabela dam. In the middle of the lake created by the dam is the Isla de las Aves or Island of the Birds. This island is an ecological sanctuary for migratory birds and contains an aviary. Some of the birds kept and bred here are doves, guinea hens, peacocks and storks. Cabin rentals are available for visitors. Most of the municipality outside the city proper is dedicated to agriculture. Over 90% of what is grown is corn. Other crops include wheat, oats, barley and beans. Livestock is divided mostly among cattle, sheep and domestic fowl. Most of the crops and livestock are produced for auto-consumption. One notable exception is the flower growing region around the locality of San Lorenzo Tlacotepec, which ships fresh flowers to states such as Nuevo León, Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Agriculture employs about one quarter of the population and another quarter is employed by industries. The other half are employed in commerce, tourism and services.

Function  Xanthine dehydrogenase belongs to the group of molybdenum-containing hydroxylases involved in the oxidative metabolism of purines. The enzyme is a homodimer. Xanthine dehydrogenase can be converted to xanthine oxidase by reversible sulfhydryl oxidation or by irreversible proteolytic modification. Xanthine dehydrogenase catalyzes the following chemical reaction: 400px xanthine + NAD+ \\\\+ H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons urate + NADH + H+ The three substrates of this enzyme are xanthine, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its three products are urate, NADH, and H+. This enzyme participates in purine metabolism.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific, those acting on CH or CH2 groups with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is xanthine:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NAD+-xanthine dehydrogenase, xanthine-NAD+ oxidoreductase, xanthine/NAD+ oxidoreductase, and xanthine oxidoreductase. Clinical significance Defects in xanthine dehydrogenase cause xanthinuria, may contribute to adult respiratory stress syndrome, and may potentiate influenza infection through an oxygen metabolite-dependent mechanism. It has been shown that patients with lung adenocarcinoma tumors which have high levels of XDH gene expression, have lower survivals. Addiction to XDH protein has been used to target NSCLC tumors and cell lines in a precision oncology manner.

It was conceived and produced by Marlene and Dick Levine, who after attending the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island and the Fox Hollow Folk Festival in Petersburgh, New York, wanted to have a festival in their own community using local facilities. thumb Marlene and Richard met in college where together, they became interested in the Folk Revival of the 1950s. After Marlene graduated and Richard completed dental school, they settled in Hazlet, NJ, where Richard opened his practice and where they would raise their family. During this time, the two often traveled to Greenwhich Village in NYC where they frequented the folk club of Israel Young, seeing such performers as Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul and Mary and Pete Seeger. Soon, Richard and Marlene started performing themselves, Richard on guitar, concertina and a variety of other instruments and Marlene the autoharp. Eventually, they met two other couples who were playing folk music and starting in 1962, they gathered monthly to share songs. They called these gatherings hootnannies and was their first change to realize that music was more than performing, but rather a chance to come together with others in community. In time, the Levines began attending folk festivals; initially Newport and then Fox Hollow. In 1967, they determined to bring their love of folk music and community to the community where they lived (which was now Middletown, NJ), and they made plans for a folk concert which was held in June, 1967. They called it the $.99 Hootnanny. Response to the concert was so positive that beginning in 1968, they produced the Middletown Folk Festival. The festival consisted of a series of folk music concerts, workshops, a children's activity area and numerous crafts exhibits. In the first year 700 people attended. The Middletown Recreation Department provided support and services including the use of a municipal park with a mobile stage with the local Kiwanis and Junior Woman's club organizations handling the food concession. The festival was a community event with a true community flavor and family appeal with most of the attendees from the local area, with over 33,000 attending over the 17-year period in which the festival took place. This excerpt from the 1969 festival program (June 28, 1969) articulates the mission of the festival: thumb \\"What we are trying to do here today is to show you some of the tremendously varied kinds of folk music that people play for their own enjoyment right here in the Middletown area. You will be hearing everything from traditional ballads to Irish fiddling, from bagpipes to bluegrass, from Nashville country music to blues and gospel, and European lute to Indian sitar. During the afternoon you will have the opportunity of examining crafts as exhibited by local craftsmen. Among the displays will be one on dulcimer making, one on the construction of the \\"clogging man\\", as well as marionette making, quilting, rug braiding and special children's crafts. In short, our emphasis is on people doing things themselves, providing their own entertainment rather than sitting back and having someone else provide it for them. We hope more and more of you will realize that what we do ourselves is the most fun of all, and surely the most fulfilling.\\"thumb In spite of the Levine’s intention to create a small, community celebratory event, the community spirit was felt not only by the attendees but by the performers as well. Through the years, some of the nationally known folk and traditional music performers of the time included: Michael Cooney, Highwoods String Band, Utah Phillips, Barbara Carnes, Helen Schneyer, Jay Ungar, Molly Mason, and Lyn Hardy, and Mike and Alice Seeger. The Middletown Folk Festival ran from 1968-1984. As the local support for the event dwindled, Richard and Marlene felt that the time had come for the event to end. It seemed like the natural ending point and it wasn't so much sad that the festival stopped but it was more a celebration of good work done for the betterment of the community and for the world of folk music as well. The festival attracted media interest and had been televised on New Jersey Public Broadcasting and the National Educational Network. (1972-1973). Two recordings, produced in the earliest years, have been contributed to the Archive of Folksong at the Library of Congress and local libraries.

It is a statutory body under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Government of India, formed by the enactment of Food Corporation Act 1964 https://dfpd.gov.in/acts_C.htm in the Parliament of India. Its top official is designated as Chairman. It was set up in 1965 with its Initial headquarters at Chennai. Later this was moved to New Delhi. It also has regional centers in the capitals of the states. Important regions of the state also serve as district centers. Mandate The Food Corporation of India (FCI) was set up on 14 January 1965 having its first District Office at Thanjavur – rice bowl of Tamil Nadu – and headquarters at Chennai (later shifted to Delhi) under the Food Corporations Act 1964 to implement the following objectives of the National Food Policy : # Effective price support operations for safeguarding the interests of the poor farmers # Distribution of foodgrains throughout the country for Public Distribution System (PDS) # Maintaining a satisfactory level of operational and buffer stocks of foodgrains to ensure National Food Security # Regulate market price to provide foodgrains to consumers at a reliable price Statistics It is one of the largest Corporations in India started by the government and probably the largest supply chain management in Asia. It operates through five Zonal offices and 24 Regional offices. Each year, the Food Corporation of India purchases roughly 15 to 20 percent of India's wheat output and 12 to 15 percent of its rice output. The purchases are made from the farmers at the rates declared by the Government of India. This rate is called MSP (Minimum Support Price). There is no limit for procurement in terms of volume, any quantity can be procured by FCI (Food Corporation of India) provided the stock satisfies FAQ (Fair Average Quality) specifications with respect to FCI. Organizational structure Food Corporation of India operates through its Depot headed by Manager (Depot). Every district has few depots to cater to the requirement of the district's rural population. The depot reports to Divisional Office, headed by an Assistant General Manager, designated earlier as an Area Manager and now as Divisional Manager. Assistant General Manager (Quality Control) is also posted who is looking after the QC work that includes ensuring the food grains are pest free and subjected to regular pest control measures. Under Divisional Manager's control, there are Managers to deal with each and every section viz., Depot, Sales, Contracts, Procurement, SL-TL, Movement, Establishment, Quality Control (QC), Operational accounts, Civil Engineering and Electrical & Mechanical Engineering etc., who consolidate the field level operations and through the Divisional Managers' authorization, they transmit the necessary information and periodical statements to Regional Offices of their respective regions. Under Managers are Assistant Grades Level -1 and Junior Engineer (Both Civil and Electrical & Mechanical), Level -2 and Level - 3 who help managers in day-to-day operations of the organization. There are 21,847 employees working in FCI as of 2019. The divisional office reports to regional offices which are headed by a General Manager, who is in most of the cases from Indian Revenue Service, Indian Administrative Service /All India Services under deputation. Under his control Deputy General Managers (DGM) who are FCI's officers co-ordinate with daily operations through the Assistant General Managers who were posted in various sections to oversee the functions of district offices units of their particular section. All these officers appraise the general manager periodically on various issues pertaining to district offices of that particular region. FCI has been divided into 5 zones viz. North, South, East, West & North-East with a Zonal Office in each zone. Locations of FCI, Zonal Offices: # Zonal Office, North: Noida # Zonal Office, East: Kolkata # Zonal Office, West: Mumbai # Zonal Office, North-East: Guwahati # Zonal Office, South: Chennai Each zone is further divided into regions with a regional office in one region. All the Regional Offices are under the control of Zonal Offices which are headed by an Executive Director, who in most of the cases is from Indian Administrative Service or Indian Revenue Service under deputation. Under his control three or more than three General Managers co-ordinate with all Regional Offices of their particular zone through subordinate officers like Deputy General Managers and Assistant General Managers dealing with their allotted operational sections in their respective zone. All the Zonal Offices are under the control of Headquarters, located at New Delhi, which is headed by Chairman and Managing Director, who is an Indian Administrative Service of Secretary rank on Central Deputation. Headquarters instruct, communicate, consolidate and refine the voluminous information required for the streamlined execution of day-to-day operations and coordinates with Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Food Secretary and various sister corporations like Central Warehousing Corporation, Indian Railways in formulating food policy or amending the existing policy to suit the emerging challenges in managing Food Security scenario of the nation. The CMD is a member of the Board of Directors along with Director Finance, Director HR, Director Operations and Director Sales. Operations The Food Corporation of India procures rice and wheat from farmers through many routes like paddy purchase centres/mill levy/custom milling and stores them in depots. FCI maintains many types of depots like food storage depots and buffer storage complexes and private equity godowns and also implemented latest storage methods of silo storage facilities which are located at Hapur in Uttar Pradesh, Malur in Karnataka and Elavur in Tamil Nadu. The stocks are transported throughout India by means of railways, roadways and waterways and issued to the state government nominees at the rates declared by the Government of India for further distribution under the Public Distribution System (PDS) for the consumption of the ration card holders. (FCI itself does not directly distribute any stock under PDS, and its operations end at the exit of the stock from its depots). The difference between the purchase price and sale price, along with internal costs, are reimbursed by the Union Government in the form of food subsidy. At present the annual subsidy is around $10 billion. FCI by itself is not a decision-making authority; it does not decide anything about the MSP, imports or exports. It just implements the decisions made by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Ministry of Agriculture. Food Corporation of India recently ventured into procurement of pulses in various regions from the crop year 2015–16, and pulses are procured at market rate, which is a sharp deviation from its traditional minimum support price-based procurement system. In 2014, Government of India set up a high-level committee under the chairmanship of Hon'ble Member of Parliament and former Minister of Food and Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution Shri Shanthakumar to recommend viable solutions regarding restructuring and reorienting the role of Food Corporation of India, and the committee submitted its report to the government, and many of the committee recommendations are under various stages of implementation. On 27 November 2019, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved to increase the authorized capital of Food Corporation of India (FCI) from existing Rs.3,500 crore to Rs.10,000 crore.

It originally aired on October 31, 2007.Episode Guide. South Park Studios. The episode was rated TV- MA LV in the United States. It is the third and final episode in a three-part story arc that won the 2008 Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program for One Hour or More. The three episodes were later reissued together, along with previously unreleased footage, as the uncensored Imaginationland: The Movie. In the episode, Stan and Butters engage in the battle of their lives as they fight the army of evil imaginary forces. Meanwhile, Cartman remains determined to get Kyle, and do good for his bet. Plot In the conclusion from the previous two episodes, in which terrorists attacked the embodiment of human imagination, Imaginationland, and destroyed the barrier within that realm separating evil fictional characters from the good innocent ones, the armies of evil characters march towards Castle Sunshine, where the last surviving good characters have taken refuge. There, Butters Stotch has been informed that he is the key to repelling the evil hordes because, as a real person, he has the power to conjure up good characters from his imagination to fight the evil army approaching Castle Sunshine. Meanwhile, in the real world, Al Gore, who has previously attempted to warn the public of the danger of ManBearPig, shows his staff the video made of that creature's appearance at The Pentagon in the previous episode, and embarks on an investigation of those events on behalf of the American people. Kyle Broflovski awakens from his coma to see that Eric Cartman is making preparations in anticipation of Kyle sucking his testicles, completely ignoring the Imaginationland crisis and setting up a photo-shoot. Kyle finds that he has a telepathic link to Stan in Imaginationland, who alerts him to the events transpiring in that realm, where the good characters, outnumbered and largely untrained for combat, charge the evil army. After Al Gore leaks the ManBearPig video to the public, The Pentagon informs the public of the recent events in Imaginationland and their plans to attack that realm with a nuclear weapon, setting off a public and legal controversy over whether the federal government has the jurisdiction to do this. Legal pundits discuss the state court case stemming from Cartman and Kyle's bet, Cartman v. Broflovski which ruled that imaginary characters are indeed real, which would preclude the government from taking action against the public's imagination. On the battlefield, the good characters seem doomed. Led by Jesus, the good characters charge, but they are suffering from many casualties. Aslan orders Butters he must imagine Santa which Butters imagines, yet this version is a monstrous cephalopod creature. Butters is terrified and it abruptly fades away. However, Butters manages to master his conjuring ability, and summons appropriate forces that join the battle, and turn the tide in good's favor by focusing and imaging on the good. The Supreme Court overturns the \\"Cartman vs. Broflovski decision\\" that imaginary creatures are real – imaginary creatures are declared not really real, so the government can bomb Imaginationland. Kyle is no longer legally required to suck Cartman's testicles, and he is instructed by Stan to stall the launch. Kyle and Cartman break into the Pentagon again and Kyle, who finally agrees with him and convinces the officials to not bomb Imaginationland by arguing that imaginary creatures are just as real as real people because of the impact they have on people's lives. Cartman responds by telling Kyle that since imaginary creatures are real after all, then he loses their bet, and still has to suck Cartman's testicles. Kyle finally snaps and berates Cartman for not caring about the danger Stan and Butters are in just because of a stupid bet and that he doesn't care who won, because Kyle would rather go to jail than humiliate himself by sucking Cartman's testicles. Shocked that the missile launch is being abruptly cancelled, Al Gore saying, \\"ManBearPig has to die\\", launches the bomb himself, causing the portal to destabilize and sucks everyone in the room, as well as the nuclear missile, into Imaginationland. The good characters' victory is interrupted by the missile's explosion, destroying everything in Imaginationland and killing everyone in it (including the people from the real world), and leaving nothing but a vast white emptiness. Butters survives the explosion and restores the realm with his imagination, back to how it was before the initial terrorist attack. Realizing the power of the realm, Cartman creates duplicates of himself and Kyle, in which imaginary Kyle sucks imaginary Cartman's testicles (off-screen). Kyle angrily states the scene is imaginary, to which Cartman insists that, in one's imagination, imaginary creatures are \\"real\\", as Kyle himself said earlier, therefore Kyle's agreement with Cartman is finally fulfilled. The Mayor agrees that at least here in Imaginationland, it is real. Santa then states that it's time for the boys to go home. Butters suddenly wakes up in the real world, in his bedroom. His parents come in, and he tells them about the dream he just had. They inform Butters that it wasn't a dream, as they read about it in a newspaper, but they proceed to ground him anyway for not coming back from Imaginationland in time to clean out the basement. Enraged by this, Butters tries to use his powers to get out of being grounded, but is told by his parents that his powers only work in Imaginationland, and not in the real world. Disappointed, Butters lies back in bed and ends the episode with a low, unhappy and uncensored mutter of \\"Aw, shit\\". Cultural references The battle for imaginationland parodies the battle at Helms Deep from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and the imaginationland castle is based after Rivendell, additionally Gandalf appears as one of the imaginary characters. Al Gore when he shows a video of 'man-bear-pig' attacking the army base the dialog echoes directly the Operatives opening lines from Serenity.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995579/trivia?tab=mc&ref;_=tt_trv_cnn Reception and release IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.5/10 calling it \\"another ambitious effort, with lofty themes, goofy humor and plenty of sequences that just seem to pack jokes and references into every frame\\". Josh Modell of The A.V. Club gave the trilogy a B grade, criticizing the slow pace of the main plot and calling it \\"more like an excuse for a nostalgia trip than a good arc.\\" However, he praised Cartman's endless pursuit of his bet with Kyle and the return of the Christmas critters, calling their appearance, \\"some of the funniest moments in South Park's recent history,\\" The Imaginationland Trilogy won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour or More). \\"Imaginationland Episode III\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's eleventh season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 12, 2008.

He was publisher of the Bend Bulletin newspaper for 34 years. Sawyer supported free enterprise, low taxes, limited government, and the Republican Party. He was elected Deschutes County judge shortly after the county was created, and later served on numerous national boards and commission. To recognize his outstanding contribution to journalism, Sawyer was inducted into the Oregon Newspaper Hall of Fame.  Early life and legal career Robert William Sawyer Jr. was born in Bangor, Maine on May 12, 1880, the oldest child of Robert William Sawyer (1850-1918) and Martha Copp (Paul) Sawyer. His father was involved at various times in the railroad, pulp and paper, and telegraph industries in Maine. Like his father, Sawyer attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College, graduating from Harvard in 1902 and from Harvard Law School in 1906. He worked as a lawyer in the firm Brandeis Dunbar & Nutter led by future U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis.  Marital Scandal  Sawyer married Louise Cushing Dunn (1878-1914) in 1905. They had two sons, Robert III, born 1906, and George, born 1908. In October 1910, Sawyer disappeared along with the wife of his Cambridge neighbor and fellow Brandeis Dunbar & Nutter attorney Edward F. McClennen. (The firm, still in existence, is now known as Nutter McClennen & Fish). Newspaper articles reported that Sawyer and Mary McClennen had been spending a lot of time together since the previous summer.\\"Lawyer elopes with his partner's wife,\\" Boston Post, October 28, 1910 Mary McClennen (née Mary Bigelow Young) had two daughters with McClennen and was apparently two months pregnant when she fled with Sawyer. (Grace Sawyer, her daughter with him, was born in May 1911 in California.) Louise Sawyer was also pregnant at the time. (She gave birth to a third son, Alfred, in March 1911.) McClennen filed for divorce in 1910 and remarried in 1911.\\"To marry chum of ex-wife,\\" Boston Post, August 5, 1911 The former Mary McClennen, now Mary Sawyer, died in 1977 at the age of 99.

His first job in Bend was as a labor at a local sawmill. In his spare time, he began writing short newspaper articles for the Bend Bulletin. Initially, he anonymously slipped the draft articles under the door of the newspaper office. The editor, George P. Putnam, liked the articles and published them. Eventually, Putnam caught Sawyer delivering one of his anonymous articles and hired him as an associate editor. In 1919, Sawyer purchased Putnam’s interest in the newspaper. Sawyer remained publisher of the Bend Bulletin for the next 34 years. In 1916, Sawyer was instrumental in separating Deschutes County from Crook County. He also helped establish St. Charles Hospital in Bend. He was elected as Deschutes County judge in 1920, serving in that position until 1927. Sawyer was also appointed to the commission that planned the reconstruct of the Oregon State Capitol, after it burned in 1935. In 1949, Governor Douglas McKay appointed Sawyer chairman of the Oregon’s State Planning Commission to design a new capital campus in Salem, Oregon. Sawyer was a champion of free enterprise, low taxes, limited government, and the Republican Party. In 1948, Sawyer supported Thomas E. Dewey for President of the United States. As one of Dewey’s major backers, many felt Sawyer was the leading candidate for appointed as Secretary of the Interior if Dewey had won the election. In 1953, Sawyer put the Bend Bulletin up for sale. He received offers from several large newspaper chains, but eventually sold the newspaper to Robert W. Chandler. To make the purchase affordable, Sawyer only required a $6,000 down payment.  Conservationist  Sawyer was a conservationist, who used his influence as a newspaper publisher to help preserve Oregon’s natural resources. In addition to supporting these causes in the Bend Bulletin, he served as president of the National Reclamation Association; he was a director of the American Forestry Association; and he was secretary-treasurer for the Central Oregon Development League.

The action was one of the last of a series of engagements between U.S. and Japanese forces near the Matanikau River during the campaign. In the engagement, seven battalions of U.S. Marine and Army troops under the overall command of Alexander Vandegrift and tactical command of Merritt A. Edson, following up on the U.S. victory in the Battle for Henderson Field, crossed the Matanikau River and attacked Japanese Army units between the river and Point Cruz, on the northern Guadalcanal coast. The area was defended by the Japanese Army's 4th Infantry Regiment under Nomasu Nakaguma along with various other support troops, under the overall command of Harukichi Hyakutake. After inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese defenders, U.S. forces halted the offensive and temporarily withdrew because of a perceived threat from Japanese forces elsewhere in the Guadalcanal area. Background =Guadalcanal campaign= On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.Hogue, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, pp. 235–36. Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8August the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift and mainly consisting of United States Marine Corps units, had secured Tulagi and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The airfield was later named Henderson Field by Allied forces. The Allied aircraft that subsequently operated out of the airfield became known as the \\"Cactus Air Force\\" (CAF) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point.Morison, Struggle for Guadalcanal, pp. 14–15; Shaw, First Offensive, p. 18. In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army, a corps- sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces. Beginning on 19 August, various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving Allied forces from the island.Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 96–99; Dull, Imperial Japanese Navy, p. 225; Miller, Guadalcanal: The First Offensive, pp. 137–38. Map of Guadalcanal and nearby islands. The Matanikau/Point Cruz and Lunga Point areas are in the northwest (upper left) of the island. Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light cruisers or destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, were usually able to make the round trip down \\"The Slot\\" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the \\"Tokyo Express\\" by Allied forces and \\"Rat Transportation\\" by the Japanese.Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 202, 210–11. The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on 21 August in the Battle of the Tenaru. The next attempt took place from 12–14 September, with the 6,000 soldiers under the command of Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi being defeated in the Battle of Edson's Ridge. After their defeat at Edson's Ridge, Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops regrouped west of the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal.Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 141–43, 156–58, 228–46, 681. As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on 19 September, to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 156; Smith, Bloody Ridge, pp. 198–200. General Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct a series of small unit operations around the Matanikau Valley.Smith, Bloody Ridge, p. 204; Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 270. Dead soldiers from the Japanese 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment lie piled in a ravine after being killed by mortar and small arms fire from U.S. Marines on 9October 1942Hammel, Guadalcanal, p. 106. The first U.S. Marine operation against Japanese forces west of the Matanikau, conducted between 23 September and 27 September 1942 by elements of three U.S. Marine battalions, was repulsed by Kawaguchi's troops under Colonel Akinosuke Oka's local command. In the second action, between 6October and October, a larger force of U.S. Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the 2nd (Sendai) Infantry Division under the command of generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese 4th Infantry Regiment. The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau.Zimmerman, The Guadalcanal Campaign, pp. 96–101; Smith, Bloody Ridge, pp. 204–15; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 269–90; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 169–76; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, pp. 318–22. The 2nd Infantry was called Sendai because most of its soldiers were from Miyagi Prefecture. In the meantime, Major General Millard F. Harmon, commander of United States Army forces in the South Pacific, convinced Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific Area, that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the anticipated Japanese offensive. Thus on 13 October, a naval convoy delivered the 2,837-strong 164th U.S. Infantry Regiment, a North Dakota Army National Guard formation from the U.S. Army's Americal Division, to Guadalcanal.Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 293–97; Morison, Struggle for Guadalcanal, pp. 147–49; Miller, Guadalcanal: The First Offensive, pp. 140–42; Dull, Imperial Japanese Navy, p. 225. =Battle for Henderson Field= Between 1 October and 17 October, the Japanese delivered 15,000 troops to Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Therefore, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the 38th Infantry Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defences from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River.Shaw, First Offensive, p. 34; Rottman, Japanese Army, p. 63. To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) from the 4th and 124th Infantry Regiments under the overall command of Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor.Rottman, Japanese Army, p. 61; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 289–340; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, pp. 322–30; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 186–87; Dull, Imperial Japanese Navy, pp. 226–30; Morison, Struggle for Guadalcanal, pp. 149–71. The Japanese troops delivered to Guadalcanal during this time comprised the entire 2nd (Sendai) Infantry Division, two battalions from the 38th Infantry Division, and various artillery, tank, engineer, and other support units. Kawaguchi's forces also included what remained of the 3rd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment which was originally part of the 35th Infantry Brigade commanded by Kawaguchi during the Battle of Edson's Ridge. Map of the battle, 23–26 October. Sumiyoshi forces attack in the west at the Matanikau (left) while Maruyama's 2nd division attacks the Lunga perimeter from the south (right) Sumiyoshi's forces, including two battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Nomasu Nakaguma, launched attacks on the U.S. Marine defenses at the mouth of the Matanikau on the evening of 23 October. U.S. Marine artillery, cannon, and small arms fire repulsed the assaults and killed many of the attacking Japanese soldiers while suffering only light casualties themselves.Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, pp. 332–33; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 349–50; Rottman, Japanese Army, pp. 62–63; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 195–96; Miller, Guadalcanal: The First Offensive, pp. 157–58. The Marines lost 2killed in the action. Japanese infantry losses are not recorded but were, according to Frank, \\"unquestionably severe.\\" Griffith says that 600 Japanese soldiers were killed. Beginning on 24 October and continuing over two consecutive nights, Maruyama's forces conducted numerous, unsuccessful frontal assaults on the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter. More than 1,500 of Maruyama's troops were killed in the attacks while the Americans lost about 60 killed.Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 336; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 353–62; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 197–204; Miller, Guadalcanal: The First Offensive, pp. 160–62; Miller, Cactus Air Force, pp. 147–51; Lundstrom, Guadalcanal Campaign, pp. 343–52. Further Japanese attacks near the Matanikau on 26 October by Oka's 124th Infantry Regiment were also repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese. Thus, at 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called off any further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. About half of Maruyama's survivors were ordered to retreat back to the area west of the Matanikau River while the rest, the 230th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Toshinari Shoji, was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga perimeter. The 4th Infantry Regiment retreated back to positions west of the Matanikau and around the Point Cruz area while the 124th Infantry Regiment took up positions on the slopes of Mount Austen in the upper Matanikau Valley.Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 363–406, 418, 424, 553; Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, pp. 122–23; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 204; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 337; Rottman, Japanese Army, p. 63. U.S. Marine Colonel Merritt Edson (left), photographed near the mouth of the Matanikau a few days before the November offensiveHammel, Guadalcanal, p. 121. In order to exploit the recent victory Vandegrift planned another offensive west of the Matanikau which would have two objectives: to drive the Japanese beyond artillery range of Henderson Field and to cut off the retreat of Maruyama's men towards the village of Kokumbona, location of the 17th Army's headquarters. For the offensive, Vandegrift committed the three battalions of the 5th Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Merritt Edson, plus the augmented 3d Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment (called the Whaling Group) commanded by Colonel William Whaling. Two battalions of the 2nd Marine Regiment would be in reserve. The offensive was supported by artillery from the 11th Marine Regiment and the 164th Infantry Regiment, CAF aircraft, and gunfire from U.S. Navy warships. Edson was placed in tactical command of the operation.Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 343; Hammel, Guadalcanal, p. 135; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 214–15; Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 411; Anderson, Guadalcanal, Shaw, First Offensive, pp. 40–41; Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, pp. 130–31. Defending the Matanikau area for the Japanese were the 4th and 124th Infantry Regiments. Nakaguma's 4th Infantry defended the Matanikau from the shore to about inland while Oka's 124th Infantry extended the line further inland along the river. Both regiments, which on paper consisted of six battalions, were severely understrength because of battle damage, tropical disease, and malnutrition. In fact, Oka described his command as at only \\"half strength.\\"Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 411. Action Between 01:00 and 06:00 on 1 November, U.S. Marine engineers constructed three footbridges across the Matanikau. At 06:30, nine Marine and U.S. Army artillery batteries (about 36 guns) and U.S. warships , , and opened fire on the west bank of the Matanikau, and U.S. aircraft, including 19 B-17 heavy bombers, dropped bombs in the same area. At the same time, the 1st Battalion (1/5) of the 5th Marine Regiment crossed the Matanikau at its mouth while the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines (2/5) and the Whaling Group crossed the river further inland. Facing the Marines was the Japanese 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry under Major Masao Tamura.Shaw, First Offensive, pp. 40–41; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 215; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 344; Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, p. 131; Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 412; Hammel, Guadalcanal, p. 138. Map of the U.S. Matanikau offensive The 2/5 and the Whaling Group encountered very little resistance and reached and occupied several ridges south of Point Cruz by early afternoon. Along the coast near Point Cruz, however, the 7th Company from Tamura's battalion fiercely resisted the U.S. advance. In several hours of fighting, Company C, 1/5 suffered heavy casualties, including the loss of three officers, and was driven back toward the Matanikau by Tamura's troops. Assisted by another company from 1/5 and later by two companies from the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5), plus determined resistance by Marine Corporal Anthony Casamento, among others, the Americans were successful in stopping the retreat.Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, pp. 131–32; Hammel, Guadalcanal, pp. 138–39; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 412–13; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 215; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 345; Shaw, First Offensive, pp. 40–41. Reviewing the situation at the end of the day, Edson, along with Colonel Gerald Thomas and Lieutenant Colonel Merrill Twining from Vandegrift's staff, decided to try to encircle the Japanese defenders around Point Cruz. They ordered 1/5 and 3/5 to continue to press the Japanese along the coast the next day while 2/5 wheeled north to envelop their adversaries west and south of Point Cruz. Tamura's battalion had taken heavy losses in the day's fighting, with Tamura's 7th and 5th Companies being left with only 10 and 15 uninjured soldiers respectively.Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 215; Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 413. The Point Cruz area on Guadalcanal looking south. The pocket of Japanese resistance was located at the base of Point Cruz in the lower center of the picture Fearing that the U.S. troops were on the verge of breaking through their defenses, Hyakutake's 17th Army headquarters hurriedly sent whatever troops could be found on-hand to bolster the 4th Infantry's defensive efforts. The troops included the 2d Anti-Tank Gun Battalion with 12 guns and the 39th Field Road Construction Unit. These two units took position in pre-prepared fighting emplacements around the south and west of Point Cruz.Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 413. On the morning of 2 November, with the Whaling Group covering their flank, the men of 2/5 marched north and reached the coast west of Point Cruz, completing the encirclement of the Japanese defenders. The Japanese defenses were centered in a draw between a coastal trail and a beach just west of Point Cruz and included coral, earth, and log bunkers as well as caves and foxholes. U.S. artillery bombarded the Japanese positions throughout the day on 2November, causing an unknown number of casualties to the Japanese defenders.Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, p. 132; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 215–16; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 345; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 413–14. Later in the day, Company I of 2/5 conducted a frontal assault with fixed bayonets on the northern portion of the Japanese defenses, overrunning and killing the Japanese defenders. At the same time, two battalions from 2nd Marine Regiment, now committed to the offensive, advanced past the Point Cruz area.Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 345; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 413–14; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 216; Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, pp. 132–33. At 06:30 on 3 November, some Japanese troops attempted to break out of the pocket but were beaten back by the Marines. Between 08:00 and noon, five Marine companies from 2/5 and 3/5, using small arms, mortars, demolition charges, and direct and indirect artillery fire, completed the destruction of the Japanese pocket near Point Cruz. Marine participant Richard A. Nash described the battle: The Marines captured 12 37mm anti-tank guns, one 70 mm field artillery piece, and 34 machineguns and counted the dead bodies of 239 Japanese soldiers, including 28 officers.Hammel, Guadalcanal, p. 139; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 216; Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 416; Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, p. 133; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 345; Shaw, First Offensive, p. 41. Two U.S. Marines check a Japanese coral block bunker near Point Cruz after the battle on 3NovemberHammel, Guadalcanal, p. 136. At the same time, the 2nd Marines with the Whaling Group continued to push along the coast, reaching a point west of Point Cruz by nightfall. The only Japanese troops left in the area to oppose the Marines' advance were the remaining 500 soldiers of the 4th Infantry augmented by a few frail survivors from units involved in the earlier Tenaru and Edson's Ridge battles plus malnourished naval troops from the original Guadalcanal garrison. The Japanese feared that they would be unable to prevent the Americans from taking the village of Kokumbona, which would cut-off the retreat of the 2nd Infantry Division and seriously threaten the rear-area support and headquarters units of Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. In despair, Nakaguma discussed taking the regimental colors and seeking death in a final charge at the U.S. forces, but was dissuaded from doing so by other officers on the 17th Army's staff.Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 216; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 416–18. A significant event now occurred which granted the Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3November, Marine units near Koli Point, east of the Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that a large body of Japanese troops was in the process of relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 413–20; Shaw, First Offensive, p. 41; Hammel, Guadalcanal, p. 139; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 345; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, pp. 216–17. To discuss these developments, the Marine leaders on Guadalcanal met on the morning of 4November. Twining recommended that the Matanikau offensive continue. Edson, Thomas, and Vandegrift, however, urged the abandonment of the offensive and a shift of forces to counter the Koli Point threat. Thus, that same day the 5th Marines and the Whaling group were recalled to Lunga Point. The 2nd Marine's 1st and 2nd Battalions, plus the 1st Battalion, 164th Infantry took up positions about west of Point Cruz with plans to hold in that location. With their route of retreat still open, the Sendai (2nd) Division survivors began to reach Kokumbona this same day. Around this time, Nakaguma was killed by an artillery shell.Anderson, Guadalcanal; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, p. 345; Griffith, Battle for Guadalcanal, p. 218; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 413–20; Hammel, Guadalcanal, p. 139; Shaw, First Offensive, p. 41. Frank states that Nakaguma was killed on 7November. Aftermath U.S. Marines drag the bodies of dead Japanese soldiers from their bunker in the Point Cruz area after the battle in early November. After chasing away the Japanese forces at Koli Point, the U.S. renewed the western offensive towards Kokumbona on 10 November with three battalions under the overall command of U.S. Marine Colonel John M. Arthur. In the meantime, fresh Japanese troops from the 228th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Infantry Division landed by Tokyo Express over several nights beginning on 5November and effectively resisted the American attack. After making small advances, at 13:45 on 11 November Vandegrift suddenly ordered all the American forces to return to the east bank of the Matanikau.Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 421, 424–25; Anderson, Guadalcanal; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, pp. 350–51; Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, p. 150. Vandegrift ordered the withdrawal because of the receipt of intelligence from coastwatchers, aerial reconnaissance, and radio intercepts that a major Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent. Indeed, the Japanese were in the process of attempting to deliver the 10,000 remaining troops from the 38th Division to Guadalcanal in order to reattempt to capture Henderson Field. The resulting efforts by the Americans to stop this reinforcement attempt resulted in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the decisive naval battle of the Guadalcanal campaign, in which the Japanese reinforcement effort was turned back.Anderson, Guadalcanal; Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, pp. 350–51; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 425–27. The Americans recrossed the Matanikau and attacked westward again beginning on 18 November, but made slow progress against determined resistance from Japanese forces. The U.S. attack was halted on 23 November at a line just west of Point Cruz. The Americans and Japanese would remain facing each other in these positions for the next six weeks, until the ending stages of the campaign when U.S. forces began their final, successful push to drive Japanese forces from the island. Although the Americans had come close to overrunning the Japanese rear areas in the early November offensive, it would not be until the final stages of the campaign that the U.S. finally captured Kokumbona.Hough, Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal, pp. 357–58, 368; Frank, Guadalcanal, pp. 493–97, 570; Shaw, First Offensive, p. 50; Anderson, Guadalcanal; Zimmerman, Guadalcanal Campaign, pp. 150–52; Jersey, Hell's Islands, pp. 309–310. The American forces involved in the 18 November attack included the US Army's 2nd Battalion, 182nd Infantry plus three battalions from the 8th Marine Regiment. The US Army's 1st and 3rd Battalions, 164th Infantry joined the attack on 20 November.

Biography The young Albert, son of noblemen spent much of his youth at the court of the duke of Neuburg. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1646, and while studying theology at the Catholic University of Leuven he attended the 'Chinese lectures' given by Martino Martini an Italian Jesuit missionary, then visiting the University of Leuven. This evoked in him a strong desire to volunteer for the China mission. Permission was granted by his Provincial and soon after being ordained priest (in 1654) Dorville rejoined Martino Martini in Rome before accompanying him on his return journey to China. Leaving Lisbon in April 1657, Martini, Dorville and 17 other Jesuits (among whom Ferdinand Verbiest) arrived in Macau on 17 July 1658, after a long and arduous journey during which several lost their life. As was the practice for all newly arrived men Dorville spent some time in Macau to learn the Chinese language. He was then sent as missionary in the province of Shanxi. Exploratory overland journey Soon he was called to Peking and appointed to accompany Johann Grueber on a journey back to Europe. Grueber was sent to Rome in order to defend Jesuit astronomer Adam Schall against the accusation of 'fostering superstitious practices' (motivated by his working on the Chinese calendar). As traveling over the seas was increasingly difficult and unsafe - the Portuguese were losing their trade monopoly at the hands of the Dutch - they decided to attempt an exploratory overland journey that, if successful could bring China closer to Europe too. The first stretch would lead them to Goa. Leaving Peking on 13 April 1661 Grueber and Dorville entered Tibet 13 July and spent two months (October and November) in its capital Lhasa. All along the way Dorville did some geographical investigations, determining exactly the longitude and latitude of the places they were passing through. The travelers crossed the Himalayas, entered Nepal and stayed a month in Kathmandu (January 1662). From there they descended into the basin of the Ganges river, entered India (8 February) and visited Patna, and Benares before arriving finally in Agra (31 March), the former capital of the Mughal empire. Dorville was however seriously sick and exhausted by the harrowing journey: he died 8 April 1662, a week after reaching Agra. Evaluation For the rest of the journey back from Goa to Europe, Grueber was accompanied by Heinrich Roth, a Jesuit Sanskrit scholar. On arrival in Rome in 1664 Grueber gave an account of their odyssey. Numerous and interesting observations - geographical, cultural, socio-religious - were made on the countries traveled across and people encountered. With regard to finding a shorter route to China the exploratory journey was a failure: travelers continued, and for many years, to go by ship form Goa to Macau and China... The overland journey was too long, hazardous and thoroughly exhausting...  Bibliography  *WESSELS, C.: Early Jesuit travellers in Central Asia (1603–1721), The Hague, 1924, pp. 164–202. *BRAUMANN, F.

It was established by consuls Lucius Licinius Crassus and Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex in 95 BC. This law is regarded as a cause of the Social War (91–88 BC).  Causes of the creation of the law  The emerging trend of xenophobia in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC led to the increasing marginalisation of Italians who, as Rome's primary fighters and tax payers, sought partnership and not subjection. Attempts to grant rights to surrounding allies had been continually thwarted in the past. In the mid-2nd century Gaius Gracchus had attempted to grant rights to Latin allies: > “He also called on the Latin allies to demand the full rights of Roman > citizenship, since the Senate could not with decency refuse this privilege > to men who were of the same race. To the other allies, who were not allowed > to vote in Roman elections, he sought to give the right of suffrage, in > order to have their help in the enactment of laws which he had in > contemplation. The Senate was very much alarmed at this.”Appian. B.C. 23.1 The result of this attempt was the active opposition of the aristocracy and Gaius's subsequent suicide and the mutilation of his body. Alongside the Gracchi's revolutionary re-evaluation of land ownership, which sought to take land over 500 jugeraAppian B.C. 8.1 out the hands of the Roman elite and into those of the urban poor, this new use of the Tribunate raised questions about citizens' rights. What did it mean to be a citizen? What was the relationship between citizenship and elite power? Lucius Appuleius Saturninus and Gaius Servilius Glaucia tried to reintroduce the Gracchi legislation but their acts were also shut down and they were lynched. The clear difference in rights between the Romans and the allies were brought to the forefront of social and political debate after the Cimbrian War where Italian allies contributed significantly to the Roman victory. In the aftermath, Gaius Marius granted citizenship to those Italian soldiers leading to a surge of new questions regarding national identity. Plutarch provides an account of Marius's leadership in the Cimbrian Wars and his attitude towards the Italians: > “And yet we are told that when he had bestowed citizenship upon as many as a > thousand men of Camerinum for conspicuous bravery in the war, the act was > held to be illegal and was impeached by some; to whom he replied that the > clash of arms had prevented his hearing the voice of the law. However, he > appeared to be in greater fear and terror of the shouting in the popular > assemblies. At any rate, while in war he had authority and power because his > services were needed, yet in civil life his leadership was more abridged, > and he therefore had recourse to the goodwill and favour of the multitude, > not caring to be the best man if only he could be the greatest. The > consequence was that he came into collision with all the > aristocrats.”Plutarch, Parallel Lives, 28.2-4 This is yet another instance in which the rising debates surrounding the rights of the Italians to Roman citizenship had come to cause dissent amongst aristocrats who disregarded a successful general's attempt to represent the rights of his soldiers. There were legal also precedents for the creation of the Lex Licinia Mucia. One such example was the Lex Cornelia of Sulla which took Roman rights from Italian communities. The Lex Claudia of 177 BC similarly took Roman rights from Latin groups by declaring that anyone who was, or his parents were, citizens of an allied community in the censorship of M. Claudius and T. Quinctius must return to that community before the first of November: > \\"Then C. Claudius, with the authorization of the senate, proposed a law > concerning the allies and decreed that all allies [and members] of the Latin > name, who themselves or whose ancestors had been registered among the allies > (and) Latin name in the censorship of M. Claudius and T. Quinctius or > thereafter should all return, each to his own state, before the Kalends of > November. The investigation of those who should not have returned was > decreed to L. Mummius the praetor.\\"Livy. The History of Rome, 41.9.9-11 Cicero in his De Oratore, however, references a particular event which possibly caused the direct creation of the law: > “Often a verse is thrown in humorously, either as it is or slightly changed, > or part of a verse, as a verse of Statius was by Scaurus when he was angry; > from which some say that your law about the citizenship, Crassus, was born: > ‘Shh! Quiet! What is this row? You who have neither mother nor father, such > assurance? Be off with that pride of yours.” Here, Cicero is saying that there are some who believe that the consul Lucius Licinius Crassus was inspired by Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC) who quotes Statius. The cause of Scaurus's angry quotation was possibly the trial of Gaius Norbanus (a newly made Roman citizen) when a crowd of non-citizen allies had gathered at Rome to watch his trial, at which point Scaurus snapped at the crowd to quiet down using Statius's oration. Tweedie argues that the mere annoyance of these allies would not have been enough to inspire the creation of the Lex Licinia Mucia. Additionally, the law would not provide an immediate remedy to the problem of the rowdy ally crowd, as the law was not one of expulsion but one of investigation. This mention of the creation of the Lex Licinia Mucia by Cicero demonstrates that the law was really directed at a specific group of non-citizens who disrupted an aristocrat's public speech, something which Scaurus felt to be an intrusion on his rights as an elite Roman citizen. Another example of the growing tensions between elite Romans and non-Romans. Nevertheless, this passage is cited as a possible event in which the creation of the law was inspired.  Crassus and Scaevola  The Lex Licinia Mucia was enacted in the year 95 BC. The Consuls for the year 95 were Lucius Licinius Crassus and Quintus Mucius Scaevola and it was they who gave their names to the Lex Licinia Mucia. These two had served as colleagues throughout the various offices in their progression in the Cursus honorum, culminating in their Consulship.Cicero. Brutus. 161 L. Licinius Crassus was by the time of his Consulship already renowned as an orator. During the course of his rise through Roman public life he had used his oratory skills to speak in support of conservative causes. When the Consul Quintus Servilius Caepio sought to legislate to allow members of the Senate to serve on juries, thereby ending the monopoly of the equestrian class, Crassus made a speech so fiery in support of the Lex Servilla that it was considered an exemplar of Roman oratory.Cicero. De Oratore. 1.255 Cicero himself highly regarded and studied it.Cicero. Brutus. 164 Subsequent to his term as consul, Crassus was elected as Censor. In this capacity he made a strong stand against Latin rhetors, teachers of rhetoric. This has been seen as a further bias against the Roman allies. The rhetors were possible sources of Latin agitation within Rome itself and earned Crassus’ ire for providing what he considered training inadequate for the future leaders of Rome. Before his death in 91 BC Crassus had modified his position on Roman citizenship in so far at least that he appeared to concede its practical necessity, provided a proper legal framework was in place. The second man responsible for the Lex Licinia Mucia, Quintus Mucius Scaevola, became, in the years following the Consulship of 95, the governor of the Roman Asia province. He then was elected to the prestigious office of Pontifix Maximus only to die in the civil unrest of 82 BC.  Operation of the law  The Lex Licinia Mucia was not a law of expulsion or execution. Cicero outlines that the law did not require permanent evacuation from the city of Rome, rather, it banned non-citizens from acting as Roman citizens:Cicero. De Oficiis. 3.47 > “They, too, do wrong who prevent foreigners from the enjoyment of a city and > expel them, as Pennus did in the time of our fathers and Papius more > recently. For it is right not to allow one who is not a citizen to conduct > himself as a citizen; the very wise Crassus and Scaevola passed such a law. > To ban foreigners from a city, however, is contrary to humanity.” The law likely required that allies had to re-register themselves into their allied community unless they could provide evidence of his Roman citizenship. Those who did not re-register were liable for investigation by the censors. Cicero's Pro Balbo provides the only example of a prosecution under the Lex Licinia Mucia: > “For T. Matrinius of Spoletium, one of those to whom C. Marius had given > citizenship, was prosecuted, being from a Latin colony among the first for > reliability and reputation.”Cicero. Pro Balbo. 48-9 In this case, Matrinius of Spoletium was being used by Cicero as anecdotal evidence to defend Pompey's grant of citizenship to Lucius Cornelius Balbus, just as Marius gave citizenship to Matrinius. Cicero tells us that L. Antistius had prosecuted the defendant for having been given citizenship under the Lex Appuleia of Saturninus which only granted the privilege of Roman citizenship to three members of each conquered colony. According to Antistius the colonies had not actually been founded, thus Matrinius should not receive citizenship. Matrinius’ prosecution under the Lex Licinia Mucia would likely have been brought about due to his refusal to re-submit his name to the citizen rolls of Spoletium, thus bringing himself to the attention of Antistius who could question what criteria Matrinius possessed that was allowing him to identify as a Roman citizen. The censors thus investigated the case and he was brought before the law courts to be prosecuted. In this trial, Cicero has employed his characteristic oratorical tact by mentioning the law as a means of destabilising Crassus and Scaevola's relationship with Marius, whom they were friends with, by using their law against him. Thus, whilst the law operated in practical terms of legal prosecution, it was also used as a rhetorical device, particularly by Cicero, to criticise the scrutiny of citizenship. These censorial investigations at the time of the Lex Licinia Mucia were widely hated and caused agitation amongst allies. Diodorus Siculus provides an anecdote of such irritation: > “The Marsic leader Pompaedius embarked on a grandiose and fantastic venture. > assembling ten thousand men drawn from the ranks of those who had occasion > to fear judicial investigations, he led them to Rome, with swords concealed > beneath their garb of peace. It was his intention to surround the senate > with armed men and demand the citizenship or, if persuasion failed, to > ravage the seat of empire with fire and sword.”Diodorus Siculus. 37.13. This fear of judicial investigations created an air of paranoia as the censors checked to make sure that the correct names were on the Roman citizen rolls after the introduction of the Lex Licinia Mucia; making certain that no one has re-enrolled who was not born in Rome. The operation of the law caused increased tensions amongst the socii who “were gripped by a great desire for the Roman citizenship”Asconius. 67-8 especially after their collaborative role in the Cimbric War. In past cases relating to citizenship, the common punishment for false identity had been flogging, as attested by PlinyPliny. NH. 7.136 and Livy.Livy. Per. 55 The humiliation that flogging imposed upon the victim, especially one forced to leave Rome, suggests that this act was a possible punishment for those transgressing the Lex Licinia Mucia.  Aftermath  The law is quoted by Asconius as being a central cause of the Social War (91–88 BC) that occurred in the years after its introduction. \\"The feelings of the leaders of the Italic peoples were so alienated by this law that it was even the main reason for the bellum Italicum that broke out three years later.\\"Asconius. 67-8C The agitation of the Italians was briefly suspended in 91 BC when the tribune, Marcus Livius Drusus, introduced new laws that granted citizenship to the Italian allies who subsequently swore an oath of allegiance to him; the oath is recorded by Diodorus Siculus.Diodorus Siculus. 37.11 However, his subsequent failure to follow through on his promises led to his assassination by his frustrated Italian followers. This murder was born from the long history of tensions between Romans and allies and was the cause of the first Italian revolt that led to the Bellum Italicum. The Lex Licinia Mucia, according to Asconius, was instrumental in accelerating their dissatisfaction.

Held is a German music producer and musician, known for his work in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. He was involved with several artists of the krautrock, disco, and new wave era, such as Birth Control, Rockets, Gina X Performance, Dead Or Alive, John Foxx, Fashion, and Men Without Hats on their successful album Pop Goes the World.Barclay, Michael; Jack, Ian & Schneider, Jason (2011) Have Not Been the Same, ECW Press, Besides being an experienced producer and sound creator, his musical education on piano and reed instruments made him also a well-respected arranger. Spending 6 years as keyboard player and multi-instrumentalist with the German prog-rock group \\"Birth Control\\" (6 LPs) gave him experience as a touring musician. After these years on the road he worked as producer, session musician, programmer, and engineer in German and French studios before moving to London in 1982. Career His production “……combines electronic Teutonic sounds with a soulful sensibility for melodic expression…”. (NME, June 1982) After writing and producing the groundbreaking album by Gina X Performance Nice Mover, (followed by three more Gina X albums), his first UK production credits were with Fashion and Dead or Alive,\\"Top Single Picks\\", Billboard, 21 August 1982, p. 67\\\\. Retrieved 20 August 2014Chin, Brian (1985) \\"DanceTrax\\", Billboard, 23 March 1985, p. 57. Retrieved 20 August 2014 he produced Pete Wylie's Sinful album and an album by Men Without Hats for Polygram US which yielded a number one in many European countries and a US Top 20 hit with \\"Pop Goes The World\\". This was followed by two albums with Transvision Vamp on MCA with a top five single and a number one album. Zeus went on to write and produce two successful albums with Nina Hagen (Nina Hagen in 1990,Hardy, Phil (1995) The Da Capo Companion to 20th-century Popular Music, Da Capo Press, , p. 111 and Street in 1991), Udo Lindenberg's Casanova, Win, National Velvet, Spear of Destiny, and two albums with Marc Parrot. He has produced and co-written an album with South African group Shikisha, an EP with Victoria Wilson-James, and recorded and produced an album with Hawkwind – Distant Horizons. In 1995 he wrote and recorded the music for a worldwide advertising campaign for Swatch. His 1987 'E Reg' remix of Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\" hit the British charts again as the 'Premier Mix' in March '96. After extended travelling round the world he produced his own two projects: No Sweat, a jazzy hip hop album with diverse guest singers and assorted samples and involving his collected samples \\"Inma Wiru\\", his Australian project under the banner of \\"Digital Dreaming\\", distributed by Warner Music. During his long stays in Australia Zeus also toured and recorded with Aboriginal Singer and Guitarist Frank Yamma and his band. In 1999 he co-wrote Nina Hagen's single \\"Der Poetenclub\\" which also features the voice of Falco (of \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\" fame). His production and arranging skills led to intensive work on audio-visuals and soundtracks, one of which was a British film shown at the Cannes 2001 festival, Mad Dogs. Since 2003 he has divided his time between working in his Freiburg, Germany-based studio and his London KGBeat studio and production setup. From 2005 Zeus he also worked with \\"Jazz & Rock Schulen Freiburg\\", where he created and realised the 3-year project \\"EuroPop\\", which was a musician's networking, events (EuroPop Festival in Neuf-Brisach) and education program founded by the European Union. His musical ventures saw Zeus writing for and playing with big bands and orchestras. The 2011 retrospective album, Voice-Versa, featuring solo material as well as tracks by Gina X Performance and Rockets is a compilation of vocoder and electronic music. The release of his remixed and remastered Australian album Dream2Machine on the Broome-based label Desert Ocean Productions in late 2013 also marks Zeus' continual creative collaboration with Jim Lampi and his multimedia approach to music and the arts. His latest solo adventure Logic of Coincidence, released June 2015 on Les Disques du Crepuscule, is an album of electronic music which features US cult author Luke Rhinehart's voice and readings on two tracks. A remix of one album track by \\"Dream Control\\" marks the start of Zeus' collaboration with former Tangerine Dream member Steve Schroyder. In August 2017 Dream Control's first album entitled \\"Zeitgeber\\" is released on Planetware Records. In October a special edited vinyl version of this album was released on U.S. label Medical Records. Currently Dream Control is working on a film project which should be released in early 2019.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sarcosine:acceptor oxidoreductase (demethylating). Other names in common use include sarcosine N-demethylase, monomethylglycine dehydrogenase, and sarcosine:(acceptor) oxidoreductase (demethylating). Sarcosine dehydrogenase is closely related to dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the demethylation reaction of dimethylglycine to sarcosine. Both sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase use FAD as a cofactor. Sarcosine dehydrogenase is linked by electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) to the respiratory redox chain. The general chemical reaction catalyzed by sarcosine dehydrogenase is: :sarcosine + acceptor + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons glycine + formaldehyde + reduced acceptor  Structure  There is no crystal structure available for sarcosine dehydrogenase. Sarcosine dehydrogenase contains a covalently bound FAD group \\" linked via the 8 alpha position of the isoalloxazine ring to an imidazole N(3) of a histidine residue\\". The enzyme, according to Freisell Wr. et al., also contains non-heme iron in a ratio of 1 or 2 iron per 300000g of enzyme, and 0.5 mol of acid soluble sulfur suggesting that the electron transfer during the first step in the reaction might proceed through a different pathway than that of Fe-S clusters.  Mechanism  Figure 1: First step in sarcosine dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction mechanism Figure 2: Sarcosine going to glycine reaction mechanism without THF present. Figure 3: Sarcosine going to glycine reaction mechanism with tetrahydrofolate (THF) present. Sarcosine dehydrogenase, with sarcosine as its substrate, follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics and has a Km of 0.5 mM and a Vmax of 16 mmol/hr/mg protein. The enzyme is inhibited competitively by methoxyacetic acid, which has a Ki of 0.26 mM The exact mechanism of sarcosine dehydrogenase is not available. However, according to the overall net reaction discussed in Honova.E, et al. paper: * Sarcosine + H2O + O2 → glycine + formaldehyde + H2O2 the first step of the reaction might involve the transfer of a hydride on the N-methyl group of sarcosine onto FAD, allowing H2O to attack the carbocation in order to form intermediate 1 (See figure 1). There is no deamination step. Instead, the demethylation of the N-methyl group on sarcosine occurs directly. The reduced FADH− from the first step then is oxidized by O2 to form H2O2. The demethylation of sarcosine catalyzed by sarcosine dehydrogenase can proceed with or without the presence of tetrahydrofolate. Under anaerobic condition and without tetrahydrofolate, however, a free formaldehyde is formed after the N-demethylation of sarcosine. The reaction with 1 mole of sarcosine and 1 mole of FAD, under this condition, yields 1 mole of glycine and 1 mole of formaldehyde (See figure 2 for mechanism). Under the presence of tetrahydrofolate, sarcosine dehydrogenase binds to tetrahydrofolate and convert tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate here serves as a 1-carbon acceptor during the demethylation process (See figure 3 for mechanism).  Function  Sarcosine dehydrogenase is one of the enzymes in sarcosine metabolism, which catalyzes the demethylation of sarcosine to make glycine. It is preceded by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase which turns dimethylglycine into sarcosine. Glycine can also be turned into sarcosine by glycine N-methyltransferase. Since glycine is the production of sarcosine dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction, aside from sarcosine metabolism, the enzyme is also indirectly connected to the creatine cycle and the respiratory chain in the mitochondria (See figure 4 for pathway). Even so, the biological significance of sarcosine dehydrogenase beyond sarcosine metabolism is not entirely known. In a study of hereditary hemochromatosis using both wild type and HFE (gene) deficient mice fed with 2 percent carbonyl iron supplemented diet, sarcosine dehydrogenase was shown to be down-regulated in HFE deficient mice, but role sarcosine dehydrogenase in iron metabolism is unknown from the experiment conducted. Figure 4: Sarcosine metabolism and related pathway.  Disease relevance  = Sarcosinemia = Sarcosinemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation of the sarcosine dehydrogenase gene in the 9q33-q34 gene locus. This leads to a compromised sarcosine metabolism and causes the build-up of sarcosine in blood and urine, a condition known as sarcosinemia. = Prostate cancer = In addition to sarcosinaemia, sarcosine dehydrogenase also seems to play a role in the progression process of prostate cancer. The concentration of sarcosine, along with those of uracil, kynurenine, glycerol 3-phosphate, leucine and proline increases as prostate cancer progresses. Thus, sarcosine can be used as a potential biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer and for measuring the progress of the disease. As Sreekumar, A. et al.’s paper shows, the removal of sarcosine dehydrogenase from benign prostate epithelial cells increases the concentration of sarcosine and increase cancer cell invasions while the removal of either dimethylglycine dehydrogenase or glycine N-methyltransferase in prostate cancer cells decreases cell invasions. This demonstrates that sarcosine metabolism plays a key-role in prostate cancer cell invasion and migration. Sreekumar’s study suggests that sarcosine dehydrogenase and other enzymes in the sarcosine metabolism pathways could be potential therapeutic targets for prostate cancer. However, a study done by Jentzmik F. et al. by analyzing sarcosine level in 92 patients with prostate cancer draws a different conclusion: sarcosine cannot be used as an indicator and biomarker for prostate cancer.

T. Barnum and his freak show exhibitions.  Life  Waino and Plutanor were actually Hiram W. and Barney Davis, two mentally disabled brothers from Pleasant Township, Knox County, Ohio farm, born in 1825 in England, p. 121 and 1827 in Ohio respectively. The 1850 census for them suggests they were born slightly later in 1829 and 1831. Their parents were David Harrison Davis and Catherine Blydenburgh. After their father's death in 1842, their mother remarried to William Porter. They were each 40 inches tall (100cm) and weighed about 45 pounds (20kg), yet could perform feats of great strength such as lifting heavy weights and wrestling with audience members on stage. Discovered and subsequently promoted by a traveling showman known as Doctor Warner in 1852, Hiram and Barney were given new names, Waino and Plutanor, and a sensational back story – they were said to be from the island of Borneo, where they had been captured after a great struggle with armed sailors. They initially had modest success, but at least one newspaper believed them to be dwarves from the United States. The two soon went on to be exhibited at state fairs across the United States. At the time of the 1860 census they were living in Somerville, Massachusetts in the household of Henry Harvey, a showman. At some point in the next few years management of the pair was transferred to a relative of Doctor Warner, Hanford A. Warner. In 1874 they were valued at $50,000. In January 1877 they were performing at the New American Museum located in Manhattan. In June 1880 at the time of the federal census, they were touring with William C. Coup's circus and were enumerated under their assumed identities. By 1882 Waino and Plutanor became involved with P. T. Barnum and his traveling exhibitions. With Barnum's fabled promotional skill, the careers of the Wild Men of Borneo took off and over the course of the next 25 years, the pair earned approximately $200,000, which was an enormous sum in that era, equivalent to $6,000,000 today. Their exhibitions primarily consisted of performing acts of great strength, such as lifting adult audience members and wrestling with both audience members and each other. They were said to be able to lift up to each. In November 1887 they were performing at Eugene Robinson's Dime Museum and Theatre. In the 1890s Hanford's son Ernest took over the management duties of the Davis brothers due to the elder Hanford becoming blind. In 1903 the brothers were withdrawn from exhibitions by the Warner family. Hiram died in Waltham, Massachusetts on March 16, 1905. Barney stopped working after his brother's death. Their former manager Hanford Warner died in 1910. Barney died on May 31, 1912 at Waltham, Massachusetts at the Warner family home. The two are buried together in Mount Vernon, Ohio, under a gravestone marked \\"Little Men.\\" Newspapers from the time report them being buried in Waltham, Massachusetts. It is unknown when their bodies were moved to Ohio. References External links * Wild men of Borneo at The Human Marvels * James G.

He was the son of John K. and Cecilia Glazebrook of Twemlow Hall, Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, and was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford. He was a partner in the firm of Spurrier and Glazebrook Limited, oil merchants, Manchester. He held the rank of captain in the Cheshire Yeomanry. He was unmarried. In December 1910 he was chosen as Conservative candidate to contest the constituency of Manchester South at the general election. However, due to an error by his election agent, he arrived at Manchester Town Hall six minutes after nominations had closed, resulting in the unopposed election of the sitting Liberal MP, Arthur Haworth. In February 1912 Haworth was appointed as a Junior Lord of the Treasury, requiring him to seek re-election in a by-election. Glazebrook was the Conservative candidate, and a vigorous campaign was held, with the main issues being woman suffrage, Home Rule and National Insurance. Glazebrook managed to unseat Haworth, winning the seat by 579 votes. With the outbreak of war in 1914, the Cheshire Yeomanry were mobilised, and Glazebrook served in Egypt and Palestine. He advanced to the rank of major, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in February 1918. The citation read: > For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When, by the capture of a > neighbouring height, the enemy had rendered the position of two companies > most precarious because they now came under concentrated machine-gun fire > from their left rear, he immediately went to the most threatened spot, and > by his courageous bearing and great coolness was responsible for the safe > withdrawal of these companies. The unfailing energy and resolution shown by > this officer were most noticeable. Glazebrook from the Roll of Honour published in The Illustrated London News on 20 April 1918 In March 1917 the Cheshire Yeomanry were merged with the Shropshire Yeomanry to form an infantry unit: the 10th (Shropshire and Cheshire Yeomanry) Battalion, The King's (Shropshire Light Infantry). Major Glazebrook was killed in action on 7 March 1918 at Bireh, near Jerusalem and is buried in the Jerusalem British War Cemetery. Glazebrook is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. Glazebrook is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of Glazebrook.

This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis.  Function  Shikimate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes one step of the shikimate pathway. This pathway is found in bacteria, plants, fungi, algae, and parasites and is responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) from the metabolism of carbohydrates. In contrast, animals and humans lack this pathway hence products of this biosynthetic route are essential amino acids that must be obtained through an animal's diet. There are seven enzymes that play a role in this pathway. Shikimate dehydrogenase (also known as 3-dehydroshikimate dehydrogenase) is the fourth step of the seven step process. This step converts 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate as well as reduces NADP+ to NADPH.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is shikimate:NADP+ 3-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include: * dehydroshikimic reductase, * shikimate oxidoreductase, * shikimate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, * 5-dehydroshikimate reductase, * shikimate 5-dehydrogenase, * 5-dehydroshikimic reductase, * DHS reductase, * shikimate:NADP+ 5-oxidoreductase, and * AroE.  Reaction  The Shikimate Dehydrogenase Reaction Shikimate Dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible NADPH-dependent reaction of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate. The enzyme reduces the carbon-oxygen double bond of a carbonyl functional group to a hydroxyl (OH) group, producing the shikimate anion. The reaction is NADPH dependent with NADPH being oxidised to NADP+.  Structure  =N terminal domain= The Shikimate dehydrogenase substrate binding domain found at the N-terminus binds to the substrate, 3-dehydroshikimate. It is considered to be the catalytic domain. It has a structure of six beta strands forming a twisted beta sheet with four alpha helices. =C terminal domain= The C-terminal domain binds to NADPH. It has a special structure, a Rossmann fold, whereby six-stranded twisted and parallel beta sheet with loops and alpha helices surrounding the core beta sheet. The Structure of Shikimate dehydrogenase is characterized by two domains, two alpha helices and two beta sheets with a large cleft separating the domains of the monomer. The enzyme is symmetrical. Shikimate dehydrogenase also has an NADPH binding site that contains a Rossmann fold. This binding site normally contains a glycine P-loop. The domains of the monomer show a fair amount of flexibility suggesting that the enzyme can open in close to bind with the substrate 3-Dehydroshikimate. Hydrophobic interactions occur between the domains and the NADPH binding site. This hydrophobic core and its interactions lock the shape of the enzyme even though the enzyme is a dynamic structure. There is also evidence to support that the structure of the enzyme is conserved, meaning the structure takes sharp turns in order to take up less space. The cleft in the shikimate dehydrogenase monomer. The green selection is the loops surrounding the cleft, and the red selection shows alpha helices in the background.  Paralogs  Escherichia coli (E. coli) expresses two different forms of shikimate dehydrogenase, AroE and YdiB. These two forms are paralogs of each other. The two forms of shikimate dehydrogenase have different primary sequences in different organisms but catalyze the same reactions. There is about 25% similarity between the sequences of AroE and YdiB, but their two structures have similar structures with similar folds. YdiB can utilize NAD or NADP as a cofactor and also reacts with quinic acid. They both have high affinity of their ligands as shown by their similar enzyme (Km) values. Both forms of the enzyme are independently regulated. Shikimate dehydrogenase YdiB with highlighted NADH binding sites. The red color of the surface of the structure shows alpha helices, the yellow shows beta sheets, and the green area shows where there are loops in the enzyme. The AroE form of shikimate dehydrogenase with highlighted NADP+ binding sites. The red color shows where the alpha helices are, the green shows the loops, and the yellow shows the beta sheets in the structure.  Applications  The shikimate pathway is a target for herbicides and other non-toxic drugs because the shikimate pathway is not present in humans. Glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, is an inhibitor of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase or EPSP synthase, an enzyme in the shikimate pathway. The problem is that this herbicide has been utilized for about 20 years and now some plants have now emerged that are glyphosate-resistant. This has relevance to research on shikimate dehydrogenase because it is important to maintain diversity in the enzyme blocking process in the shikimate pathway and with more research shikimate dehydrogenase could be the next enzyme to be inhibited in the shikimate pathway. In order to design new inhibitors the structures for all the enzymes in the pathway have needed to be elucidated. The presence of two forms of the enzyme complicate the design of potential drugs because one could compensate for the inhibition of the other. Also there the TIGR data base shows that there are 14 species of bacteria with the two forms of shikimate dehydrogenase. This is a problem for drug makers because there are two enzymes that a potential drug would need to inhibit at the same time.

The ball came to be over 25 years ago, as an offshoot of a dance portion of the Great Dickens Christmas Fair held in San Francisco. The event was held at Oakland's Scottish Rite Center on the shore of Lake Merritt every two months through the end of 2014. Due to the increased costs of the hall, the event has become less frequent; only one ball was held in 2015, in October. Music for the event is provided by \\"Brassworks\\", a popular local band. The evening includes a basic vintage waltz lesson for early attendees and some small potluck refreshments. Dances are taught during a brief course before the ball begins, and include vintage waltz, schottische, polka, mazurka, and several English country dances. Occasionally, groups will form on the sidelines to dance alternate arrangements to the English Country songs; previous examples include Irish four-hand reels, the Scottish country dance \\"Petronella\\", the Virginia reel, and various Contra dances. Full Victorian dress is not required; the dress code is formal wear of the nineteenth or twentieth centuries. A minimum of semi-formal attire is requested by the ball staff. Although seldom exercised, the staff reserves the right to refuse entrance to those who are inappropriately attired. There are occasional performances by local dance troupes during the intermission, however there is no official dance group affiliated with the ball. The Gaskell Ball is a favorite among dancers from the Stanford, UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz social dance circles, and is widely credited for popularizing John Hertz's Congress of Vienna Waltz and Richard Powers' Bohemian National Polka choreographies. History The Gaskell Ball is named for the British writer Elizabeth Gaskell. The Gaskell Ball originated in 1979, when the troupe playing the Gaskell family at the Charles Dickens Fair decided to hold a ball in her honor. The first ball was held at Mills College, a women's college in Oakland. In proceeding years it was held at the Veterans' Auditorium in Oakland. In the 1990s the ball outgrew the hall and was moved to accommodate the increased attendance.

The area, built as part of Disney California Adventure Park's $1.1 billion expansion project, opened on June 15, 2012. It contains three rides as well as shops and restaurants, all situated in a replica of Radiator Springs, the fictional town in which most of the first film's events take place. The area's main attraction is Radiator Springs Racers, a racing ride that uses the technology of Epcot's Test Track. History Most of the present-day site of Cars Land had been used as the \\"Timon\\" parking lot since 2001; the lot had been designated as future growth space for Disney California Adventure when it was originally designed in the 1990s, and was partially built over with The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and the Flik's Fun Fair section of A Bug's Land. A small portion of Cars Land was built over the site of the Bountiful Valley Farm, one of the park's original attractions. As revealed in The Imagineering Story, initially the park was going to be called \\"Carland\\" and would be themed after the automobile in general. It was not until after Cars was seen as a viable franchise that it was rethemed and renamed \\"Cars Land\\". Concept art for \\"Carland\\" appeared in the \\"Dreaming\\" section of the Walt Disney Company's 2006 Annual Report, released on December 12, 2006, six months after Cars was released in theaters. The concept art depicted a racing simulator ride, but provided no specifics; Disney CEO Bob Iger stated at the time that the concept art depicted projects at various stages of development, and that some of the projects depicted \\"may never be built.\\" On October 17, 2007, Disney announced a 5-year, $1.1 billion renovation and expansion plan for Disney California Adventure. The plan included a major overhaul of several existing areas of the park and the addition of Cars Land, an area themed to the 2006 film; Cars Land would be anchored by Radiator Springs Racers, a Cars version of Test Track, a ride at Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort. Cars Land along with the re- designed entrance plaza, Buena Vista Street, were the last features of the 5-year project to be completed, and opened on June 15, 2012. Attractions =Radiator Springs Racers= Radiator Springs Racers – a slot car dark ride. The attraction takes guests in six-person vehicles through the winding roads up the mountains outside Radiator Springs and by the waterfall scene in the first film. The cars then enter the mountain and take a semi-wild ride through the outskirts of town where they encounter a number of characters. Eventually, they enter Radiator Springs at which point the track splits into two: one goes into Ramone's while the other into Luigi's. From here, the cars enter a briefing room where Doc gives guests some advice for the upcoming race. The two tracks come back near one another and two cars stop side-by-side. The race begins as the vehicles accelerate out of the mountain and through hairpin turns and steep banks, ending with a randomized race result and then a brief trip through Tail Light Caverns. The technology used is similar to Test Track at Epcot in Walt Disney World in Florida, and Journey to the Center of the Earth at Tokyo DisneySea. =Mater's Junkyard Jamboree= Mater's Junkyard Jamboree (renamed Mater's Graveyard JamBOOree during Halloween and Mater's Jingle Jamboree during Christmas) – an attraction in the style of a whip ride themed to Mater's Junkyard. Mater is the Master of Ceremonies of the Jamboree. The vehicles are baby tractors which pull trailers attached to them that move around with the music. Similar attractions to Mater's Junkyard Jamboree have been built since the ride opened with Cars Land in 2012. The most recent example is Alien Swirling Saucers, a whip ride which opened in Disney's Hollywood Studios version of \\"Toy Story Land\\" in 2018. =Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters= Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters (renamed Luigi's Honkin' Haul-O-Ween during Halloween and Luigi's Joy to the Whirl during Christmas) – Guests queue in Luigi's Casa Della Tires shop and ride in vehicles that move and spin around to Italian music. The attraction uses a trackless ride system, similar to Aquatopia at Tokyo DisneySea. The ride vehicles are depicted as being Luigi's cousins who have come to Radiator Springs for a dance celebration. The attraction, which officially opened March 7, 2016, replaced Luigi's Flying Tires, the original attraction in this location. Former attractions * Luigi's Flying Tires Restaurants Flo's V8 Cafe at night =Cozy Cone Motel= The Cozy Cone Motel features five different cones, each with a different menu of food and drinks, including churros, ice cream, snacks, pretzels, and popcorn. The motel office in front is not accessible to guests, although the interior is decorated as it was in the films. Additionally, the front and side entrances of the motel is a common space for character meet and greets, with guests being able to meet Lightning McQueen, Mater, and, most recently, Cruz Ramirez. =Flo's V8 Cafe= Flo's V8 Cafe serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert with traditional American homestyle fare. Part of the indoor dining room is located inside of Doc Hudson's Ornament Valley Medical Clinic, while guests can also dine outdoors underneath the gas pumps and at tables behind the restaurant.

There are references to the events of Cars 2 throughout the land, such as a billboard (seen when entering from A Bug's Land) that gives Mater the title of \\"Sir,\\" and a signed photo of Finn McMissile with Luigi and Guido in Luigi's Casa Della Tires, in addition to souvenirs from their World Grand Prix trip in a display case. The main street is Route 66 coming in from the Golden State area, across from the Golden Vine Winery and Walt Disney Imagineering Blue Sky Cellar. There is one other entrance is a street from Ornament Valley from Pacific Wharf which is called Cross Street. At the end of Route 66 is the courthouse/firehouse where the street splits. To the left of the split is a backstage access gate. To the right of the split is the entrance to Radiator Springs Racers. In the distance, the Radiator Cap and Ornament Valley Range can be seen.

John Preston, 1629 engraving Upbringing John Preston, the son of Thomas Preston, a farmer, and his wife Alice, daughter of Lawrence Marsh of Northampton, was born at Upper Heyford in the parish of Bugbrook, Northamptonshire. He was baptised at Bugbrook church on 27 October 1587. His father died when he was 13 years old, and his mother's maternal uncle, Creswell, who was mayor of Northampton and rich and childless, adopted Preston, placing him at the Northampton Grammar School, and subsequently with a Bedfordshire clergyman named Guest for instruction in Greek. He matriculated as a sizar at King's College, Cambridge, on 5 July 1604, his tutor being Busse, who became master of Eton in 1606. King's College was then famous for the study of music; Preston chose 'the noblest but hardest instrument, the lute', but made little progress. In 1606 he migrated to Queens' College, where he had as tutor Oliver Bowles, B.D. Creswell had left him the reversion of some landed property, and he thought of a diplomatic career. With this view he entered into treaty with a merchant, who arranged for his spending some time in Paris, but on this merchant's death the arrangement fell through. Preston then turned to the study of philosophy, in which he was encouraged by Porter, who succeeded Bowles as his tutor. By Porter's interest with Humphrey Tyndall, master of Queens' and dean of Ely, Preston, who had graduated B.A. in 1607, was chosen fellow in 1609. From philosophy he now turned to medicine; got some practical knowledge under the roof of a friend, a physician in Kent, 'very famous for his practice'; and studied astrology, then valued as a handmaid to therapeutics. Career as a preacher About 1611, the year in which he commenced MA, he heard a sermon at St Mary's from John Cotton, then fellow of Emmanuel, which opened to him a new career. Cotton had a great reputation as an elegant preacher; but this was a plain evangelical sermon, and disappointed his audience. He returned to his rooms, somewhat mortified by his reception, when Preston knocked at his door, and that close religious friendship began which permanently influenced the lives of both. Preston now gave himself to the study of scholastic divinity; Aquinas seems to have been his favourite ; he thoroughly mastered also Duns Scotus and William of Ockham. His biographer tells a curious story of his activity in securing the election (1614) of John Davenant as master of Queens' in succession to Tyndal. George Montaigne, afterwards Archbishop of York, had his eye on this preferment; but immediately on Tyndal's death Preston rode post-haste to London, reaching Whitehall before day-break. Here he made interest with Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, with a view to secure court sanction for the choice of Davenant. Returning to Cambridge, he had the election over before Montaigne got wind of the vacancy. During the visit of James I to Cambridge in March 1615, Preston distinguished himself as a disputant. He was chosen by Samuel Harsnett, the vice-chancellor, as 'answerer' in the philosophy act, but this place was successfully claimed by Matthew Wren, and Preston took the post of first opponent. His biographer, Thomas Ball, gives an account of the disputation on the question 'Whether dogs could make syllogismes'. Preston maintained that they could. James was delighted with his argument (which Granger thinks Preston borrowed from a well-known passage in Montaigne's Essays), and introduced a dog story of his own. 'It was easy to discerne that ye kings hound had opened a way for Mr. Preston at ye court'. Sir Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, became his firm friend (he ultimately settled £50 a year upon him). But Preston had by this time given up his early ambition; though he said little of his purpose, his mind was set on the ministry, and he was reading modern divinity, especially Calvin. Puritan leanings His coolness in the direction of court favour gave rise to suspicions of his puritan leaning. These were increased by an incident of James's second visit to Cambridge. A comedy called Ignoramus, by George Ruggle of Clare Hall, was to be acted before the king. Preston's pupil Morgan (of the Morgans of Heyford) was cast for a woman's part. Preston objected; the lad's guardians over-ruled the objection; Morgan, who was removed to Oxford, subsequently joined the Roman Catholic Church. His strictness greatly increased his reputation as a tutor with puritan parents; 'he was,' says Fuller, 'the greatest pulpit-monger in England in man's memory. ... every time, when Master Preston plucked off his hat to Doctor Davenant, the college master, he gained a chamber or study for one of his pupils'. The college buildings were enlarged to provide for the influx of students. He was in the habit of sending those designed for the church to finish their studies with Cotton, now vicar of Boston, Lincolnshire. Meanwhile, Preston's health was suffering, and he was troubled with insomnia. Twice he applied for advice (once in disguise) to William Butler of Clare Hall, a successful empiric. Butler only told him to take tobacco; on doing so he found his remedy in 'this hot copious fume.' Holy orders Lancelot Andrewes directed Preston to declare his judgment regarding forms of prayer in a sermon at St Botolph's. Preston had now taken orders, and become dean and catechist of Queens'. He began a course of sermons which were to form a body of divinity. Complaints were made to the vice-chancellor that the college chapel was crowded with scholars from other colleges and townsmen. Order was issued excluding all but members of the college. Preston then began an afternoon lecture at St. Botolph's, of which Queens' College is patron. This brought him into conflict with Newcome, commissary to the chancellor of Ely, whose enmity Preston had earned by preventing a match between his pupil, Sir Capel Bedels, and Newcome's daughter Jane. A dispute with Newcome at St. Botolph's delayed the afternoon service; to make room for the sermon, common prayer was for once omitted. Newcome sped to the court at Newmarket to denounce Preston as a nonconformist. The matter came before the heads of houses, and there was talk of Preston's expulsion from the university. At the suggestion of Lancelot Andrewes, then Bishop of Ely, Preston was directed to declare his judgment regarding forms of prayer in a sermon at St. Botolph's. He acquitted himself so as to silence complaint. Soon afterwards he was summoned to preach before the king at Finchingbrook, near Royston, Cambridgeshire. James highly approved his argument against the Arminians; he would have shown him less favour had he known that Preston was the author of a paper against the Spanish match, circulated with much secrecy among members of the House of Lords. He was proposed as a royal chaplain by James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn, but James thought this premature. Chaplain-in-ordinary The Duke of Buckingham was a relation. Preston's kinsman, Sir Ralph Freeman, who had married a relative of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, now took occasion to represent to Buckingham that he might make friends of the puritans by promoting Preston. Through Buckingham's interest he was made chaplain-in- ordinary to Prince Charles. He took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1620. On Davenant's election (11 June 1621) to the see of Salisbury, Preston had some expectation of succeeding him as Margaret professor of divinity. He felt his Latin to be rusty, and, as an exercise in speaking Latin, he resolved on a visit to the Dutch universities, a project which he carried out with a singular excess of precaution. From the privy council he obtained the necessary licence for travel. He gave out that he was going, the next vacation, to visit Sir Richard Sandys in Kent, and possibly to drink the Tunbridge waters. From the Kentish coast he took boat for Rotterdam, in a lay habit with 'scarlet cloake' and 'gold hat band'. In Holland he consorted with Roman Catholics as well as Protestants. On his return to Cambridge he met the rumour of his having been beyond the seas with a wonder 'at their silliness, that they would believe so unlikely a relation'. After all he had been outwitted, for Williams, the lord keeper, suspecting some puritan plot, had set a spy on his movements, who sent weekly intelligence of his doings. Master of Emmanuel John Donne was followed by Preston at Lincoln's Inn. In February 1622 John Donne resigned the preachership at Lincoln's Inn, and the benchers elected Preston as his successor. A new chapel, finished soon after his appointment, gave accommodation to the large numbers who flocked to hear him. A more important piece of preferment followed, but it was not obtained without intrigue. Laurence Chaderton, the first master of Emmanuel, had held that post with distinction for thirty-eight years. He had outlived his influential friends, and the fellows thought that to secure Preston's interest with Buckingham would be to the advantage of their college. In particular they wanted a modification of the statutes, which enjoined continuous residence, so cutting them off from chaplaincies and lectureships, and at the same time compelled them to vacate at the standing of DD, whether otherwise provided or not. From Preston's influence they hoped to gain more liberty, as well as to increase the number of college livings. Chaderton thought highly of Preston, but was very reluctant to resign, and doubted whether, if he did, an Arminian might not be appointed. Preston procured a letter from Buckingham (20 September 1622) assuring Chaderton that it was the wish of the king and the prince that he should make way for Preston, and promising him a 'supply of maintenance'. Accordingly Chaderton resigned on 25 September; contrary to statute, the vacancy was not announced, on the plea that all the fellows were in residence; the election took place on 2 October with locked gates, and nothing was known of it at Queens' until Preston was sent for to be admitted as master of Emmanuel. The statutes limited the master's absence to a month in every quarter. This would interfere with Preston's preaching at Lincoln's Inn. His ingenuity found out evasions to which the fellows consented; the statutes condoned absence in case of 'violent detention ' and of 'college business'; a 'moral violence ' was held to satisfy the former condition, and a suit at law about a college living, which lasted some years, formed a colourable pretext for alleging college business. But Preston was inflexible on the point of vacating fellowships. According to Ball, he had been selected by Buckingham to accompany Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester, on a projected embassy to Germany, and was, on this occasion, was made a doctor of divinity by royal mandate. There is probably some confusion here: Chichester's actual expedition to the palatinate was in May–September 1622. Cambridge again Preston was anxious for opportunities of preaching at Cambridge, and listened to proposals in 1624 for putting him into a vacant lectureship at Trinity Church. The other candidate, Middlethwait, fellow of Sidney Sussex, was favoured by Nicholas Felton, Bishop of Ely. The matter was referred to James I, who wanted to keep Preston out of a Cambridge pulpit, and, through Edward Conway (afterwards Viscount Conway), offered him any other preferment at his choice. It was then that Buckingham told Preston he might have the bishopric of Gloucester, vacant by the death of Miles Smith (d. 20 October 1624). But Preston, backed by the townsmen, maintained his ground and got the lectureship. Death of James I He was in attendance as Charles's chaplain at Theobalds on Sunday, 27 March 1625, when James I died, and accompanied Charles and Buckingham to Whitehall, where the public proclamation of Charles's accession was made. For the moment it seemed as if Preston was destined to play an important part in politics. He exerted influence on behalf of his puritan friends, obtaining a general preaching license (20 June 1625) for Arthur Hildersam. But he found his plans counteracted by William Laud. On the plea of a danger of the plague, he closed his college and took a journey into the west. He wanted to consult Davenant at Salisbury about the 'Appello Csesarem' of Richard Montagu, on which Buckingham had asked his judgment. From Salisbury he went on to Dorchester, and thence to Plymouth, where Charles and Buckingham were. When the news reached Plymouth of the disaster at Rochelle (on the 15/16 Sep 1625, when the French under Soubise defeated hired Dutch ships near Rochelle), Preston did his best to excuse and defend Buckingham against the outburst of Protestant indignation. On the removal of Williams from the lord-keepership (30 October 1625), Buckingham 'went so farr as to nominate' Preston to be lord keeper. Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry, who had been counsel for Emmanuel College in the suit above mentioned, was eventually appointed. Preston, however, could not draw the puritans to the side of Buckingham, whom they profoundly distrusted. Preston's friends urged the necessity of a conference on Montagu's books, and nominated on the one side John Buckeridge, Bishop of Rochester, and Francis White, then dean of Carlisle; on the other, Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and Preston. Buckingham played a double part, begging Preston as his friend to decline the conference, and letting others know that he had done with Preston. The conference was held in February 1626 at York House. Preston refused to take part, but came in after it was begun and sat by as a hearer. A second conference followed in the same month, at which Preston took the lead against Montagu and White. When Preston realised that the York House Conference was not likely to favour Puritanism, he encouraged a group of Puritan lawyers, merchants, and clergymen (including Richard Sibbes and John Davenport) to establish an organization known as the Feoffees for the Purchase of Impropriations. Buckingham was elected chancellor of Cambridge University on 1 June 1626. Preston did not oppose his election, as Joseph Mead and others did: but he now felt his position in the university insecure, looked to Lincoln's Inn as a refuge in case he were ousted from Cambridge, and as a last resort contemplated a migration to Basle. A private letter to a member of parliament, in which Preston suggested a line of opposition to Buckingham, came by an accident into Buckingham's hands. Seeing that Preston's influence at court was waning, the fellows of Emmanuel petitioned the king to annul the statute limiting the tenure of their fellowships. Buckingham supported their plea. Preston had the support of Sir Henry Mildmay, the founder's grandson. At length a compromise was reached. Charles suspended the statute (5 May 1627) till such time as six new livings of £100 a year should be annexed to the college. Buckingham was now engaged with his ill-fated expedition (27 June 1627) to the Isle of Ré. In November Preston preached before Charles at Whitehall a sermon which was regarded as prophetic when, on the following Wednesday, news arrived of Buckingham's defeat (8 November) He was not allowed to preach again, but considered that he had obtained a moral victory for his cause. Death of Preston But Preston's health was now breaking; his lungs were diseased, he fell into a rapid decline, and died at a friend's house at Preston-Capes, Northamptonshire, on Sunday, 20 July 1628; When he lay dying, they asked him if he feared death, now that it was so close. \\"No,\\" whispered Preston; \\"I shall change my place, but I shall not change my company.\\"\\"I feel death coming into my heart; my pain shall now be turned into joy\\"Last and Near-Last Words of the Famous, Infamous and Those In-Between By Joseph W. Lewis Jr. M.D. He was buried on 28 July in Fawsley church, John Dod, rector of the neighbouring parish of Fawsley, preaching the funeral sermon. There is no monument to his memory. A fine engraved portrait of him is prefixed to his New Covenant, 1629; it is poorly reproduced in Clarke; there are also two smaller engravings. As Ball describes him, 'he was of an able, firme, well-tempered constitution, comely visage, vigorous and vived eye'. He was unmarried. His will provided for his mother and brothers, founded exhibitions at Emmanuel College, and left his books and furniture to Thomas Ball, his favourite pupil and his minute biographer. Character of Preston Preston's early inclination for diplomacy was symptomatic of his character, which Fuller has summed as that of 'a perfect politician' apt 'to flutter most on that place which was furthest from his eggs'. He had 'great self-command, kept his own counsel, and was impervious to outside criticism'. Only to Ball does he seem to have frankly bared his mind, and Ball's admiring delineation of him furnishes a singular picture of cautious astuteness and constitutional reserve. It is clear that his heart was firmly set on the propagation of the Calvinistic theology; his posthumous works (edited by Richard Sibbes, John Davenport, Thomas Ball, and partly by Thomas Goodwin, D.D.) are a storehouse of argument in its favour.

From Aloïs Delacoux, Biographie des sages-femmes célèbres, anciennes, modernes et contemporaines (Unknown artist. Paris: Trinquart, 1834) Angélique Marguerite Le Boursier du Coudray (c. 1712 – 17 April 1794) was an influential, pioneering midwife during her lifetime, who gained fame when men were taking over the field. She rose from middle-class origins to become noticed and commissioned by King Louis XV himself. Life Angélique Marguerite Le Boursier du Coudray was born into an eminent French medical family in Clermont-Ferrand. In February 1740, at the age of twenty-five, Angélique du Coudray completed her three-year apprenticeship with Anne Bairsin, Dame Philibet Magin, and passed her qualifying examinations at the College of Surgery École de Chirurgie. Within the next few years, the school of surgery had barred female midwives from receiving instruction. After Du Coudray demanded that the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Paris provide instructions to all midwives and midwifery students by signing a petition, she was accepted into the school. In 1743, the status of surgeons, who were all male, was raised and they sought to extend their role into the field of midwifery through denying instruction to female midwives. Du Coudray and other female midwives signed a second petition and accused surgeons of neglecting their duties. She argued that by refusing to instruct female midwives, surgeons were allowing midwives to be improperly trained and so causing a shortage of officially accredited midwives. To prevent harm to patients, and to maintain their professional standing distinct from surgeons, the medical doctors continued to allow women to attend. After the situation was solved and all midwives received proper training, Du Coudray became the head accoucheuse at the Hôtel Dieu in Paris. By guiding and leading in this political matter, she became a prominent figure in Paris. In 1759, she published an early midwifery textbook, Abrégé de l'art des accouchements (Abridgment of the Art of Delivery), which was a revision and expansion of an earlier midwifery textbook published in 1667. In the same year, the king (Louis XV) commissioned her to teach midwifery to peasant women in an attempt to reduce infant mortality. This had become a political concern because a perceived high rural perinatal mortality, following from the deaths in the Seven Years' War, was depleting France of future citizens. Between 1760 and 1783, she traveled all over rural France, sharing her extensive knowledge with poor women. During this period, she is estimated to have taught in over forty French cities and rural towns and to have trained 4,000 students directly. She was also responsible for the training of 6,000 other women, who were taught directly by her former students. In addition, she taught about 500 surgeons and physicians, all of them men. Through this educational effort Du Coudray became a national sensation and international symbol of French medical advancement. Angélique du Coudray died in Bordeaux on April 17, 1794. There is mystery around her death, as it occurred during the Reign of Terror that succeeded the French Revolution. Many scholars believe she was killed during the night because she was previously been commissioned and endorsed by King Louis XV. Others argue that she simply died of old age. =The Machine= The Machine Du Coudray invented the first lifesize obstetrical mannequin, for practicing mock births. It was usually called \\"The Machine.\\" Each cost about 300 livres to construct, usually out of fabric, leather, and stuffing, and occasionally including actual human bones to form the torso. Various strings and straps serve to simulate the stretching of the birth canal and perineum to demonstrate the process of childbirth. The head of the infant mannequin has a shaped nose, stitched ears, hair drawn with ink, and an open mouth (with tongue) into which a finger can be inserted to a depth of . This detail was important, as it allowed the midwife to put two fingers into the mouth, to facilitate the passage of the head in a case of breech presentation. These mannequins were very detailed and accurate. The invention is often attributed to a Scotsman, William Smellie, but the French Academy of Surgeons approved du Coudray's model in 1758, giving her a prior claim on the invention. =Travels= Du Coudray first traveled to Moulins in November 1761 from Claremont France. Le Nain, who had heard and learned a lot about du Coudray's childbirth courses in an exchange with letters with Ballainvilliers, was extremely excited about her arrival. He was one of the first people to secure her services in his city. In her first lesson in Moulins, eighty students appeared and the second lesson brought seventy. Fewer students came because this was also harvest time and many women could not be spared from their farm duties. Du Coudray noted how many women had no aptitude and even sent them home, and only a few women really stood out to her. Her course cost the women 36–40 livres, which included the final certificate of completion. She worked her students hard and taught them just the basics, but even this was enough for them to be extremely useful in their cities. Classes took place six days a week, all morning and all afternoon, and lasted around two months, so that every student had plenty of time to listen to lectures and practice each maneuver several times on the machine. Occasionally she would allow her best students to attend live births with her supervision. In most cities she was paid 300 livres a month of her teaching. Throughout the next year and a half she traveled to Burgundy: to Autun in 1761, Bourg-en-Bresse and Chalone-sur- Saȏne in 1763, and in the same year to Limognes-en-Quercy and Tulle. She then traveled to Angoulȇme in 1764 and Bourdeilles in the same year, then to Poitiers in 1764–65, to Sablés-sur-Sarthe in 1765, and finally to Périgueux and Agen in 1769. She held a similar course of instruction in all these regions of France. In a new development, Du Coudray taught midwives to stop the practice, when an infant was delivered near death, of putting it to one side and focusing on recovery of the mother. She instructed them to attempt to revive the infant, which could be successful. =The Abrégé= The Abrégé de l'art des accouchements contains du Coudray's lectures in the order that she taught them, starting with the female reproductive organs and the process of reproduction. It then explains the issue of proper prenatal care. Finally, it discusses how to deliver infants, including how to handle common obstetric problems. The Abrégé also covers rare cases that occurred during the birth process, which Du Coudray notes as her \\"observations\\". Throughout the book, she refers to her \\"machine\\" as a way to explain concepts. Despite its important contributions to the field of midwifery, the Abrégé was neglected when it was initially published, because it was a small, light, unobtrusive volume. Still, the existence of the book served as an influential model for midwives during the eighteenth century. See also *Louyse Bourgeois, ancestor, midwife to Marie de' Medici.

Democratic Senator Barack Obama of Illinois won the presidential election, and Democrats bolstered their majority in both houses of Congress. Obama won his party's presidential nomination after defeating Senator Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries. With Republican President George W. Bush term-limited, Senator John McCain of Arizona won the Republican nomination in the 2008 Republican primaries. Obama won the general election with 52.9 percent of the popular vote and 365 of the 538 electoral votes. Democrats picked up net gains of eight Senate seats and 21 seats in the House of Representatives. They also won a net gain of one gubernatorial seat. The 2006 elections and 2008 elections represented the first time since the 1930s that one party made substantial gains in Congress in two consecutive elections. The major theme during the campaign was the American public's general desire of change and reform from both Washington and the policies of President Bush. The economy and other domestic policies were also dominant issues, especially during the last months of the campaign after the onset of the 2008 economic crisis. Federal races =President= Senator Barack Obama of Illinois was the Democratic nominee, and Senator John McCain of Arizona was the Republican nominee. Incumbent President George W. Bush was ineligible for re-election per the 22nd Amendment, which limits a president to two terms, and incumbent Vice President Dick Cheney declined to run for the office. The 2008 presidential election was the first since 1952 in which neither an incumbent president nor an incumbent vice president was a candidate. Senator Obama won the number of electors necessary to be elected president and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. =United States Senate= The 33 seats in the United States Senate Class 2 were up for election, plus special Senate elections in Mississippi and Wyoming. The resignation of Mississippi Senator Trent Lott, and the death of Wyoming Senator Craig L. Thomas, both Class 1 senators, meant that both of those states' senate seats were up for election. The Democrats won 8 seats while the Republicans did not gain a seat. = United States House of Representatives = All seats in the House were up for election, including seats of the 435 voting representatives from the states and the 6 non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. This marked the first time that the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands selected a delegate to Congress. Democrats won the nationwide popular vote for the House of Representatives by 7.2 percentage points, gaining 21 seats. They increased their total number of seats to 257, the largest number of seats held by either party in the House since Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 elections. State races Partisan control of state governments after the 2008 elections: =Governors= Eleven of the fifty United States governors were up for re- election, as were the governorships of two U.S. territories. Eight incumbent state governors were running for re-election, while the retirements of Ruth Ann Minner of Delaware, Matt Blunt of Missouri, and Mike Easley of North Carolina left those gubernatorial positions open. The incumbent governors of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, and American Samoa, Togiola Tulafono, were also up for re-election. The only governorship that changed party hands was in Missouri: Democrat Jay Nixon was elected to replace Blunt, who chose to retire instead of seeking a second term. =State legislatures= The New Hampshire Senate saw the election of the first ever female majority. This is first time this has occurred in any chamber of any state legislature in United States history. The New York State Assembly, New York State Senate, and Governor's mansion were controlled by the Democrats for the first time since the Great Depression. Overall, the Democrats took control of six legislative bodies to the Republicans' four. Democrats took control of the Delaware House of Representatives, for the first time since 1985, the Montana House of Representatives, the Nevada Senate, the New York State Senate, for only the second time since WWII, the Ohio House of Representatives, and the Wisconsin State Assembly. Republicans took control of the Montana Senate; both houses of the Tennessee General Assembly, for the first time since reconstruction; and the Oklahoma Senate, for the first time in state history. After the election, Democrats controlled both houses in the state legislatures of 27 states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Republicans controlled both houses in the state legislatures of 14 states: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Eight states had divided legislatures: Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Nebraska has a unicameral non- partisan legislature. =Initiatives and referenda= thumbright400px Vote for same-sex marriage ban by counties: Vote against same-sex marriage ban by counties: * State constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage are passed in three states: Arizona, California, and Florida.

Move to the National Liberals At the end of the war, Evans was again adopted as Liberal candidate for Denbigh and fought the seat at the 1945 general election. He was defeated by 4,922 votes. He resumed his legal training and was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn in 1946. With a Labour government in power, Evans became attracted by the reforms proposed to the Liberal National organisation which had been allied to the Conservative Party since 1931. When a joint statement of principles of Liberals and Conservatives was published in a pamphlet called \\"Design for Freedom\\" in February 1947, Evans was one of the signatories.\\"'Design For Freedom'\\", The Times, 19 February 1947, p. 2. Although the full merger was not agreed, the Liberal Nationals were reorganised into the National Liberal Party later in 1947, and Evans joined. Election for Denbigh The sitting National Liberal Member of Parliament for Denbigh, Sir Henry Morris-Jones, announced his retirement. Evans was selected as his replacement by the local National Liberal Association in April 1948; he then attended several local branches of the Conservative Association (with whom the National Liberals were in alliance) to reassure them, and committed himself to defeating the Labour government.D. Dutton, \\"A Stepping Stone for Wavering Radicals\\", p. 113. This reassurance worked and he was adopted as candidate in November 1949.\\"Liberal Adoption\\", The Times, 12 November 1949, p. 2. The election saw some confusion as the National Liberals claimed the official mantle of Liberalism; Evans, who faced a Liberal opponent, demanded that the electors were informed whether their Liberal candidate would back Conservatives or Labour in the event that the Liberals held the balance of power.\\"Liberalism In Danger In Wales\\", The Times, 20 February 1950, p. 8. Garner Evans himself broke the spirit of the 'Woolton-Teviot Agreement' between Conservatives and National Liberals by referring to himself as a 'National Liberal' only on his election literature.D. Dutton, \\"A Stepping Stone for Wavering Radicals\\", p. 114. He won the seat with a narrow majority of 1,209 over the Liberal candidate, and only 38.9% of the total vote. Evans made his maiden speech in June 1950 in support of the United Kingdom joining the Schuman Plan, but his main point was to call on the Labour Party to get back to idealism and internationalism and reject the 'economic nationalism' outlined by Chancellor of the Exchequer Stafford Cripps.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 28 June 1950, p. 2. He was re-elected in the 1951 general election with a much improved majority of 7,915 over Labour; the previous Liberal candidate had taken a job in Switzerland and his replacement could not get established.\\"Shock For Liberals In North Wales\\", The Times, 23 October 1951, p. 7. Campaigns In Parliament Evans was made Secretary to the Parliamentary Committee on Atomic Energy. He pressed for more help for his constituents: in December 1953 he stated that the best aid the Government could give to agriculture in Wales was a marketing policy,\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 9 December 1953, p. 4. and in November 1954 he insisted that the Home Secretary could not manage Welsh affairs without additional ministerial help and called for new Minister of State in the House of Lords.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 25 November 1954, p. 11. Early in 1955, Evans was one of six Members of Parliament to visit the British Army of the Rhine and bring back a report calling for National Servicemen to be paid the same as the regular Army, among other changes.\\"Pay 'Grouse' In B.A.O.R.\\", The Times, 11 February 1955, p. 4. Welsh affairs There was some local criticism of Garner Evans as the Parliament wore on. In December 1954 an extraordinary meeting of the Conservative Central Council in the constituency was called to hear a report on a complaint against him: it was alleged that he had addressed a meeting in Llanrwst when \\"not in a fit condition to do so\\". The meeting passed a vote recording its displeasure, but also adopted him as its candidate for the next election.D. Dutton, \\"A Stepping Stone for Wavering Radicals\\", p. 118. The return of the popular Liberal candidate from 1950 ensured that Evans' majority was cut in the 1955 general election to 4,641.\\"The Times House of Commons, 1955\\", p. 203. Evans spoke in January 1956 in favour of encouraging the Welsh language through education and broadcasting, arguing that Welsh nationalism was caused by fear of the loss of language and culture.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 31 January 1956, p. 12. When the Government appointed a minister with responsibility for Welsh Affairs, Evans echoed Labour complaints about the lowly status of the new minister and described his powers as \\"nebulous\\".\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 16 December 1957, p. 11. Political stances Evans was generally loyal in his voting behaviour in the House of Commons although he did twice rebel against the whip on minor technical issues.Philip Norton, \\"Dissension in the House of Commons\\" (Macmillan, 1975), pp. 88, 132. The issues were allowing the cross-examination of officials proposing the compulsory purchase of forests, and increasing the transitional period of a new rating system. He supported the ending of capital punishment on a free vote in 1956.\\"Vote Against Hanging\\", The Times, 18 February 1956, p. 3. When S. O. Davies introduced the Government of Wales Bill in 1955 which would have created a devolved Welsh Parliament, Evans questioned whether the Welsh people supported it,Hansard, HC 5ser vol 537 col 2520. and went on to vote against the Bill making any progress.Hansard, HC 5ser vol 537 cols 2527-8. Relations with the Conservatives Continuing concerns at Garner Evans' political and personal performance both in Parliament and in the constituency prompted a meeting of the Conservative Central Council to be called in May 1958. Despite Garner Evans pleading to the meeting that \\"I have spent pretty well all my life trying to bring Liberals and Conservatives together\\", the delegates passed a motion of no confidence in their Member of Parliament by 44 to 15.D. Dutton, \\"A Stepping Stone for Wavering Radicals\\", p. 119. The association President then said that he would then move to discuss with the National Liberals how to select a candidate acceptable to both parties.\\"Conservatives to Press for New Candidate\\", The Times, 16 May 1958, p. 4. In November 1958 Conservative Central Office reported that Evans had told them he would not be a candidate for re-election.\\"42 Members Not To Seek Re- Election\\", The Times, 7 November 1958, p. 7. The Conservative Association subsequently selected Geraint Morgan. This situation put the National Liberals in a quandary as they had not withdrawn support from Garner Evans. In July 1958 he issued a statement to his electors pledging continued support for the Government and urging the Conservatives not to take any \\"hasty action\\" which might place his and other National Liberal seats in jeopardy. The same month, a meeting of the National Liberals pledged support for him; however the Conservatives undertook prolonged negotiations.D. Dutton, \\"A Stepping Stone for Wavering Radicals\\", p. 120. It was only on the eve of the 1959 general election that a deal worked out by Conservative Chairman Lt-Col. J. C. Wynne- Edwards was agreed under which Morgan agreed to run as a 'Conservative and National Liberal' candidate. Morgan spoke to the National Liberals and persuaded them to pledge official support to him.\\"National Liberals to Support Conservative\\", The Times, 2 September 1959, p. 6. During the election campaign, the Liberal candidate attacked the Conservatives for withdrawing support from Evans.\\"East Flint Eyes Labour Steel Plans Askance\\", The Times, 8 October 1959, p. 3.

Harris was a keen sportsman, who was a free- scoring amateur centre-forward once scoring 89 goals in one season, a speedway rider at Thrum Hall, Halifax and president of Bradford Conservative Games League. In February 1949 he was elected honorary treasurer of the newly formed Bradford City A.F.C. Shareholders and Supporters Association and was later co- opted on to the Bradford City board. As a former footballer he helped assistant manager George Jowett during the 1949-50 season while manager David Steele was ill with heart trouble in Bradford Royal Infirmary. When Steele's contract was bought out in February 1952 three months before it was due to end, Harris was appointed interim manager while the board of directors chose a new manager. He handled team affairs for just three months taking them to 15th in Division Three (North). He handed over to Ivor Powell and reverted to his director's duties. Harris resigned from the board in October 1956 but was coaxed out of retirement less than two years later to become vice-chairman. In October 1962 he succeeded Herbert Munro, who resigned through ill-health, as chairman of the club. He remained in the role for just over three years but continued as a board member. He was also elected a life member of Bradford City.

He was killed, serving as an officer with the Scots Guards on the Western Front.Baby of the House Biography Memorial to Charles Thomas Mills in St John the Baptist's Church, Hillingdon Architectural plans for the Mills memorial by Ambrose Macdonald Poynter and George Wenyon from The Building News 26 July 1916 Born on 13 March 1887, he was the eldest son of Charles William Mills, 2nd Baron Hillingdon (1855–1919) who served as Conservative Member of Parliament for Sevenoaks from 1885 to 1892, and his wife Alice Marion Harbord, daughter of Charles Harbord, 5th Baron Suffield. He processed at the coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra in 1902 with Lord Suffield who was Master of the Robes. He joined the family bank Glyn, Mills, Currie & Co. in 1910. He and his father were meant to be on the maiden voyage of the Titanic but stayed home due to his father's ill health. Mills was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for the Uxbridge Division of Middlesex at the January 1910 general election and re-elected in the December 1910 election. In his first parliament, he was the 'Baby of the House', the youngest MP. He was first commissioned as an army officer in April 1908 in the West Kent (Queen's Own) Yeomanry and promoted lieutenant in 1912. He transferred from the Territorial Force to the Scots Guards in May 1915. He was killed in action on 6 October 1915 at Hulluch during the Battle of Loos while a lieutenant with 2nd Battalion, the Scots Guards. He was unmarried. As he has no known grave, Mills is commemorated on the Loos Memorial. He is also commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs who died fighting in the First World War; and by a plaque in Hillingdon's parish church. Mills is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A fifth commemoration is the production in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of his life and death. The inscription on the memorial erected to his memory by his family in St John the Baptist's Church, Hillingdon contains two quotes: \\"He greeted the unseen with a cheer.\\" (recalling a line from Robert Browning's poem Epilogue); and \\"So he passed over and the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.\\" (from The Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan). His brother Arthur Mills succeeded him, unopposed, as Member of Parliament for Uxbridge.

The Nashville Sounds Minor League Baseball team has played in Nashville, Tennessee, since its establishment in 1978. As of the cancellation of the 2020 season, 1,314 players have competed in at least one regular season game for the Sounds. Of those, 932 have also played in at least one game for a Major League Baseball (MLB) team. Six additional players have appeared for the Sounds only in postseason games, one of whom has also played in the majors. Encompassing both regular and postseason play, 1,320 players have competed for the Sounds; 933 of those have also played in Major League Baseball. The team was established as an expansion team of the Double-A Southern League in 1978, in which it competed through 1984. While at that class level, Nashville was affiliated with Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (1978–1979) and New York Yankees (1980–1984). The Sounds moved to the Triple-A American Association in 1985 and then to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998. At this class level, the team has been affiliated with the Detroit Tigers (1985–1986), Cincinnati Reds (1987–1992), Chicago White Sox (1993–1997), Pittsburgh Pirates (1998–2004), Milwaukee Brewers (2005–2014), Oakland Athletics (2015–2018), and Texas Rangers (2019–present). Seventy-three of the team's players have distinguished themselves after their playing time with Nashville by winning a Major League Baseball award, being named to a major league All-Star team, or being elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Ryan Braun, Barry Larkin, Don Mattingly, and Willie McGee have won Most Valuable Player Awards. Doug Drabek and R.A. Dickey have won the Cy Young Award. Jason Bay, Ryan Braun, and Chris Sabo have won Rookie of the Year Awards. Bob Melvin and Buck Showalter have won the Manager of the Year Award. Prince Fielder and Aramis Ramírez have won Hank Aaron Awards. Nelson Cruz and Khris Davis have won the Edgar Martínez Award.

The single known species is Judinornis nogontsavensis. Its fossils have been found in Nemegt Formation rocks of southern Mongolia, and though the age of these deposits is not fully resolved, Judinornis probably lived some 70 million years ago during the early Maastrichtian. The Nemegt Formation does not seem to contain marine sediments. Consequently, and unlike its relatives, this was apparently a bird of estuaries and rivers running from the mountains thrown up by the Cimmerian orogeny through the arid lands of continental East Asia towards the Turgai Sea and the former Shigatze Ocean. Judinornis was a member of the Hesperornithes, flightless toothed seabirds of the Cretaceous.

It depicts a conflict between a freedom-loving anarchist rebel named Nomakh (anagram alluding to Nestor Makhno) and Bolshevik commissar Rassvetov, who dreams of forcefully modernized Russia. Yesenin was moved to writing the poem after bitter contemplations on Russian rebellion in drama Pugachev. Other motifs include his reflections on the nature of business-driven modern United States, visited by Yesenin around the time of the poem composition. After the publication the poem was seen as a critique of Soviet rule. Its contents could be interpreted as an apology of peasant (or \\"anarchist\\") rebellion or casting of Bolshevik order as an artificial one, imposed on the people by non-Russian commissars. Following the Land of Scoundrels Yesenin went on to bitter Moscow of Taverns finished next year and even tried to provide repentance of sorts by publication of Russia of Soviets compilation in 1925. Contemporary commentators agree that questions posed by Yesenin in the poem more than eighty years ago still have immediate bearing for today's Russia: to what extent the Russian people is responsible for the current state of affairs, whether the end of the old regime was brought by peasants' love for freedom or was imposed by foreign influences, and to whom belongs the country's future. http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2001/17/32.html \\"Land of Scoundrels?\\" article in Novaya Gazeta Synopsis The action takes place in the Ural region in 1919. The main protagonist is gangster Nomakh who is shown as a romantic rebel and anarchist hating \\"those getting fat on Marx\\". In past he held revolutionary ideas in hopes of liberation of mankind, these aspirations (in their peasant interpretation) were close to Yesenin himself. In the poem Nomakh expresses many of Yesenin's own deep thoughts on love for rebellion and hatred for the unnatural and 'un-Russian' order imposed on Russia by Bolshevik commissars. His adversary Rassvetov (from Russian \\"rassvet\\", the raise of new day) is a commissar and his portrait is bleak and schematic comparing to character of Nomakh. Aside from their juxtaposition, one character trait unifying both Nomakh and Rassvetov is their unscrupulousness. Nomakh talks of many gangs multiplying in Russia and of growing ranks of disillusioned rebels ready to kill and plunder. He is full of disregard and contempt to \\"sheep for whom the shepherd is nurturing knives\\". This is matched by Rassvetov's amorality who before the revolution participated in gold trading stings on Klondike and whose paramount aim is his own survival. Rassvetov is convinced that fraud is acceptable as a mean to redistribute wealth from rich to poor. He dreams of a \\"steel enema for the whole of Russia\\" that will transform and modernize the country. Nomakh mounts a successful raid on a train passing Ural line. The poem opens with former factory worker Zamarashkin (from Russian \\"Zamarashka\\" - puny, albeit likable, squalid person) standing guard near the rail line. He is confronted by irate commissar Chekistov (made-up name meaning literally \\"Cheka man\\") who engages in a long diatribe telling of his contempt for Russians being lazy, insensitive and brutal savages. Zamarashkin retorts that Chekistov's real name is Leibman and even despite the fact he arrived to Russia from Weimar he really should belong to some shtetl in the Mogilev area. When Chekistov leaves Nomakh appears: he knows Zamarashkin personally and suggests that the latter should join the band. Zamarashkin refuses, so the gangsters tie him with rope then take control over the rail semaphores, which allows them to stop the train. Rassvetov is on the train with gold cargo and along with other commissars (named Charin and Lobok) engaged in conversation on the future \\"americanized\\" Russia, suggesting that the present republic \\"is a bluff\\". Nomakh raids the train, plundering the gold and blowing up the engine. Following the raid the pursuit after Nomakh begins: it is headed by Rassvetov and the best bet is enlisting the detective, Chinese communist Litza Hun. Litza Hun tracks Nomakh to an underground tavern where former white officers, now drunkards, are smoking opium in nostalgic dreams of the lost glory of Imperial Russia. Nomakh and another gangster named Barsuk (Russian for Badger) show contempt to their sentiments for times past. Nomakh (followed by Litza Hun) heads to Kiev where the detective tries to arrest him. In the final part of the poem Chekistov discovers that Nomakh has outwitted the detective and has disappeared. Nomakh hides behind the Peter the Great portrait on the wall and (probably symbolically) surveys the scene through Peter's eyes. One of the possible interpretations http://briefly.ru/esenin/strana_negodjaev Story synopsis and very brief summary (in Russian) is that Yesenin is undecided whether the future belongs to anarchist rebel Nomakh (who emerges as a victor) or to cynical Rassvetov; however the point is made that likes of Chekistov, Litza Hun, along with featureless commissars Charin and Lobok, or drunk white officers, are clear losers.

In 1622, his service was rewarded by his assignment as daimyō of Sekiyado Domain. Shigemune's court title was Suō no Kami. Biography Shigemune was the eldest son of Itakura Katsushige. He was chosen to be one of Tokugawa Ieyasu's pages at a young age, and Ieyasu is said to have liked Shigemune greatly. Shigemune took part in both the Battle of Sekigahara and the Siege of Osaka Castle. His childhood name was Jusaburo (十三郎). In 1620, Shigemune was appointed to the position as the third Kyoto Shoshidai;Murdoch, James. (1996). A History of Japan, p. 10. and he would continue in this significant role for over 30 years (1620–1654). As shoshidai, he was actively and personally engaged as the head of a network of spies tasked to discover and report any covert sources of sedition, insurrection or other kinds of unrest.Murdoch, p. 134. In the subtle currents of shogunate politics, he is said to have gone to great lengths to develop a sense of impartiality in judgement. When approached with a case to judge, he would place a lantern between himself and the speaker, and busy himself with making tea, so that he would not let external appearances interfere with his sense of justice. Shigemune was expected to guard the palace and to supervise court officials; but over time, he learned that this office was no sinecure. For example, when Emperor Go-Kōmyō took fencing lessons, Shigemune is reported to have threatened to commit suicide, and Go-Kōmyō is said to have replied, \\"I have never seen a military man kill himself, and the spectacle will be interesting. You had better have a platform erected in the palace grounds so that your exploit can be witnessed.\\"Porter, Robert. (2001). Japan: the Rise of a Modern Power, p. 65.

In 1739, Hosokawa Munetake of Higo was killed inside Edo Castle by Itakura Katsukane, and the killer was ordered to commit suicide as just punishment; however, Shōgun Yoshimune personally intervened to mitigate untoward adverse consequences for the killer's fudai family.Screech, Timon.

While it intensified play between the Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Rough Riders, and Kingston Granites, it also exposed Hamilton as the weaker of the four. However, the Tigers returned to form in 1903 and would proceed to dominate all competition in the ORFU, winning four consecutive championships. There were, however, several disputes with the Canadian Rugby Union and the Quebec Rugby Football Union that prevented the Tigers from competing for a national championship from 1903-1905. It was not until 1906, where the Tigers finally agreed to play the QRFU rules, that Hamilton defeated McGill University anyway, by a score of 29–3, to become Dominion Champions. =Interprovincial Rugby Football Union= The Hamilton Tigers playing an unknown Ottawa team, 1910 The Interprovincial Rugby Football Union was formed on September 13, 1907 in an amalgamation of the Tigers and Toronto Argonauts of the ORFU and the Ottawa Rough Riders and the Montreal Football Club of the QRFU. In 1908, the Tigers would win the last national championship to be awarded before the introduction of the Grey Cup trophy in 1909. The team would face local competition with the newly formed Ontario Rugby Football Union's Hamilton Alerts who, in 1912, won the city of Hamilton its first Grey Cup by beating the Toronto Argonauts 11–4. The Alerts having challenged the authority of the ORFU during that season, would not be reinstated into the union, so many of its players joined the Tigers in the off-season. The Tigers would go on to win their first Grey Cup over the Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club in 1913 by a score of 44-2. They would win their second Grey Cup two years later in the last Grey Cup game to be played before World War I interrupted play for three years. After the Great War, the Tigers struggled to return to the title game, while only qualifying for post-season play twice in the following seven years and losing to Queen's both times. It was not until 1927 that Hamilton once again reached the Grey Cup by defeating Queen's, but losing to the Toronto Balmy Beach Beachers. However, their fortunes would change as they played the Regina Roughriders in the first radio play-by-play broadcast Grey Cup game in a 30-3 victory for the Tabbies. The Tigers would again post victories over the Roughriders the next year in 1929 and again in 1932 in convincing fashion. However, the Tigers would earn the dubious distinction of becoming the first team to lose to a team based in Western Canada, to the Winnipeg 'Pegs in the 23rd Grey Cup. After their loss to Winnipeg, the fortunes of the Tigers waned as they did not have a winning record in the next five years. In 1941, the Hamilton Tigers suspended operations due to many of its players joining the army to fight in the Second World War. Hamilton Tiger-Cats =Post-war= After the Tigers folded, a new team was formed in 1941 to begin play in the ORFU named the Hamilton Wildcats. The Wildcats enjoyed success in Steeltown after having won the Grey Cup in 1943 and having outstanding regular season records. The Tigers resumed operations in 1945 along with the rest of the IRFU, but, due to poor play by the Tigers and superb play by the Wildcats, the Tigers found it difficult to compete in the Hamilton market. More importantly, the Tigers were experiencing monetary disputes with the IRFU over allocations of revenue. After signing Frank Filchock, who had been suspended by the NFL due to gambling issues, the Tigers felt that the other teams in the IRFU should share in the payment of his high salary because they were benefiting from higher attendances when he was playing in their cities. After the IRFU refused, the Tigers made an arrangement with the ORFU and transferred to that league, with the Wildcats switching to the IRFU on April 9, 1948. CFL 1940s The switch proved to be a costly one as Filchock left to join the Montreal Alouettes in 1949 and the Tigers were left out of the IRFU. Not only that, but both the Tigers and the Wildcats were struggling to compete for fan support and the financial repercussions started to mount. As a result, local prominent citizens including Ralph W. Cooper, Frank M. Gibson, C.C. Lawson, and Sam Manson decided that the two clubs should amalgamate and operate as one entity. As such, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats football club began play in 1950 in the IRFU as the singular representative of the city of Hamilton.

Life Walrond was the second but eldest surviving son of William Walrond, 1st Baron Waleran, by Elizabeth Katharine Pitman, daughter of James Samuel Pitman, of Dunchideock House, Devon, High Sheriff of Devon in 1856. In August 1902 he was appointed First secretary to Sir Alexander Acland-Hood, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury. He succeeded his father as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tiverton in 1906, as seat he held until his death in 1915. He served as Secretary to the First Lord of the Treasury. Walrond married Charlotte Margaret Lothian Coats, daughter of George Coats, later Baron Glentanar, in 1904. They had two sons, one of whom William Walrond eventually succeeded in the barony of Waleran. He died, aged 39, of wounds received in action on 2 November 1915 while serving as a lieutenant with the Royal Army Service Corps during the First World War. He is buried in the churchyard at All Saints' Chapel, Bradfield, the chapel to Bradfield House, at the time the seat of the Walrond family. Walrond is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. Walrond is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of Walrond.

In time, the government constructs a spaceship which uses the paint as a propulsion system. The spaceship is launched prematurely after Danny and Joe follow Professor Bullfinch and Dr. Grimes on a tour of the ship. A mechanical failure dooms the four to a trip out of the Solar System unless they can repair the ship. Should they fail in this, they will drift too far from the Sun and freeze to death. Current science The book was published in 1956, one year before the start of the Space Age. It explores the aspects of actual space exploration versus science fiction. Danny's teacher, in an effort to get him to stop daydreaming about space adventures, punishes him by making him write repeatedly \\"Space travel is at least one hundred years away\\".

An Idiot proof design which prevents accidental cutting of an operator's limb In modern English usage, the informal term idiot-proof or foolproof describes designs that cannot be misused either inherently, or by use of defensive design principles. The implication is that the design is usable even by someone of low intelligence who would not use it properly. The term \\"foolproof\\" originates in 1902. The term \\"idiot-proof\\" became popular in the 1970s. It may have been invented as a stronger-sounding version of foolproof, as the force of foolproof had declined due to frequent usage. Perhaps for the same reason, \\"foolproof\\" is now a formal term, whereas \\"idiot- proof\\" remains informal. Both terms are originally adjectives (\\"a foolproof plan\\"), but can be used as verbs (\\"foolproof this design\\"). Several Murphy's law adages claim that idiot-proof systems cannot be made, for example \\"Nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently talented fool\\" and \\"If you make something idiot-proof, someone will just make a better idiot.\\" Along those lines, Douglas Adams wrote in Mostly Harmless, \\"a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools\\".Douglas, Adams.

The book is \\"about a boy who invents a machine to do his homework for him only to be tricked into doing more with his spare time\\". The book was first published in 1958 and originally illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats. This is the first novel in the series to feature Irene. Plot Danny uses a computer that Professor Bullfinch has created for NASA to prepare his homework, despite Professor Bullfinch's warning that Danny is to leave the machine alone. With his friend Joe Pearson and his new neighbor, Irene Miller, Danny has some success with the machine before it is sabotaged. Danny figures out what is wrong with the machine and corrects the problem. Danny's teacher also learns about the machine, and has her ideas for the Homework Champions. Once she finds out, she thinks of a way to trick the kids. Current science The \\"homework machine\\" is in the style of the large mainframe computers of the 1950s, and one that uses paper punched cards. The concept of students using computers for research is common today; however, this computer was not merely a machine via which the drudgery of solving many three or four digit long division problems could be offloaded; it was also somehow able to accept \\"programming\\" of students' text books that enabled it to write reports on topics that were covered by the text books. Miscellania Amateur radio is used for the first (and possibly only) time in the series, with Danny and Irene attempting to get a homework question answered. The callsigns used would have been accurate for mid-western operators in that era but not for the mode used (shortwave). In any event, there was too much static and the kids resorted to opening the windows and talking across the alley. Reception Floyd C. Gale wrote in the August 1959 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction that the book was \\"another funful adventure\\".

S. Ruckle, Henry Olmstead, and J. O. Van Bergen. It was incorporated in Washington because of a lack of corporate laws in Oregon, though it paid Oregon taxes. The company operated steamships between San Francisco and ports along the Columbia River at Astoria, Portland and The Dalles, serving the lumber and salmon fishing industries.Laubaugh, Glenn. The Oregon Steam Navigation Company and its Related Portage Tramways, Pacific Northwest Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society A railroad was built to serve the steamship industry. Formation of the monopoly The company was incorporated on December 29, 1860, at Vancouver, Washington, with 22 shareholders. Principal shareholders included D. F. Bradford (one of the owners of the north bank portage railway at the Cascades), Jacob Kamm, Harrison Olmstead, Simeon G. Reed, R. R. Thompson, and steamboat captains John C. Ainsworth and L. W. Coe. The company then gained control over most of the boats on the Columbia and Snake rivers. Timmen described the Oregon Steam Navigation Company as \\"the many-tentacled monopoly of river transportation.\\" From 1858 to 1863, the Oregon Portage Railroad operated 4.5 miles of track between Bonneville and Cascade. The railroad hauled primarily military and immigrant traffic. In 1862, the railroad was sold to the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company for $155,000. Soon afterwards, the company acquired most of the steamboats on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company purchased the Oregon Steam Navigation Company in 1879. * On the lower Columbia, the company's boats included Senorita, Fashion (ex-James P. Flint), Julia (Barclay), Belle (of Oregon City), Mountain Buck, and Carrie Ladd. * On the middle Columbia, boats were Mary, Hassaloe, Wasco, and Idaho. * On the upper Columbia, the company ran the Tenino and the Colonel Wright.Timmen, Franz: Blow for the Landing, A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West, at 14, 17, and 27, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID, 1973  Competitors bought off  In 1862, river transport concerns not involved with the Oregon Steam Navigation Company formed the People's Transportation Company. The new competitor put the E.D. Baker on the lower Columbia, the Iris on the middle, and the Kiyus on the upper Cascades.Affleck, Edward L., A Century of Paddlewheelers in the Pacific Northwest, the Yukon, and Alaska, at 43, Alexander Nicholls Press, Vancouver, BC (2000) These boats posed serious competition to the monopoly, so much so that in about 1864, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company paid its rival $10,000 a year to confine its operations to the Willamette River. Oregon Steam Navigation Company also picked up People's Transportation's boats Iris and Kiyus, in exchange for three OSN boats on the Willamette River, Onward, Rival, and Surprise. Expansion of fleet Traffic increased in the early 1860s, so in 1863 and 1864, OSN added the Nez Perce Chief, the Webfoot, the Owyhee and the Yakima, all built at Celilo on the upper Columbia, and the Mississippi-style side-wheeler Oneonta on the middle river. OSN also purchased the side-wheeler New World to work the lower Columbia. By 1878, OSN had added to its fleet the sternwheelers Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West. Struggle for the portages The Dalles-Celilo portage railroad in 1867 looking west towards \\"Cape Horn\\". Control of the portages was critical to control of the river. OSN controlled all the portages, including both the north and the south portage railways around the Cascades (which had once been in competition with each other) as well as a portage system that had been built around Celilo Falls by one Orlando Humason. In 1863, the company replaced the mule-drawn portage railway on the north side of the Cascades with a steam locomotive. The company also built a steam railway from the Dalles around Celilo Falls, which opened on April 23, 1863 and cost $1 million to build. Cascades of the Columbia * Cascade Portage and railroad, Washington side, 1867 *Oregon \\"Pony,\\" first steam engine in Oregon, used on portage railroad Competition The People's Transportation Company was organized in 1862 to compete with the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. The company then began a rate war with the O.S.N. People's Transportation was so successful that O.S.N. bought them off with an agreement to pay them $10,000 a year for ten years if People's Transportation would restrict its operations to the Willamette River.

Tale of Aqhat The text in Corpus Tablettes Alphabétiques [CTA] 17–19 is often referred to as the Epic of Aqhat. Danel was depicted as \\"judging the cause of the widow, adjudicating the case of the fatherless\\" in the city gate.Ancient Near Eastern Texts, 149–51. He passed through trials: his son Aqhat was destroyed but apparently in the missing conclusion was revived or replaced by Danel's patron god, Rp'u, who sits and judges with Hadad and Astarte and was likely considered to be the equivalent of El. The text was published and translated in 1936 by Charles VirolleaudVirolleaud, \\"La légende phénicienne de Danel\\" vol. I of Mission de Ras Shamra, C. F.-A. Schaeffer, ed. (Paris) 1936. and has been extensively analysed since then.See references section.  Danel and the Book of Ezekiel  Three verses in the Book of Ezekiel (, , and ) refer to \\"Danel\\" which, according to the Masoretic Text, should be read as \\"Daniel\\". This notwithstanding, parallels and contrasts with Danel (without i)NIV footnote on Ezekiel 14:14 of the Book of Ezekiel, placed between Noah and JobEzekiel xiv.14, 20 and invoked as the very example of righteous judgement,Ezekiel xxviii. 3 in an apostrophe to the prince of Tyre, \\"you are indeed wiser than Daniel\\". first pointed out by René Dussaud in 1931,René Dussaud, \\"Breves remarques sur les tablettes de Ras Shamra\\", Syria 12 (1931:77). have led readers commonly to accept (Day 1980) or occasionally to reject H. H. P. Dressler, \\"The identification of the Ugaritic Dnil with the Daniel of Ezekiel\\", Vetus Testamentum 29 (1979:152–61): \\"To sum up the Ugaritic material: Dnil is neither king, nor wise, nor righteous, nor able to save his son.\\" (p. 155). Danel not meeting Dressler's definition of kingship, is termed \\"a village-elder or chief\\" (p. 153).Wallace, Daniel B., “Who is Ezekiel’s Daniel?” a degree of identification with Ugaritic Danel of the \\"Aqhat text\\", amounting virtually to the same figure.The author of the Book of Daniel, a contemporary of Ezekiel exiled in Babylon, is not concerned here; the common assumption is that \\"features of the Daniel alluded to by Ezekiel have contributed to the depiction of the hero of the book of Daniel\\" (Day 1980:174). Christianist readers still assert the identity of the two figures. The three figures referred to in — \\"Even if Noah, Danel and Job were in it...\\" — links the name with two non-Israelites of great antiquity. In , Danel is one noted for his wisdom in the prophecy addressed to the king of Tyre: \\"you are indeed wiser than Danel, no secret is hidden from you\\". The name \\"Danel\\" had a long tradition in Hebrew culture: he is supplied as the father- in-law of Enoch in Jubilees.Jubilees iv.20, noted by Day 1980:181: Jubilees, which supplies many \\"missing\\" names from the Hebrew Bible, was written considerably later than the book of Ezekiel. Texts in the Ugaritic language, a Canaanite tongue, may provide an important clue. The language was discovered by French archaeologists in 1928 and known only from texts found in the lost city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), Syria.Edward L. Greenstein, \\"Texts from Ugarit Solve Biblical Puzzles,\\" BAR 36:06, Nov/Dec 2010, pp. 48-53, 70. Found at Biblical Archaeology Review website, accessed October 29, 2010. Ugaritic has been used by scholars of the Old Testament to clarify Biblical Hebrew texts and has revealed ways in which ancient Israelite culture finds parallels in the neighboring cultures. Ugaritic was \\"the greatest literary discovery from antiquity since the deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform.\\" at p.99 Literary texts discovered at Ugarit include the Aqhat Epic (or Legend of Danel) — all revealing a Canaanite religion. According to Edward L. Greenstein, a distinguished professor at Bar-Ilan University, Ugaritic texts solved the biblical puzzle of the anachronism of Ezekiel mentioning Daniel at ; it is because in both Ugaritic and the Ancient Hebrew texts, it is correctly Danel—the yod is missing in the originals. Danel would fit the pattern of being an ancient non-Israelite like Job and Noah. Ezekiel's literary arrangement may also support this position. Yahweh has compared Judah with foreign nations before (), and the context appears to contain similar comparison in . The hypothetical rebellious country, while a cipher for Israel, is not specifically named and could represent any ancient Near Eastern country. Ezekiel's audience is clearly enamored with non- Israelite myths (cf. Tammuz in ), and so they could easily be aware of King Danel's legendary virtues. Thus, Ezekiel's triad, if they were three ancient, righteous, non-Israelite men, would fit the pattern of Yahweh judging Israel to some degree by the nations around them.College Press NIV Commentary on Ezekiel By Brandon Fredenburg, p. 138 The connection is more plausible when one considers that Ezekiel alludes to Danel in an oracle against Tyre (Eze. 28), for the cultures of Ugarit and Tyre were both Canaanite.Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible By David Noel Freedman, Allen C. Myers, Astrid B. Beck, p. 311 Danel also had a son and, like Job, was unable to deliver him from divine harm (cf. ).Walther Eichrodt, Ezekiel: A Commentary, trans. Cosslett Quinn, Old Testament Library (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1970), p. 189  Recent uses  The name Danel has been given to one of the craters on Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter.

Founding of quilombos Almost all the slave rebellions had been designed and executed through the quilombo community. A quilombo was a settlement that was formed by fugitive slaves and free-born Africans. Quilombos came closest to the idea of recreating African societies in a new environment (namely, Brazil) and against increasingly heavy odds.  1807 In 1807, slaves were planning a revolt that would take place on May 28, during Corpus Christi celebrations. Six days before the revolt would take place they were betrayed by a slave loyal to his master. The master went to the governor and he was skeptical about the situation. However, he sent his spies out into the community and he learned that a subversive plan was real and growing stronger as the 28th approached. A day before the rebellion took place the governor had mounted specific patrols in the city. With its exits and entrances under surveillance, and rural officers on the roads, the house that was the center of the planning was surrounded and searched. After being searched the alleged leaders and captains were taken prisoner. Many weapons were confiscated from the house, such as: four hundred arrows, a bundle of rods to be used as bows, piles of rope, knives, and one shotgun. Rural officers caught three of the ringleaders who had fled earlier that afternoon, and military patrols on rounds caught a few more identified as agents or enticers. The goal of the uprising is believed to have been to capture ships in the harbor and make a massive flight back to Africa.  1814 The rebellion of 1814 overshadowed the previous ones in numbers of participants and violence. Starting on February 28, slave fishermen began to burn down part of the harbor, killing the foreman and most of his family. The rebels proceeded to head to the village of Itapoan. Resistance was met when they were trying to leave to go the next village. Troops from Salvador then encountered a bloody battle with the rebels, which left the rebels with fifty fewer men. Four of the captured slaves were hanged in public and twelve were deported to Portuguese colonies in Africa.  1835  The Muslim Slave revolt in 1835 began January 24, 1835 by rebellion organizers, Malês, or Muslim Africans. The revolt took place in the streets of Salvador and lasted for three hours. During that time seventy people were killed and a report of more than five hundred were sentenced to death, in prison, whipped or deported. Reis argues that if you bring these numbers into today’s times, with Salvador being 1.5 million, over twelve thousand people would be sentenced to some form of punishment. Within these hearings, Africans spoke out about their rebellion as well as about their cultural, social, religious and domestic lives. The testimonies from court and the oppressors’ descriptions of these Africans that were enslaved brought out “priceless testimonies” of African culture with the Americas. Families  Not only was slavery harsh but the making of families was also extreme. In 1778, José da Lisboa wrote,“ Because of the obvious benefits accruing from male labor over female, there are always three times as many males as females among the slave population, which perpetuates the pattern of their failure to propagate as well as their failure to increase in number from generation to generation”. Slave owners in Brazil viewed their slaves as replaceable and the shipment of slaves from the West Africa were insurmountable. Native born slaves populations was slightly higher women to men, 100:92, where as the Africans that were not born in Brazil were a little less 100:125, women to men. Also what was interesting was how the African men “vied” for the African woman and the formations of African families was extremely dissatisfactory and limiting even among free Blacks. In terms of the relationships in Bahia there were not a lot of married couples, “As one might expect, slaves had scant opportunities for affectionate relationships either episodic or long lasting. More than 27 percent claimed to be bachelors, and that number could be raised to 98 percent if we considered those whose marital status is not known to have been single “.

The festival features local, regional, and national bluegrass musicians.\\"Podunk Bluegrass is Back for Their 18th Year\\". Cybergrass Besides four days of music on the main stage, the festival hosts band and songwriting competitions, a kid's bluegrass academy, workshops with headlining bands, and separate picking and quiet camping areas. History The Podunk Bluegrass Festival was founded in the winter of 1995-96, by then Mayor of East Hartford, CT, Robert DeCrescenzo with assistance by recording studio owner Mike Hayden and musician/radio host Kevin Lynch. It was DeCrescenzo's vision to renovate large sections of the city and, in addition, establish an arts scene downtown. It was also his idea to make a bluegrass music festival a large part of that vision. DeCrescenzo vowed, together with Hayden and Lynch, to present a first-class bluegrass event. That summer of '96, DeCrescenzo promised to have the new downtown park built and ready to use in time for the festival. Roger Moss, then director of the Park & Rec Department, hustled to get the finishing touches completed a few weeks before the first festival on July 26–27, 1996. No small task, it involved laying sod at Martin Park where the main stage was constructed, and building a small bridge festival attendees could cross to access the park. In order to help publicize the inaugural festival, DeCrescenzo organized a breakfast in the Town Hall to promote the event on the Thursday morning before the festival gates opened in Martin Park. Some 40 people were in attendance. Town officials, potential sponsors, and invited press were treated to a live bluegrass concert by a group of local musicians. The official event kicked off on Friday, July 26, 1996 with a free bluegrass concert open to the public in the downtown park on Main Street. The lineup of artists for the first Podunk Bluegrass Music Festival included John Hartford, Mac Wiseman, Laurie Lewis, Larry Sparks & The Lonesome Ramblers, The New Coon Creek Girls, Lost & Found, plus local CT band Northern Bound. Until 2011, the festival was held in East Hartford, Connecticut; in 2012 it was moved to Norwich, Connecticut.Melissa Traynor, 'East Hartford's Podunk Bluegrass Festival Moves to Norwich', Hartford Courant, February 22, 2012.Adam Benson, 'Podunk festival regulars praise Norwich venue', NorwichBulletin.com, August 4, 2012.

The Courant, 16 April 2013 In 2014, the newly relocated festival was held the second weekend of August at the Hebron Fairgrounds in Hebron, Connecticut.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederate States of America, especially the Mississippi River, and to be employed as a gunboat when required.  Built at Cincinnati in 1862  Florence Miller (\\"tinclad\\" gunboat No. 1.), a wooden stern-wheel steamer built at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1862, was purchased by the Navy there on 11 November 1862; renamed Rattler 5 December 1862; and commissioned 19 December 1862 at Cairo, Illinois, Acting Master Amos Longthorne, in command.  Civil War service  = Assigned to the Mississippi Squadron = With Rattler in the lead, sounding as she went along, Admiral David Dixon Porter's Mississippi Squadron ascended the White and Arkansas Rivers to attack Fort Hindman at Arkansas Post on 10 January 1863, in a joint Army-Navy expedition as part of the larger campaign against Vicksburg, Mississippi. While the other gunboats bombarded Fort Hindman, Rattler closed within 50 yards of the Confederate guns in an unsuccessful effort to clear away a barrier of chevaux-de-frise and was forced by heavy fire to return to station. = Participating in the Vicksburg Campaign = Rattler during the Vicksburg Campaign The next day Rattler and dashed past the fort to enfilade the Confederate position; their guns drove the Rebel troops out of rifle pits allowing Federal troops under General William T. Sherman to reach the fort unopposed. The gunboat's cannonade forced the Rebel commander to surrender Fort Hindman and some 6,500 Confederate troops. Rattler next served as flagship of a flotilla of \\"tinclads\\" and Army transports carrying 6,000 men of General Sherman's Corps during the Yazoo Pass expedition, an abortive attempt to bypass and isolate Vicksburg by means of bayous. The expedition failed in attacks against Fort Pemberton 11–13 March at the confluence of the Yalobusha and Tallahatchie Rivers. During the action Rattler lost one man killed, and another was wounded by fire from the riverbanks. = Mississippi River operations = After the success of the campaign against Vicksburg, 4 July 1863, Porter's squadron controlled the entire Mississippi River now \\"unvexed to the sea.\\" From 12 to 20 July, Rattler joined in raids up the Red, Black, Tensas, and Ouachita Rivers. During these operations, she teamed with to capture the Rebel steamer Louisville (later ) on the Little Red River. In the late summer, Rattler patrolled the Mississippi River near Rodney, Mississippi, above Natchez, Mississippi, to intercept crossing attempts by Confederate forces, inspect river craft, and convoy supply boats, helping to seal off the South from supplies and manpower west of the mighty river. = Commanding officer captured while attending church services = On 13 September 1863, Rattler's commanding officer, Acting Master E. H. Fentress, and 16 crewmen were captured by Rebel guerrillas while attending church at Rodney. After this incident, the gunboat patrolled the river near Rodney for over a year. = Rattler sinks after striking a snag and is abandoned = On 30 December 1864, during a heavy gale near Grand Gulf, Mississippi, Rattler's anchor cable parted and she was driven ashore, struck a snag, and sank. After her supplies and most of her guns were salvaged she was abandoned. Rebel troops subsequently set Rattler afire and destroyed her.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The short was released on June 16, 1951. The voices are performed by Mel Blanc, Bea Benaderet and John T. Smith. Unlike many Warner Bros.-series cartoons featuring cats, such as Sylvester, as the antagonists of their targets (such as birds) and dogs serving to discourage their behavior, Chow Hound uses a different formula, wherein a large bulldog is the merciless bully, and a frightened cat, along with a mouse, are both his hapless victims. Plot A large bulldog bullies two unwilling parties—a frightened cat, whom the dog refers to as 'Stupid' three times in the short, and a tough-talking mouse—into various scams to obtain dinner from various residences. The bulldog forces the cat into participating as punishment for consistently coming back with stolen meat but no gravy. The scheme involves the dog, who forever complains that he is \\"starving,\\" using the cat to pose as the pet for three residents and an exhibit at a municipal zoo. The cat poses as (in order of appearance): * \\"Butch,\\" a turtleneck- wearing feline. The cat timidly walks to the waiting bulldog to hand him his steak, but the bulldog asks \\"What, no gravy?\\" and slaps the cat for forgetting the gravy. * A bow-tied \\"Harold,\\" who is scolded by his female \\"mistress\\" as he comes home. \\"Harold\\" tries to eat a leg of chicken when the mistress leaves the room, but is quickly grabbed by the bulldog, who again reprimands him for forgetting the gravy. * \\"Timothy,\\" the alley cat who serves as the mouse catcher for an older gentleman living in a brownstone apartment building. The cat swallows the mouse whole, earning more physical punishment; the mouse tries unsuccessfully to get away after he is spit out. After earning another steak from the owner, the cat is again slapped by the bulldog for forgetting the gravy again. The mouse tries to get tough, but is simply hit on the head. * As a \\"saber-tooth alley catus\\", complete with fake fangs. The zookeeper shrugs his shoulders at the apparently new, unannounced \\"exhibit.\\" It is at this point where the cat tries to one-up his captor by wrapping a TNT stick inside the steak. The result is only a small blast in the dog's stomach, which the embarrassed dog apparently misinterprets as gas and excuses himself. He smacks the cat (off-screen) for forgetting the gravy yet again. He then starts to complain that \\"week in, week out, it's the same thing; it's too slow!\\" He then sees a sign advertising a reward for lost animals and gets a sinister idea: holding the cat hostage for weeks, the dog accurately anticipates that the cat's \\"owners\\" will post rewards in the newspaper. \\"I've got plans for you!\\" the dog snarls. The bulldog reads the missing animals article in the newspaper for the addresses and reward amounts from the owners and prepares to execute his big scam (telling his cat comrade \\"C'mon stupid; this is the payoff!\\") The bulldog returns the cat to each of his masters, collects the reward and then reclaims his cat by means of a trick-bed, the largest of the rewards coming from the zoo. The dog, gloating that he is now \\"set for life\\" and will \\"never be hungry again,\\" uses his ill-gotten gains to purchase a butcher shop, where \\"acres and acres\\" of meat hang from the ceiling. The final scene takes place at a \\"dog and cat hospital\\". The bulldog's gluttony has gotten the better of him, as his overindulgence on meat has rendered him grossly obese and unable to move a muscle. After two doctors diagnose \\"a distinct case of overeating\\" and depart from the operating room, two visitors march in: the cat and the mouse. The cat—speaking for the only time in the film—menacingly says, \\"This time, we didn't forget the gravy.\\" The nervously- perspiring dog mutters \\"no\\" several times but is helpless to stop them as the mouse jams a large funnel into the dog's mouth and smiles as the cat begins force-feeding the dog from an institutional-sized canister of gravy as the picture irises out over the sound of the dog gurgling; with the cat and mouse finally getting their revenge against their canine tormentor.

It ran from 21 September 1998 to 3 June 2002, but shifted into reruns with commentary on 17 May 2002. It has made occasional returns in John Allison's website in between his other comics since 2013. Webcomics portal Keenspot kept the Bobbins archive freely accessible online, but the archives eventually moved to Allison's own site. Bobbins is set in the fictional West Yorkshire town of Tackleford, England and focused on the lives of the staff of the fictional City Limit magazine. The webcomic won a few awards, and Bobbins discontinuation in 2002 was followed by the start of Scary Go Round, which shares most of Bobbins cast. History Bobbins characters such as Shelley Winters were also the major characters of Scary Go Round. John Allison had started drawing the characters in 1994 and experimented with them in various paper-comics until mid-1998 when he submitted a sample pack of 25 strips titled Bobbins — northwestern English slang for \\"crap\\"Bobbins - Kicking it crumbly style \\\\- to King Features Syndicate and Universal Features. They later rejected the submissions. By September 1998 John was hand-drawing five strips per week and scanning them for presenting on the web, up until mid-2000 when he changed to computer drawing with Adobe Illustrator.GerdingFitzgerald In 2001, Allison started producing Bobbins with vector art, resulting in a more stiff, but visually clean look.Whitney Bobbins evolved a lot throughout its run, starting out as following longer storylines and becoming more of a day-to-day strip lateron.Withrow & Barber Allison stopped Bobbins in 2002, so he could focus on his new webcomic, titled Scary Go Round (SGR).Leaver Most of the main characters followed him, and SGR, although originally intended to be a spin- off focusing on the minor characters Tessa Davies and Rachel Dukakis- Monteforte, eventually ended up with roughly the same cast as the end of Bobbins, though a number of new characters were introduced later.Bobbins — CAST 2002, Keenspot In 2013, new installments of Bobbins began to appear on Fridays, interleaved with the Bad Machinery strip (which publishes Monday through Thursday). The new episodes were apparently taking place around 1998, \\"retconned\\" into the early Bobbins run, and prominently featured Amy, whose older version was important to the Bad Machinery storyline in progress which involved time travel and alternate realities. More new Bobbins comics have been published since, including a run beginning in December in between storylines of Bad Machinery. Some are \\"Bobbins NOW\\" strips, featuring the present-day versions of Bobbins characters. Reception Michael Whitney of The Webcomics Examiner said that, though Bobbinss suffered from Allison's lack of experience at the time, the early strips were well drawn regardless. Whitney stated that Allison incorporated his flaws into a consistent and satisfying style. Allison himself has said that Bobbins was \\"pretty rough and variable in quality,\\" but that he \\"learned [his] craft\\" drawing it.Jon As for the story, Stephen Gerding described Bobbins as similar to Friends, or Coupling with an office atmosphere. Allison noted his later episodes got very bizarre and this, beginning in 2002, led to the supernatural tone of Scary Go Round. Whitney stated that, as the plot turned to the bizarre, \\"the center was losing hold.\\" In 2002, Bobbins was nominated for the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards categories Best Use of Color, Best Site Design and Best Female Character (Shelley Winters).Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards In June the same year, Bobbins was Runner-up best online comic strip in the UK National Comic Awards.HahnSutherland Notes =References=      * External links * Classic Bobbins archive * New Bobbins archive Category:1990s webcomics Category:2000s webcomics Category:Comic strips started in the 1990s Category:British comedy webcomics Category:Fantasy webcomics Category:Keenspot Category:Concluded webcomics Category:1998 webcomic debuts ","title":"Bobbins (webcomic)"},{"id":"13899291","text":"NADPH and a small molecule inhibitor (not shown).

In 2006, its population was estimated in 33,318 inhabitants. History The history of Porto União has always been intrinsically connected with the Iguazu River and with what is considered its twin city União da Vitória. It all began in 1842 with the discovery of the 'Vau do Iguaçu' (literally meaning 'Iguazu Ford'), the best connection between the South and the Southeast Region, where the army troops and people from Rio Grande do Sul known as 'tropeiros' used to cross the river with their oxen in order to sell them in São Paulo and Minas Gerais. It was also an important stop point for those who used the river in transportation, receiving its first name: Porto da União (Harbour of Union). In a few years, the area rapidly developed. The small village grew and in 1855 its name was changed to Porto União da Vitória. In the same year, immigration began with the influx of Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Austrians and Russians. In 1901, its name again changed, this time to União da Vitória. In 1912, the Contestado War took place and in September 5, 1917 the municipality of Porto União was created. In the 1950s, both cities, União da Vitória and Porto União, reach their economic and regional importance as the result the growth of the native wood market and of yerba mate.

It dates to the 15th century. During the early 17th century, the friary served as a refuge for elderly and infirm friars and priests who were fleeing persecution in the wake of the English Reformation. The friary had fallen into ruin by the 19th century, but the Franciscans reoccupied it in 1827. They re-used the nave, south transept and tower of the original friary in the construction of a new church. The Multyfarnham Abbey is dedicated to Mary, Mother of God, whose feast is on January 1, and to Saint Francis of Assisi, who is honoured on October 4. Enter by the West Doorway, sprinkle yourself with holy water, for the ground you stand on is holy ground. The heavy, majestic doors are Irish oak, oak from the woods around Muine Bheag, Co. Carlow and the finished product is the workmanship of skilled tradesmen of Mohill Co. Leitrim. The first friars came to Multyfarnham around 1270 at the invitation of the Delamar family (soldier protectors) and is presumed that their patron would have provided them, shortly after that date, with a church and residence worthy of its piety and position. \\"Oh House of Friars, lonely dost thou stand, and few there are that cross thy threshold now, Who once had faithful friends at thy command. Why should destruction fall on such as thou?\\" . . . But the friars did return. They were hard, unsettled and dangerous times from 1613 to 1648. Friars were arrested, thrown in prison, left to die or deported to other continents. There was toleration between 1625-1641 when the clergy and Catholic nobility met there and had vigorous Franciscan activity. And the temple was reconstructed in 1827. \\"To the Almighty and Powerful God. In honour and under the patronage of the holy Virgin Mother Mary and St. Francis.

It is the only university in Central Oregon that offers both baccalaureate and graduate programs. OSU- Cascades also offers professional pathways and certificate programs. The 10-acre campus is the first public university to open in Oregon in more than 50 years. The campus plans to expand academically with new degree programs over a 10-year period. History In August 2012, the Oregon State Board of Higher Education approved OSU's plan to expand the campus into a four-year school. Oregon State University planned to add freshman and sophomore level classes to the Cascades campus as early as 2015, though it was not decided if the current location would be used or if a new campus would be built. During the 2013 legislative session, the Oregon Legislative Assembly approved $16 million in construction bonds to finance a new, expanded four-year campus in Bend for OSU-Cascades. A supplement of $8 million in philanthropic funds and campus-supported bonds would create a financing package totaling $24 million. A suitable building site would require 40 to 60 acres. Academics OSU- Cascades currently offers 16 undergraduate degree programs , with plans to launch a Bachelor of Science in Nursing during the 2019-20 academic year. The program will be available online. The university hopes to support registered nurses who want to advance their careers by completing a part-time Bachelor of Science program. Designed as a 2-year program, the curriculum encourages nurses to continue working while enrolled. Student enrollment as of the 2017 fall term was 1,204, which the university is working to increase to 5,000 by the year 2025. OSU-Cascades partners with the Central Oregon Community College and Oregon State University. Students can take lower-division classes at the Central Oregon Community College and upper-division classes through OSU- Cascades or Oregon State University. Additionally, OSU-Cascades serves students with small class sizes and one-on-one mentoring. =Graduate programs= Masters programs are currently available in Counseling, Teaching, and Creative Writing. Campus Tykeson hall The campus, which opened in 2001 and operated in Cascades Hall at Central Oregon Community College, began offering four-year degrees by Fall 2015. The campus is currently seated on of land, with four buildings on it (one of which is operated by the Bend Science Station). A fifth building, the Graduate and Research Center (GRC), is located a half-mile away near Deschutes Brewery. The GRC houses faculty offices and classrooms utilized by all Cascades students. Tykeson Hall, named for businessman and philanthropist Don Tykeson, was opened in Fall 2016, and contains the majority of classrooms on campus. The building also houses faculty offices, administrative offices, and labs. The Cascades Student Residence (CSR), which can house up to 304 students, is the university's only residence hall. The campus dining and academic building, Obsidian Hall, can hold up to 250 students. Both buildings were opened in January 2017. Student demographics For the Fall 2017 term, the first year of enrollment at the new campus (which features campus housing), had an enrollment of 1,204 students. Out of those students, there were 81 first-year students, 158 transfer students, and 249 graduate students. The majority of students are Oregon residents, making up 92 percent of the population with 67 percent of those students coming from Central Oregon. Eight percent of the students come from out-of-state with 28 of those students coming from seven countries. In Fall 2017, about 25 percent of all OSU-Cascades students were the first in their families to attend college. Only eleven percent of OSU-Cascades students are under age 20. The average age of all OSU-Cascades students is 29 and the average age of graduate students is 33. Seven percent of students identified as Hispanic and six percent identified as two other United States minorities. Future expansion In early 2018, the Oregon Legislature approved a $39 million state-backed bond to expand the OSU-Cascades campus. Supported by Governor Kate Brown, the expansion will go towards the construction of a new academic building, focused on STEAM fields. The building will feature labs, classrooms, and faculty offices. Majors such as kinesiology, engineering, art, and outdoor products will be housed within the new building. Construction is projected to begin in Summer 2019 with the facility scheduled to open in Fall 2021. OSU-Cascades purchased a 73 acre demolition landfill from Deschutes County for $1 in late 2017. The landfill sits adjacent to the Cascades campus, and was previously used to collect construction debris. The expected cost of the site cleanup is $43.3 million. The university also owns another 46 acres from an old pumice mine, located next to the landfill. With over 100 acres purchased, OSU Cascades plans to expand their 10 acre campus. This expansion is projected to serve upwards of 5,000 students within the next decade. \\"We want to help ensure that the region has a balanced economy that's not just based on timber and tourism,\\" said Kelly Sparks, Associate Vice President of Finance and Strategic Planning at OSU-Cascades. Sparks projects the expansion of the campus will fulfill the need of skilled jobs in the Central Oregon area. Skills in brewing, aviation, and the tech industry are in need in Bend and the surrounding regions. The OSU-Cascade campus hopes to create a zero- waste sustainable campus by featuring \\"net-zero energy, water, and waste campuses\\". Student life Mt. Bachelor Bend is Central Oregon’s largest city and the seventh largest in the state. Bend lies between the Cascade Mountains and the Central Oregon high desert plateaus. The city, which started out as a lumber town when it was established in 1905, has become a tourist hub for outdoor recreation enthusiasts and beer-lovers alike, with dozens of hiking/biking trails and breweries. Mt. Bachelor ski resort is also a popular tourist destination, and just 30 minutes from the cascades campus, providing students with easy access to the mountain. The Oregon State Cascades Campus is located a short drive away from Mt. Bachelor, the Factory Outlets, and the Les Schwab Amphitheater. For students who are confined to campus, OSU Cascades offers over 20 student organizations and clubs that range from athletics to academics. Because of the location of the school, near Mt. Bachelor and the Three Sisters Wilderness, many clubs focus on outdoor activities provided by these locations.

It is operated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). It takes its name from the original Lotto America, offered from 1988 to 1992. Lotto America was re-launched by 13 state lotteries on November 12, 2017, as a replacement for the scandal-tarred Hot Lotto game; each of the 13 members of Lotto America offered Hot Lotto when it ended on October 28, 2017. Original Lotto America (1988–1992) The original version of Lotto America (stylized as Lotto*America) was a $1-per-play, pick-7-of-40 game, rather than the pick-6 games that had become wildly popular in U.S. lotteries. Matching four numbers won a fixed prize of $5; matching at least five won a parimutuel prize. Matching all seven won the jackpot, whose odds were roughly 1 in 18 million, at the time the longest odds of a U.S. lottery game. The top prize was a 20-year annuity; there was never a cash option, even though a few games did offer one when LA ended. During the middle of its four-year run, LA became a more traditional pick-6-of-54 game; unlike the first version, players got two games for $1. The jackpot odds actually became more favorable at 1 in 13 million per dollar; however, overall odds were much tougher, since four numbers were still needed to win the lowest prize tier. This version was entirely parimutuel. In some of its jurisdictions, LA was known by a different, \\"more local\\" name. For instance, in Minnesota, LA was called Lotto Minnesota. Several states joined MUSL during the era of LA. One of them, Maine, decided to leave MUSL when LA ended; Maine did not rejoin MUSL until 2004. MUSL's rapidly growing population base resulted in the replacement of Lotto America in April 1992 with Powerball. =Original members (1988–1992)= *Delaware (January 1991) *District of Columbia § *Idaho (February 1990) *Indiana (October 1990) *Iowa § *Kansas § *Kentucky (January 1991) *Maine (July 1990) *Minnesota (August 1990) *Missouri § *Montana (November 1989) *Oregon § *Rhode Island § *South Dakota (November 1990) *West Virginia § *Wisconsin (August 1989) § The seven founding members of MUSL, which composed the original lineup for Lotto America. The game began in 1988; dates when other lotteries joined are shown in parentheses. Except for Maine, the above lotteries were the original lineup for Powerball when it began in April 1992. 2017 revival Due to falling sales of Hot Lotto in the wake of the Hot Lotto fraud scandal, the game was discontinued and the final drawing was held on October 28, 2017. As a replacement, a new version of Lotto America became available on November 12, 2017; its first drawing was November 15, 2017. Lotto America is available wherever Hot Lotto was offered at the time of its final drawing, except New Hampshire. Lotto America is drawn on Wednesday and Saturday nights after 11 p.m. ET/10 p.m. CT. For each $1 play, bettors choose five numbers from 1 through 52, and a \\"star ball\\" numbered from 1 through 10, or ask for terminal-generated numbers. For an additional $1 per play, the bettor can add the \\"All-Star Bonus\\" option, which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The minimum Lotto America jackpot is $2 million; however, the game's initial jackpot was $15 million; the 13 members chose to augment the jackpot with funds from Hot Lotto, whose final jackpot was not won. While Hot Lotto used a random number generator during most of its run (including the December 2010 drawing whose jackpot was \\"won\\" by Eddie Tipton, a MUSL employee), Lotto America is believed to be drawn in Tallahassee, Florida (even though the Florida Lottery does not offer the game), using physical ball machines and numbered balls; one machine draws the five main numbers while another is used to draw the \\"Star Ball\\". As of December 2018, none of the actual drawings have been made available to the viewing public; a computer-generated display of the drawings is shown on an unofficial website. =Members= *Delaware *Idaho *Iowa *Kansas *Maine *Minnesota *Montana *New Mexico *North Dakota *Oklahoma *South Dakota *Tennessee *West Virginia Note: these 13 members were among Hot Lotto's membership when it ended on October 28, 2017.

Pre–Civil War =Early detective work: 1856-1861= Very little is known about Kate Warne prior to her working for Allan Pinkerton, except that she was born in Erin, Chemung County, New York and was a widow by age 23. Pinkerton, in his book The Spy of the Rebellion (1883), described her as: > [a] commanding person, with clear cut, expressive features ... a slender, > brown-haired woman, graceful in her movements and self-possessed. Her > features, although not what could be called handsome [beautiful], were > decidedly of an intellectual cast ... her face was honest, which would cause > one in distress instinctly [sic] to select her as a confidante. Warne walked into the Pinkerton Detective Agency in response to an advertisement in a local newspaper. When she walked into Pinkerton's Chicago office, according to Pinkerton company records, he further described her acquaintance: > [he] was surprised to learn Kate was not looking for clerical work, but was > actually answering an advertisement for detectives he had placed in a > Chicago newspaper. At the time, such a concept was almost unheard of. > Pinkerton said \\"It is not the custom to employ women detectives!\\" Kate > argued her point of view eloquently - pointing out that women could be \\"most > useful in worming out secrets in many places which would be impossible for a > male detective.\\" A Woman would be able to befriend the wives and girlfriends > of suspected criminals and gain their confidence. Men become braggarts when > they are around women who encourage them to boast. Kate also noted, Women > have an eye for detail and are excellent observers. Warne's arguments swayed Pinkerton, who employed Warne as the first female detective. Pinkerton soon had a chance to put Warne to the test. In 1858, Warne was involved in the case of Adams Express Company embezzlements, where she was successfully able to bring herself into the confidence of the wife of the prime suspect, Mr. Maroney. She thereby acquired valuable evidence leading to the husband's conviction. Mr. Maroney was an expressman living in Montgomery, Alabama. The Maroneys stole $50,000 from the Adams Express Company. With Warne's help, $39,515 was returned. Mr. Maroney was convicted and sentenced to ten years in Montgomery, Alabama. In 1860, Allan Pinkerton put Warne in charge of his new Female Detective Bureau. The Baltimore Plot In 1861, Allan Pinkerton was hired by Samuel H. Felton, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, to investigate secessionist activity and threats of damage to the railroad in Maryland. Pinkerton went to work placing agents at various points in Maryland to investigate this potential activity. As the investigation proceeded, Pinkerton became aware that the activity in Maryland did not just end with the railroad: it also included the president-elect, Abraham Lincoln. Pinkerton received permission to continue his investigation and focus on the possible assassination plot. Warne was one of five agents sent to Baltimore, Maryland, on February 3, 1861, to investigate the hotbed of secessionist activity. During the investigation, evidence unveiled a plot to assassinate Lincoln on his way to take office. Under the aliases Mrs. Cherry and Mrs. M. Barley (M.B.), Warne tracked suspicious movement among the Baltimore secessionists. It was in part through her undercover work in the guise of: > [A] rich southern lady visiting Baltimore with a thick southern accent that > apparently Mrs. Warne infiltrated secessionist social gatherings, in the > Baltimore area, places such as the classy Barnum Hotel (Barnum's City > Hotel), posing as a flirting \\"Southern belle\\" and was quick to not only > verify that there was a plot to assassinate Lincoln, she developed details > of how the assassination was going to occur. Pinkerton had agents across Maryland, but it was Warne specifically who supplied many of the key details that led Pinkerton to believe that the plot was imminent. Warne had befriended secessionists in Maryland and collected many details about the plot to assassinate Lincoln. The president-elect, Abraham Lincoln, was traveling from his home in Springfield, Illinois, to the Capital via a train tour that was to stop at notable cities along the way. His published program showed that Lincoln's last leg of the journey was from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C. Due to the configuration of the rail system, all southbound trains required a transfer to be made in Baltimore, Maryland. The northbound station ended at Calvert Street and the southbound train station started at Camden Street (now the Camden Yards station). The distance between these two stations were about a mile by carriage ride. The secessionist plot to kill Lincoln was: > just as Mr. Lincoln would be passing through the narrow vestibule of the > Depot at Calvert St. Station, to enter his carriage. A row or fight was to > be got up by some outsiders to quell which the few policemen at the Depot > would rush out, thus leaving Mr. Lincoln entirely unprotected and at the > mercy of a mob of Secessionists who were to surround him at that time. A > small Steamer had been chartered and was lying in one of the Bays or little > streams running into the Chesapeake Bay, to which the murderers were to flee > and it was immediately to put off for Virginia. After seeing the pieces of the plot coming together, Pinkerton directed Kate Warne on to take the 5:10 evening train to New York City on the morning of February 18. Once there, she was to set up a meeting with Norman B. Judd and give him a letter from Pinkerton outlining the known details of the assassination attempt. After receiving the details of the Baltimore Plot from Warne, Judd set up a meeting between himself, Pinkerton, and Lincoln on February 21. At this meeting, Lincoln was doubtful of the existence of an assassination plot or that if such a plot existed that it should be taken seriously. However, a second independent source confirmed the plot by way of Frederick W. Seward, son of William H. Seward (the secretary of state–designate). From this point, Lincoln agreed that the assassination plot was plausible enough to take action. Lincoln decided to avoid hazard where it was not necessary; however, he refused to cancel any of his scheduled plans in Harrisburg. His agenda included: giving three speeches, raising of the American flag at Independence Hall, and attending a high-profile dinner. Train arrangements were made accordingly that allowed Lincoln to fulfill his scheduled duties in Harrisburg. It was not until 5:45 at night that there was any deviation from his schedule. John George Nicolay, Lincoln's private secretary, interrupted the dinner party to excuse the president-elect. Lincoln then changed into a traveling suit and a soft felt cap. He carried a shawl upon one arm to play the role of an invalid. Pinkerton, meanwhile, had the telegraph lines interrupted to prevent any knowledge of the deviation in Lincoln's schedule. At the station, Warne entered the sleeping car through the rear along with Pinkerton, Ward Hill Lamon, and a still-disguised Lincoln. She greeted Lincoln loudly as she would have a true brother. From Harrisburg, Abraham Lincoln rode to Philadelphia by a special Pennsylvania Railroad train. From Philadelphia he went to Baltimore by a special Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore train on the night of February 22–23. It is said that Kate Warne did not sleep a wink on the overnight trip from Pennsylvania to Washington D.C. The disguises provided by Warne that night enabled Lincoln to make it through Baltimore without recognition and take his seat in the White House. It is believed that Pinkerton came up with the slogan to his agency \\"we never sleep\\" as a result of Warne's guard of Lincoln that night. Warne was key in the foiled Baltimore assassination plot – not only did she help uncover its details, but she also carried out most of the arrangements to smuggle Lincoln into Washington, D.C. She couriered secret information and set up meetings as well as securing the necessary four berths on a train leaving Philadelphia under the pretext that these berths were for her sick brother and family members. The train pulled out shortly before 11 p.m. and arrived in Baltimore about 3:30 a.m. on February 23. Warne remained in Baltimore as the sleeping cars with Lincoln on board were shifted to another train, which arrived in Washington around 6 a.m. Civil War: Intelligence work for the Union, 1861–1865 During the American Civil War Kate Warne traveled with her boss, Allan Pinkerton, to meet with General George B. McClellan's Ohio Division. This photo shows Pinkerton and President Lincoln at the Battle of Antietam in 1862. During the American Civil War, Allan Pinkerton and Kate Warne were used as a covert war intelligence-gathering bureau. Warne could easily penetrate into Southern social gatherings. She said that women are most useful in worming out secrets in many places which would be impossible for a male detective. Believed to be a mistress of Pinkerton, Warne would often pose as his wife while undercover. She also had an assortment of alias names: Kay Warne, Kay Waren, Kay Warren, Kate Warne, Kate Waren, Kate Warren, Kitty Warne, Kitty Waren, Kitty Warren, Kittie Waren, Kittie Warne, and Kittie Warren. Warne was known as \\"Kitty\\" to Robert Pinkerton, Allan's brother. Robert Pinkerton often argued with Warne over expenses turned over to the agency, but her relationship with Allan continued for years. After the quelled assassination attempt on president-elect Abraham Lincoln, Kate Warne continued to travel with Allan Pinkerton as his Female Superintendent of Detectives. On April 12, 1861, the Confederate States of America's cannons in Charleston began firing on Fort Sumter. These cannon shells marked the beginning of the American Civil War. Within nine days, Pinkerton wrote to President Lincoln offering the services of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. However, before Lincoln could respond, Major General George B. McClellan asked Pinkerton to set up a military intelligence service for McClellan's command. Therefore, by the end of July 1861, Pinkerton took Warne, Timothy Webster, and later George Bangs west to set up a headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, to follow McClellan's Ohio division (see also Cincinnati in the Civil War). Post-Civil War: Continued espionage, 1865–1867 After the Civil War, Kate Warne worked on various high-profile cases. One of these involved the murder of a bank-teller, George Gordon. The murderer got away with $130,000. Pinkerton determined that Gordon was fetching money for a friend or someone who frequented the bank when he was struck on the head behind the ear with a hammer with intent to murder any witnesses of the robbery.The Detective and the Somnambulist: The Murderer and the Fortune Teller, p. 39 Through his investigation, Pinkerton felt certain that his prime suspect, Alexander P. Drysdale, had in fact killed Gordon. However, at this point he did not have enough hard evidence to convict Drysdale; too much was still based on speculation. Therefore, he set a trap for Drysdale so that he would reveal a confession. Warne was sent under cover as a Mrs. Potter and became close friends with Mr. Drysdale's wife. Through this plot, they were able to uncover where Drysdale had hidden the stolen money. Another case for which Kate Warne went undercover was brought about by a Captain Sumner, who was convinced that both his sister, Mrs. Annie Thayer, and a Mr. Pattmore, were attempting to poison Mrs. Pattmore and himself. Warne took the name Lucille and assumed the role of a fortune teller to lure information out of the suspected murderer's confidants.The Detective and the Somnambulist: The Murderer and the Fortune Teller, p. 192 In the meantime, she also continually coordinated Pinkerton's other female detectives in the agency. Pinkerton rented a space for Warne to work as part of her guise. Allan Pinkerton named Kate Warne one of the five best detectives that he had. Her employment by Pinkerton was a significant moment in Woman's History. Women were not allowed to be a part of the police force until 1891 and could not be officers until 1910. Pinkerton specifically thanked Kate Warne and Timothy Webster in his memoirs. Both Warne and Webster were key operatives during the Baltimore Plot investigations. Warne reported back to Pinkerton about all her work when he was away from the office and they worked together, on numerous cases, during their tenure. Pinkerton constantly showed a deep trust in the work that Warne performed and acknowledges so in his memoirs. She was in charge of the Female Detective Bureau established by Pinkerton, her title being Supervisor of Women Agents. Pinkerton said to his female prospective agents: > In my service you will serve your country better than on the field. I have > several female operatives. If you agree to come aboard you will go in > training with the head of my female detectives, Kate Warne. She has never > let me down. Burial Warne was buried in the Pinkerton Family Plot at Graceland Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois. Her gravestone is marked under the misspelled surname of \\"Warn\\", and states that she died of \\"congestion of the lungs.\\" Pinkerton wanted her burial plot to be undisturbed, so he took care of the issue in his will. Warne's burial plot could never be sold. In popular culture Kate was depicted as a young detective in the Canadian TV series The Pinkertons, played by Martha MacIsaac. She was also portrayed in the 2020 Wild West Stunt Show at the High Chaparral Theme Park in Sweden. She is portrayed by Ronja Kruus, a Swedish painter and actress. There was a reference to her in Archer season 7 episode 5 ”Bel Panto\\" part one when Cheryl Tunt responds to the question to Pam Poovey of where the person they were supposed to be guarding was, which Pam responded \\"how the hell am I supposed to know?\\" To which Cheryl responds ”yeah, who is she? Kate Warne?\\". In episode 21 of Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum they visit her in 1840 and meet her brother Tommy.

It grows from 33 to 43° south latitude. The northern extent of this tree's range in Chile is considered to be the Vizcachas Mountains and La Campana National Park.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Chilean Wine Palm: Jubaea chilensis, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg N. obliqua was proposed to be renamed Lophozonia obliqua in 2013. Description Nothofagus obliqua.jpgL. obliqua Nothofagus obliqua Shoot LeavesCupules.jpgA shoot from an obliqua, with leaves and cupules Nothofagus obliqua reaches a height of 50 meters (175 ft). and 2 m (6.5 ft) diameter. The trunk has greyish-brown to dark brown bark and is often forked. The leaves are alternate and somewhat curled between the veins and the serrated margin. The trees bear separate male and female flowers, both of which are small, surrounded by green bracts, and rather inconspicuous. In Chile, young specimens ( which have soft, yellowish wood ) are known as roble hualle, while old trees, which have developed the reddish heartwood characteristic of mature specimens are known as roble pellín. The tree has a good shape and its timber is valued for its durability, being used for furniture-making and in construction. Cultivation The tree was introduced to the British Isles in 1849.Henry John Elwes, F.R.S. and Augustine Henry. M.A. Trees of Great Britain and Ireland. MCMVII. Volume III. Edinburgh Material with provenance from different places in its natural environment was tested in cultivation in Scotland. Trees cultivated from material collected from Ñuble, which is the provenance closest to the Equator, were the most damaged by frosts. Unfortunately seeds of that provenance were supplied to many commercial growers in the 1970s in the United Kingdom. Seeds sourced from Neuquen in Argentina proved the hardiest. A selection from Malleco, Chile, which is the provenance of the first trees planted in the British Isles also gave good hardiness results.M. B. Murray, M. G. R. Cannell, L. J. Sheppard and R.

Within one year, the hotel had prospered and surged in popularity such that the brothers established another hotel, the Oriental Hotel, in 1885, leading to a merger of both hotels into the Eastern & Oriental Hotel in 1889. The success of the brand led the brothers to establish sister hotels, the Raffles Hotel in Singapore in 1887 and the Strand Hotel in Rangoon, Burma, in 1901. Under the management of the brothers the E & O hotel would receive several major expansion works, culminating to the completion of the present hotel complex in 1929. Having failed to adapt to competition following World War II, the hotel underwent several decades of decline, and in 1996 a decision was made by the management to temporarily close down the hotel for major reconstruction. Although the front wing of the hotel, which would later be known as the \\"Heritage Wing\\", received restoration work, the rest of the hotel, including the easternmost 1929 \\"New Wing\\", was either gutted and refurbished or completely reconstructed in the style of the hotel's older architectural design; the mid-century E&O; shopping annexe, which occupied the site of the original 1884 Eastern Hotel building, was also completely leveled for the new central wing of the hotel, which prominently features faux-cast iron-framed verandahs similar in style to those at the Raffles Hotel.

On Easter Sunday 1939, contralto Marian Anderson famously performed on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial after the Daughters of the American Revolution barred her from singing at Constitution Hall due to the color of her skin. Marian Anderson, who was born in 1897, was described as having \\"a voice heard once in a hundred years.\\" Yet in 1939, she was denied the right to perform in Washington, DC's Constitution Hall due to the color of her skin. Through the efforts of Anderson, the NAACP, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, arrangements were made to hold the concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. On April 12, 2009, seventy years after Anderson set the stage for the modern civil rights era, acclaimed mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves performed at the Lincoln Memorial in a joyous Easter Sunday Concert paying tribute to Marian Anderson's performance. Graves was joined by the internationally renowned a capella ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock and the world-famous Chicago Children's Choir. Founded in 1956 at the First Unitarian Church in Chicago, by the late Rev. Christopher Moore. Sponsored by the McCormick Foundation and others, the tribute also featured a naturalization ceremony of 191 new American citizens representing 56 countries. Gen. Colin Powell, the son of two Jamaican immigrants, delivered the keynote address. The picturesque day concluded with the U.S. Marine Band performing John Philip Sousa's \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\\" =May 30, 2009= On May 30, 1922 President Warren G. Harding commemorated the life of President Lincoln with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial. Exactly four score and seven years later the ALBC, National Park Service, Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Military District of Washington, presented a Rededication Retrospective. The program, at the Lincoln Memorial, featured special guest speakers that delivered remarks about how Abraham Lincoln and the Lincoln Memorial remained entwined as beacons of freedom. The program also featured performances by the United States Marine Band and by William Farley, winner of Poetry Out Loud, who read Poet and well-known Abraham Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg's The People, Yes. Speakers and performers included: *Gordon R. Bury, 100th Commander-in-Chief of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War *William Farley, 2009 Poetry Out Loud National Champion *Reverend Dr. Roger J. Gench, Senior pastor at New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C. *Harold Holzer, ALBC Commissioner *Peggy O'Dell, Regional Director for the National Capitol *Dr. Benjamin Franklin Payton, President of Tuskegee University *Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Quintana, Acting Deputy Director of the National Park Service *Secretary Ken Salazar, Department of the Interior *United States Marine Band National Town Hall Meetings On July 22, 2008 over 30 leaders from the fields of government, non-profit, civics, journalism, arts, humanities and education, met with the ALBC to discuss a series of National Town Halls.

The Global Lincoln Oxford University was the site of a global conference discussing Lincoln's international significance and appeal. Scholars from around the world gathered at St. Catherine's College on July 3–5, 2009. The conference, titled Global Lincoln: An International Conference, focused on four subjects: *Lincoln, the United States and the World *Lincoln the Emancipator and Liberator *Lincoln the Nationalist Unifier and Modernizer *Lincoln the Progressive and Democrat Professor Richard Carwardine moderated the conference. =Lincoln, the United States and the World= Contributions by Professor Carwardine, Dr. Jay Sexton of Oxford, Odd Arne Westad of London School of Economics and Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer explored Lincoln's understanding of the globe and US role in foreign affairs. Dr. Sexton considered the ways in which American educators and statesmen attempted to project an image of the Lincoln across the globe, particularly during the Cold War and when formulating and articulating American foreign policy. Dr. Westad expanded on the Cold War and explored the ways in which peoples and states conceived of Lincoln and used his image for their own purposes. Finally, ALBC Commissioner Harold Holzer examined prints and statues of Lincoln's image across the world. =Lincoln the Emancipator and Liberator= Part two of the conference focused on Lincoln's international view as an emancipator and liberator. Professor Norman Saul of Kansas State delivered a Russian perspective of Lincoln and the president's image in the context of Russia's revolutionary changes during the birth of the soviet era. The discussion continued with a Latin America perspective from Professor Nicola Miller of the University College of London. Professor Miller examined how Lincoln served as a powerful symbol in Brazil and Cuba during those country's emancipation. Finally, historian David Blight of Yale University revisited the perceptions of southerners during Lincoln's era. Initially, many feared him as the embodiment of 'Black Republicanism' but after the war these same southerners came to recognize him as the charitable alternative to the regime of radical Republicans during Reconstruction. =Lincoln the Nationalist Unifier and Modernizer= Part three focused on the time period between 1865 and 1945. Professor Eugenio Biagini of the University of Cambridge examined the perceptions of Lincoln in Germany and Italy as they underwent parallel processes of unification and economic growth. Other discussion topics included Lincoln's influence in East Asia, India, South Africa and during the Spanish Civil War with the \\"Lincoln Brigades.\\" =Lincoln the Progressive and Democrat= Plans to explore Lincoln's legacy and reputation throughout Great Britain and Ireland. Adam I.P. Smith, University College London, discussed Lincoln's legacy as it relates to Scotland and England. A Wales perspective came from Kenneth O. Morgan of University of Oxford. Professor Morgan addressed Lincoln's reputation and influence in Wales during the later 19th and early 20th centuries. Professor Kevin Kenny of Boston College discussed Lincoln's relationship with Ireland. Professor Kenny broadened the discussion to include the Irish in America. The main focus was Lincoln's image in debates regarding Irish nationalism and Ireland's place in the Union.

The film plot involves Ilias (Andrea Occhipinti) a young man who battles monsters and mutants on his journey to manhood. Conquest was reviewed by both AllMovie and the Monthly Film Bulletin, who noted the films low budget and derivative nature, while finding the film to be surprisingly entertaining despite its negative aspects.  Plot  In a mystical land, a handsome youth named Ilias (Andrea Occhipinti) embarks on a quest, leaving behind his family in his paradise home for a fog-shrouded wilderness. From his father he receives a magic bow to mark his passage into manhood. He enters a strange land where small tribes are terrorized by werewolf-like creatures, acting under orders of Ocron (Sabrina Siani), a nude masked female of great evil. While in a drugged state, Ocron sees a faceless youth with a magic bow who dares to attack her. Ocron sends her werewolf servants out to look for the youth. A little later, a gang of Ocron's marauders try to steal the bow and capture Ilias. But they are foiled when a rugged man dressed in animal skins leaps to his rescue, beating up the marauders and forcing them to flee. The man introduces himself as Mace (Jorge Rivero), a nomadic outlaw. After admiring the younger man's magic bow, Mace teams up with him on his quest to rid the land of evil. He affects a dismissal of human affairs, but soon the two are fast friends. Mace reveals that he has contempt for people, but cares for animals and has a bond with many species. Next, Ocron sends Fado, the leader of her brutal werewolves, to capture Ilias and the magic bow. Ilias and Mace stop for the night to rest and eat with a small tribe that live in caves, and offering the people a fresh animal kill as a gift. Ilias recognizes a young girl of the tribe seen earlier in the journey, and the two of them go off together. Suddenly, masked attackers kill the girl and abduct Ilias, stealing his bow. Mace tracks them down to a camp and in a long and bloody fight, rescues his young friend. Back at Ocron's lair, Fado is burned on a giant hot-plate as punishment for his failure to capture the magic bow. Ocron summons the Great Zora (Conrado San Martin), a spirit who resides in the body of a white wolf. She offers herself, body and soul, to Zora if he can kill Ilias. Having found out the identity of the person responsible for all this, Ilias declares that he will punish Ocron for her evil crimes over the land and exhorts Mace to join him. Mace refuses, saying that he and Ocron stay clear of each other for she is too powerful to combat. Mace agrees to escort Ilias as far as the seashore, from where he must sail to Ocron's fortress. On the way, the two of them are assailed by hundreds of tiny arrows. Ilias is hit in the arm with one arrow, and soon breaks out in hideous boils. Mace sails with him along the coast to a place where a special plant grows that will cure his affliction from the poisoned arrow. Leaving his friend on the boat, Mace jumps ashore and soon does battle with grotesque zombies, and afterwards, does battle with a double of himself. Mace wins the fight and his double is revealed as Zora, who disappears after reverting to his humanoid form. The special plant works and Ilias is restored to health. But Ilias has become disenchanted and decides to sail for home, pleading with Mace go with him. Mace refuses and also refuses to take ownership of the magic bow. No sooner they have parted when Mace is attacked by a band of strange, cobweb-covered creatures. They tie him to a wooden cross and interrogate him about the whereabouts of Ilias. Mace refuses to cooperate. Ilias appears and saves Mace from the creatures with his magic bow and arrows. But the captive Mace falls off a cliff and into the sea during the rescue. Super-intelligent dolphins bite at the ropes that tie Mace to the cross and he is washed ashore, barely conscious. Ilias arrives and tells Mace that he has had a change of heart and decided to return to be with his friend and defeat Orcon. That night, Ilias is grabbed and sucked down into a lair inhabited by subterranean monsters. When Mace follows, he is forced to battle a few of them while chasing after Ilias. Venturing further into the caves, Mace finds Ilias, hanging upside down with his head cut off. Zora delivers the severed head of Ilias to Ocron as well as the magic bow. Mace lights a funeral pyre for his dead friend. Ilias' spirit speaks to Mace inside his mind and tells him to anoint himself with the ashes. This will pass along the power Cronos gave to Ilias and the magic bow will be Mace's. The next morning, Mace confronts Ocron in her lair and the bow suddenly flies out of her hands, and into his. He takes on all of Ocron's surviving werewolves, shooting them with his magic arrows from the bow. Mace fires a magic arrow at Ocron which penetrates her mask, revealing the hideously ugly face of a ghoul atop her smooth, nubile body. As Ocron dies, her dead body transforms into a wolf, which runs off into the wilderness with the white wolf Zora. The final scene has Mace, alone once again, walking into the wilderness to continue Ilias's quest to rid the land of evil. Cast *Andrea Occhipinti as Ilias *Jorge Rivero as Mace *Conrado San Martín as Zora *Sabrina Siani as Ocron * José Gras Palau as Fado *Violeta Cela as a sacrificial victim * Gioia Maria Scola Production The film's original Italian shooting title was Mace, il fuorilegge (). The film was an Italian-Spanish-Mexican co-production filmed in Mexico, Sardinia and Rome, Italy Fulci had signed a two-picture contract with the producer, Giovanni Di Clemente, but after the two had some disagreements during the making of Conquest, Fulci left immediately after shooting the film and refused to complete the contract. Di Clemente sued Fulci in court but lost, the judge opining that Fulci could not be compelled to work. Release Conquest was released on June 2, 1983 in Italy (running 80 minutes), and on August 19, 1983 in Spain under the title La conquista de la tierra perdida. It was later shown in Mexico on August 15, 1985. Italian film historian Roberto Curti described the film as a box office bomb in Italy where it grossed less than 100 million Italian lire. Conquest was later released theatrically in the United States in April 1984 with a 89 minute running time, and in the United Kingdom in May 1984 with a running time of 84 minutes.  Reception  In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin referred to the film as a \\"low-budget, deliriously magpie mix of Conan the Barbarian, Quest for Fire and Raiders of the Lost Ark with a few zombies-Fulci's Forte-thrown in for good measure.\\" The review stated that despite \\"excessive gore\\", \\"manifestly implausible plot\\" and \\"patchy special effects\\", that the film was \\"actually very enjoyable\\". The review also commented on Claudio Simonetti's score, finding it \\"wonderfully inappropriate\\" and reminiscent of Simonetti's work in Goblin and on the scores for Deep Red and Dawn of the Dead. Jeremy Wheeler (AllMovie) gave the film two stars out of five, while noting that \\"even with the shoddy production values and downright embarrassing monster masks, it is what it is  a psychedelic C-Grade fantasy flick by the master of Italian gore done in an incredibly strange time and place in movie history  Italy in the early '80s. Some might call in junk, but those with their tongue planted firmly in cheek will call it a schlock masterpiece.\\". In his analysis of the film, Louis Paul described the film as \\"far better than similar Italian sword-and-sorcery contrivances of the time.\\" While criticizing part of the dialogue, he particularly praised the cinematography and the performance of the main actor Jorge Rivero.

The band's style has been described as a hybrid of proto-punk and psychedelia and they form a \\"Rust-belt punk\\" style, along with The Stooges, MC5 and Alice Cooper.

Jack and Jason Schneider, Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995. ECW Press. . By October 1973, the band contracted into a four-piece. DeMarchant left the band in 1975, and was replaced by Tony Cutaia, who in turn left in 1976 and was replaced by Don Cramer. Romany left the band in 1976, and was replaced by Steve Park of Teenage Head. In its lifetime, the band only released one 7\\" single, \\"She's a Dog/I Can Change My Mind\\" in 1978 on fanzine magnate Gary Pig Gold's Pig Label, before breaking up in July 1979. Following the band's breakup, Breau continued as a solo artist, while other band members went on to form The Other One. Breau later ran as a candidate for the Family Coalition Party of Ontario in the 1999 provincial election. An abortive recording session with producers Daniel Lanois and Bob Lanois from 1974 and a June 28, 1975 concert performance on the roof of Jackson Square were later compiled for the 1989 album Cyborgs Revisited. Cyborgs quickly came to be regarded as a lost classic of Canadian music, being named one of the greatest Canadian albums of all time by the magazines Chart, Forced Exposure, Pop Matters and Alternative Press, as well as appearing as the 36th best Canadian album in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.\\"Neil Young, Joni Mitchell top best 100 Canadian albums\\". Canwest News Service, October 18, 2007. The need to capture the band's unconventional sonics has also been credited as one of the first catalysts for the development of Daniel Lanois' distinctive production style, which would eventually make him one of the most influential record producers in the world. Cyborgs was subsequently reissued on Sonic Unyon in 2003, with several bonus tracks including the 1978 single. Breau and Christoff reunited for a show at Hamilton's Corktown Tavern on September 17, 2006, with Steve \\"Sparky\\" Park and Joe Csontos on drums. Park works in Montreal, and could not commit to a full-blown reunion, so new members Stephen Foster on guitar and Dan Wintermans on guitar, keyboard and theremin, were brought in. The group released a new album, Half Human, Half Live, in April 2008. After a short tour of the U.S.A, which included a June 15 appearance at Terrastock, drummer Csontos left the line-up, followed by Dan Winterman and original bassist Kevin Christoff in August 2009.

He was the referee and sole judge of the fight between Henry Cooper and Joe Bugner in 1971, awarding the fight to Bugner by a quarter of a point, which remains one of the most controversial decisions in British boxing history.

Pat Petronelli from the Hagler camp objected to Gibbs being a judge in the fight, and he was replaced by JoJo Guerra, who scored the fight 118-110 for Leonard. Leonard won by split decision (118-110, 115-113, 113-115). Ironically, Gibbs, watching the fight at home, scored the fight 115-113 for Hagler.

Until April 2010 he was the Executive Presidente of the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS, Costa Rican Social Security Fund). He assumed the role on May 2006, following the second election of president Oscar Arias. He has also previously served as Minister of Education (1994-1998) and Vice-Minister of Science and Technology (1986-1990), all under National Liberation Party governments. Doryan has also had a long and diverse career in academic, public service, consulting and with international organizations. Early life Born to Dr. Edward Doryan and future Vice-President Victoria Garrón (1986–1990), he graduated from Colegio Saint Francis before attending University of Costa Rica and receiving a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. He went on to attend the Graduate Program on Power Systems Engineering at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. From Harvard University he received a Master in Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and a PhD in Political Economy and Government from the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Public service in Costa Rica Doryan served as Costa Rica's Deputy Minister for Science and Technology from 1986 to 1990, during which time he promoted a substantial increase in the number of students pursuing masters and doctoral-level studies in leading North American and European universities. He also played an active role in the efforts to upgrade levels of science and technological research, laboratory facilities, and strengthening the linkages between academia and private companies. Afterwards, he became Minister of Education from 1994-1998 duringJosé María Figueres' presidency. During that time, among some of the important initiatives implemented were those to establish technical education programs to upgrade the skills of the country's workforce, widespread use of computers in primary and secondary schools, the extension of the school year, and the introduction of more challenging curricula to the classroom. He was part of the team at the highest level of the Government that led the attraction of a new wave of foreign direct investment with a higher technological content. After 6 years abroad, he became Executive President of the CCSS from 2006 to 2010. The CCSS is a public social sector agency—the largest public or private entity of the country, which is responsible for both the national health insurance and the national retirement/pension insurance; two central pillars of the social protection network that cover the majority of the inhabitants of the country. Following the election of Laura Chinchilla he was appointed to the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, which until recently also had a state monopoly over telecommunications in the country. International career Doryan served from 1999 to 2001 as Vice President for Human Development at the World Bank where he was responsible for overseeing the Bank’s operations in education, health, nutrition, population and social protection (pensions, unemployment and other social assistance). During that time, he was an active member of The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health sponsored by the World Health Organization. At that same rank within the World Bank’s hierarchy, he assumed from 2001 to 2005 the position of Special Representative to the United Nations. Doryan was charged with advancing the new agenda of the World Bank at the time of building common ground with the United Nations and other key partners to advance the global development agenda. He was involved in the Bank’s engagement in the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development that took place in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002, in the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, South Africa in August 2002 and in the first part of World Summit on the Information Society held in Geneva in December 2003. He was also active in following-up the Millennium Development Goals and their implications for the way the Bank and the United Nations partners to do their business both at the global and national levels. Doryan also had oversight responsibility of the broad policy relationship between the Bank and the intergovernmental processes at the United Nations, including the Economic and Social Council, the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as with the United Nations agencies, programs and funds. He followed closely the process leading to the 2005 World Summit. Other roles He was a tenured full professor at the University of Costa Rica and later on he also taught at INCAE (Instituto Centroamericano de Administración de Empresas), a leading graduate business school in Latin America with activities in more than a dozen countries. As head of various major projects while at INCAE he gave advise at the highest levels of government on economic, social and institutional reforms in Central and South America, at different times he was consultant to the Organization of American States, the United Nations Development Program, and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. He was also the Director of the Latin American Center for Competitiveness and Sustainable Development at INCAE. In that capacity, he provided intellectual and managerial oversight to a team of professionals collaborating with the Central American presidents to develop and implement a strategic framework for competitiveness and sustainable development in the region. As a private consultant he participated in numerous exercises of strategic planning and organizational reform of medium and large firms, and small and large cooperatives. He has also been in his different capacities a speaker in Asia, North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe and Africa on issues related to global reform, knowledge society, economic and social policy, strategic planning and organizational reform, and health and education-related issues.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-homoserine:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include HSDH, and HSD. Homoserine dehydrogenase catalyses the third step in the aspartate pathway; the NAD(P)-dependent reduction of aspartate beta-semialdehyde into homoserine. Homoserine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of threonine, isoleucine, and methionine. Enzyme structure The enzyme can be found in a monofunctional form, in some bacteria and yeast. Structural analysis of the yeast monofunctional enzyme indicates that the enzyme is a dimer composed of three distinct regions; an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, a short central dimerisation region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain forms a modified Rossmann fold, while the catalytic domain forms a novel alpha-beta mixed sheet. The enzyme can also be found in a bifunctional form consisting of an N-terminal aspartokinase domain and a C-terminal homoserine dehydrogenase domain, as found in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and in plants. The bifunctional aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase (AK- HSD) enzyme has a regulatory domain that consists of two subdomains with a common loop-alpha helix-loop-beta strand loop-beta strand motif. Each subdomain contains an ACT domain that allows for complex regulation of several different protein functions. The AK-HSD gene codes for aspartate kinase, an intermediate domain (coding for the linker region between the two enzymes in the bifunctional form), and finally the coding sequence for homoserine dehydrogenase. As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and . Enzyme mechanism Figure 1. Hypothesized hydride transfer reaction mechanism catalyzed by homoserine dehydrogenase and NAD(P)H. PBD ). Homoserine dehydrogenase catalyzes the reaction of aspartate-semialdehyde (ASA) to homoserine. The overall reaction reduces the C4 carboxylic acid functional group of ASA to a primary alcohol and oxidizes the C1 aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. Residues Glu 208 and Lys 117 are thought to be involved in the active catalytic site of the enzyme. Asp 214 and Lys 223 have been shown to be important for hydride transfer in the catalyzed reaction. Once the C4 carboxylic acid is reduced to an aldehyde and the C1 aldehyde is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, experiments suggest that Asp 219, Glu 208 and a water molecule bind ASA in the active site while Lys 223 donates a proton to the aspartate-semialdehyde C4 oxygen. Homoserine dehydrogenase has an NAD(P)H cofactor, which then donates a hydrogen to the same carbon, effectively reducing the aldehyde to an alcohol. (Refer to figures 1 and 2). However, the precise mechanism of complete homoserine dehydrogenase catalysis remains unknown. The homoserine dehydrogenase- catalyzed reaction has been postulated to proceed through a bi-bi kinetic mechanism, where the NAD(P)H cofactor binds the enzyme first and is the last to dissociate from the enzyme once the reaction is complete. Additionally, while both NADH and NADPH are adequate cofactors for the reaction, NADH is preferred. The Km of the reaction is four-times smaller with NADH and the Kcat/Km is three-times greater, indicating a more efficient reaction. Homoserine dehydrogenase also exhibits multi-order kinetics at subsaturating levels of substrate. Additionally, the variable kinetics for homoserine dehydrogenase is an artifact of the faster dissociation of the amino acid substrate from the enzyme complex as compared to cofactor dissociation. Biological function The aspartate metabolic pathway is involved in both storage of asparagine and in synthesis of aspartate-family amino acids. Homoserine dehydrogenase catalyzes an intermediate step in this nitrogen and carbon storage and utilization pathway. (Refer to figure 3). In photosynthetic organisms, glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate accumulate during the day and are used to synthesize other amino acids. At night, aspartate is converted to asparagine for storage. Additionally, the aspartate kinase-homoserine dehydrogenase gene is primarily expressed in actively growing, young plant tissues, particularly in the apical and lateral meristems. Mammals lack the enzymes involved in the aspartate metabolic pathway, including homoserine dehydrogenase. As lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine are made in this pathway, they are considered essential amino acids for mammals. Biological regulation Figure 3. Homoserine dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway of several key amino acids. It is negatively regulated by threonine, and the pathway is subject to additional regulation. Homoserine dehydrogenase and aspartate kinase are both subject to significant regulation (refer to figure 3). HSD is inhibited by downstream products of the aspartate metabolic pathway, mainly threonine. Threonine acts as a competitive inhibitor for both HSD and aspartate kinase. In AK-HSD expressing organisms, one of the threonine binding sites is found in the linker region between AK and HSD, suggesting potential allosteric inhibition of both enzymes. However, some threonine-resistant HSD forms exist that require concentrations of threonine much greater than physiologically present for inhibition. These threonine-insensitive forms of HSD are used in genetically engineered plants to increase both threonine and methionine production for higher nutritional value. Homoserine dehydrogenase is also subject to transcriptional regulation. Its promoter sequence contains a cis- regulatory element TGACTC sequence, which is known to be involved in other amino acid biosynthetic pathways. The Opaque2 regulatory element has also been implicated in homoserine dehydrogenase regulation, but its effects are still not well defined. In plants, there is also environmental regulation of AK-HSD gene expression. Light exposure has been demonstrated to increase expression of the AK-HSD gene, presumably related to photosynthesis. Disease relevance In humans, there has been a significant increase in disease from pathogenic fungi, so developing anti-fungal drugs is an important biochemical task. As homoserine dehydrogenase is found mainly in plants, bacteria, and yeast, but not mammals, it is a strong target for antifungal drug development. Recently, 5-hydroxy-4-oxonorvaline (HON) was discovered to target and inhibit HSD activity irreversibly. HON is structurally similar to aspartate semialdehyde, so it is postulated that it serves as a competitive inhibitor for HSD. Likewise, (S) 2-amino-4-oxo-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (RI-331), another amino acid analog, has also been shown to inhibit HSD. Both of these compounds are effective against Cryptococcus neoformans and Cladosporium fulvum, among others. In addition to amino acid analogs, several phenolic compounds have been shown to inhibit HSD activity. Like HON and RI-331, these molecules are competitive inhibitors that bind to the enzyme active site. Specifically, the phenolic hydroxyl group interacts with the amino acid binding site.

Known internationally for its award-winning film, Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner, the first feature film ever to be written, directed and acted entirely in the Inuktitut language, Isuma was selected to represent Canada at the 2019 Venice Biennale where they screened the film One Day in the Life of Noah Piugattuk, the first presentation of art by Inuit in the Canada Pavilion. Isuma focuses on bringing people of multiple age ranges, cultural backgrounds, and belief systems together to support and promote Canada's indigenous community through television, the Internet and film. Isuma's mission is to produce independent, community-based media aimed to preserve and enhance Inuit culture and language; to create jobs and economic development in Igloolik and Nunavut; and to tell authentic Inuit stories to Inuit and non-Inuit audiences worldwide. Isuma is connected to Arnait Video Productions. History In 1999, the company filmed and produced the supernatural historical thriller Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner. It was a box-office success around the world, and won the Caméra d'Or for Best First Feature Film at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, six Genie Awards (including Best Picture), and several other international film awards. The film had its Canadian premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The massive critical success of Atanarjuat led to funding from Telefilm Canada, enabling Isuma to begin development on multiple scripts. One of these, The Journals of Knud Rasmussen, about the switch from shamanism to Christianity in Igloolik in the early 1920s, received the offer to open the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006. In 2011, Isuma filed for receivership, citing $750,000 in debts, including $500,000 to Atuqtuarvik Corp. of Rankin Inlet. A Montreal-based receiver, RSM Richter, put the company’s assets—most notably its film library—up for sale. Since Isuma means \\"to have a thought\\", the collaborators of Isuma Productions encourage alternative and multimedia processes designed to make the world at large think not only about the Inuit and their current plight, but about indigenous peoples in general, and the future of the role of community in society. Much of the New World’s wealth today was extracted from its Aboriginal citizens, who, by every measure, are now the most destitute populations in these countries. If the Inuit of Fast Runner ended up in 1922 in church, the Inuit of The Journals ended up in today’s newspapers stories, living in Third World ghettos scattered across the wealthiest First World nations. Historically, how a country treats its indigenous people is an excellent gauge of its social and political views on humanism in general; what happens to the indigenous peoples of any given country is a sign of what will eventually happen to the dominant culture in time. Even today the law, education, religion and media continue to efface living memories of Aboriginal cultural history. As Norman Cohn says, > Save the seals and Save the bears seems more attractive than Save the > people, but unless the rights of humans to live in their habitat are more > widely recognized and protected it's a little fatuous to even dream about > saving birds and animals. Isuma aims to increase awareness and focus about and for indigenous peoples of all cultures, not just Northern Canada, through encouraging multimedia approaches. Their goal is to ensure that these rights are not compartmentalized, but rather include the awareness of human rights in a larger cultural and holistic context: through exploration of spirituality, globalization, environmentalism, cinema, world media, and Native awareness.

However, most studies of glycerol dehydrogenase have been performed in Bacillus stearothermophilus, (B. stearothermophilus) due to its thermostability and the following structural and functional information will, therefore, refer primarily to the characterization of the enzyme in this bacterium. Structure Glycerol dehydrogenase is a homooctamer composed of eight identical monomer subunits made up of a single polypeptide chain of 370 amino acids (molecular weight 42,000 Da). Each subunit contains 9 beta sheets and 14 alpha helices within two distinct domains (N-terminal, residues 1-162 and C-terminal, residues 163-370). The deep cleft formed between these two domains serves as the enzyme’s active site. This active site consists of one bound metal ion, one NAD+ nicotinamide ring binding site, and a substrate binding site. Research into the structure of B. stearothermophilus shows that the active site contains a divalent cation—zinc ion, Zn2+. This zinc ion forms tetrahedral dipole interactions between the amino acid residues Asp173, His256, and His274 as well as a water molecule. The NAD+ binding site, resembling the Rossmann fold within the N-terminal domain, extends from the surface of the enzyme to the cleft containing the active site. The nicotinamide ring (the active region of NAD+) binds in a pocket of the cleft consisting of the residues Asp100, Asp123, Ala124, Ser127, Leu129, Val131, Asp173, His174, and Phe247. Finally, the substrate binding site consists of the residues Asp123, His256, His274 as well as a water molecule. Function Encoded by the gene gldA, the enzyme glycerol dehydrogenase, GlyDH catalyzes the oxidation of glycerol to glycerone. Unlike more common pathways utilizing glycerol, GlyDH effectively oxidizes glycerol in anaerobic metabolic pathways under ATP-independent conditions (a useful mechanism in the breakdown of glycerol in bacteria). In addition, GlyDH selectively oxidizes the C2 hydroxyl group to form a ketone rather than a terminal hydroxyl group to form an aldehyde. Mechanism While the precise mechanism of this specific enzyme has not yet been characterized, kinetic studies support that GlyDH catalysis of the chemical reaction :glycerol + NAD+ \\\\rightleftharpoons glycerone + NADH + H+ is comparable to those of other alcohol dehydrogenases. Therefore, the following mechanism offers a reasonable representation of glycerol oxidation by NAD+. Mechanism of glycerol dehydrogenase After NAD+ is bound to the enzyme, glycerol substrate binds to the active site in such a way as to have two coordinated interactions between two adjacent hydroxyl groups and the neighboring zinc ion. GlyDH then catalyzes the base-assisted deprotonation of the C2 hydroxyl group, forming an alkoxide. The zinc atom further serves to stabilize the negative charge on the alkoxide intermediate before the excess electron density around the charged oxygen atom shifts to form a double bond with the C2 carbon atom. Hydride is subsequently removed from the secondary carbon and acts as a nucleophile in electron transfer to the NAD+ nicotinamide ring. As a result, the H+ removed by the base is released as a proton into the surrounding solution; followed by the release of the product glycerone, then NADH by GlyDH. Industrial Implications As a result of increasing biodiesel production, formation of the byproduct, crude glycerol, has also increased. While glycerol is commonly used in food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other industries, increased production of crude glycerol has become very expensive to purify and utilize in these industries. Because of this, researchers are interested in finding new economical ways to utilize low-grade glycerol products. Biotechnology is one such technique: using particular enzymes to break down crude glycerol to form products such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, succinic acid, dihydroxyacetone (glycerone), hydrogen, polyglycerols, and polyesters. As a catalyst for the conversion of glycerol to glycerone, glycerol dehydrogenase is one such enzyme being investigated for this industrial purpose.

It was situated in the present town of Schänis in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. It was a house of secular canonesses of the nobility () and was dissolved in 1811.  History  According to the report of a monk from Reichenau Abbey the founder was believed to be Count Hunfried of Chur-Rhaetia, who was said to have promised Charlemagne to make the foundation for the worthy safekeeping of a precious reliquary cross containing a fragments of the True Cross, as well as an onyx vessel containing some of the Blood of Christ. Such evidence as is available does indicate that the abbey was founded at about that time, possibly as a daughter foundation of St. Stephan's Abbey in Strasbourg, but the foundation at Schänis soon fell into obscurity. After many years Ulrich I, Count of Lenzburg, restored the abbey to prosperity and a sound economic footing by numerous gifts of property. Also, by exchanges of land and rights of patronage he created a stable and unified ecclesiastical and parochial structure in the foundation's immediate vicinity. It was presumably at this time that the dedication was altered from the \\"Holy Cross\\" to Saint Sebastian. In 1045 Emperor Henry III granted Schänis Abbey royal immunity and free election of its abbesses. Despite several attempts at reform Schänis remained a free secular canonry with relatively relaxed rules. In the 14th century it lost its estates in Vorarlberg and the Rhine valley. The Vögte generally came from the greater aristocracy of the region. By inheritance from the Lenzburgs the Vogtei passed first to the counts of Kyburg, then later to the Habsburgs and the Counts of Toggenburg. By the transfer of the lordship of Windegg to the cantons of Glarus and Schwyz in 1438 the abbey passed, as part of the common overlordship of Windegg, to the Old Swiss Confederacy. Although the German Kaiser confirmed the abbey's rights in 1442, the connection to the Holy Roman Empire was broken; Glarus and Schwyz considered themselves from that point onwards as successors to the royal Vögte. Nevertheless, the abbess continued to bear the title of Princess of the Holy Roman Empire. Despite further attempts to reform the abbey's monastic life, there was no compulsion to take vows and only women of the aristocracy were accepted as community members. Applicants were initially obliged to prove descent from four grandparents of the higher aristocracy, but later from 16 great-great- grandparents of the same rank. In this way Schänis became a place of care for the unmarried female offspring of the higher nobility of southern Germany. During the Reformation the abbey was briefly suspended in 1529, but reinstated in 1531 after the re-Catholicisation of the Linthgebiet. In 1585 and again in 1610 it burnt down, with the destruction of all the ancient deeds and privileges. At the same time there were increasing conflicts with the protecting powers, Glarus and Schwyz, who felt the foundation to be an alien body and treated it accordingly. In 1782 the community buildings and the church were refurbished in the Rococo style. After the end of the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1798 Schänis Abbey, by the operation of the Act of Mediation of 1803, lost all its feudal rights and was gradually forced to dispose of all possessions outside the canton of St. Gallen. In 1811 the Great Council of the canton dissolved the abbey. The community buildings were sold at auction and the church was taken over for the use of the parish.

However, in nature these enzymes have the ability to catalyze the reverse reaction as well. That is, hydroxypyruvate, NADH, and H+ can act as the substrates while (R)-glycerate and NAD+ are formed as products. Additionally, NADPH can take the place of NADH in this reaction. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-glycerate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include D-glycerate dehydrogenase, and hydroxypyruvate reductase (due to the reversibility of the reaction). This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.  Enzyme structure  This class of enzyme is part of a larger superfamily of enzymes known as D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenases. Many organisms from Hyphomicrobium methylovorum to humans have some form of the glycerate dehydrogenase protein. There are currently several structures that have been solved for this class of enzyme including those for the two mentioned above with PDB access code , D-glycerate dehydrogenase, and the human homolog Glyoxylate reductase/Hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), . These studies have yielded a better understanding of the structure and function of these enzymes. It has been shown that these proteins are homodimeric enzymes. This means that 2 identical proteins are linked forming one larger complex. The active site is found in each subunit between the two distinct α/β/α globular domains, the substrate binding domain and the coenzyme binding domain. This coenzyme binding domain is slightly larger than the substrate binding domain and contains a NAD(P) Rossmann fold along with the \\"dimerisation loop\\" which holds the two subunits of the homodimer together. In addition to linking the two proteins together, the \\"dimerisation loop\\" of each subunit protrudes into the active site of the other subunit increasing the specificity of the enzyme, by preventing the binding of pyruvate as a substrate. Hydroxypyruvate is still able to bind to the active site due to extra stabilization from hydrogen bonds with neighboring amino-acid residues. Glyoxylate reductase/Hydroxypyruvate reductase =Biological relevance= Glyoxylate reductase/Hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is the glycerate dehydrogenase found, predominantly in the liver, of humans encoded by the gene GRHPR. Under physiological conditions, the production of D-glycerate is favored over its consumption as a substrate. It can then be converted to 2-phosphoglycerate, which can then enter into glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, or the serine pathway. As the name suggests, in addition to the glycerate dehydrogenase and hydroxypyruvate reductase activity, the protein also exhibits glyoxylate reductase activity. The ability of GRHPR to reduce glyoxylate to glycolate is found in other glycerate dehydrogenase homologs as well. This is important for the intracellular regulation of glyoxylate levels, which has important medical ramifications. As mentioned earlier, these enzymes have the ability to use either NADH or NADPH as the coenzyme. This gives them an advantage over other enzymes that can only use a single form of the coenzyme. Lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) is one such enzyme that directly competes with GRHPR for substrates and converts glyoxylate to oxalate. However, due to the relatively large concentration of NADPH compared to NADH under normal cellular concentration, the GRHPR activity is greater than that of LDH so the production of glycolate is dominant. =Medical relevance= Primary hyperoxaluria is a condition that results in the overproduction of oxalate which combines with calcium to generate calcium oxalate, the main component of kidney stones. Primary Hyperoxaluria type 2 is caused by any one of several mutations to the GRHPR gene and results in the accumulation of calcium oxalate in the kidneys, bones, and many other organs. The mutations to GRHPR prevent it from converting glyoxylate to glycolate, leading to a build-up of glyoxylate. This excess glyoxylate is then oxidized by lactate dehydrogenase to produce the oxalate that is characteristic of hyperoxaluria.

It is located in the municipality of Savski Venac, on the right bank of the Sava river. One of the most recognizable landmarks of Belgrade, it is colloquially referred to only as Sajam.  Location  Sajam is located on the Sava's right bank, in the western foothills of the Topčidersko Brdo and the neighborhood of Senjak, built on it. The Topčiderka river flows into the Sava, in the Bay of Čukarica, just south of the fair complex, while Novi Beograd and the peninsula of Mala Ciganlija are just across the Sava, which is at this point the narrowest ().  History  = Origin = Originally, complex was built as the modern neighborhood of Sajmište in Novi Beograd, across the Sava, and opened on 11 November 1937. As it was turned into the Sajmište concentration camp during the World War II, it was not reconstructed after 1945. City government selected three possible locations for the new fair and in 1953 the location of Šest Topola (\\"Six Poplars\\"), a former beach on the right Sava bank was chosen, in the westernmost extension of the neighborhood of Bara Venecija. This was confirmed by the city administration's decision on 13 May 1953. = Construction = Architectural design competition was organized and the jury selected the project by the architects Vladeta Maksimović and Milorad Pantović. However, the city government disliked the project and asked for more modern approach. Pantović worked in New York, Paris and London prior to World War II and Sajam was his first project to be realized and now he was charged with visiting the European fairs and suggesting something completely different from the architecture seen in Belgrade up to that point. The political climate changed in Yugoslavia in the 1950s, as the state broke ties with the Soviet Union. This brought to the ending of the Socialist realism period in Yugoslav architecture and the state wanted to appear as the modern, progressive and open to the world, giving Pantović almost carte blanche in choosing the modernist design. Construction began in June 1955. Engineers and Milan Krstić joined the designing-construction team. Architect was appointed as the head of the company \\"Belgrade Fair in Construction\\" which built the complex. Building of the massive domed halls, especially of the largest one, was a daunting task and drew attention from world architects and engineers. They were made of prestressed concrete. Since then, the pre-war Sajmište became known as Staro Sajmište (\\"old trade fair\\"). = Later development = First exhibition premiered on 23 August 1957 and already from that year, Belgrade Fair was member of the UFI. The inaugural fair was the International Exhibition of Technics, with 1,500 exhibitors from 28 states. In 11 days it had 1,150,000 visitors, or 2 times more than Belgrade had inhabitants at the time. After only several fair exhibitions, the monumental and costly project paid off itself and became the display window for Yugoslav economy. The very first broadcast of the Radio Television Belgrade (Dnevnik (\\"Journal\\") news program), was aired from Sajam on 23 August 1958, at 20:00. It marked 20 years since the television technology was exhibited by the Philips at the pre-war 1938 fair in Staro Sajmište. Basketball player Radivoj Korać set the EuroLeague's all-time single-game scoring record of 99 points on 15 January 1965, when the match OKK Beograd-Alvik Basket was held in Sajam during the FIBA European Champions Cup 1964–65 season.Radivoj Korac's 99 points. Second phase of the expansion of the complex began in 1966. Halls 7, 8 and 9 were built, but during the first exhibition held in them in the fall of 1966, they burned in fire. They were rebuilt in 1967, when the halls 10, 11 and 12 were also finished. The last phase was finished in 1975 when the western wing of the Hall 1, later renamed Hall 14 and today Hall 4, was finished. In 1961 the fair hosted two European sports championships: 1961 European Amateur Boxing Championships and, few months later, EuroBasket 1961. Both were held in the Hall 1. The same hall hosted the first major concert of the \\"youth culture and rock and roll\\" in Yugoslavia in 1966, with over 100 bands. Since then, the hall became a favorite venue for the \\"urban musical guerrilla\\", but also for the popular mainstream rock musicians. Concerts were held by Ekatarina Velika, Yu Grupa, Bajaga i Instruktori, Riblja Čorba. Foreign musicians include Eric Clapton (in 1984), Iron Maiden (1984, 2007), Deep Purple (2003, 2006), Alice Cooper, Kiss, Duran Duran, etc. Occasionally, Serbian folk singers were also performing in the Hall 1, like Džej Ramadanovski (1992; 30,000 spectators).  Transportation  Area in the vicinity of the Sajam is among the busiest transportation sections of Belgrade. Entire complex is surrounded by the railways and both railway bridges over the Sava which connect old and new sections of Belgrade, are crossing the river at Sajam: old bridge, right on the northern tip, and new bridge which rises above the Sajam itself. \\"Boulevard of Vojvoda Mišić\\" which runs next to the complex is a major route which connects outer neighborhoods like Banovo Brdo, Čukarica, Žarkovo, Košutnjak and Topčider, and thus one of the busiest single streets in Belgrade, well known for daily traffic jams. Just north of the Sajam is a highway and one of the largest interchanges in Belgrade, Mostarska Petlja, and a Gazela bridge over the Sava. Additionally, the tram lines are passing through the boulevard, too, and the very first tram line in Belgrade passed through this area (Gospodarska Mehana), connecting Kalemegdan and Senjak.  Characteristics  = Architecture = The fairground was built as the contemporary urban complex, with the accent of the entire composition of object being on three exhibition pavilions under the domes which are interconnected via enclosed walkways. Though the domes were designed in the most modern spirit of the European architecture of the day, not to mention the \\"futuristic\\" construction process, architect Pantović also applied the appearance of the traditional circular cupola's from the Byzantine architecture. The Belgrade Fair is the largest institution of its kind in Serbia, covering an area of . All together, it has 14 halls which cover an exhibition area of , dominated by the three large domes: Hall 1 (largest hall with diameter dome with a combined area of , or one third of the total area; it was the largest dome in the world 1957-1965 and largest Euoropean dome, Hall 2 and Hall 3. Belgrade Fair also has commercial space, depositories, and workhouses. Additional services include post office, bank, tourist agencies, carrier companies, custom, and ambulance. Also, within Fair there are several important hosting object of various purposes. = Exhibitions = 2011 Belgrade Book Fair Every year Belgrade Fair hosts over 30 regular international fair manifestations. Over 5,000 companies exhibit on the Belgrade Fair annually, with more than 1.500,000 visitors Many of these manifestations are members of respectable international organizations: the International Fair of Technique and Technical Advancements, International Fair of Clothing - World Fashion, International Fair of Furniture, Equipment and Internal Decorations, and SEEBBE (Southeast Europe Building Belgrade Expo) are members of UFI, Paris. International fair \\"BG CAR SHOW – MOTOPASSION\\" is one of the eighteen registered centers for presentation of European automobile industry by OICA, Paris. In addition to regular manifestations, domes of Belgrade Fair host numerous other exhibitions, concerts, scientific and specialized meetings and the range of services of the Belgrade Fair is supported by bazaar of consumer goods. Since 2001, the Belgrade Fair is a member of CEFA (Central European Fair Association) and since September 2003, the International Fair of Tourism is a member of ETTFA.  Protection  City and Republic institutes for the cultural monuments protection are working jointly on a proposal to put Sajam under the state protection. In January 2009 the government declared the entire complex a cultural monument, but then revoked its own decision a week later. The government revoked it as the placing of the entire complex would hamper the plans to privatize the venue. Instead, a month later, only the Hall 1 was protected by the state and declared a cultural monument.

The band's varied musical style is primarily garage pop with punk and pop/electronica influences. Many of their songs make integrated use of layered vocal harmonies and synthesizers. The band possesses a notable DIY work ethic, and maintains a widespread, global fanbase thanks to multiple self-produced releases, free downloads and heavy internet presence. The band was awarded \\"Best Use of Emerging Technologies, 2010\\" by the New York City-based music blog We All Make Music, alongside OK Go and Ben Folds.http://weallmakemusic.com/end-of-year-awards-best-use-of-emerging- technologies-2010/ Killola fans from all over the world submit photos of their band-related tattoos via the group's social networking sites. Tattooed fans are granted free-admission to shows, when the band is able to accommodate. Career The group formed in 2003 in Los Angeles. They recorded and released a free 4-song EP on stencil-screened CD-Rs, packaged in hand-painted sleeves. The band frequently dropped stacks of the free EPs at Amoeba Music in Hollywood, and at various stores, bars, coffee shops and venues around Los Angeles. The first formal Killola record \\"Louder, Louder!\\" was released in January 2006. They recorded the album with friends at locations all over Los Angeles, spending close to zero on the entire production itself. This 8-song CD sold steadily and heavily over the internet and at live shows, with strong internet-orders coming from England. This led to a May 2007 tour of the United Kingdom, actually preempting the band's first United States tour. Barrel of Donkeys, the opening track of Louder, Louder!, was released as a limited-print 7\\" vinyl single by England-based label Kerascene Recordings. In addition to CD format, Killola released their second album, I Am the Messer, on limited edition Killola USB flash-drive bracelets, preloaded with their album and several videos. In 2007, the band self-booked an 11-show UK tour through email and Myspace. The final performance of this tour was recorded as a live studio- session, to analog tape, at BreakThru Radio (BTR) in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England. The resulting 12-song Live in England radio-session was offered as a free download to fans. The band also released a double-disc DVD/CD package in the summer of 2007. Killola filmed and recorded a performance at the all-ages East Hollywood venue Safari Sam's on October 6, 2006, and from this recording they produced a live DVD/CD entitled Live in Hollywood. Their second album, I Am the Messer, was recorded in Los Angeles, California in late 2007 and early 2008; for production, the band tapped Luke Tierney (close friend and member of The Playing Favorites, and The Penfifteen Club), tracking the record in Tierney's home studio in Laurel Canyon. I Am the Messer was released in April 2008 on CD, as well as sold on USB drives. Killola was one of the first acts to distribute an album on USB flash drive wristbands. The drives, entitled 'Digital Arms bRACElets', were pre-loaded with I Am the Messer mp3 files, along with several hidden songs, photos and videos. In September 2008, Killola co-headlined a tour throughout the entire United States with indie-powerpop band The Action Design, from San Francisco, California. The tour lasted 32 days and the bands played a total of 27 shows together. Killola, Semi Precious Weapons, Nico Vega and Von Iva all performed on the 'Hell on Heels' tour, in early 2009. Killola opened for New York Dolls at SXSW in March 2009, and supported new-wave pioneers Berlin for multiple dates in April 2009. Kristeen Young and Killola did a west-coast tour of the United States in May 2009. Killola began their \\"Buy the Milk\\" U.S. tour on March 10, 2010 at Crazy Girls in Hollywood, California. On August 20, 2010 Killola's partnership with Aderra Inc. and their USB flash drive album were profiled on the Los Angeles Times Music Blog. On March 18, 2010, Killola announced the release of their Let's Get Associated album available on a USB Dog Tag Flash Drive.http://www.killolastore.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath;=3&products;_id=23&zenid;=dbc324a715fd72f4f3051a05203cb5ba The USB Dog Tag is reported to also include their entire CD back catalog of Louder, Louder and I Am the Messer. On December 17, 2010 Killola was featured in an article written by Damian Kulash, singer of rock band OK Go, in The Wall Street Journal. The article was an overview of Kulash's opinions about the future of the music industry. He cited Killola's partnership with Aderra Inc. as a prime example of how emerging artists can make money while touring. World's First Live Performance Via an Album On June 17, 2010, Killola performed four songs live with video, streaming real-time to a secret hidden page embedded in every USB Dog-Tag version of their Let's Get Associated album. Fans who owned the record were instructed via Twitter to \\"plug in your USB album tonight at 7pm PST and we'll perform for you.\\" This was the world's first ever live-streaming performance from inside an album. A second in-album performance took place on July 22, 2010, and was recorded and released free to non-Dog-Tag-owning fans. This performance inside the up-datable USB Dog-Tag was noteworthy in the \\"Best Use of Emerging Technologies, 2010\\" award from NYC-based music blog We All Make Music. Free downloadable album On August 12, 2008, Killola \\"freeleased\\" their second album I Am the Messer as a completely free downloadable album. This was made possible through a digital distribution agreement/partnership with New York/San Francisco-based digilabel True Anthem. The record was offered via an embeddable web 'widget' allowing the free-download mechanism to spread virally throughout the internet. The band offered two previously unavailable bonus tracks to listeners who downloaded the album in its entirety. The bonus tracks became 'unlocked' after the entire album was successfully downloaded. The album is free, based on a sponsorship by DW Drums, and Skullcandy. I Am the Messer remains available for free download via the band's website. Appearances Killola music was featured in three consecutive installments of LG15:The Resistance, an interactive web spin-off of the massively popular lonelygirl15 video series. The band released an alternate duet-version of \\"Is This a Love Song?\\" featuring renowned French singer Anaïs. This duet-version incorporates a verse in French, as the two singers interchange lines and melodies. The song was released for free, and currently remains available for free download on the band's website. Killola was the first band to be showcased on DIRECTV's original program The Fizz as the \\"Indie Music Pick.\\" In March 2007, Killola made an appearance on the Playboy TV program \\"Night Calls\\" with hosts Jesse Jane and Kirsten Price. In September 2007, Rieffel and Dunn began hosting a weekly internet music/talk show on Spread Radio Live, a non-FCC regulated web- based radio station founded by Dave Navarro. The popular show broadcasts live on Monday nights at 7 p.m. (PST) on the band's website. An alternate version of the Killola song entitled \\"I Wanna See Your Dick\\" was leaked onto the internet in 2010. The song features a guest-appearance from rapper Shunda K of Yo! Majesty. Killola released a music video for their song \\"Cracks In The Armor\\" on September 9, 2009. The video was produced by the band and the director with no outside funding or assistance. It features lead singer Lisa Rieffel who has been kidnapped to an underwater television studio where she is forced to perform for fish puppets. The other members of the band appear as commandos who enter the underwater world and free her to perform once again as a full band. Killola also released a music video for their song \\"She's a Bitch\\" on May 5, 2011. The video was directed by Hank Friedmann who helmed \\"Cracks In The Armor\\" for the band and has an appearance by actress Taryn Manning. Discography =Albums= * Louder, Louder!

Ainsworth house in Oregon City John Commingers Ainsworth (June 6, 1822 – December 30, 1893) was an American pioneer businessman and steamboat owner in Oregon. A native of Ohio, he moved west to mine gold in California before immigrating to Oregon where he piloted steamships and became a founder of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company and several banks. Early life Ainsworth was born in Springboro, Ohio, on June 6, 1822. His parents died while he was 13 years old, so he went to work for his uncle in Farmington, Iowa. They became partners in a business selling goods from boats along the Ohio River, but soon he split from his uncle and bought a store with a partner, which was sold at a good profit after only one year. He married a young woman, Josephine Augusta Kendall, who died fifteen months later. All of this took place before Ainsworth turned twenty. American West Ainsworth was not done partnering with his uncle. In 1844 they bought a steamboat and started a successful packet delivery service along the upper Mississippi River. Then the Gold Rush hit in 1849, and he sold his share of the business to go to California. The Gold Rush did not live up to his expectations, so he found a job piloting a steamer on the Willamette River in Oregon. In 1851, he married the daughter of Judge S.S. White, and built a house in Oregon City. In late 1860, Ainsworth and several investors started the Oregon Steam Navigation Company (OSNC). The OSNC controlled the shipping routes of steamers, railroads, and freight lines in Washington and Oregon. In 1868, Ainsworth had an annual income of $14,651, one of the highest in the state of Oregon. By 1869, the OSNC monopolized the Columbia River transportation market. In April 1879, Henry Villard purchased the OSNC for its full value of $5 million. Ainsworth retired to Oakland, California, after the sale. Later years and family After selling out, he entered the banking business in 1883 with the Ainsworth National Bank in Portland. In 1892, he started the Central Bank of Oakland. Ainsworth had seven children: George (with his second wife Nancy White) and John, Harry, Daisy, Laura, Maud, and Belle (with his third wife Sarah Frances \\"Fanny\\" Babbitt). Ainsworth was a Freemason, and eventually the third Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Oregon. In 1870, Ainsworth founded the Orient of Oregon and the Valley of Portland of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, S.J. and served as the first Sovereign Grand Inspector General of the Orient of Oregon. After retiring to California he wrote his autobiography. He died near Oakland, California, on December 30, 1893. He is the namesake of Ainsworth, Washington. See also *Capt. John C.

The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycolate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADH-glyoxylate reductase, glyoxylic acid reductase, and NADH-dependent glyoxylate reductase.  Structure  The crystal structure of the glyoxylate reductase enzyme from the hyperthermophilic archeon Pyrococcus horiskoshii OT3 has been reported. The enzyme exists in the dimeric form. Each monomer has two domains: a substrate- binding domain where glyoxylate binds, and a nucleotide-binding domain where the NAD(P)H cofactor binds.  Mechanism  Figure 2: The mechanism for the conversion of Glyoxylate and NAD(P)H to Glycolate and NAD(P)+ The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a hydride from NAD(P)H to glyoxylate, causing a reduction of the substrate to glycolate and an oxidation of the cofactor to NAD(P)+. Figure 2 shows the mechanism for this reaction. It is thought that the two residues Glu270 and His288 are important for the enzyme's catalytic function, while the residue Arg241 is thought to be important for substrate specificity.  Function  The glyoxylate reductase enzyme localizes to the cell cytoplasm in plants. It can use both NADPH and NADH as a cofactor, but prefers NADPH. The enzyme substrate, glyoxylate, is a metabolite in plant photorespiration, and is produced in the peroxisome. Glyoxylate is important in the plant cell as it can deactivate RUBISCO and inhibit its activation. Hence, glyoxylate levels are important in regulating photosynthesis. The enzyme is thought of as a glyoxylate-glycolate shuttle that helps in the disposal of excess reducing equivalents from photosynthesis. This is supported by the following findings: (1) glycolate biosynthesis in the chloroplasts is highest at low CO2 concentrations, (2) the enzyme is quite specific for the NADPH cofactor which is a final product of electron transfer in the chloroplasts during photosynthesis, and (3) when isolated chloroplasts are exposed to light, they absorb glyoxylate and reduce it, but they do not absorb glycolate. Due to the link between glyoxylate levels and photosynthesis, an increase in glyoxylate levels indicates that the plant is under stress. As glyoxylate levels continue to increase, they can harm the plant by (1) reacting with DNA, (2) oxidizing membrane lipids, (3) modifying proteins, and (4) increasing the transcription of stress-related genes in the plant. This highlights the importance of glyoxylate reductase, as it helps keep plant cells healthy and detoxifies the cell by reducing glyoxylate levels. In the absence of the enzyme, the side-effects of increased glyoxylate activity can cause cellular and developmental problems in the plant. Glyoxylate reductase can be used as a tool for studying photorespiratory carbon metabolism in plant leaves. Such studies can be carried out using acetohydroxamate and aminooxyacetate, which have been found to inhibit glyoxylate reductase activity. These inhibitors are not fully specific, but provide fully reversible inhibition of the enzyme and so provide a flexible tool for metabolic studies in plants.  Disease relevance  A human protein, GRHPR, has been identified that exhibits both glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase activities. The DNA sequence of this protein is up to 30% similar to the sequence of hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate reductases found in a range of plant and microbial species. GRHPR is an important protein in the human body, as it converts the metabolic byproduct glyoxylate into the less reactive glycolate. The reduced function of the enzyme causes a build-up of glyoxylate in the liver, and in turn causes an increase in oxalate levels in urine. The reduced enzyme function can be caused by a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder known as primary hyperoxaluria type II (PH2). This condition can cause nephrolithiasis (kidney stone), nephrocalcinosis and renal failure.  Industrial relevance  Glyoxylate reductase uses NAD(P)H to reduce an oxoacid (glyoxylate) to its corresponding α-hydroxy acid (glycolate). This class of reactions provides an opportunity for the synthesis of chiral hydroxy acids. Such products are of interest in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, such as anti-obesity compounds and semisynthetic penicillins.  Evolution  Glyoxylate is an important component of the glyoxylate cycle, a variant of the citric acid cycle, whereby acetyl-CoA is converted to succinate and then other carbohydrates in plants, bacteria, protists, and fungi. Studies have been conducted to trace the genes for the glyoxylate cycle enzymes to animals. The studies have shown that these genes are in fact present in animals, but the redistribution of the genes suggest that either that (1) these genes encode other enzymes that take part in the glyoxylate cycle, but are not orthologous to the known enzymes in the cycle, or (2) animals have developed a new function for these enzymes that have yet to be characterized.

She created practical, uncomplicated clothing that catered to modern, independent woman of the post-war era through to her retirement from the fashion world in 1985. Early life Cashin was born on September 28, 1908 (or 1907 or 1915) in Oakland, California to Carl Cashin, a photographer and inventor, and Eunice Cashin, a dressmaker. The family lived in several towns in northern California during Cashin's early years, and in each, her mother would open a custom dress shop. In a 1973 interview, Cashin explained her interest in fashion: \\"My mother was a dressmaker and before I could write I could sew.\\" Cashin attended Hollywood High. During high school, Cashin was hired by a Los Angeles ballet and theatrical revue company, Fanchon and Marco, to help make costumes for its productions. After she graduated, Cashin became its full-time designer.  Career  In 1934, Cashin moved with the ballet company to New York City to work at the Roxy Theater, where she created three costume changes per week for each of the theater's 24 dancers, known as the \\"Roxyettes.\\" Variety is reported to have described the 19-year-old Cashin as \\"the youngest designer to ever hit Broadway.\\" In 1937, at the urging of Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow, sportswear manufacturer Louis Adler offered her a job. She was hesitant to accept, stating, \\"The profit-conscious, business-like atmosphere of Seventh Avenue seemed very different to me from the atmosphere around the theater. I felt more at home with dancers, actors, artists, musicians, writerspeople like thatthan I did with most of the business men I met in the clothing industry.\\" While in New York, Cashin studied at the Art Students League of New York. After the U.S. entered World War II, Cashin designed uniforms for women in the armed forces. = Hollywood costume design = In 1943, Cashin returned to Hollywood and costume design. After producer William Perlberg recruited her, Cashin joined 20th Century Fox and created clothes for about sixty films including Laura (1944), Anna and the King of Siam (1946), and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1946). Cashin enjoyed the work in Hollywood, explaining: \\"I wasn't designing for fashion, but for characteristics, which is the way I like to design clothes for daily wear. I like to design clothes for a woman who plays a particular role in life, not simply to design clothes that follow a certain trend, or that express some new silhouette.\\" = Ready-to-wear = In 1949, Cashin returned to New York City. There, she designed the first sportswear collection with her name on the label for her previous employer, Adler and Adler. In 1950, she won her first Coty Award as well as the Neiman Marcus Award, an unprecedented feat in the fashion world. In 1952, she opened her own business, Bonnie Cashin Designs. Cashin was the first designer chosen for Patterns of The Times, American Designer Series, which was a monthly feature in The New York Times during the 1950s that made designer patterns available for home sewing. In 1962, Cashin was hired by Miles and Lillian Cahn as the first designer for their newly-formed women's accessory business. A division of their wholesale men's accessory company, Gail Leather Products, the Cahns named the division Coach. Internally, it was referred to as \\"the Bonnie Cashin account,\\" as she was a contracted designer, never a Gail Leather employee. Her classic designs for Gail's Coach division during the early 1960s included the shopping bag tote, the bucket bag, shoulder bag and a clutch-style purse with a removable shoulder strap. In 1964, Cashin introduced a brass turn lock/toggle fastening that was featured on her designs produced by the Cahns as well as on all garment and accessory collections produced by a range of manufacturers in the US and abroad, including Philip Sills, Meyers, Crescendoe-Superb, HBA, and D. Klein. Cashin designed two small collections for the Cahns each year to complement her garment designs for other manufacturers until 1974. In 1975, Meyers Manufacturing took over the production of her signature handbag designs. Cashin designed for over thirty-five firms including Hermès and Ballantyne, always with her signature on the label. She also created the first-ever designer flight attendants’ uniforms for American Airlines. In 1972, Cashin founded The Knittery, which produced limited edition collections of coats and handmade Scottish sweaters. That year, she was inducted into the Coty American Fashion Critics Hall of Fame. = Philanthropy = In 1979, she established the Innovative Design Fund, a nonprofit organization based in New York that gave up to $10,000 to designers with original ideas in home furnishings, textiles, and fashion so they could transform their sketches into marketable products. Toward the end of her life, Cashin granted exclusive and unrestricted access to her personal design archive to design scholar Stephanie Lake, whom Cashin described as her \\"little sister.https://bonniecashin.org/2011/03/12/stephanie-lake/ In 2016, Rizzoli published Lake's definitive monograph on the designer, Bonnie Cashin: Chic is Where You Find It.  Personal life  In the early 1940s after she had moved back to California, Cashin was married briefly to Disney illustrator and art director Robert Sterner. The marriage ended in divorce, and they had no children. In the 1960s, Cashin met Amy Vanderbilt's husband Curtis Kellar, who was head counsel for Mobil Oil. Cashin and Kellar were close friends until after Vanderbilt's death, when they became inseparable. They never married. Cashin's mother was her company's only other major stakeholder, with a one- percent stake. Up until her mother's death in 1963, the two lived in adjoining apartments in midtown Manhattan, where her mother sewed Cashin's samples for major manufacturers. Upon its construction in 1966, Cashin lived and worked at UN Plaza .  Death  Cashin died in Manhattan on February 3, 2000, due to complications from open-heart surgery.  Legacy  The Bonnie Cashin Archive, the designer's personal design archive, is privately owned in its entirety by her protégée, heir, and biographer, Stephanie Lake.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/fashion/coach-bonnie-cashin- designer.html?_r=0 In 2019 (as reported by Women's Wear Daily), Lake and her husband Cory opened the archive to collaborative partnerships. The Bonnie Cashin Archive and its projects have no affiliation with any Cashin trademarks registered in the decades since Cashin's death. Cashin herself never registered her name. = Influence = Cashin is often cited for creating both the concept of layering clothing and for coining the term. The idea of layering came from time she spent in living near San Francisco's Chinatown as a young girl. She also pioneered the use of leather, mohair and hardware in her design. Inspired by the brass turnlocks that secured the top of her 1940s convertible, the hardware became a signature feature of all of her designs, including her Coach handbags. Cashin was famous for her witty and ingenious approaches to designing for mobility, including a dog leash skirt: a long wool skirt that could be instantly shortened for walking up stairs by latching a small brass ring sewn at the bottom to a small brass clasp sewn into the waistline. In an interview with National Public Radio, Cashin explained the origin of the skirt: \\"My studio, out in the country, in Briarcliff, in the old carriage house, had steps that went up to a second floor. And I was constantly holding my skirts going up. I entertained a lot. And I'd be running up stairs with a martini in my hand. And so I thought I'd better hitch my skirt permanently.\\" = Exhibitions = Cashin's work is housed in over forty museums across the US. In 1962, the Brooklyn Museum presented the first retrospective of her work. Exhibitions of Cashin's work include: * \\"Director’s Choice\\" Philadelphia Museum College of Art, 1961 * \\"A Bonnie Cashin Living Sketchbook\\", Brooklyn Museum of Art, 1962 * (untitled exhibition of Cashin's drawings) Time-Life, London, 1966 * \\"The Art of Fashion\\", The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1967-1968 * \\"Made With Paper\\", The Museum of Contemporary Crafts, 1967-1968 * \\"Sporting Life\\", The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1972 * \\"Suiting Everyone\\", Smithsonian Institution, 1974 * \\"Bonnie Cashin Retrospective\\", Goldstein Gallery, University of Minnesota, 1976 * \\"American Designer Show\\", Goldstein Gallery, University of Minnesota, 1978 * \\"Women Designers\\", Fashion Institute of Technology, 1981 * \\"An American Fashion Institution: Designer Bonnie Cashin\\", Shippensburg State University, 1982 * \\"Meet Bonnie Cashin: Clothes for the Twentieth Century\\", State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1984-1985 * \\"American Style: Masterpieces of Fashion, 1880-1968\\", Rhode Island School of Design, 1986 * \\"So, You Want to be in Pictures: Ready-to-Wear by Hollywood Designers\\", Cincinnati Art Museum, 1987 * \\"Her Works Praise Her: Women as Inventors\\", Goldstein Gallery, University of Minnesota, 1988 * \\"Dressing the Part: Costume Sketches for Hollywood Films\\", Brooklyn Museum of Art, 1989 * \\"Bonnie Cashin: Form Follows Function\\", Mount Mary College, 1991 * \\"Paper Clothes: 1966-1991\\", Fashion Institute of Technology, 1991 * \\"In Black and White: Dress from the 1920s to Today\\", Ohio State University, 1992 * \\"Reel to Real: The Hollywood Designer After Film\\", Ohio State University, 1993-1994 * \\"Stipelman: His illustrations and the Fashions they Reflect\\", Ohio State University, 1996 * \\"Best Dressed: 250 Years of Style\\", Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1997-1998 * \\"American Ingenuity\\", The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998 * \\"Designing Women: American Style 1940-1960\\", Wadsworth Atheneum, 1998 * \\"Japonsim in Fashion: Japan Dresses the West\\", Brooklyn Museum of Art, 1998-1999 * \\"Bonnie Cashin: Practical Dreamer\\", Fashion Institute of Technology, 2000-2001 * \\"Way Haute West\\", Phoenix Art Museum, 2000-2001 * \\"Bonnie Cashin for Coach\\", Mitsukoshi, Tokyo, 2001 * \\"Women Designers in the USA, 1900-2000: Diversity and Difference\\", The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 2000-2001 * \\"Bonnie Cashin: An Elegant Solution\\", Goldstein Gallery, University of Minnesota, 2003 * \\"Seventh Avenue: Fashion Walk of Fame\\", Fashion Institute of Technology, 2003-2004 * \\"Chic is Where You Find It\\", UCLA, 2003-2004 * \\"Bonnie Cashin: A Classic American Sportswear Designer\\", Shippensburg State University, 2004 * \\"The Artful Line: Drawings and Prints from FIT’s Special Collections\\", Fashion Institute of Technology, 2004 * \\"Furnishing Fashion: Material Connections in Twentieth-Century Design\\", The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, 2004 * \\"Bonnie Cashin Plus Six\\", Robert Hillestad Textiles Gallery, 2007 * \\"Inside the Designer’s Studio: Bonnie Cashin\\", Drexel University, 2007 * \\"American High Style: Fashioning a National Collection\\", Brooklyn Museum, 2010 * \\"Functional Fashions\\", Milwaukee Museum of Art, 2019 * \\"Passer-by\\", Lafayette Anticipations, Paris, 2019 = Awards = Awards and recognition for Cashin's work include: * Vogue Fashions America Does Best, 1938 * Neiman Marcus Award, 1950 * The Coty Fashion Critics Award, 1950 * The Sporting Look Award, Sports Illustrated, 1958 * Philadelphia Museum College of Art Citation, 1959 * Woolknit Associates Design Award, 1959 * The Coty American Fashion Critics Award, 1960 * Lord & Taylor Salute for Creative Contributions to American Design, 1960 * Woolknit Associated Design Award for Special Achievement, 1961 * The Lighthouse for the Blind Award, 1961 * The Coty American Fashion Critics Special Award, 1961 * Sports Illustrated Award, 1963 * The Detroit Business Association National Award, 1963 * The London Sunday Times International Fashion Award, 1964 * The Lighthouse for the Blind Award, 1967 * Moscow International Fashion Award, 1967 * The Coty Fashion Critics Award, 1968 * Leather Industries American Handbag Designer Award, 1968 * The Kaufmann Fashion Award, 1968 * Saks Fifth Avenue, The Creator Citation, 1969 * The Mount Mary Golden Needle Award, 1970 * The Coty American Fashion Critics Hall of Fame Award, 1972 * I.

In 1970, he served briefly in \\"C\\" Company, 75th Ranger Regiment Infantry in Vietnam. Echanis then made his living as a martial artist, writer and editor. He was the martial arts editor for the magazine Soldier of Fortune (SOF) from 1974 to 1976. He died while working as a private security contractor in Nicaragua at the behest of the Nicaraguan National Guard. This was reported by SOF in an article published after the incident. Biography =Early life= Echanis was born in Nampa, Idaho. He enlisted in the US Army in 1969 upon graduation from Ontario High School. Echanis had long been interested in the military and came from a family where his father, Frank, and his uncles had all served during World War II. In published articles, Echanis indicated that many of his skills at stealth and concealment were inspired by his reading about American Indians and trying out these techniques when hiding from local police. =Military service= Echanis attended basic training at Fort Ord, California, and went on to airborne training at Fort Benning, Georgia. In 1970 he volunteered for duty in Vietnam where he served with Company C (Rgr), 75th Infantry, FFV/USARPAC as a scout-observer.DD 2-1, Echanis, Michael D, Record of Assignments, FOIA/Greg Walker Echanis received the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB), Purple Heart and Bronze Star with \\"V\\" device for actions during a company size NVA ambush in which he is credited with saving the lives of six of his comrades. He was also awarded the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.Information Releasable Under the Freedom of Information Act, National Archives and Records Administration, Michael Dick Echanis, Decorations and Awards, The Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross w/ Palm Device, FOIA/Greg Walker) Although severely wounded in his foot and ankle, Echanis was the only soldier capable of fighting back until help arrived in the form of U.S. helicopters. The closing paragraph of the Army's award narrative states: This incident is Echanis' only documented action during his Vietnam service. His service in the Army was a total of 15 months of which 2 months were served in Vietnam.Ronson, Jon (2004), The Men Who Stare at Goats, Simon and Schuster Paperbacks, pg 20. He was evacuated stateside to the military hospital in San Francisco where he made his recovery over seven months. Echanis' military record shows that during his short military career he did not attend or graduate from Ranger School and that although he participated in Phase One of the Special Forces Qualification Course he did not, for administrative reasons, progress further than this. =Martial arts= After his medical discharge in December 1970, Echanis returned to Ontario. He renewed his study of Judo and trained in Karate with now Ninjitsu Sensei Toshiro Nagato who had become a childhood friend According to a family member Echanis trained for a short time as a boxer during this period. This was under Al Barros, who lived and trained fighters in Boise, Idaho. Echanis fought several times as a boxer in the heavyweight class but left boxing to continue his study of the Eastern martial arts. Echanis developed a two-week hand-to-hand Instructor combat course sponsored by the United States Army John F. Kennedy Center for Military Assistance (USAJFKCENMA) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The program was authorized in December 1975 and Echanis was formally appointed the \\"Senior Instructor and Advisor to the USAJFKCENMA Hand to Hand Combat/Special Weapons School for Instructors\\" in a Memorandum For Record signed by Major Jerry C. Williams, then Chief, PSD, at the JFK Center. Six courses were presented in 1976. Echanis' combatives program was titled the \\"Hwarangdo Hand to Hand and Special Weapons Program\\". The USAJFKCENMA, then commanded by Major General Robert C. Kingston, issued formal Certificates of Participation in the \\"Hwarang Do/Hand to Hand Combat School\\" to include the Instructor Course the participant attended. Both MG Kingston and Colonel Timothy G Cannon, Chief of Staff, signed the certificates. Joo Bang Lee, founder and then leader of the World Hwa Rang Do Association affixed his personal seal to each certificate which conferred Black Belt ranking on the participant. Echanis then moved on to Little Creek, Virginia and A.P. Hill where, courtesy of Richard Marcinko, then the commanding officer of SEAL Team 2, he taught three 2-week H2H courses for the SEALs. These courses, titled \\"SEAL TEAM TWO Hwarang Do Hand to Hand Combat/Special Weapons and Special Tactics School for Instructors\\" were attested to in a memorandum signed by LT Commander Bruce Van Heertum, United States Navy. Van Heertum took over command of SEAL Team TWO upon Marcinko moving to his next assignment in Washington DC. Van Heertum designated Echanis as being appointed \\"...the permanent senior advisor and head instructor for the SEAL Team TWO Hand to Hand Combat/Special Weapons/Tactics School for Instructors.\\" =Death= On September 8, 1978, at 13:00, Echanis, Chuck Sanders, Nguyen \\"Bobby\\" van Nguyen, and General Alegrett died in an aircraft accident at the mouth of the Sapoá River near the Nicaragua/Costa Rican border. Books Echanis' name is listed as the author of three books about hand-to-hand combat: * Knife Self-Defense for Combat, Ohara Press, (1977) . * Basic Stick Fighting for Combat, Ohara Press, (1979) . * Knife Fighting, Knife Throwing for Combat, Ohara Press, (1979) . Much of the text material is verbatim duplicated in Hwarang-do founder Joo Bang Lee's book Hwarangdo also published by Ohara Press, supporting the claim that Echanis was a public front man for the Lee brothers in their attempt to promote Hwarang-do as the official US Special forces close-quarters fighting method Criticism Echanis was historically a free style fighter and after his wounding and recovery he traveled both the west and east coasts challenging and successfully fighting a number of black belt ranked studio owners/operators in their own backyards. Echanis served as the martial arts editor of Soldier of Fortune magazine from 1974 to 1976. Echanis was vetted by now deceased San Francisco martial arts instructor Art Gitlin. This was at the request of SOF publisher and editor Robert K. Brown, well before the 1978 printing of the SOF-paid-for book series (\\"Si Gung Art Gitlin – Haak Lung Chuan\\", by Michael DeAlba, Fighting Knives Magazine, January 1996, p. 71). According to Gitlin he was to \\"smoke out\\" whether Echanis was just one of many \\"ninjas\\" then petitioning SOF in the hopes of publicity or self promotion. Legacy =In popular culture= *The fictional character of \\"Staff Sgt Ben Echmeyer\\" (portrayed by actor Morse Bicknell) in the film version of The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009) is based on Echanis. =Warrior knife= Echanis contributed to the design of the Warrior knife. In an article published in SOF written after Echanis' death by Randy Wanner, the author, playing the role of the attacker, is seen using one of the prototype Warriors he had made for himself. Wanner refers to the knife he uses in this article as the \\"Echanis warrior knife\\". However it was the Gerber Mark II and the shorter Mark I fighting knives that became Echanis' most recognized personal weapon and signature trademark. =Accolades= *President Jimmy Carter sent the Echanis Family a Presidential Certificate honoring their son's service to the country several months after his death. *On October 8, 2013, Echanis was designated as Black Belt magazine's 2013 Weapons Instructor of the Year.

McMillan first conceived the idea for The 50 Year Show in 2007 while sitting on a London bus full of elderly people and wondering how he could make his mark. The second instalment took place on 3 October 2013, continuing each segment with the original cast performing alongside their younger selves on a giant projection screen, and the third show took place on 27 September 2018 at the Northcote Town Hall.

The announcement made Hungary the first Eastern Bloc country to exchange ambassadors with South Korea. At the time, a large number of officials from various Communist countries were in Seoul, having ignored North Korea's call for a boycott of the Olympics; along with Hungary, they also made various formal and informal contacts with the South Korean government. Trade with Hungary was already valued at US$18 million at the time; expansion of economic contacts was widely viewed as Hungary's motive in the establishment of relations. Full diplomatic relations were formally established on 29 January of the following year. At the time, Kim Pyong-il, the son of Kim Il-sung and half-brother of future North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, had just arrived in Budapest as ambassador; in response to Hungary's moves towards ties with the South, the North transferred him to Bulgaria. Bulgaria soon followed Hungary's example and moved to open relations with the South.  Notable events  = Defection of a North Korean diplomat (2006) = In 2006, a North Korean diplomat in Hungary and his family members defected to South Korea by entering the South Korean embassy there and requesting political asylum. By 2007, bilateral trade had grown by nearly ninety times to $1.6 billion; major South Korean investors in Hungary included Samsung and Hankook Tire. The Hungarian ambassador to South Korea, Miklos Lengyel, who began his service in October 2007, had previously worked in his government's mission in Pyongyang in the 1980s. = Sinking of Hableány (2019) = On 29 May 2019, a river cruiser called the Hableány sank, after being rammed by a larger river cruiser called the Viking Sigyn. The incident killed 25 of the 33 South Korean tourists on board the Hableány, and one remains missing (as of 15 August 2019). The incident resulted in South Korea sending rescue workers to Budapest: some of them also took part in rescue operations following the Sewol disaster in 2014. South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha also travelled to Budapest, to visit the survivors and relatives of passengers on the Hableány.

Marriage and children Kunigunde soon moved to Prague, where her fiancé Wenceslaus lived. He was the eldest surviving son of Ottokar I of Bohemia and his second wife Constance of Hungary. In 1224, Kunigunde married Wenceslaus. They were crowned in 1228. In 1230, Wenceslaus succeeded his father as King of Bohemia, with Kunigunde as his queen consort. However, Queen Kunigunde seems to be not important in politics, although she founded many monasteries. They had: *Vladislaus III of Moravia (c. 1228 – 3 January 1247). *Ottokar II of Bohemia (c. 1230 – 26 August 1278). *Beatrice of Bohemia (c. 1231 – 27 May 1290), married Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg. *Agnes of Bohemia (died 10 August 1268), married Henry III, Margrave of Meissen. *An unnamed daughter, who died young. When Wenceslaus' childless brother Přemysl, Margrave of Moravia died in 1239, the sons of Wenceslaus and Kunigunde were the only chances for the survival of the House of Přemysl. The first-born son Vladislaus died in 1247. His mother probably mourned for him less than his father, who was heartbroken. Kunigunde's tomb at the Convent of St Agnes of Bohemia In 1248, the younger son Přemysl was enticed by discontented nobles to lead a rebellion against his father. Queen Kunigunde stayed in Prague, but died during this revolt on 13 September 1248. Neither husband nor son attended her funeral. She was buried in the Agnes nunnery. The rebellion was defeated and Ottokar was imprisoned by his father, but released shortly afterwards.

He was one of his generation's principal painters of the Sienese School. From specific aspects of his early style, he is believed to have trained in the studio of Taddeo di Bartolo.

He returned permanently to Siena in 1405; there he painted several prominent fresco cycles in the Duomo and the Palazzo Pubblico. Further official commissions for altarpieces and for polychromy of sculptures attest to his versatility and to his prestige as one of the city’s official artists.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-histidinol:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called L-histidinol dehydrogenase. Histidinol dehydrogenase catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of histidine in bacteria, fungi, and plants, the four-electron oxidation of L-histidinol to histidine. In 4-electron dehydrogenases, a single active site catalyses 2 separate oxidation steps: oxidation of the substrate alcohol to an intermediate aldehyde; and oxidation of the aldehyde to the product acid, in this case His. The reaction proceeds via a tightly- or covalently-bound inter-mediate, and requires the presence of 2 NAD molecules. By contrast with most dehydrogenases, the substrate is bound before the NAD coenzyme. A Cys residue has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of the second oxidative step. In bacteria HDH is a single chain polypeptide; in fungi it is the C-terminal domain of a multifunctional enzyme which catalyses three different steps of histidine biosynthesis; and in plants it is expressed as a nuclear encoded protein precursor which is exported to the chloroplast. Co-regulation of the gene Histodinol dehydrogenase gene (HIS4) has been shown co-regulating the adjacent gene while it is under amino acids selective pressure.http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/afpuc.2015.62.issue-2/afpuc-2015-0031/afpuc-2015-0031.xml Structural studies As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .

Early life and education  Born on December 18, 1918, in Chester, Virginia, Trueheart earned a bachelor's degree (1939) and a master's degree in philosophy (1941) from the University of Virginia.  Career  Trueheart was a civilian intelligence analyst in the United States Department of the Navy 1942-43\\\\. He then served in the Army, rising to the rank of captain. In 1949 he joined the United States Department of State as an intelligence officer. Having joined the Foreign Service, Trueheart was posted to Paris in 1954 as deputy director for political affairs at the U.S. delegation to NATO in Paris. In 1958 he moved to Ankara, Turkey, to become executive assistant to the Secretary General of the Baghdad Pact. The following year he became first secretary of the U.S. Embassy in London, specializing in atomic energy affairs. In Saigon as of October 1961, Trueheart served as deputy chief of mission, the second-ranking U.S. diplomat in South Vietnam during what would become the final years of President Ngô Đình Diệm's rule, and during the initial buildup of U.S. military assistance to the Diem regime in its struggle against the Viet Cong. During the spring and summer of 1963, as the Buddhist crisis intensified, Trueheart's analysis of the political and military situation diverged from that of the ambassador, Frederick Nolting. As the ambassador vacationed, Trueheart warned of the possible liability to the United States of continuing to support Diem's government in South Vietnam, noted as \\"let[ting] loose the floodgates of doubt\\". Trueheart's position as the deputy chief of mission for the United States led to his involvement in the political turmoil which South Vietnam had had to embrace after the forced coup d'état of Emperor Bảo Đại in 1955. He did not assume responsibility for the embassy until May 1963, when Nolting was on a resting period from the position. Diem's assassination later in November 1963, just before that of the President John F. Kennedy, was neither anticipated nor welcomed by Trueheart, although he had foreknowledge of the coup, and admitted there were no better alternatives within the Vietnamese theatre, indicating that it was possible that \\"half [the peasants] don't know who Diem is.\\" However, this was immediately contradicted by his superior, Nolting stating emphatically that [Diem's] picture was \\"everywhere.\\". =Historical context= In October 1955, following a fraudulent referendum in which Diem had secured 98.2% of the vote, the Republic of Vietnam was established (known generally as South Vietnam) in which Diem declared himself President.Jacobs, p. 95. Stemming from this impossibility, Trueheart was shown to have little or no faith in the autocracy of the Diem government in South Vietnam, noted variously to have been part of a \\"get Diem faction,\\" and rebuking Diem with the fact that he would lose American support if the oppression of the Buddhist monks continued. At this stage, during the mid-1960s, the media had become an integral part of the reporting of news in the Vietnam War, with most infractions and incidents highlighted in national news. Polarisation between Diem and the Buddhists grew worse on June 11, 1963, when Thích Quảng Đức set himself alight in the process of self-immolation.

Her prints and various other artworks are held in public collections around the world including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Early life and education Elaine Gloria Kowalsky was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1948, the daughter of Cliff and Rosemary Kowalsky. She had three brothers, Cliff, Barry and Ken. She grew up in Charleswood. Kowalsky attended the School of Art at the University of Manitoba, majoring in Printmaking. Upon her graduation in 1971, she moved to London to further her artistic studies and her printmaking career. In 1973 she attended St. Martin's School of Art in London for a postgraduate printmaking course.Bear, G., Ikon Gallery (Birmingham), & Canada House Cultural Centre Gallery (London). (1986). Elaine Kowalsky: Larger than life. Printmaking She continued producing and exhibiting work and at the same time earned a Masters in Visual Theory, at the University of East London. At the time of her death, she was registered for a Master of Philosophy degree in Drawing at the Royal College of Art. In 1977 she was instrumental in organizing an ACGB Studio Conversion Grant for the building of the artists co- operative North Star Studios, in Brighton. In 1982 she was the artist in residence, Lowick House Workshop, Cumbria. In 1987 she was named to the first Henry Moore Fellowship in Printmaking at the Leeds Polytechnic. Kowalsky was a part of a number of exhibitions in Canada and the UK, including: *Canadian Student Printmakers, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax (1970) * Islington Studios Group Show, Upper Street Gallery, London, England (1972) * Canada House Gallery, London, England (1974) * Specialist Printmaking Group, Gardener Centre Gallery, University of Sussex, Brighton, England (1975) * Burnaby Print Biennale, Burnaby Art Gallery, Burnaby  Later work  DACS named their gallery located in Clerkenwell, London the Kowalsky Gallery in her honour. Exhibitions, artist talks and performances seek to engage the audience and artists in exploration of the role of the artist in the contemporary world. Elaine was the anonymous author of Diary of an Aging Art Slut published 1997-2004 in the journal n.paradoxa covering feminist art criticism and the work of women artists since the 1970s. The 22 installments from her Diary were a wonderful and witty contribution to n.paradoxa which expressed much of her energy, passions, social awareness and sense of humour. Copyright activism Throughout her career, Elaine was instrumental in working towards full copyright protection for artists and their works. Noting a lack of regulation in the industry, she organized with fellow artists the Artlaw organization, which primarily sought to give copyright to artists' images and royalty payments upon resale of art. This organization evolved into the Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS). Elaine was the chair of DACS for many years, and campaigned for legislative changes to give the copyright protection to artists that was afforded to other creative industry workers Personal life and death Kowalsky married Elton Bash in 1978. She died in a car accident September 2005, shortly before the copyright legislation she helped to bring about came into effect in January, 2006.

Galouye, first published in 1961. It is currently in publication by Victor Gollancz Ltd as a collector's edition. The book was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1962. Plot summary The Survivors live deep underground in a world of complete darkness, divided into two clans, one living in the Lower Level and one in the Upper Level. Their legends tell of the Original World where man lived alongside the Light Almighty (a concept of which they can no longer conceive) and away from the ultimate evil, Radiation, with its two Lieutenants the Twin Devils Cobalt and Strontium. The Lower Level Survivors venerate a relic known as the Holy Bulb. \\"So compassionate was the Almighty (it was the Guardian of the Way's voice that came back [to Jared] now) that when He banished man from Paradise, He sent parts of Himself to be with us for a while. And He dwelled in many little vessels like this Holy Bulb.\\" Jared is the son of the Prime Survivor, the leader of the Lower Level clan. He is himself due to become a Survivor (i.e. an adult clansman), but Jared is too busy with his quest to find Light. He rationalizes that to find distant Light he must first locate its opposite, Darkness, which is near and \\"abounds in the worlds of men!\\" He goes on to theorize that: \\"Darkness must be something real. Only, we can't recognize it.\\" ... \\"There's a clue [however]. We know that in the Original World - the first world that man inhabited after he left Paradise - we were closer to Light Almighty. In other words, it was a good world. Now let's suppose there's some sort of connection between sin and evil and this Darkness stuff. That means there must be less Darkness in the Original World, Right?\\" ... \\"Then all I have to do is find something there's less of in the Original World [than there is here].\\" ... \\"If Darkness is connected with evil and if Light is its opposite, then Light must be good. And if I find Darkness, then I may have some kind of idea as to the nature of Light.\\" By leaving the safety of the central echo-caster, with only a pair of click stones with which to listen, Jared exposes himself to soubat (once common cave bats that either \\"Cobalt or Strontium took ... down to Radiation and made [them] over into ... super-creature[s]\\") and Zivvers (people with an apparently unfathomable ability to navigate despite having poor hearing compared to the Survivors; it turns out that Zivvers navigate in darkness using infrared, while Survivors use echolocation). The soubats and Zivvers are thought of as similar, or even related, by the Survivors because of their similar abilities. \\"It was an uncanny ability nobody could explain, except to say [soubats and Zivvers] were possessed of Cobalt or Strontium.\\" Jared's quest for Light is interrupted by unexplained disappearances and an arranged marriage to Della, a girl from the Upper Level, the daughter of their chief 'the Wheel'.

Fresno was named for a county in California. The vessel was constructed by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in San Diego, California and launched in 1968. The ship entered service in 1969 and was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, taking part in training along the west coast and operational cruises to the western Pacific, taking part in the Vietnam War. Fresno was decommissioned in 1993 and laid up. The LST was nearly sold to Peru but remained in the U.S. inventory until 2014, when Fresno was sunk as a target ship in the Pacific Ocean during a training exercise off Guam. Design and description Fresno was a which were designed to meet the goal put forward by the United States amphibious forces to have a tank landing ship (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional bow door form for LSTs would not be capable. Therefore, the designers of the Newport class came up with a design of a traditional ship hull with a aluminum ramp slung over the bow supported by two derrick arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the Newport class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early World War II. Fresno had a displacement of when light and at full load. The LST was long overall and over the derrick arms which protruded past the bow. The vessel had a beam of , a draft forward of and at the stern at full load. Fresno was fitted with six Alco 16-645-ES diesel engines turning two shafts, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ship a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LST carried of diesel fuel for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ship was also equipped with a bow thruster to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles. The Newport class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the superstructure that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a utility landing craft (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The Newport class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have davits for four vehicle and personnel landing craft (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull. Fresno was initially armed with four Mark 33 /50 caliber guns in two twin turrets. The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 gun control fire systems (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977–1978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search radar. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a helicopter deck. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers. Construction and career The LST was ordered as part of the second group of Newport-class ships in Fiscal Year 1966 on 15 July 1966 and was laid down on 16 December 1967 at San Diego, California, by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company.Naval Vessel Register Named for a county in California, Fresno was launched on 28 September 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Marilyn Hyde, the wife of the mayor of Fresno, California. The vessel was commissioned into the United States Navy on 22 November 1969. Fresno was assigned to the Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, and homeported at San Diego. The LST alternated between training operations along the west coast of the United States and regular deployments to the western Pacific. The ship saw extensive service during the latter stages of the Vietnam War and earned two battle stars. Fresno was decommissioned on 8 April 1993 and was struck from the United States Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 2008. In 2009, along with , Fresno was reported to be sold to the Peruvian Navy.

The earliest historical records relating to what is now Phitsanulok Province indicates that at a time prior to or during the 11th century, the present-day city of Phitsanulok was but a small strategic Khmer outpost known as Song Khwae. During the next century, in 1188, Nakhon Thai, located near the center of the present Phitsanulok Province, was established as the capital city of the Singhanavati Kingdom, an early city-state of Thailand. Later, during Thailand's Sukhothai Period, the city of Phitsanulok emerged as a major city in the east of the Sukhothai Kingdom, and the great temples of Wat Chula Manee, Wat Aranyik and Wat Chedi Yod Thong were constructed. In 1357, the renowned Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat was erected, and the Ayutthaya Period witnessed the construction of several of the province's other chief temples. Phitsanulok served for 25 years as the capital city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. In 1555, King Naresuan the Great was born in the city of Phitsanulok. Naresuan played a significant role in the history of Thailand, as he expanded the kingdom (then called Siam) to its greatest territorial extent, by conquering sizable portions of modern-day Burma and Cambodia. In recent times, Phitsanulok Province has become an important agricultural center, part of the Bread Basket of Thailand, providing rice and other crops to consumers in Thailand and throughout the world. Extensive agricultural development over the last hundred years or so has spawned a modern infrastructure in the urban areas of the province, bringing with it an array of modern roads, universities, hospitals and other conveniences. Over the years, the Nan River and its tributaries have played a substantial role in the history and development of the region by providing a route for transportation, fertile soil for agriculture, and water for irrigation. The river waters have also served as a route for enemy invaders, and have been the source of periodic widespread flooding throughout the province. Prehistoric era Phitsanulok Province was inhabited during the Stone Age, as many stone axes have been found in the area indicative of the time period.Phitsanulok Thailand History However, these early hunter-gatherers are not likely to be ancestors of the Thai who now inhabit the Phitsanulok Province. The human population around Phitsanulok Province remained sparse until late in the region's history. A History of Thailand The settlement of the indigenous populations of the region began around the advent of rice agriculture during the Bronze Age, and continued through the Iron Age. Archaeologists suspect that Mon-Khmer speaking tribes spread through the region, bringing rice agriculture, metalworking, domestic animals. The main course of migration during the metal ages probably ran along the coast of Thailand, but migrants also traveled inland along the Chao Phraya to the Nan Basin and other areas, where it was relatively easier to establish settlements. The next major wave of migration into the province came not from the coast along the Chao Phraya, but rather from the mountainous areas of northern Thailand. These migrants were the Tai. Their course of immigration probably began south of the Yangzi River. As the Han Chinese spread south of the Yangzi around the sixth century BC, the ancestors of the Thai retreated into the high valleys and, over many centuries, migrated west along an arc from the Guangxi to the Brahmaputra Valley. The Thai brought rice-farming expertise to the mountainous areas of Northern Thailand, and eventually to the Nan Basin and the other lowland regions of Thailand. Some of the Nan River Mon-Khmer retreated into the hills as the Thai expansion continued, while others generally adopted dialects of the Tai languages and blended into the culture of the new settlers. The Tai language spoken in Phitsanulok (and most of modern Thailand) was heavily influenced by the Khmer culture as well, and evolved into the language we now call Thai, which is considerably different from other Tai dialects. Even after this Thai migration, the population in present-day Phitsanulok Province, other than along the banks of the Nan River was sparse. Predator animal species, as well as malaria, tropical temperatures and other hardships, kept the population from expanding far from the river, despite the region's extremely fertile soil. Khmer Empire During the 11th century, the city of Phitsanulok was but a small Khmer outpost called Song Khwae, meaning two rivers. At that time, the Nan and Khwae Noi Rivers both flowed through the city, making it a strategic gateway to northern Thailand. The urban development of Phitsanulok, which began during the trail end of the era of the Khmer Empire, was to a great extent modeled on the earlier development of the Khmer capital city of Angkor in Cambodia. In fact, Angkor Wat, the chief temple of Angkor, was a temple to the god Vishnu, whereas Song Khwae's forthcoming new name Phitsanu-lok literally means Vishnu's Heaven. Singhanavati city-state In 1188, King Boromma Chayasiri of Singhanavati (a city-state kingdom originally centered on modern day Chiang Rai) is said to have expanded the city-state to include much of what is now Phitsanulok Province, and relocated the capital of his kingdom to Nakhon Thai, from where he ruled for a period of time. The early city of Nakhon Thai thereby became the second urban center of the province, and one of the few urban areas in the Nan Basin, at that time, not situated directly on the banks of the Nan River. Rather, Nakhon Thai was situated at the foothills of the Phetchabun Mountains along one of the main tributaries of the Khwae Noi River. Nakhon Thai's period as a major urban center was short lived, however, as the throne of Singhanavati moved on. The predominant city of the region throughout the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya period, as well as in modern times, would be Phitsanulok, due to the city's prime location at a major tributarial junction of the Nan River. As a historical sidenote, the fourth successor after Boromma Chayasiri to the throne of Singhanavati (which survived through the Sukhothai era) was the famous King Ramathibodi I who became the first King of Ayutthaya in 1351, marking the dawn of the Ayuttahaya period of Thai history. Sukhothai period Historic photograph of Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat During the Sukhothai period, Phitsanulok emerged as the major city in the east of the Sukhothai Kingdom. It is during the Sukhothai period that Theravada Buddhism was first adopted as a unifying religion throughout the kingdom (although Buddhism in general was popular throughout Southeast Asia, including Thailand, throughout the era of the Khmer Empire). As such, the Sukhothai period witnessed the construction of Wat Chula Manee and the subsequent construction of Wat Aranyik and Wat Chedi Yod Thong. The renowned Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat was constructed in 1357, during the reign of King Maha Thammaradscha I of Sukhothai. Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat, more commonly known as Wat Yai, is famous throughout Thailand for its golden sculpture of the Buddha called the Phra Buddha Chinnarat (). Many Thai people consider the Chinnarat, which depicts the Buddha in the posture of submission, to be the most beautiful Buddha image in Thailand. The Chinnarat is the subject of the official seal of the present-day Phitsanulok Province. While the Ayutthaya period of Thailand had already begun in 1351, Phitsanulok remained part of the Sukhothai Kingdom for some time afterward. Sukhothai became a tributary state of Ayutthaya between 1365 and 1378, and in 1412, King Thammaracha IV was installed on the throne of Sukhothai by Ayutthaya. Around 1430, Thammaracha IV moved his capital to Phitsanulok, although after his death in 1438, the Sukhothai Kingdom was reduced in status to a mere province of Ayutthaya. By then, Phitsanulok can be said to have completed its gradual transition into the Ayutthaya period. Throughout the Sukhothai era, most of the land within Phitsanulok Province, aside from the city of Phitsanulok, remained sparsely populated virgin rainforest. Ayutthaya period The Ayutthaya period was the era of chief historical importance for Phitsanulok. By this era, the city of Phitsanulok had become a major urban center, specializing in porcelain production, and in addition, Phitsanulok's grand temples built along a major strategic waterway had transformed the city into a great cultural center. In 1461, Ayutthayan King Boromma Trailokanat (1448-1488), accompanied by more than 2,000 followers attended Wat Chula Manee, where he became the first king to have been ordained as a monk, a tradition that has continued on to present- day Thailand. The Ayutthaya period was also marked with war, as the competing kingdoms of the region, now growing more and more modern and capable, were competing for both survival, and for control over larger territories. In both 1459 and 1460, the kingdom of Lanna, a buffer state between the kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Burma, attempted twice to besiege the city of Phitsanulok, although both times Phitsanulok prevailed in maintaining its sovereignty. =Phitsanulok as the Capital of Ayutthaya Kingdom= Phitsanulok reached the peak of its historical import in 1463, when King Trailokanat moved the capital of the Ayutthaya kingdom to the city to strengthen the northern boundary of the kingdom. During Trailokanat's reign, Phitsanulok witnessed the construction of Wat Ratchaburana and Wat Nang Phaya. Around 1488, King Trailokanat's successor Boromma Racha III moved the capital of the Ayutthaya Kingdom from Phitsanulok back to Ayutthaya. =War with Burma= By the year 1562, Ayutthaya (including Phitsanulok) fell under Burmese occupation, and was forced to pay tributes to the Burmese King Bayinnaung. Just seven years prior, in 1555, a prince by the name of Naresuan was born in the city of Phitsanulok. After being held in Burma for nine years to ensure the fidelity of his father (Ayutthayan Prince Maha Thammarcha) in 1571, Prince Naresuan was released to return to Thailand (in exchange for his sister) and took the position of Governor of Phitsanulok, a position easily obtained since his father had ascended the throne of Ayutthaya as King Sanpet I in 1569. In 1584, three years after Burmese King Bayinnaung's death in 1581, Ayutthaya's tributary relation with Burma was unilaterally cancelled, which was inevitably followed by a vigorous Burmese attack on the kingdom. Naresuan fought back against the Burmese army, and in 1586 he occupied Lanna, a buffer state between the two kingdoms. In 1590, Naresuan's father King Sanpet I died, and Naresuan officially became the leader of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. In 1591 the Burmese started another attack, which was cancelled when the Burmese crown prince Mingyi Swa was killed by Naresuan in personal combat on elephant back in Nong Sarai (Suphanburi). During all of the battles in the war between Ayutthaya and Burma, Phitsanulok was a major place of recruitment. =King Naresuan the Great= Statue of King Naresuan the Great at Naresuan University After gaining independence from Burma, King Naresuan began a series of offensive attacks, beginning with an attack on Tenasserim in 1592. By the time of his death in 1605, Naresuan had expanded the Ayutthayan Kingdom to its greatest territorial extent in history, encompassing much of modern-day Burma, Laos and Cambodia, and setting the stage for the development of a unified Kingdom of Siam. Naresuan's triumphs as king earned him the nickname King Naresuan the Great, and his nativity in Phitsanulok is a great source of pride for the province. Naresuan is mentioned in the provincial motto, and a number of sites within the province, including Naresuan University, the Fort Naresuan Royal Thai Army base, and the Naresuan Dam are named in his honor. A King Naresuan the Great Shrine was also erected at the site of his birth at Chandra Palace in Phitsanulok. The palace is being restored, in preparation for opening it to the public as a museum. =Late Ayutthayan Period= The Ayutthaya period lasted well into the 18th century, during which the Province of Phitsanulok continued to develop. In contrast to the early Ayutthayan construction of elaborate city temples, the late Ayutthayan period witnessed the construction of a number of smaller temples in the various settlements throughout the province's rural areas. Temples such as Wat Grung See Jayrin were constructed with ornate chedi, with architecture modeled on the great temples of Ayutthaya. Even at the end of the Ayutthayan Period, however, most of the province still remained sparsely populated jungle. As long periods of war had ensued during the Ayutthaya period, many of the province's early temples were in a state of great disrepair, if not largely annihilated. Efforts to improve the early temples began in the late Ayutthayan Period, including a decree of King Boromma Kot in 1756, ordering mother-of-pearl inlaid doors to be built for the entrance to Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat. The doors still mark the entrance of the temple today. Modern Siam/Thailand =19th century= The 19th century was the period during which many of the smaller settlements in western Phitsanulok Province (then Phitsanulok Precinct) such as Bang Krathum, Nakhon Pa Mak and Wang Thong began to turn into urban societies. Phitsanulok's municipal market was established in the village of Ban Sam Ruen in Nakhon Pa Mak, and during this period, the sport of long-boat racing emerged as a means of friendly competition between the scattered riparian villages, which were still separated by dense forest. Temple restorations in the city of Phitsanulok continued through the 19th century, including the restoration of Wat Ratchaburana ordered by King Mongkut. In 1898, The Phitsanulok municipal market moved up the Wang Thong River from Ban Sam Ruen to Ban Wang Thong as the upriver portions of the province became more and more developed.Alternate Identities: The Chinese of Contemporary Thailand New technology, agricultural and otherwise, was introduced into the region, in part by influences of western colonial powers in Southeast Asia, which paved the way for widespread rapid development of the province in the 20th century. The 19th century also brought a wave of Laotian and Chinese immigrants to the Phitsanulok Province, who each added their contributions to the local culture, especially in the areas of cuisine, art and language. In 1895, King Chulalongkorn implemented far-reaching reforms in the administration of Thailand which divided Phitsanulok Province into amphoe and tambon. While the boundaries and names of many of the original subdivisions have changed, the system is still in place throughout Phitsanulok and the rest of Thailand. =20th century= During the 20th century, Phitsanulok Province became an important agricultural center, part of the Bread Basket of Thailand, providing rice and other crops to consumers in Thailand and throughout the world. Extensive agricultural development over the last hundred years or so has spawned a modern infrastructure in the urban areas of the province, bringing with it an array of modern roads, universities, hospitals and other conveniences. During the 20th century, nearly all of the lowlands in Phitsanulok Province were cleared of their rainforest vegetation to make way for rice farms. Systems of intricate canals were also implemented throughout the region to provide irrigation and drainage for the farms. The population of the province exploded during this time period, due in large to the clearing of the forest, and also as a result of increased access to modern modes of transportation, including highways, railroad and even an airport in the city of Phitsanulok. This rapid development also created problems including large-scale habitat destruction and increased severely of seasonal flooding and drought. A timeline illustrating the key events of the 20th century within the province is as follows: *In 1908, Thailand's northern railway reached Phitsanulok. *In 1910, Phitsanulok's status was changed from precinct to province. *The first agricultural cooperative in Thailand, the Wat Chan Agricultural Cooperative Unlimited Liability, was established in Phitsanulok Province on February 26, 1916. *The Phitsanulok fire of 1955 destroyed much of the older portion of the city of Phitsanulok. *In 1956, the construction of Route 12, Phitsanulok-Lom Sak Highway was completed. *On Nov 28, 1961, the King Naresuan Shrine was completed at Chan Palace. *On January 25, 1967, the Phitsanulok campus of College of Education (Today's Naresuan University) was established. *The province was severely flooded in 1967, prompting plans for construction of a major dam north of the city of Phitsanulok. *From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the territory now set aside as Phu Hin Rong Kla National Park was the main stronghold of the now defunct communist People's Liberation Army of Thailand. *Thung Salaeng Luang was established as a national park in 1972. *The Naresuan Dam was constructed throughout the span of 1976 through 1985 on the Nan River as part of the Phitsanulok Irrigation Project.Phitsanulok Irrigation Project *In 1982, the historical Brotherly Villages Boat Race was reintroduced to promote the unity of Wang Thong communities.Alternate Identities: The Chinese of Contemporary Thailand *Phu Hin Rong Kla was established as a national park in 1984. *The Chat Trakan District of Phitsanulok Province was a front in the Thailand-Laos Border War of December, 1987 - February, 1988.Thailand-Laos Border War =Recent events= Present day Phitsanulok Province can perhaps best be described as a region in a state of rapid transition into a fully modern society. In suburban areas, modern homes are being erected where traditional Thai-style houses once stood, and conveniences such as running water and public health centers are emerging in even the most remote reaches of the province. As the rest of the world has entered the communication era, so too has Phitsanulok. Even the remote Bang Krathum post office now has an internet kiosk where villagers can access the web at their leisure. Since the introduction of the mobile phone to the region, residents of the province can now communicate with people and businesses throughout Thailand and abroad with ease, which will no doubt have considerable impact on the future economic development of the region. A list of noteworthy events which occurred since 2000 in the province is as follows: *In June 2001, Phitsanulok hosted the Asia-Pacific Summit of Women Mayors and Councillors. *In 2005, two cases of bird flu were uncovered on a duck farm in the province. 2007 flooding Deforestation and urban development along the river banks in the region, combined with seasonal downpours in the Phetchabun Mountains have led to severe flooding in recent years within the province. Flooding in the province in 2007 was described by the Bangkok post as the worst floods in 40 years.Phitsanulok has worst floods in 40 years (Bangkok Post article) On October 4, 2007, 100 rescue workers and 100 soldiers were dispatched to assist stranded residents in tambon Chompu and tambon Ban Mung, where water levels rose more than a meter.Phitsanulok Residents stranded in flash floods On that same day, Phitsanulok Governor Somboon Sripattanawat declared the Noen Maprang District a disaster zone.

On October 14, 2007, flood water pressure sent inflows through the Nakhon Phitsanulok Municipality's sewage system, flooding three communities.Provinces, capital put on flood alert-Water still rising, warns RID chief On October 15, 2007, the Royal Irrigation Department announced plans to construct six dams on the Wang Thong River as an attempt to solve the problem of seasonal flooding. On October 16, 2007 Thung Salaeng Luang National Park was temporarily closed for fear that tourists may become trapped in its caves by flood waters (This was prompted by an incident in Surat Thani's Khao Sok National Park where a group of cave exploring tourists drowned). A meeting of senior officials is scheduled for October 31, 2007 to discuss the progress of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the dam proposal. At least one of the dams will be in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, but officials ensure that it will not be built in a wildlife sanctuary area. Flooding in the region is a recurring problem in Phitsanulok Province this time of year. In 2006, for example, between August 20 and December 13, over 22,000 people in 70 villages within Phitsanulok were affected by flooding, and over of farmland and 194 roads within the province were submerged by flood waters.2006 Global Register of Major Flood Events  See also  References Category:Phitsanulok Province Phitsanulok Province ","title":"History of Phitsanulok Province"},{"id":"13900787","text":"Army General Lê Văn Tỵ (17 May 1904 - 20 October 1964)https://dongsongcu.wordpress.com/2016/09/16/thong-tuong-le-van-ty-tong- tham-muu-truong-quan-doi-quoc-gia/ was the first chief of staff of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

Noted primarily for being promoted through TV commercials in which a box of the cereal would suddenly appear and interrupt some other activity, Clackers was a wheat-based breakfast cereal whose flavor was intended to be similar to that of graham crackers. Each individual piece of the cereal was almost large enough to fit onto a teaspoon, and the shape of a typical piece resembled a small gear with a hole in the center. Pre-sweetened, promoted as being nutritious, and formulated to be crunchy in milk for longer periods than the mean average for breakfast cereals, Clackers was primarily marketed for those younger than thirteen years of age. But the cereal was not a major success for General Mills, partially because the commercials, which many adult viewers considered annoying, actually overshadowed the cereal itself.

Austria-Hungary Prior to 1918, Croatia, including Slavonia, was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and beginning in 1850 with the introduction of postage stamps, the stamps of the empire were used. In 1871, after the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, the new stamps of the Kingdom of Hungary were used, except in Dalmatia which continued to use Austrian stamps. A 1918 stamp for Croatia depicting \\"Liberated Croatia\\" Kingdom in 1918 In 1918, as part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (SHS), Croatia overprinted the existing stocks of Hungarian stamps, with \\"Hrvatska SHS\\".

Fiume (Rijeka) In 1918 with the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Rijeka was disputed between Italy and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. For a very short time, overprinted Hungarian stamps were used, but in 1919 Italian irredentists established the Italian Regency of Carnaro which issued its own stamps. These were replaced by the stamps of the Free State of Fiume.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, he relocated to Florida with his family when he was young. As a boy, he often served as guide to visiting fishermen and plume hunters, although he later denounced poaching after legislation was passed to protect the dwindling number of birds. In 1902, Bradley was hired by the American Ornithologists' Union, at the request of the Florida Audubon Society, to become one of the country's first game wardens. Tasked with protecting the area's wading birds from hunters, he patrolled the area stretching from Florida's west coast, through the Everglades, to Key West, single-handedly enforcing the ban on bird hunting.Clement, Gail. \\"Everglades Biographies: Guy Bradley\\". Everglades Digital Library. Retrieved on July 1, 2010. Bradley was shot and killed in the line of duty, after confronting a man and his two sons who were hunting egrets in the Everglades. His much-publicized death at the age of 35 galvanized conservationists, and served as inspiration for future legislation to protect Florida's bird populations. Several national awards and places have been named in his honor. Early life Guy Bradley was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1870. His family had strong ties to the city; his father, Edwin Ruthven Bradley, was born there in 1840, and two members of the family held high positions in Chicago's law enforcement.McIver, p. 10. Six years after Guy's birth, the family relocated to Florida. After making their home in smaller towns, the family eventually settled in Fort Lauderdale, where Edwin became keeper of the Fort Lauderdale House of Refuge. Shortly after the death of Bradley's sister Flora from an unknown illnesswhich also affected Guy, leaving him ill for several yearsthe family moved to the vicinity of Lake Worth.McIver, p. 25. Edwin became a postman, earning an annual wage of six hundred dollars. He, with the help of his oldest son, later received national attention for being one of several barefoot mailmen, who operated until a road was constructed in 1892.Wilbanks, p. 82. The family then relocated to Miami, where Edwin served as superintendent of the Dade County school district. In 1885, fifteen-year-old Guy and his older brother Louis served as scouts for noted French plume hunter Jean Chevalier on his trip to the Everglades.Tebeau, p. 75. Accompanied by their friend Charlie W. Pierce, the men set sail on Pierce's craft, the Bonton, ending their journey in Key West. At the time, plume feathersselling for more than $20 an ounce ($ in 2011)were reportedly more valuable than gold.McIver, p. 16. On their expedition, which lasted several weeks, the young men and Chevalier's party killed 1,397 individual birds of thirty-six different species.McIver, p. 29. Hunt for plumes A great egret family; plume birds were often shot while sitting on their nests. At the turn of the 20th century, vast numbers of birds were being killed in order to provide feathers to decorate women's hats. The fashion craze, which began in the 1870s, became so prominent that by 1886 birds were being killed for the millinery trade at a rate of five million a year; many species faced extinction as a result.McIver, p. xiii. In Florida, plume birds were first driven away from the most populated areas in the northern part of the state, and forced to nest further south. Rookeries concentrated in and around the Everglades area, which had abundant food and seasonal dry periods, ideal for nesting birds. By the late 1880s, there were no longer any large numbers of plume birds within reach of Florida's most settled cities.McIver, p. 46. The most popular plumes came from various species of wading birds, known as \\"little snowies\\" for their snowy-white feathers; even more prized were the \\"nuptial plumes\\", grown during mating season and displayed by birds during courtship.Shearer, p. 36. Poachers often stole into the densely populated rookeries, where they would shoot and then pluck the roosting birds clean, leaving their carcasses to rot. Unprotected eggs became easy prey for predators, as were newly hatched birds, who also starved or died from exposure. One ex-poacher would later write of the practice, \\"The heads and necks of the young birds were hanging out of the nests by the hundreds. I am done with bird hunting forever!\\"Huffstodt, pp. 42-43. In the mid-1890s, Edwin became head of the Florida Coast Line Canal and Transportation Company and then the Model Land Company, both of which sold land for the railroads.Tebeau, pp. 145-146. In 1900, after twenty years living in Lake Worth, the family moved to Flamingo in Monroe County, near the Everglades. Edwin had heard that railroad tycoon Henry Flagler planned to build his railroad through the area, and that the then primitive city of Flamingo would flourish as a result; Flagler later changed his mind, deciding to build to Key West instead. Guy and his brother, who continued working as guides and hunters, each received a quarter of a mile of land on Florida Bay as part of their father's deal with the Model Land Company. While working variously as a postman, farmer and boatman during his 20s, Guy continued to augment his income with an occasional plume hunt.McIver, p. 60. In 1899, he married the young widow Sophronia (\\"Fronie\\") Vickers Kirvin from Key West. Their first child, Morrell, was born a year later.McIver, pp. 98-99. Game warden When the Florida legislature passed the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) model law to outlaw the killing of plume birds, this created a need for qualified and competent wardens to enforce it. Kirk Munroe, a friend of the Bradley family and a founding vice president of the Florida Audubon Society, recommended Guy for the position. Seen as different from the other \\"wild\\" young men in Flamingo, Bradley was described as \\"pleasant, quiet… fair, with blue eyes, always whistling and a pretty good violinist… [a] social asset to the isolated, frontier community, clean-cut, reliable, courageous, energetic and conscientious\\". Bradley was at this time a reformed plume hunter, who had given up the profession after the passage of the Lacey Act of 1900. In a letter to William Dutcher, president of the Florida Audubon Society, Bradley wrote \\"I used to hunt plume birds, but since the game laws were passed, I have not killed a plume bird. For it is a cruel and hard calling not withstanding being unlawful. I make this statement upon honor.\\"Davis, p. 187. Soon after being accepted for the position, Bradley traveled to Key West to secure his appointment as both game warden and deputy sheriff, which gave him the authority to arrest those hunting illegally.McIver, p. 114. As one of the first game wardens, Bradley was responsible for reporting suspected poachers and the businesses with which they worked.McIver, p. 118. He was paid a monthly stipend of $35 ($ in 2010) to single-handedly patrol the enormous area stretching from the Ten Thousand Islands on Florida's west coast, through the Everglades, to Key West, which served as nesting areas for popular plume birds such as egrets, herons, spoonbills and ibis. Bradley took his job seriously; he educated locals about the newly implemented laws which made plume hunting a punishable offense, spoke to hunters directly, and posted warning signs throughout his territory. He also set up a network of spies who watched for suspicious behavior, and employed his brother Louis and others close to him to work as assistant wardens during the height of the plume season.Davis, p. 189. Difficulties \\"The cruelties of fashion: fine feathers make fine birds\\"; the collection of feathers for hats led to the near extinction of wading birds in the Everglades. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt created the first wildlife refuge in the United States, Pelican Island. Its first warden, Paul Kroegel, joined forces with Bradley to enforce the illegality of bird-hunting in Florida.McIver, p. 134. By 1904, the various Audubon organizations had 34 wardens employed in ten states. Conservationist publications were optimistic that Bradley and other wardens would be successful in their enforcement; in AOU's January 1904 issue of The Auk, an editor wrote: \\"The natives are beginning to realize that the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who are not to be trifled with. The Bradleys have the reputation of being the best rifle shots in that vicinity and they would not hesitate to shoot when necessary.\\"McIver, p. 139. After accepting the position as game warden, however, Bradley became a vilified figure in southern Florida; working alone, with no reinforcements, he had been shot at more than once.Shearer, p. 37. In 1904, Bradley alerted visiting ornithologist and author Frank Chapman that one of the more isolated rookeries, called Cuthbert, had been \\"shot out\\" despite previously having been found to be in good condition. He reportedly said, \\"You could've walked right around the Rookery on those bird's bodies—between four and five hundred of them.\\" \\"Cuthbert Rookery Diorama \\". American Museum of Natural History. Retrieved on July 7, 2010. Bradley took the slaughter to mean that he was being watched by local hunters, who only could have discovered the rookery by tracking his movements.McIver, p. 141. Chapman later wrote, \\"Under his guardianship the 'white birds' had increased in numbers, which, with aigrettes selling at $32 an ounce, made the venture worth the risk (for there was a risk; as the man who attempted to 'shoot out' a rookery while Bradley was on guard would probably have lost his own 'plume'); the warden watched and in his absence his charges were slaughtered.\\"McIver, pp. 141-142. Death On July 8, 1905, Bradley heard gunshots close to his waterfront home in Flamingo. He set sail in his small skiff, and encountered a father and his two sons by the name of Smith, who were shooting up a rookery. The families had known each other for years, but Civil War veteran Walter Smith had a reputation for being troublesome, and Bradley had previously had altercations with him. He had arrested Smith on one occasion and Smith's oldest son, Tom, twice for poaching.McIver, p. 144. Smith threatened to retaliate against Bradley if he tried again, reportedly telling the warden, \\"You ever arrest one of my boys again, I'll kill you.\\"Davis, p. 190. According to Walter Smith's account, Bradley encountered the three men as they were loading dead plume birds onto their boat. An argument ensued, and as the warden attempted to arrest one of the young men, Smith opened fire with his hunting rifle, fatally wounding Bradley. His body was found the next day by his brother's search party, after drifting from the scene of the crime. He had bled to death.Shearer, p. 38. Aftermath Smith set sail to Key West and turned himself in to the authorities the next day. Despite evidence found by the prosecutionpaid for by the Florida Audubon Societythat Bradley had not fired his weapon, Smith claimed self-defense. He maintained that the warden had fired first, but missed, hitting Smith's boat.Shearer, p. 39. Those who knew Bradley, however, insisted that he had been an excellent shot, and would not have missed his target had he, in fact, shot first. Smith later was found not guilty of murder, when the jury decided there was insufficient evidence to convict; he served only five months in jail, unable to pay $5,000 for bail.McIver, p. 156. While he was incarcerated, Bradley's two brothers-in-law burned down Smith's Flamingo home.Davis, p. 191. A great egret wades through a cypress grove. Bradley's death and Smith's acquittal made national headlines; detailed stories ran in the New York Times,\\"Florida Fisherman Who Shot Game Warden Says It Was Done in Self-Defense\\".

Retrieved on March 6, 2011. the New York Herald, the Philadelphia North American, and Forest and Stream.McIver, p. 158. The warden's wife and two young children were given a home in Key West, paid for by donations secured by the Florida Audubon Society. The Society, however, made no effort to replace Bradley, and his job as warden went unfilled.McIver, pp. 162-163. Bradley's obituary, written by William Dutcher and published in August 1905's edition of Bird Lore, characterized him as \\"fearless and brave.\\"Dutcher, William. \\"Guy M. Bradley\\". Bird Lore, vol. 7 (1905). p. 218. Dutcher eulogized Bradley by saying, \\"A faithful and devoted warden, who was a young and sturdy man, cut off in a moment, for what? That a few more plume birds might be secured to adorn heartless women's bonnets. Heretofore the price has been the life of the birds, now is added human blood. Every great movement must have its martyrs, and Guy M. Bradley is the first martyr in bird protection.\\" With no one to replace Bradley, lawlessness continued in the Everglades and rookeries were devastated for several more years. Frank Chapman remarked that \\"There is no community sufficiently law-abiding to leave a bank vault unmolested if it were left unprotected. We have given up. We can't protect it, and the rookery will have to go.\\"Grunwald, p. 127. In November 1908, game warden and deputy sheriff of DeSoto County, Columbus G. McLeod, went missing near Charlotte Harbor. A month later, his boat was found weighted down and sunk; inside, police found the warden's bloodstained hat, long gashes cut into the crown with what appeared to be an axe. It was suspected that he was killed by poachers.McIver, p. 163 His body was never found and the perpetrators were not caught,Wilbanks, pp. 92-93. despite the offer of a $100.00 reward by Florida's Governor Albert W. Gilchrist. Later that year, an employee of the South Carolina Audubon Society, Pressly Reeves, was shot and killed during an ambush by unknown assailants.McIver, p. 164. Legacy These three deaths within as many years helped end the commercial trade of feathers from Florida.Tebeau, p. 170. In 1910, the New York legislature passed the Audubon Plumage Act, outlawing the plume trade; other states followed, and Congress soon banned the import of hats decorated with bird feathers.Huffstodt, pp. 46-47. In time, the fashion craze for bird feathers faded. As the demand for plumage dwindled, thousands of birds returned to the Everglades rookeries; adventure writer Zane Grey wrote after visiting a creek near Cape Sable: A monument commemorating Bradley was dedicated by the Florida Audubon Society (shown here in 1957), but was washed away by a hurricane in 1960. Bradley was buried on a shell ridge at Cape Sable, overlooking Florida Bay. A nearby monument was erected by the Florida Audubon Society, reading: \\"Guy M. Bradley, 1870-1905, Faithful Unto Death, As Game Warden of Monroe County He Gave his Life for the Cause to Which He Was Pledged\\".McIver, p. 167. The grave and monument, however, were later washed away in 1960's Hurricane Donna.Wilbanks, p. 83. The original gravestone was recovered, and is now on display at the Flamingo Visitor Center. A nearby plaque was also dedicated to Bradley's memory, and reads: \\"Audubon warden was shot and killed off this shore by outlaw feather hunters, July 8, 1905. His martyrdom created nationwide indignation, strengthened bird protection laws and helped bring Everglades National Park into being.\\"Hammer, p. 73. The story of Bradley's defense of the Everglades' birds, and the manner of his death, has been depicted in both literature and film. Author Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who would later become famous for publicizing the need for conserving and restoring the Everglades, based the hero of her 1930 short story \\"Plumes\\" on Bradley.Stoneman Douglas, Marjory and Kevin M. McCarthy. Nine Florida Stories by Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Jacksonville: University of North Florida Press, 1990. The 1958 film Wind Across the Everglades, starring Christopher Plummer and Burl Ives, was loosely based upon Bradley's life and death. Author Harvey Eugene Oyer III featured Guy Bradley and Charlie W. Pierce in \\"The Adventures of Charlie Pierce: The Last Egret\\". Middle Rover Press, 2010.

Construction Able was laid down on 23 March 1989, at McDermott Shipyard, in Morgan City, Louisiana. Launched on 16 February 1991; sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy E. Thompson, wife of Rear Adm. William Thompson (Ret.); and placed in service with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) on 22 July 1992. Able is an MSC-manned ocean surveillance ship that uses surveillance towed-array sensor system equipment to gather underwater acoustical data. The command operates the ship as part of its Special Mission Ships Program, using her to support the antisubmarine warfare mission of the commanders of the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. In addition, Able carries electronic equipment to process and transmit that data via satellites to shore stations for evaluation. She is built on a small-waterplane, twin-hull design for greater stability at slow speeds in high latitudes under adverse weather conditions. She deploys primarily to the Western Pacific. In August 2004, Able was taken out of service and laid up in the Reserve Fleet at the Naval Sea Systems Command’s Inactive Ships On-site Maintenance Office at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The service reactivated the ship in 2007, and transferred her to a commercial shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina, where she was converted for AN/UQQ-2 Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS) low frequency active-array capabilities. Able completed her conversion and reactivation the following year after steaming to the West Coast, and then deployed again to the Western Pacific.

Ukrainian folk painting, 19th century Antisemitism in Ukraine has been a historical issue in the country, but it became even more widespread in the twentieth century. A third of the Jews of Europe previously lived in Ukraine between 1791 and 1917, within the Pale of Settlement. The large concentration of Jews in this region historically made them an easy target for anti-Jewish actions and pogroms. Before 20th century Early 20th century =Pogroms during the Russian Revolution of 1905= Victims of the Ekaterinoslav pogrom, October 1905. After the publication of the October Manifesto, which promised citizens of Russia civil rights, many Jews who lived in the cities of the Pale of Settlement, went to the demonstrations against the government. For the local residents acting on the side of the incumbent authorities, this was the pretext to start a new wave of pogroms against Jews. In February 1905, a pogrom took place in Feodosia, on April 19 of the same year a pogrom occurred in Melitopol.https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/melitopol The pogrom in May in Zhytomyr surpassed the rest of the pogroms in terms of the number of victims. The most serious pogrom occurred in Odessa. 300 Jews were killed and thousands injured. Another serious pogrom occurred in Ekaterinoslav, during which 120 Jews were killed. Pogroms occurred in 64 cities (Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Kiev, Simferopol, Romny, Kremenchug, Nikolaev, Chernigov, Kamenets-Podolsky and Elisavetgrad) and in 626 villages. Approximately 660 pogroms occurred in Ukraine and in Bessarabia. The pogroms lasted several days. Participants in the pogroms were workers of trains, traders of local shops, artisans and industrialists. The pogroms of 1903-1906 marked the beginning of the Jewish unification in Europe. They became the motive for the organization of Jewish self-defense, accelerated emigration to Israel, and initiated the HaShomer organization in Israel. The activities of the Union of Russian People and of other Black Hundreds organizations nurtured antisemitism in Ukraine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. =Russian Civil War= Jewish corpses after a pogrom in Ovruch, February 1919. When the Tsentralna Rada proclaimed the III Universal in November 1917, the Imperial Russian Army initiated a pogrom in Uman in central Ukraine. In February 1919 a brigade of UNR troops killed 1500 Jews in Proskurov. In Tetiev on March 25, 1919, Cossack troops under the command of Colonels Cherkovsky, Kurovsky and Shliatoshenko murdered 4000 Jews.M. I. Midlarsky. The killing trap: genocide in the seventeenth century. Cambridge University Press. 2005. p. 46. During the Russian Civil War the Jews of Uman in eastern Podolia were subjected to two pogroms in 1919, as the town changed hands several times. The first pogrom, in spring, claimed 170 victims; the second one, in summer, more than 90. This time the Christian inhabitants helped to hide the Jews. The Council for Public Peace, with a Christian majority and a Jewish minority, saved the city from danger several times. In 1920, for example, it stopped the pogrom initiated by the troops of General Denikin.Encyclopaedia Judaica, second edition, vol. 20, p. 244 During the Russian Civil War, between 1918 and 1921 a total of 1,236 violent incidents against Jews occurred in 524 towns in Ukraine.

When the Directorate replaced Skoropadsky's government, pogroms once again erupted.Сергійчук, Володимир. Симон Петлюра і єврейство.

Kyiv: Tarash Shevchenko National University; 2006. 152 pp: p 90-97]  Directorate of Ukraine (1918–1920)  In December 1918 Hetman of the Ukrainian State Hetmanate, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, was deposed and the Directorate (also called the Directoria) was established as the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic (Ukrayins'ka Narodnia Respublika, abbreviated UNR).Orest Subtelny, Ukraine: A History, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1988, This new Ukrainian government immediately reacted to the acts of violence which happened in January 1919 in Zhytomyr and Berdychiv. The Ukrainian government informed the Jewish leaders and the government of Berdychiv on January 10 that the instigators had been shot, and that the army squadron which took part in the action had been disbanded. The head of the government, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, stated that the pogrom actions were initiated by the Black Hundreds. He also stated: \\"the Ukrainian government will actively fight anti-Semitism and all occurrences of Bolshevism\\". The pro- Bolshevik delegate of the Bund, Moisei Rafes, who initially stated that “the special detachment that was sent to Zhytomyr and Berdychev to fight the Soviets initiated a pogrom”, later in a speech at the meeting of the Labour Congress of Ukraine on January 16, 1919, changed his mind: \\"The Directoria states that it is not to blame, that it is not to blame for the pogroms. None of us blames the Directoria for the responsibility of the pogroms.\\" Symon Petliura made attempts to stop the occurrence of pogroms among Ukrainian detachments. When he discovered from the Minister of Jewish affairs of the UNR that the transiting squadron at the Yareska station had initiated violent acts against the Jewish population, he immediately sent a telegram to the military commandant of Myrhorod: “I command that the matter be investigated and reported back to me, and to use immediate measures so that similar excesses do not have a place and will be punished – 28 January – Head Otaman S. Petliura. When Petliura took charge of the Directoria in 1919, at his initiative the government investigated the Jewish pogroms in Kamianets-Podilskyi and Proskuriv, demanding that the commanders “use decisive actions to totally liquidate the pogromist anti-Jewish actions, and the perpetrators are to be brought before a military tribunal and punished according to the military laws of war”. A representative of the Jewish party Poale Zion, Drakhler, told Petliura: “We understand, having enough facts, that the Zhytomyr and Berdichev pogroms took place as acts against the (Ukrainian) government. Immediately after the Zhytomyr pogrom the Russian and Polish Black Hundred members boasted 'The planned pogroms had worked extremely well, and will bring an end to Ukrainian aspirations'”. Drakhler continued: “I am deeply convinced that not only we, but all Jewish democracy in its activities will take active participation in the struggle to free Ukraine. And in the rows of the army the Jewish Cossack hand in hand will fight, carrying its blood and life onto the altar of national and social freedom in Ukraine”. Petliura replied to the Jewish delegates that he would use \\"the strength of all my authority to remove the excesses against the Jews, which are obstacles to our work of establishing our statehood\\". One document states in reference to the Kiev pogroms of June–October 1919: \\"When General Dragomirov, known for his liberalism, had to leave Kiev because of the Bolshevik offensive, turned to his officers (recorded in a stenogram) with the following words: 'My friends, you know, as much as I do, the reasons for our temporary failures on the Kievan front. When you, my heroic and never dying eagles, retake Kiev, I grant you the possibility to take revenge on the grubby Jews.'\\" When Denikin's Volunteer army () it inflicted robbery and murder on the civilian population. Over 20,000 people died in two days of violence. After these events, the representative of the Kharkiv Jewish Community, Mr. Suprasskin, spoke to General Shkuro, who stated to him bluntly: \\"Jews will not receive any mercy because they are all Bolsheviks.\\" In 1921 Ze'ev (Vladimir) Jabotinsky, the father of Revisionist Zionism, signed an agreement with Maxim Slavinsky, Petliura's representative in Prague, regarding the formation of a Jewish gendarmerie which would accompany Petliura's putative invasion of Ukraine and protect the Jewish population from pogroms. The agreement did not materialize and most Zionist groups heavily criticized Jabotinsky. Nevertheless, he stood by the agreement and took pride in it.Shmuel Katz, Lone Wolf, Barricade Books, New York, 1996, Vol. 1.Israel Kleiner, From Nationalism to Universalism: Vladimir (Ze'ev) Jabotinsky and the Ukrainian Question, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Study Press, 2000.Joseph B.

Middle 20th century  =World War II= Zborov, Western Ukraine, 1941 Operation Barbarossa of 1941 brought together native Ukrainian populations of both, Soviet Ukraine and the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, under the German administrative control of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine to the north-east, and the General Government to the south-west. Many historians argue that the destruction of the Jewish population of Ukraine, reduced from 870,000 to 17,000, could not have been accomplished without the aid of the local population, because the Germans lacked the manpower to reach all of the communities that were annihilated, especially in the remote villages. The nationalist OUN-Bandera faction of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army \\"openly advocated violence against Jews\\", wrote Jeffrey Burds. In August 1941 at its Second Congress in Kraków OUN-B embraced anti-Semitism. \\"Twenty so-called 'foreign' nationalities were listed as enemies of Ukraine: Jews were first, Poles were second.\\" The resolution stated: \\"OUN combats the Jews as the prop of the Muscovite-Bolshevik regime.\\" On September 1, 1941, Ukrainian language newspaper Volhyn wrote: \\"The element that settled our cities (Jews)... must disappear completely from our cities. The Jewish problem is already in the process of being solved.\\"NAAF Holocaust Timeline Project: September 1, 1941, Ukraine. The Lviv pogroms were two massacres of Jews that took place from 30 June to 2 July and 25–29 July 1941 during Operation Barbarossa. According to Yad Vashem six thousand Jews were killed primarily by rioting Ukrainian nationalists and a newly formed Ukrainian militia. The pretext for the pogrom was a rumor that the Jews were responsible for the execution of prisoners by the Soviets before their withdrawal from Lviv.The Lemberg Mosaic, Jakob Weiss, Alderbrook Press, New York (2011) Ukrainian nationalists assisted German Security Police and the Einsatzgruppen. They compiled lists of targets for the branch offices of the KdS and assisted with the roundups (as in Stanisławów, Włodzimierz Wołyński, Łuck), as well as in Zhytomyr, Rivne and Kiev among other locations.I.K.

The organisation claims few antisemitic incidents were recorded during this period. According to Eduard Dolinsky, executive director of the Kiev-based Ukrainian Jewish Committee, Ukrainian Jews overwhelmly supported the 2014 Euromaidan, however, its aftermath led to the raise of anti-semitism and social acceptance of previously marginal far-right groups, together with government's policy of historical negationism in regard to the WWII ethnic cleansing committed by the Ukrainian nationalist movement against the country's minorities.NY Times: What Ukraine's Jews Fear? After the revolution Ukrainian Jews making aliyah from Ukraine reached 142% higher during the first four months of 2014 compared to the previous year. 800 people arrived in Israel over January–April, and over 200 signed up for May 2014. Also at least 100 Jews left the country and went to Israel assisted by the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4774002,00.html In April 2014, a leaflet was handed out to the Jewish community in the city Donetsk as if by the pro-Russian separatists who had taken over control of the city. The leaflet contained an order to every Jew over the age of 16 to register as a Jew, and also to declare all the property they own, or else have their citizenship revoked, face deportation and see their assets confiscated, ostensibly as retribution for being Ukrainian loyalists. Denis Pushilin, head of the pro-Russian separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said it was a fake that was meant to discredit his movement. Donetsk Chief Rabbi Pinchas Vishedski also claims it was a hoax, and said that \\"Anti-Semitic incidents in the Russian-speaking east were rare, unlike in Kiev and western Ukraine\\".http://www.jpost.com/International/Ukraine-rabbi-calls-anti-semitic- leaflet-a-political-hoax-349932 An April 2014 listing of anti-Jewish violence in Ukraine in Haaretz no incidents outside this \\"Russian-speaking east\\" were mentioned.Ukrainian Jews look to Israel as anti-Semitism escalates There were also cases of exploitation of anti-Semitism and “the Jewish question” in propaganda campaigns, such as speculations used by the administration of President Viktor Yanukovych in the first (November 2013) days of the Euromaidan mass protests. The conclusion of the (earlier mentioned) National Minority Rights Monitoring Group report describes a peak of antisemitic incidents in 2014, probably due to the instabilily in Ukraine. In March 2014, Yaakov Bleich, the Chief Rabbi of Ukraine, accused Russian sympathizers and nationalists of staging antisemitic provocations to be blamed on Ukrainians. He claimed that these provocations were used by the Russian Federation to justify its 2014 invasion of Crimea.

It allows the teachers to focus on supporting students at their own pace instead of making every student learn in a standardized fashion. All these practices hope to propel students to \\"permanent learning\\". Woogi World's learning platform is broken down into three fundamental components: * Philosophy * Methodology * Technology  Philosophy  There are four main goals of Woogi learning. # Depth: Woogi World attempts to take students to deeper understandings and away from superficial awareness. # Breadth: Supplying each student with what they need to succeed in which subjects they excel at. # Permanent Memory: Ensure students retain the knowledge they earn. # Real Life Application: Applying lessons to the outside world and making a positive difference.  Methodology  Woogi World employs tactics known as \\"The 4C's\\" to teach children.Woogi Academy Learning Platform # Curriculum: Every lesson in Woogi World starts with a review and a student submitted study log. Then the core instruction takes lac which is followed by an exercise to help the student practice. Later an assessment is completed to gauge how the student is progressing and to help guide their learning in following lessons. A 100% \\"confidence quotient\\" in a subject should be analogous to at least a 70% on any assessment in that same subject according to Woogi World. # Clubs: Every subject has a corresponding club for students who show increased aptitude or interest in that particular subject. These clubs are headed by \\"gurus\\" who are available for one-on-one tutoring and any questions that are on hand. Students participate in activities that get progressively harder, gaining influence in the club and accruing rewards as they climb higher. # Coaching: Instruction with other students and actual teachers in real time using video chat and other media devices to bring the classroom experience to the virtual world. # Community: Using the Woogi Worlds social media platform to encourage learning through collaboration with other youths and not just through formal instruction with the website or a teacher.

It is directed by The Butcher Brothers, also known as Mitchell Altieri and Phil Flores. April Fool's Day is described by star Scout Taylor-Compton as \\"Mean Girls crossed with horror\\", and was released straight to DVD on March 25, 2008. The film received negative reviews from critics and fans. Plot On April 1, 2007, Desiree Cartier is hosting a party at her mansion for her actress friend Torrance Caldwell. Present for a pre-festivities toast are—Blaine Cartier, Desiree's brother, who controls their joint inheritance (to Desiree's dislike), U.S. Senate candidate Peter Welling, Peter's \\"Miss Carolina\\" fiancée Barbie Reynolds, and the quintet's less wealthy videographer friend Ryan. With the party in full swing, Desiree's social nemesis and Ryan's not-so-secret crush Milan Hastings, arrives. Also present is chihuahua-toting society reporter Charles. As another in her long string of April Fool's pranks, Desiree suggests Blaine get Milan tipsy on champagne and seduce her in his bedroom upstairs. Desiree and several of the others hover by the cracked-open bedroom door, prepared to videotape the affair with the camera Desiree lifted from Ryan. However, Milan has a seizure and falls off the balcony to her death. The group goes to court, and Blaine loses control of the family's fortune, which shifts to Desiree, but they are considered innocent and Milan's death is considered a fatal prank. One year later, Desiree, Blaine, Peter, Barbie, Torrance, and Ryan receive anonymous invitations to meet on Milan's grave at noon, April 1, 2008, with the cryptic P.S. \\"I have proof.\\" Just after the entire sextet is back together, a messenger comes to the grave with a box containing a letter and a laptop computer. The letter says one of the six murdered Milan, and if that person does not confess, all of them will be dead by midnight. As a show of intent, the computer has footage of Charles drowning in his pool. Everyone goes from the cemetery to the pool to confirm this mishap. Subsequently, an increasingly frantic Desiree sees one \\"suspect\\" after another \\"murdered\\" before her eyes (though the bodies keep disappearing). Barbie is electrocuted in a beauty pageant dressing room, Peter's campaign truck runs him down in a parking garage, Ryan's throat is slit in his humble apartment, and returning home, Desiree and Blaine discover even their long-time butler Wilford has been butchered in the kitchen. After a brief separation from her brother, Desiree finds him tied to a chair. Worse yet, gun-wielding Torrance soon has Desiree tied inches away in another chair. After some back and forth, and Torrance fatally shooting Blaine in the chest, a chagrined Desiree finally admits it was she who spiked Milan's fatal drink, while allowing brother Blaine to become the \\"fall guy.\\" At this point Blaine cannot contain a chuckle, and soon the whole crew of 2008 \\"victims\\" are surrounding a still-tied Desiree, telling her what a bitch she is, and how they have conspired to prove it to her. Special effects people from Torrance's Boogie Nights 2 set have equipped Blaine and the others with \\"squibs,\\" and other cast members faked Desiree out by dressing as cops and \\"confirming\\" Ryan's murder as she and her brother were fleeing the scene. To illustrate her end of the charade involving a revolver shooting blanks, Torrance pulls the trigger once more. Unfortunately for Desiree, this time the cartridge in the chamber is real, and the bullet blows off the top of her head. The next scene involves the same inquest-probate judge from a year earlier absolving Torrance of any guilt for Desiree's death, and confirming Blaine as sole heir of the family estate. The final scene shows Blaine driving off in what was Desiree's red Mercedes, a slowly building smirk on his face. Cast Production April Fool's Day was directed by The Butcher Brothers, and the two also re-wrote the script for the remake with Mikey Wigart. Picked up by Stage 6 Films for distribution, it was filmed in North Carolina under producers Tara L. Craig and Frank Mancuso Jr.. Mancuso had also produced the original. Scout Taylor-Compton noted that the filmmakers planned to make April Fool's Day an R-rated film. The film would retain most of the original's humor; however, Flores said it is \\"pretty much contemporized, with off-beat humor, different settings  something that would gel with today's audience.\\" Altieri noted that \\"It's kind of more a twisting and turning story\\" with \\"some really good scares\\".

During the filming of an unnamed picture, Linda suspects the film's director, Garboil (no first name given), of being a Nazi spy or at the very least an American Bund member. In order to follow him and gain corroborating evidence, she disguises herself in a backless blue blouse, red shorts, blue flared gloves, red buccaneer boots and a blue opera mask and calls herself the Black Cat.Pocket Comics #1 (Aug. 1941). While following Garboil, Black Cat meets Rick Horne, a reporter for the Los Angeles Globe who has been assigned to investigate rumors of a Nazi spy ring in LA. Initially disdainful of each other, the pair are forced to work together and discover that Garboil is planting secret information in his motion pictures. Using her knowledge of the studio, Black Cat sneaks into the editing room and changes the edit of the picture to render the information useless. When they are discovered, Rick and Cat physically overpower the gang and turn them in. Garboil escapes and Linda decides to maintain her Black Cat identity in order to keep watch over his activities. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"Most of the Black Cat's opponents are ordinary criminals and Axis agents, but she does fight a female Mad Scientist, the criminal brothers known as the Three Black Cats, a vampire, and after the war Russians in Afghanistan.\\" In 1944, The Black Cat's costume was modified slightly, becoming a one piece blue bathing suit with buccaneer boots, flared gloves and opera mask, all in blue, and a red belt.

Her father was silent film western actor Tim Turner and her unnamed mother was a stunt woman, having appeared at least once in a jungle girl picture or serial, probably in the early thirties. By her late teens, Linda became a professional stunt woman and won some acclaim for her work. Her natural beauty gained her a screen test and her innate acting ability led to acting jobs, eventually to starring roles. Her acting roles have ranged from period dramas and romantic melodramas to action heroines, where her history as a stunt woman allows her to do some of her own stunts. That same history as a stunt woman, plus life on her father's ranch outside of Los Angeles, gave Linda the physical skills to perform her work as The Black Cat. Linda is adept at riding a horse and a motorcycle, as well as performing stunts on the vehicle. She is proficient with a lasso and rope, and possesses a black belt in judo. Her stunt training also allows her to make impressive leaps from buildings or moving vehicles safely.Black Cat #63 (Oct. 1962) and others. =Rick Horne= Rick Horne is a reporter and love interest of Linda Turner. Initially Horne is employed as a reporter for the Los Angeles Globe. In later appearances, he works for a Hollywood trade paper as a columnist. Near the end of the series, Horne also had a radio broadcast, in much the same manner of Walter Winchell, where he broadcast news and entertainment interviews. Horne is aggressive and seemingly fearless, often using his fists to escape hazardous situations or to subdue criminals. Though his fighting prowess is surpassed by The Black Cat, he is often a help to her. Horne was mistrustful of Black Cat at first and denigrated her efforts to bring Garboil to justice. However, as they worked together more and more, Horne was impressed with Black Cat's ability and began to view her as an efficient force against crime and an attractive fantasy woman. At the same time, Horne struck up a casual friendship with Linda Turner without realizing she is also The Black Cat. Their relationship grew over the years, to the point where the two began to date and maintained a tenuous commitment to each other. But Horne is more attracted to the mysterious fantasy of The Black Cat than to the glamorous Linda Turner, and Linda seems determined to keep the reporter at arm's length until he commits to her rather than his fantasy woman, even though both are the same woman. =Toby= Toby is Linda Turner's pet cat. Toby was usually portrayed as a black Siamese. Toby was usually depicted as a male, though one story identified the cat as female.“The Queen of Cats”, Black Cat #8 (Oct./Nov. 1947). It is possible that Linda had two cats, both named Toby, at different stages of her life. In Toby's initial appearances, the cat displayed an antagonistic dislike for Garboil, Linda's director on her films. In at least one story“The Case Of The Photo Crimes”, Speed Comics #27 (July 1943). Toby was drawn by artist Bob Powell as a white Angora. After changing to Black Cat, Linda worked a skin tight black cat skin over the white cat and, in disguise, Toby assisted Black Cat in tracking down the villain of the story. =Garboil= Garboil is the studio contract director Linda initially works with. He is of German descent and speaks with a thick German accent. It isn't known whether Linda initially suspects him of being a spy because of his activities or his ethnic heritage, but her suspicions are proven to be well-founded. He is cold and superior in his dealings with others, and has a disdain for Linda's cat. Garboil was the only recurring villain in Black Cat’s history. The character disappeared after a few appearances. =Tim Turner= Linda's father is introduced in 1946, after Black Cat gains her own title. A former cowboy who gained stardom as a western hero during the silent movie days, Tim Turner retired from films sometime after the death of his stunt woman wife, Linda's mother. The elderly Turner lives primarily on his own on a ranch outside of Los Angeles. He has an affectionate relationship with his daughter, who he knows is The Black Cat, and occasionally advises her on her cases. It was Turner who taught his daughter how to ride and rope, skills she later translated into her stunt work. Though he is concerned for his daughter's safety, Tim Turner wholly approves of her activities as The Black Cat and her desire to bring justice to the world. Turner also dabbled after his film career as a private detective, but it’s unknown whether he was successful at it. He did teach some of his investigative skills to his daughter. =Jonesie= Jonesie is Linda Turner's personal secretary. The slim blonde with the large black horn-rimmed glasses handles Linda's fan-mail and schedule, acts as a liaison with the studio Linda is contracted to and occasionally is a sympathetic ear to Linda when she pondered her curious relationship with Rick Horne. =Kit Weston= Kit Weston was introduced in Black Cat #28.\\"Flames Over Hollywood\\", Black Cat #28 (Apr. 1951). The thirteen-year-old boy was a circus aerialist, part of the act The Flying Westons. During a performance, the tent is engulfed in flames by the super-criminal The Fire Bug. The Black Cat saves Kit when he’s trapped by the fire on a trapeze platform. However, Kit’s parents are killed in the blaze. Linda Turner volunteers shelter to the orphan until relatives can be found. Later, in order to cheer the despondent youth, Linda appears to him as Black Cat and takes him with her as she trails The Fire Bug. Black Cat corners the villain at the municipal museum and, with Kit’s aid, defeats him. The Fire Bug is revealed to be Orson Arson, a former special effects wizard at Century Studio. While Linda and Tim debated what to do with Kit, the boy managed through a combination of youthful bravado and his aerialist skills to foil a burglar he caught in the Turner home. Impressed by his skill and energy, Linda takes him into her confidence and reveals her second identity to him. Kit is given a blue unitard with red trunks and a blue cowl with cat’s ears, and assists Black Cat in her last two adventures as “Black Kitten”.

After the First World War, during the British period, Raghib al-Nashashibi was Mayor of Jerusalem (1920–1934). A branch of the family, Al Hassani, are reputed to have moved to Damascus in Syria; another minor branch, the Akattan, is presumed to have been established in Turkey of the offspring of a major Nashashibi Ottoman officer who withdrew to Turkey after the First World War and the fall of Palestine from Ottoman rule. Little is known about the whereabouts in Egypt of the presumed source of the family. History =Mamluk and Ottoman periods= The Nashashibis are reportedly of Kurdish, Turkmen or Arab origin (as their name being the equivalent of fletcher in English may indicate). They first became notable and prominent in Jerusalem with the advent of Prince (of the army) Nasser al-Din al-Nashashibi who migrated (or led a military contingent?) to Jerusalem from Egypt in 1469 CE. He was chosen to guard and be the custodian of al-Haram ash- Sharif (the two Sacred Shrines): the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Cave of the Patriarchs (the Al-Ibrahimi Mosque) in Hebron. Nasser al-Din is also credited with being the first official to bring \\"piped\\" and channelled water to Jerusalem from the Bethlehem (Al Khader) area. A gate to the esplanade of the Jerusalem Haram is named after him. The family became one of the prominent Muslim families of Jerusalem as landowners, merchants, public/government officials and later as professionals. As a family of \\"notables\\" in Jerusalem a prominent elder of the family, Rashid Nashashibi, was one of two people chosen to represent Jerusalem in the Ottoman Majlis in c. 1910. Despite their relatively favoured position with the Ottomans, some members of the family took part in the struggle against the Ottoman regime. The outstanding member of the family who opposed Ottoman rule and was executed for his pan-Arab nationalist agitation and advocacy was Ali Omar Nashashibi (also referred in some history books as Bitar Ali, bitar meaning veterinarian), who had been a commissioned veterinary doctor and officer in the Ottoman army and a founder of one of the earliest pan-Arab nationalist movements, the Kahtani Society. Ali Omar was executed by Djemal Pasha in Beirut at the Sahet Al-Shuhada (Place des Martyres) in 1917 for conspiracy and political agitation within the Ottoman Army. =British Mandate period= Nashashibi family, 1929. Raghib al- Nashashibi standing above the bride The Nashashibi family had a strong influence in Palestinian affairs during the British Mandate period, from 1920 until 1948. During this period, they competed with the al-Husayni clan, another prominent Arab Jerusalem family, for leadership of Palestinian Arab political affairs. The views of these two families largely shaped the divergent political stances of Palestinian Arabs at the time. Another influential family was the Khalidi. Raghib Nashashibi, the head of the Nashashibi clan at the time, was an influential political figure throughout the British Mandate period, and beyond. He was appointed Mayor of Jerusalem in 1920 by the British, and helped form the Palestinian Arab National Party in 1928 and the National Defence Party in 1934.http://www.answers.com/topic/nashashibi-family In 1936, he joined to the Arab Higher Committee, formed on the initiative of Amin al-Husayni, of the rival al-Husayni clan; however, Raghib and the clan-controlled National Defence Party soon withdrew from the Committee. The 1936-39 Arab revolt was sparked by opposition to Jewish immigration, which had greatly increased due to anti-Semitism in Europe. Members of the Nashashibi family began to be targeted, as well as the Jewish community and British administrators. Raghib Nashashibi was forced to flee to Egypt after several assassination attempts on him, which were ordered by the mufti, Amin al-Husayni.Smith, Charles. Palestine and Arab-Israeli Conflict. Sixth Edition. 2007. p.111-225. Raghib’s nephew, Fakhri Nashashibi helped organize forces known as “peace bands” to fight insurgents and give information to the British. Following the assassination of the Acting British District Commissioner of Galilee, Lewis Yelland Andrews, on 26 September 1937, the British outlawed the Arab Higher Committee,Sayigh, 2000, p. 8. arrested its members and ordered nationalist political parties to dissolve.A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. Reprinted 1991 by The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington. Volume II. . p.949 Raghib al-Nashashibi and the National Defence Party was not subject to the ban. Many of the other political figures were either arrested, deported or went into exile. Views The Nashashibi family was considered to be politically moderate compared to the more militant views of the Husayni family. The Nashashibis favoured political, rather than violent, opposition to the British Mandate and Zionism.Smith, Charles. Palestine and Arab-Israeli Conflict. Sixth Edition. 2007. p.111-225. They were also willing to compromise in some areas that many Palestinians were not. For example, the Nashashibi family favoured the partition proposed by Britain in 1937 and reservedly accepted the 1939 White Paper, though they backtracked when attacked by political opponents. Similarly, the Nashashibi also favoured Arab participation in the Legislative Council proposed by the British Mandate, which would feature representatives of the various religious groups in Palestine at the time. Generally, the Nashashibi family and their political followers advocated compromise with Zionists and the British authorities. This fell in stark contrast to the views of the Husaynis, who advocated a total rejection of the Balfour Declaration policy.http://www.answers.com/topic/nashashibi-family The Palestine Arab Party, formed in 1935 by the Husayni’s in response to the formation of Nashashibi’s National Defense Party, believed in the maximalist programme of dissolution of the Jewish National Home and creation of a solely Arab government.Smith, Charles. Palestine and Arab-Israeli Conflict. Sixth Edition. 2007. The Nashashibis, however, felt that Arabs were most likely to achieve their political goals by working within the Mandate system, rather than fighting against it.Palestinian Arab and Jewish Leadership in the Mandate Period =Husayni-Nashashibi rivalry= Throughout the British mandate period, the Husayni and Nashashibi clans were the two most powerful Arab families in Palestine and they constantly competed for power. While the two families did not differ on their long-term goals (stopping the influx of European Jews and preserving the Arab Palestinian state), they disagreed on the best way to achieve those goals. The Husayni family rejected the British mandate and Zionism as a whole, while the Nashashibis felt that the best approach was through political compromise. Politics in Palestine as a whole largely diverged along the rift created by these two families. This produced a level of factionalism among Palestinian Arabs that often crippled them in fighting Zionism. Additionally, partisan bickering often resulted in one family blocking the policies of the other family that genuinely may have been in the national interest. Unfortunately for Palestinian Arabs, their ability to effectively negotiate was often hindered by their inability to present a united front on the issue of Zionism. On the rivalry, an editorial in the Arabic-language Falastin newspaper in the 1920s commented: Family since 1948 In 1947, the United Nations voted in favour of the partition of Palestine, which Arab leaders rejected. A conflict was to erupt that would decide that the Zionists, with their superior leadership, training and arms received in World War II, would gain the partition and independent state they desired in Palestine.Smith, Charles. Palestine and Arab-Israeli Conflict. Sixth Edition. 2007. p.199. However, during the time before the proclamation of the Jewish State, other Arab states staked their interest in helping the Palestinian Arabs. Egypt came to the aid of the Husayni mufti, and the Nashashibi clan supported King Abdullah of Jordan. Despite outside aid, events such as that at Dayr Yasin caused an Arab exodus, and the situation turned in favor of the Zionists. The proclamation of the state of Israel was made in May 1948. Following Israeli statehood in May 1948, the mufti attempted to form from Egypt the All Palestine Government in Gaza, but Abdullah of Jordan prevented this and annexed the larger remaining Arab area of Palestine (now called the West Bank) to Transjordan, forming the Kingdom of Jordan. After Jordan's takeover of the West Bank, Raghib al-Nashashibi served as a minister in the Jordanian government, governor of the West Bank, member of the Jordanian Senate, and the first military governor of the West Bank in Palestine. The appointment, with the backing by Arab states, other than Egypt, signaled the defeat of the mufti.Smith, Charles. Palestine and Arab-Israeli Conflict. Sixth Edition. 2007. p.207. Currently, members of the clan hold prominent positions in the Palestine National Council and the Palestine Liberation Organization.The Nashashibis Notable members * Raghib al- Nashashibi, member of the Ottoman Majlis for Jerusalem c. 1910 and mayor of Jerusalem, 1920–1934 * Mufid Nashashibi * Rosalind Nashashibi * Sharif Hikmat Nashashibi * Rami Nashashibi  References  Category:Palestinian families Category:Arab people in British Palestine ","title":"Nashashibi clan"},{"id":"13901061","text":"In enzymology, a malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :(S)-malate + NADP+ \\\\rightleftharpoons oxaloacetate + NADPH + H+ Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are oxaloacetate, NADPH, and H+.

It consists of fifteen paintings on nine panels, of which six are painted on both sides. Unusually for the period, it retains some of its original frames. Six of the outer panels (or shutters) have hinges for folding; when closed the exterior view of saints and donors is visible. The inner panels contain scenes from the Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large central panel spans both registers and shows Christ seated on a rainbow in judgement, while below him, the Archangel Michael holds scales to weigh souls. The lower register panels form a continuous landscape, with the panel on the far proper right showing the gates of Heaven, while the entrance to Hell is on the far proper left. Between these, the dead rise from their graves, and are depicted moving from the central panel to their final destinations after receiving judgement. The altarpiece was commissioned in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune in eastern France, by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, and his wife Guigone de Salins, who is buried in front of the altarpiece's original location.Campbell (2004), 78 It is in poor condition; it was moved in the 20th century both to shield it against sunlight and protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors the hospice receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated to be displayed; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays. Commission and hospice Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years.Smith (1981), 276 His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune.Vaughan (2012), 169 It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague had decimated the population between 1438 and 1440.Blum (1969), 37 Furthermore, in 1435, when the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, Beaune suffered first the ravages of marauding bands of , who roamed the countryside scavenging in the late 1430s and early 1440s, then an ensuing famine.Vaughan (2012), 94 The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and was consecrated on 31 December 1452. At the same time, Rolin established the religious order of the . He dedicated the hospice to Anthony the Great, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages.Hayum (1977), 508 Courtyard of the Hôtel-Dieu Rolin declared in the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, that \\"in the interest of my salvation ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\"Smith (2004), 91Lane (1989), 168 In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily.Lane (1989), 169 Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a primary role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470. Documents relating to the altarpiece’s commission survive, with the artist, patron, date of completion and place of installation all known – unusual for a Netherlandish altarpiece. It was intended as the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached Rogier van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was ready by 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated.Lane (1989), 167 Painted in van der Weyden's Brussels workshop – most likely with the aid of apprentices – the panels were transported to the hospice once completed.Jacobs (1991), 60; Lane (1989), 167 The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, at which time it was positioned on the high altar.Campbell (2004), 74 Patients of the Hotel-Dieu in their Beds, folio 77, 1482, Livre de vie active, by Jehan Henry, shows nurses attending the dying in a Paris hospital. Patients are two to a bed, except for a dying woman. The polyptych was intended to provide both comfort and warning to the dying; acting as a reminder of their faith and directing their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning within view of the patients' beds. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.Lane (1989), 171–72 For those too ill to walk, Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed within sight of the altarpieceHayum (1977), 505 which was visible through a pierced screen.Lane (1989), 177–8 There were usually only two patients per bed, a luxury at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. St Sebastian and St Anthony represent healing. Both were associated with bubonic plague and their inclusion is intended to reassure the dying that they will act as intercessors with the divine.Lane (1989), 170 St Michael developed a cult following in 15th-century France, and he was seen as a guardian of the dead, a crucial role given the prevalence of plague in the region. There was another severe outbreak in 1441–1442, just before Rolin founded the hospital. According to the art historian Barbara Lane, patients were unlikely to survive their stay at Beaune, yet the representation of St Michael offered consolation as they could \\"gaze on his figure immediately above the altar of the chapel every time the altarpiece was opened. Like Saints Anthony and Sebastian on the exterior of the polyptych, the archangel offered ... hope that they would overcome their physical ills.\\"Lane (1989), 180 Description Van der Weyden disregarded division between panels; on the top left the apostle's robes flow onto the adjoining panel, on the bottom left a man is seemingly cut in two, and on the right the tip of angel's trumpet is visible. The altarpiece measures ,Campbell(1980), 64 and comprises fifteen separate paintings across nine panels, six of which are painted on both sides. When the shutters are opened, the viewer is exposed to the expansive \\"Last Judgement\\" interior panels.Blum (1969), 39 These document the possible spiritual fates of the viewers: that they might reach Heaven or Hell, salvation or damnation; stark alternatives appropriate for a hospice.Jacobs (2011), 112 When the outer wings (or shutters) are folded, the exterior paintings (across two upper and four lower panels) are visible.Blum (1969), 39 The exterior panels serve as a funerary monument for the donors. Art historian Lynn Jacobs believes that the \\"dual function of the work accounts for the choice of the theme of the Last Judgement on its interior\\".Jacobs (2011), 112 When the shutters are closed the polyptych resembles the upper portion of a cross.Jacobs (1991), 33–35 The elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene depicting a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels. Van der Weyden conveys the heavenly sphere in the tall vertical panel, whereas the earthly is relegated to the lower-register panels and the exterior view. Moreover, the T-shape echoes typical configurations of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir.Jacobs (1991), 36–37 The imagery of the outer panels is set in the earthly realm with the donors and the saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.Jacobs (1991), 36–37 Hence, the work clearly distinguishes between figures of the divine, earthly and hellish realms.Jacobs (1991), 60–61 =Inner panels= As with van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, the background landscape and arrangements of figures extend across individual panels of the lower register to the extent that the separations between panels are ignored.Jacobs (2011), 97 There are instances of figures painted across two adjoining panels,Jacobs (2011), 98 whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to the iconography.Blum (1969), 43 The celestial sphere, towards which the saved move, is dramatically presented with a \\"radiant gold background, spanning almost the entire width of the altarpiece\\". The lower register presents Earth and contains the gates to Heaven and Hell. The imposing figure of Christ indicates the \\"reign of heaven is about to begin.\\"Jacobs (2011), 60 The distinction between the earthly and heavenly realms creates a sense of order, and Christ \\"exudes calm and control\\", and a sense of balance and movement throughout the panels.Lane (1989), 172 Gislebertus's Last Judgement, west tympanum of Autun Cathedral, 12th century The presentation of the resurrected dead across the five lower panels is reminiscent of a Gothic tympanum, specifically that at Autun Cathedral. Rolin would have been familiar with the Autun Cathedral entrances, which may have influenced his commissioning of a Last Judgement for the hospice. Additionally, Rolin was aware of the liturgy associated with the Mass for the Dead, and would have known Last Judgement scenes associated with the Mass from 15th-century illuminated manuscripts, such as the full-page Last Judgement in the Hours of Catherine of Cleves, which shows Christ in a similar position, seated above the dead as they rise from their graves.Lane (1989), 176–77 Upper register Jesus Christ and the Archangel Michael in judgement. The blessed are to their right, the condemned to their left. Christ sits in judgement in the upper centre panel. He holds a lily in his right hand and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, his feet resting on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of benediction, and his left hand is lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell,Upton (1989), 39 his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, from which pours deep-red blood.McNamee (1998), 181 Christ's face is identical to the representation in the Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452.Blum (1969), 30 Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here he brings a sense of order. The Archangel Michael, as the embodiment and conduit of divine justice, is positioned directly below Christ, the only figure to reach both Heaven and Earth. He wears a dispassionate expression as he holds a set of scales to weigh souls. Unusually for Christian art, the damned outweigh the blessed; Michael's scales have only one soul in each pan, yet the left pan tips below the right. Michael is given unusual prominence in a \\"Last Judgement\\" for the period, and his powerful presence emphasises the work's function in a hospice and its preoccupation with the liturgy of death. His feet are positioned as if he is stepping forward, about to move out of the canvas, and he looks directly at the observer, giving the illusion of judging not only the souls in the painting but also the viewer.Lane (1989), 177 File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Last Judgment (detail) - WGA25634.jpgalt=Painting of two winged figures carrying various implementsAngels holding symbols of the Passion File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Last Judgment (detail) - WGA25645.jpgalt=Painting of several haloed figures against golden clouds with nude figures falling in terror belowDeësis to Christ's left File:Rogier van der Weyden 002.jpgalt=Painting of two winged figures carrying various implementsTwo angels carrying the pillar on which Christ was scourged Michael, like Sebastian and Anthony, was a plague saint and his image would have been visible to patients through the openings of the pierced screen as they lay in their beds.Lane (1989), 178 He is portrayed with iconographic elements associated with the Last Judgement, and, dressed in a red cope with woven golden fabrics over a shining white alb, is by far the most colourful figure in the lower panels, \\"hypnotically attracting the viewer's glance\\" according to Lane. He is surrounded by four cherubs playing trumpets to call the dead to their final destination. Michael's role in the Last Judgement is emphasised through van der Weyden's use of colour: Michael's gleaming white alb contrasts with the cherubs' red vestments, set against a blue sky directly below heaven's golden clouds. Both of the upper register wings contain a pair of angels holding instruments of the Passion. These include a lance, a crown of thorns and a stick with a sponge soaked in vinegar. The angels are dressed in white liturgical vestments, including an alb and an amice. Beneath Michael, souls scurry left and right. The saved walk towards the gates of Heaven where they are greeted by a saint; the damned arrive at the mouth of Hell and fall en masse into damnation. The souls balanced in the scales are naked. The blessed look towards Christ, the banished look downwards. Both groups are tilted in the direction of Christ's hands. Reinforcing this, inscriptions around the groupings read VIRTUTES (Virtues) and PECCATA (sins). Lower register The Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, the twelve Apostles and an assortment of dignitaries are positioned in a Deësis, at either side of Michael. The apostles are seated in a semicircle; St Peter is dressed in red on the far left, and St Paul, dressed in green, is on the far right. The seven haloed dignitaries, dressed in contemporary clothing, are unidentified but include a king, a pope, a bishop, a monk, and three women. Rather than general representative types, they are portraits of specific unidentified individuals, according to Shirley Blum.Blum (1969), 42 The dead rise from their graves around Michael's feet; some emerge to walk towards Heaven, others towards Hell. They are on a dramatically reduced scale compared to the saints. Lorne Campbell notes that the panels indicate a deeply pessimistic view of humanity, with the damned far outnumbering the saved,Campbell (2004), 81 especially compared to Stefan Lochner's Cologne panel, where the saved crowd around the gate to Heaven. The souls undergo a gradual transformation as they move from panel to panel. Those rising from their graves at Michael's feet show little expression, but become more animated as they move to either side; horror and desperation become especially visible on the faces of the damned as they move towards Hell.Jacobs (1991), 98–9 On the left, the saved have, according to Jacobs, \\"the same beatific expressions\\", but their postures gradually change from facing Christ and Michael to looking towards Heaven's gate, most notably with the couple below Mary where the man turns the woman's gaze away from Michael, and towards Heaven. This contrasts with another couple on the opposite panel who face Hell; the woman is hunched over as the man raises his hand in vain to beseech God for mercy.Jacobs (2011), 114 Entrance to Heaven Heaven is represented by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus;Jacobs (1991), 47 the gate to Heaven in this work resembles the entrance to the Beaune hospice.Blum (1969), 46 The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church – the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight.Jacobs (2011), 115 It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.Jacobs (1991), 100 Van der Weyden depicts Hell as a gloomy, crowded place of both close and distant fires, and steep rock faces. The damned tumble helplessly into it, screaming and crying. The sinners enter Hell with heads mostly bowed, dragging each other along as they go.Ridderbos et al. (2005), 35 Traditionally, a Last Judgement painting would depict the damned tormented by malevolent spirits; yet here the souls are left alone, the only evidence of their torment in their expressions. The hellscape is painted so as to instil terror, but without devils.Drees (2000), 501 Erwin Panofsky was the first to mention this absence, and proposed that van der Weyden had opted to convey torment in an inward manner, rather than through elaborate descriptions of devils and fiends. He wrote, \\"The fate of each human being ... inevitably follows from his own past, and the absence of any outside instigator of evil makes us realize that the chief torture of the Damned is not so much physical pain as a perpetual and intolerably sharpened consciousness of their state\\".Panofsky (1953), 270 According to Bernhard Ridderbos, van der Weyden accentuated the theme by \\"restricting the number of the dead and treating them almost as individuals. As the damned approach the abyss of hell they become more and more compressed.\\" =Exterior panels= Detail showing Saints Sebastian and Anthony The six exterior panels consists of two donor wings, two containing saints, and two panels with Gabriel presenting himself to Mary. The donors are on the outer wings, kneeling in front of their prayer books. Four imitation statues in grisaille make up the inner panels. The lower two depict St Sebastian and St Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony the patron saint of skin diseases and ergotism, then known as St Anthony's Fire.Lane (1989), 170–71 The two saints had close associations with the Burgundian court: Philip the Good was born on St Anthony's day, he had an illegitimate son named Anthony, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric Order of the Golden Fleece.Blum (1969), 40–41 The two small upper register panels show a conventional Annunciation scene, with the usual dove representing the Holy Spirit. The two sets of panels, unlike those on the interior, are compositionally very different. The figures occupy distinctly separate niches and the colour schemes of the grisaille saints and the donors contrast sharply. Like many mid-15th century polyptychs, the exterior panels borrow heavily from the Ghent Altarpiece, completed in 1432. The use of grisaille is borrowed from that work, as is the treatment of the Annunciation. Van der Weyden uses iconography in the Beaune exterior that is not found in his other works, suggesting that Rolin may have asked that the altarpiece follow van Eyck's example. Van der Weyden was not inclined merely to imitate though, and arranged the panels and figures in a concentrated and compact format.Campbell (2004), 21 Jacobs writes that \\"the exterior presents the most consistent pictorial rendering of trompe l'oeil sculpture to date\\". Gabriel's scroll and Mary's lily appear to be made of stone; the figures cast shadows against the back of their niches, creating a sense of depth which adds to the illusion. Detail of Nicolas Rolin in prayer, wearing fur-lined black robes. The exterior panels are drab, according to Blum, who writes that on Rolin's panel the most colourful figure is the red angel, which, with its gold helmet and keys, \\"emerges like an apparition\\". Rolin and de Salins can be identified by the coats-of-arms held by the angels; husband and wife kneel at cloth- covered prie-dieux (portable altars) displaying their emblems. Although De Salins was reputedly pious and charitable, and even perhaps the impetus for the building of the hospice, she is placed on the exterior right, traditionally thought of as an inferior position corresponding to Hell, linking her to Eve, original sin and the Fall of man. Detail of Guigone de Salins, who is buried in front of the altarpiece's original location in the hospice. Van Eyck had earlier portrayed Rolin in the 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, and the patron is recognizable from that work; both portraits show similar lips, a large chin and somewhat pointed ears. In van Eyck's portrait, Rolin is presented as perhaps pompous and arrogant; here – ten years later – he appears more thoughtful and concerned with humility.Smith (1981), 273 Campbell notes wryly that van der Weyden may have been able to disguise the sitter's ugliness and age, and that the unusual shape of his mouth may have been downplayed. He writes that while \\"van Eyck impassively recorded, van der Weyden imposed a stylised and highly personal vision of the subject\\". Van Eyck's depiction was most likely the more accurate; van der Weyden embellished, mainly by lengthening the nose, enlarging the eyes and raising the eyebrows.Campbell (2004), 22 Inscriptions The panels contain quotations in Latin from several biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into the edges of the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly on the surface of the central inner panel.Acres (2000), 86–7 The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in white paint are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE MUNDI (\\"Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world\\"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS (\\"Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels\\"). The inscriptions follow the 14th- century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs associated with the saved to Christ's right, and those of the damned to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, to the extent that they are usually difficult to discern in reproduction. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.Acres (2000), 87 Condition A number of the panels are in poor condition, owing variously to darkening of the colours, accumulated dirt and poor decisions during early restorations. The altarpiece stayed in the chapel from the time of its installation until the French Revolution, from which it was hidden in an attic for decades. When it was brought out, the nude souls – thought to be offensive – were painted over with clothing and flames; it was moved to a different room, hung from the ground, and portions were whitewashed. In 1836, the Commission of Antiquities retrieved it and began plans to have it restored.Ridderbos et al., (2005), 31 Four decades later it underwent major restoration – between 1875 and 1878 – when many of these additions were removed, but not without significant damage to the original paintwork, such as the loss of pigment to the wall-hangings in the donor panels, which were originally red and gold.Campell (1972), 291 In general, the central inside panels are better preserved than the interior and exterior wings.Campbell (2004), 77 De Salins' panel is damaged; its colours have darkened with age; originally the niche was a light blue (today it is light green) and the shield held by the angel was painted in blue. The panels were laterally divided so both sides could be displayed simultaneously, and a number have been transferred to canvas. Sources and influences Stefan Lochner, Last Judgement, 1435. Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne Since before 1000, complex depictions of the Last Judgement had been developing as a subject in art, and from the 11th century became common as wall-painting in churches, typically placed over the main door in the west wall, where it would be seen by worshippers as they left the building.Hall (1983), 138–143 Iconographical elements were gradually built up, with St Michael weighing the souls first seen in 12th-century Italy. Since this scene has no biblical basis, it is often thought to draw from pre-Christian parallels such as depictions of Anubis performing a similar role in Ancient Egyptian art.Hall (1983), 6–9 In medieval English, a wall-painting of the Last Judgement was called a doom.OED \\"Doom\\", 6 Van der Weyden may have drawn influence from Stefan Lochner's 1435 Last Judgement, and a similar 1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great Deësis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven, and the gates of Hell. In both of the earlier works, Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he is also above a globe. While the two earlier works are filled with dread and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the sorrowful, self-controlled dignity typical of his best work. This is most evident in the manner in which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.Lane (1989), 171 The work's moralising tone is apparent from some of its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath the weight of the damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying. Hans Memling, Last Judgement, late 1460s, National Museum, Gdańsk The similarities between the altarpiece and the late-1460s Last Judgement by van der Weyden's apprentice Hans Memling has led art historians to suggest a common tie with Florentine banker Angelo Tani who gave commissions to van der Weyden before his death in 1464. Because Memling's apprenticeship post-dated the completion and installation of the altarpiece, art historians speculate that Tani or Memling would have seen it in situ, or that Memling came into possession of a workshop copy.Lane (1991), 629 In Memling's work the Deësis and Christ's placement, above St Michael with his scales, are almost identical to the Beaune Altarpiece.Lane (1991), 627 Despite the marked similarities, the crowded scenes in Memling's Last Judgement contrast sharply with \\"the hushed serenity of Rogier's composition\\", according to Lane, and in a mirror image of van der Weyden's altarpiece, Memling shows the saved outweighing the damned in St Michael's scales.

Malate is oxidized to pyruvate and CO2, and NADP+ is reduced to NADPH. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate- decarboxylating). This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and carbon fixation. NADP-malic enzyme is one of three decarboxylation enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NAD-malic enzyme and PEP carboxykinase. Although often one of the three photosynthetic decarboxylases predominate, the simultaneous operation of all three is also shown to exist. ChemDraw generated NADP-ME chemical reaction detailing the chemical structures involved. Enzyme structure Crystal structure of a homologous human malic enzyme highlights key residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Site II contains the GLGDLG motif, site V contains the other GXGXXG motif, the highlighted arginine residue interacts with both NADP+ and malate, and the highlighted lysine may possibly be involved in base catalysis. PDB file identity for image is 2aw5. Based on crystallography data of homologous NADP-dependent malic enzymes of mammalian origin, a 3D model for C4 pathway NADP-ME in plants has been developed, identifying the key residues involved in substrate-binding or catalysis. Dinucleotide binding involves two glycine-rich GXGXXG motifs, a hydrophobic groove involving at least six amino acid residues, and a negatively charged residue at the end of the βB-strand. The primary sequence of the first motif, 240GLGDLG245, is a consensus marker for phosphate binding, evidencing involvement with NADP binding, while the other glycine rich motif adopts a classical Rossmann fold—also a typical marker for NADP cofactor binding. Mutagenesis experiments in maize NADP-ME have supported the current model. Valine substitution for glycine in either motif region rendered the enzyme completely inactive while spectral analysis indicated no major changes from wild-type form. The data is suggestive of direct impairment at a key residue involved in binding or catalysis rather than an inter-domain residue influencing conformational stability. Additionally, a key arginine residue at site 237 has been shown to interact both with malate and NADP+ substrates, forming key favorable electrostatic interactions to the negatively charged carboxylic-acid and phosphate group respectively. Elucidation of whether the residue plays a role in substrate binding or substrate positioning for catalysis has yet to be determined. Lysine residue 255 has been implicated as a catalytic base for the enzymes reactivity; however, further studies are still required to conclusively establish its biochemical role. =Structural studies= , 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and . Biological function In a broader context, malic enzymes are found within a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, from fungi to mammals, and beyond that, are shown to localize in range of subcellular locations, including the cytosol, mitochondria, and chloroplast. C4 NADP-ME, specifically, is in plants localized in bundle sheath chloroplasts. During C4 photosynthesis, an evolved pathway to increase localized CO2 concentrations under the threat of enhanced photorespiration, CO2 is captured within mesophyll cells, fixed as oxaloacetate, converted into malate and released internally within bundle sheath cells to directly feed RuBisCO activity. This release of fixed CO2, triggered by the favorable decarboxylation of malate into pyruvate, is mediated by NADP-dependent malic enzyme. In fact, the significance of NADP-ME activity in CO2 conservation is evidenced by a study performed with transgenic plants exhibiting a NADP-ME loss of function mutation. Plants with the mutation experienced 40% the activity of wild-type NADP-ME and achieved significantly reduced CO2 uptake even at high intercellular levels of CO2, evidencing the biological importance of NADP-ME at regulating carbon flux towards the Calvin cycle. Enzyme regulation NADP-ME expression has been shown to be regulated by abiotic stress factors. For CAM plants, drought conditions cause stoma to largely remain shut to avoid water loss by evapotranspiration, which unfortunately leads to CO2 starvation. In compensation, closed stoma activates the translation of NADP-ME to reinforce high efficiency of CO2 assimilation during the brief intervals of CO2 intake, allowing for carbon fixation to continue. In addition to regulation at the longer time scale by means of expression control, regulation at the short-time scale can occur through allosteric mechanisms. C4 NADP-ME has been shown to be partially inhibited by its substrate, malate, suggesting two independent binding sites: one at the active site and one at an allosteric site. However, the inhibitory effect exhibits pH-dependence – existent at a pH of 7 but not a pH of 8. The control of enzyme activity due to pH changes align with the hypothesis that NADP-ME is most active while photosynthesis is in progress: Active light reactions leads to a rise in basicity within the chloroplast stroma, the location of NADP-ME, leading to a diminished inhibitory effect of malate on NADP-ME and thereby promoting a more active state. Conversely, slowed light reactions leads to a rise in acidity within the stroma, promoting the inhibition of NADP-ME by malate. Because the high energy products of the light reactions, NADPH and ATP, are required for the Calvin cycle to proceed, a buildup of CO2 without them is not useful, explaining the need for the regulatory mechanism. This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation. Evolution NADP-malic enzyme, as all other C4 decarboxylases, did not evolve de novo for CO2 pooling to aid RuBisCO. Rather, NADP-ME was directly transformed from a C3 species in photosynthesis, and even earlier origins from an ancient cystolic ancestor. In the cytosol, the enzyme existed as a series of housekeeping isoforms purposed towards a variety of functions including malate level maintenance during hypoxia, microspore separation, and pathogen defense. In regards to the mechanism of evolution, the C4 functionality is thought to have stemmed from gene duplication error both within promoter regions, triggering overexpression in bundle-sheath cells, and within the coding region, generating neofunctionalization. Selection for CO2 preservation function as well as enhanced water and nitrogen utilization under stressed conditions was then shaped by natural pressures.

She was dubbed \\"Madame Loire\\" by the French press. She was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 1992 for her efforts on preserving the Loire River, the longest river in France, from dam constructions. Education Christine Jean was trained in agronomy at École nationale supérieure d'agronomie et des industries alimentaires and holds a master's degree in ecology in the domain of hydrology from Paul Verlaine University – Metz.  SOS Loire Vivante  Christine Jean coordinated a nationwide campaign to prevent the damming of the Loire. This was very important as the Loire is one of the last wild rivers with great ecological wealth. The dam project was supported by parts of the building industry who wanted to make a profit. Furthermore, it should have been used for using the water for cooling four reactors that were supposed to be built along the river. The activism started when Jean, with the help of the World Wildlife Fund, united several small initiatives along the Loire river to a nationwide organization called SOS Loire Vivante. Unified they could provide a strong opposition to the dam project. With funding of the WWF France, WWF Germany and WWF International they inaugurated a program to educate the public, engage media, sponsor conferences, stage demonstrations and ultimately file a legal suit against the dam- building consortium. After a long sustained opposition campaign they reached a victory when the French government announced that it would discard the Serre de la Fare dam construction and instead adopt an alternative river management program. The alternative program included tightening controls on urbanization in flood risk areas. Furthermore, two hydroelectric installations were demolished to make it more possible for migratory fish like salmon to reach their spawning grounds. Activism After her successful campaign against the dam project she continued her activism. She did for example fight against the enlargement of Nantes - St.- Nazaire port at the Loire rivers mouth that were supposed to accommodate a nuclear power plant.

The Revolt of the Brotherhoods (, ) was a revolt by artisan guilds (Germanies) against the government of King Charles V in the Kingdom of Valencia, part of the Crown of Aragon. It took place from 1519-1523, with most of the fighting occurring during 1521. The Valencian revolt inspired a related revolt in the island of Majorca, also part of Aragon, which lasted from 1521-1523\\\\. The revolt was an anti-monarchist, anti-feudal autonomist movement inspired by the Italian republics. It also bore a strong anti-Islamic aspect, as rebels rioted against Valencia's peasant Muslim population (also called mudéjars, to contrast with crypto-Muslims or Moriscos in the Crown of Castile, where Islam was outlawed) and imposed forced conversions to Christianity. The agermanats are comparable to the comuneros of neighboring Castile, who fought a similar revolt against Charles from 1520-1522\\\\. Both rebellions were partially inspired by the departure for Germany of Charles, the new King of both Castile and Aragon (in a personal union that would form the basis for the Kingdom of Spain), to take the throne as Holy Roman Emperor and leaving behind a somewhat disreputable Royal Council and regent. Origins =Economic troubles and pirate raids= Valencia was dealing with a variety of problems in the early 16th century. In King Ferdinand II's later years as ruler, the government slowly decayed and became more corrupt. The economy in Aragon was not as vibrant as in Andalusia, as it was more based on agriculture and less on the lucrative maritime trade. Valencia's economy was dominated by two somewhat static factions: the landed nobles, who controlled agriculture and the countryside, and the Germanies (guilds), which controlled light manufacturing, crafts, and the cities. Outbreaks of famine, flood, and plague impeded the economy still further. However, the most imminent threat to the country was that of warfare. Ferdinand pursued an ambitious foreign policy, participating in the Italian Wars and invading Navarre in 1512 during a war against France. This stretched the finances of Aragon and Castile to their limit. Spanish relations with Muslim nations and North Africa were still exceedingly poor after the Reconquista, and the coast of Aragon was constantly raided by Barbary pirates. Revolt of the oppressed Muslim-convert population in the recently conquered Granada was also a concern. Royal troops were required to be stationed in Granada and Navarre to maintain order. In order to maintain a coastal defense against the pirates without the cost of deploying the army, Ferdinand gave the Germanies permission to arm themselves and form their own paramilitary brigades. The local nobles did not approve of this and initially tried to prevent the Germanies from arming, fearful of the consequences of an armed citizenry. = Succession of Charles I = Ferdinand died in January 1516 and was succeeded by his mentally unstable daughter Joanna. Within a few weeks, her son proclaimed himself her co-ruler as King Charles I of Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in Netherlands and his affairs were mostly controlled by the Flemish noble William de Croÿ, sieur de Chièvres. In 1517, the seventeen-year-old King sailed to Castile, where he was formally recognised as King of Castile. There, his Flemish court provoked much scandal, as de Croÿ shamelessly sold government privileges for personal money and installed other Flemish nobles into government offices. In May 1518, Charles traveled to Barcelona in Aragon, where he would remain for nearly two years. Here, he haggled with Aragon's slightly stronger cortes, the Generalitat, for privileges and his formal recognition as King of Aragon. Aragon managed to maintain more local control than Castile did, but mostly because Aragon was poorer and there was no point in pressing the issue for extra tax money that wasn't there to be collected. In 1519, the King's paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, died. Charles competed with King Francis I of France to win the imperial election by aggressively bribing prince-electors. Charles won, becoming Emperor Charles V. He left Aragon to return to Castile to raise funds to pay down the debts he had incurred in the election. The taxes granted to Charles at a Castilian cortes in Corunna would help spark the Revolt of the Comuneros of Castile. Of more importance for Aragon, in the summer of 1519 Charles granted his permission to the Germanies to arm themselves against the raiding Muslim fleets. While permission had previously been granted under Ferdinand, Charles was able to force the Valencian nobles to accept this decision. First phase, 1519: The Council of Thirteen in Valencia In 1519, the plague struck Valencia. Several of the most important nobles died, and many of the others fled to the countryside. The superstitious population concluded that the disease was punishment for immorality, and rioted against people suspected of being homosexual as well as Muslims.A History of Spain and Portugal The government tried to contain the rioters, but the rioters deposed the government instead. The Germanies stepped into this power vacuum, and gradually replaced the royal government of the capital of Valencia. The \\"Council of Thirteen\\" (, ), comprising one representative from each union, became the new government of the capital city. Joan Llorenç emerged as the leader and intellectual statesmen of the Germanies, and he sought a representative government similar to the Italian republics such as the Republic of Genoa. Llorenç and the Council of Thirteen gave power to the Germanies, who re-established their monopolies on their professions and forbade anyone to work who did not affiliate with one of the guilds. King Charles I was in Aachen, Germany in 1520 where he was dealing with his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor. The only steps he took initially was to revoke his grant of arms to the Germanies and several other concessions, measures which were completely ignored. The tension increased with the nomination of the Castilian war veteran Diego Hurtado de Mendoza as viceroy in April 1520. At this point, the Germanies staged a coup d'état in which Mendoza was forced to flee and popular representatives replaced most of the remaining government functions and the courts. Councils of Thirteen took power in the other cities of Valencia as the revolt spread. With this, what had previously been a quiet assertion of power became a civil war. Second phase, 1520-1521: War The moderate Joan Llorenç died in 1520, and was replaced by Vicent Peris. The death of Llorenç robbed the moderate faction (including Caro, Sorolla, and Montfort), concerned with the good governance of Valencia, of its strongest voice; the radical faction took power (including Urgellés, Estellés, Peris, and Borrell) which sought land reform and a social revolution to reduce the power of the aristocracy. Peris took an extremely aggressive stand toward both the nobles and the Muslims. In the summer of 1520, some military actions occurred such as an assault on the viscounty of Xelva, the pillage of noble palaces, and the redistribution of nearby land. The Moorish quarters of the city of Valencia were attacked and burned after an accusation of collaboration with the nobility. However, the war did not truly expand until June 1521. The royalists were separated into two groups. In the south, the viceroy personally led a force based out of Denia. Andalusian nobles sent an army to assist as well, headed by Pedro Fajardo, 1st Marquis of los Vélez. In the north, Alonso de Aragon, the Duke of Segorbe, captained a force. The Germanies took over several cities at once: in the north, the regions of the Maestrat and Camp de Morvedre; and in the south, in Alzira, Xàtiva, Gandia, and Elx. In the north, the agermanats led by Jaime Ros suffered two defeats in short succession, first in the Battle of Orpesa and afterwards in the Battle of Almenara. The southern front saw more success, as the rebels commanded by Vicent Peris took the castle of Xàtiva and won an important victory in the Battle of Gandia against the personal troops of the viceroy on July 23, 1521. After the battle, the agermanats looted the town and farmland of the Gandia region, and undertook a campaign of forced baptisms upon all the Muslims of the Safor. After this quick succession of battles, the leadership of the Germanies fell into disarray. The Valencian bourgeoisie favored some form of negotiated exit, while the military leaders urged the Germanies to fight on. Distracted by internal disputes, the agermanats suffered a crushing defeat a mere week after their victory at Gandia in the Battle of Oriola. The Marquis of Los Vélez commanded the victorious royal army manned with reinforcements from Andalusia, and approximately 4,000 agermanats were killed.Bonilla, p. 203. Almost all of the south of the Kingdom of Valencia fell back into royalist hands. The Council of Thirteen resigned, and three months later, on November 1, the City of Valencia surrendered to the royalist army. Third phase, 1522: Countryside Marauders Vicent Peris, after holing up in the secure fort at Xàtiva for some months, came back to Valencia on the night of February 18, 1522. He hoped to revive the Germanies and respark the revolt. Meeting with his supporters, he was somehow seen or betrayed, and a desperate night battle in the streets broke out between the agermanats and royal soldiers. Eventually, Peris was cornered and smoked out by setting his house on fire. He was arrested, and on March 3, 1522, he was executed along with his closest supporters by drawing and quartering. Only Xàtiva and Alzira remained under the control of the Germanies. A mysterious new leader emerged for the Germanies, calling himself \\"The Hidden\\" (, , \\"The Hidden/Shrouded [One]\\"). The historical record is unclear, but The Hidden claimed to be a prince  sources differ on who his claimed parents were  hidden away in his childhood who had a mystical vision of the prophets Elijah and Enoch. He was told of his true heritage and that he must save Valencia. The Hidden emphasized a more religious and messianic revolt rather than the social revolution that Peris promoted. He attracted support and recruited from local country elites, leaders, and rich farmers. In this phase, the Germanies area of action limited itself to the Horta of Valencia, Alzira, and Xàtiva. Farms were looted, castles assaulted, and any Muslims in their domain were forced to convert. Realizing that the revolt had not yet been quashed, the royalist government placed a large bounty on the head of The Hidden. He was killed by assailants eager for money in Burjassot on May 19, 1522. Many others soon sprang up claiming to be The Hidden, but none proved charismatic enough to take over leadership of the Germanies. Viceroy Mendoza also advocated a policy of conciliation, offering generous terms to those who surrendered and agreed to return to royal governance. In December 1522, the strongholds of Xàtiva and Alzira fell, which ended the Revolt of the Germanies in Valencia conclusively. Germanies of Majorca, 1521-1523 Ibiza stayed loyal to the royal government, while almost all of Majorca ( on this map) was controlled by the agermanats. The revolt was known in other realms of Aragon, and inspired a new overthrow of the government in the Kingdom of Majorca after the unpopular imprisonment of seven guild members. As in Valencia, a Council of Thirteen was constituted to rule, led by Juan Crespí. The rebels gained control of the capital and dismissed the governor-general, Miguel de Gurrea, who fled to Ibiza. The nobles who survived the massacre that occurred in the Bellver Castle took refuge in Alcúdia, the only part of the island that remained faithful to the King during the year and a half the Germanies ruled Majorca. During this period, the Council of Thirteen ran an independent government, and did not coordinate with their brethren in Valencia. In August 1522, the emperor sent 800 men to help Gurrea. By the next year, they had taken the capital, and on March 8, 1523, the agermanats surrendered with the mediation of the bishop. Despite this mediation, more than 200 agermanats were executed, and many others fled. Aftermath =Forced conversion of the Muslims= The Muslims of the Kingdom of Valencia suffered for a variety of reasons. The warfare with Muslim corsairs kept tensions high between the religions, and encouraged a hostile mentality. Former Muslims (Moriscos) were still a problem in conquered Granada, causing those in Valencia to have little sympathy. Economic reasons existed as well. The nobles used the poorer Muslims as a cheap labor supply, which encouraged friction between them and lowly paid or unemployed Christians jealous of their jobs and annoyed at their effect on wages. The noble manors competed with the guilds for economic dominance, and thus the Muslims were seen as part of the opposing system. Lastly, some utopian agermanats believed in a universal brotherhood of all Christian peoples, and that conversion of all the Muslims would assuredly save both their souls and their children's souls. The forced conversion of the Muslims reached its height in the summer of 1521, after the victory at Gandia. Once the revolt had been defeated, the noblemen questioned the validity of these obligatory baptisms. In order to make a decision, Emperor Charles summoned a board of theologians and jurists in Madrid. In 1525 this board spoke in favor of sustaining the Christian faith of the new converts, since they had not been forced into the baptism. The baptism was freely chosen as an alternative to death; only if the baptism had been imposed with no choice at all would it have been invalid. This decision provoked two uprisings from the recently converted population, one in Benaguasil in November 1525 and another in Sierra de Espadán in Castellón in March 1526. This decision ended the Muslim exception of the mudéjars in the country, but began the problem of Moriscos in Valencia whose Christian faith was, understandably, insincere. =Repression of the Germanies= With the fall of Valencia and the entry of the viceroy into the city in late 1521, a moderate repression started. Viceroy Diego Hurtado de Mendoza did not wish to start a new revolt, but took action against the most important of the leaders, and issued a general pardon to minor agermanats who had merely served in the army. However, Mendoza was replaced as viceroy by Germaine of Foix, Ferdinand's second wife, who returned to the country with Charles and a new German husband (who was jointly named a viceroy with her). She favored a harsher policy toward the rebels, and approximately 800 death sentences to former rebels would be dispensed. Sources differ on how much she personally ordered, but it seems likely at least 100 death warrants were directly approved of by her. Heavy fines were imposed on the guilds as punishment, as well as a total of more than 360,000 ducats of fines to all cities that had sided with the Germanies, and 2,000,000 ducats of fines were levied in compensations for damages sustained by properties during the war. The period of heavier repression ended on December 23, 1524, when Germaine signed a pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia and by extension the other Germanies. King Charles signed an additional general pardon in 1528, suggesting that scattered reprisals might have continued afterward. Germaine was in favor of the integration of Spain, and Valencian nationalists point to her pardon as one of the first official documents in Aragon written in Castilian Spanish. Later influence The Revolt's failure is often seen as a political catalyst for Valencia's shift to a modern, centralized, and authoritarian state away from a feudal one. The local nobility were weakened, and needed to call upon royal power to defeat the rebels. The conversion of the Muslims shrank the pool of cheap labor that the noblemen had relied upon. And though the timing may be a coincidence, Germaine's appearance in Valencia helped weaken the old nobility and reinforce royal power in Valencia. A later uprising in 1693 was partially inspired by the Revolt of the Germanies and took their name from it. The rebels called themselves the Segona Germania (Second Brotherhood) and demanded exemption from high feudal rents and duties. This revolt was quickly suppressed by the Spanish government with only a small amount of bloodshed. Despite taking on the name, the revolt was quite different in origin; the Second Brotherhood was mostly made up of peasants rather than the middle-class guildsmen of the 1519-1523 revolt, and lacked the anti-Muslim aspect of the original rebellion.

Reproduction is understood as the maintenance and continuation of existing social relations. Originally proposed by Karl Marx in Das Kapital, this concept is a variety of Marx's notion of economic reproduction. According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, there are four types of capital that contribute to social reproduction in society: economic capital, cultural capital, human capital, and social capital. Social reproduction in this sense is distinct from the term as it is used in Marxist feminism to discuss reproductive labor. In that application, it is used to explain the role of women in wider social and class structures, and their (often unrecognized) contribution to the capitalist economy via their (traditional) role within the household as both child-bearers and family caretakers, and by extension women's role as providers of free labor that is necessary to produce and maintain current and future workers. Four types of capital All four of Pierre Bourdieu's forms of capital play a role in social reproduction, as capital is passed from generation to generation and keeps people in the same social class as their parents before them. This keeps reproducing inequality through the system of social stratification.Doob, Christopher B. 2003. Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education. The four types of capital are: # Economic capital: the income and wealth of a person, which may well come along with one's inheritance of cultural capital. # Cultural capital: the shared outlook, beliefs, knowledge, and skills that are passed between generations, which may in turn influence human capital. # Human capital: the education and job training a person receives, and which contributes to the likelihood that one will acquire social capital. # Social capital: the social network to which one belongs, which can largely influence one's ability to find opportunities, especially employment.  In education  Social reproduction, when co-opted with cultural reproduction, allows for sociology of education to assume its role.Education is an attempt at leveling the playing field by allowing those in poorer classes a chance to move up. However, it fails in many critical ways; for example, education is costly: better schools mean better equipment, better books, and better teachers, all of which remain beyond the pay grade of the poverty line. Thus, higher education becomes exclusive to higher classes, leaving people of lower classes with much less to work with, as well as fewer opportunities. The education system in many high-income countries polarizes individuals from a young age. It creates elites who care little for those in the classes beneath them and believe that they should earn extraordinarily more than everyone else, all the while defining people by their jobs, concluding that those with low-paid jobs for that reason live in relative poverty. The system strives to maintain the status quo so children can be greatly denigrated. As the rich take in an increasing amount of the country's wealth, there is less and less for the general populace, resulting in poorer education. = Education in the United States = Statistics show that the majority of dropouts are below the poverty line. Due to a lack of capital, they do not complete their education, seeing it as less convenient to complete schooling rather than find work, and support themselves or their families. Usually, these dropouts consist of the minority groups, such as Hispanics and African Americans. Many drop out due to lack of funds to continue their education, some are single parents, or have had a deceased parent, which makes it difficult to study and work at the same time. These issues are rarely seen in higher classes, making it less likely for them to drop out and reject opportunities.  In health and illness  The sociology of health and illness studies how social life affects morbidity and mortality rate, and vice versa. Social reproduction is involved in this field when it comes to how inequalities affect the health of people in particular classes. The greater the economic inequality, the more of a toll it takes on the health of the populace, from life expectancy to infant mortality, and in cases like the U.S, increasing rates of obesity. Studies conducted on the population of high income countries make this apparent. It is not just simply poverty, though they do go hand in hand, but it also leads to a gap in social cohesion, which leads the general populace to be more stressed, fearful, and insecure. In the majority of high-income countries, the top 1% live, on average, 10 years longer than the average 99%, statistically making those born into the poorer classes naturally have a shorter life span. This can be attributed to the top 1% having access to better healthcare. The bottom 99% may be disinclined to visit doctors and take cough medicine for more serious illnesses, and are disadvantaged especially in cases of incurable illnesses like AIDS where constant medicating with expensive, non-subsidized drugs is the only way to sustain a normal life. Those born into a lower class are at a higher risk of suffering from illness. In the past, the poor suffered from hunger and starvation. However, in high-income countries like the U.S, the opposite is true. Food-insecure families are the most prone to high rates of obesity, especially in children. This can be attributed to the generally higher cost of healthful foods, and a lack of education regarding healthy eating habits, causing fast foods, or other unhealthy alternatives to be consumed often for their ease of acquisition and generally low price.This leads to long-term epidemiological problems in which children who become obese maintain their obesity into their adult lives, suffering from associated ailments such as heart disease, high blood pressure, increased risk for several types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, infertility, arthritis, breathing difficulties and/or depression.  Social class system in the United States  Social reproduction is the passing on of social inequality across generations. The upper class has many advantages; having money provides the ability to have even more resources to get ahead. The opposite is true for lower classes, where with less money, there are fewer resources. As Marx states, \\"[c]lass-struggle between capital and labor is forced into the background.\\" \\"Capitalism isn't working. Another world is possible\\" is an argument that is made by many protesters around the world, who gather in rallies more and more often every year. These protests are more prevalent in higher-income countries where most of the 1% live like the U.S and the U.K. with a growing social cohesion among protesters because the vast majority of people in rich countries are suffering due to increasing inequalities. Many of the poor have begun to depend on the state rather than their own wages. All the while, their descendants will be raised in a fixed system that favors the elites, so they are bound to the same class they were born in. Social reproduction revolves around the understanding that rich breed rich, and the poor breed poor: those born into a particular class are more often than not bound to live their lives in that class. The following statistics are of the U.S. population. = Lower class = The lower class is a class afflicted by a cycle of poverty, homelessness, and unemployment. This is seen as they suffer from the inability to pay bills some of which then find themselves living on the street, experiencing food insecurity as many families will find themselves going hungry least once a year, or lack of medical care where many cannot pay for medication or treatment for potentially fatal illnesses. All the while, this class is usually labelled by the media as being lazy, system abusers, or criminals. Those born into this class have lower class mobility due to restrictions on resources, such as money and access to better education. This class is a point of reference in social reproduction, comprising 15% to 20% of the U.S. population. The majority of those in the lower classes are minorities. = Working class = The working class has a minimal education. They are usually physical laborers with little to no qualifications. They can also be seen working service industries, but are underpaid and no chance for promotions in their standings. Potential skilled workers who may at times work better-paying but dangerous jobs. Those born into this system usually have a torch of labor passed on to them, and they follow the same profession their family did. They comprise 30% to 40% of the U.S. population, and the majority are minorities. = Middle class = The middle class consists of two divided classes. The lower half bears resemblance to those of lower classes, i.e., usually less educated with lower incomes, but they can be found in managerial positions, in education, as well as small business owners. The upper half consists of professionals and educated business owners. Those born into this class have the most diversity, either deciding to take up the torch or surpass their parents. The majority goes on to complete their educations, and maintain a career. They comprise 40% to 50% of the U.S. population. The majority is a blend. = Upper class = The upper class is known to hold 25% of the wealth in the U.S.. This class shares something in common with the middle class. A division into two. The lower half who consist of new money, investments, and successful business owners. The majority who were originally Middle Class or rarely lower. The upper half consists of families who have been rich for generations. A point of reference in social reproduction brought along the ages. Those born into this class receive inheritances from those who die and so forth. Their descendants are sent off to the finest of schools leaving them with the most opportunities of all. They comprise 1% to 3% of the U.S. population. The lower half can be a blend, whereas the upper half consists of mostly white families.

Biography Born in New York City, the daughter of David and Rea (Welt) Hammer,The Monthly Supplement (International Who's Who, Inc., 1955), p. 1583. she received a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1941 and worked for a few years on the research staff of the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan. She earned a doctorate in public law and government from Columbia University, where she specialized in international relations. She became known in the early 1950s for her work on colonial rule in French Indochina. She was regarded as one of the first Americans to become scholars of Vietnamese history, often traveling to the Asian country for extended periods. Her first book, The Struggle for Indochina, published in 1954, was regarded as a pioneering text for that period of history. Douglas Pike, a historian and director of research at the Vietnam Center at Texas Tech University, said that as a scholar Hammer was \\"one of the few Americans that got into Vietnam before the American buildup there\\" in the mid-1960s. It follows the history of French Indochina from 1940 to 1955, documenting the Japanese takeover of the French colony during the Second World War and the subsequent struggle between the communist Vietminh and the French Union between 1946 and 1954, which resulted in the independence and partition of Vietnam at the 17th parallel as a result of the Geneva Conference. A Death in November: America in Vietnam, 1963 was published in 1987, and Thomas Omestad wrote in a New York Times Book Review, \\"The title of this carefully researched book refers to the death of Ngo Dinh Diem, president of South Vietnam from 1955 to 1963, and that of his brother and adviser, Ngo Dinh Nhu.\\" The book incorporated a variety of classified American government cables detailing the American involvement in the downfall of Diem. It documents the events leading up to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup in November, which saw the Arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm, the first President of South Vietnam, and follows the downfall of the Diem regime amid mass protests following the Hue Vesak shootings, in which nine Buddhists were shot dead by government forces while protesting a ban on the Buddhist flag. The book documents the unfolding Buddhist crisis, covering events such as the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc, the Xa Loi Pagoda raids and the United States' maneuvering amid the crisis. Hammer was regarded by Pike as being \\"very loyal personally to Diem\\" and being \\"bitter\\" about his demise. After the fall of Diem, she moved to France and vowed to stay away from the subject. Despite this, she still wrote A Death in November. She died of lymphoma in 2001 in New York City.

Kennedy. He was seen as a pivotal figure in the changing of U.S. foreign policy, including recommending support for the coup d'état that deposed the first president of South Vietnam, Ngô Đình Diệm. Following the arrest and assassination of Diệm, which was backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, General Dương Văn Minh assumed the presidency in November, 1963. The negative repercussions from the coup and the John F. Kennedy assassination, which occurred later in the month, led to Forrestal's retirement from government service in 1965. Speculation at the time suggested that he left the White House because of his decreasing influence in the administration of Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson. Other than his political life, Forrestal was a senior partner in Shearman & Sterling and a legal advisor to the state-owned Algerian oil company, Sonatrach during the 1970s. Forrestal also had a role in the German-based Allied Control Council and the U.S.–USSR Trade and Economic Council. Biography Forrestal was born in New York City on November 26, 1927 to James Forrestal and Josephine Forrestal. His father served as Secretary of the Navy before becoming the first Secretary of Defense in 1947. In 1946 Michael Forrestal graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy. He received a commission in the United States Navy, and was appointed an assistant naval attaché in Moscow under W. Averell Harriman, the Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He later served as secretary of the Quadripartite Naval Directorate, part of the post-World War II Allied Control Council that administered Berlin. From 1948 to 1950 he was deputy director of the East-West Trade Division of the U.S. European Cooperation Administration. Forrestal attended Princeton University, and completed his LL.B. degree at Harvard Law School in 1953. He practiced with the New York City firm of Shearman & Sterling, and became a partner in 1960. By 1978 he had become the firm's senior partner.  Vietnam War  From 1962 to 1965 Forrestal was a member of the senior staff of the National Security Council, where he specialized in Asian affairs and participated in the deliberations and decisions that led to increased U.S. military presence in Vietnam. In response to President Ngo Dinh Diem's repression of the Buddhist majority, widespread civil disobedience broke out, culminating in nationwide raids on Buddhist temples leaving an estimated death toll in the hundreds. Forrestal, Harriman and Hilsman were prominent among the State Department officials who felt that Diem needed to be removed, and began drafting a response to the raids to send to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.. They were the only senior State Department officials on duty on August 24, 1963, a Saturday afternoon, with Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and CIA director John McCone on vacation. President Kennedy was on vacation, when Forrestal telephoned seeking to expedite the process with the commander-in-chief's verbal approval.Jones, p. 315. Kennedy asked them to \\"wait until Monday\\" when all the key figures would be in Washington, but Forrestal said that Harriman and Hilsman wanted to get the cable \\"out right away\\". Kennedy thus told Forrestal to get another high-ranking official to \\"get it cleared\\". The trio then contacted other senior officials, several of whom approved under the misunderstanding that someone else had already cleared the cable. Forrestal phoned Roswell Gilpatric in the evening and told him that both Kennedy and Rusk had already approved. Gilpatric later recalled that \\"If Rusk went along with it and the President went along with it, I wasn't going to oppose it.\\" Richard Helms of the CIA also endorsed the message without notifying his director McCone; he later said that he believed that Forrestal was only advising of a resolution that had already been made. Forrestal then told Kennedy that he had gained the support of Kennedy's inner circle, so the president told him to send the message. Cable 243 was thus sent to Lodge at 21:36.Jones, p. 316. Cable 243 called for Lodge to lobby for the removal from influence of Diem's younger brother and chief political adviser Ngo Dinh Nhu, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diem refused. As it was known that Diem would never sideline Nhu, it was effectively an authorisation for Lodge to encourage a military coup.Jacobs, pp. 162–63.Karnow, pp. 303–04.Halberstam, pp. 157–58. The decision to authorise the cable prompted significant infighting in the administration at the Monday morning meeting on August 26. Kennedy was met with angry comments by Rusk, McNamara, McCone and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Maxwell Taylor, all of whom denied authorizing the cable. Taylor condemned the cable as an \\"egregious end run\\" by an anti-Diem faction. He later claimed that the message was reflective of Forrestal and Hilsman's \\"well-known compulsion\\" to remove Diem.Jones, p. 318. and accused them of pulling \\"a fast one\\". Kennedy was unhappy at Forrestal for perceived incompetence and angrily criticised Forrestal for proceeding without gaining the explicit approval of McCone, Forrestal offered to resign. Kennedy acerbically replied \\"You're not worth firing. You owe me something, so you stick around.\\"Jones, p. 319. Forrestal was a longtime trustee of Phillips Exeter Academy and served as the board's president. In addition, he was a longtime patron of the Metropolitan Opera, and was a member of the Metropolitan Opera Association's executive committee. Personal life Forrestal died in New York City on January 11, 1989. He suffered an aneurysm while chairing a meeting of the Lincoln Center board of trustees. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, near the graves of his parents and his brother Peter. Michael Forrestal never married or had children. Notes References   External links  Michael V.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-phospho-D-gluconate:NADP+ 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include phosphogluconic acid dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconic carboxylase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), and 6-phospho-D-gluconate dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway. It employs one cofactor, manganese. Enzyme Structure The general structure, as well as several critical residues, on 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase appear to be well conserved over various species. The enzyme is a dimer, with each subunit containing three domains. The N-terminal coenzyme binding domain contains a Rossmann fold with additional α/β units. The second domain consists of a number of alpha helical structures, and the C-terminal domain consists of a short tail. The tails of the two subunits interact with each other to form a mobile lid on the enzyme's active site. As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and . Enzyme Mechanism The conversion of 6-phosphogluconate and NADP to ribulose 5-phosphate, carbon dioxide, and NADPH is believed to follow a sequential mechanism with ordered product release. 6-phosphogluconate is first oxidized to 3-keto-6-phosphogluconate and NADPH is formed and released. Then, the intermediate is decarboxylated, yielding a 1,2-enediol of ribulose 5-phosphate, which tautomerizes to form ribulose 5-phosphate. High levels of NADPH are believed to inhibit the enzyme, while 6-phosphogluconate acts to activate the enzyme. Biological Function 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is involved in the production of ribulose 5-phosphate, which is used in nucleotide synthesis, and functions in the pentose phosphate pathway as the main generator of cellular NADPH. Disease Relevance Since NADPH is required by both thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase to reduce oxidized thioredoxin and glutathionine, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is believed to be involved in protecting cells from oxidative damage. Several studies have linked oxidative stress to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as cancer, These studies have found phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity to be up-regulated, both in tumor cells and in relevant cortical regions of Alzheimer's patient brains, most likely as a compensatory reaction to highly oxidative environments. Recently, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase has been posited as a potential drug target for African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). The pentose phosphate pathway protects the trypanosomes from oxidative stress via the generation of NADPH and provides carbohydrate intermediates used in nucleotide synthesis. Structural differences between mammalian and trypanosome 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase have allowed for the development of selective inhibitors of the enzyme. Phosphorylated carbohydrate substrate and transition state analogues, non-carbohydrate substrate analogues and triphenylmethane-based compounds are currently being explored.

The book was first published in 1977. Plot summary Professor Bullfinch develops a glue which is stronger than any known glue. He christens it Irenium in honor of Danny's friend and neighbor Irene. The Blaze Chemical Company, which built a factory after draining a swamp, has leaked a chemical into the water which may cause the local dam to break. Danny, Joe and Irene use a can of Irenium to patch up the dam. In a subplot, Danny also uses the glue as a form of protest against Mr. Blaze by placing it on the backseat of his vehicle, causing Mr. Blaze to be stuck to the seat and having to cut his trousers apart, resulting in a humorous event where an angered Mr. Blaze appears at a town meeting to voice concerns over his chemical company wearing a blanket over his legs, giving the appearance of a kilt. Danny's mother, Mrs. Dunn, who originally protested the draining of the swamp, gives Danny a stern rebuke that the prank was immature and counterproductive, and that Danny is now required to make restitution, meaning he is now in debt to Mr. Blaze to pay for a new pair of men's trousers. Danny humbly sends a letter to Mr. Blaze with all the cash he has on hand, apologizing for what he did with the promise to work out a payment plan. During Danny's birthday party, a surprise guest is Mr. Blaze, who commends Danny for saving the town's dam and that his company will now have tougher oversight on chemical waste.

This doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase \\"leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant\\". Implied repeal is to be contrasted with the express repeal of legislation by the legislative body. Under United States law, \\"implied repeal\\" is a disfavored doctrine. That is, if a court can reconcile the two statutes with any reasonable interpretation, that interpretation is preferred to one that treats the earlier statute as invalidated by the later one.  In Canada  In Canadian law, it is possible for a law to be protected from implied repeal by way of a \\"primacy clause\\" which states that the act in question supersedes all other statutes until it is specifically repealed. Acts with such primacy clauses are called quasi-constitutional.  In the United Kingdom  In the 2002 English case Thoburn v Sunderland City Council (the so- called \\"Metric Martyrs\\" case), Lord Justice Laws held that some constitutionally significant statutes hold a higher status in UK law and are not subject to the doctrine of implied repeal. The case specifically dealt with s.2(2) of the European Communities Act, but in his judgment Lord Justice Laws also held the view that the Parliament Acts and the Human Rights Act are \\"constitutional statutes\\" and in his opinion may not be subject to the doctrine of implied repeal. A decade later in 2012, in a case before the United Kingdom Supreme Court, BH v The Lord Advocate (Scotland),[2012 UKSC 24] Lord Hope held (in Paragraph 30 of the judgment) that \\"the Scotland Act can only be expressly repealed; it cannot be impliedly repealed; that is because of its 'fundamental constitutional nature'.\\"Adam Perry and Farrah Ahmed: Are Constitutional Statutes 'Quasi-Entrenched'?

He was formerly an Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami. Biography =Early life and ordination= Estévez was born in Pedro Betancourt, Matanzas, Cuba. He fled to the United States as a young man under Operation Peter Pan. He is the second of three children (two boys and a girl) of Adriano and Estrella Estevez. He studied at Montreal University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and received a Licentiate in Theology in 1970. He was ordained a priest on May 30, 1970. In 1977, he received a Master in Arts from Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida, and in 1980, a Doctorate in Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy. He is fluent in Spanish, English, French and Italian. =Ministry= Estévez was sent to Honduras first as a priest than as a faculty member to two seminaries (1970–1975). He later joined the faculty at St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary in Boynton Beach, Florida (1975–77) and from 1980–1986 he was the President/Rector of St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary. He then became the campus minister at Florida International University, Miami, Florida (1987–2001), and then the pastor of St. Agatha Church located next to the Florida International University (1987–2001). He then returned to St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary as the Dean of Spiritual Formation (2001–03). =Auxiliary Bishop of Miami= He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Miami and Titular Bishop of Kearney on November 21, 2003. On January 7, 2004, he was consecrated as bishop at the Cathedral of St. Mary by Archbishop John Clement Favalora of the Archdiocese of Miami and his co-consecrators were Archbishop Pedro Claro Meurice Estiu of the Archdiocese of Santiago de Cuba and Bishop Thomas James Olmsted of the Diocese of Phoenix. =Bishop of St. Augustine= Pope Benedict XVI appointed Estévez to succeed the retiring Bishop Victor Benito Galeone, in 2011. The appointment was announced in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, April 27, 2011, by Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. He was installed as Bishop of St. Augustine at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Mandarin (Jacksonville) Florida. The installation was attended by over 2,000 Catholics including lay people, deacons, priests, and Bishops from around the country and was broadcast on the Catholic news network EWTN. Bishop Estèvez hopes to connect especially with the Hispanics in his diocese, who make up about 7 percent of the population there. Estevez indicated that his main priority will be evangelization, focusing on reaching out to youth and \\"estranged\\" Catholics. Estevez wants to encourage the clergy to inject more joy and energy into church services so as to make parishes more welcoming to those who want to return to the church. He also wants to educate Catholics about how to embrace and express their faith to the fullest. The bishop is an active opponent of the death penalty and legal abortion, routinely meeting with legislators, writing policy papers and delivering speeches; he has also been an advocate for the rights of the disabled and immigrants. Bishop Estevez is very ecumenical in relations with other Christian ecclesial communities, working to foster Christian unity in northeast Florida. He initiated the first-ever ecumenical Vespers at the bishop-level in Florida on January 22, 2014, at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine. Among the Christian leaders attending were bishops of the AME, Episcopal, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Greek Orthodox, and representatives of the Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, and the executive director of the Florida Council of Churches. Attending were also clergy and lay leaders from various Christian churches from Northeast Florida. (For names and photos of participating Christian leaders, see: http://ecumenicalvespers.info.) He was present at the installation of ELCA Bishop Robert Schaefer near Tampa, FL. He collaborated with local Orthodox leaders in support of the meeting between Pope Francis and the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in Jerusalem on May 25, 2014.

It sits between Loudwater Cove and Arthur Harbour. The island is a roughly triangular rocky plot of granite land approximately long and wide at its widest point. Narrow Norsel Point, formerly considered a headland of Arthur Harbour, marks its westernmost extremity.  Geography  Three prominent rocks called the Elephant Rocks sit just to the south of Amsler Island, between the coast and Torgersen Island. The rocks are connected to one another by sandy shoals. Their name became established locally among United States Antarctic Program (USAP) personnel at nearby Palmer Station in about 1971, as the rocks provide habitat favoured by elephant seals.  History  Amsler Island was once thought to be a part of Anvers Island because the gap between the islands was covered by the Marr Ice Piedmont. The southern coast of Anvers Island, including the land now known as Amsler Island, was originally surveyed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1955. Norsel Point, thought to be a point on the coast of Arthur Harbour, was named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-names Committee (UK-APC) after the Norwegian sealing vessel , which sailed with the FIDS survey. Rapid recession of the ice due to global warming revealed Amsler Island as a separate island in 2004. The United States Board on Geographic Names named Amsler Island in recognition of American marine biologists Charles and Margaret Amsler of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who had researched the area for over three decades. The name Norsel Point was retained. Amsler Island was the original site of the United States Antarctic Program research base Palmer Station from 1965 until the current station approximately away was constructed in 1968.

The enzyme is mainly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is part of short-chain dehydrogenase (SDR) / reductase superfamily. The integral membrane enzyme is anchored to the membranes by its two hydrophobic chains. The catalytic domain of 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase is restricted to the lumenal compartment, suggesting its origin from compartmentalized process. 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase is also mainly associated to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of RPE cells. The 32-kDa integral membrane protein protein (p32) was found to act as the stereospecific 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD+ cofactor, and p32 catalyzes the biosynthesis of 11-cis retinal commonly found visual chromophore. One of the widely studied genes of retinol dehydrogenase RDH12, which encodes retinol dehydrogenase is part of the superfamily of short- chained alcohol dehydrogenases and reductases. RDH12 is mainly expressed in neuroretina and is composed of 7 exons encoding a 360-amino acid peptide. Zinc molecules serve as the ligand cofactor with the cofactor NAD. The retinol will interact with the enzyme at the area between those two cofactors. However, not all retinol dehydrogenases in visual cycle are identified, and this remains challenging to scientists due to the overlapping expressions and activity redundancy among two large RDH and RDH-like producing classes: microsomal short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase and cytosolic medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases. In Bovine, retinol dehydrogenase is found as a part of retinal rod outer segments and shows difficulty when separating from membrane. Its Stokes radius is 8.5 nm in Lubrol 12A9 mixed micelle.  Function  Retinoid dehydrogenases/reductases (oxidoreductases), including retinol dehydrogenase, catalyze the key oxidation-reduction reactions in the visual cycle, converting vitamin A to 11-cis retinal, which is the chromophore of the rod and cone photoreceptors. It is believed that RDHs at rod and cone are different, but related and can catalyze the same reaction. RDH12 is the primary enzyme that reduces all-trans retinal released from bleached photopigments during recovery phase in the visual cycle. The RDH12 enzyme can use either cis or trans retinoid isomers as substrates and can also function as both dehydrogenase (i.e. retinol to retinal) and reductase (i.e. retinal to retinol). The conversion of retinol to retinal is the rate-limiting step in the retinoic acid biosynthesis. In vertebrates, the retinoic acid is the ligand that controls nuclear receptor signaling pathway, which is responsible for growth and development as well as epithelial maintenance, therefore can be used for cancer and acne treatment. In human, ADH4 can exhibit at least 10 folds higher Vmax/Km than other ADH. Image 3: The visual phototransduction cycle yields 11-cis-retinal from 11-cis-retinol using 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase. Some retinol dehydrogenases are in extra-ocular tissues, such as human retinol dehydrogenase-4 (RoDH-4), which converts retinol and 1-cis-retinol to different aldehydes in liver and skin. It was also found that 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin), 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid, and 3,4-didehydroretinol can act as competitive inhibitor of the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase oxidative activity of the enzyme. This can potentially explain how isotretinoin, the active ingredient is Roaccutane (Accutane), can suppress sebaceous glands and be used for severe acne treatment.  Disease relevance  The missense mutation in gene rdh5, which codes for microsomal 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH5), causes fundus albipunctatus, whose symptoms include retinal white-spot accumulation, stationary night blindness caused by delay in cone and rod photopigment regeneration, and elderly cone dystrophy. At least 20 mutations in rdh12 gene, which encodes retinol dehydrogenase, can be associated to diseases, including severe and early-onset autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy (arRD), or Leber congenital amaurosis. Patients suffer from cone and rod malfunction since childhood and develop legal blindness when reaching adulthood. This suggests that RDH12 might play a central role in the visual cycle and can be a promising therapeutic target. A possible mechanism of the accelerated degradation among RDH12 mutants is the polyubiquitination by cytosolic ubiquitin ligases and subsequent degradation by proteosome. Its conformation aberration provokes the aforementioned accelerated degradation.

Corduff's parents first arrived in Rossport in 1947, and reclaimed a farm by hand out of bogland. He became a campaigner against Royal Dutch Shell's activities in his local area when the Corrib gas controversy began. He is married to Mary and they have six children and four grandchildren. Beginning of activism His farming existence changed with the discovery of gas eighty-three kilometres offshore, to the west of Broadhaven Bay. In 2000 the Corduffs discovered the exploitation of the gas involved the construction of a high pressure pipeline, 70 metres from their house, to a new refinery to be built in Bellanboy townland, just across the bay from his farm. They were also concerned about the proposed refinery site, its suitability and its proximity to the primary source of water for the region. Their concerns were echoed by neighbours who demanded more information. Rossport Five In 2004 Frank Fahey, then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources signed a Compulsory Acquisition Order to force the raw gas pipeline through his land. Landowner Willie Corduff said that \\"allowing Shell to construct a pipeline would be the same as having a time- bomb in the vicinity\\". Corduff refused Shell access to his land and was subsequently jailed for 94 days in 2005 as one of the Rossport Five for defying a court order not to interfere with Shell's work. In 2006 he said he was \\"prepared to die\\" rather than see the pipeline cross his land. Shell to Sea He is one of the founding members of the Shell to Sea campaign group which worked with no name since 2001 to oppose the Shell/Corrib Gas project until it adopted the name Shell to Sea in January 2005, five months prior to the jailing of five men in June of that year. Its aim is to have the gas processed at sea, get a fair and just return on Ireland's natural resources and to highlight human rights abuses alleged against Shell and the Irish state.. He has actively campaigned with them and has been arrested on numerous occasions. Pobal Chill Chomáin He is also a founding member of Pobal Chill Chomáin, a parochial pressure group of residents in the parish of Kilcommon who split from Shell to Sea to focus solely on health and safety issues of the Shell/Corrib gas project. In June 2009 PCC members Vincent McGrath with Willie and Mary Corduff had a meeting with the Norwegian Ambassador to discuss local concerns about the project. Goldman Environmental Prize He was awarded the European winner of the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2007 for his part in the protest campaign, which led to a halt of the construction of a pipeline through their land by Shell. He is the first Irish recipient ever of this award which is known as the \\"Nobel green prize\\" and is awarded to six people from the six continental regions every year who have taken great personal risk in the name of environmental protection. \\"This year's Prize recipients have succeeded in combating some of the most important environmental challenges we face today,\\" said Goldman Prize founder Richard N. Goldman. \\"Their commitment in the face of great personal risk inspires us all to think more critically about what ordinary people can do to make a difference.\\" 2009 alleged assault In April 2009, Shell resumed laying the offshore section of the pipeline after its environmental management plan was approved by Minister for Energy Eamon Ryan. Mr Corduff and two others climbed under a lorry at midday on Wednesday 22 April in a bid to stop work at a Glengad compound. He remained there until 4am on 23 April when he took a break. Following this, he was allegedly assaulted by several balaclaved men, including being hit on the head with a baton or torch, by security men working at the site.Village magazine, July/August 2009 The Registrar of Mayo General Hospital confirmed Corduff's injuries were consistent with his account of the assault, and photos obtained by Village Magazine, taken while he was in hospital and in the days after his release, show bruising on his head, face and body.'Irish media failing over Rossport', Village magazine, June 2009 Jim Farrell, a director of I-RMS, stated that he and his employees had intended to remove Corduff, but found him standing up, and had him taken away by ambulance when he complained of chest pains. Nobel peace prize winner, and patron of Afri, Archbishop Desmond Tutu condemned the alleged assault and called for a national and international investigation into it. On 27 April 2010, an independent report for the Frontline human rights organisation based in Dublin recommended that gardaí from outside Mayo carry out a new investigation into the alleged assault on Rossport farmer Willie Corduff. The analysis by barrister Brian Barrington, who has extensive experience relating to policing and human rights in Northern Ireland, of a number of incidents relating to the Corrib gas dispute was critical of Shell, the Garda, I-RMS security employed by Shell, the Department of Energy and a minority of protesters. In his analysis of the alleged assault on Mr Corduff, Mr Barrington obtained hospital records which stated that Mr Corduff had \\"been kicked all over the body\\" and experienced loss of consciousness, headaches, nausea and vomiting. Mr Barrington sought the opinion of Dr John Good, who has worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross assessing asylum seekers who have made claims of assault or torture, on the medical reports. Dr. Good found that Mr Corduff's injuries were \\"totally consistent with a history of assault\\". Featured in the media Willie has featured in several recent documentaries; 'Pipe Down': Winner of the Best Feature Documentary, Waterford Film Festival and 'The Pipe' – Winner Best Feature Documentary Galway Film Festival (July) 2010. In October 2009 he and his wife were featured in an episode of Would you believe on RTÉ television in Ireland. The documentary was entitled Living on the Edge. As it is part of a religious Affairs series Willie revealed he stopped attending church when the Bishop and the local priest blessed the gas rig and became advocates for the gas project. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission He has made a complaint, regarding an alleged assault by a Garda in April 2009, to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).RTÉ Would You Believe interview Willie's wife Mary, who received treatment for injuries, was one of 14 people who were told in October 2007 their complaints were deemed admissible, to the GSOC, in relation to their treatment and alleged assault by Gardaí at a protest at Pollathomas pier in June 2007. The GSOC has recommended that disciplinary action be taken against a senior member of An Garda Síochána in relation to the handling of this.

In 1346 was installed as head of state by Khwaja Shams al-Din 'Ali, the head of the pro-dervish party that had just overthrown and executed Muhammad Aytimur. Kulu Isfandiyar was considered to be a good compromise candidate; not only did the dervishes think highly of him, but his Bashtini origins (Mas'ud's family came from there) and his military credentials were thought to be sufficient to win over Mas'ud's supporters as well. Kulu Isfandiyar's reign, however, turned out to be short. The sources disagree on the nature of his downfall, but it is probable that the Bashtinis and the pro-Mas'udi factions of the army complained about the government's failure to pay them and used this as a pretext to overthrow Kulu Isfandiyar in late 1346/1347.Smith Jr.: pp. 128-129 His place was taken by Mas'ud's brother Shams al-Din ibn Fazl Allah.

Her haiku reflected the time that she and her family spent in detention in Japanese internment camps during World War II. She wrote more than a dozen books of poetry during her lifetime. Her best known works are Poetic Reflections of the Tule Lake Internment Camp, 1944, which was written nearly 50 years after her detention. She was the editor of May Sky: There Is Always Tomorrow; An Anthology of Japanese American Concentration Camp Kaiko Haiku. She was a major advocate for redress for Japanese Americans who were held in internment camps during the war. The work of Cristoforo and other activists ultimately led the United States government to make reparations and issue an official apology to the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were incarcerated during World War II. Early life de Cristoforo was born Kazue Yamane on September 3, 1917, in Ninole, Hawaii. It was a common practice for Japanese immigrants to send their children to Japan to study and spend time with relatives, and at age eight de Cristoforo was sent to Hiroshima for her primary education. She returned to the United States at thirteen, rejoining her family at their new home in Fresno, California. After graduating from high school in Fresno, she married her first husband, Shigeru Matsuda. The couple ran a Japanese bookstore and joined a haiku club in the area. By the start of World War II, de Cristoforo had established herself as a well-known poet in the kaiko style, a modernist, freestyle subgenre of haiku. World War II About a month after the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt authorized the exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast with Executive Order 9066. By the time the Matsudas were \\"evacuated\\" from their Fresno home in April 1942, the couple had two small children and de Cristoforo was pregnant with a third — and recovering from surgery to remove a tumor. The family was taken to the Fresno Assembly Center, one of fifteen temporary detention sites where Japanese Americans were held while construction on the more permanent and isolated War Relocation Authority camps was completed. There, she gave birth to her third child, in 100-degree heat and on a makeshift table made of orange crates in an \\"apartment\\" converted from a horse stall. Soon after, the family was transported to the concentration camp at Jerome, Arkansas, where they remained until the infamous \\"loyalty questionnaire\\" resulted in Matsuda's separation from de Cristoforo and their children. The War Relocation Authority had mandated all adults in camp to apply for leave clearance in 1943, regardless of whether they had requested leave or not. Initiated in order to relieve overpopulation in the camps and get an early start on post-war resettlement, the leave registration process eventually devolved into a tool to assess inmate loyalty and segregate dissidents and other \\"troublemakers.\\" Anger and confusion in response to the questionnaire were widespread, mostly directed at two questions that asked Japanese Americans to volunteer for military service (despite their earlier eviction at the hands of the army) and renounce their allegiance to Japan (despite the fact that most had never held such allegiance). Matsuda refused to respond to the two questions, and encouraged de Cristoforo to do the same; following her husband's advice, she answered only that she wished to be repatriated to Japan with her family.Woo, Elaine. \\"Violet de Cristoforo, 90; California Haiku Poet Sent to WWII Internment Camps\\" (2007-10-09) Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 2014-08-25. Matsuda, already in custody after joining a committee to investigate food shortages in Jerome, was transferred to the Justice Department internment camp at Santa Fe, New Mexico, while de Cristoforo and their three children were sent to the Tule Lake Segregation Center in northern California. Throughout her time in camp, de Cristoforo continued to write, publishing some of her haiku in camp newspapers and literary magazines. Her time in camp left a lasting imprint on her writings. Much of the original haiku that were written during her years in the camps has been lost or destroyed, however, her surviving writings and later work reflected the desolation and despair that she felt during that period. Post World War II de Cristoforo and her children were expatriated to Japan in 1946, her husband having been transported there earlier. Upon arriving in Japan, de Cristoforo discovered that her husband had remarried to a Japanese woman. She also witnessed firsthand the destruction of the atomic bomb and its effects on Japanese civilians when she went to Hiroshima to find her mother. She later described the reunion in an interview, recalling that when she found her mother wandering in the hills outside the city the severe burns the woman had suffered in the bombing made her \\"look like a monster.\\" She spent several years in post-war Japan, during which time she met her second husband, Wilfred H. de Cristoforo, an Army officer with the occupation forces. The couple moved back to the United States in 1956 and settled in Monterey, California. In addition to her writing, de Cristoforo took a publishing job at the McGraw- Hill Companies, and over the years she published a total of six books and anthologies of poetry. She played an active role in the redress movement of the 1970s and 1980s, and testified in one of the hearings of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, whose recommendations ultimately led to the passage of the landmark Civil Liberties Act of 1988. Her marriage to Wilfred lasted until his death in 1998. Honors Violet Kazue de Cristoforo was honored in Washington D.C. by the National Endowment for the Arts in September 2007, just before her death. The NEA awarded her a National Heritage Fellowship for cultural achievement for her writings. The National Heritage Fellowship Award is the highest award given in the United States to honor achievement in traditional and folk arts. Death Violet Kazue de Cristoforo died from complications from a stroke on October 3, 2007, at her home in Salinas, California. She died just two weeks after receiving the National Heritage Fellowship Award. She was 90 years old. Cristoforo was survived by two daughters, a son, and two grandchildren.

Accessed 4 July 2007. Northrop describes her childhood home as being \\"very Republican.\\" When Northrop left home to attend college in 1966, she considered herself indoctrinated into a conservative viewpoint. College proved transformative for Northrop who said \\"I’m one of those very dangerous converts – someone who discovered a radical, leftist point of view, in my late teens and sort of traveled that road, ideologically, since.\\" Northrop graduated from Vassar College in 1970. Career After college, Northrop worked for the National Journal in Washington, D.C. She reported on all branches of the federal government which included The White House, Congress and the Supreme Court.

In 1992, Northrop was the only openly lesbian or gay individual in the New York delegation to the Democratic National Convention. She served for four years as a board member of the Gay Games which were held in New York City in 1994. Northrop helped create the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies, a gay think tank, for which she also served on the board of advisors.

When Northrop became an AIDS and homosexuality educator, she \\"...realized the issues were the same that had engaged her as an activist against the Vietnam War and for the feminist movement.\\" Thus, in 1988, Northrop joined the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power in New York City, known as ACT UP/New York. She became involved in \\"direct action\\" demonstrations and was arrested approximately two dozen times for civil disobedience. In December 1989, Northrop participated in ACT UP's \\"Stop the Church\\" protest at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City by lying in the center aisle. During the action, over 4,500 activists interrupted Sunday Mass to protest the Catholic Church's opposition to AIDS prevention such as condom distribution and sex education. The documentary film How to Survive a Plague shows part of this action. She, along with 110 other protestors, was arrested.Crimp, Douglas. ACT UP New York: Capsule History ACT UP.

His courtesy title was Kaga no Kami. Biography Tadazane was born in Edo in 1782 (some sources state 1778) as the son of the 6th daimyō of Odawara, Ōkubo Tadaaki. He succeeded to headship of the Ōkubo clan and Odawara Domain upon his father’s death in 1796. During his tenure, he reformed the domain's faltering finances, particularly through his employment of the scholar Ninomiya Sontoku, who reformed the domain's taxes and encouraged development of agriculture through immigration from other domains. In 1800, Tadazane had his start in the Tokugawa administration as a Sōshaban, or Master of Ceremonies. Four years later, on January 28, 1804, he was appointed to the concurrent position of Jisha-bugyō (Magistrate of Temples and Shrines). On June 25, 1810, he became Osaka Castellan, followed by the post of Kyoto Shoshidai from April 16, 1815. As was usually the case with holders of the latter office, Tadazane became a Rōjū under the shōgun Tokugawa Ienari upon the completion of his duties in 1818 (having been recommended by Matsudaira Sadanobu). He died 19 years later, while still holding the office of Rōjū, in 1837. His grave is at the clan temple of Saisho-ji in Setagaya, Tokyo. Tadazane was married to a daughter of Hachisuka Haruaki, daimyō of Tokushima Domain, but his only son and heir Ōkubu Tadanaga died in 1831. He adopted Tadanaga's son, Tadanao as his heir.

The phenomenon is based on the differential in atmospheric pressure, directly correlated with the observer's frequency of and level of experience in high-altitude metabolism. As the external pressure decreases, the difference in pressure between the gas within the body and the atmosphere outside is higher, and the urge to expel gas to relieve the pressure is greater. Consistent with Boyle's law, controlling for dietary variance, the amount of gas produced is constant in mass, but the volume increases as the external pressure decreases. The feeling of fullness or need to expel brought on by this differential in atmospheric pressure has been verified by studies involving military pilots subjected to pressure changes simulating flight.

Dretke, 542 U.S. 274 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court was asked whether evidence of the defendant's low IQ in a death penalty trial had been adequately presented to the jury for full consideration in the penalty phase of his trial.. The Supreme Court held that not considering a defendant's low IQ would breach his Eighth Amendment rights and constitute a cruel and unusual punishment. Facts of the case Robert Tennard was convicted of capital murder by a Texas jury. Tennard and two accomplices robbed and killed two neighbors. The evidence presented at trial indicated that Tennard killed one of the victims by stabbing while his accomplice used a hatchet to kill the other victim. In the evidence phase of the trial, the defense presented evidence that Tennard's IQ was 67, a fact which the prosecution did not dispute. The prosecutors argued that Tennard's IQ was irrelevant to the case. The jury was instructed to evaluate two issues: did the defendant deliberately commit the crime, and was the defendant likely to be dangerous in the future? The jury answered yes to both questions and sentenced Tennard to the death penalty. The defense then argued that the jury instructions in the penalty phase were inadequate, and Tennard's death penalty was in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment. Questions at issue The District Court for the Southern District of Texas denied Tennard a certificate to appeal on the basis that a low IQ is not a sufficient reason for appeal there was no evidence presented that Tennard's behavior was mentally retarded and that mental retardation was related to the criminal act. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this finding. The Supreme Court granted Tennard's writ of certiorari. Issue The U.S. Supreme Court then vacated the decision and remanded it back to the Fifth Circuit for reconsideration in light of the court's contemporaneous decision in Atkins v. Virginia. The Fifth Circuit considered and rejected the Atkins claim. Tennard appealed again. The main issue the U.S Supreme Court considered was whether the Fifth Circuit improperly denied Mr. Tennard's certificate of appeal since he had presented substantial evidence of a violation of his constitutional rights, or had \\"demonstrated that reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong?\\" (quotation in original). Outcome The Supreme Court held that all relevant mitigating factors must be considered in the penalty phase of a death penalty case. It is not sufficient to allow the defendant to present mitigating factors during the trial if those factors are not considered in the sentencing. If the jury is not instructed to consider all relevant mitigating factors, the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights are violated as failure to do so constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that Tennard's IQ was a relevant mitigating factor, and that the sentencing jury should have been made to consider it for the purposes of mitigation. Ultimately, Tennard's death sentence was reduced to life in prison.http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_offenders_no_longer_on_dr.html Significance The case formed part of a series of decisions in which the Supreme Court adjusted and refined the capital sentencing methods of the various states.

The protein encoded by this gene converts UDP-glucose to UDP- glucuronate and thereby participates in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate. These glycosylated compounds are common components of the extracellular matrix and likely play roles in signal transduction, cell migration, and cancer growth and metastasis. The expression of this gene is up-regulated by transforming growth factor beta and down-regulated by hypoxia. This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways: pentose and glucuronate interconversions, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and nucleotide sugars metabolism.

Their son, Yaxun Bʼalam IV - \\"Bird Jaguar\\", succeeded his father as king. She was possibly a regent for a period. Biography Lady Eveningstar came to Yaxchila from Calakmul. She was a secondary wife to Shield Jaguar the Great (Itzamnaaj Bʼalam II).Martin & Grube 2000:122. Note that in Martin and Grube's 2nd (revised) edition of this work (2008), Itzamnaaj Bahlam's position in the dynastic sequence has changed from that given in the original edition, along with a modification to the orthography for his name (Martin & Grube 2008:122). Although a secondary wife, Lady Ikʼ Skull may have ruled for a short time in Yaxchilan's history until her son Yaxun Bʼalam IV was old enough to take the throne.Josserand 2007 A review of the dynastic history of Yaxchilan during Itzamnaaj Bahlam's reign indicates that he had three wives: his aunt Lady Xoc, Lady Sak Bʼiyaan and Lady Ikʼ Skull, with Lady Xoc as the primary wife.Martin & Grube 2008:126 Upon the death of Itzamnaaj Bahlam, the right to the throne would traditionally go to his heir through Lady Xoc's line; however, this is not what happened and nearly ten years after his death it is his son from Lady Ikʼ Skull that took the throne.Josserand 2007:299. There is a great deal of speculation as to why the son of a secondary wife took the throne and did so after the king had been dead for ten years. The current thinking is that the rightful heir through Lady Xook's lineage may have been her son, or perhaps a nephew or brother,As is suggested by Martin and Grube (2008:127). but that this individual was captured during a conflict with Dos Pilas in 745.Josserand 2007:307. Information regarding this \\"interregnum\\" period tends to be conflicting. In their second revised edition, Martin and Grube note that at Piedras Negras there is mention of a new king at Yaxchilan, Yopaat Bahlam II, who may have ruled for part or all of this period. However, supporting evidence for this is unknown from Yaxchilan. On the other hand, Josserand notes that Lady Ikʼ Skull ruled as regent during this time and that it was not until her death that Bird Jaguar IV took the throne.

Product lines  RMI had four product lines: three developed internally and one acquired. The XLR (introduced circa 2005) was a multicore, multithreaded CPU used for network processing. XLR integrated circuits had 2 to 8 MIPS architecture CPU cores, each extended to support 4 hardware threads. XLR processors included HyperTransport, PCI-X, Gigabit Ethernet, and IEEE floating point unit per core and optionally 10 Gigabit Ethernet interconnects. Alt URL A 2.0 GHz clock rate for the XLP was announced in May 2009. The XLS was a smaller, lower-cost multicore multithreading MIPS-based CPU used for network processing. The XLS family had options with 1 or 2 CPU cores, each with 4 hardware threads; 2 to 8 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces or two 10-gigabit Ethernet interfaces; and 1 or 2 PCI-Express interfaces. The XLS processor was widely used in Huawei's LTE base stations. The Alchemy processor was originally developed by Alchemy Semiconductor, which was then purchased by AMD. This product line was purchased by RMI in 2006. The Alchemy processor is a low-power MIPS architecture system-on-a-chip with integrated graphics and signal processing, designed for media players and portable video devices.RMI Alchemy Au1200 Processor, accessed November 3, 2008 The Orion network interface chip was used to translate Gigabit Ethernet data traffic to synchronous optical networking (SONET/SDH) Optical Carrier OC-48 network links and back again, to connect local area networks with wide area network circuits.

Plot John Barratt (Alec Guinness), a lonely, discontented teacher of French at a British university, vacations in France. There, by chance, he meets his double, French nobleman Jacques De Gué (Guinness again). They become acquainted. Barratt becomes drunk and accepts De Gué's invitation to share his hotel room. When he wakes up the next morning, Barratt finds himself alone in the room, with his clothes and passport missing. De Gué's chauffeur Gaston (Geoffrey Keen) shows up to take his master home, and Barratt is unable to convince him that he is not the nobleman. Gaston calls Dr. Aloin (Noel Howlett), who diagnoses the Englishman as suffering from schizophrenia. A bewildered Barratt allows himself to be taken to De Gué's chateau, where he meets \\"his\\" family: daughter Marie-Noel, wife Françoise (Irene Worth), sister Blanche (Pamela Brown) and formidable mother, the Countess (Bette Davis). None of them believe his story - it appears that De Gué is a malicious liar - so Barratt resigns himself to playing along. As time goes on, he feels needed, something missing in his sterile prior life. The next day, brother-in-law Aristide (Peter Bull) discusses business with him. Later, in the nearby town, Barratt is nearly run down by De Gué's mistress, Béla (Nicole Maurey), on her horse. He spends the usual Wednesday afternoon tryst getting acquainted with her. The next time they meet, before he can confess the truth, she informs him that she has already guessed it. Barratt delves into the neglected family glass-making business. He decides to renew a contract with the local foundry, even on unfavourable terms, to avoid throwing the longtime employees out of work. The Countess is upset by his decision and mentions a marriage contract. When Barratt investigates, he learns that Françoise's considerable wealth, tied up by her businessman father, would come under his control if she were to die. Françoise finds him reading the contract and becomes very upset, accusing him of wanting to see her dead. Barratt consoles her by telling her that the contract can be changed. He begins to suspect the reason for De Gué's disappearance. One day, Barratt receives a message from Béla. He goes to see her and spends a pleasant afternoon with her, though she denies having sent for him. When he returns to the chateau, he learns that Françoise has died from a fall. Blanche accuses Barratt of murder, stating that she overheard him with his wife in her room just before her death. However, Gaston provides an unshakable alibi, having driven Barratt to his rendezvous with Béla. Barratt is not surprised when De Gué resurfaces shortly afterward. They meet in private; the Frenchman demands his identity back, but Barratt refuses. Both men have come armed and shots are exchanged. Barratt emerges victorious and returns to his new life and Béla.

Based on the eponymous classic story by Na Do-hyang, the film became known for its erotic subject matter, made possible by the government's gradual relaxation of censorship and control over the film industry during the 1980s. It was part of the wave of \\"Folk erotic\\" films that had become popular in South Korea at this time. Plot An-hyeop, a beautiful young woman, lives in a small village in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Her husband, Sam-bo, is a traveling gambler who returns home for short periods after months away. During his long absences, An-hyeop earns food, money and other goods by picking mulberry leaves (ppong in Korean) for a neighbor who raises silk- worms, and also by having sex with nearly every male in the village. Angered by An-hyeop's influence over their husbands, the village women conspire to drive her away, first by beating her, and then by convincing the village elder expel her. When the elder visits An-hyeop's home to convince her to leave, she instead wins him over to her side by seducing him. The only man An-hyeop refuses to have sex with is Sam-dol, the village servant. Frustrated and infuriated, Sam-dol retaliates by telling An-hyeop's husband about her sexual promiscuity when he returns to the village. Sam-bo, An-hyeop's husband, reacts by beating Sam-dol for his verbal abuse of his wife. As Sam-bo again leaves to gamble, An-hyeop is again left to fend for herself, gathering mulberry leaves. The film closes with a lively, humorous ode to Spring ( - bom) and mulberry ( - ppong).Synopsis based on , and Mulberry, 'Ppong' (1986) (2005) DVD, viewed October 23, 2007.  Cast  * Lee Mi-sook as An-hyeop * Lee Dae-geun as Sam- dol * Lee Moo-jeong as Kim Sam-bo  Background  Essentially a melodramic sex-farce, Lee Young-il, in his History of Korean Cinema (1988) points out that the film \\"depicts the agony of life under Japanese rule through sexual jests.\\" Min, et al. write that the film symbolically shows that, with the husband gone to work with the Independence Movement, there was not much else going on in small villages during the Japanese Occupation but sex. Mulberry was shot on location at Bossam Village, a small, traditional site in Samdong, Ulsan, which was also used in director Im Kwon-taek's Surrogate Womb (씨받이 - Ssibaji) (1986), a film which helped to bring international attention to the South Korean cinema. The Korean cinematic \\"tough guy\\" of the era, Lee Dae-geun played the role of the servant, Sam-dol, who is the one man in the village with whom An-hyeop will not have sex. Lee became a sex symbol through his role in the film, which caused the actor some consternation. He states that he had appeared in the film for its literary qualities. Because the erotic elements of the film upstaged the literary aspects in the public eye, he refused to appear in the first sequel, Mulberry 2 (뽕 2 - Ppong 2, 1988).

It debuted at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival (as East Broadway). New York magazine called the film one of the two best entries in the \\"New York, New York\\" competition that year. Plot synopsis Grace Tang (Fay Ann Lee) is an ambitious Wall Street investment banker raised in New York's Chinatown. Though she has achieved financial success and stability as a mergers and acquisitions associate, Grace still yearns for social acceptance among the Upper East Side elite. When she is finally invited to her first high-end soiree, a Junior Committee meet-and-greet for a prestigious opera company, she is accidentally mistaken for an heiress from Hong Kong, also named Grace Tang. Her efforts to correct the mistake lose some of their forcefulness when she is subsequently introduced to handsome Andrew James Barrington Jr. (Gale Harold), who is dating committee-member Kay Douglas (Stephanie March). From a chance meeting in the street to dinner at a Chinese restaurant, the two begin to see more of each other, and Grace's personal, professional, and family interests become increasingly entangled and conflicting. Andrew, the son of a prominent attorney (Roger Rees), works in the New York State Attorney General's office in Manhattan, and has been passionately pursuing a case against a network of Chinatown sweatshops — in one of which Grace's mother works. Grace, unable to extricate herself gracefully from what she saw initially as an innocuous white lie, finds herself pretending that her parents are an old couple whom she visits as a volunteer. Meanwhile, Andrew Sr. is helping to shepherd a fashion-company buyout at Grace's bank, with a company that exploits sweatshop works. Grace finds herself secretly caught in the middle. When her brother Ming (Ken Leung) inadvertently reveals the truth to Andrew, Andrew leaves the budding romance, of which Kay is unaware. With Grace's help, however, Andrew gets documents that prove the fashion company's sweatshop connection, which causes the company's and his father's downfalls. Andrew leaves Kay to move to Hong Kong, where Grace has a new position with her company.

It is distributed across the sub-tropical and tropical farming belt of Australia. As a free monthly publication the magazine fills a niche between weekly newspapers and subscription-based monthly magazines. The headquarters is in Brisbane. While Blue’s (as it is commonly known) does cover news and current events the bulk of the magazine covers community interest pieces (including letters, humour and bush ‘yarns’), equipment and product information – it also has a stable of regular columnists. The magazine is unusual in that it prides itself as being specifically biased toward primary producers. The mascot of the publication, the eponymous 'Blue' who forms the apostrophe in the magazine's masthead, is a Blue Heeler. History Blue's was initiated as four page 'Mail Bag' in September 1986, but was transformed to magazine format by the then publisher Paul Townsend in October 1987. The next publisher, MB Johnson Holdings Pty Ltd, purchased the magazine in June 1991. In this period the magazine expanded to its present position in the marketplace. Publishing Services Australia (later PSA Media) took over publishing in 2000 and expanded circulation into northern NSW while giving Blue’s a presence online. In 2007 the magazine became part of the Trader Business Media magazine stable in ACP's Trader International division. In 2013 Bauer Media Group acquired the title. Circulation  Blue’s is the largest circulating rural publication per issue in Queensland and the third largest in Australia. Initially circulation was 10,000 copies per issue and restricted to distribution in north Queensland. This was increased with the Aug/Sept 1993 issue to 19,000 copies per issue (CAB audit 18,438 copies per issue) and expanded to cover central Queensland and the Northern Territory. As of late 2008 Blue’s distributes 45,466 copies (CAB audit).

This enzyme participates in c21-steroid hormone metabolism. 20alpha-HSD has been initially described as a progesterone metabolizing enzyme of the ovary. On a functional level, ovarian 20alpha-HSD is actively involved in the control of progesterone homeostasis in pregnancy of rats and mice. While 20alpha-HSD expression and activity is downregulated in the corpus luteum of pregnancy, 24 hrs prior to parturition ovarian 20alpha-HSD activity is acutely stimulated. Accordingly, in mice with targeted deletion of the 20alpha-HSD gene, progesterone blood concentration remain high throughout pregnancy which results in a delay of 2–4 days in parturition. Indicating that expression of 20alpha-HSD activity is mandatory for the induction of parturition through reduction of progesterone blood concentration. In mice, 20alpha-HSD is also expressed in the adrenals, kidneys, brain, thymus, T cells and bone marrow. Its induction in hematopoietic cells was used as an assay for the identification of T cell derived factor interleukin-3. In addition, the enzyme reduces and inactivates 17-deoxycorticosterone, the precursor of aldosterone and corticosterone.

Arianespace launched Intelsat 2, using an Ariane 4 rocket, flight number V65, in the Ariane 44L H10+ configuration. The launch took place from ELA-2 at the Centre Spatial Guyanais at 23:05:32 UTC on 8 July 1994. The satellite was placed into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, from which it raised itself into geostationary orbit by means of an R-4D-11-300 apogee motor. Intelsat 2 was removed from geostationary orbit in February 2011, being placed into graveyard orbit on 28 February. Manoeuvring into graveyard orbit did not fully deplete the satellite's propellant as had been expected, so engineering operations continued until July 2011 in order to exhaust the remaining supply.
