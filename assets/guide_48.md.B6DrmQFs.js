It is located at 137 Bond Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.http://www.ryerson.ca/studentservices/housing/resaccommodations/okeefehouse/ The building was a student residence from 1964 to 2018, and had 33 residents on three floors.  History  The land at what is today 137 Bond Street was sold to a dry goods importer by the name of William Mathers on April 14, 1855. Along with the land, Mathers received the not yet completed, golden-bricked house. The building would host its most prominent proprietor in 1879 when it was purchased by Eugene O'Keefe. He was attracted to the house at the corner of Bond and Gould because he could keep tabs on his neighbouring brewery and reside within a block of St. Michael's Cathedral. To accommodate his growing family, O'Keefe had the third floor added in 1889. O'Keefe lived at 137 Bond Street until his death on the night of September 30, 1913, in his second-floor bedroom.http://www.okeefehouse.com/history/history.php The house eventually was purchased by Longman's Publishing and converted to administrative space. The layout that can be found today can trace its origin to these offices. The Canadian Congress of Labour, the United Mine Workers and the Canadian Railroad Employees all utilized the Bond Street building at one point or another. On March 6, 1963, S.E. Lyons and Son Realty Limited sent a letter to Ryerson principal Howard H. Kerr offering the premises at Bond and Gould for $85,000. Kerr struck a deal at $80,000, a stark contrast from its $6,000 value in 1880 or the $677,000 price-tag for a summer 2004 renovation.http://www.okeefehouse.com/history/history.php In time for the fall semester of 1964, Ryerson opened “The Bond Street Annex” along with other new residencies on Church Street and Oakham House, then known as Kerr Hall. Time saw the demolition of the Church Street residencies, and Oakham House was shut down as a residence for lack of fire code compliance. From 1963 through to the construction of Pitman Hall in 1991, O’Keefe was Ryerson’s only official residence space.http://www.okeefehouse.com/history/history.php 2013 marked the 50th anniversary of O'Keefe House as a Ryerson residence. In 2018, with the opening of the new HOEM residence on Jarvis Street, Ryerson announced that the building would no longer house students from the 2018-19 academic year. Instead, the building will be used by the university for non-residential purposes.  Notable O'Keefers  Ryerson grads Louis Gonsalves and Ted Brock were paired together as the first house supervisors. Gonsalves resided at Bond House with his wife Christine and house cat Heathcliff, marking the beginning of a long and sometimes tumultuous relationship between residents and the animal kingdom. Ted Brock Brock made innumerable contributions to Bond and O’Keefe House as Senior Don. He always demonstrated his care and concern for his resident students as their mentor, tutor, advocate, and occasionally as their disciplinarian. Brock also encouraged students to join him as volunteer philanthropists to raise money to help others in our community, whether selling tickets for Ernie’s Bursary Hot Dog Days or by seeking sponsorships for the Ronald MacDonald Snow-Shovel team. He led successful campaigns to thwart plans to demolish the house in the early 1990s. His legacy continues in the community stewardship, strong spirit and sense of identity held amongst Bond and O'Keefe House residents to this day. Ted Brock Memorial Award In 2004, the Ted Brock Memorial Award was established to honour Brock's contribution and dedication to Bond and O'Keefe House. Each year, this award recognizes an outstanding O'Keefe House resident at the year end formal who has made great contributions to the House during his or her time there. Originally named the Ted Brock Recognition Award to honour his retirement as Senior Don of O'Keefe House, the award was renamed the Ted Brock Memorial Award after his death in 2006. Erica Antonitti In 2018, Ryerson said goodbye to O'Keefe House as a residence. Leaving Antonitti as the last House President O'Keefe will ever see. Traditions There have been innumerable traditions at O'Keefe since its inception as a residence in 1964, however there have been a few prominent traditions that have lasted for many years. The Wine & Cheese Semi Formal, Food Olympics, Fort Building, End of the Year Formal, Alumni v. Frosh Football, Tour Du O'Keefe, Volunteering with the Ronald McDonald House, The Fred Victor Centre Dinner and many traditions. Legacy O'Keefe is known for being a tight-knit community of residents upholding decades old traditions. Additionally participation in intramural athletics has been a prominent part of O'Keefe's heritage, winning the Ryerson Athletics Centre, Residence Challenge award 10 consecutive years in a row since its creation. The O'Keefe House Alumni Association continues to grow, with the primary objective to preserve O'Keefe's heritage and strengthen the ties between O'Keefe Alumni. In 2008 the Alumni Association celebrated the 45th O'Keefe House Anniversary and in fall 2013 will celebrate the 50th O'Keefe House Anniversary. alt= O'Keefe House Logo. Leadership O'Keefe House is now run by Ryerson Student Housing Services. Typically there are two Dons (designated Residence Advisor and Academic Link) and five seniors who serve to run the house. The seniors are often first year residents selected to return to the house serving first as R.O.C. members (Ryerson Orientation Crew) and then continuing to assist with in-house events throughout the year. A Graduate Advisor (GA) also lives in the house, working to plan events in all of Ryerson's residences.

At that time these islands were part of the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea. A platoon of Australian commandos from the 1st Independent Company was located at Buka Airfield when the Japanese landed but did not contest the invasion. The Japanese invaded in order to construct naval and air bases to provide security for their major base at Rabaul, New Britain and to support strategic operations in the Solomon Islands. After the occupation of Buka and Bougainville, the Japanese began constructing a number of airfields across the island. The main airfields were on Buka Island, on the nearby Bonis Peninsula and at Kahili and Kieta, while naval bases were also constructed at Buin in the south and on the nearby Shortland Islands.Murray 2001, pp. 169–195; Spector 1985, pp. 152–53. These bases allowed the Japanese to conduct operations in the southern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the US and the Southwest Pacific Area. In November 1943, allied forces landed on the west coast of Bougainville as part of the latter stages of Operation Cartwheel, and began building air bases to assist in the isolation and neutralization of Rabaul. U.S. Marines landed at Cape TorokinaKeogh 1965, p. 414. and established a beachhead within which the Allies eventually constructed three airfields.

His most notable race wins were the 1902 Epsom Derby on Ard Patrick and the 1903 2,000 Guineas on Rock Sand. Martin's technique was often at odds with racing authority rules, his license being suspended several times, and his early career was marred by allegations of cheating and underhanded gambling practices.New York Times. \\"A column for race-goers.\\" May 28, 1899. Early life and U.S. racing career Martin was born on January 25, 1875 in Titusville, Pennsylvania.Ancestry Library, from 1916 U.S. passport application. Roll 0285 - Certificates: 14701-15100, 10 Jan 1916-13 Jan 1916. His family relocated to Santa Clara, California in the late 1880s and young Martin began an apprenticeship at the local racetrack when he was 15.James Forman Sloan. Tod Sloan-by himself. Riverside Press, Edinburgh. 1915. He was first an exercise rider for Mr. Appleby and was then employed by D. Smith. His first race win was in 1896 aboard the 100:1 long shot La Mascota owned by John G. Follansbee.The Evening News- San Jose. \\"Former Santa Clara rider becomes famous jockey.\\" January 2, 1903. Weighing only 80 lbs and standing at barely five feet tall, Martin soon acquired the nickname of \\"Skeets\\" because he looked like a tiny mosquito while riding a large Thoroughbred. In 1897, he won the Brooklyn Handicap on Howard Man while racing for George E. Smith, the notorious gambler called \\"Pittsburgh Phil.\\" Smith also employed Tod Sloan, and the two were often pitted against each other on Smith's mounts. Pittsburgh Phil considered Sloan to be the better of his two jockeys and would often put Martin on his less successful horses.New York Times. \\"Suburban for Dwyer.\\" June 23, 1897. In late 1897, Martin was widely criticized in the Eastern horse racing circuit for lackluster riding performances and failing to meet contractual obligations for many of his clients.New York Times. \\"Jockey Martin fails to keep his engagements to ride six horses.\\" October 14, 1897. These slights cost him dearly and he was not contracted for much of the 1898 season by any of the major Thoroughbred owners. In 1899, Martin was contracted to ride for John Daly and the Dwyer Brothers, notably securing second place on Half-Time in a rousing nose-to-nose finish with Jean Bereaud at the Belmont Stakes. But despite his successes, Martin was dropped from Daly's employ in May 1899 due to a pervasive rumor that he had thrown a race that would have won Daly $15,000. By 1899, Martin (at the age of 23) had won 269 out of 1257 mounts, with 242 seconds and 181 thirds in his short US career. While the allegations of cheating effectively ended his U.S. career, there was ample opportunity for success abroad as many American horsemen were expanding their racing interests overseas and British horsemen were in need of unconventional jockeys. He traveled to the UK in early 1899 on the advice of his friend and fellow jockey Tod Sloan.New York Times. \\"American jockey praised.\\" February 3, 1918. Career in the United Kingdom Skeets Martin (left) and Tod Sloan at 200px First season In June 1899, Martin became part of the \\"American invasion\\" of jockeys that greatly influenced and dominated British horse racing in the early twentieth century. Together with Danny Maher, Tod Sloan, Lester Reiff and John Reiff, Martin garnered many racing wins and dazzled the British public with his aggressive racing tactics and forward-seated posture. While colloquially known as \\"Skeets\\" in the United States, he did not race under that name in Britain, opting instead for the more prosaic sounding \\"J.H.

Sloan and Martin, in the company of bicyclist and future racecar driver, Eddie Bald, returned to the United States in December 1899 due to the curtailing of turf events at the outbreak of the Second Boer War. Both jockeys returned to the UK for the start of the 1900 season in March. 1900-1902 Returning for the 1900 season, Martin won the Brocklesby Stakes and Doddington Plate in March, but his aggressive riding style often led to trouble. He was suspended by the Jockey Club for foul riding from May to June due to his being disqualified in the Spring Two-Year-Old Plate at Kempton Park.New York Times. \\"American Jockeys win again.\\" May 16, 1900. He followed this suspension with wins at the Triennial Stakes, Northumberland Plate, Wilton Plate, Autumn Breeder's Foal Plate and Stainsby Selling Plate. The Jockey Club refused to renew Martin's license for the 1901 season due to his continued disregard for racing etiquette and rough riding style.New York Times. \\"Why Martin's license was refused.\\" March 24, 1901. Tod Sloan's license was also permanently revoked, ending his racing career. Consequently, Martin obtained a license for racing in Germany during the 1901 season, winning the Spring Handicap at Cologne in AprilNew York Times. \\"Martin won on German track.\\" April 15, 1901. and finishing second in the Eclipse Stakes under a foreign license. His UK license was reinstated in 1902. In June 1902, Martin rode J.

He finished the 1902 season with a second-place finish on Volodyovski at the Coronation Cup and won the Princess of Wales's Stakes on Veles.

In 1906, Martin won the Brighton Derby in the United States and was third in the Epsom Derby on Troutbeck and at the Eclipse Stakes with Wombwell. Martin won the Lincolnshire Handicap in 1908. He raced for the stable of Harry Payne Whitney and Louis Winans in 1909 and was Sir Martin's jockey when the colt fell on Tattenham Corner at the Epsom Derby, throwing and injuring Martin. He again rode Sir Martin in the 1909 Cambridgeshire Handicap where the colt lost to Christmas Daisy and Mustapha, but Martin did win the Coronation Cup on Sir Martin in 1910. Later career Martin twice won the King's Stand Stakes with the gelding Hornet's Beauty in 1911 and 1913. At the onset of World War I in 1914, Martin and his wife Florence left their residence in Newmarket and moved to California, returning to the UK in 1916. Martin was the second leading jockey in Britain in 1917, riding 32 winners. Martin retired from racing in the early 1920s. Vanity Fair caricature of Martin done by Roland L'Estrange (a.k.a. Ao).

It was the first book written by travel author Peter Jenkins, with support from the National Geographic Society. The book depicts his journey from Alfred, New York, to New Orleans, Louisiana. While on his journey of self-discovery, he engaged himself in others' lives, lost his best friend, experienced a religious conversion, and courted a new wife. The book would lead to a sequel, as well as a writing career. Synopsis Peter Jenkins was raised in a northern middle-class suburban home in Connecticut.Jenkins, pp. 15-16. While attending Alfred University, he contracted an early marriage despite his sympathies for the new hippie youth movement and its belief in free love. He graduated on 30 May 1973, feeling stifled by both his environment and his marriage.Jenkins, pp. 18-22. After separating from his wife, he cast about for an escape. He decided that despite his dislike of his native land, he would meet its citizens by walking from his college town of Alfred to the Gulf of Mexico before continuing across the United States. On 15 October 1973, he shouldered his pack, whistled up his dog Cooper, and began walking south. He planned to stop and work during his journey whenever he needed money.Jenkins, pp. 25-36. Jenkins' trip to the Gulf saw him lay over for the winter in Appalachia before he continued south. He worked at various laboring jobs, such as sawmill hand, as money was needed.Jenkins, pp. 155-161, 171-172. As a hippie Damnyankee outsider, Jenkins sometimes met with suspicion and hostility. More often, he was greeted with hospitality from those from whom he least expected it. On occasion, initial hostility from others morphed into good will and friendship.Jenkins, pp. 121, 246-250, 260-267. Jenkins was invited to stay in the home of various good samaritans, including an Appalachian hermitJenkins, pp. 175-190. and an African-American family. On occasion, he lived with these samaritans for considerable lengths of time; his stay with the African-American family lasted several months.Jenkins, pp. 129-154, 171-182, 186-195. At one of his stays, at The Farm hippie commune in Tennessee, Cooper was run over and killed by a truck. After burying Cooper, he sorrowfully continued his hike solo, headed for Alabama.Jenkins, pp. 197-234. Once there, he met Governor George Wallace; Wallace alerted state employees to keep a helpful lookout for Jenkins.Jenkins, pp. 253-256. Jenkins then attended a revival meeting in Mobile run by James Robison and embraced the Christian faith.Jenkins, pp. 274-288. Jenkins ended his trek in New Orleans, where he courted his new wife Barbara while they were living in a seminary. After some self-doubt as to her fitness to hike with him to the west coast, Barbara joined him in his journey. Themes A young man's process of coming of age and self-discovery are the themes of A Walk Across America. Realizing that his point of view is limited by his suburban rearing, Jenkins is determined to learn more about other American lifestyles. His route takes him into the American South, a region reputed for racial and social prejudice; because he is an outsider, this makes him apprehensive. However, he was befriended by, and befriended, a wide array of people living outside his cultural ken.Jenkins, entirety. His travels on his personal odyssey added to the tension, whether nearly dying of influenza in an Appalachian Trail shelter,Jenkins, pp. 116-118. being threatened by prejudiced lawmen or rednecks,Jenkins, 119-124, 167-172. or menaced by wide trucks on a narrow bridge.Jenkins, pp. 295-296. Jenkins concluded his book with his own personal summary: \\"I started out searching for myself and my country, and found both.\\"Jenkins, p. 294. Publication details Jenkins walked into the National Geographic Society's office in Washington early in his trip seeking support. The Society supplied him with a camera and lenses, and advised him of their interest in the book.Jenkins, pp. 54-58. He began writing an article for them when he got to New Orleans in 1975.Jenkins, p. 302. Jenkins began writing A Walk Across America in Winter, 1976 while on a ranch in the Rocky Mountains; he completed the book in Ouray, Colorado in 1978.Jenkins, pp. 319-320. Published in 1979, A Walk Across America was into its sixth edition within a year, as it spent three months on the New York Times bestseller list.Cover copy on sixth edition. It was a selection of both the Newsweek Condensed Book Club and Reader's Digest Condensed Books.

He joined the University of Chicago faculty in 2008. His scholarly writings have been primarily in legal philosophy and Continental philosophy, especially Nietzsche and Marx.

He is founding editor of a book series entitled Routledge Philosophers, and (with Leslie Green) of Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Law. He is also a prolific blogger. Leiter was also the founder and for 25 years the editor of the Philosophical Gourmet Report (\\"PGR\\"), an influential but also controversial ranking of philosophy PhD programs in the English-speaking world. After repeated protests, one in 2002 and one in 2014, Leiter retired and turned over editorship of the PGR to Berit Brogaard, a philosopher at the University of Miami, and Christopher Pynes, a philosopher at Western Illinois University.https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/04/philosophical- gourmet-report-2017-18.html Education and career Born to a Jewish family,Washington Post: \\"\\"Mondoweiss\\" is a hate site (Update)\\" by David Bernstein May 4, 2015 Leiter earned his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Princeton University (1984), and his J.D. (1987) and Ph.D. (in philosophy; 1995) from the University of Michigan, where his dissertation was supervised by Peter Railton. Leiter taught for two years at the University of San Diego School of Law, and was a visiting assistant professor of philosophy at the University of California, San Diego, before joining the faculty at the University of Texas School of Law in 1995, where he taught until 2008. At Texas, Leiter was founder and Director of the Law and Philosophy Program. In 2008, Leiter moved to the University of Chicago, where he is now Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago Law School, and founder of Chicago's Center for Law, Philosophy & Human Values. Leiter has been a visiting professor of law or philosophy at Yale Law School, University College London, University of Chicago Law School, University of Paris X-Nanterre, University of California, San Diego, and Oxford University. He edited the journal Legal Theory from 2000 to 2008, and is editor of the Routledge Philosophers, a series of introductions to major philosophers, and (with Leslie Green) of Oxford Studies in the Philosophy of Law. Author Walter K. Olson described Leiter as \\"left-leaning\\" in his book Schools for Misrule: Legal Academia and an Overlawyered America (Encounter Books, 2011). and Leiter himself has professed sympathy for Marx, stating in an interview that, \\"On two central issues, Marx was far more right than any of his critics: first, that the long-term tendency of capitalist societies is towards immiseration of the majority (the post-WWII illusion of upward mobility for the \\"middle classes\\" will soon be revealed for the anomaly it was); and second, that capitalist societies produce moral and political ideologies that serve to justify the dominance of the capitalist class.\\"  Philosophical work  Leiter's scholarly writings have been in two main areas—legal philosophy and Continental philosophy—although he has also written about metaethics, religious liberty, and other topics. Philosophical naturalism has been a major theme in both contexts. Legal philosophy In legal philosophy, Leiter has offered a reinterpretation of American Legal Realism as embodying a prescient philosophical naturalism and a defense of what he called \\"naturalized jurisprudence\\" in his book Naturalizing Jurisprudence: Essays on American Legal Realism and Naturalism in Legal Philosophy (Oxford University Press, 2007). Upon publication, Jeremy Horder wrote that the \\"book will confirm Brian Leiter 's place in the front rank of legal theorists in the world today.\\" Leiter also wrote the entry on \\"Naturalism in Legal Philosophy\\" for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. On his view, \\"philosophers generally should aim to unpack the 'concepts that have been vindicated by their role in successful explanation and prediction of empirical phenomena'\\" and thus should \\"'take seriously the…social scientific literature on law…to see what concept of law figures in the most powerful explanatory and predictive models of legal phenomena such as judicial behavior.' This methodological view, however, raises questions about why the legal philosopher should study only judicial behavior and not something else. More generally, the naturalist owes an account of what features of law are most in need of explication and why.\\" Continental philosophy Leiter is also a scholar of Continental philosophy, and is co-editor with Michael E. Rosen of The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy. He has written a considerable amount on the philosophical work of Friedrich Nietzsche, including an article for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. In particular, Leiter defended a reading of Nietzsche as a philosophical naturalist in his Nietzsche on Morality (London: Routledge, 2002) and in later papers, including one with Joshua Knobe on \\"The Case for Nietzschean Moral Psychology\\" in Nietzsche and Morality (Oxford University Press, 2007). In 2014, when student members of the University College London Union Council informed the \\"Nietzsche Club\\" that it could no longer declare an affiliation with the school, because the club was promoting \\"far-right\\" and \\"fascist\\" ideologies, Leiter first defended the club, saying Nietzsche was not a fascist, but later noted that if the club is a front for a fascist group, then it's a shame that Nietzsche was smeared as a fascist in the discussion. Other work Leiter's most recent book, Why Tolerate Religion?, published by Princeton University Press, has proved controversial. The political philosopher John Gray wrote, \\"A model of clarity and rigour and at points strikingly original, this is a book that anyone who thinks seriously about religion, ethics and politics will benefit from reading.\\" Christopher L. Eisgruber, the President of Princeton University, said. \\"Every reader will learn something from this remarkable book, and, beginning now, every serious scholar of religious toleration will have to contend with Leiter's bold claims.\\" By contrast, the website of the conservative Family Research Council said the book was \\"one of the most troubling and intellectually discreditable books by a serious American scholar in some time.\\" The book was named an \\"Outstanding Academic Title\\" by Choice in 2013.http://www.cro3.org/content/51/05/759.extract Leiter has also published work on meta-ethics, social epistemology, the law of evidence, and on philosophers Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger, and Ronald Dworkin.  Philosophical Gourmet Report and other academic rankings  In 1989, while he was a graduate student Leiter made a list of what he believed to be the top 25 graduate philosophy programs in the United States.. Called the Philosophical Gourmet Report, this list came to be known as \\"the Leiter Report\\" and has been internationally recognized. It is now published by Wiley-Blackwell, and while being controversial, it is the foremost ranking of graduate programs in philosophy in the English-speaking world. The PGR was described by David L. Kirp in a 2003 New York Times op-ed as \\"the bible for prospective [philosophy] graduate students.\\" George Yancy, in Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge (SUNY Press, 2012), opined that Philosophical Gourmet Report ranking: \\"is, of course, very controversial. However, as is often pointed out, there is no real alternative.\\" Carlin Romano, in America the Philosophical (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2013), referred to the PGR rankings as \\"often-criticized\\" and \\"biased towards mainstream analytic departments\\" although it covers Continental philosophy as well. In 2002, nearly 300 philosophers signed an open letter calling on Leiter to stop producing the PGR.http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/04/20/the_philosopher_kingmaker/?page=3 In fall 2014, over 600 philosophers signed a petition to boycott the PGR organized by some philosophers at University of British Columbia to protest what they called a \\"derogatory and intimidating\\" e-mail sent by Leiter to one of their colleagues. A majority of the Advisory Board of the PGR (30 of the 54 members) thought it best that he relinquish control over the Report's management. In response, Leiter appointed a co-editor for the 2014 report Berit Brogaard, a philosophy professor at the University of Miami and agreed to step down as editor after its publication. Leiter dismissed the criticisms as coming from people whose organizations had received a poor ranking, or from feminists he characterized as upset with his stance in favor of due process for men accused of sexual harassment. He subsequently retained a lawyer to sue the organizers of the 2014 protest for defamation. The Australian reported that > Professor Leiter ... said there had never been any impropriety in his > administration of the report but \\"if someone feels editing the PGR means > forfeiting certain expressive rights, then I accept that they have a reason > not to participate while I remain as one of the editors. And since I value > my expressive rights (including my right to express myself in ways some > others may find offensive), that gives me an additional reason to dissociate > from the PGR so that those philosophers will, I hope, participate in the > future.\\" Leiter has also edited a ranking of U.S. law schools, which The Washington Post describes as \\"well-known,\\" and was hired by Maclean's magazine in Canada to produce a ranking of Canadian law schools.Law Schools Ranked Maclean's, September 12, 2007 Blogging and other public activities Leiter is a prolific blogger, running three blogs, one on philosophy (and political commentary), one on law, and one on Nietzsche.

Completed in 1836, it is thought to be one of Delaroche's greatest masterpieces. It was displayed as part of the Bridgewater Collection in London, although it was latterly thought to have been lost when, during The Blitz of 1941, a German bomb struck close to Bridgewater House, causing shrapnel damage to the canvas in the ensuing explosion. In 2009 it was rediscovered in Scotland in an unexpectedly good condition, having been rolled up and stored after the war, but recorded in the intervening years as badly damaged or destroyed. After a partial restoration it went on display in the National Gallery in London, in an exhibition re-appraising Delaroche's work. After the exhibition, it is to be fully restored. Subject In Cromwell and Charles I painted in 1831, Delaroche also depicts Charles I, with Cromwell standing over his dead body Charles I Insulted features Charles I, the King of England, who had by 1648 lost the Second English Civil War fought against Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, after the Battle of Preston. By January 1649, he was being put on trial for treason, and on 30 January, he was beheaded. The painting depicts Charles in the days before his execution, being bullied and taunted by Cromwell's defiant troops, one of whom is blowing pipe smoke in his face. The deposed king remains calm, holding a book which he appears to have been reading. Ownership Delaroche's Charles I Insulted was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, who was known as Lord Francis Leveson-Gower until 1833 when, following the death of his father, he was created the first Earl of Ellesmere, inheriting Bridgewater House in London from his bachelor great uncle, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. The family line of the Earls of Ellesmere became the Dukes of Sutherland when, in 1963, John Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere, succeeded to the title of duke of Sutherland on the death of the 5th Duke of Sutherland with no male heir in the elder line. As of its rediscovery in 2009, the painting remained privately owned by the present Duke, Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland. The 7th Duke was the 6th Duke's cousin and heir to the Dukedom, since the 6th Duke had no children himself. History 1836 to 2009 Charles I Insulted is a large piece, painted on a canvas measuring by ., also described as being nearly three metres square. It was completed in 1836. It was first displayed at the Paris Salon of 1837, and in 1838 at the British Institution in London. The painting was then hung for decades as part of the semi-public Bridgewater Collection in Bridgewater House in London. The painting suffered serious damage during a Second World War German bombing raid on London. On 11 May 1941, during the last night and most deadly raid of what became known as The Blitz, one bomb landed on the street outside Bridgewater House, leaving a deep bomb crater. Hanging in the dining room at the time, the painting suffered extensive shrapnel damage. At least four paintings in the collection were totally destroyed in the raid, while others less damaged were eventually restored. Charles I Insulted was demounted, and rolled up, having been given a rudimentary repair using paper to hold together the largest tears. After the war, it was transported to Mertoun House in St. Boswells, Scottish Borders, the family's Scottish home, for storage. While stored safe and dry in Mertoun, over the next 68 years the existence of the painting was gradually forgotten about by its owners, and presumed by the art world to be lost as irreparably damaged in the raid. 2009 onwards The painting was rediscovered in the summer of 2009 by National Gallery curators, after they made enquiries about the painting as they prepared a Delaroche exhibition. The 2010 exhibition was to be the first major show on Delaroche to be held in Britain, aiming to re-assess the works of Delaroche, who fell out of fashion during the early 20th century, and featuring his most famous work from the National Gallery collection, The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833), which was also a rediscovered work: it had been thought lost when the Tate Gallery was flooded in 1928, and found rolled up in 1973. On 7 June 2009 at Mertoun, it was unrolled for the first time since being moved to Scotland. To the surprise of those present, the painting was largely intact, having \\"lost none of its intensity\\". The explosion damage consisted of around 200 individual tears in the canvas, which still contained plaster fragments and dust from the blast. After moving the painting to London, it was restored sufficiently to be able to be displayed in the exhibition, albeit with the shrapnel scars still visible, and \\"somewhat yellowed by a layer of discoloured varnish\\". Because the canvas had been rolled up for nearly 70 years, it had to be weighed down flat for six weeks. The tears were then stitched together, and the canvas lined. The painting's first ever public display since rediscovery was as part of the exhibition Painting History: Delaroche and Lady Jane Grey, running from 24 February to 24 May 2010. It went on display on 23 February in a separate room in the museum's free admission area, with the main part of the exhibition held in the adjacent Sainsbury Wing of the gallery. The painting is to be fully restored after the London exhibition whereupon work would start to remove the discoloured varnish and retouch the damaged areas. Reception According to the London National Gallery, it is \\"one of the great paintings on themes of English history for which Delaroche had become renowned\\", in which Delaroche was \\"able to imply striking parallels between the poignant fate of Charles and the recent course of French history\\". According to the gallery director Nicholas Penny, the rediscovery was \\"huge\\" and its redisplay would be an historic moment, describing it as \\"an extraordinarily powerful work\\", \\"one of the great French paintings\\" and by \\"one of the greatest painters\\" of the 19th century. According to Penny, Delaroche, a Frenchman, was a notable painter of Tudor and Stuart history, as a method of \\"exploring the violence and vicissitudes of the French Revolution\\" without actually portraying the events themselves, which were regarded as too recent to paint. According to the National Gallery's exhibition curator Christopher Riopelle, both Charles I Insulted and Delaroche's other painting, Marie-Antoinette Before the Tribunal, painted fifteen years later in 1851, \\"suggest episodes of the suffering of Christ\\". Riopelle added that Delaroche's \\"obsession with English royalist history\\" was \\"classic displacement of what you want to talk about but can't, because it's still so raw and recent\\", particularly referring to the execution of Louis XVI of France in January 1793, and nine months later of his Queen Marie Antoinette. Charlotte Higgins of The Guardian described it as \\"one of Delaroche's masterpieces\\", which \\"owes a debt\\" to Anthony van Dyck's famous painting of Charles I. Higgins also said that it \\"clearly references the popular artistic subject of the mocking of Christ by his guards\\". According to Arifa Akbar of The Independent, \\"Delaroche's monumental painting featuring Charles I as a Christ-like figure\\" is regarded as \\"one of Delaroche's most powerful pieces\\", commissioned at the \\"height of his fame\\". David Horspool of The Times, reflecting on the fate of Delaroche's Execution of Lady Jane Grey which was relegated to a basement, in which it was later flood damaged, due to Delaroche's falling fame, said \\"there seems no chance that [Charles I Insulted] will be rolled up and put away. Delaroche's days as the forgotten master seem to be over\\", predicting the rediscovered piece would be perhaps \\"the most exciting exhibit to go on display\\" in the 2010 National Gallery exhibition.

After their time in the band various members formed the groups: Tully, Fraternity and Southern Contemporary Rock Assembly (SCRA). Winston Harris (1941–2004) died of throat cancer, aged 63. A drummer from 1970 to 1971, Russell Dunlop (1945–2009), died after a seizure, aged 63. Richard Lockwood, flautist and saxophonist in 1968, died in 2012 of bowel cancer.  History   The Clefs  The Clefs formed in Adelaide during 1963 as an R&B; group by Winston \\"Tweed\\" Harris on keyboards. The early line-up included Michael Atkins on drums, Bruce Howe on bass guitar, Dennis Marshall on saxophone, Trevor Pridham on vocals and Les Tanner on guitar. Briefly Pat Aulton joined on co-lead vocals, and he later became a record producer. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed, \\"[they] became an in-demand dance band on the city's thriving club circuit.\\" Barrie McAskill (ex-Fabulous Drifters) replaced Aulton as co-lead vocalist in 1965 with Bev Harrell alongside Harris, Howe, Tanner, Bob Jeffrey on saxophone and Vince Jones on drums (ex-Fabulous Drifters). Harrell left the group and started her solo career, \\"[she] was one of the most popular solo singers on the mid-1960s pop scene.\\" The Clefs issued three singles in 1966, \\"I Can Only Give You Everything\\", \\"Last Night\\" and \\"A Boy Like Me\\". In early 1967 Harris quit the Clefs and travelled to Melbourne where he formed an R&B;, pop group, the Groove, with Geoff Bridgford (ex-Steve & the Board) on drums, Jamie Byrne (ex- Black Pearls, Running Jumping Standing Still) on bass guitar, Rod Stone (ex- the Librettos, Normie Rowe & the Playboys) on guitar and Peter Williams (ex- Max Merritt & the Meteors) on lead vocals and guitar. They were popular in Australia in the late 1960s; after their demise in 1971, Harris became a producer-arranger. Harris (1941–2004) died of throat cancer, aged 63.  Levi Smith's Clefs  After Harris left McAskill assumed leadership and at the suggestion of talent manager, Peter Raphael, they changed their name to Levi Smith's Clefs (a reference to Four Tops' lead singer Levi Stubbs). According to McFarlane, \\"Scottish-born Barrie McAskill earned a reputation as one of the country's pioneering soul/R&B; singers.\\" His size, commanding presence and gravely voice earned him the nickname \\"The Bear\\", and he led an ever-changing line-up of Levi Smith's Clefs from 1967 to 1972. Levi Smith's Clefs played gutsy R&B; similar to Max Merritt & the Meteors. The group provided a training ground for young musicians, including later members of: Tully, Fraternity, Southern Contemporary Rock Assembly (SCRA) and Mighty Mouse. McAskill encouraged them to improve their musicianship and to move on when they felt they had outgrown the band – about sixty performers passed through the band's ranks over the years. As a five-piece, Levi Smith's Clefs moved first to Melbourne and then in 1969 to Sydney where they took up an 18-month residency at the Whisky A-Go-Go club in Kings Cross. At that time the city was in an R&R; boom, a profitable period for live music, powered by visiting American servicemen, on leave from the Vietnam war. Some members from this era were Inez Amaya on vocals, Les Stacpool on guitar (ex-Chessmen, Merv Benton & the Tamlas), organists Ian Walsh and Michael Carlos, bassists Doug Stirling, John Blake, John \\"Yuk\\" Harrison and John Helman, and drummers Gil Matthews (ex-Max Hamilton & the Impacts) and Jimmy Thompson. Thompson had played in the second incarnation of Tony Worsley & the Fabulous Blue Jays and the Vince Maloney Sect and went on to join the formative \\"heavy\\" version of the Aztecs with Lobby Loyde (where he was, coincidentally, replaced by Matthews). Several musicians came and went more than once, and others often sat in, as Canadian- born Michael Carlos recalled in December 2000: :\\"I arrived in Sydney with my dad in July 1967. Got a gig in an amateur band, the Blues Breakers, the first night I was here, and played with them for about six months. I got a Hammond C3. Soon gave up all pretence about going to university and joined a professional band called Levi Smith’s Clefs. Worked at Whisky A-Go-Go – seven hours a night, six nights a week. It was here that I really learned how to play. The band was an Aussie institution, with members coming and going all the time. Some of the best rock and jazz musicians in the country would join for a while, or sit in for a few nights. I was the youngest and most inexperienced member, and had to learn fast. But nothing beats being surrounded by players that are all better than you.\\" In 1968 the line-up was McAskill, Amaya, Blake, Carlos, Mick Jurd on guitar, Richard Lockwood on flute and saxophone, and Robert Taylor on drums; however, at the end of the year, all except Jurd left. Blake, Carlos, Lockwood and Taylor formed Tully, a progressive rock group. They became the house band for the Australian stage production of Hair, which premiered in June 1969; Amaya joined the cast as a member of \\"the tribe\\". Richard Lockwood died in September 2012, three years after being diagnosed with bowel cancer. McAskill and Jurd were joined in Levi Smith's Clefs by John Bissett on organ, Tony Buettel on drums (ex-Bay City Union) and Bruce Howe on bass guitar. They toured Australia and recorded the group's sole album, Empty Monkey, released in March 1970 on Jimmie Stewart's Sweet Peach label. It was one of the first local albums to combine soul, R&B;, pop and progressive rock. McFarlane noticed, \\"Despite being a groundbreaking release in many ways, the album failed to take off. The stand out cut was an 11-and-a-half minute arrangement of the Beatles' 'You Can't Do That'.\\" The album provided two singles, \\"Lisa\\" (January 1970) and a cover of Junior Walker's \\"Shotgun\\" (April). Early in 1970 the line-up had changed again with Bissett, Buettel, Howe and Jurd leaving to form a rock band, Fraternity. McAskill assembled a new brass-heavy line-up of Levi Smith's Clefs. They took up residency at Chequers nightclub, playing six nights a week for twelve months, and specialised in tracks by Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chicago and Joe Cocker. Under the name Barrie McAskill's Levi Smith's Clefs, the band issued two more singles, their version of Ten Years After's \\"Love Like a Man\\" (September 1970), and \\"Gonna Get a Seizure\\" (April 1971). The released a four- track split extended play, Best of Whisky A-Go-Go on the short-lived Chart label, which was shared with two tracks by local band, Autumn. The Levi Smiths Clefs' tracks were \\"Down in the Valley\\" and \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\". Many musicians worked in the group through 1970 to 1971, including, the returning Carlos (ex-Tully) and Jeffrey on saxophone, as well as Julie Robinson on vocals (for two gigs), Bruce Howard on organ (ex-the La De Das, the Aztecs), Jim Kelly on guitar (ex-the Affair and later of Crossfire), Kiwi guitarist Billy TK (ex-Human Instinct), Ted \\"The Head\\" Yanni on guitar, John \\"Yuk\\" Harrison on bass guitar (ex-the Meteors, Genesis), Doug Stirling on bass guitar, Russell Dunlop (ex-Aesop's Fables), Allan Turnbull, Greg Henson (each successively on drums). Dunlop, Kelly and Kenny became the core of jazz-rock group, Southern Contemporary Rock Assembly (SCRA), when they left Levi Smith's Clefs in mid-1971. Dunlop left SCRA after a year to work in various groups and as a session drummer. He died in May 2009 – he had collapsed after playing a drum set at his son's wedding in Sydney – aged 63. The late 1971 line-up of McAskill, Carlos, Henson, Jeffrey and Stirling, also worked as Barrie McAskill's Bear Brigade or McAskill's Marauders. They toured to Adelaide but folded in early 1972 after Carlos and Henson the Australian production of Jesus Christ Superstar, in Sydney in May 1972. Carlos remained with the production until it closed in 1976. In early 1972 McAskill put together a short-lived group, Barrie McAskill's People, with Michael Barnes on guitar (ex-Nutwood Rug Band), Ken Firth on bass guitar (ex-Tully), Vince Melouney (ex-the Aztecs, Bee Gees, Fanny Adams, Cleves, Flite) on guitar and Kevin Murphy on drums (ex-Wild Cherries, the Aztecs, King Harvest, Chain). In mid-1972 McAskill relocated to Melbourne and revived the Levi Smith's Clefs name. This first Melbourne line-up was a quartet with Doug Stirling, Kevin Murphy and guitarist Mick Elliott. Elliott was later replaced by Les Stacpool, and McAskill added Ian Clyne on keyboards (ex-the Loved Ones, Ram Jam Big Band). By October 1972 it had changed again, with Clyne, McAskill and Murphy joined by Mal Capewell on saxophone and flute (ex-Dr Kandy's Third Eye, Dada, Company Caine), Russell Smith on trumpet and vocals (ex-Ram Jam Big Band). McAskill brought in three former members of Chain — Barry \\"Little Goose\\" Harvey on drums, Phil Manning on guitar and Barry \\"Big Goose\\" Sullivan on bass guitar. Shortly after Capewell, Clyne, Harvey, Manning, Murphy and Sullivan all left to form Mighty Mouse, which subsequently led to a reformation of Chain. Another member, electronic musician Steve Dunstan (ex-18th Century Quartet) had provided the opening and closing 'computer noises' for Company Caine's 1971 album, A Product of a Broken Reality. Levi Smith's Clefs disbanded at the end of 1972.  Afterwards  Returning to Sydney in January 1973, Barrie McAskill formed an eponymous group, McAskill, with Eddy McDonald on bass guitar, Dallas \\"Digger\\" Royall on drums, the erstwhile Doug Stirling on bass guitar and Alvin Tutin on guitar. The following year the group returned to Melbourne, with Royall joined by Ian Mawson on keyboards (ex-Company Caine), Warren Ward on bass guitar (ex-Flying Circus, Blackfeather) and Lindsay Wells on guitar (ex-Healing Force, Chain, Blackfeather). During 1975 the group included Bob Fortesque on bass guitar (ex-Blackfeather), Paul Johnson on drums, Eddie McDonald on bass guitar (ex- Avengers [New Zealand group], Bakery), Roger McLachlan on bass guitar (later in Little River Band), Howie Morgan on keyboards and Jeff Spooner on guitar. That group disbanded in 1976. McAskill returned to Adelaide in 1977 and formed a series of bands, East End Street Band, Barrie McAskill's on Fire, Barrie McAskill and Friends, Barrie McAskill's Soul Survivors, Who Dat Dere, and Topsy and the Bear. In 1978 he formed Barrie McAskill's God's Warriors & the Amazons with McLachlan on bass guitar, Spooner on guitar, Ross Hannaford on guitar, Mal Logan on keyboards and John van Boxtel on drums. Levi Smith's Clefs reunited for short-term gigs in Melbourne in 2002, 2003 and 2008 and included Barrie's wife, Jan McAskill on vocals and keyboards. An expanded version of Empty Monkey was issued on CD in 2008. According to McFarlane, Barrie McAskill, \\"is one of Aussie rock's great survivors, first and foremost a dedicated music fan, a champion of soul, R&B; and jazz, a band lead par excellence, and at the heart of the matter he is the Levi Smith's Clefs.\\"  Members  * Michael Atkins – drums (1963–65) * Trevor Pridham – lead vocals (1963) * Pat Aulton – lead vocals (1963–65) * Winston \\"Tweed\\" Harris – keyboards (1963–67) (d. 2004) * Bruce Howe – bass guitar (1963–67) * Les Tanner – guitar (1963–67) * Dennis Marshall – saxophone (1963–67) * Bev Harrell – lead vocals (1965) * Vince Jones – drums (1965–72) * Barrie McAskill – lead vocals (1965–72) * Inez Amaya – vocals (1967–68) * John Blake – bass guitar (1967–68) * Michael Carlos – organ (1967–68, 1971, 1972) * John \\"Yuk\\" Harrison – bass guitar (1967–68, 1971, 1972) * John Hellman – bass guitar (1967–68) * Bob Jeffrey – saxophone (1967–68, 1971, 1972) * Gil Matthews – drums (1967–68) * Les Stacpool – guitar (1967–68, late 1972) * Doug Stirling – bass guitar (1967–68, 1969–71, 1972) * Jimmy Thomspon – drums (1967–68) * Ian Walsh – organ (1967–68) * Mick Jurd – guitar (1968–69) * Richard Lockwood – saxophone, flute (1968) (d. 2012) * Robert Taylor – drums (1968) * John Bissett – organ (1968–69) * Tony Buettel – drums (1968–69) * Bruce Howe – bass guitar (1968–69) * Linda Cable – vocals (1969–71) * Michael Darby – drums, guitar (1969–71) * Steve Doran – organ (1969–71) * John Freeman – drums (1969–70) * Peter Karlenick – guitar (1969–71) * Steve Bowden – trumpet) 1970 * Mick Cousins – trombone (1970–71) * Ken Deacon – vocals (1970–71) * Bill Harrower – saxophone (1970–71) * Russell Dunlop – drums (1971) (d. 2009) * Bruce Howard – organ (1971) * Jim Kelly – guitar (1971) * Mick Kenny – trumpet (1971) * Ken Tate – trombone (1971) * Alan Turnbull – drums (1971) * Billy TK – guitar (1971) * Greg Henson – drums (1971, 1972) * Julie Robinson – vocals (1971, two gigs) * Ted \\"The Head\\" Yanni – guitar (1971) * Michael Barnes – guitar (1972) * Ken Firth – bass guitar (1972) * Vince Melouney – guitar (1972) * Kevin Murphy – drums (1972) * Mick Elliott – guitar (1972) * Mal Capewell – saxophone, flute (late 1972) * Ian Clyne – keyboards (late 1972) * Steve Dunstan – guitar (late 1972) * Barry Harvey – drums (late 1972) * Phil Manning – guitar (late 1972) * Barry Sullivan – bass guitar (late 1972)  Discography   Albums  * Empty Monkey (March 1970) – Sweet Peach (SPB 504)  Extended plays  * Best of the Whisky A-Go-Go (split EP shared with two tracks by Autumn, 1970)  Singles  * \\"Road Runner\\" (1969) Sweet Peach - AUS #84 * \\"Lisa\\" (January 1970) – Sweet Peach (SP 011) * \\"Shotgun\\" (April 1970) – Sweet Peach (SP 021) * \\"Take Another Little Piece of My Heart\\" (1970) * \\"Love Like a Man\\" (1970) – Chart Records (PR 202) * \\"Dancing and Drinking\\" (1971) Notes References Category:Australian rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1963 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1972 Category:1963 establishments in Australia ","title":"Levi Smith's Clefs"},{"id":"26192132","text":"Marie Galante is a 1934 American film directed by Henry King, starring Ketti Gallian and Spencer Tracy, adapted from a French novel by Jacques Deval.

Background Ephraim Akpata was born in 1927 in Edo State. He attended King's College, Lagos and went on to study law. In his book 888 Days in Biafra, Samuel Enadeghe Umweni recollects how Lawyer Akpata twice made the dangerous journey across the front lines to visit him while he was held prisoner by the breakaway Biafran troops during the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970). Akpata became a justice of the Supreme court, retiring in 1993 at the age of 65. He was appointed to head the INEC in 1998 when General Abdulsalam Abubakar's Administration established the INEC to organise the transitional elections that ushered in the Nigerian Fourth Republic on 29 May 1999. Formation of parties To avoid splits along ethnic lines, Akpata stipulated that only parties with broad-based national support would be allowed to contest the elections. He ruled that political parties must win local government electoral seats in at least ten states to qualify for the gubernatorial, state assembly, national assembly and presidential elections. Of 26 political associations, he gave provisional registration as political parties for the 1998/1999 elections to only nine, with only three parties finally qualifying to compete in the State and National elections. This caused the formation of coalitions of smaller associations, such as the Group of 34 which formed the new People's Democratic Party (PDP). Coalitions had to become genuine parties. In January 1999 Akpata said that the electoral alliance announced between the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and All People's Party (APP) \\"appeared to contravene INEC rules\\". He said the two parties wanted to \\"derive the benefits of a merger without going through with one\\". Akpata was critical of the process through which the PDP selected its candidates, saying it fell \\"short of the level of transparency expected from a democratic process.\\" Elections The INEC ran a series of elections. Local Government polls were held in December 1998, with the PDP winning 59%, the APP 25.8% and the AD 13.2% of the seats. Elections for the Governorships were held in January 1999, with the PDP winning 19 out of 35 states, the APP winning 9 states and the AD winning 6 states. The elections were largely orderly and peaceful, and Akpata said they were free and fair. The elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate were held in February 1999. In the Senate the PDP won 59 seats, the APP 29 and the AD 20. In the House, the PDP won 206 seats, the APP 74 and the AD 68. Elections were delayed due to security reasons in Akwa Ibom, Delta, Nasarawa and Rivers states. Akpata told a news conference that although generally fair, there had been some voting irregularities. In the 27 February 1999 presidential elections, the AD and APP fielded a joint candidate, Chief Olu Falae, who lost to the PDP candidate, former General and military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo gained 63% of the votes. Akpata accepted foreign election monitors from the US-based Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute, and supported their request to train thousands of local observers. Reports from these groups on the earlier elections were generally favourable, although they noted low turn out and some irregularities. Reports on later elections were more critical, describing irregularities including inflated vote returns, ballot box stuffing, altered results, and disenfranchisement of voters. After the elections, former US President Jimmy Carter sent a letter to Akapata that said \\"There was a wide disparity between the number of voters observed at the polling stations and the final results that have been reported from several states. Regrettably, therefore, it is not possible for us to make an accurate judgment about the outcome of the presidential election.\\" Olu Falae later alleged that the election was massively rigged in favour of the PDP. Justice Ephraim Akpata died on 8 January 2000 at the age of 72.

She started working alongside Vincentian nuns in a hospital in Corrientes, where she would take care of more than 6,000 hospitalized soldiers. Not a long time later, she assisted the injured in Salto, Humaitá, Curupaiti, and Asunción. A wealthy woman, Ana founded a nursing house in the Paraguayan capital, then occupied and besieged by the Brazilian Army. For that purpose, she used personal financial resources that she inherited from her family. She worked selflessly there until the end of the war. Her son Justiniano and a nephew who had enlisted as a volunteer, both died in battle. At the end of the war, in 1870, Ana returned to Brazil and received several honors, among them the distinctions of silver and humanitarian campaign medals. Emperor Pedro II granted Ana, via decree, a lifelong pension, which she used to provide education for the four orphans that she had brought from Paraguay with her. Death and homages Ana died on May 20, 1880, in Rio de Janeiro. In 1926, Carlos Chagas named the first official Brazilian school of nursing after her. Her full-body portrait, painted by Victor Meirelles, currently occupies a place of honor at the Salvador City Hall. According to the federal law number 12.105, sanctioned by acting president José Alencar on December 2, 2009, Ana Néri is now a character of the Book of the Fatherland Heroes, and will have her name added in the Pantheon of the Fatherland and Freedom, Agência Brasil. \\"Anna Nery entra para o Livro dos Heróis da Pátria\\".

The series was released in five volumes and published in China by Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company () under the title Seek Self's World and as part of the Cunren Fairy Tale series. An Ideal World was licensed by various other companies and released simultaneously with the original publisher between 2006 and 2007. The French manhua-publishing company Xiao Pan licensed the series as \\"Un Monde Idéal\\" (\\"An Ideal World\\") and Yen Press later announced at the New York Comic Con that they had licensed the series from Xiao Pan. Yen Press released it in North America as one volume called An Ideal World. An Ideal World follows the struggles of A You, a young man who, believing he has no luck, does not attempt to succeed in life even though others advise him to make his own luck. When he accidentally gets on the wrong bus, A You finds himself in the suburbs, where he takes shelter from the rain in a large tree and takes a nap. After waking up, A You happens upon the house of an old man, who sends him to an alternate world so that he may resolve his troubles. A You grows to enjoy the fantasy world and does not wish to return to his harsh reality. An Ideal World garnered mixed reception from Western critics, who objected mainly to the beginning and praised the overall story, artwork and themes. Plot A You is a troubled 19-year-old who dislikes his life; he feels that his entire life is unlucky, yet he avoids hard work and prefers to be lazy. He is encouraged by the people around him to work harder and told that he can change his life if he takes control of it, but A You refuses to accept these notions. One day, he accidentally takes the wrong bus and finds himself in the suburbs of his city. A You enjoys his time away and takes shelter inside of a large, hollow tree when it begins to rain. After taking a nap and waking up, he wanders until he comes across a small, green old man referred to as Grandpa Beard. Grandpa Beard decides to help A You with his problems and transports him to a \\"utopia\\" called Abi Port in an alternate world. Abi Port is home to several humans, anthropomorphic beings, and other creatures, some of which look similar to people A You knows in his world. A You is found by members of a circus, who invite him to join them in their act. Although he lacks experience, he finds that he can perform well and begins to develop feelings for a young performer named Anan. He meets others who give him advice on enjoying work and life, particularly the \\"Master of Universal Love\\", an anthropomorphic zebra who toiled to earn his position and helps others free of charge. After A You spends time in this world, Grandpa Beard decides that his problems are solved and returns to take him away from the imaginary world. A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually marries his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness. Release An Ideal World, authored by Weidong Chen and illustrated by Chao Peng, was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company and entitled Seek Self's World. It is part of the company's Cunren Fairy Tale series. An Ideal World was licensed by the French manhua company Xiao Pan, as well as several other companies, which released it in five volumes entitled Un Monde Idéal (\\"An Ideal World\\") from September 15, 2006 to March 14, 2007. Contracts were made that allowed for the French, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese companies to release the five volumes at the same time as the original company; French, Chinese, and Korean language editions were published through a partnership with Beijing Total Vision Culture Spreads. An Ideal World's global release was meant to aid in the development of the Chinese comic industry and create a new business model, and its release marked the first simultaneous global release for a comic. Xiao Pan also made an omnibus of the original Chinese version available for purchase. At the 2008 New York Comic Con, American-based graphic novel publisher Yen Press announced that they had acquired the rights to publish An Ideal World and would release it in full color. Rights were acquired from Xiao Pan, rather than Tian Jin Creator World Comic Co. On March 24, 2009, Yen Press released An Ideal World in North America as a single volume; at 176 pages long, the volume also includes character sketches, the additional French covers, and information on the author, illustrator, and Chinese publisher. An Ideal World was licensed for release in Mainland China by TriWorks and Zhiyin Magazine and in South Korea by the South Korean branch of Cambridge University Press. Shenjie published the series in Taiwan. At a conference held in February 2006, Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company announced that negotiations were being made to release An Ideal World in other European countries, Japan, and with traditional Chinese characters in Taiwan. Reception An Ideal World has received mixed reviews from Western critics, who generally praised the book's artwork and second half but did not like the beginning. School Library Journal's Lori Henderson reviewed An Ideal World positively; she praised the \\"Wizard of Oz feel\\" ending and the message that A You \\"controls his life, and he has the power to change it\\". Henderson called the characters \\"great\\" and the world \\"fantastic\\", also noting that the \\"cartoonish\\" and \\"exaggerated\\" artwork worked with the story. However, she remarked that the beginning of An Ideal World was \\"slow and plodding\\" and could \\"leave you wondering if it's ever going to go anywhere\\". Another School Library Journal critic, Joanna Fabicon, felt that the lessons and themes were \\"unimaginative\\", which made the artwork \\"a waste of visual whimsy\\". Sam Kusek of PopCulture Shock also reviewed An Ideal World positively, grading it as a B+. Kusek applauded the artwork, saying that \\"colors really jump out\\" and set \\"the mood of the scene well, while keeping the backgrounds alive\\", and that character designs enhance \\"the mystical and magical elements of the story\\". Kusek liked the plot, but felt it was predictable; however, he noted that the main element and focus was the \\"philosophy of life\\" and that, overall, An Ideal World \\"flows really well\\". Writing for Comics Worth Reading, Ed Sizemore gave the book a mixed review. Sizemore wrote that he wished the message was conveyed \\"more [subtly]\\" and criticized the beginning of the book as \\"the toughest to get through\\", but felt the \\"pace and readability improve\\" afterwards. He praised the art as \\"gorgeous\\" with \\"lots of eye candy\\" for those who enjoy fantasy artwork. Overall, Sizemore thought An Ideal World was \\"wasted potential\\", with too much emphasis placed on the message, detracting from the storytelling. Publishers Weekly praised An Ideal World for its message and art, but criticized how \\"the book gets bogged down in talky heavy-handedness, as if someone put nice fantasy illustrations into a business self-help book\\". R. Bézard, a French critic for BD Gest, rated the first volume of the Xiao Pan edition of An Ideal World with two out of five stars. Bézard stated that the volume did not draw in the reader or give any indication of A You's future adventure. However, Bézard praised the artwork as expressive and called it a cross between Dragon Ball Z and Fruits Basket.

She was introduced as a supporting character in the original Resident Evil video game in 1996 and became the protagonist of the prequel game Resident Evil Zero in 2002. In the first Resident Evil, Rebecca is a young officer with the fictitious Special Tactics And Rescue Service police unit and is trapped in a zombie-infested mansion. Zero depicts the events before that ordeal, during which she is separated from her team and forced to partner with escaped convict Billy Coen to survive similar circumstances. Both of these stories were revisited and expanded upon in Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles with a scenario set in between. Rebecca appears in several other games and is one of the heroes of the Resident Evil novel series, that includes novelizations of earlier series materials as well as original stories, and of the games' stage play sequel. She is also one of the three protagonists of the animated film Resident Evil: Vendetta, alongside Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield. Appearances Video games Rebecca Chambers makes her first appearance in the original 1996 Resident Evil as a supporting character for Chris Redfield, a fellow officer in the U.S. special police force Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.). She is an 18-year-oldJan Jagodzinski, Youth Fantasies: The Perverse Landscape of the Media (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), p.156. rookie member of the unit's Bravo Team and serves as a field medic additionally in charge of rear security. Before she joined the force, she was a child prodigy and graduated from college at only 18 years old.Resident Evil Zero: BradyGames Official Strategy Guide, page 18 Rebecca arrives at the Arklay Research Facility to investigate a series of cannibalistic murders with her comrades lost and scattered across the Arklay Mountains. Her introduction and other appearances throughout the first game vary depending on the path the player chooses and she can be controlled during portions of the story. She may die an off-screen death as well. Canonically, Rebecca is ultimately rescued by Chris and the Alpha Team and she emerges as Bravo Team's sole survivor of the incident in the canon version of the story. In Resident Evil Zero, a prequel to Resident Evil, Rebecca is one of two protagonists. Shortly after Bravo Team had been dispatched to the Arklay Mountains to investigate the murders, she enters a seemingly abandoned train. Coming under attack by zombies and mutated animals, Rebecca encounters escaped death-row military prisoner Billy Coen and cooperates with him. The two discover that the viral zombie outbreak has been masterminded by James Marcus who had been one of the Umbrella Corporation's top scientists but was assassinated on behalf of the company, only to be revived by the monsters created by him. Rebecca and Billy escape from the train and find themselves in an old underground facility of Umbrella Corporation that was overtaken by Marcus in his lust for revenge. In the end, they manage to destroy both Marcus and the facility. Rebecca allows Billy to escape, falsely reporting his death to the authorities. Rebecca appears in Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles which summarizes the events of Resident Evil Zero and details her later experiences leading up to Resident Evil. The game pairs her with fellow STARS Bravo team member Richard Aiken as they work together to fend off hordes of undead creatures.Damien Waples, \\"Rebecca Chamber's Profile,\\" Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Prima Official Game Guide (Roseville: Prima Games, 2007), p.131. She has survived the events of Resident Evil 2, in which the character makes an easter egg type cameo appearance in an undeveloped film on Wesker's desk. Rebecca is also a playable character in Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition in its minigame mode Mercenaries Reunion, as well as in Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D. Design and gameplay Canadian stage actress Riva Di Paola voiced Rebecca in Resident Evil 0 In the original Resident Evil, Rebecca was portrayed in the game's live-action cut-scenes by an unknown actress simply credited as \\"Linda\\", and voiced by an uncredited Lynn Harris, who also worked as the voice-over director of the game. The game's director Shinji Mikami said in 2014: \\"If I had to name the woman character I most disliked in my games it would be Rebecca Chambers. She’s submissive, she’s not independent. I didn’t want to include her but the staff wanted that kind of character in the game, for whatever reason. I’m sure it made sense to them. And in Japan, that character is pretty popular.\\" For Resident Evil 0, Rebecca's character was modeled after the J-pop star Ayumi Hamasaki, who also served as Capcom's official spokeswoman for the game in Japan.GAF - News - Resident Evil 0 gets a spokesperson While her standard outfit is rather androgynous, Rebecca's alternate costumes in the games \\"expose her midriff and voluptuous shape\\".Gladys L. Knight, Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television (Greenwood, 2010), p.206. In the remake of RE0, Rebecca's face was remodeled and pre-order bonuses included a nurse costume for her. In Zero, where she is a starting character, Rebecca is weaker than Billy and as such can absorb much less damage and cannot push heavier objects. Her unique skill is her ability to mix various chemicals. In the Mercenaries mode of RE5, Rebecca is armed with an MP5 submachine gun, and her melee moves include flame spray, tear gas and taser attacks, but most of them do not instantly kill. To compensate that, she is the only character that starts with two first-aid sprays and extra ammo. In The Mercenaries 3D, Rebecca is an unlockable character with the highest recovery but with the lowest armor (her alternate nurse costume makes her take recover health faster and take even more damage). She carries five healing herbs, an MP5 and a grenade launcher, and her high-damage flame spray attack is replaced by a push out move. Other media Rebecca plays a central role in S. D. Perry's Resident Evil novels written in 1998-2004, namely in the original stories Resident Evil: Caliban Cove and Resident Evil: Underworld, as well as in the novelizations of the games in which she appears (Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy and Resident Evil: Zero Hour). In Caliban Cove, Rebecca, declared outlaw and aided by members of the Exeter, Maine branch of STARS, attempts to stop a rogue scientist from spreading a new strain of the T-virus. In Underworld, Rebecca, Leon S. Kennedy, Claire Redfield, and an original character David Trapp (from Caliban Cove) embark to find the Umbrella Corporation's new facility hidden beneath the desert in the American Southwest, which was taken over by another rogue Umbrella scientist. Rebecca makes a minor appearance in the Resident Evil comic book S.T.A.R.S. Files. In George A. Romero's rejected Resident Evil film screenplay from the late 1990s, Rebecca filled the same role as she did in the first game (in this script, she was one of the four survivors). In the 2015 stage play Biohazard: The Stage, Rebecca (played by Rin Asuka) has become a professor teaching at a university in western Australia. The place becomes a scene of a bio-terrorist incident, which reunites her with Chris Redfield as they once again work together. A computer-animated film starring Rebecca was released in 2017, titled Resident Evil: Vendetta. In the film, Rebecca, long retired as a police officer, now works in university as a professor, using her knowledge of medicine to develop possible cures for viruses. When her laboratory is attacked by bio-terrorists, Rebecca is exposed to the new A-Virus but uses her newly-researched vaccine to save herself. She is rescued by Chris and the BSAA, together enlisting Leon to help them against the surviving members of Los Illuminados (from Resident Evil 4). Rebecca is later captured by Chris' enemy Glenn Arias, who reveals that he desires to marry her because she resembles his late lover, Sara. Eventually, she is saved and cured just in time after being exposed to a stronger strain of his virus. Other appearances In 2001, toymaker Moby Dick produced an action figure of Rebecca in the Resident Evil 3: Nemesis related series even as she does not actually appear in this game (the figure is actually based on the character's depiction in the canceled Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil Zero). A diorama-type figure of Rebecca and the monster Hunter was released by Organic in 2009 and a 1/6 scale resin garage kit of Rebecca in her alternate costume from Zero was released by Vanilla Chop.

According to PlayStation Official Magazine, \\"her starring role in Resident Evil Zero made her a fan favourite.\\" GameDaily featured her as its \\"Babe of the Week\\" as \\"a true American hero\\";Chris Buffa, \\"Babe of the Week: Rebecca Chambers,\\" GameDaily (September 19, 2008). she was included among the 112 most important female characters in games by PC Games Hardware in 2008,Thilo Bayer (Jan 01, 2008), PCGH history: The most important female characters in games, PC Games Hardware. and was ranked as the 93rd best looking game girl by GameHall's Portal PlayGame in 2014. IGN included Rebecca among the characters they would like to return in Resident Evil 6, and Brazilian website Legião dos Heróis proposed a continuation of the story of Rebecca and Billy for a plot of the next Resident Evil CG-animated film by Capcom. Joystiq praised her inclusion in Resident Evil 5s downloadable content, similarly stating \\"we're all for bringing [her] back.\\"David Hinkle, \\"Famitsu: Rebecca Chambers and Barry Burton in RE5: Mercenaries Reunion ,\\" Joystiq (February 9, 2010).

Plot The film centers on the eccentric Mooney family who live in a large house in rural England in the year 1899. The invalid patriarch 'Pa' Mooney (Douglas Phair) is a retired medical doctor who claims to be 180 years old. His eldest daughter, Phoebe (Joan Ogden), more or less cares for him and is head of the household. His eldest son, Mortimer (Noel Collins), is a businessman who conducts the finances of the family and contributes to the family income. Younger daughter Monica (Hope Stansbury) is a sadist who keeps live rats as pets and frequently mutilates them and other small animals. Youngest son Malcolm (Berwick Kaler) is a halfwit with animalistic tendencies; the family keeps him locked in a room with live chickens. The family has a secret: they are all werewolves-natural born werewolves who transform once a month on the night of the full moon. Pa Mooney has been researching for years to find a way to break the family curse. Youngest daughter Diana (Jackie Skarvellis) returns home from medical school in Scotland with a new husband, a former classmate named Gerald (Ian Innes), of whom Pa Mooney heartily disapproves. Pa tells Diana that she is the last hope the family has to overcome the ancient curse, since she is the only member of the family who does not turn into a werewolf on the night of the full moon. Will Diana succeed? Diana is eventually revealed to have other plans, and on top of that, she has her own secret as to why she is \\"different\\" from the other werewolves of the Mooney family.

Some scenes were filmed nearly two years later in Staten Island at the request of producer William Mishkin to pad out the short running time. Because of the film's low budget, Milligan actually acted in at least two different roles during the production under two different names which included playing a gunsmith who sells Diana a pistol containing silver bullets, as well as a pawnshop owner named Mr. Micawber in the re-shot scenes involving Monica and the rats (which were added after Willard achieved popularity).

It was established in 1891 during a visit to the Taras Shevchenko burial grounds near Kaniv. The founders included Vitaliy Borovyk, Borys Hrinchenko, Mykola Mikhnovsky, Ivan Lypa, and others. Beside cultural propaganda Tarasovs were expressing political statements for the liberation of the Ukrainian nation from Russian occupation, full autonomy for all people of the Russian Empire, and social justice. In the small town of Hlynsk near Romny, where the students operated by the end of summer 1891, the program of the Brotherhood was established . Among them were: *Independent sovereign Ukraine: united and undivided from San to Kuban, from the Carpathian mountains to the Caucasus mountains free among the free, equal among the equal, and without a class stand-off in future. *Federation of Left-bank, Right-bank, Steppe Ukraine, Kuban and Galicia. *The head of state is hetman as the president and seym as parliament. *Freedom of religion, division between church and state, national army. *We won't be ourselves, if for Ukraine there is no freedom nor fate. The ideological fundamentals of the organization were prepared by Ivan Lypa and were published in Pravda magazine in April 1893. Those ideas were later propagated by B.Hrinchenko in his Letters from the Dnieper Ukraine and Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky in his fairy tale Kho. In summer 1893 some of the members of the society were arrested in Kharkiv, but further centers reappeared in Kiev, Odessa, Poltava to name just a few. Among other participants the members of the Brotherhood were Volodymyr Samiylenko, Vasyl Sovachiv, Yevhen Tymchenko, Oleksandr Cherniakhivsky, Volodymyr Shemet. The organization was discontinued in 1898, but under its influence another organization, Stara Hromada reestablished itself as the General Ukrainian Organization in 1897 under the initiative of Oleksandr Konysky and Volodymyr Antonovych, while the younger generation of the Hromada created the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party in 1900.

As in several of the author's poems (she was known for \\"saccharine imitations of Jacobite song\\") its theme is the aftermath of the Jacobite Rising of 1745, which ended at the Battle of Culloden. Written well after the events it commemorates, it is not a genuine Jacobite song, like many other songs that were \\"composed in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but ... passed off as contemporary products of the Jacobite risings.\\" Lady Nairne came from a Jacobite family, and Prince Charles had stopped to dine at Nairne House on 4 September 1745, during the march to Edinburgh. Her father was exiled the year after, but the family \\"hoarded\\" a number of objects \\"supposedly given to him by Prince Charles.\\" The song, especially its melody, is widely and traditionally used as a song of farewell – often in association with Auld Lang Syne, and generally with no particular Jacobite or other political intent. Theme The \\"Bonnie Charlie\\" of the song is \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" or the Young Pretender, the last serious Stuart claimant to the British throne. After Culloden, he escaped to the continent with the help of Flora MacDonald, and other loyal followers. The song expresses joy in Bonnie Charlie's escape from capture and possible execution, and celebrates the loyalty of his followers and their longing for his return. The song has been described as evoking a type of nostalgic idealism: \\"Who that hears \\"Bonnie Charlie\\" sung...but is touched by that longing for the unattainable which is the blessing and the despair of the idealist?\\" Use The song has long been a \\"time honored Scottish farewell.\\" In this function, it is generally sung (like Auld Lang Syne) as a \\"first verse and chorus\\". Also like Auld Lang Syne, the song has acquired a more general use: it was sung by Canadians, for instance, in honour of George VI in 1939; by Australians as a farewell to then-Princess Elizabeth in 1946; and by Elizabeth II's \\"Scottish subjects\\" in 1953. It was sung by an Australian choir to the departing athletes at the closing ceremonies of the Melbourne Summer Olympic Games in 1956, as seen in the 'Olympiad' documentary series by Bud Greenspan. American golfer, Bobby Jones, was serenaded out of St Andrews' Younger Hall to the tune, after being made an honorary freeman of the Borough of St Andrews, Scotland in October 1958. With the rise of the Scottish nationalist movement it has become common to sing several verses of the song, especially the strongly \\"Jacobite\\" ones, apparently as an expression of desire for Scottish independence. Musical adaptations Different adaptations exist, in SATB and TTBB. It was used as a theme in improvisations by organist Alexandre Guilmant and in a piano composition by James MacMillan. Lyrics Different versions of the lyrics exist. These words seem to be Lady Nairne's own: they are taken from an 1869 edition of her songs, which cites five stanzas (alternating with the \\"Will ye no' come back again\\" chorus), of which the middle three are explicitly Jacobite.

Story The story of Denikeri takes place in the summer of a fictional city named Tenshin set in the modern time. Yuto Kamiki was originally going to a regular school until it was absorbed by a famous female school named . The shrine that Yuto is from, the Kamiki shrine, has always been tasked with the duty of watching over a battle that determines the successor of the Tenjo family, the reigning family of the Tenshin city region. In this ceremony, Rio Tenjo and Kikyou Tenjo have to battle each other with swords. A fateful event occurs at the ceremony and Yuto ends up living with Rio. Development Denikeri is Windmill's eleventh game after Shukufuku no Campanella and its life began around February and March 2009 at an internal staff meeting over what Windmill's next project should be. At the meeting, there were a lot of people that wanted to create a game that was set in a school. Coincidentally, after the release of Shukufuku no Campanella, the Windmill staff received several requests from players that also wanted a game that was set in a school setting. With the fans' requests matching the staff's own desires, designing and planning for a new project began in earnest. From there, the staff began removing elements such as \\"magic\\" and \\"supernatural powers\\" and then proceeded ahead with creating a story that could potentially happen in the real world. The producer of Denikeri is Chatora. The scenarios of Denikeri is being written by Tahei Hirauchi who have previously worked on Prism Ark Love Love Maximum. The music of Denikeri is being composed by Ecnemuse. The art and character designs for Denikeri will be provided by Kōcha and Yū Narumi. This will be the first time that Narumi will be doing the art and character designs for a Windmill game. Kōcha provided character designs for Kikyou Tenjo, Misono Misono, and Haruka Tomone while Narumi provided designs for Rio Tenjo, Komachi Suzueda, and Yuzuna Kaede. With regards to the character designs, both Kōcha and Narumi stated that they were pretty much free to design them however they pleased. Release history The limited edition of Denikeri was released on April 29, 2010. The limited edition of the game came with a collection of illustrations and original sketches, a CD of background music tracks, and a promotional Lycee Windmill 3.0 card. A reservation campaign for Denikeri began on January 29, 2010 and took place until April 28, 2010, one day before the release of the limited edition. Those who reserve the game will receive a maxi single containing the game's theme song. Music The opening theme, , is performed by Rekka Katakiri. The lyrics was written by Ayachi and the music and arrangement was done by Daisuke Kikuta of Element Gardens.

It connects the Munich–Rosenheim and the Rosenheim–Salzburg lines at Rosenheim with the line to Innsbruck, thus connecting Germany, Salzburg and eastern Austria with Innsbruck and the Brenner line to Italy and the Arlberg line to far western Austria. The line is part of the Line 1 of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). It is electrified at 15 kV, 16.7 Hz. History A treaty between Austria and Bavaria, signed on 21 June 1851, regulated the access of each state to the other in relation to the building of railways. As there was no direct rail link between Vienna and the Tyrol at that time, Bavaria agreed in Article 1 that it would build railways from Munich to the border at Salzburg and from Rosenheim to the border at Kufstein. Austria committed itself under Article 2 to build a railway from Salzburg to Bruck an der Mur and from Kufstein to Innsbruck. The line was opened on 5 August 1858 as part of the Bavarian Maximilian’s Railway. Route The line runs from Rosenheim in a southerly direction. After leaving Rosenheim station, it joins the southern end of the Rosenheim loop (or Rosenheim curve). The curve was opened on the 8 February 1982 and connects the line with the line from Salzburg, bypassing the station. The line also connects in Rosenheim station with the line from Mühldorf and the Mangfall Valley line from Holzkirchen. To the south, the line passes through the Inn valley. A standard gauge line once ran from Raubling station to a peat works at Nicklheim. The narrow gauge Wendelstein Railway ran from Brannenburg station until 1961 when it was cut back to Waching in order to avoid several level crossings. Another narrow gauge line, the Wachtl Railway, still connects the cement plant near Kiefersfelden station with limestone quarries at Wachtl, just inside Austria in the municipality of Thiersee. Since 1991 a tourist service, called the Wachtl Express, has operated on the line from time to time. Between Kiefersfelden and Kufstein, the line crosses the border into Austria; the border station serves Kufstein. After Kufstein, the line becomes the Lower Inn Valley railway and leads on to Innsbruck. Operations Signpost at the Austrian border The route is part of the northern access to the Brenner railway to Italy and is thus part of the Berlin–Palermo railway axis. Non-stop travel time between Rosenheim and the border at Kufstein is 15 minutes, but due to temporary speed restrictions in most cases trains take longer. There is an hourly regional train service to Innsbruck, which requires a change in Kufstein. Every two hours, a EuroCity (EC) train operates on the route through Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass to Italy. Every two hours, Austrian Federal Railways runs Vienna–Salzburg–Innsbruck–Vorarlberg express trains over the line from South Rosenheim to Kufstein, but they do not stop. Although there are additional passenger services, there is still no regular-interval hourly service between Salzburg and Innsbruck. Currently, there are 32 scheduled services passenger services each day on the line. In addition approximately 20 freight trains operate each working day.  Development The construction of additional tracks to create a four-track line on the Rosenheim–Kufstein section is considered from time to time to cope with the expected increase in traffic after the opening of the Brenner Base Tunnel. Further expansion plans would provide a bypass of Rosenheim, with a branch off the line from Munich at Großkarolinenfeld and connecting with the Rosenheim–Kufstein line at Brannenburg. Currently, only small projects are underway. These include the elimination of level crossings (most recently at Flintsbach and Brannenburg) and the installation of noise barriers, particularly in towns in the Inn Valley.

The field is a long narrow band paralleling the Santa Clara River near the town of Saticoy. Discovered in 1955, it is one of the smaller but productive fields found in the region after most of the large fields had already been operational for decades. At the beginning of 2009 it still contained an estimated of recoverable oil out of its original 23.5 million, and had 15 wells remaining in operation. Vintage Production, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, was the primary operator on the field as of 2009. p. 101, 166 Geographic setting Active oil well within a working agricultural field near Saticoy. The riparian vegetation in the background is the Santa Clara River. The field is long and narrow, exactly following the Oak Ridge Fault which also defines the alignment of the Santa Clara River, running from northeast to southwest. The field is approximately four miles long by one-quarter mile across, amounting to 640 productive acres total, mostly on the northwest side of the Santa Clara River.DOGGR, p. 488-490 California State Route 126 parallels the field for its entire length, about one-half mile to the northwest. The large South Mountain Oil Field is adjacent on the northeast, and the Santa Clara Avenue and Oxnard oil fields are south of the river, on the north and south sides of U.S. Highway 101 respectively. Land use in the vicinity of the field is predominantly agricultural, with oil wells and associated production infrastructure interspersed between working agricultural fields and orchards. Climate in the region is Mediterranean, with cool, rainy winters and warm, rainless summers, in which the heat is moderated by frequent morning coastal low clouds and fog. Annual precipitation is around 15 inches, almost all in the winter, and all in the form of rain. The mean annual temperature is to ; freezes occur rarely. Elevations on the field range from about above sea level. As it is in the Santa Clara River floodplain it is mostly flat, with runoff going directly into the adjacent Santa Clara River which flows west toward its outlet into the Pacific Ocean between Oxnard and Ventura. Geology Detail of the Saticoy field, showing its location relative to Ventura, Oxnard, and other urbanized areas. Yellow dots represent locations of active oil wells as of 2008. The Saticoy field is within the Ventura Basin Province of southern California. Geologically, this area is part of a structural downwarp that occurred during the late Pliocene. Within the Ventura Basin are some of the richest agricultural fields in California, made possible by the thick alluvial topsoil left by tens of thousands of years of floods from the area's river systems. The basin is filled with sedimentary layers, and cut through from northeast to southwest by the Oak Ridge Fault. In the Saticoy field, oil is trapped both in pinchouts of updipping permeable sedimentary units within units of lesser permeability, and in sedimentary units which end abruptly at the Oak Ridge Thrust Fault; oil migrating upwards within permeable units, in this case, encounters an impermeable barrier of rock placed there by the fault. Horizontally, the fault defines the course of the Santa Clara River and the northern base of the hills south of the river (including South Mountain), and is part of the fault complex responsible for the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The fault bounds the field on the southeast; many of the oil-bearing units have been deformed so as to be aligned almost vertically, especially in the lower zones.DOGGR, p. 488 The sedimentary units are predominantly turbidites, and are of Pleistocene and Pliocene age.Gary W. Blackie, Robert S. Yeats. \\"Magnetic-Reversal Stratigraphy of Pliocene- Pleistocene Producing Section of Saticoy Oil Field, Ventura Basin, California\\". AAPG Bulletin, Vol. 60, 1976.

API gravity varies from 30 to 36. The shallowest producing formation, the Upper F Zone, has an average depth of below ground surface, and the deepest, the K, has an average depth of .DOGGR, p. 488-500 History, production and operations Shell Oil Co. drilled the discovery well for the field in May 1955, reaching a depth of 12,020 feet. Development of the Saticoy field was unusual in that the deepest producing horizons, the J and K, were the first to be discovered. All of the rest – F, G, H, and I – had been found by Shell by August 1956, and development of the field was quick after that. The field reached peak production in 1958 at of oil per year.DOGGR, p. 488-480 As production began its inevitable decline, Shell commenced waterflooding operations to increase reservoir pressure and dispose of produced water. Waterflooding ran from 1963 to 1968 in the G, H, I, and J zones. Shell held most of the field until 1984, at which time they sold it to Sage Energy. This was a period during which many of the major oil companies were divesting their operations in the onshore coastal portions of California, selling them to smaller independent operators, in order to focus on more profitable opportunities overseas. Sage held the field until 1990, at which time they sold it to Whiting Petroleum Corp; Whiting sold some active wells to Crimson Resource Management Corp. in 1994. Crimson ran the field until 2002, at which time they sold their 41 remaining wells to Bentley-Simonson, who held it until April 2005, selling to Plains Exploration & Production, who operated the declining field for slightly more than a year, selling the 14 remaining active wells to their present operator, Vintage Production, in October 2006.abandoned well record, with details of transfers of groups of wellsactive well record, with details of transactions of groups of wells from drilling to present day As of 2010, there were 15 wells remaining on the field, 14 active and operated by Vintage.

This was the last contact with the aircraft and no trace of the plane or 7-man crew was ever found. *16 February 1967, Jolly Green 56 took off to rescue the pilot of Dusty 71 an F-100 shot down over Laos. The helicopter received ground fire and the pilot Captain Angelo Pullara, was hit and killed. The helicopter returned safely to Saravane, Laos. The Dusty 71 pilot was rescued by Jolly Green 37. *5 May 1967, 6 civilian men and a 6-year-old boy were rescued by an amphibious aircraft piloted by Colonel Alan R. Vette, the squadron's commanding officer. The yachtsmen's sailing schooner, Dante Deo, was wrecked on Bombay Reef in the Paracel Islands, about offshore, due east of the squadron's Danang base. *27 October 1967, Jolly Green 20, HH-3E Tail No 66-13283 was on a combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission over Laos when it was hit in the engine by ground fire while hovering. Aircraft was destroyed by bombing. Survivors and ground party rescued by Jolly Green 07. *9 November 1967, Jolly Green 26, HH-3E Tail No 66-13279 and Jolly Green 29 were scrambled to extract the five surviving members of a Special Forces reconnaissance team that had suffered heavy casualties in Laos. JG29 successfully extracted 3 indigenous team members before being hit by ground fire, it departed and made an emergency landing at Khe Sanh Combat Base. JG26 extracted Special Forces Specialist Four Joseph G. Kusick and Master Sergeant Bruce R. Baxter, both wounded, but JG26 was then hit by ground fire, crashed and burst into flames. A recovery team was inserted into the area and reached the crash site, but due to fading light, it was impossible to inspect the wreckage at that time. On the morning of 10 November, the pilot Captain Gerald O. Young was rescued after evading capture for some 17 hours after the crash. Later that morning the wreckage was searched and the charred remains of Kusick were recovered. The copilot Captain Ralph Brower, the flight engineer Staff Sergeant Eugene L Clay, the pararescueman Sergeant Larry W. Maysey and Master Sergeant Bruce Baxter were all killed in action-body not recovered. Captain Gerald Young was awarded the Medal of Honor. *28 February 1968, The ARRS made their 1,000 combat save since 1964 when Jolly Green 36 rescued Captain Gene I. Basel, 354th Tactical Fight Squadron pilot flying an Republic F-105D, Bu No 62-4385. When ejection handles failed to engage, the pilot was catapulted to the ground when his aircraft exploded. Pararescue Specialist Joseph M. Duffy went down on the hoist to extract pilot who had sustained two broken thigh bones. At the time of the rescue the Basel's parachute was entangled in branches and there was ground fire approaching his location. The rescue was accomplished in two hours.355 TFW History – August 67 – Feb 68-1-1 *9 June 1968, Jolly Green 23 HH-3E Tail No 67-14710 was on CSAR for First Lieutenant Walter R. Schmidt pilot of Hellborne 215, a USMC A-4C shot down over the A Shau Valley. Voice contact was established with Schmidt, who reported he possibly had a broken arm and leg. Several attempts at pickup were made by the lead helicopter, Jolly Green 22, but it was driven off by intense ground fire. After suppressive fire was put in, JG23 moved in to attempt the pickup, JG23 reported taking hits and then caught fire. The pilot attempted to land in a small clearing, but the helicopter exploded when it hit the ground and burned intensely. There were no indications anyone survived the crash. Pilot Lieutenant Jack Columbus Rittichier, co-pilot Captain Richard C. Yeend, flight engineer Staff Sergeant Elmer L. Holden and pararescueman James D. Locker were all killed in action- body not recovered. The remains of the crew were returned and identified in September 2003. First Lieutenant Schmidt remains missing in action presumed dead. *5 October 1968, Jolly Green 10, HH-3E Tail No 65-12782 and another Jolly Green were scrambled to extract a Special Forces reconnaissance team callsign Carrot Top in Laos. The first JG went in under heavy ground fire, received damage to its fuel lines and had to abort the mission and return to the base. JG10 was shot down about 500 m from the pickup point. The pararescueman was able to pull the pilot from the burning helicopter, but before he could return JG10 exploded, killing the copilot Albert D. Wester and the flight engineer Gregory P. Lawrence, who were trapped inside. Another Jolly Green was sent out to rescue the Special Forces team and the 2 survivors from JG10. *24 October 1969, Jolly Green 28 HH-3E tail No 66-13281 dropped pararescueman Technical Sergeant Donald G Smith to rescue the pilot of F-100 Misty 11A over Laos. As Smith and the pilot were being raised, hostile fire rendered the hoist inoperative and the cable was sheared, dropping them fifteen feet to the ground. Smith's position was surrounded by hostile forces and JG28 was downed by hostile fire. Smith controlled and directed the aircraft providing suppressive fire, resulting in the safe recovery of all downed personnel, and he was awarded the Air Force Cross for his actions *15 April 1970, Jolly Green 27, HH-3E Tail No 66-13280 and another Jolly Green were scrambled to rescue the survivors of a downed UH-1 near Dak Seang Camp, Kontum Province, Vietnam. JG27 made three rescue attempts, but was brought down by ground fire. The pilot Captain Travis H Scott was killed on impact. The copilot, Major Wofford, dragged the other two crewmen from the burning aircraft. The second HH-3 evacuated the survivors of the first HH-3 but was unable to rescue personnel in the downed UH-1. The flight engineer Technical Sergeant Gerald L. Hartzel and pararescueman Staff Sergeant Luther E Davis later died from their injuries. Major Wofford was awarded the Air Force Cross, and Captain Scott was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross. *21 November 1970, Banana 01, HH-3E Tail No 68-12785 was deliberately crashed in the Son Tay POW Camp as part of Operation Ivory Coast. *25 November 1971, Jolly Green 70, HH-53C Tail No 68-10366 crashed into the Song Na River, Gia Dinh, South Vietnam while on a CSAR mission. All 4 crewmen were killed. *3 April 1972, Jolly Greens of the squadron made two attempts to pick up Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton Bat 21 Bravo near Quảng Trị, South Vietnam, both times, they were driven off with heavy damage to their aircraft. On 6 April Jolly Green 67 HH-53C Tail No 68-10365 was designated to make the rescue attempt, but as it came to a hover over Hambleton, it was raked by heavy fire. JG67 aborted the rescue attempt and tried to maneuver to safety, but the enemy fire continued and JG67 crashed in a huge fireball a few km south of the pickup point. The fire was intense and lasted several days. All 6 crewmembers were killed. The remains of the crew were returned in June 1994 and were buried as a group at Arlington National Cemetery in November 1997. *1 May 1972, Jolly Greens of the squadron evacuated 132 US advisers from Quảng Trị as the city was falling to the PAVN Easter Offensive *18 August 1972, HH-53C Tail No 68-10361 was destroyed on the ramp at Danang by a Vietcong 122mm rocket.

Operation Titstorm was the name given to the cyber attacks by the perpetrators. They resulted in lapses of access to government websites on 10 and 11 February 2010. This was accompanied by emails, faxes, and phone calls harassing government offices. The actual size of the attack and number of perpetrators involved is unknown but it was estimated that the number of systems involved ranged from the hundreds to the thousands. The amount of traffic caused disruption on multiple government websites. Australian Telecommunications Minister Stephen Conroy proposed the regulations that would mainly filter sites with pornographic content. Various groups advocating uncensored access to the Internet, along with companies like Google and Yahoo!, object to the proposed filter. A spokesperson for Conroy said that the actions were not a legitimate form of protest and called it irresponsible. The attacks also drew criticism from other filter protest groups. The initial stage was followed by small in-person protests on 20 February that were called \\"Project Freeweb\\". Background Stephen Conroy The attack began as a protest responding to a plan by Australian Telecommunications Minister Stephen Conroy that would require internet service providers to block Australian users from accessing illegal and what the government deemed as \\"unwanted\\" content. Websites to be blocked feature pornography showing rape, bestiality, child sex abuse, small- breasted women (who may appear under the legal age), and female ejaculation. Drawn depictions of such acts are included in the proposal. The proposed filter also includes gambling sites along with others showing drug use. A leaked version of the proposed blacklist (also referred to as the \\"refused classification\\" or \\"RC\\" list) also showed sites that did not include adult content. The name \\"Operation Titstorm\\" was in reference to the material that would be censored. Google has questioned the proposal, saying the prohibitions would be too broad. It is strongly opposed by free speech groups. A poll conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research for the Hungry Beast television program found that 80% of their 1,000 respondents were in favour of the concept of the plan. The survey also found that 91% were concerned about the government's intent to keep the list of filtered websites a secret. The Department of Defence's Cyber Security Operations Centre discovered the attack was coming on 5 February. A statement released by Anonymous to the press two days before the attack said, \\"No government should have the right to refuse its citizens access to information solely because they perceive it to be 'unwanted'.\\" It went on to read, \\"The Australian Government will learn that one does not mess with our porn. No one messes with our access to perfectly legal (or illegal) content for any reason\\". Anonymous had previously garnered media attention with protests against Church of Scientology (Project Chanology) and the Iranian government. In September 2009, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's website was hacked in a similar protest to proposed web censorship reforms. Attacks Flyers distributed to recruit participants said the attack was to begin at 8 pm AEST on 10 February. On that day, government websites were targeted by denial-of-service attacks. The Communications Department said the hackers had not infiltrated government security, but had instead swamped government computer servers. Sites were left unavailable for sporadic periods throughout the attack. At one point, the Australian Parliament's website was offline for about two days due to the high volume of requests. Rudd's government site was also inaccessible for some time. As a primary target, the Communications Department also received a large amount of traffic. Government offices were also flooded with e-mail spam, junk faxes, and prank phone calls. The Prime Minister's homepage was vandalized with pornographic images. The flyer released before the attack called for the faxes to focus on cartoon pornography, female ejaculation, and small-breasted pornography. Reports of the actual size of the attack have varied. One cyber security expert described the attacks as \\"the equivalent of parking a truck across the driveway of a shopping centre\\". A firm marketing security technology said that the peak of the attack was a relatively low 16.84 megabits per second. One writer described the 7.5 million requests per second that initially brought down the Parliament website as \\"massive\\". The site usually only receives a few hundred per second. It appears that botnets made up of compromised computers were not used. Estimates of the number of attacking systems involved have ranged from hundreds to thousands. Response A spokeswoman for Conroy said such attacks were not a legitimate political protest. According to her, they were \\"totally irresponsible and potentially deny services to the Australian public\\". The Systems Administrators Guild of Australia said that it \\"condemned DDoS attacks as the wrong way to express disagreement with the proposed law\\". Anti- censorship groups criticised the attacks, saying they hurt their cause. A purported spokesperson for the attackers recommended that the wider Australian public protest the filter by signing the petition of Electronic Frontiers Australia. Anonymous coordinated a second phase with small protests outside the Parliament House in Canberra and in major cities throughout Australia on 20 February. Additional demonstrations were held at some of the country's embassies overseas. The organizers called the follow-up protests \\"Project Freeweb\\" to differentiate them from the criticised cyber attacks. Several supporters of the attack later said on a messageboard that taking down websites was not enough to convince the government to back down on the web filtering policy and called for violence. Others disagreed with such actions and proposed launching an additional attack on a popular government site. A spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia said he believed there was no real intention or capacity to follow through with any of the violent threats. The attack also resulted in criticism of Australia's terrorism laws from The University of New South Wales Law Journal. One writer wrote that the provisions leave \\"no place for legitimate acts of online protest, or at least sets the penalty far too high for relatively minor cyber-vandalism\\". An Australian teenager was charged with four counts of inciting other hackers to impair electronic communications and two of unauthorised access to restricted data for his role in the attack. He was ordered to pay a bond instead of being convicted after pleading guilty and showing good behaviour. In July 2010, Conroy delayed implementing the plan pending a 12-month review into how refused classification content was rated. The proposal is not expected to go forward due to the opposition from The Coalition and the Greens. Internet service providers Telstra and Optus have both agreed to voluntarily block some content.

La Casa de Pilatos (Pilate's House) is an Andalusian palace in Seville, Spain, which serves as the permanent residence of the Dukes of Medinaceli. It is an example of an Italian Renaissance building with Mudéjar elements and decorations. It is considered the prototype of the Andalusian palace. The Casa de Pilatos has around 150 different 1530s azulejo (Spanish glazed tile) designs made by the brothers Diego and Juan Pulido, one of the largest azulejo collections in the world. History Main gate. The construction of this palace, which is adorned with precious azulejo tiles and well-kept gardens, was begun in 1483 by Pedro Enríquez de Quiñones, Adelantado Mayor of Andalucía, and his wife Catalina de Rivera, founder of the Casa de Alcalá, and completed by Pedro's son Fadrique Enríquez de Rivera (first Marquis of Tarifa), whose pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1519 led to the building being given the name \\"Pilate's House\\". On 20 October 1520, Don Fadrique returned from a trip through Europe and the Holy Land. During Lent in 1521, he inaugurated the observance in Seville of the Holy Via Crucis (Holy Way of the Cross). The route began in the Chapel of the Flagellations of his palace and ended at a pillar located not far from the Templete, or Cruz del Campo (The Cross of the Field,) located outside the city walls. This route ran the same distance of 1321 paces supposed to have separated the praetorium of Pontius Pilate from Calvary. The Marquis's palace, the Palacio de San Andrés, was then still partly under construction; it later became known as the Casa de Pilatos through its association with the Vía Crucis, and was much altered over the next few centuries. Popular imagination has since mistakenly identified the palace as a copy of the house of Pilate; thus the rooms have been named along the theme of the Passion of Christ: \\"Hall of the Praetorian\\", \\"Chapel of the Flagellations\\", etc. It was declared a National Monument in 1931. The oldest documentation of the name Casa de Pilatos is from 1754. Old azulejos through the palace In the 16th century, under the orders of the viceroy of Naples, the architect Benvenuto Tortello was responsible for rebuilding the palace leaving the old Mudéjar rooms intact. Floor plan The two 16th- century tiled gardens made by Neapolitan Benvenuto Tortello; both gardens suffered renovations in 19th century. The palace is accessed through a Renaissance-style marble gate, designed by the Genoese Antonio Maria Aprile in 1529, and surmounted by a Gothic crest, possibly brought from the palace that developers were building in Bornos. The gate leads to a typical Andalusian courtyard with a fountain, and surrounded by twenty-four busts of Spanish kings, Roman emperors and other relevant characters collected from the ruins of the Roman colony of Italica distributed along the lower galleries of the courtyard. The courtyard, in turn, leads to two gardens with plateresque adornments. A staircase to the top floor is decorated with azulejo tiling and a ceiling of Mudéjar honeycomb, made by Cristobal Sanchez. The rooms on this floor include major paintings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, including the Pietà by Sebastiano del Piombo. In the room to the left wing of the Tower the ceiling displays frescoes painted by Francisco Pacheco between 1603 and 1604 showing the apotheosis of Hercules, and in the room that follows the Tower is a small painting by Francisco Goya of a bullfight, then a still life by Giuseppe Recco in the dining room and a table representing Mary Magdalene painted in the sixteenth century; in the library are three works by painter Luca Giordano. As with most palaces of the period, the Casa de Pilatos also has a chapel, designed in a fusion of the Gothic and Mudéjar styles, with antique decor and numerous manuscripts. The Casa de Pilatos is considered one of the finest examples of Andalusian architecture of 16th-century Seville. The house is open to the public year-round.  Film location  Several films have been shot in the Casa de Pilatos, including four Hollywood blockbusters: Lawrence of Arabia in 1962, and Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise in 1992, and Kingdom of Heaven in 2005. At the end of 2009, Tom Cruise filmed the movie Knight and Day with Cameron Diaz at the palace.

It is native to many high latitude areas in the northern and southern hemispheres including Alaska, Canada, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, England, Scotland, Norway, Finland, the Kola Peninsula, Russia, Patagonia, South Africa and Australia. Life cycle A study examined the life cycle of the tick in colonies of king penguin and macaroni penguin. It was found that on the king penguin, the cycle took three years and the period for engorgement was limited to 3.5–4.5 months each year even though penguins occupied the site throughout the year. The ticks nearly all overwintered in the unengorged state. In contrast, the cycle took two years in the macaroni penguin in consequence of the rather different timetable of occupation of the colony for breeding and moulting in this species. A study in an Adelie penguin colony found that the tick had alternate periods of feeding and off-host aggregation under rocks. The engorged ticks found an aggregation site with the help of a pheromone released by other ticks. Guanine, the major excretory product of ticks, encouraged assembly. Non-fed stages responded positively to guano and uric acid, excretory products of the penguins, suggesting that these act as a kairomone to help them locate their host. After feeding, the immature ticks’ response to both the assembly and kairomones ceased for a few days until after they had moulted. Vector Ixodes uriae has been shown to be a vector of Borrelia garinii, a species of spirochaete that causes Lyme disease in humans. However, in order for the bacterium to infect man, another species of tick would have to be involved, Ixodes scapularis which is found on deer. Cross infection between seabirds and deer is uncommon because they do not share the same habitat so the risk to human health of infected Ixodes uriae is minimal. In 1975, the Nugget virus (Kemerovo or Great Island virus serogroup) and Taggert virus (Sakhalin serogroup) were isolated from Ixodes uriae from Macquarie Island. Seabird tick carved on pare on display at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection at Landcare Research, Auckland In association with Macquarie Island penguins the tick was shown in 2009 to harbor five arboviruses: Gadgets Gully virus and Precarious Point virus, both previously described, and the previously unknown Sandy Bay virus (an orbivirus), Catch-me-cave virus (a phlebovirus), and Finch Creek virus (a nairovirus).

During the dot com bubble, the company had a market capitalization of over $50 billion. The company was originally known as Internet Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Actua Corporation in September 2014. In 2018, the company underwent liquidation. History  Incubator  In March 1996, Ken Fox and Walter Buckley left Safeguard Scientifics to form Internet Capital Group (ICG), a venture capital firm focused on business-to-business e-commerce. They asked Safeguard Scientifics CEO Pete Musser for $5 million in funding, but he insisted on investing $15 million. In total, Buckley and Fox raised $40 million to start ICG, twice what they wanted. In addition to Safeguard Scientifics, major investors included Comcast, Compaq, BancBoston Ventures, and a dozen individuals. Initially, the company was organized as a limited-liability company. Following the \\"keiretsu\\" model used by Safeguard Scientifics, the company was heavily involved in the operations of the companies in which it invested and the start-ups would do business with each other, increasing the value of all parties. Its annual meetings were opportunities for CEOs of partner companies to share their experiences and cut new deals. One member CEO called it \\"a perfect way to manage chaos.\\" The work environment was casual, or as one partner company CEO called it, \\"almost like a fraternity\\". One of ICG's first investments was a website called Water Online. Under the guidance of ICG, in late 1997, Water Online hired Mark Walsh, head of AOL's B2B division, as CEO. The company changed its name to VerticalNet, expanded into 47 different industries, and became one of the first B2B companies to become a public company, albeit with limited revenue. Spurning opportunities to invest in online retailers such as CDNow and AutoWeb, ICG developed a reputation as \\"the VCs to see if you were an entrepreneur with a B2B idea.\\" In July 1998, GE Capital invested in the company in a financing round that generated $70 million. Early investments began to pay off and ICG generated additional funds by selling some of its positions. However, unlike traditional venture capitalists, Buckley and Fox envisioned that ICG would hold most of its investments for ten years or longer. The duo were ambitious, aiming to have a stake in 80% of the B2B market. In the fall of 1998, to support this goal, the company aggressively hired top talent from companies such as Microsoft, McKinsey & Co., General Electric, Cambridge Technology Partners, Heidrick & Struggles, and Softbank. After much effort, Fox persuaded Sam Jadallah, Microsoft's chief of enterprise sales and marketing, to join the company. In February 1999, the company converted to a C corporation. In May, $90 million of additional funding was raised via a convertible bond issue.  Public Company  In August 1999, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, offering 14.9 million shares at $12 per share. The company sold another 7.5 million shares to IBM, generating more than $200 million. Dell Computer bought 1 million of the shares in the IPO. High-profile investors now included Amerindo Investment Advisors, the House of Saud, the Penske family, and David Bonderman. Safeguard Scientifics was the largest stakeholder. At the time of the IPO, ICG held stakes in 35 companies. About half the businesses aimed to create either an online marketplace or online community, while the other half were engaged in software development. The stock doubled in price on its first day, and hit $50 per share in October 1999. Book value of the company, including stakes in VerticalNet and U.S. Interactive which had gone public, was only about $1 billion and Wall Street was betting on future success. By December 1999, the stock was trading at over $200 per share. Buckley's stake of 10 million shares, or 3.5% of the company and Fox's stake of 12 million shares, or 4.5% of the company, were each worth over $2 billion. The company was valued at nearly $60 billion, making it the 3rd largest Internet company by market capitalization behind AOL and Yahoo!. By then, the company had invested $300 million in 39 start-ups and had a staff of 29 people to manage and advise those companies. Operations were split into two locations with Buckley serving as CEO and working out of the Philadelphia area, while Fox managed West Coast operations in San Francisco. Three executives were hired in November to head a new European team. In December 1999, the company raised over $1 billion in additional capital. During its first 9 months as a corporation, it realized only $14.8 million of revenue and lost $6.4 million. In 1998, it recorded a profit of $14 million on $3 million of revenue, with the profits coming from sales of companies. By February 1, 2000, the stock had declined nearly $100 per share in anticipation of insider selling at the expiration of the lock-up period. However, retail investors bought up insider shares, stabilizing the price. Meanwhile, the company continued to expand its investments. By early 2000, the company had invested $1.4 billion in 61 start-up firms, and was forging new partnerships with old economy leaders. The rapid expansion was motivated by what Fox called \\"the biggest wealth-creation opportunity the world has ever seen\\" – finding the promising e-commerce B2B companies before anyone else. The NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked in March 2000 and the company was hurt by the bursting of the dot-com bubble. By April 2000, its stock was down to $40 a share and GE Capital filed to sell nearly 1 million shares. By June 2000, the stock was down to $30 per share. Buckley, who sold very little of his own stock, remained optimistic. By November 2000, the stock was down to $11 per share and after the September 11 attacks it traded for 70 cents per share. Two years after its peak in March 2000, the company had a market capitalization of $200 million, down 99.5%. The company survived the crash, and changed its business model. Instead of taking small stakes in many companies, it invested in a few \\"core\\" companies at a time, usually as majority owner. This allowed the company to have much greater control over the operations of its investments. Buckley refocused the company to find strategic partnerships with traditional industry leaders such as a joint venture with DuPont called CapSpan in early 2000. ICG sold Logistics.com to Manhattan Associates for $20 million in 2003.  Winding down  In February 2013, the company sold its stake in Channel Intelligence to Google for $60 million in proceeds. By December, the company sold Procurian to Accenture for $375 million. In September 2014, when the company changed its name to Actua Corporation, its stock was trading around $20 per share and was worth approximately $700 million. In October 2016, the company sold Govdelivery to Vista Equity Partners for $153 million. December of the following year, the company sold its interests in VelocityEHS and Bolt Solutions for $328 million. In January 2018, the company sold FolioDynamix for net proceeds of $166.3 million. That same year, the company underwent liquidation.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as the drop in platelet count from the normal range of 150,000 –400,000 / μL to a count lower than 150,000 / μL.Perepu U, Rosenstein L. Maternal thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Proc Obstet Gynecol. 2013;3(1): Article 6 [15 p.]. Available from: http://ir.uiowa.edu/pog/. Free full text article There is still ongoing research to determine the reason for the lowering of platelet count in women with a normal pregnancy. Some researchers speculate the cause to be dependent on dilution, decreased production of platelets, or an increased turnover event.Mccrae, Keith R. \\"Thrombocytopenia in Pregnancy.\\" Platelets (2013): 909-28. Web Although women with normal pregnancy experience a low platelet count, women experiencing a continuous drop in platelet will be diagnosed with thrombocytopenia and women with levels greater than 70,000 / μL will be diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia affects approximately 7-10% of pregnant women and of the 7-10%, within that population; approximately 70-80% have gestational thrombocytopenia 2013 Clinical. Practice Guide on. Thrombocytopenia in Pregnancy. Presented by the American. Society of Hematology. Anita Rajasekhar, MD, MS Gestational Thrombocytopenia is a disorder similar to immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and is difficult to differentiate between the two disorders. Therefore, a medical history is conducted to because a diagnostic test is unavailable.  Signs and symptoms  Although there are no alarming symptoms related to gestational thrombocytopenia, an individual with thrombocytopenia might show the following symptoms – * Nose bleeds * Gums bleeding * Blood in urine/stool * Easily bruised * Enlarged spleen * Jaundice * Continuous bleeding due to cuts * Heavy menstrual flow * Rash-like spots (petechiae), mainly on the lower legs  Causes  It is evident that there is a decrease in platelet count during pregnancy; however, the cause of the decrease is unknown. However researchers theorize that the decrease in platelet count is due to the decreased production of platelets and/or increased destruction of platelets. Mechanism Generally, there is a decrease in platelet count in pregnant women and it will be due to many reasons. The two main causes of thrombocytopenia are a decrease in the production of platelets in the bone marrow and an increase in the destruction of the platelets. Platelets, along with other components of the blood, are produced in the spongy tissue found in the bone, known as bone marrow. Low platelet count maybe due to the decreased production of platelets in the bone marrow. A decreased production would be due to vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency, aplastic anemia, viral infections, chemotherapy, alcohol consumption, leukemia, myelodysplasia, and cirrhosis. During pregnancy, the fetus’ waste products diffuse into the mother’s sinuses (blood stream), and cause the mother's spleen to become overactive and enlarged. Normally, the spleen filters and removes the waste products and with the overload of unwanted substances in the bloodstream, the spleen will remove blood cells too quickly or store the platelets. In both cases, the overactive spleen would cause a decrease in the circulation of the platelets.  Diagnosis  Gestational thrombocytopenia will become evident during the mid-second trimester through the third trimester of pregnancy and it is diagnosed based on exclusion. For example, women with a history of immune thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia, prior to pregnancy, will not be diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia. Patients with low platelet counts, lower than 70,000 / μL, will be difficult to diagnose. The reason is because low platelet counts maybe due to gestational thrombocytopenia or immune thrombocytopenia.Gernsheimer, T., A. H. James, and R. Stasi. \\"How I Treat Thrombocytopenia in Pregnancy.\\" Blood 121.1 (2012): 38-47. Web. In such cases, a treatment of immune thrombocytopenia therapy (corticosteroids, or intravenous immunoglobulin) will be instructed. If there is an improvement in the platelet levels, the patient will be diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia, and if not the patient will be diagnosed with severe gestational thrombocytopenia In order for the physician to determine the underlying cause of the gestational thrombocytopenia, the following tests are conducted -  Blood Test  During routine prenatal checkups, the physician will conduct a complete blood count test to determine the components of blood. The complete blood count will provide further information about platelet levels along. The physician may conduct a blood test for platelet antibodies, which maybe produced as a result of a certain drug, such as quinine. The physician may also conduct blood clot test by adding chemicals to blood to determine how long it takes for the blood to clot.  Ultrasound  The physician may conduct an ultrasound around the spleen to determine if the spleen is enlarged due to an overactive spleen. The ultrasound will provide an image of the spleen and the doctor will compare it to a normal sized spleen.  Bone Marrow Aspiration and/or Biopsy  The physician may conduct a bone marrow aspiration and/or bone marrow biopsy, if they suspect there is a decreased production of platelets in the bone marrow. A bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy may be conducted at the same time.  Prevention  There is no known information regarding the prevention of this disorder. There is no known information regarding the group of women who are likely to be diagnosed with this disorder.  Treatment  Women, diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia, will have their complete blood test conducted during each pre-natal visit and monitored by the doctor. Having diagnosed gestational thrombocytopenia, women should continue their normal activities because the diagnosis does not change the management of pregnancy. Also, the diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia poses no harm or risk to the mother or the fetus.Myers, Bethan, and Edward Truelove. \\"Diagnosis And Management Of Thrombocytopenia In Pregnancy.\\" Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review Fet. Matern. Med. Rev. 22.02 (2011): 144-67. Web. There are no diagnostic tests available for gestational thrombocytopenia; rather it is diagnosed based on exclusion. Women who have a history of immune thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia prior to becoming pregnant would not be diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia Women who have platelet levels lower than 70,000 / μL, during pregnancy, maybe experiencing severe gestational thrombocytopenia or immune thrombocytopenia. In such cases, if the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia therapy (corticosteroids, or intravenous immunoglobulin) does not improve the platelet count, the patient will be diagnosed with severe gestational thrombocytopenia. Severe gestational thrombocytopenia may pose a risk for complications with the use of epidural or general anesthesia during delivery.  Prognosis  Those who have no previous history of thrombocytopenia, besides the occurrence in previous pregnancies (gestational thrombocytopenia), the platelet levels will go back to a normal range 1–2 months after the delivery. Post delivery, approximately 1–3 months later, women with gestational thrombocytopenia should have a complete blood test conducted. Lastly, gestational thrombocytopenia is a disorder that may reoccur in future pregnancies  Research  Roberto Stasi, a researcher in the department of Haematology at the St. Georges Hospital in London, UK brings up an excellent point of being able to know the precise diagnosis of the disorder during the stages of pregnancy. This would help physicians treat the patient and help the patient with the management of the pregnancy. History A history of this disorder has not yet been established.

Dr, Joseph R. Sizoo, the church's minister, arguing that the church was \\"a shrine\\" and its sale would put the dollar sign before the cross. Despite initial success, the pastor, Rev. Dr. Malcolm James MacLeod, later reneged on the church's intention to sell to the Rockefeller complex for as much as $7 million. the tension between the minister with congregation and the pro-sale church governing body led most of the congregation and Sizoo to leave.

Its quasi-official nickname is a reference to its polished black granite cladding and irregular angles. Designed by Danish architects Schmidt Hammer Lassen, the Black Diamond was completed in 1999 as the first in a series of large-scale cultural buildings along Copenhagen's waterfront. Apart from its function as a library, the building houses a number of other public facilities and activities, most of which are located around the central, toplit atrium which cuts into the building with a huge glazed front facing the harbour. The facilities include a 600-seat auditorium, the Queen's Hall, used for concerts—mainly chamber music and jazz--literary events, theatrical performances and conferences. There are also exhibition spaces, a bookshop, a restaurant, a café and a roof terrace. Two museums are based in the Black Diamond, the National Museum of Photography and a small museum dedicated to cartoon art. History In the early 1990s, the Danish Ministry of Cultural Affairs launched an international architecture competition for the design of an extension to the Royal Library on Slotsholmen. The competition attracted 178 Danish and international architectural firms and ultimately Schmidt Hammer Lassen was chosen as the winner in 1993. Construction started in 1995. The cost of the building was DKK 465,000,000. The Ministry of Cultural Affairs was the builders and Moe and Brødsgaard A/S the consulting engineers. The Black Diamond was inaugurated on 7 September 1999 and opened to the public on 15 September 1999. The Minister of Cultural Affairs at the time, Jytte Hilden, named it the Black Diamond. Architecture Connection to the old building The basic shape of the Black Diamond is a box which leans to the left as seen from the harbour as well as towards the water. At the same time it expands slightly from the bottom and up and from north to south, giving it a distorted, prismatic shape. The building is clad in black granite of a type known as Absolute Black, which was mined in Zimbabwe and then cut and polished in Italy. The black cladding amounts to 2,500 square metres and each stone weighs 75 kg. A broad, glazed \\"crevasse\\" cleaves the facade into two, letting natural light into the central atrium inside the building. A glazed band also runs along the building's ground floor in its full height to allow for panoramic views of the waterfront from the inside while, at the same time, aiming to give the Diamond a floating appearance when seen from the water. The Black Diamond is separated from the old building, known as the Holm Building, by the busy thoroughfare Christians Brygge which runs along the waterfront. Several skyways connect the two buildings. View over the harbour from the atrium Atrium In contrast to the stringent and dark exterior the atrium creates a bright and organic central space in the library. It is toplit and bounded by wavy balconies. From the atrium a travelator leads up to the C level which holds the main library facilities. The Link The Link is a connecting walkway running from the foyer of the old main building of the library through a skywalk above Christians Brygge and the atrium along a gangway to the glazed facade with sweeping views of Christianshavn and Islands Brygge across the harbour. Library facilities The main floor of the library is the C level which is reached from the ground floor along a travelator. With the construction of the Black Diamond, the Royal Library on Slotsholmen has gained 21,500 square meters and now has six reading rooms compared to previously one and 474 reading and study seats compared to 96 prior to the extension. The Information Room holds 60 seats compared to the previous 46. Kirkeby-broen The circulation desk is located in the 18-metre-wide main skyway which connects the old and the new building above Christians Brygge. The Royal Library on Slotsholmen is not a public library where it is possible to locate and pick the books from open shelves and then borrow them for use outside the library. On the contrary, the books have to be ordered either through online or by filling out a requisition form in the catalogue room. The books can then be collected the next day. Reading rooms Looking into Reading Room West The reading rooms on level C to F all face the atrium which provides them with natural light. The reading rooms each consist of double-height rooms with a projecting mezzanine floor. The purposes of Reading Room West is to make it possible for users to study materials from the library’s collection which are restricted to the premises, and to make a large reference collection available for them. There are 160 study seats in the reading room and it is possible to obtain a permanent seat for a specific amount of time on application. The reference collection comprises a total of 65,000 volumes distributed over two floors. The emphasis of the collection is on the humanities and theology but all the library's subject fields are covered. The room has a specially secured area where protected material may be studied. It is possible to apply for a permanent study seat for a prescribed period. The Reading Room East has 130 study seats and its primary purpose is to give access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals and, at the same time, to provide a large number of study seats for other purposes. The preceding three years of publications of 4,000—3200 foreign and 800 Danish--periodicals are kept alphabetically along the shelves. There are 70,000 microfilm spools of both Danish and foreign newspapers. It is not possible to study restricted materials in this reading room. The target group is students and others, who require knowledge on a high level. The two remaining reading rooms located in the Black Diamond are those of the Centre for Maps, Prints and Photographs and the Centre for Music and Theatre. Queen's Hall The Dronningesalen auditorium The Queen's Hall is an auditorium seating up to 600 people. It is used for a variety of purposes, including concerts, conferences, film, ballet and theatre. The hall is equipped with a variable acoustic system which adapts to the specific type of music. Thereby the sound is adjustable to greater sonorousness, with longer reverberation for classical music and shorter reverberation for rhythmic music. Concerts The Queen Hall is primarily intended as a venue for classical, particularly chamber music, but also jazz and other forms of rhythmical music is played there. The Library has its own resident chamber music ensemble known as the Diamond Ensemble which is frequently joined by international guest musicians. The repertoire includes \\"exhibition concerts\\" of musical works from the Royal Library's music archives which are the largest in the Nordic Countries. Other concerts have been with Trio con Brio and Niels Lan Doky. International Authors' Stage The Queen's Hall is also used for a programme of lectures by leading International writers and intellectuals. Upcoming or previous speakers include Uwe Tellkamp, Martin Walser, Günter Wallraff, Ingo Schulze, Jonathan Safran Foer, Lars Saabye Christensen, Ben Okri, Juli Zeh, Günter Grass, Salman Rushdie, Siegfried Lenz, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Per Olov Enquist, Kristín Marja Baldursdóttir, Einar Már Guðmundsson, Julia Franck, Slavoj Žižek, Åsne Seierstad, Kofi Annan, Caitlin Moran, Siri Hustvedt, Paul Auster, and Alaa Al Aswany. Exhibitions The Black Diamond has two main exhibition areas. The larger of the two is the Peristyle (Danish: Søjlehallen) which covers 600 square metres and is located at level K. It hosts a variety of cultural and historical exhibitions, including those held by the National Museum of Photography. The other, the Montana Hall, was created in 2009 and serves as the treasury of the library. It is here that the rarest pieces from the national heritage are exhibited. National Museum of Photography National Museum of Cartoon Art The Danish Museum of Cartoon Art is located on level B with the so-called Gallery Corridor serving as the museum's exhibition space. Larger exhibitions--of which there generally is one a year--are held in the exhibition area at level K. The museum figures under the Centre for Maps, Prints and Photographs. The first major exhibition consisted of drawings by the Danish artist Bo Bojesen. Artwork Kirkeby fresco Per Kirkeby's nameless fresco The Danish artist Per Kirkeby has created a 210 square metre titleless fresco at the entrance to the lending section and reading rooms at level C. The painting is one of the largest ceiling decorations in the Nordic countries and it took Per Kirkeby more than a year to complete. Executed in oils, the colourful and organic painting creates a striking contrast to the minimalist surroundings and the adjacent cleavage in glass and steel. Katalog sound ornament - Music at One Katalog (English: Catalogue) is a music piece composed specially for the Black Diamond by Danish composer Fuzzy as a new artistic decoration. It consists of an electroacoustic composition, around three minutes long, for every week of the year. Every day at 1 pm the composition is broadcast in the atrium via a permanent installation based on a computerized 12-channel loudspeaker system, in which every loudspeaker can be programmed individually. Four loudspeakers are installed in the ceiling of each of the three balcony levels. With each of the 52 compositions inspired by one of the library's treasures, either a manuscript, a photo, a book, or a piece of music, it is intended as a tribute to and promotion of the library's collections and at the same time as an opportunity for the users to look up from their books and take a break.

It was also simulcast to Irish viewers on RTÉ One. The episode was commissioned as part of the show's 25th anniversary celebrations, and was the first EastEnders episode to be broadcast live. It was the series' 3952nd episode, and was written by Simon Ashdown, directed by Clive Arnold and produced by Diederick Santer. The episode concludes a \\"whodunnit\\" storyline \\"Who Killed Archie?\\", about the murder of Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), revealing his killer to be Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner). It also sees the exit of Charlie Clements as Stacey's husband Bradley Branning, who dies after falling from the roof of The Queen Victoria public house. Turner only learned that Stacey was Archie's killer half an hour before the episode aired, in a bid by the production team to maintain the storyline's secrecy. 51 EastEnders cast members appeared in the episode, with several expressing trepidation about performing live prior to the broadcast. Cast members had two weeks to rehearse the episode, with one rehearsal filmed in case of any serious problems during transmission. When Turner fell ill with the flu on the day of broadcast, it was feared the producers may have needed to use the pre-recorded tape, but in the event she recovered enough to appear. \\"EastEnders Live\\" was Santer's final episode as EastEnders executive producer. He expressed his pleasure with the episode, despite several errors during transmission, including mis-delivered lines and some problems with sound and camera shots. Viewers gambled on the identity of the killer, with bookmakers Ladbrokes experiencing record levels of gambling on a television series, and William Hill taking £500,000, surpassing the amount placed on the outcome of Dallas Who shot J.R.? storyline in 1980. The episode was watched by 19.9 million cumulative viewers, becoming the most watched show of the year to date. EastEnders Live: The Aftermath, a documentary which followed the episode on BBC Three, was seen by 4.54 million viewers, drawing the station's highest ever ratings. \\"EastEnders Live\\" received mixed reviews from critics. It was described as \\"a triumph\\" by Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph, praised by Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent for including stunt work, and commended for Clements and Turner's acting by Tim Teeman of The Times. In contrast, however, The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith felt that viewers would be \\"incredulous\\" with the episode's outcome, and Cate Devine of The Herald criticised problems with lighting and sound effects. Plot In the wake of their second wedding, husband Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) and his wife Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) prepare to flee Walford - with Bradley urged to do so by his father and uncle after becoming the prime suspect in the police investigation of the murder of local landlord Archie Mitchell (see \\"Who Killed Archie?\\"). Bradley's father Max Branning (Jake Wood) distracts the police while Bradley and Stacey attempt to escape from Albert Square. Elsewhere, Archie's youngest daughter Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) suspects that her sister Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) is the murderer. She accuses Ronnie, who tells her that their father raped Stacey, and thereupon reveals that he did the same to her when she was a child. Ronnie and Roxy's cousin Phil (Steve McFadden) ransacks the home of his stepson Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), believing that Ian has in his possession a cufflink which would implicate him in Archie's murder. He exits without finding it, leaving Ian and their elderly neighbour Dot Branning (June Brown) to watch an old videotape of their family and friends from the past 25 years - reminiscing about the past. Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) is accused by her stepdaughter, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), of attempting to frame her for the murder. As Janine prepares to flee Walford, Peggy finds Roxy and Ronnie fighting. She tells the girls that she too was present the night Archie was killed, arriving to find him injured but alive, however left without calling for medical help. Outside, Bradley and Stacey are about to take a taxi to St Pancras railway station when Bradley realises he has forgotten their passports. He tells Stacey to wait and hurries back home to collect them, but is spotted by the police. A chase ensues, and Bradley climbs onto the roof of The Queen Victoria pub in an attempt to escape. He shouts for Stacey to run before losing his footing and falling from the roof. He dies from his injuries as a distressed Stacey reaches him and the residents look on in horror. Stacey is comforted by Max, and confesses that she is the one who killed Archie.

The air date was set for 19 February 2010, with the episode to be broadcast from the BBC's Elstree Studios in Borehamwood. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer initially refrained from discussing the episode's plot, but commented that it would resolve a \\"big storyline\\" which would \\"keep the audience (as well as the cast and crew) guessing until the very last moment.\\" EastEnders storylines saw Archie Mitchell, landlord of The Queen Victoria public house murdered on Christmas Day 2009, with many characters considered potential suspects in the crime. Santer confirmed that the killer would be revealed in the live episode, and that their identity would be kept secret until the night of broadcast, even from the cast member playing them. Another aspect of the episode is the remarriage of characters Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Santer deemed it the \\"soap wedding of the year—and perhaps the soap wedding of the decade\\", commenting that playing the romance against the \\"thriller\\" of the \\"whodunnit\\" storyline provided a balance he hoped audiences would be \\"gripped by and satisfied with.\\" Cast In November 2009, actor Charlie Clements, announced that he would be leaving the soap in 2010. It was rumoured that Bradley would be seen to commit suicide during the live episode, but this was refuted by an EastEnders spokesperson. Bradley made his last appearance in the live episode, urged to flee Walford by his father Max and uncle Jack (Scott Maslen) after becoming the prime suspect in the investigation into Archie's murder. Bradley's motive for murder came from the discovery that Archie raped his partner Stacey. In an interview with daytime television show This Morning, Clements stated it was possible that Bradley was responsible, but was unsure whether he \\"[had] it in him\\", though felt that it would be \\"quite historical to go down as the one who killed Archie Mitchell\\". In the event, Bradley exited the soap by falling to his death from the roof of The Queen Victoria public house during the live episode. Immediately after filming, Clements stated that he was \\"drained\\", referring to his character's death as \\"a big way to go out.\\" In total, 51 EastEnders cast members were involved in the live broadcast. Several cast members expressed trepidation at the prospect of the live episode. Before details of the episode's plot were confirmed, Turner hoped that she would not be involved in it, deeming herself \\"awful\\" at performing live, unable to even deliver speeches. Neil McDermott feared that he would lose his composure and laugh during the broadcast, while Palmer hoped that the episode would not turn into a pantomime, commenting: \\"I hope we're a bit more professional than that.\\" Simons stated that she was looking forward to the challenge the episode presented, though she would be happier once she had seen the script. Clements denied any apprehension, likening the performance to acting in theatre, and Nina Wadia stated that she was \\"really looking forward to it\\", enjoying experiences with an \\"adrenaline rush.\\" Once the script was released, Wadia was \\"disappointed yet relieved\\" to learn she did not have a speaking role, explaining: \\"You want to be in it, but not to mess it up.\\" She expected to feel \\"uncomfortable\\" during the broadcast, as the episode is set the day before her character Zainab Masood gives birth, necessitating the wearing of a body suit with a large \\"baby bump\\" sewn in. Rehearsals The EastEnders cast and crew had two weeks to rehearse the episode prior to its live transmission. The script was issued on the afternoon of 5 February 2010, written by series consultant and lead show writer Simon Ashdown. The first read-through took place on 8 February 2010, though producers held back the part of the script revealing Archie's true killer. Eight different possible endings were rehearsed, with Santer reiterating that the actor playing the killer would only be told so on the night of broadcast. He revealed that the actor playing the killer would be informed of their actions at 7:30 pm on 19 February, 30 minutes before the episode's transmission, with their reaction filmed for the documentary EastEnders Live: The Aftermath, which aired on BBC Three immediately after \\"EastEnders Live\\" was broadcast, narrated by Lamb's son George. Santer explained that the killer \\"may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square\\", preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast. Actress Charlie Brooks, who plays Archie's former lover Janine Butcher, found the secrecy difficult to work with, explaining: \\"In the episodes to be shown afterwards, you’re being told to look or speak a certain way, but not why.\\" Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging, stating: \\"They are as desperate to know who did it as the viewers\\", though believed they were all capable of coping with the pressure of the live episode. He explained that the cast typically film scenes in one take anyway, and observed that several EastEnders actors had formerly appeared in live broadcasts for other series. Cast members had just two dress rehearsals in advance of the live episode, and only one read-through of the entire episode. Directing Arnold was initially sceptical when approached about directing \\"EastEnders Live\\", but agreed once it was explained that the impetus for the episode was motivated by the \\"whodunnit\\" storyline. He explained: \\"We pre-record TV drama for lots of very good reasons and doing a live episode can sometimes come across a little gimmicky, so for me, story is the one and only reason a drama should go live.\\" Direction of the episode differed from typical episodes of EastEnders, whereby actors briefly run through their lines, block the scene to be filmed, then begin shooting with the director on the studio floor. For \\"EastEnders Live\\", cast and crew had two weeks to work on the episode, rehearsing, blocking scenes and discussing the characters' journeys at length. Once technical rehearsals began and cameras were added in, Arnold moved from the studio floor to an outside broadcast truck. All cameras on set were cabled to the truck, allowing Arnold to oversee the entire episode remotely. Arnold approached the episode as though it were a theatrical performance, explaining: \\"We can work on performance and blocking early on, discussing issues and discovering the text as we go. Actors know to save their energy when technical rehearsals are taking place and then it's quite magical when all elements are combined close to the first performance. Of course, our theatre company will have opening and closing night on Friday, February 19!\\" Filming In case of any serious problems during transmission, a rehearsal for the episode was filmed, including each version of the reveal scene. Santer explained that the tape would not be used for minor problems such as cast members forgetting their lines, in which instance: \\"we'll power on using our improvisational skills. It's really just for technical backup in case of a proper crisis.\\" The live broadcast took 400 camera shots to film, and 36 camera operators. Typical episodes of EastEnders utilise just four camera operators. Two outside broadcast trucks were hired to remotely direct and monitor the episode from, and three golf buggies were used to transport cast between sets, as the minimum length of time actors had to move from one set to another was just 131 seconds. Arnold explained that filming \\"EastEnders Live\\" to look like a typical episode of EastEnders was difficult, giving the example of a scene involving a ringing mobile phone. In a usual EastEnders episode, the viewer would see a shot of the phone and know who was calling. In the live episode, the caller would have to be visually or audibly obvious, as a result of the camera set-up and inability to edit scenes. He described the episode's biggest limitation as the weather, explaining that \\"EastEnders Live\\" begins with a direct pickup from the previous episode of EastEnders, with the same characters in the same outside location, leaving the crew hoping for a dry night. Sound was also a problem, as sound quality is better using boom rods than radio microphones, but booms often dip into shot during the filming of EastEnders. Arnold commented that the production crew would be using booms where possible, but that all cast members with dialogue would be given a radio microphone as backup. Broadcast On the day of broadcast, The Mirror reported that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than go ahead with the live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was \\"such a big part of TV history\\". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine \\"June\\" and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots \\"misfired\\". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, \\"to get it all out\\". During a scene in which Roxy and Ronnie argued in the Minute Mart, Womack took a bottle of paint stripper from the shelves, but forgot to stop at the counter to pay for it before exiting. Santer, who stood down as executive producer after the episode's transmission, succeeded by Bryan Kirkwood, commented that he was happy, relieved and proud with the broadcast. Santer stated: \\"I just think everyone did brilliantly tonight—the cast, the crew, everyone. It's everything I wished for and more. I'm thrilled with how it went. It was quite remarkable. Everything went to plan. I spotted a couple of little wobbles but what I was proudest of was the recovery. The technical crew, the cast—every time we maybe veered slightly off course, they pulled it back round.\\" Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner was surprised to learn that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: \\"She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death. I think that's going to hurt her more than anything.\\" Reception Pre-broadcast commentary In the weeks preceding the transmission of \\"EastEnders Live\\", the episode prompted a series of retrospective articles in the British print media, examining EastEnders development over its 25 years of broadcast. Critical commentary was mixed. The Guardian Dan Sabbagh observed that the storylines which will culminate in \\"EastEnders Live\\"—Ricky and Bianca's remarriage and the Archie Mitchell \\"whodunnit\\"—have seen the show undergo a revival, overtaking rival soap opera Coronation Street in the ratings for the first time in over three years. Tim Teeman of The Times highlighted the Archie storyline as representative of male characters in EastEnders offering an \\"essential foil\\" to their female counterparts, who he appraised as being \\"key\\" to the show's success, using the example of Archie's relationship with his wife Peggy and daughter Ronnie. He felt that the episode deserved high viewership, deeming EastEnders \\"a brilliant drama\\". Conversely, Alison Rowat of The Herald felt that the current storylines indicated \\"the best days of EE are over\\", commenting: \\"Contrast it with the ever sprightly Coronation Street, where the scenes featuring Gail “Black Widow” McIntyre and her lucky white heather husband have been perfect soap fare. What does EastEnders have? Another murder investigation in a place that has a higher homicide rate than The Wire Baltimore. Andrew Billen of The Times refuted claims by the BBC that \\"EastEnders Live\\" was not a \\"gimmick\\" but in fact proof of the soap's \\"innovative vigour\\". Billen deemed the live episode a \\"reactionary move\\", observing that Coronation Street had aired a live episode for its 40th anniversary in 2000. He reminded readers: \\"live television drama is nothing new but rather harks back to the earliest days of television and, beyond them, to theatre itself.\\" The Mirror Jane Simon hoped for multiple errors during the transmission of \\"EastEnders Live\\", commenting: \\"It's time EastEnders gave us a laugh.\\" Gambling In a world first, online gambling company Bodog offered live odds during the episode, allowing viewers to continue to bet on the identity of Archie's killer as events unfolded. Although \\"in-running\\" betting is common during sports events, it had never before been offered for a soap opera. Odds on the killer's identity changed frequently in the fortnight preceding the transmission of \\"EastEnders Live\\". On 5 February, the clear favourite was Stacey, with odds at Bodog of 2/1. By 9 February, Stacey's odds had shortened to 6/4, though the character dropped into third place by 12 February, usurped by her brother Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) at odds of 9/4, and Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) at 7/2. On 14 February, the unlikely favourite became Tracey the barmaid (Jane Slaughter), a background character whose odds shortened considerably from 40/1 to 11/4. Sean moved back into first place on 16 February, with odds of 2/1, and remained there until the eve of broadcast. Bookmakers estimated that over £1 million would be spent gambling on the outcome of the storyline. Ladbrokes experienced its busiest ever 24 hours of gambling on a television series ahead of the episode's transmission, taking £100,000 in bets on 30 different characters, while William Hill took £500,000, surpassing the amount placed on Dallas Who shot J.R.? storyline in 1980. Spokesman Rupert Adams commented: \\"The BBC were amazing keeping this quiet. We have broken even which in a market like this is amazing. We have had a roller-coaster but have enjoyed every minute.\\" Ratings \\"EastEnders Live\\" was watched by a cumulative audience of 19.9 million viewers. Its original screening averaged 16.41 million viewers, attaining a 57% audience share. Three repeats on BBC Two and BBC Three in the week of broadcast lifted the televised total to 18.8 million viewers, with a further 1.1 million watching the episode on BBC iPlayer. The episode became the most watched show of the year to date. EastEnders Live: The Aftermath drew a total of 11.6 million viewers. It was watched by 4.54 million people on its initial airing, attaining a 15.9% audience share and becoming BBC Three's highest rated programme ever, as well as the most-watched multichannel programme of the day. The documentary drew a further 6.6 million viewers over four repeat broadcasts, and 0.5 million viewers via iPlayer. The original broadcast was the third highest rated television episode of 2010 in the UK, beaten by a 2010 FIFA World Cup match between England and Germany, and the final of the seventh series of The X Factor. Santer was delighted by the viewing figures, stating: \\"To get this incredible response from the audience is truly remarkable—these numbers go far beyond what we ever hoped for. I am so proud of our cast and crew for their incredible performance last night. This rating is the icing on our silver anniversary cake.\\" Jay Hunt, controller of BBC One commented: \\"[The] extraordinary live episode was a fitting celebration of 25 magnificent years for EastEnders. The audience were clearly gripped by one of the greatest soap whodunnits ever.\\" Discussing the ratings for EastEnders Live: The Aftermath, controller of BBC Three Danny Cohen appraised: \\"It is an amazing testament to the EastEnders team and the brave and brilliant drama they provided.\\" Yorke responded to the high consolidated ratings with the statement: \\"The best birthday present EastEnders could possibly have is to know that 25 years in it can still grab the biggest audience in the UK. It's a real tribute to the show's creators that a quarter of a century on, everybody's still talking about it.\\" Critical response The episode won in the \\"Best Single Episode\\" category at the 2010 British Soap Awards, and was nominated in the \\"Best Live Event Coverage\\" category of the Broadcast Digital Awards 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics. Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent rated \\"EastEnders Live\\" 4 out of 5, noting that there were \\"a couple of moments where the seams showed\\", but that \\"half the fun in watching was seeing if you could spot them\\". He praised EastEnders for not \\"playing safe\\" by including stunt work, and commented that Ian Beale's line: \\"I wish we could go back and do it all again. Do it right this time.\\" could potentially have been \\"a horrible hostage to fortune\\", however felt that: \\"in the end they more than got away with it.\\" Tim Teeman of The Times also rated the episode 4 out of 5, calling the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a \\"genuine surprise\\", and commenting that \\"EastEnders Live\\": \\"sometimes creaked under the weight of its own ambitions – but who cares, gold stars for effort.\\" Teeman praised Clements and Turner, feeling that they \\"excelled themselves despite the odd strained pause\\", though noted that in the aftermath of Bradley's fall, \\"the perils of live TV became apparent\\", commenting that: \\"The direction slackened at just the wrong moment, and you were left hoping someone would get to a bit of script to ward off any more bizarre shots of Jack and Max fighting to free themselves from a policeman's soft grip.\\" Mike Higgins of The Independent deemed the episode \\"a technical triumph\\", praising the \\"smooth, almost flawless\\" and \\"fluent\\" production. Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph also called the episode a \\"triumph\\", opining that it could not possibly have lived up to the hype surrounding the storyline, but that transmitting live gave EastEnders \\"an energy it normally lacks, with great violence, excellent direction\\". He summarised: \\"the story gripped so well you forgot to look for the cock-ups, before a genuinely shocking denouement that you never saw coming amid all of the hype.\\" Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was \\"a slight let-down\\" and \\"a little bit predictable\\", calling the episode \\"a triumph of logistics over logic\\". However, Stacey wrote that aside from the \\"damp-squib\\" ending, \\"EastEnders Live\\" was \\"surprisingly enjoyable [...] even for a committed 'Endersphobe like [her]self.\\" She felt that transmitting live \\"added a tangible layer of tension\\" to proceedings, lamenting: \\"If only EastEnders was this exciting all the time.\\" The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith similarly felt that transmitting live made for \\"tension, not clarity\\", commenting that bookmakers would be \\"absolutely delighted\\" with the outcome, but that viewers would be \\"incredulous\\". Cate Devine of The Herald was similarly critical, describing the episode as \\"30 minutes of cheesy dramatic counterpoint\\", and highlighting the \\"ropey lighting and poor sound effects.\\" Bradley's death was voted the third most emotional moment in television entertainment in a 2010 poll of 3,000 British people conducted by Freeview HD.

TK-6 is the type strain for this species. It is a Gram negative, non-motile, obligate chemolithoautotroph. It belongs to one of the earliest branching order of Bacteria. H. thermophilus TK-6 lives in soil that contains hot water. It was one of the first hydrogen oxidizing bacteria described leading to the discovery, and subsequent examination of many unique proteins involved in its metabolism. Its discovery contradicted the idea that no obligate hydrogen oxidizing bacteria existed, leading to a new understanding of this physiological group. Additionally, H. thermophilus contains a fatty acid composition that had not been observed before. History Hydrogenobacter thermophilus TK-6 was originally discovered by Toshiyuki Kawasumi at the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, University of Tokyo in 1980. TK-6 was found with four other previously unknown hydrogen oxidizing bacteria. The bacterium was isolated from hot water containing soils samples from mines of the Izu Peninsula, Japan. The colonies were isolated onto a medium made of 1.5% Bacto-Agar and a specific trace element solution consisting of MoO3, ZnSO4·H2O, CuSO4·5H2O, H3BO3, MnSO4·H2O and CoCl2·H2O. Prior to the discovery of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, only one extremely thermophilic, aerobic and hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium had been described (Bacillus schlegelii). In addition, H. thermophilus has both morphological and physiological differences that vary from processes in B. schegelii, suggesting there are multiple means for being viable in different environments. Until the discovery of H. thermophilus, it was thought that no obligate chemolithotrophic hydrogen oxidizing bacteria existed. Characterization Biology Hydrogenobacter thermophilus is a straight rod (bacillus) bacterium and an extreme thermophile. The size is about .3-.5 microns in width and 2-3 microns in length. Gram staining was done using a Hucker Modification and the reaction was found to be Gram negative. Motility and sporulation were tested using hanging cell method and Dorner method, respectively, and both were found to be negative. The novel fatty acid composition was freed though a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate containing solution. The composition was found to be C18:0, C 20:1, 2 carbons longer than any composition seen before. The optimum growth conditions are: temperature between 70 and 75 °C, freshwater, pH around 7.2. The habitat is soil that contains hot, fresh water (70-75 °C) from springs of the Izu Peninsula, Japan. Metabolism Hydrogenobacter thermophilus is an obligate chemolithoautotroph. H. thermophilus undergoes aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration via denitrification. The electron donor is the molecular form of hydrogen, thiosulfate, or elemental sulfur. Nitrogen sources are Ammonium and Nitrate salts. This bacterium utilizes a special form of the reductive tricyclic acid cycle (Reverse Krebs cycle) to fix CO2. Various metabolic processes were examined on a 1.5% Bacto-Agar with various organic compounds, incubated at 50-70 degrees C. Phylogeny 16S rRNA gene sequencing places the family of H. thermophilus, Aquificaceae, in close phylogenetic relationship to the family Aquifex based on 88.5% to 88.9% sequence similarity. H. thermophilus’s next immediate branch point is with the species Caldobacterium hydrogenopailum str. z-823 and the previous divergence branches with Hydrogenobacter strains. Genomic studies of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in H. thermophilus also suggest that they are part of some of the earliest differentiating orders of bacteria termed the Aquificales. As a result of the early branch point in Aquificales’ genetic history, it indicates that the characteristics of the last common ancestor of life were possibly thermophilic and fixed carbon chemoautotrophically; this gives some direction to the evolution of life. Genomics In 2010, the entire genome of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus TK-6 was sequenced by Hiroyuki Arai et al. Sequencing was done via whole genome shotgun approach through the Sanger sequencing method, and assembled via the Paracel Genome Assembler. It was found to consist of 1,743,135 base pairs arranged in a circular chromosome with an estimated 1,864 protein coding genes and 22 pseudogenes. The genome was found to contain one 16S-23S-5S rRNA operon and 44 tRNA coding genes. The GC content of the genome is 44%, which at the time of its discovery was the lowest among any hydrogen oxidizing bacteria. H. thermophilus contains four gene clusters for membrane-bound hydrogenases. It should also be noted that H. thermophilus lacks the typical PSP (phosphoserine phosphatase) genes involved in amino acid metabolism. In addition, it is an obligate chemolithoautotroph, and so genes commonly used in carbon fixation were present. Genes that encode proteins involved in the RTCA (reductive tricyclic acid cycle) and gluconeogenesis were observed. The sox gene cluster, sqr gene and sorAB genes were also noted, and are involved in the sulfur oxidation protein complex, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase and sulfite:cytochrome c oxidoreductase respectively. H. thermophilus also contains the necessary genes for nitrate reduction and assimilation. Proteomics Hydrogenobacter thermophilus has several unique proteins that allow it to be viable in its environment. Cytochrome b and cytochrome c are present in all strains. H. thermophilus strains also possess a very distinctive sulfur containing quinone, 2-Methylthio-1,4-naphthoquinone. This is the first case of non-Calvin-type pathway that is utilized to convert carbon dioxide into cellular components. In addition to the unique quinone, novel types of phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPs) were discovered and have been analyzed by preliminary crystallization and X-ray diffraction. Both iPSP1 and iPSP2 proteins found in H. thermophilus employ metal-ion-independent pathways while typical PSPs need Mg2+ for activity and are considered to be part of the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase superfamily. iPSP1 is composed of two PspA subunits, while iPSP2 is a heterodimer and has both PspA and PspB subunits. iPSP1 and iPSP2 were observed to share a strong binding affinity towards L-phosphoserine, which supports its activity as a PSP. Novel proteins such as citryl-CoA synthetase (CCS) and ciitryl-CoA (CLL)are utilized within the reductive TCA cycle (Reverse Krebs cycle). These proteins were discovered and characterized through activity purification, SDS-PAGE analysis, and gel filtration chromatography. Additionally, oligionucleotide probes were employed in order to sequence and clone the related genes. The cleavage of citryl-CoA to acetyl- CoA and oxaloacetate occurs in a two step process. First, citryl-coA synthetase catalyzes the formation of citryl-CoA, which is immediately cleaved by citryl-CoA lyase. It was also observed that there is significant level of protein sequence homology between the CCL protein and the C-terminal region of ATP citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme commonly employed by the reductive TCA cycle.

He was instrumental in the Ukrainian cultural revival of the late 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. Hrinchenko was an editor of various Ukrainian periodicals. He was one of the founders of the Ukrainian Radical Party. Hrinchenko also was an author of seminal ethnographic, lexicographic, and pedagogical works, literary studies, historical reviews, the first textbooks in the Ukrainian language, particularly Native word, the school-book for reading. He was an editor of the four-volume Словарь української мови (Ukrainian Dictionary; \\"Kievskaya starina\\" publishing, Kiev 1907–1909). One of the organizers and the first director of the Prosvita Society in Kyiv. Biography Borys Hrinchenko was born on December 9, 1863 in the khutir of Vilkhovy Yar, in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire (today, a village of Ruski Tyshky, Kharkiv Raion), but was baptized in the Archangel- Michael church in a village of Borshcheve.Birth certificate His father was a retired army officer of an impoverished noble heritage. His mother Poliksenia Litryova, a daughter of a colonel.Cherkaska, H. Borys Hrinchenko and his Ukrainian feat. Uamodna. 22 December 2014 His family possessed 19 desyatinas () of land, mostly forest and a water mill. His father knew Ukrainian well and used it only when talked with neighboring peasants, whereas at home everyone in the family spoke Russian. Before enrolling in the Kharkiv city secondary school (so called realschule), young Hrinchenko was home schooled. At the fifth grade he was imprisoned on 29 December 1879 \\"for possession and distribution\\" of Serhiy Podolynsky's banned book \\"Steam Machine\\" (, 1875). He was excluded from school and spent couple of months in prison where he became sick on tuberculosis. After about a year of exile to his father's estate, he returned to Kharkiv and worked as a tutor, earning money to obtain a diploma from Kharkiv University as a people's educator. He died on May 6, 1910 in the town of Ospedaletti in Liguria, Italy.

His nom de guerre was \\"Angie\\". In 1975, Klein participated in an attack on OPEC headquarters in Vienna organized by the international terrorist \\"Carlos the Jackal\\", in which he was seriously injured. He publicly renounced political violence two years later. After decades in hiding, he was arrested in 1998, prosecuted for his role in the OPEC attack, and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. He was paroled in 2003. Biography Childhood Klein came from a working-class background.Varon 231 His mother was imprisoned in Ravensbrück concentration camp for Rassenschande (\\"racial pollution\\") during World War II. She killed herself a few months after Klein was born and he spent some time in a foster home after her death. Klein was physically abused by his father, who took custody of him again after he remarried. For most of his life Klein believed incorrectly that his father had been an SS member and his mother had been Jewish.Follain 78 Activism and violence In the 1970s Klein worked for the legal Red Army Faction prisoner support group Red Aid (Rote Hilfe) in Frankfurt and subsequently for the RAF lawyer Klaus Croissant in Stuttgart. At one point he shared a Frankfurt commune with Joschka Fischer and Daniel Cohn- Bendit. He served as Jean-Paul Sartre's chauffeur when Sartre visited the imprisoned Andreas Baader in December 1974. He joined the RZ in 1975. Klein has described Holger Meins' death on hunger strike as inspiring his turn to violence; he carried a photo of Meins' emaciated body in his wallet. He took part in the 1975 attack organized by Carlos the Jackal on an OPEC conference in Vienna, in which three people were killed and Klein himself shot in the stomach. Klein renounced terrorism in 1977, sending a letter to Der Spiegel (with his gun enclosed) in which he warned of planned RZ attacks on two leaders of the German Jewish community.Follain, John. Jackal: the Complete Story of the Legendary Terrorist, Carlos the Jackal. New York: Arcade Pub., 1998. pp. 110. He then went underground, hiding from his former comrades as well as the police. Klein further explained his change of views in a 1978 interview with the French journalist Jean-Marcel Bouguereau and a 1979 book entitled Mercenary Death, for which Cohn-Bendit wrote the foreword. In 1995, Klein was tracked down and interviewed (in disguise) by Daniel Leconte for French television.This was part of a two-episode documentary about Carlos the Jackal called The Carlos Years. Excerpts are among the DVD \\"Special Features\\" of Carlos (2010). Arrest and subsequent events After spending two decades in hiding, mostly in France, in September 1998 he was apprehended in the Normandy village of Sainte-Honorine-la-Guillaume, where he had been living for five years. After his arrest several German and French public figures, including Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Bouguereau, and André Glucksmann, stated publicly that they had been aware of Klein's location and had assisted him during his time in hiding. Eighteen months after his arrest Klein was extradited to Germany to stand trial for his role in the OPEC attack. At trial Klein admitted participating in the attack, but denied having killed anyone. He also testified that Libya had assisted in the raid, giving the attackers weapons and information on the conference's security arrangements. Joschka Fischer, then Germany's Foreign Minister, testified at his trial as a character witness; his presence intensified the controversy then playing out over his radical past. In February 2001, after a four-month trial, Klein was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and hostage taking, and sentenced to nine years in prison. The prosecution had asked for 14 years, but Klein was given a lighter sentence because he provided authorities with information about other participants in the attack. In 2003 he was released on parole and returned to Normandy. In popular culture Klein was the subject of the 2006 documentary My Life as a Terrorist, directed by Alexander Oey. He also appeared in the 2007 documentaries Protagonist and Terror's Advocate. He was portrayed by Christoph Bach in the 2010 French television miniseries Carlos.  Personal life  Klein is married to a French woman and has two children.  Notes  References * Follain, John. Jackal: the Complete Story of the Legendary Terrorist, Carlos the Jackal.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts) Cynthia Tocci is the author of the young adult fantasy series, The Chronicles of Kiva She is also a screenwriter, film producer, theatrical producer, actress, and accountant.  Biography  Tocci is the fifth of eight children born to Valentino Tocci and Ruth Carnes Tocci. Born in Massachusetts, she was raised in Lexington, Massachusetts. After attending Northeastern University for one year, she transferred to University of New Hampshire where she received a bachelor's degree in Hotel Administration. In the 1980s, she began studying acting and appeared in countless theatrical productions throughout New England. She originated the role of Vincenza Vermicelli, the pregnant bridesmaid, in the interactive theatrical production of Joey and Maria's Comedy Italian Wedding. In 1994 she purchased, at federal auction, a function hall in Woburn, Massachusetts and opened the Deco Boston Dinner Theater. From 1994 through 1998, she produced over sixty different theatrical productions, including two interactive shows that she wrote herself: Polyester High 20th High School Reunion and The Wake of Maddy O'Malley. She also ran children's theater workshops. Tocci sold the business in 1999 and relocated to Los Angeles to pursue acting and film production. In 2000 she wrote and produced the independent murder mystery romance film Title to Murder, starring Maureen McCormick and Christopher Atkins. During production, Tocci was involved in a set accident when a large portable generator rolled and crushed her hand, leaving her in the hospital for several key days of shooting. The middle finger on her left hand is still damaged to this day. The film did not achieve the financial success that she'd hoped for. Disappointed with the creative constraints of filmmaking, she began writing novels. (\\"In a novel, no one tells you we don't have the budget to blow up a four-story building. Heck, blow up a twelve story building instead! It's only two more letters!\\") Her debut novel, Stone Voice Rising, the first in the series: The Chronicles of Kiva, published in the spring of 2009 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Children's Books under the pen name C.

The story revolves around Lilibit, a young girl who is destined to become the Stone Voice, (the one human who has the ability to communicate directly with the soul of the Earth) and Todd, a boy who will rise to be a powerful Stone Warrior. Evil forces, led by the demonic Deceiver Syxx, work to destroy Lilibit before she can achieve her destiny.

Nicole Lee (real name Sue Sharp) joined the group soon after as lead vocalist. The band originally performed under the title Snowhite, but later replaced the S with a Z. They independently released their three-song flexi disc which featured the song \\"Hellbent\\". This caught the attention of Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel. On the strength of the recording Znowhite landed a spot on volume three of the Metal Massacre compilation, which helped give them some exposure. Lineup changes and disbandment After Znowhite's initial success, Nicole, Ian, and Sparks decided to replace then bassist Amp Dawg. In 1985, Scott Schafer joined Znowhite taking over the bass duties. Four years of grueling back-to-back tours of America and Canada produced the independently released live album Live Suicide. Back in their hometown of Chicago the band started work on what would be the last Znowhite release, their magnum opus, Act of God. Toward the end of the recording sessions Nicole Lee made the decision to leave Znowhite. Act of God was released in 1988 through Roadrunner Records. An extensive American tour followed the album's release and featured Sentinel Beast vocalist Debbie Gunn (real name Debbie Gunderson) and drummer John Slattery - formerly of the band Tools Of Ignorance. Gunn left after the tours due to health issues. Fulton, Schafer, and Slattery went on to form Cyclone Temple When Cyclone Temple disbanded Fulton, Schafer, and Fulton's brother, former Znowhite drummer Tony Heath, formed a new group named Rebels Without Applause. Gunn went on to sing for the group Ice Age and, later, to reform Sentinel Beast.

Vector algebra uses all dimensions and signatures, as does geometric algebra, notably 3+1 spacetime as well as 2 dimensions.  Basic concepts and operations  Geometric algebra (GA) is an extension or completion of vector algebra (VA). The reader is herein assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts and operations of VA and this article will mainly concern itself with operations in \\\\mathcal G_{3} the GA of 3D space (nor is this article intended to be mathematically rigorous). In GA, vectors are not normally written boldface as the meaning is usually clear from the context. The fundamental difference is that GA provides a new product of vectors called the \\"geometric product\\". Elements of GA are graded multivectors, scalars are grade 0, usual vectors are grade 1, bivectors are grade 2 and the highest grade (3 in the 3D case) is traditionally called the pseudoscalar and designated I. The ungeneralized 3D vector form of the geometric product is: :ab=a \\\\cdot b + a \\\\wedge b that is the sum of the usual dot (inner) product and the outer (exterior) product (this last is closely related to the cross product and will be explained below). In VA, entities such as pseudovectors and pseudoscalars need to be bolted on, whereas in GA the equivalent bivector and pseudovector respectively exist naturally as subspaces of the algebra. For example, applying vector calculus in 2 dimensions, such as to compute torque or curl, requires adding an artificial 3rd dimension and extending the vector field to be constant in that dimension, or alternately considering these to be scalars. The torque or curl is then a normal vector field in this 3rd dimension. By contrast, geometric algebra in 2 dimensions defines these as a pseudoscalar field (a bivector), without requiring a 3rd dimension. Similarly, the scalar triple product is ad hoc, and can instead be expressed uniformly using the exterior product and the geometric product.  Translations between formalisms  Here are some comparisons between standard {\\\\mathbb R}^3 vector relations and their corresponding exterior product and geometric product equivalents. All the exterior and geometric product equivalents here are good for more than three dimensions, and some also for two. In two dimensions the cross product is undefined even if what it describes (like torque) is perfectly well defined in a plane without introducing an arbitrary normal vector outside of the space. Many of these relationships only require the introduction of the exterior product to generalize, but since that may not be familiar to somebody with only a background in vector algebra and calculus, some examples are given.  Cross and exterior products  The cross product in relation to the exterior product. In red are the orthogonal unit vector, and the \\"parallel\\" unit bivector. \\\\mathbf u \\\\times \\\\mathbf v is perpendicular to the plane containing \\\\mathbf u and \\\\mathbf v. \\\\mathbf u \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf v is an oriented representation of the same plane. We have the pseudoscalar I = e_{1}e_{2}e_{3} (right handed orthonormal frame) and so : e_{1}I = Ie_{1}= e_{2}e_{3} returns a bivector and : I (e_{2} \\\\wedge e_{3}) = Ie_2e_3 = -e_1 returns a vector perpendicular to the e_{2} \\\\wedge e_{3} plane. This yields a convenient definition for the cross product of traditional vector algebra: :{u}\\\\times{v} = -I({u}\\\\wedge{v}) (this is antisymmetric). Relevant is the distinction between axial and polar vectors in vector algebra, which is natural in geometric algebra as the distinction between vectors and bivectors (elements of grade two). The i here is a unit pseudoscalar of Euclidean 3-space, which establishes a duality between the vectors and the bivectors, and is named so because of the expected property :I^2 = (e_1 e_2 e_3)^2 = e_1 e_2 e_3 e_1 e_2 e_3 = - e_1 e_2 e_1 e_3 e_2 e_3 = e_1 e_1 e_2 e_3 e_2 e_3 = - e_3 e_2 e_2 e_3 = -1 The equivalence of the \\\\mathbb{R}^3 cross product and the exterior product expression above can be confirmed by direct multiplication of -I = - {e_1} {e_2} {e_3} with a determinant expansion of the exterior product : u \\\\wedge v = \\\\sum_{1\\\\leq i See also Cross product as an exterior product. Essentially, the geometric product of a bivector and the pseudoscalar of Euclidean 3-space provides a method of calculation of the Hodge dual.  Cross and commutator products  The pseudovector/bivector subalgebra of the geometric algebra of Euclidean 3-dimensional space form a 3-dimensional vector space themselves. Let the standard unit pseudovectors/bivectors of the subalgebra be \\\\mathbf{i} = \\\\mathbf{e_2} \\\\mathbf{e_3}, \\\\mathbf{j} = \\\\mathbf{e_1} \\\\mathbf{e_3}, and \\\\mathbf{k} = \\\\mathbf{e_1} \\\\mathbf{e_2}, and the anti-commutative commutator product be defined as A \\\\times B = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(AB - BA), where AB is the geometric product. The commutator product is distributive over addition and linear, as the geometric product is distributive over addition and linear.

As the pseudovectors/bivectors form a vector space, each pseudovector/bivector can be defined as the sum of three orthogonal components parallel to the standard basis pseudovectors/bivectors: :\\\\mathbf{A} = (A_1 \\\\mathbf{i} + A_2 \\\\mathbf{j} + A_3 \\\\mathbf{k}) :\\\\mathbf{B} = (B_1 \\\\mathbf{i} + B_2 \\\\mathbf{j} + B_3 \\\\mathbf{k}) Their commutator product \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} can be expanded using its distributive property: : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = (A_1 \\\\mathbf{i} + A_2 \\\\mathbf{j} + A_3 \\\\mathbf{k}) \\\\times (B_1 \\\\mathbf{i} + B_2 \\\\mathbf{j} + B_3 \\\\mathbf{k}) ::::= A_1 B_1 \\\\mathbf{i} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{i} + A_1 B_2 \\\\mathbf{i} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{j} + A_1 B_3 \\\\mathbf{i} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{k} + A_2 B_1 \\\\mathbf{j} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{i} + A_2 B_2 \\\\mathbf{j} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{j} + A_2 B_3 \\\\mathbf{j} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{k} + A_3 B_1 \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{i} + A_3 B_2 \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{j} + A_3 B_3 \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{k} ::::= A_1 B_2 \\\\mathbf{k} - A_1 B_3 \\\\mathbf{j} - A_2 B_1 \\\\mathbf{k} + A_2 B_3 \\\\mathbf{i} + A_3 B_1 \\\\mathbf{j} - A_3 B_2 \\\\mathbf{i} = (A_2 B_3 - A_3 B_2) \\\\mathbf{i} + (A_3 B_1 - A_1 B_3) \\\\mathbf{j} + (A_1 B_2 - A_2 B_1) \\\\mathbf{k} which is precisely the cross product in vector algebra for pseudovectors.  Norm of a vector  Ordinarily: : {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf u \\\\Vert}^2 = \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u Making use of the geometric product and the fact that the exterior product of a vector with itself is zero: : \\\\mathbf u \\\\, \\\\mathbf u = {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf u \\\\Vert}^2 = {\\\\mathbf u}^2 = \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u + \\\\mathbf u \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf u = \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u  Lagrange identity  In three dimensions the product of two vector lengths can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross products : {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\Vert}^2 {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\Vert}^2 = ({\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}})^2 + {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\Vert}^2 The corresponding generalization expressed using the geometric product is : {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\Vert}^2 {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\Vert}^2 = ({\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}})^2 - (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{v})^2 This follows from expanding the geometric product of a pair of vectors with its reverse : (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\mathbf{v})(\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\mathbf{u}) = ({\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}} + {\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{v}}) ({\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}} - {\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{v}})  Determinant expansion of cross and wedge products  : \\\\mathbf u \\\\times \\\\mathbf v = \\\\sum_{i : \\\\mathbf u \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf v = \\\\sum_{i Linear algebra texts will often use the determinant for the solution of linear systems by Cramer's rule or for and matrix inversion. An alternative treatment is to axiomatically introduce the wedge product, and then demonstrate that this can be used directly to solve linear systems. This is shown below, and does not require sophisticated math skills to understand. It is then possible to define determinants as nothing more than the coefficients of the wedge product in terms of \\"unit k-vectors\\" ({\\\\mathbf e}_i \\\\wedge {\\\\mathbf e}_j terms) expansions as above. :A one-by-one determinant is the coefficient of \\\\mathbf{e}_1 for an \\\\mathbb R^1 1-vector. :A two-by-two determinant is the coefficient of \\\\mathbf{e}_1 \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_2 for an \\\\mathbb R^2 bivector :A three-by-three determinant is the coefficient of \\\\mathbf{e}_1 \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_2 \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_3 for an \\\\mathbb R^3 trivector :... When linear system solution is introduced via the wedge product, Cramer's rule follows as a side-effect, and there is no need to lead up to the end results with definitions of minors, matrices, matrix invertibility, adjoints, cofactors, Laplace expansions, theorems on determinant multiplication and row column exchanges, and so forth.  Matrix Related Matrix inversion (Cramer's rule) and determinants can be naturally expressed in terms of the wedge product. The use of the wedge product in the solution of linear equations can be quite useful for various geometric product calculations. Traditionally, instead of using the wedge product, Cramer's rule is usually presented as a generic algorithm that can be used to solve linear equations of the form A x = b (or equivalently to invert a matrix). Namely : x = \\\\frac{1}{|A|}\\\\operatorname{adj}( A) b . This is a useful theoretic result. For numerical problems row reduction with pivots and other methods are more stable and efficient. When the wedge product is coupled with the Clifford product and put into a natural geometric context, the fact that the determinants are used in the expression of {\\\\mathbb R}^N parallelogram area and parallelepiped volumes (and higher-dimensional generalizations thereof) also comes as a nice side-effect. As is also shown below, results such as Cramer's rule also follow directly from the wedge product's selection of non- identical elements. The end result is then simple enough that it could be derived easily if required instead of having to remember or look up a rule. Two variables example : \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} = a x + b y = c . Pre- and post-multiplying by a and b, : ( a x + b y ) \\\\wedge b = ( a \\\\wedge b) x = c \\\\wedge b : a \\\\wedge ( a x + b y ) = ( a \\\\wedge b) y = a \\\\wedge c Provided a \\\\wedge b eq 0 the solution is :\\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\frac{1}{ a \\\\wedge b} \\\\begin{bmatrix} c \\\\wedge b \\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\wedge c\\\\end{bmatrix} . For a, b \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^2, this is Cramer's rule since the {e}_1 \\\\wedge {e}_2 factors of the wedge products : u \\\\wedge v = \\\\begin{vmatrix}u_1 & u_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_1 & v_2 \\\\end{vmatrix} {e}_1 \\\\wedge {e}_2 divide out. Similarly, for three, or N variables, the same ideas hold : \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\\\\\\\\\ z \\\\end{bmatrix} = d : \\\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\\\\\\\\\ z\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\frac{1}{ a \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge c} \\\\begin{bmatrix} d \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge c \\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\wedge d \\\\wedge c \\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge d \\\\end{bmatrix} Again, for the three variable three equation case this is Cramer's rule since the {e}_1 \\\\wedge {e}_2 \\\\wedge {e}_3 factors of all the wedge products divide out, leaving the familiar determinants. A numeric example with three equations and two unknowns: In case there are more equations than variables and the equations have a solution, then each of the k-vector quotients will be scalars. To illustrate here is the solution of a simple example with three equations and two unknowns. : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} x + \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} y = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{bmatrix} The right wedge product with (1, 1, 1) solves for x : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\wedge \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} x = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\wedge \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} and a left wedge product with (1, 1, 0) solves for y : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\wedge \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} y = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\wedge \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Observe that both of these equations have the same factor, so one can compute this only once (if this was zero it would indicate the system of equations has no solution). Collection of results for x and y yields a Cramer's rule-like form: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\frac{1}{(1, 1, 0) \\\\wedge (1, 1, 1)} \\\\begin{bmatrix} (1, 1, 2) \\\\wedge (1, 1, 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (1, 1, 0) \\\\wedge (1, 1, 2) \\\\end{bmatrix}. Writing {e} _i \\\\wedge {e} _j = {e} _{ij}, we have the end result: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\frac{1}{{e}_{13} + {e}_{23}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} {-{e}_{13} - {e}_{23}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {2{e}_{13} +2{e}_{23}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{bmatrix}.  Equation of a plane  For the plane of all points {\\\\mathbf r} through the plane passing through three independent points {\\\\mathbf r}_0, {\\\\mathbf r}_1, and {\\\\mathbf r}_2, the normal form of the equation is :(({\\\\mathbf r}_2 - {\\\\mathbf r}_0) \\\\times ({\\\\mathbf r}_1 - {\\\\mathbf r}_0)) \\\\cdot ({\\\\mathbf r} - {\\\\mathbf r}_0) = 0. The equivalent wedge product equation is :({\\\\mathbf r}_2 - {\\\\mathbf r}_0) \\\\wedge ({\\\\mathbf r}_1 - {\\\\mathbf r}_0) \\\\wedge ({\\\\mathbf r} - {\\\\mathbf r}_0) = 0.  Projection and rejection  Using the Gram–Schmidt process a single vector can be decomposed into two components with respect to a reference vector, namely the projection onto a unit vector in a reference direction, and the difference between the vector and that projection. With, \\\\hat{u} = u / {\\\\Vert u \\\\Vert}, the projection of v onto \\\\hat{u} is : \\\\mathrm{Proj}_{{\\\\hat{u}}}\\\\,{v} = \\\\hat{u} ( \\\\hat{u} \\\\cdot v) Orthogonal to that vector is the difference, designated the rejection, : v - \\\\hat{u} ( \\\\hat{u} \\\\cdot v) = \\\\frac{1}{{\\\\Vert u \\\\Vert}^2} ( {\\\\Vert u \\\\Vert}^2 v - u ( u \\\\cdot v)) The rejection can be expressed as a single geometric algebraic product in a few different ways : \\\\frac{ u }{{ u}^2} ( u v - u \\\\cdot v) = \\\\frac{1}{ u} ( u \\\\wedge v ) = \\\\hat{u} ( \\\\hat{u} \\\\wedge v ) = ( v \\\\wedge \\\\hat{u} ) \\\\hat{u} The similarity in form between the projection and the rejection is notable. The sum of these recovers the original vector : v = \\\\hat{u} ( \\\\hat{u} \\\\cdot v) + \\\\hat{u} ( \\\\hat{u} \\\\wedge v ) Here the projection is in its customary vector form. An alternate formulation is possible that puts the projection in a form that differs from the usual vector formulation : v = \\\\frac{1}{ u} ( {u} \\\\cdot v) + \\\\frac{1}{ u} ( {u} \\\\wedge v ) = ( {v} \\\\cdot u) \\\\frac{1}{ u} + ( v \\\\wedge u ) \\\\frac{1}{ u} Working backwards from the end result, it can be observed that this orthogonal decomposition result can in fact follow more directly from the definition of the geometric product itself. : v = \\\\hat{u} \\\\hat{u} v = \\\\hat{u} ( \\\\hat{u} \\\\cdot v + \\\\hat{u} \\\\wedge v ) With this approach, the original geometrical consideration is not necessarily obvious, but it is a much quicker way to get at the same algebraic result. However, the hint that one can work backwards, coupled with the knowledge that the wedge product can be used to solve sets of linear equations (see: ), the problem of orthogonal decomposition can be posed directly, Let v = a u + x, where u \\\\cdot x = 0. To discard the portions of v that are colinear with u, take the exterior product : u \\\\wedge v = u \\\\wedge (a u + x) = u \\\\wedge x Here the geometric product can be employed : u \\\\wedge v = u \\\\wedge x = u x - u \\\\cdot x = u x Because the geometric product is invertible, this can be solved for x: : x = \\\\frac{1}{u}( u \\\\wedge v ) . The same techniques can be applied to similar problems, such as calculation of the component of a vector in a plane and perpendicular to the plane. For three dimensions the projective and rejective components of a vector with respect to an arbitrary non-zero unit vector, can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross product :\\\\mathbf v = (\\\\mathbf v \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u})\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u} + \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u} \\\\times (\\\\mathbf v \\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u}) . For the general case the same result can be written in terms of the dot and wedge product and the geometric product of that and the unit vector :\\\\mathbf v = (\\\\mathbf v \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u})\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u} + (\\\\mathbf v \\\\wedge \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u}) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf u}. It's also worthwhile to point out that this result can also be expressed using right or left vector division as defined by the geometric product: :\\\\mathbf v = (\\\\mathbf v \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf u} + (\\\\mathbf v \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf u) \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf u} :\\\\mathbf v = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf u}(\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf v) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf u}(\\\\mathbf u \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf v) . Like vector projection and rejection, higher-dimensional analogs of that calculation are also possible using the geometric product. As an example, one can calculate the component of a vector perpendicular to a plane and the projection of that vector onto the plane. Let w = a u + b v + x , where u \\\\cdot x = v \\\\cdot x = 0. As above, to discard the portions of w that are colinear with u or v, take the wedge product : w \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v = (a u + b v + x) \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v = x \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v . Having done this calculation with a vector projection, one can guess that this quantity equals x ( u \\\\wedge v ). One can also guess there is a vector and bivector dot product like quantity such that the allows the calculation of the component of a vector that is in the \\"direction of a plane\\". Both of these guesses are correct, and validating these facts is worthwhile. However, skipping ahead slightly, this to-be-proven fact allows for a nice closed form solution of the vector component outside of the plane: : x = ( w \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v)\\\\frac{1}{ u \\\\wedge v} = \\\\frac{1}{ u \\\\wedge v}( u \\\\wedge v \\\\wedge w). Notice the similarities between this planar rejection result and the vector rejection result. To calculate the component of a vector outside of a plane we take the volume spanned by three vectors (trivector) and \\"divide out\\" the plane. Independent of any use of the geometric product it can be shown that this rejection in terms of the standard basis is : x = \\\\frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \\\\sum_{i where :(A_{u,v})^2 = \\\\sum_{i is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by u, and v. The (squared) magnitude of x is :{\\\\Vert x \\\\Vert}^2 = x \\\\cdot w = \\\\frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \\\\sum_{i Thus, the (squared) volume of the parallelopiped (base area times perpendicular height) is : \\\\sum_{i Note the similarity in form to the w, u, v trivector itself : \\\\sum_{i which, if you take the set of {e}_i \\\\wedge {e}_j \\\\wedge {e}_k as a basis for the trivector space, suggests this is the natural way to define the measure of a trivector. Loosely speaking, the measure of a vector is a length, the measure of a bivector is an area, and the measure of a trivector is a volume. If a vector is factored directly into projective and rejective terms using the geometric product v = \\\\frac{1}{u}( u \\\\cdot v + u \\\\wedge v), then it is not necessarily obvious that the rejection term, a product of vector and bivector is even a vector. Expansion of the vector bivector product in terms of the standard basis vectors has the following form :Let r = \\\\frac{1}{ u} ( u \\\\wedge v ) = \\\\frac{ u}{ u^2} ( u \\\\wedge v ) = \\\\frac{1}{{\\\\Vert u \\\\Vert}^2} u ( u \\\\wedge v ) It can be shown that : r = \\\\frac{1}{{\\\\Vert{ u}\\\\Vert}^2} \\\\sum_{i (a result that can be shown more easily straight from r = v - \\\\hat{u} ( \\\\hat{u} \\\\cdot v)). The rejective term is perpendicular to u, since \\\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_i & u_j\\\\end{vmatrix} = 0 implies r \\\\cdot u = 0 . The magnitude of r is : {\\\\Vert r \\\\Vert}^2 = r \\\\cdot v = \\\\frac{1}{{\\\\Vert{u}\\\\Vert}^2} \\\\sum_{i So, the quantity : {\\\\Vert r \\\\Vert}^2 {\\\\Vert{ u}\\\\Vert}^2 = \\\\sum_{i is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by u and v. It is also noteworthy that the bivector can be expressed as : u \\\\wedge v = \\\\sum_{i Thus is it natural, if one considers each term e_i \\\\wedge e_j as a basis vector of the bivector space, to define the (squared) \\"length\\" of that bivector as the (squared) area. Going back to the geometric product expression for the length of the rejection \\\\frac{1}{u} ( u \\\\wedge v ) we see that the length of the quotient, a vector, is in this case is the \\"length\\" of the bivector divided by the length of the divisor. This may not be a general result for the length of the product of two k-vectors, however it is a result that may help build some intuition about the significance of the algebraic operations. Namely, :When a vector is divided out of the plane (parallelogram span) formed from it and another vector, what remains is the perpendicular component of the remaining vector, and its length is the planar area divided by the length of the vector that was divided out.  Area of the parallelogram defined by u and v  If A is the area of the parallelogram defined by u and v, then : A^2 = {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf u \\\\times \\\\mathbf v \\\\Vert}^2 = \\\\sum_{i and :A^2 = -(\\\\mathbf u \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf v)^2 = \\\\sum_{i Note that this squared bivector is a geometric multiplication; this computation can alternatively be stated as the Gram determinant of the two vectors.  Angle between two vectors  :({\\\\sin \\\\theta})^2 = \\\\frac{{\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf u \\\\times \\\\mathbf v \\\\Vert}^2}{{\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf u \\\\Vert}^2 {\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf v \\\\Vert}^2} :({\\\\sin \\\\theta})^2 = -\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf u \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf v)^2}{{ \\\\mathbf u }^2 { \\\\mathbf v }^2}  Volume of the parallelopiped formed by three vectors  In vector algebra, the volume of a parallelopiped is given by the square root of the squared norm of the scalar triple product: :V^2 = {\\\\Vert (\\\\mathbf u \\\\times \\\\mathbf v) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf w \\\\Vert}^2 = {\\\\begin{vmatrix} u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ w_1 & w_2 & w_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{vmatrix}}^2 V^2 = -(\\\\mathbf u \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf v \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf w)^2 = -\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i Product of a vector and a bivector In order to justify the normal to a plane result above, a general examination of the product of a vector and bivector is required. Namely, : w ( u \\\\wedge v ) = \\\\sum_{i,j This has two parts, the vector part where i=j or i=k, and the trivector parts where no indexes equal. After some index summation trickery, and grouping terms and so forth, this is : w ( u \\\\wedge v) = \\\\sum_{i The trivector term is w \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v. Expansion of ( u \\\\wedge v) w yields the same trivector term (it is the completely symmetric part), and the vector term is negated. Like the geometric product of two vectors, this geometric product can be grouped into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, one of which is a pure k-vector. In analogy the antisymmetric part of this product can be called a generalized dot product, and is roughly speaking the dot product of a \\"plane\\" (bivector), and a vector. The properties of this generalized dot product remain to be explored, but first here is a summary of the notation : w ( u \\\\wedge v) = w \\\\cdot ( u \\\\wedge v) + w \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v :( u \\\\wedge v) w = - w \\\\cdot ( u \\\\wedge v) + w \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v : w \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v = \\\\frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \\\\wedge v ) + ( u \\\\wedge v ) w) : w \\\\cdot ( u \\\\wedge v) = \\\\frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \\\\wedge v ) - ( u \\\\wedge v ) w) Let w = x + y, where x = a u + b v, and y \\\\cdot u = y \\\\cdot v = 0. Expressing w and the u \\\\wedge v, products in terms of these components is : w ( u \\\\wedge v ) = x ( u \\\\wedge v ) + y ( u \\\\wedge v ) = x \\\\cdot ( u \\\\wedge v) + y \\\\cdot ( u \\\\wedge v) + y \\\\wedge u \\\\wedge v With the conditions and definitions above, and some manipulation, it can be shown that the term y \\\\cdot ( u \\\\wedge v) = 0, which then justifies the previous solution of the normal to a plane problem. Since the vector term of the vector bivector product the name dot product is zero when the vector is perpendicular to the plane (bivector), and this vector, bivector \\"dot product\\" selects only the components that are in the plane, so in analogy to the vector-vector dot product this name itself is justified by more than the fact this is the non-wedge product term of the geometric vector- bivector product.  Derivative of a unit vector  It can be shown that a unit vector derivative can be expressed using the cross product : \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf r}{\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf r \\\\Vert}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{{\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf r \\\\Vert}^3}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf r \\\\times \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{dt}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\mathbf r = \\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf r} \\\\times \\\\frac{1} \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{dt}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf r} The equivalent geometric product generalization is : \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf r}{\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf r \\\\Vert}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{{\\\\Vert \\\\mathbf r \\\\Vert}^3}\\\\mathbf r \\\\left(\\\\mathbf r \\\\wedge \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{dt}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}\\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf r} \\\\wedge \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{dt}\\\\right) Thus this derivative is the component of \\\\frac{1}\\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{dt} in the direction perpendicular to \\\\mathbf r. In other words, this is \\\\frac{1}\\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{dt} minus the projection of that vector onto \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf r}. This intuitively makes sense (but a picture would help) since a unit vector is constrained to circular motion, and any change to a unit vector due to a change in its generating vector has to be in the direction of the rejection of \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf r} from \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf r}{dt}. That rejection has to be scaled by 1/|rto get the final result.

The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 Census was 1,838. History Trelawnyd is one of Flintshire's ancient parishes, originally part of Dyserth parish. It became a separate parish between 1254 and 1291, and included the townships of Gop, Graig, Pentreffyddion and Rhydlyfnwyd. The village was renamed Newmarket in 1710 by John Wynne who obtained a faculty from the Bishops Registry. Wynne had by then redeveloped much of the village, established several industries, a weekly market, and an annual fair, in an attempt to turn Newmarket into the area's market town. The plan failed as nearby Rhyl developed into the larger market town. The village was officially renamed Trelawnyd, meaning \\"Town full of wheat\\" in Welsh, in 1954. The nearby Gop Hill (\\"Y Gop\\" in Welsh) has a prehistoric cairn mound, claimed to be the biggest in Wales and the second largest in Britain, as well as a cave or rock shelter, discovered in 1886–87. Trelawnyd Male Voice Choir In March 1933, 35 villagers formed a choir (Côr Meibion Trelawnyd) to compete at the village Eisteddfod. Within a few months, it grew to 50 members, and has progressed to world renown with about 100 members in 2010. In 1957, under conductor Neville Owen, a local schoolmaster, they won the National championships which were held at Bala. In 1973, under conductor Dr. Goronwy Wynne, they again won the National choir championship at Ruthin.Trelawnyd Male Voice Choir - History References External links * Trelawnyd Male Voice Choir Category:Villages in Flintshire ","title":"Trelawnyd"},{"id":"26193468","text":"View of the castle in Monzón.

It publishes a journal, Multivariate Behavioral Research. History SMEP was founded in 1960 by Raymond Cattell and others as an organization of scientific researchers interested in applying complex multivariate quantitative methods to substantive problems in psychology. The two main functions of the society are to hold an annual meeting of scientific or quantitative psychology specialists and to publish a journal, Multivariate Behavioral Research. The first meeting of the Society was held in Chicago in the fall of 1961. Beginning in 1993, the meeting has been held annually. Membership The new members of SMEP are elected by existing members, and membership is considered to be honorific. To promote interaction among participants in the annual meeting, the membership is limited to 65 active members under the age of 65, as well as to emeritus members (active members aged 65 and older who attend the annual meeting regularly). The Bylaws of SMEP stipulate that there should be twice the number of nominees for membership as available slots.

E. van Vogt. Plot summary Beings from another dimension have sent a living plastic \\"robot\\" to Earth to find the \\"greatest mathematical mind in the Solar System,\\" and get that person to open a vault on Mars, containing one of the race of its creators. It is able to imitate any form of matter, and to tap the thoughts of the being it duplicates. The creature kills its way to one man, Jim Brender, who it believes is the man. The creature, in the form of another man, reveals that the Martian vault was built by the Ancient Martians, made up of an 'ultimate metal'. The vault is known as the \\"Tower of the Beast\\", located in a buried Martian city. It says that the key to opening it is 'factoring the ultimate prime number'. Brender does not believe the tale and the creature causes a stock market crash, bankrupting Brender to achieve its aim. Brender is forced by his circumstances to take a job as a space pilot. The creature accompanies him to Mars, but is found out. He shoots it and weakens it, allowing its masters to take control of it. They explain that the \\"Beast\\" imprisoned in the vault is actually a scientist of their kind, Kalorn, who discovered how to bridge their two spaces. They intend to use Kalorn's discovery to conquer all spaces. To do this, they need to open the lock, a time lock. They get Brender to solve the combination, which is both simple and complex. However, releasing the lock has catastrophic consequences for Kalorn: exposed to the different time flow of our universe (billions of times faster), Kalorn ages into dust when the vault is opened. The opening of the vault also destroys the robot. Brender returns to Earth again wealthy, the finder and thereby partial owner of the contents of the buried city, worth billions. Publication history After starting his writing career by writing for true- confession style pulp magazines, such as True Story, van Vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed: science fiction. He was inspired by the August 1938 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, which he picked up at a newsstand. The story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr. led him to write Vault of the Beast, which he submitted to that same magazine. \\"I read half of it standing there at the news-stand before I bought the issue and finished it. That brought me back into the fold with a vengeance. I still regard that as the best story Campbell ever wrote, and the best horror tale in science fiction.\\"Fantasy Review Volume 1 No. 4, Aug.-Sep. 1947 Vault of the Beast initially received a positive rejection letter from Astounding Science Fiction; however, after van Vogt's subsequent story, Black Destroyer, was accepted and promoted as the cover story, Vault of the Beast was published in 1940, and has since been published in several collections and anthologies,Bibliography: Vault of the Beast Isfdb such as Monsters, The Other Side of the Moon and Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 2 (1940).

In February 2014, the site was re-branded as Ici TOU.TV as part of a plan to unify CBC's French-language outlets around a single brand. In May 2018, it was announced that Bell Media, the National Film Board of Canada, TV5 Québec Canada, and V Media Group would contribute content to TOU.TV's premium Extra tier, as part of an effort to better compete with Netflix on the availability of Quebecois and French-language content. Other distributors such as Télé-Quebec later joined the partnership. Bell Media left the partnership after the company's rival service, Crave, expand into the French-language market.

The 2010 Claxton Shield finals series made use of the same structure as had been used in the 2009 season. The top three teams at the conclusion of the ten rounds of regular season games qualified. The second and third placed teams faced in each other in a best of three series hosted by the second placed team. The winner of that series then faced the first placed team for a best of three series. South Australia hosted the New South Wales Patriots at Norwood Oval, Adelaide for the semi-final series, while the Victoria Aces hosted the championship series at La Trobe University, Melbourne. In the finals, the home team and away team alternated during each of the series. As a result, South Australia was officially the away team for game two of its series against New South Wales, as was Victoria in game two of the championship series. South Australia came from behind in the semi-final series to win 2–1. New South Wales won game one 1–0 on the back of Timothy Auty's RBI-double, as well as Timothy Cox and Lee Ingram combining for a four- hit shutout. Despite being outhit 10–6, South Australia won game two 3–2. Unusually, the winning run was scored in the top of the ninth inning without a safe hit being recorded. Game three was won by South Australia 1–0, largely through the man of the match performance of Ryan Murphy; he pitched a complete game shutout, and scored the only run of the game on a solo home run to right field. Despite splitting their regular season games 3–3, Victoria swept South Australia in the championship series 2–0. Despite taking an early lead in game one, South Australia was unable to hold on after allowing six runners to reach base resulting in three runs scoring in the fourth inning. Victoria held its 5–3 lead for the rest of the game through the pitching of Russell Spear and finals MVP Matthew Blackmore. In game two, South Australia led for much of the game, but a costly error by Ben Wigmore in the sixth inning, hits from Andrew Russell, Paul Weichard, James Beresford and Matthew Lawman in the ninth, and a run-free pitching performance from Ross Hipke and Russell Spear in the final three innings allowed Victoria to come from behind two nights in a row to win 7–4, and claim the states' 22nd Claxton Shield title.  Bracket   Semi- final series   Game 1  The finals series started off with a pitcher's duel: both teams were held scoreless through the first six innings, with both New South Wales' Timothy Cox and South Australia's Paul Mildren holding their opposition to only three hits in that time. But in the seventh, Patrick Maat led off the inning for the Patriots with a base hit to centre field. He then advanced to second base on Andrew Graham's sacrifice bunt, and scored on Timothy Auty's double. Cox pitched 8 innings, giving up 4 hits, 3 walks, and striking out 9 batters to pick up the win. Lee Ingram came into the game for the ninth inning to close the game, picking up a strike out while retiring three hitters in a row to get the save.  Game 2  In another tight contest, South Australia snapped a streak of eight losing efforts in a row in finals games to New South Wales, winning 3–2. South Australia opened the scoring in the top of the fifth. Ben Wigmore and Dan Wilson hit back–to–back singles, Mathew Smith grounded out to advance both. With two out, Jason Pospishil errored on Scott Gladstone's hit to second base, allowing both runners to score. Pospshil helped the Patriots to recover immediately in the bottom of the inning, with a single to lead off the inning. He then scored on Mark Holland's double to cut the deficit in half. In the eighth inning, New South Wales evened the game, with David Kandilas's infield hit driving in Patrick Maat. In the ninth however, South Australia regained the lead without a hit: two walks and two hit by pitches allowed Stefan Welch to score.  Game 3  Like the first two games of the semi-final series, the third and deciding game was also decided by one run. Ryan Murphy was named man of the match, after pitching a two–hit shutout, and hitting a solo home run in the second inning to score the only run in the game. Prior to the game, Murphy had not started on the mound in any game in the season, and had only pitched one and a third innings in one prior appearance. Michael Lysaught almost tied the game in the third inning with a solo home run of his own. Only Dan Wilson's catch from over the fence in right field prevented it.  Championship series   Game 1  Baseball returned to La Trobe University for the Victoria Aces' home championship series, after having just the one game there during the regular season. Unlike the semi-final series, scoring started immediately in the championship series, with South Australia scoring in the top of the first inning: Jeremy Cresswell singled and then advanced to third when Stefan Welch reached on a throwing error by catcher Grant Karlsen. Michael Collins and Ryan Murphy each walked in consecutive plate appearances, advancing Cresswell to score the first run. Before the inning could be closed out, Welch scored on a wild pitch to extend South Australia's lead to two. Brad Harman opened the scoring for Victoria in the second inning, with a first pitch solo home run to halve the deficit. Victoria tied the game up at 2–2 through back to back doubles in the third, first from Brett Tamburrino and followed by Andrew Russell to drive Tamburrino in. South Australia briefly regained the lead in the top of the fourth inning: Ben Wigmore lead off the inning with a walk, advanced to second on Mathew Smith's single, and scored on Scott Gladstone's double. Gladstone's RBI-double was the final pitch for Adam Blackley, having scattered 4 hits over innings pitched, striking out 7 and allowing 3 runs, only 1 of which was earned. He was replaced by Matthew Blackmore, who pitched into the ninth inning, allowing only 1 hit and striking out 4 over 5 innings pitched. Neither starting pitcher pitched beyond the fourth inning, as South Australia's Paul Mildren was also replaced after innings, allowing 7 hits and 5 runs (4 earned), and striking out 3. Victoria regained the lead permanently in the bottom of the fourth, and in the process drove Mildren from the game. James Beresford led off the inning with a walk, advanced to third on Matthew Lawman's double and scored on Elliott Biddle's single. Scott Wearne reached second on a throwing error by second baseman Smith, which also allowed Lawman to score. Tamburrino received a walk, followed by Russell being hit by a pitch which forced Biddle to score. The hit batter resulted in Chris Lawson replacing Mildren on the mound. Like the other relievers in the game, Lawson did not allow a run to score over his innings pitched. The 5–3 score at the end of the fourth inning would be maintained for the rest of the game. Russell Spear entered the game in the ninth inning to close the game for Victoria, earning the save. Blackmore was credited with the win, while Mildren was charged with the loss for South Australia.  Game 2  The second game of the series started in even fashion: both sides were retired in order in the first inning, and each got runners into scoring position without actually scoring in the second. The games' first run came in the third inning, and for the fourth time in the 2010 postseason a run was driven in by a walk. Tristan McDonald led off the inning with a single to center field. He advanced to second on Brett Tamburrino's single to right field, to third when Andrew Russell was hit by a pitch, then scored when Paul Weichard drew a walk. South Australia tied the score again in the fourth inning. Ben Wigmore walked to lead off the inning, and advanced to second when Dan Wilson ground out to first base. Wigmore then scored on Mathew Smith's single. Victoria immediately regained the lead in the top of the fifth inning. Tamburrino singled, and then advanced to third on Russell's own base hit. Weichard hit a deep fly ball to center field, allowing Tamburrino to score on the sacrifice fly. However South Australia took the lead for the first time in the game in the bottom of the inning, when Shane Lindsay—pitching in relief of Adam Bright, who'd struck out 5 and allowed 5 hits, 1 walk and 1 run over 4 innings pitched—walked David Washington and Jeremy Cresswell, before giving up a home run to Michael Collins to take the score to 4–2. After the home run Lindsay, Ross Hipke and Russell Spear would combine to keep South Australia from scoring again in the game. That lead was halved in the sixth through an unearned run. Elliot Biddle got on through an infield hit, and then advanced to third when Ben Wigmore dropped a fly ball in center field off the bat of Hayden Dingle. This allowed Tristan McDonald to drive Wigmore in on a sacrifice fly. Richard Bartlett entered the game to pitch for South Australia in the seventh inning, but was unable to hold on to the one-run lead he was given, allowing the tying run to score in the eighth when he walked McDonald and gave up an RBI-double to Scott Wearne. James Beresford drove in the go- ahead run in the top of the ninth inning in the form of Paul Weichard after he and Andrew Russell hit back to back infield singles. Hayden Beard was brought in by South Australia to try to stop the flow of runs, but gave up a two run- double to Matthew Lawman to take Victoria to a 7–4 lead. Russell Spear entered the game for Victoria as closer for the second night in a row, and despite giving up two hits was able to keep South Australia scoreless to earn a second save.

It is native to western North America from Washington, and California, to northern Mexico. It is a spring wildflower in grassy meadows, woodlands, coastal sage scrub, and wetland-riparian habitats. Description It is an annual herb growing erect 20 to 70 centimeters in maximum height. It contains purple sap, the herbage edged with purple or rusty red and bleeding purple when crushed. It is hairy in texture, the hairs rough and sharp. The leaves are mostly located in a rosette around the base of the stem, with a few alternately arranged along the stem's length. The inflorescence is a series of tiny five-lobed white flowers each 3 to 9 millimeters wide. The fruit is a rounded nutlet with a pointed tip about 2 millimeters long and borne singly, in pairs or triplets which are solidly attached to each other. Deep roots are characteristic especially on drier soils. Distribution Plagiobothrys nothofulvus is native to parts of the Pacific Northwest. It ranges from northern California and into southern Washington. Populations have been reported as far south as Baja California, Mexico and north to the Columbia River Gorge. Habitat Grassy meadows, especially those along the coast, are the most common habitat for Plagiobothrys nothofulvus. It can also be found in woodlands, coastal sage scrub, and wetland-riparian habitats and are often associated with serpentine or plutonic soils. Other species that commonly grow in similar grassland habitats and are often associated with Plagiobothrys nothofulvus include Aster chilensis, Lotus angustissimus, Plantago lanceolata, Galium parisiense, Brodiaea terrestris, and other native herbs. Etymology The scientific name of the rusty popcorn flower, Plagiobothrys nothofulvus, describes some of its key characteristics. Plagiobothrys refers to a sideways pit formed by the position of the nutlet attachment scar. Nothofulvus comes from the words nothus, meaning bastard or false, and fulvus, meaning yellowish, as it had been at first been mistaken for Plagiobothrys fulvus, which had in turn been named for the dense tawny hairs on its calyx and pedicel. Ecology Plagiobothrys nothofulvus is food for many different animals. Deer, ground squirrels, and insects often forage on the plant. Turtles will also feed on the flowers in riparian zones. Black seed-harvesting ants will eat the seeds of popcorn flowers. Species of beetles will use the flower as a breeding platform. Butterflies, moths, and bees drink its nectar as they pollinate the flowers. Ctenuchid moths are frequently found on the flowers, the importance of their interactions is currently unknown. Reproduction The flowers of Plagiobothrys nothofulvus generally bloom from February – April. As in many other members of the family Boraginaceae, the flower consists of five petals and are bisexual with both male and female parts represented in the flower. Bees and butterflies are the main pollinators transferring the haploid microgametophyte, or pollen grain, to the pistil. The microgametophyte will then travel down the pistil to the ovule to fertilize the haploid macrogametophyte, or egg. Each pollen grain contains two sperm cells for double fertilization of the egg. One fertilization event forms a diploid zygote and the other fertilization event forms the endosperm of the seed. Conservation Plagiobothrys nothofulvus is a federally listed endangered species in Oregon. The major threat to Plagiobothry nothofulvus is habitat loss by the transformation of its historical range to agricultural land. The loss of seasonal wetlands by habitat degradation and changing climate as well as the introduction of invasive species also pose large threats to the rusty popcorn flower. Efforts to restore the population include establishing protected populations, saving seeds, providing education to land owners, and restoring natural habitats. References Brown, M. and Human, K.

He is best known for writing the comic strips The WarrumbunglersThe Warrumbunglers title is sometimes written with a hyphen (The Warrum-bunglers) but this is most likely a stylistic decision to fit the long title within one panel of the comic strip. and On The Rocks. Emerson was the son-in-law of cartoonist Eric Jolliffe. Background Emerson was born in Sydney, the son of Albert Emerson and his wife, Ruth (Booth), who had emigrated from Belfast. He had one brother, Alf. His father died from malaria, which he contracted whilst they were based in New Guinea. His mother remarried and had another son, Denis. He spent part of his youth working in central Queensland. After leaving school, Emerson experienced a wide range of jobs including greaser, surveyor's assistant, barman, stagehand, boilermaker's assistant and builder's labourer. He spent three years studying art at East Sydney Technical College before travelling to New Zealand, where his brother Alf had moved to. In New Zealand he worked in assorted jobs including as a freelance artist. On his return to Sydney, Emerson subsequently became a full- time artist. His began as a commercial artist and photograph retoucher in advertising, then went on to television animation before returning to advertising, where he remained until 1976. Cartoonist In May 1960 had a comic strip, Bush Folks, accepted by the Australian Woman's Mirror. In November 1960 the magazine was taken over by Australian Consolidated Press, following which it was merged with the Weekend. The two magazines had nothing in common and ended up being called Everybody's. The strip was dropped but Emerson continued to sell cartoons to the new magazine for several years before it folded late in 1967. In 1967 Emerson began drawing the outback comic strip The Warrumbunglers, originally for The Sunday Telegraph, where it was dropped in July 1969 only to re-appear in The Sun-Herald in December 1969. It was dropped again in 1971 and didn't re-appear until May 1977 as one of the replacement strips for Fatty Finn. The Warrumbunglers became Australia's second-longest running comic strip; Emerson completed his last strip shortly before his death. The Warrumbunglers featured numerous Australian animals, kangaroos, echidnas, bandicoots, goannas and koalas, as an anthropomorphic community. The strip's themes reflect mateship, tall tales and bush sayings. In February 1974 Sydney's The Sun published Emerson's, pseudo-colonial convict comic strip, On The Rocks, where it ran until 2001. The strip featured the exploits of Floyd Fingal, a transported con-man, Major Upheaval, a paymaster with the New South Wales Rum Corps, the bumbling Colonial Governor and his hopeless aide, De Camp. In August 1975 it was bought by Brisbane's Sunday Mail and the name of the strip was changed to Ball and Chain. The strip continued in The Sun-Herald until late April 1988. In 1986 Emerson was awarded the Stanley Award for best comic strip by the Australian Cartoonists' Association. Ginger Meggs Ginger Meggs is an iconic Australian comic strip. Following the deaths of its creator Jimmy Bancks in 1952 and his replacement Ron Vivian in 1973, Emerson was one of several artists who submitted drawings to take over the strip. The role, however, went to Lloyd Piper. When Piper died in 1984 Emerson again applied for the job and was appointed. As he already had two strips published in The Sun-Herald, he was asked to drop either The Warrumbunglers or On The Rocks in favour of Ginger Meggs. He declined, and the role was offered instead to James Kemsley. Personal In 1956 he married Margaret 'Meg' Jolliffe (the daughter of Eric Jolliffe), whom he met whilst studying at the East Sydney Technical College. In 1963 they had a daughter, Jane, who is a graphic artist. Meg died in 1997 and Emerson died on 12 February 2010. Anthologies *The Warrumbunglers *On The Rocks *The Warrumbunglers bushed!

The family was part of the Iranian oligarchy during the Pahlavi era and its members had significant roles in politics and diplomacy of Iran for more than seventy years. Originally from Tabriz, the family descends from Hajj Seyyed Hossein (died circa 1840) also known as Hossein Shah, a wealthy merchant. His sons Seid Mirza Ebrahim Khalil and Mirza Hasan had received traditional religious training, but were enough enlightened to send their children abroad to receive modern education. Returning to Iran, they became pioneers in the modernization of the country. Mostafa Adle, son of Ebrahim Khalil, drafted the first civil code, while his cousin Yahya Adle became the first to practice modern surgery. Habib Adle was notable for importing cutting edge medical technologies, including X-ray medical imaging and Ahmad-Hossein Adle played a pivotal role in the establishment of modern industrial agriculture. The family came into prominence after the Iranian constitutional revolution, when the old aristocratic families were losing their inherited positions and were being replaced by a new generation of technocrats. The family further consolidated its position by several marriages to the old affluent families, including Vali, Hedayat, Farzaneh, Mahdavi, Boushehri and Qajar families. The origin of the modern family name Adl or Adle is from the titles of nobility given to Iranian jurists at the end of the 19th century, that were related by family ties. Notably, these jurists included Hajj Mirza Hasan whose title was Adl-ol- molk (Justice of the Kingdom), Seid Mirza Ebrahim Khalil whose title was Rokn- ol-edaleh (Pillar of Justice), and Mirza Mostafa Khan Adle whose title was Mansoor-ol-saltaneh (the Victorious of the Empire).

It is situated in the central Dalmatian archipelago, 5 km south-west of the island of Vis. The grotto is one of the best known natural beauty spots on the Adriatic and a popular show cave because of the glowing blue light that appears at certain times of day.Radovan Radovinovič, The Croatian Adriatic, pg. 298, Naklada Naprijed, Zagreb (1999), The grotto Exit from the Blue Grotto. First described and painted by Baron Eugen von Ransonet, the cave was originally accessible only by diving as it had one natural entrance below the sea level. Based on his suggestion, an artificial entrance large enough for small boats was built in 1884. The natural entrance to the cave, located on its southern side, is said to resemble a vault on the ceiling of a grotto. It is through this submarine-like opening on the ceiling of the cave that sunlight gets in and creates an iridescent blue glowing effect all around the cave. As well, a stone bar, connecting two walls of the cave, is clearly visible just below the waterline, both in above-water photographs and in underwater photos. Depending on the season, the ideal moment to visit the cave is between 11 AM and 12 noon.Jeanne Oliver, Croatia, pg. 210, Lonely Planet (2007), Vesna Maric, Lonely Planet Croatia, pg. 242, Lonely Planet (2009), At this time of day the sunlight reflects through the water coming from the white floor of the cave and bathes the grotto in aquamarine light, while objects in the water appear to be silver.Steve Davey, Marc Schlossman, Unforgettable Islands to Escape to Before You Die, pg. 110, Firefly Books (2007), The Blue Grotto (Italian: Grotta Azzurra) on the island of Capri in Italy is also famous for this type of phenomenon. The cave was formed by the wave action of the sea, as sea water eroded the limestone rock of which the whole island of Biševo is composed. The cave itself is 24 meters long, 10–12 metres deep and up to 15 metres high, while the entrance to it measures 1.5 metres high and 2.5 metres wide. The cave receives more than 10,000 tourist visits every year, and tourist boats often include a visit to another similar cave on the island, the Zelena špilja (English: The Green Grotto), which is bigger in size and appears to be of an emerald-green tone due to a similar effect.

She graduated from The Dearborn School in 1897. She began to study music first with Frederick Bristol and later Enrica Clay Dillon. She also had coaching lessons with Swedish composer, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger in Stockholm, and French lyric tenor Edmond Clément in Paris. She married Gustaf Sundelius, a Swedish born businessman, in Boston in 1906.

In December 1915 she came to New York City for the first time to sing as a soloist in the world premiere of Marco Enrico Bossi's Jeanne d'Arc with the Oratorio Society of New York. The performance was attended by Giulio Gatti- Casazza, the General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who immediately approached her afterwards with an offer to join the roster of singers at the Met. She accepted, and made her opera debut at the \\"Old Met\\" on November 25, 1916 as the First Priestess in Christoph Willibald Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride with Melanie Kurt in the title role and Artur Bodanzky conducting. Sundelius remained committed to the Metropolitan Opera up through 1923, although she returned to the house periodically as a guest artist up through 1928.

After she left New York in 1925, she went to Europe where she was committed to the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm through 1927. She also toured Europe, performing in concerts and recitals. In 1929-1930 she sang with the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company and the Chicago Civic Opera. Later years She retired from the stage in the early 1930s, after which she taught for many years at the New England Conservatory. Among her notable pupils were Jean Cox, Mildred Miller, and Coretta Scott King. She died in Boston at the age of 74. Her voice is preserved on several recordings made on the Columbia, Vocalion and Edison record labels during the second decade of the 20th century.

It was the forerunner of another three identical aircraft (designated S.48, S.49, and S.50 by Shorts) delivered to the Royal Navy and Royal Flying Corps during 1912 and 1913. The Royal Naval Air Service was still operating the type when World War I broke out in 1914. Design and development The design was similarindeed, so similar that at least some sources such as Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War I (p.78) and Thetford's British Naval Aircraft Since 1912 (p.455) treat the S.36 and S.45 types as one and the same. to that of the Short S.36, a sporting biplane built for Frank McCleanBruce 1956, p.922. which he lent to the Navy Flying School, Eastchurch. Cdr Charles Rumney Samson and Capt Eugene Gerrard test-flew the aircraft early in 1912. The pleasing performance of the S.36 led to an order by the Admiralty for two aircraft of similar configuration, but differed in the engine fitted. in March that year.Barnes & James 1989, p.80 Shorts delivered these as the S.41 and the S.45. The S.45 was an unequal-span two-bay biplane with a fuselage of square-cross section with the two seats in tandem in open cockpits . The wire-braced wings were unstaggered, and the fuselage was mounted partway between them. Ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing. The tail was cruciform in shape and the undercarriage was designed to be interchangeable to allow the S.45 to be flown as a seaplane or landplane. The machine was powered by a single rotary engine in the nose, turning a two-blade propeller. In seaplane configuration, the undercarriage consisted of a single broad pontoon mounted beneath the fuselage, with airbags on short struts under each wing. A third airbag was later fitted under the tail to keep it out of the water while the aircraft was under tow. Operational history The S.45 flew for the first time on 24 May 1912 as a landplane with Lt Spencer Grey at the controls, and was accepted for Navy service with the serial number T.5 (\\"T\\" signifying \\"tractor\\"). Together with the S.41, the aircraft participated in the Naval Review at Portsmouth in July. It was soon joined in service by the S.48 (serial 413), which Capt Gerrard delivered to the Central Flying School at Upavon on 10 October.Barnes & James 1989, pp.86–87 Although evaluated by Capt John Salmond as underpowered, it flew regularly until damaged beyond repair in a landing accident on 3 December when it stalled on approach. Meanwhile, the S.45 underwent considerable modification, including a new engine cowling, a built-up coaming around the cockpits, revised ailerons, and upper wings of greater span. The wing extensions were braced with a kingpost and wires.Bruce 1956, p.923. Its serial was changed from \\"T.5\\" to simply \\"5\\" when army and navy aircraft serials were merged into one system in late 1912. In 1913, the S.45 was stationed at Carlingnose, near Rosyth, where it suffered a landing accident and capsized on 4 October. At the start of 1913, the Central Flying School received two further examples of the type: Capt Gerrard delivered the S.50 (serial 424) on 17 February and the S.49 (serial 423) on 22 February. Not long after, these aircraft disappeared from the records when their serial numbers were reassigned to two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.8s.Barnes & James (1989, p. 86–87) describes these reassignments as examples of an accounting trick perpetrated by the War Office. The ruse was intended to disguise how few serviceable aircraft were actually available to the Royal Flying Corps when Colonel Seely, Secretary of State for War, was questioned on this topic by his political opponents in parliament. Eventually, stripped of their engines and identities, the War Office declared the two airframes to be surplus to requirements, and transferred them to the Admiralty in August 1914. In Royal Naval Air Service hands, the aircraft were re-engined with 100-hp (75-kW) Clerget rotary engines and assigned serial numbers 1268 and 1279. The RNAS operated them at the Navy Flying School and they remained in service at the outbreak of World War I.

It is one of the monastery's two principal halls and overlooks the northwest end of the courtyard. In addition to being one of the largest Buddhist halls in South Korea, Gakhwangjeon Hall is registered as National Treasure 67 by the Cultural Heritage Administration. The largest edifice of Hwaeomsa from the Unified Silla period until the mid- Joseon Dynasty was Jangnyukjeon Hall, a multi-story wooden structure whose inner stone walls were inscribed with the Flower Garland Sutra. Jangnyukjeon Hall was destroyed in 1593 when the temple was burned to the ground by the Japanese during the Imjin War. The restoration of Hwaeomsa was begun in 1630 by the monk Byeogam Gakseong but at that time the cost of rebuilding Jangnyukjeon Hall was beyond the temple's means. From 1699 to 1702 the monk Gyepa Seongneung, one of Gakseong's disciples, oversaw the reconstruction of the hall, which was subsequently renamed Gakhwangjeon Hall. The majority of the funding was contributed by Lady Hwagyeong, a consort of King Sukjong, and several noblemen holding senior positions in the government bureaucracy. Gakhwangjeon Hall was one of the most important feats of mid-Joseon Buddhist architecture. Constructed from wood onto a stone base, the hall is two stories in height and measures seven bays across. It underwent a major renovation in the Japanese colonial period, during which the hall was completely disassembled and then rebuilt. The hall's inner sanctum contains seven altar statues executed in 1703 by the influential sculptor Saengnan. They include the seated Buddha triad of Sakyamuni, Amitābha and Prabhutaratna, representing the Buddhas of the Three Periods, attended by standing Bodhisattva statues of Avalokiteśvara, Samantabhadra, Manjusri and Ksitigarbha. Altar paintings of the three Buddhas were later completed in 1860, although one mistakenly depicts Bhaisajyaguru instead of Prabhutaratna. History Background During the Unified Silla period Hwaeomsa was a leading Buddhist monastery of the Flower Garland school.Jeon, Kim and So 2000, p.29 Its principle edifice was Jangnyukjeon Hall, a multi-story wooden structure whose inner sanctum had stone plates engraved with the entire Flower Garland Sutra attached to the walls.Lee 1997, pp.119-120 This building was lost however when Japanese soldiers burned Hwaeomsa to the ground in 1593 during the Imjin War.Sin 2007, p.92 The temple was restored from 1630 to 1636 by the monk Byeogam Gakseong (1575-1660), who was also responsible for rebuilding some of the most important monasteries of the Joseon Dynasty.Lee 1997, pp.81-90 Gakseong was the senior-most figure in the Righteous Monk Army and had close ties with the Joseon throne, both of which were assumed by successive generations of his disciples.Lee 1997, p.99 At Hwaeomsa he erected Daeungjeon Hall and several other essential structures but the poor state of the post-war economy made the cost of rebuilding Jangnyukjeon Hall prohibitive.Jeon, Kim and So 2000, pp.70-71 Records from Hwaeomsa and other monks nevertheless tell that the reconstruction of Jangnyukjeon Hall was Gakseong's dying wish. His cause was initially taken up by a disciple, the eminent monk and man of letters Baegam Seongchong (1631-1700). After a spell as abbot of Yungmusa Seongchong appears to have moved to Hwaeomsa sometime in the 1690sLee 1997, pp.98-99 and wrote An Appeal for Alms to Sculpt Icons for and Rebuild Jangnyukjeon Hall of Hwaeomsa, Gurye求禮華嚴寺重建丈六殿兼造像勸善文 to help solicit contributions.Sin 2009, pp.102-103 He brought along his student of three years, the monk Gyepa Seongneung (d.1745), whom Seongchong placed in charge of rebuilding the hall. Little has survived about Seongneung's early life. It is recorded in A Chronicle of the Great Temple Hwaeomsa of Jirisan, Honam, Haedong (henceforth Hwaeomsa Chronicle),海東湖南地異山大華嚴寺事蹟 a history of the temple compiled by Jeong Byeongheon (1891-1969), that Seongneung hailed from Yecheon.Like Gakseong, Seongneung was a great builder, acquiring the title Enlightening Hero of Adorning the Buddha Land (莊嚴佛國之開士). Following Hwaeomsa, he led the construction of the stupa at Tongdosa (1705) and the fortification of Bukhansanseong (1711). He also appears to have been involved in the repair of Gwanchoksa at Nonsan (1735), and Daeungjeon Hall at Ssanggyesa in Eunjin (1738), where he exercised his formidable talents at soliciting contributions. He returned to Hwaeomsa in 1745 and died in November of that year after publishing Chronicles of Bukhan Fortress (北漢誌). See Lee 1997, pp.98-99 Construction Seongneung began construction work in 1699,Lee 1997 p.97 although Seongchong himself died in 1700 before it could be completed.Lee 1997, p.91 The reconstruction was made possible by a combination of the temple's influence, state patronage and royal interest. The principle patrons were Lady Hwagyeong (1670-1718), a royal consort to King Sukjong (r. 1674-1720), and her son Prince Yeoning, who was still but a young child.Choi 1994, pp.54-56 Records indicate that several notable members of the government were also contributors. These were: Choi Seokjeong (1646-1715), the senior-most member of the bureaucracy; Lee Sebaek (1635-1703), the Second State Councilor; Sin Wan (1646-1707), a Supreme Councilor of the State Council; Oh Doil (1645-1703), the Minister of War; Jo Sangu (b. 1640), a junior second grade official in the ministry of personnel; a royal tutor to the crown prince surnamed Hong; a senior third grade official in the ministry of taxation named Hong Suju (1669-1731); Chae Paengyun (1669-1731), a royal scribe; and Lee Don (1642-1713), a junior second grade official in the ministry of rites.Lee 1997, p.94 In light of the fact that the typical benefactors of Buddhist institutions during this period were poor farmers and women their patronage proved essential, and yet odd given that by the late 17th century the Old Doctrine faction had regained political dominance at court, fostering a renewed ostracism of Buddhism. Professor Lee Kang-geun argues that their support was part of the struggle over the royal succession. Since his birth, the Old Doctrine faction had secretly been supporting Yeoning as a possible rival to the son of Jang Okjeong, the royal consort who had for a time supplanted Queen Inhyeon (1667-1701). Indeed, the motives of Hwagyeong, who made the donation on behalf of her son, now appear to have been more political than religious; according to Choi Wansu it was likely an attempt to extend her influence and that of her supporters in the Jeolla region. Alternatively, Lee suggests that it might have been Inhyeon herself who was supporting the reconstruction on behalf of Hwagyeong and her son as an act of invocation for their future at court.The prince's name was incorrectly spelled on the sangnyangmun as Yeonin (延礽) instead of Yeoning (延礽). The error may have come about because his name and that of his mother appear to have been added to the document by monks at Hwaeomsa after it had already been written. See Choi 1994, p.55 Ultimately, the Old Doctrine faction would succeed in having Yeoning made crown prince in 1721, and he would later ascend the throne and rule as King Yeongjo (r.1724-1776). The \\"ridge beam scroll\\" (sangnyangmun),求禮華嚴寺丈六殿重建上樑文 Lee 1997, pp.89-90 a document which describes the circumstances of a major building's construction, was penned by Chae Paengyun and placed into the ridge beam during a ceremony in 1701. According to this document the hall was designed by a crew of 45 draftsmen led by master builder Neungo, a monk from the temple of Cheongwansa, in Jangheung. The assistant master builders were the monks Gakhe, who hailed from some unspecified temple on Mount Gyerongsan, and Wolwon, from Hongguksa, in Yeosu. These were some of the leading Buddhist architects of the southern provinces. A further contingent of about 3000 monks from the Righteous Monk Army was mobilized from the surrounding temples in Jeollanam-do and Gyeongsangnam-do as manual labor, while about 150 monks from Hwaeomsa also had some direct or indirect involvement in the work.Lee 1997 pp.95-97 The eminent monk Muyong Suyeon (1651-1719), a disciple of Seongchong, also appears to have played a significant part in the hall's construction.Sin 2009, pp.109-112Lee 1997 p.99At about the same time Muyong Suyeon was involved in the construction of a reliquary stupa at Tongdosa, which he wrote about in a document called To Felicitate the Construction of the Reliquary Stupa of Tongdosa, Yangsan, Gyeongsang-do and the Restoration of Jangnyukjeon Hall of Hwaeomsa, Gurye, Honam-do (慶尙道梁山通度寺聖骨靈塔及湖南求禮華嚴寺丈六重建慶讚疏). Sin Daehyeon claims that the role Suyeon played at Hwaeomsa was almost, if not equal in importance to that of Seongneung. See Sin 2009, pp.109-112 Construction of the hall was completed in 1702, for which seven altar statues were produced the following year and a week-long great dharma assembly held to commemorate their enshrinement. The building was renamed Gakhwangjeon Hall (Hall of the Enlightened Lord) after a new name table was sent from the capital. According to the inscription, it was produced in 1703 by Lee Jinhyu (1657-1710), a junior second grade official in the Ministry of Punishments.In 1705 Lee became a junior second grade official (champan) in the Ministry of Rites. An accomplished calligrapher, later examples of his work can be found on a monument adjoining the reliquary stupa at Tongdosa, and another at Seonamsa commemorating its repair. The presence of the official's signature is a seen as a clear indication that Lee was ordered to write the name tablet by the royal court.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.140 Renovations Gakhwangjeon Hall was repaired in 1768 by Great Zen Master Jaun Cheogwan. The nature of the work is unknown but the names and duties of the workers have survived in the Hwaeomsa Chronicle. Also participating were monks, soldiers and villagers from the nearby temples of Cheongyesa and Yeongoksa, in Gurye county, as well as Gamnosa, in Namwon, the later one of the major patrons of the work. The building was repaired again in 1847 to replace rotted wood, broken roof tiles and wall paintings. This was followed by more work in 1851, 1860 (when new altar paintings were enshrined), and again in 1885.Lee 1997, pp.102-103 The hall then underwent significant renovation in the Japanese colonial period, during which it was completely disassembled and then rebuilt. The only surviving accounts come from Gaijiro Fujishima (1899-2002), the Japanese architect who first proposed and was later appointed to lead the renovations. Gaijiro first visited Hwaeomsa in 1928, making two more visits during the same year to research and photograph the temple. He published his study in 1930,Published in 建築雑誌 (Journal of Architecture and Building Science) Vol. 44 No. 536, August 1930. emphasizing the urgency of making repairs to Gakhwangjeon Hall, the roof of which was so badly damaged that it was letting in rain while several collapsed columns had also caused the building to lean over. After becoming abbot of Hwaeomsa, Jeong Byeongheon petitioned for and received financial support from the Government General to cover the substantial costs of the renovations, which would have otherwise been beyond the means of the temple. The renovations began in 1936, but as no report was ever published, the alterations made to the building have had to be deduced from surviving blueprints produced during the repairs as well as from photos taken immediately after the work was completed in May 1941.Lee 1997, pp.103-105 The hall has been repaired several times since liberation. In 1961, repairs were made to the roof under the direction of Im Cheon (1908-1965), who had also participated in the restoration of the hall's wall paintings in 1939.Lee 1997, pp.109-110 More roof work was probably carried out in 1964. From 1966 to 1969, the building was restored again and a survey of the building was also carried out by the Bureau of Cultural Property. There was more roof work in 1983, while the altar was repaired in 1984.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.324 Another survey by the Bureau of Cultural Property, this time of all the temple buildings and stonework, was carried out from 1985 to 1986. In 2000 the roof was repaired again, as was the front staircase. A survey was conducted of Gakhwangjeon Hall from 2008 to 2009 by the Cultural Heritage Administration.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.67 Architecture Gakhwangjeon Hall is the largest hall of Hwaeomsa,Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.94 and overlooks the northwest end of the courtyard. However, although it is the temple's most prominent structure, the adjacent Daeungjeon Hall is the main hall.Jeon, Kim and So 2000, p.47 Base Gakhwangjeon Hall stands on the same granite base once used by Jangnyukjeon Hall, constructed in the post and lintel style (gagusikgidan) that was emblematic of late Unified Silla architecture. At a height of about ,Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.152-155 its size is more comparable with Joseon palace architecture than contemporary Buddhist halls.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.117 The walls measure along the face and on the sides, their surfaces interrupted at regular intervals by post stones. Lintels are laid over top, forming nearly symmetrical eaves with the edges of the square slab stones the base rests on. The rectangular surface is covered in square inlaid blocks with a total area of . There are forty round column bases set on square pedestals, each about across and carved from single pieces of granite. After centuries of sinking under the weight of the building, the heights of the column bases have come to vary widely. Traces of the groves that once held in place the stone plates inscribed with the Flower Garland Sutra are also visible on many of their sides.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.118 Four smaller square column bases are found at the corners of the building for the poles buttressing the eaves of the roof. The staircases at the center of the face and rear, as well as toward the front on the sides, each have six steps and triangular slabs which form the railings. A culvert runs around the rear and sides of the building. The base underwent extensive restoration during the colonial-era. Many sections had to be replaced with new masonry, in part due to the fire damage sustained during the Imjin War as well as from centuries of accumulated decay. Prior to restoration, the basic shape of the facade had still been largely intact but the other three sides had lost nearly all form. Extant diagrams from the period indicate that the lintel stones were shattered while many of the walls had crumbled to pieces.Lee 1997, p.106 Most of the square blocks presently covering the surface were also laid during this period, although they are known to have been part of the original design.Lee 1997, p.126 Structure Gakhwangjeon Hall is two stories high, its wooden structure typical of late Joseon Buddhist architecture.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.120-121 The walls of the first floor are supported by twenty-four columns high,Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.170 and measure along the length of the hall and along the sides.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.147 The second floor walls are by and made up of a further sixteen columns high that form a concentric rectangle surrounding the altar.Cheon and Jeon 2002, pp.129-131 The interior columns and the four central columns, which are high and positioned behind the altar, together support the roof of the second floor. Each of the columns were made from individual tree trunks, initially just stripped of their bark with the natural curvature largely left in. The outer columns and the upper part of the interior columns, though, were refashioned into more standard tapered columns during the colonial-era, and a few were replaced with new timber altogether.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.162 The hall is seven bays across and five deep. The central bays are the widest and grow narrower toward the extremities to draw attention to the center of the building. The bay lengths are the same across both floors except for the outermost of the second floor, which are half the length of the lower floor. The exterior and interior columns are connected laterally at the heads with mortise and tenon joints, reinforced with thick lintels that rest on the tenons, and to each other by a series of crossbeams. The extensive latticework installed between the columns allows light to flood the inner sanctuary and creates a more open environment than other contemporary structures.Lee 1997, pp.136-137 On the first floor, the three central bays of the facade have four-panel doors while the remainder have two-paneled doors. These doors open inwards and use the ornate gyeokjagyosal lattice—a combination of a vertical, horizontal and 45° diagonal lattice ribs—in the midsection, with a section of diagonal lattice (bitsalmun) above and a flat panel below.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.234 The use of gyeokjagyosal was exceptionally rare, earlier examples of which from the Joseon Dynasty are found only at Geungnakjeon Hall of Muwisa and Daeungjeon Hall of Hongguksa. Outward opening door panels with comparatively modest belt- lattice (ddisalmun) occupy the first, third and fifth bays of the side walls and all but the outer-most bays of the rear wall, which have fixed wall panels of the same design instead. The mild degree of weathering seen in the side and rear doors compared to the front suggest that they were repaired or even replaced during the colonial-era. The spaces between the columns of the second floor have windows of vertical lattice (jeongjamun), the light passing through which illuminates the faces of the altar statues. Inner sanctuary The interior of the hall is a single open space of a size rarely seen at a Korean temple.Jeon, Kim and So 2000, p.77 The large wooden altar is named Sumidan after Mount Sumeru. Situated at the absolute center of the building, it occupies a space five bays long by one deep. Its three-tiered structure, with raised daises for altar statues, was widely used in the 17th and 18th centuries. Notably, the panels along the face and sides, which lack either painting or relief imagery, as well as the uncharacteristically simple borders, suggest that the altar was reconstructed along simpler lines during the colonial-era renovations. The absence of a canopy, however, is typical for halls of this size.Lee 1997, pp.129-130 The coffered ceiling of recessed panels is flat directly above the altar (an area equivalent to three by one bays) but otherwise slanted downwards. The central columns, which stretch across the hall, form a wall behind the altar from which the altar paintings hang. The rear side is covered in mortuary tablets for the deceased, at the center of which is a statue of the Buddha Amithaba dating to the modern era. The central position of the wall and altar appear to sharply reduce the size of the worship space when compared to the relatively large area at the rear of the hall. Red fences with spiked tops (hongsalchaek) had originally been used to block passage from the rear to the interior of the hall but these were removed during the colonial-era. The inlaid blocks of the stone base were visible until they were covered with wooden flooring in 1998. Roof The two-tiered roof is gabled on the first floor and hipped on the second.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.223-224 Their double eaves appear to curl up at the edges, the exposed rafters spread evenly along the lengths and then fanning out at the corners (seonjayeon).Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.211 The eight protruding corners are buttressed by poles that bend heavily under the weight.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.163 The ridge line is long, and the gables are high and across at their lowest points.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.228-230 Underneath the eaves is a canopy of multiple interlocking brackets. A total of 120 bracket clusters distributed across both floors (64 above, 56 below) support a set of two purlins on the interior and exterior of the building. There is one cluster atop each column and two intercolumnar clusters per bay, but only one in the outer bays of the first floor and none on the second because of their shorter length.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.182 The canopy is clearly functional rather than decorative, especially when contrasted to the great size of the roof and the greater elaborateness typically seen in one-story structures. The design of the each cluster's four brackets are identical on the exterior: the lower two curve upwards (angseohyeong), the third downward (suseohyeong), while the fourth spirals into cloud-shaped crockets (ungonghyeong). However, on the inside there are eight varieties of the upper two brackets, varying in design according to their position within the hall.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.193 The elephant-shaped appearance of the upper bracket crockets was common to 17th-century Buddhist halls, but the lower two brackets have an almost quarter circle-like curvature unlike the more commonly seen bowed shaped. The roof has been re-tiled multiple times since the renovations of the 1930s. The tiles on the upper tier are of the traditional Korean style (guwa), and include a combination of hand- made and machine-made tiles, several of which notably bear a stamp that reads \\"Repaired in the 12th and 13th year of Shōwa\\" (1937 to 1938);昭和十二十三年修補 the lower tier has modern machine-made tiles only. The eaves alternate between crescent-shaped tiles (ammaksae) carved with double-headed dragons bisected by an inscription with their year of production (1967 or 1999), and circular tiles (sumaksae) with either a ten-leaf lotus flower or the syllable om in Sanskrit. Perched at the ends of the ridge line and the corners of the eaves are decorative tiles (mangwa) identical to the crescent-shaped eave tiles. The ones at the bottom of the gables, though dating to 1938, were modeled after the original tiles from 1700 and include the names of financial contributors to the roof work. Adornments The name tablet of Gakhwangjeon Hall surrounded by the faded rafters and bracketing of the roof. The name tablet of Gakhwangjeon Hall is affixed between the lintel and the rafters of the central bay on the second floor. Measuring across and tall, the tablet is composed of vertical planks of wood attached side by side and encased in a frame. Although the gold leaf that once adorned the background has faded completely bare, the writing itself still retains its white coloring. Verse couplets (juryun) written onto eight tablets hang from each of the first floor columns at the front of the building.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.142 Such verses are usually related to the icons enshrined inside, but in the case of Gakhwangjeon Hall the first stanza of four lines describes the monk Yeongi, the founder of Hwaeomsa, and was borrowed from the writings of National Preceptor Uicheon (1055-1101); meanwhile the second stanza is of unknown origin. From right side of the building to left they read: > 1\\\\. 偉論雄經罔不通 Mastering both the Mahayana and the Avatamsaka, > 2\\\\. 一生弘護有深功 His merits vast from a life of defending the dharma. > 3\\\\. 三千義學分燈後 Having shared the light of the Buddha's teaching with his 3000 > disciples, > 4\\\\. 圓敎宗風滿海東 The precepts of the Avatamsaka have spread across the land. > > 5\\\\. 西來一燭傳三世 This one eastern light taught to the past, present and future, > 6\\\\. 南國千年闡五宗 Over a thousand years diffusing from the south into the five > schools. > 7\\\\. 遊償此增淸淨債 For one to surpass such immaculate merits, > 8\\\\. 白雲回首與誰同 It is as the head of a cloud turns, who could do the same? > ｢기시론｣과 ｢화엄경｣을 통달하신 데다 > 일생 동안 호법하신 공도 크시네 > 삼천 제자에게 불법의 등불 나눠주니 > 화엄 원교의 종풍이 해동에 가득하네 > 서쪽에서 온 등불 하나 삼세에 전하니 > 남쪽에서 천 년 동안 오종으로 퍼져갔네 > 뉘라서 이 청정한 공을 보태어 갚으랴 > 흰 구름 머리 돌리니 누구와 더불어 함께 할까 The year of their production is unknown but the signature indicates that the tablets were produced by Kim Yonggu (1907-1982), the same calligrapher who made the verse tablets for Daeungjeon Hall.Choi 2002, pp.115-116 The tablets are undecorated, measuring about in length and across. Colonial-era wind bells hang from each of the eight protruding corners.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.214 Dancheong The dancheong, or decorative paintwork, of Gakhwangjeon Hall's exterior has almost completely worn away. The remnants around the bracketing, and photos from Record of Ancient Sites and Monuments in Korea, however, indicate that the building had originally been painted in the sophisticated geumdancheong style. The triangular-shaped wall paintings between the bracket clusters of the first floor are the largest visible sections, alternating between potted lotus flowers and peony blossoms. On the facade they are depicted in full bloom but on the side walls they can be seen growing smaller in size until towards the rear, where the lotuses are mere buds while the peonies appear as lilies of the valley. The considerable fading make it impossible to see the flowers' original coloring except for some spots of barely visible white, crimson and green, and the outlines of the flower pots. It appears as though the design of the rear differed entirely from the front, as evidenced by the three remaining paintings of the egret, depicted flying with great composure, wings completely extended, while their long and slender necks droop downwards and their legs are raised as if to take a step forward. The extant wall paintings on the second floor are exclusively lotus flowers.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.247-248 The painted surfaces of the interior are in a relatively better state of preservation, revealing the hall to be a striking example of Jeolla-do regional dancheong,Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.247 as well as representing a transition between 17th- and 18th-century styles. A diversity of ornate patterns making great use of green, salmon, and red ocher cover every surface of the beams and brackets.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.260 The ceiling panels are decorated with floral patterns of lotus flowers, peony blossoms, crimson four-leaf flowers (juhwa), and floating lotuses. The panels on the flat portion of the ceiling each display floral patterns against a background of red ocher while surrounded by arabesques of green, blue and salmon. On the slanted portion of the ceiling the panels feature a lotus flower surrounded by flowers and arabesques, or with a Chinese character written in each of its eight petals.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.256 The spaces between the purlins are decorated with cloud patterns (unmun) on an earth-yellow background and outlined in green.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.257-258 Wall panels depicting the arhats line the upper floor, between each of which dragon faces have been painted. Some arhats appear to face outwards with backs bent over like a crescent- shaped moon, or gaze skywards with a gaping mouth and hands folded in behind the back. Others are seen standing upright, wielding a cintamani in one hand, or have their heads lowered and eyes closed, as if in silent meditation. Their colorless figures have been captured with simple but powerful brush strokes, while the trails of their robes almost appear to disappear as they flutter into the wind. The spaces between the bracket clusters each display a seated Buddha. Painted onto a background of red ocher, each figure has a nimbus while the curled hair has been rendered in a heavily exaggerated manner. A gem is visible in the topknot while the oval face displays a crimson urna on the forehead. Both hands are raised chest high with the trails of the robes draped over top. Arhats are also painted onto many of the beams and walls of the lower floor, depicted by a stream under a green tree with a trunk colored brightly in red ocher, accompanied by a heavenly boy monk, dragon or tiger. Although drawn mostly in black ink against an earth-yellow background, the light coloring of the arhat's salmon skin, the tiger's white feet, and dragon's crimson tongue serve to accentuate the image. Visible elsewhere are images of apsaras carrying a janggu around the neck and a drumstick in the right hand, their heavenly robes fluttering in the wind as if descending from the heavens. The seated Buddhas among the brackets appear on lotus pedestals surrounded by nimbuses of the five cardinal colors; the urna is flesh-colored, while some images omit the topknot gem entirely. The hands are mainly seen in the Vajra or Dharmacakra mudrā, while some are positioned in the Bhumisparsha mudrā or with hands held chest-high. Written across the central tenons above the front entrance are His Majesty the Sovereign (主上殿下), Her Royal Highness the Queen Consort (王妃殿下), and His Royal Highness the Prince Successor (世子邸下).Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.254 Altar statues The Buddha Sakyamuni, attended by the Bodhisattvas Samantabhadra (left) and Manjusri (right), forming the Buddhas of the Three Periods with Prabhutaratna (far left) and Amitābha (far right). Seven statues are enshrined on the altar of Gakhwangjeon Hall. The primary icons are a seated triad depicting the Buddhas of the Three Periods giving salvation to sentient beings across all time, with Sakyamuni as the Buddha of the present, Prabhutaratna as Buddha of the past, and Amitābha as Buddha of the future (not to be confused with the triad of Sakyamuni, Dīpankara and Maitreya in the Lotus Sutra). This unusual combination of Buddha statues is unique to Hwaeomsa, but was frequently featured in gwebuls from the province of Jeolla throughout the 18th century, including pieces from Naesosa (1700), Cheonggoksa (1722), Anguksa (1728), Unheungsa (1730), Dabosa (1745), and Gaeamsa (1749). The origin of the arrangement may not be scriptural, Buddhist scholar Oh Jinhee asserts, rather representing a visualization from The Collected Five Voices of the Brahma,五種梵音集 a ceremonial book first published in 1661 used to wish the dead a peaceful afterlife. Its preface was written by Byeogam Gakseong, suggesting a role in the selection of icons decades before their realization.Oh 2006, pp.118-122 Four Bodhisattvas stand interspaced between the Buddhas. Viewing left to right, they are Avalokiteśvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion; Samantabhadra, the Bodhisattva of meditation; Manjusri, the Bodhisattva of wisdom; and Ksitigarbha, the Bodhisattva of hell.Jeon, Kim and So 2000, pp.125-126 To produce the icons, contributions of money, paddy fields, and grain were provided by eleven monks, seven laymen and one court lady.Jeon, Kim and So 2000, p.119 They were executed by a guild of twenty-three monks led by the influential sculptor Saengnan, from the temple of Neungasa, in Goheung County.Saengnan may have begun sculpting as early as the 1660s, and was probably in his 50s or 60s when he produced the altar statues for Gakhwangjeon Hall. Other extant examples of his work can be found at Jeongsusa (1684), Cheoneunsa (1693), Ssangbongsa (1694), the hermitage of Chukseongam (1700), as well as the hermitage of Seongdoam. The other primary sculptors were Chungok, Ilgi, Eungwon, Chupyeong, and Chubung, of whom the later three were probably Saengnan's most gifted disciples, having worked under him for about twenty years. Saengnan personally sculpted the statue of Sakyamuni and worked with Chubung to produce Avalokiteśvara, both pieces representing his finest work. Prabhutaratna and Manjusri were sculpted by Chungok, a monk from Songgwangsa who was working with Saengnan for the first time, but about whom little else is known. Amitabha was produced by Ilgi, of Naesosa, Samantabhadra by Eungwon, and Ksitigarbha by Chupyeong.Oh 2006, pp.130-136 Buddhas The Buddha statues were crafted to appear colossal in size so as to overwhelm worshipers. Sakyamuni, the largest of the three, is high and wide at the knees. Seated in the lotus position, the Buddha's upper body has rounded shoulders and a wide chest, while his hands are in the bhumisparsha mudrā.Oh 2006, p.123 Characteristically, the size of the head is large compared to the body.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.124 The face appears flat and square in shape but the curvature in the chin and cheeks, as well as the soft smile formed from its thin lips, give the icon a genial countenance. The facial features, especially the prominent nose between the statue's long, half-open eyes are an example of a style that first became prevalent with the Trikaya statues of Sinheungsa in 1651. There is an urna visible between the eyebrows, as well as an ushnisha, denoted by the hair cropped in small spiral curls, and a half-moon shaped jewel (gyeju) protruding just above the forehead. The robes drape over the left shoulder only, wrapping around the front in a U-shape, leaving the statue exposed from the chest to the upper waist. The waistcoat is creased into the shape of five lotus petals, and the ends of the robes trail off over the left knee in the shape of a lotus bud. The slightly smaller statues of Prabhutaratna and Amitābha closely resemble Sakyamuni,Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.125 in addition to forming near mirror images of each other. Each is depicted with their hands in a variation of the vitarka mudrā, whereby the thumb and the middle finger touch while the remaining fingers are extended. In the case of Prabhutaratna, the left hand is raised while the right rests lightly over the knee, while on Amitābha this is reversed.Oh 2006, p.124 Just above the legs there are two folds in the robes of Prabhutaratna compared to three for Amitābha, an example of the greater simplicity typically found in the attendant to the right in sculpture from this period. The two figures stand high and wide. Bodhisattvas The statues of Manjusri and Samantabhadra are to the direct left and right, respectively, of Sakyamuni. Towards the extremities of the altar, Avalokiteśvara is to the right of Amitābha and Ksitigarbha to the left of Prabhutaratna. The mudras of the figures are symmetrical across the altar: on the right side, the hands of Samantabhadra and Avalokiteśvara are positioned the same as Amitābha; while on the opposite side, those of Ksitigarbha and Manjusri match Prabhutaratna.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.125-126 Each Bodhisattva stands high and across at the shoulders. Despite the difference in their postures, the overall physical presentation and sculptural technique displayed by the Bodhisattvas are identical to that of the Buddha statues. The faces, in particular, have the same half-open eyes, protruding nose and thin lips characteristic of late 17th-century Buddhist sculpture. But in contrast to the relative simplicity of the seated Buddhas, the standing Bodhisattva statues are highly ornate, especially in their elaborate crowns and drapery.Oh 2006, p.125-128 The crown is positioned high atop the topknot from which billowing flames appear to be pouring down each side of the head. The upper section is adorned with five flame ornaments surrounding a small flower at the center, inside which are two birds who sit facing each other. A ten-leaf lotus flower surrounded by flames adorns the lower half of the crown along with several five-petaled flowers, while to each side sits a fenghuang on a finely sculpted cloud. From underneath the crown, a strand of the Bodhisattva's minutely depicted hair can be seen twisting and meandering down each side of the head. The drapery of Manjusri and Samantabhadra is largely identical. Their robes display an elaborate array of folds and creases that resemble lotus flowers around the waist and serrated blades of grass near the knees. The outer cloaks are rendered in the style of celestial garments, draped over both shoulders and flowing downward to the feet. Wide belts are wrapped around each figure's waist, the ends of which are tied in knots and flow down between the legs, twisting together at the feet. Unlike Manjusri, though, Samantha's belt is sumptuously decorated with flowers. The drapery of Ksitigarbha and Avalokiteśvara is also identical. Their outer cloaks resemble those worn by monks, covering both of Ksitigarbha's shoulders but only the right of Avalokiteśvara. Shaped like a crescent on the right side, the cloaks are folded at the elbows and flow downward toward the feet. A waistcoat is worn over their robes, which are decoratively folded below the waist in what appears to be the shape of a letter U veering slightly to the right. The hems at the bottom are pointed like the trailing end of a bird's wing. Altar paintings Three altar paintings depicting the Buddhas of the Three Periods (samsebulhoedo) were executed in 1860 by the monks Haeun, Punggok, Seoun, Cheoru, Wolheo, Haemyeong and Seoam.Choi 1994, p.56 The artists, though, mistook Prabhutaratna for Bhaisajyaguru, the Buddha of healing and medicine, who is depicted in the altar painting to the left. The true identity of the altar statue only became evident when the \\"chest concealed record\\" (bokjanggi)佛像服藏記 Lee 1997, p.89 was retrieved from inside one of the statues in 1975.An et al. 1996, p.172 Although it is unknown how the statue's identity came to be forgotten, Hwang Hogyun suggests that the change to Bhaisajyaguru may simply reflect a development in belief structure that occurred over the 150 years separating the production of the statues and the paintings.Hwang 2002, p.59 Each piece is largely identical in style and structure, with a seated Buddha surrounded by over twenty attendants arranged symmetrically in three rows that span the width of the canvas. The figures are painted in gold onto red silk (hongtaenghwa), each of the canvases made from attaching together eleven separate lengths of silk side by side. The delicate brush strokes and the effective use of contrasting color compensate in vividness for the size and uniformity of the paintings. The attendants decrease in size while the brightness of their skin increases from the bottom to the top of the paintings, adding perspective and creating a visual synergy characteristic of Joseon-era Buddhist art.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.133-134 They are in an excellent state of preservation except for some slight peeling along the edges, and are described by the Cultural Heritage Administration as \\"having significant historical value for their display of the main characteristics of Joseon Buddhist art.\\"\\"...조선불화의 정형을 보여주고 있어 미술사적 가치는 매누 크다고 하곘다.\\" Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.139 On the wall to the left of the altar is a painting of the assembly of guardian deities (sinjungtaenghwa),Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.150 executed in 1965 by Kim Uil (1901-1998), the best pupil of the Buddhist artist Kim Ilseop (1901-1975).Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, p.207 On the opposite side of the hall are portraits of Zen Master Reesandan Dogwang (1937-1984) and Patriarch Dongheondang Wongyu (1896-1983). Sakyamuni Sakyamuni is enshrined on a lotus throne high atop an altar of Sumeru colored in wood grain and highly detailed. He is seated right leg over left in the lotus position at the center of the painting, his hands in the bhumisparsha mudra and the right shoulder left bare. His crimson robes display elaborate drapery, the folds emphasized with steely, yet buoyant lines. The cross striped hems of the garment are decorated in a pattern of scattered flowers outlined in gold. The spirals in Sakyamuni's conch shaped hair are minutely detailed, and auspicious beams of light ascend towards the heavens from his crimson colored ushnisha. The facial features are perfectly centered on his large face, which, like the bare arms and chest, are painted in a light yellowish-white hue. His large nose protrudes out from between the small eyes and thin eyebrows, while the red lips create an appearance of benevolence. Comparatively small for his size, the oval shaped nimbus surrounding Sakyamuni's body and head is green, outlined in seven different colors and golden flames. An assembly of twenty- eight deities surrounds the Buddha. At the forefront, making up the first row, are the Four Great Bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara, Manjusri, Samantabhadra and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. The halos of Manjusri and Samantabhadra are green and outlined in gold, in contrast to those of Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta, which are done in gold only. Avalokiteśvara is holding a blue kundika, Manjusri a lotus bud, Samantabhadra a cintamani, while the hands of Mahāsthāmaprāpta are clasped together. Pedestals of blue lotus flowers can be seen beneath their feet. In the second row, Sakyamuni is flanked by the Buddhas Vipaśyīn Buddha and Śikhīn Buddha (seen near Sakyamuni's head), below whom are the Eight Great Bodhisattvas arranged symmetrically in groups of four. They are depicted slightly smaller than the Bodhisattvas of the front row, and with brighter skin. Maitreya, Vajragarbha, Bhaisajyaraja and Mahêśvara are on the left side while Dīpankara, Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin, Bhaiṣajyasamudgata and Śakra are on the right. The bodies, robes, crowns, and halos are outlined in gold against the red background, while the hair is cobalt blue. At the rear of the assembly, the third row is made up of the ten principal disciples, a pair of heavenly boy monks and another pair of apsaras. Except for their black hair and exposed flesh of their faces and hands, these figures are red and outlined in gold. The canvas measures by . Bhaisajyaguru The painting of Bhaisajyaguru is substantially the same as Sakyamuni in composition and color tone. The Buddha is enthroned on a lotus throne atop a wood grain colored altar of Sumidan, seated in the lotus position underneath a white lotus canopy. Like the statue of Prabhutaratna before him, Bhaisajyaguru's hands are in the vitarka mudrā, with the thumb and middle finger touching while the remaining fingers are extended, the left hand raised while the right rests on the leg. A medicine box is held in the left hand, the lower half decorated in a fret and the upper half colored green. The facial features match Sakyamuni, but the head and ushinisha have been rendered in lama style, from which auspicious beams of light stream out in three directions. Although the body is well-proportioned overall, the breadth of the knees appear small compared to the torso, in addition to being much smaller than the lower body of Sakyamuni. The Buddha's red robes display a rope curtain pattern of yellowish-white with a band of flowers and serrated half- circles embroidered along the ends. They are draped over the right shoulder, while an overcoat covers the left shoulder and has been lightly thrown over the right shoulder. The body is surrounded by a circular nimbus of cobalt blue and the head in a halo of green, both outlined in the five cardinal colors. An assembly of twenty-two deities surrounds Bhaisajyaguru. Standing in the first row are the Bodhisattvas Suryaprabha and Candraprabha, flanked, respectively, by the Heavenly Kings of the south and west, Virūḍhaka and Virūpākṣa. The second row is made up of the Bodhisattvas Maitreya, Manjusri, and Vajragarbha on the right side of Bhaisajyaguru, while Avalokiteśvara, Samantabhadra, and Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin are on the left. In the third row, to the right of the Buddha's nimbus, are the Buddha Viśvabhū, a Snake spirit general, and a heavenly boy-monk, while to the left are the Buddha Krakucchanda, another serpent spirit general, and an apsara. Like the painting of Sakyamuni, the size of the attendants grow smaller towards the rear and their skin color grows white. In addition, the skin color of Bhaisajyaguru and the eight Bodhisattvas surrounding him has been brightened to a yellowish-white hue, focusing the attention of the viewer on the center of the painting. The various attendants' bodies, robes and crowns are painted with strong steely lines, while items like the vajra and jeweled sword are brightly painted in white-ultramarine to add contrasting color.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.135-137 The canvas measures by . Amitābha The painting of Amitābha appears symmetrical to that of Bhaisajyaguru. Its composition and form, patterns and coloring are identical, as are the shape of the face and mudra. However, while the drapery is also the same, unlike Bhaisajyaguru the fluttering sleeve of Amitābha's right arm leaves the skin exposed from below the elbow. This is meant to distinguish the different roles of the two Buddhas. An assembly of twenty-two deities surrounds Amitābha. The facial expressions of the four deities in the first row are depicted with great joy. To the left are the Bodhisattva Cundi and the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra playing a musical instrument, while to the right are Mahāsthāmaprāpta and the Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa holding both a pagoda and a floral pennant. Six Bodhisattvas surround Bhaisajyaguru in the second row: the three to the left are probably Maitreya, Manjusri and Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin, while those to the right are Ksitigarbha, Samantabhadra and Vajragarbha. In the third row, Amitābha is flanked, respectively, by the Buddhas of the past Kanakamuni and Kassapa (visible by Amitābha's halo), behind whom are Sariputta, Subhuti, Hogyedaesin, Yama, Sarasvati towards the left, while Ananda, Bokdeokdaesin, the Dragon King Sagara, and Lakshmi are to the right (one figure has yet to be unidentified). At the very top, devas flank the white lotus canopy.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall 2009, pp.137-139 The canvas measures by . Assembly of Guardian Deities The figures making up the assembly of guardian deities are arranged into four rows spread across the painting. At the center of the first row is Skanda, the Bodhisattva of the Protection of Buddhist Doctrine. To the left are Saraswati, Hogyedaesin, Vaisravana and Dhrtarastra, and to the right are Lakshmi, Bokdeokdaesin, Vaiśravaṇa and Virūpākṣa. On the left side of the second row are Tojisin, Garamsin, Panchika, Munhosin, the Water-ruling spirit, and Bangwisin; while to the right side are Doryangsin, Oktaeksin, Mahogara, Juhwasin, and Sijiksin. In the center of the third row is an Asura, to whose left are Sikhin, Jusansin, a kinnara, and Sūrya, and to whose right are Śakra, Garuda, Jujosin, and Candra. The fourth row is composed of ten apsaras and heavenly boy monks.Bak et al 1998, p.211 The canvas measures by .Hwang 2002, pp.62-63 Legacy Gakhwangjeon Hall is an outstanding example of Joseon Dynasty Buddhist architecture,Jeon, Kim and So 2000, p.70 and was designated National Treasure 67 in 1962.Survey Report of Gakhwangjeon Hall, 2009, p.117 It is one of only four extant multi-story Buddhist halls dating to the 17th century; its contemporaries including Daeungbojeon Hall (1618) and Palsangjeon Hall (1626) of Beopjusa, as well as Mireukjeon Hall (1635) of Geumsansa.

Infection is centered in the placenta and there is risk of spreading to the uterus, causing pelvic infection or becoming systemic to cause sepsis and potential damage of distant vital organs.\\" Signs and symptoms In a woman with septic abortion, signs and symptoms that are related to the infection are mainly: * High fever, usually above 101 °F / 38 °C * Chills * Severe abdominal pain and/or cramping /or strong perineal pressure * Beginning miscarriage symptoms (heavy bleeding and or cramping) that suddenly stops and does not resume * Prolonged or heavy vaginal bleeding * Foul-smelling vaginal discharge * Backache or heavy back pressure A cold or urinary tract infection may mimic many of the symptoms. As the condition becomes more serious, signs of septic shock may appear, including: * Low blood pressure (hypotension) * Low body temperature (hypothermia) * Little or no urine output (oliguria) * Respiratory distress (dyspnea and labored breathing) Septic shock may lead to kidney failure, bleeding diathesis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Intestinal organs may also become infected, potentially causing scar tissue with chronic pain, intestinal blockage, and infertility. If the septic abortion is not treated quickly and effectively, the woman may die. Causes Septic abortion is often a complication of an infection of the upper genital tract by multiple strains of gram positive and/or gram negative bacteria. Septic abortion can occur when these bacteria enter the uterus or even when the natural vaginal flora becomes pathogenic. Also, sexually transmitted infections (STI) such as chlamydia may cause septic abortion. Risk factors The risk of a septic abortion is increased by mainly the following factors: *The fetal membranes surrounding the fetus have ruptured, sometimes without being detected * The woman has a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia * An intrauterine device (IUD) was left in place during the pregnancy * Tissue from the fetus or placenta is left inside the uterus after a miscarriage or elective abortion procedure * Unsafe abortion was made to end the pregnancy * Insertion of tools, chemicals, or soaps into the uterus Treatment The woman should have intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure and urine output (oliguria or hypouresis are both names from roots meaning \\"not enough urine;\\" these terms refer to the low output of urine). Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be given until the fever is gone. There are different antibiotic regimens which are almost equal such as intravenous clindamycin, penicillin plus chloramphenicol, cephalothin plus kanamycin. And only one research found that tetracycline is more effective to decrease the time of fever than penicillin G. However, new studies are needed to establish the most effective antibiotic in septic abortion. A dilatation and curettage (D&C;) or misoprostol may be needed to clean the uterus of any residual tissue. Rh negative blood should be given to the patient in addition to an injection of Rh immune globulin, unless the father is also known to be Rh negative. In cases so severe that abscesses have formed in the ovaries and tubes, it may be necessary to remove the uterus by hysterectomy, and possibly other infected organs as well. After successful treatment of a septic abortion, a woman may be tired for several weeks. In case of substantial bleeding, iron supplementation may be helpful. Sexual intercourse or the use of tampons should be avoided until recommended by the healthcare provider.

It is a Grade I listed building. It is the historic minster or church from which Upminster derives its name, meaning 'upper church', probably signifying 'church on higher ground'. The place-name is first attested as 'Upmynster' in 1062, and appears as 'Upmunstra' in the Domesday Book of 1086. History Alice Perrers, mistress of King Edward III, was buried in the church or churchyard in 1400. There is no memorial to mark her grave. She had three illegitimate children by the king, and later lived and died in the manor of Gaynes in Upminster. The tower of St Laurence's was instrumental in the first accurate measurement of the speed of sound by Rev William Derham, who was also buried in the church or churchyard and who also, by his own wish, has no memorial. Description The church is a good example of 13th-century construction. The tower dates from this period, and is rubble- walled, with buttresses at the foot, and a leaded and shingled spire, typical of Essex. The church was largely rebuilt in 1862-3 by W. G. Bartleet. Further rebuilding took place in 1928, when the original chancel became part of the nave, and the new choir and sanctuary were built, by Sir Charles Nicholson. Nicholson also built the current south chapel and Lady Chapel, on the north side. The pulpit is by Violet Pinwill of Devon. The baptismal font is 15th- century, and came from Upminster Hill Chapel. The monuments include those of the Branfills of Upminster Hall, and the Esdailes of Gaynes. The churchyard contains war graves of six service personnel of World War II.

Equivalently, a suitably defined dual set is relatively dense in the Pontryagin dual of the group. This notion was introduced by Yves Meyer in 1970 and later turned out to play an important role in the mathematical theory of quasicrystals. Some related concepts are model sets, Meyer sets, and cut- and-project sets.  Definition  Let Λ be a subset of a locally compact abelian group G and Λd be the subgroup of G generated by Λ, with discrete topology. A weak character is a restriction to Λ of an algebraic homomorphism from Λd into the circle group: : \\\\chi: \\\\Lambda_d\\\\to\\\\mathbf{T}, \\\\quad \\\\chi\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Hom}(\\\\Lambda_d,\\\\mathbf{T}). A strong character is a restriction to Λ of a continuous homomorphism from G to T, that is an element of the Pontryagin dual of G. A set Λ is harmonious if every weak character may be approximated by strong characters uniformly on Λ. Thus for any ε > 0 and any weak character χ, there exists a strong character ξ such that : \\\\sup_\\\\Lambda |\\\\chi(\\\\lambda)-\\\\xi(\\\\lambda)\\\\leq \\\\epsilon, \\\\quad \\\\chi\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Hom}(\\\\Lambda_d,\\\\mathbf{T}), \\\\xi\\\\in\\\\hat{G}. If the locally compact abelian group G is separable and metrizable (its topology may be defined by a translation-invariant metric) then harmonious sets admit another, related, description. Given a subset Λ of G and a positive ε, let Mε be the subset of the Pontryagin dual of G consisting of all characters that are almost trivial on Λ: : \\\\sup_\\\\Lambda|\\\\chi(\\\\lambda)-1\\\\leq \\\\epsilon, \\\\quad \\\\chi\\\\in\\\\hat{G}. Then Λ is harmonious if the sets Mε are relatively dense in the sense of Besicovitch: for every ε > 0 there exists a compact subset Kε of the Pontryagin dual such that : M_\\\\epsilon + K_\\\\epsilon = \\\\hat{G}.  Properties  * A subset of a harmonious set is harmonious. * If Λ is a harmonious set and F is a finite set then the set Λ \\\\+ F is also harmonious. The next two properties show that the notion of a harmonious set is nontrivial only when the ambient group is neither compact nor discrete. * A finite set Λ is always harmonious. If the group G is compact then, conversely, every harmonious set is finite. * If G is a discrete group then every set is harmonious.  Examples  Interesting examples of multiplicatively closed harmonious sets of real numbers arise in the theory of diophantine approximation. * Let G be the additive group of real numbers, θ >1, and the set Λ consist of all finite sums of different powers of θ. Then Λ is harmonious if and only if θ is a Pisot number. In particular, the sequence of powers of a Pisot number is harmonious. * Let K be a real algebraic number field of degree n over Q and the set Λ consist of all Pisot or Salem numbers of degree n in K. Then Λ is contained in the open interval (1,∞), closed under multiplication, and harmonious. Conversely, any set of real numbers with these 3 properties consists of all Pisot or Salem numbers of degree n in some real algebraic number field K of degree n.

After retiring as an athlete, he pursued careers in sports marketing, law, and print and TV journalism. He has covered five Olympic Games for NBC Sports as a color commentator in track and field. He later became a noted sports official, serving as the CEO of USA Track & Field from 1997 to 2008, where he tripled revenues, quadrupled sponsor revenue, and helped implement programs that substantially increased funds to and services for elite athletes. He is currently the Nike, Inc. Vice President of Sports Marketing for Greater China, Japan, & Global Business Affairs.  Early life and education  Masback was brought up in White Plains, New York. He graduated from White Plains Senior High School in 1973. He attended Princeton University, where he was co-captain of the track and field team and competed on the cross country team. He was a Magna Cum Laude graduate of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public & International Affairs in 1977 and received Princeton’s Harold Willis Dodds Prize, which recognizes the senior who best embodies “qualities of clear thinking, moral courage, a patient and judicious regard for the opinions of others, and a thoroughgoing devotion to the welfare of the university and to the life of the mind.” He also received the William Winston Roper Trophy, awarded to the Princeton “man of high scholastic rank and outstanding qualities of sportsmanship and general proficiency in athletics.” He was awarded an NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship and attended Trinity College, Oxford University from 1977-1979 on a Henry Griffth Keasbey Memorial Scholarship. At Oxford, he pursued a graduate degree (M. Litt.) in Politics, but did not receive a degree. In 1994, he earned a J.D. degree from the Yale Law School, where he was a recipient of a Ford Foundation International grant and was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. Athletic career  In high school, Masback was the New York State Indoor Champion at 600 yards (1973) and won the Eastern States and Golden West Invitational track and field meets at 880 yards (1973). At Princeton, he was the anchor leg on a Two-Mile Relay that won the NCAA Indoor Championships (1975) and finished second in the NCAA Distance Medley Relay indoors (1976). He finished sixth in the NCAA Indoor Championships in the mile run (1977). He was a two-time IC4A Champion and an eight-time Heptagonal (and Ivy League) Champion at various distances (including relays). He launched a professional running career while at Oxford, improving his personal best mile time from 4:01.8 (1977) to 3:52.02, which when he ran it on July 17, 1979 in Oslo’s Bislet Stadium established him as the sixth fastest miler in history. It was one of his 30 sub-four-minute miles. His first sub-four-minute mile was run at the Iffley Road track in Oxford, England, where he was the second man to break four minutes. Twenty-four years earlier, on the same track, Roger Bannister's legendary run shattered the four-minute barrier for the first time in history. Masback became U.S. Indoor champion in the mile run in 1980.[3] He finished third twice in the 1500 meters at the English Championships, the AAA Championships, in 1978 and 1981. His best 1500 meter time was 3:35.28, recorded in Lausanne, Swtizerland in 1982. That same year Masback established an American record of 5:00.11 in the 2000 meters in Bordeaux, France. Masback represented the United States 10 times in international competition in indoor and outdoor track and field. He won a bronze medal at the 1985 Pacific Conference Games. He also competed at the 1985 IAAF World Cup as a member of a U.S. team that captured the team title. Masback was a co-founder (with John Smith and Henry Hines) of the Association of Track & Field Athletes (1980), an athlete’s union for professional track athletes dedicated toward bringing about “open” era of track and field competition (“Track Athletes Spur Union Activity in Bid for Rights,” NYTimes, July 1, 1980, B14). Masback was also involved in later efforts to unionize track and field athletes, including in 1985.  Journalism work  While competing as a professional athlete, Masback began writing for newspapers and magazines. He published 12 opinion pieces and profiles in the New York Times, as well as articles for the Miami Herald, Sports Illustrated, The Runner Magazine, Ms. Magazine, and Runner’s World Magazine. From 1995 to 1997 he wrote a weekly online column for Runner’s World entitled “Bell Lap.” A partial list of articles includes: * The First 4-Minute Mile, 25 Years Later, May 6, 1979 https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/06/archives/the-first-4minute-mile-25-years- later-rg-bannister-3594-bannister-a.html * The Reasons Behind Britain’s Rise in Track Stature, NY Times, July 27, 1980, Sect. 5 p2 https://www.nytimes.com/1980/07/27/archives/views-of-sport-the-reasons-behind- britains-rise-in-track-stature.html * The Mile Has No Problem Surviving in a Metric Age, NY Times, July 19, 1981, Sect 5 p2 https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/sports/the-mile-has-no-problem-surviving- in-a-metric-age.html * Olympic Dreams That Got Away, NYTimes, July 29, 1984, Sect. 5 p2 https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/29/sports/olympic-dreams-that-got- away.html * When Sport Shatters Myths, Everyone Can Win, NYTimes, December 22, 1985, Sect.5 p2 https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/22/sports/views-of-sport-when- sport-shatters-myths-everyone-can-win.html * The Moroccan Paradox, The Runner, August 1986, p28 * Play It Again, Samaranch, The Runner, September 1986, p52 * Cycle of Drug Use Keeps Going Round, NYTimes, August 30, 1987 https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/sports/views-of-sport-cycle-of-drug-use- deeps-going-round.html * Mile Mannered, Runner’s World, February 1988, p28 * Siren of Speed, Ms., October 1988, p34 * Uncertain Course for Track & Field, NY Times, January 6, 1991, p8 https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/06/sports/views- of-sport-uncertain-course-for-track-and-field.html * A Sports White Paper for Clinton, NY Times, January 24, 1993, p11 https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/sports/backtalk-a-sports-white-paper-for- clinton.html * Prefontaine Legacy Enjoys a Long Run, NYTimes, June 4, 1995 * Back in the Race, Sports Illustrated, July 28, 1997, p8 * Memo From The Front, Brand Week, September 18, 2000, p62 * Rogge Can Make His Term as President of the IOC Count, July 22, 2001 https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/22/sports/olympics-rogge-can-make-his-term-as- president-of-ioc-count.html * The U.S., rightfully held to a higher standard, continues to be at the forefront of rooting out drug cheats, Los Angeles Times, March 9, 2003 (Point/Counterpoint)  Sports commentator  Masback has been a sports commentator covering track and field, marathon, and triathlon events for NBC, CBS, ESPN, ABC, PBS, TBS, and BET since 1981, including contributing to numerous Emmy Award-winning events. Masback covered middle and long distance races for NBC at the Rio Olympics, his fifth Olympic Games for NBC (Barcelona, Atlanta, Beijing, London) and continues to commentate for NBC and NBCSN covering high-profile events, including the World Track & Field Championships, Olympic Trials, USA Championships, Boston Marathon, and others.  Sports marketing/law  Masback worked as Director of Marketing & Sales for O’Neil Productions from 1986 to 1987. He was a co-founder, with Charlie Graves, of Inclyne Sports & Television, a sports event, sports marketing, and sports television production company with offices in New York and California. Inclyne produced numerous events and network television shows including the Foot Locker Slam Fest and the Jeep Tri-Prix for ESPN, NBC Sports, and ABC Sports. Upon graduation from law school in 1994, Masback became an associate at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering (now WilmerHale) in Washington, D.C., where he practiced primarily communications and sports law for firm clients such as USWest, CapCities/ABC, and the Dallas Cowboys and represented individual athletes in disciplinary matters before the NFL and Olympic sports governing bodies. He published articles concerning regulatory law and the Court of Arbitration for Sport. * Independence vs. Accountability: Correcting the Structural Defects in the National Endowment for the Arts, Yale Law & Policy Review, Volume 10, Number 1, 1992, p 177-202 * Supercarriers Compete in Global Arena (with William T. Lake), The National Law Journal, April 8, 1996, B7  Sports administrator  International Olympic Committee Masback worked as the assistant to the curator of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Museum & Library from 1982 to 1984 in Lausanne, Switzerland. USA Track and Field In mid-1997, Masback accepted the job of Chief Executive Officer of USA Track & Field (USATF), the national governing body for track and field, long distance running, and race walking. Upon accepting the position of USATF CEO, Masback said, \\"USATF is open to ideas, open for business, and open to change.\\" Masback tripled the organization's revenues and quadrupled sponsor revenues during his time as USATF CEO. With his leadership, the organization reached new heights in sponsorship, exposure and, most importantly, athletic success. USATF's budget rose from $6.7 million to close to $20 million under Masback. Masback renewed existing deals with Visa, Xerox, UCS, and Nike and signed General Motors and Verizon as sponsors in the 1998 to 2001 time period. From 2002 to 2007, Masback again extended deals with Xerox and Visa and added AT&T;, Hershey’s, Tyson, 24-Hour Fitness, Bengay, MBNA, and Sobe Sports Systems as sponsors and reached supplier deals with St. Vincent’s, Gill, and Ludos Tours. This allowed USATF to pay off a $3.5 million debt that Masback inherited from his predecessor and build a $5 million reserve at the time of his departure. In 1999, USATF launched the Golden Spike Tour, later known as the VISA Championship Series, ten elite track meets featuring the world's best athletes with coverage on NBC and ESPN and individual event sponsors such as Oracle, Verizon, Tyson, and Home Depot. From 2000 to 2008, the Visa Championship Series events and the Olympic Track & Field Trials featured record crowds and growing TV ratings, including a sell-out of 23,000 spectators a day for eight days at the Olympic Trials in 2000 and 2004, the largest turnouts in the 120+-year history of the Penn Relays (more than 112,000 spectators in 2004), and a 20% increase in TV ratings for the 2004-2005 seasons, which included 14 USATF-owned TV shows. Masback oversaw the creation of USATF’s High Performance Division, which overhauled USATF's relationship with and services for professional athletes and led to substantial increases in U.S. medals won at Olympic Games and World Championships. Many of the High Performance Division initiatives were outgrowths of the previous attempts to unionize track athletes, including Masback’s efforts in 1980 and 1985, and provide them with the resources to pursue professional track and field careers. Working with NASDAQ CEO Bob Greifeld, Masback launched the USATF Foundation in 2002, which generated new programmatic initiatives for elite and youth athletes and created a new source of funding for the sport. Many prominent American business executives became Foundation board members and created a number of innovative programs that support the sport at all levels. Faced with a series of doping scandals involving high-profile American athletes such as Marion Jones, Masback spearheaded the development of a Zero Tolerance anti-doping policy in 2003. In addition to raising awareness about doping, encouraging whistle-blowers, and seeking to ban athletes with drug positives from the sport, the Zero Tolerance program included a youth-focused “Be A Champion” initiative (later re-branded “Win With Integrity”) which provided elite athletes with a platform to speak with young people about how to achieve their athletic goals without breaking drug or other rules. Masback helped administer a nationwide search for a new location for the USA Track& Field Hall of Fame, which had closed prior to his arrival at USATF. After a process that included bids from multiple cities, the decision was made to place the Hall of Fame at the NYC Armory, which under the leadership of Norbert Sander raised funds sufficient to create a permanent home for the Hall of Fame, which attracts more than 200,000 visitors per year. In 2006, working with organizational sponsor Nike, Masback initiated a rebranding exercise that resulted in the creation of a new USATF logo and imaging system still used today.  Nike  Masback joined Nike as the Director of Business Affairs for the Global Sports Marketing division in March 2008. In July 2009, he became Central & Eastern Sports Marketing Director in addition to his Business Affairs responsibilities, based out of Nike’s European headquarters in Hilversum, The Netherlands. In the beginning of 2012, he became Nike’s Vice President of Sports Marketing for Greater China, Japan & Global Business Affairs. He works in Nike’s Beaverton, Oregon world headquarters.  Personal life  Masback is married to Sarah Vogelsberg and they have two children, a daughter, Grace, and a son, Britton. The couple met while practicing law in Washington, D.C.

In 1929 he had a lectureship at the University of Cape Town, and then went back to London to teach phonetics in 1930.

L. Kroeber in 1901.

He became fluent in Maidu and accumulated a large body of notes and texts, but only published one article on Maidu phonetics in 1954. His texts and word lists were published in 1966 by William Shipley as \\"Nisenan texts and dictionary\\" (Univ. of California Publications XLVI).

When he finished his studies in the US, the couple returned to Denmark in 1933, where he sought a topic in linguistic on which to work. Discarding the idea of working on languages of the New Guinea or Southeast Asia, colleagues suggested that he study the Danish dialect of Rovsø in Jutland. He worked there in the village of Udby for a year before his wife fell ill and the two had to leave the town collecting documentation and making detailed transcriptions of the local dialect, which came to form part of the Danish dialectological corpus after his death.http://jysk.au.dk/fileadmin/www.jysk.au.dk/historie/centrets_historie/historien/optegnere.pdf During this period he also collaborated with his former mentor Otto Jespersen on a work on English phonology, which however name came to completion.Arne Juul, Hans Frede Nielsen. 1989.

It is played by two teams consisting of anywhere from two to eight players. The object of the game is to throw the ball into the opponents end zone. The game is played on a field that is 100-meters long by 15-meters wide (in the United States yards may be substituted for meters). The Schleuderball itself is a 1.5 kilogram leather ball with an attached strap. The primary throw, called a schleuder, is performed by swinging the ball around by the strap, gaining centrifugal force, and releasing in the direction of the opponent's goal. A different type of throw, called a shock, can be thrown by the player who catches an opponent's throw. The two teams alternate schleuders back and forth until one team gets the ball to land inbounds beyond the opponent's goal line. Ruleshttp://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl;=de&u;=http://www.klv- oldenburg.de/Sport/klv_sport_schleu_text.htm&prev;=/search%3Fq%3Dschleuderball%26hl%3Den%26lr%3Dlang_de%26safe%3Doff&rurl;=translate.google.com&twu;=1&usg;=ALkJrhiuq1M8He8GEUY4QZQw0RFSq-0Ujw The playing field is 100-meters long by 15-meters wide. The first team to throw starts at their own 30-meter line. Their first player throws (or schleuders) the ball by swinging it from the strap and releasing towards the opponent's end of the field. The opposing team waits at their own 30-meter line and cannot advance past it until the first thrower releases the ball. Once the first team releases the ball, the opposing team can move forward to stop its forward progress. If the ball is not caught by the opposing team, then the advancement of the ball ends at either (1) the point at which the ball stops in bounds, (2) the point at which the ball, untouched by the defense, crosses the side boundary line, or (3) the point at which the ball, already touched by the defense, stops out of bounds. The point at which the ball's advancement ends becomes the \\"line of schleuder,\\" and is where the opposing team takes possession. If the ball is caught by the defensive team, then the player who caught the ball can throw the ball forward without using the strap. This throw is called a \\"shock.\\" The point at which the shock is stopped by the original offense is the new line of schleuder for the team who just threw the shock. If a shock throw lands out of bounds, the throw does not count, and the line of schleuder moves back to the point of the catch. The original offense can also catch the shock and throw a return shock the opposite way. This sequence can continue until a maximum of three shocks are thrown. If the third consecutive shock is caught, the throw is voided and the ball is placed at the spot from which the third shock was thrown. The point at which the shock throws stop is the new line of schleuder, and possession transfers to the team who defended the previous schleuder. Each team must maintain a sequential order (like a batting order in baseball) for their schleuders. A player can only throw a schleuder at their set turn. Shocks, on the other hand, are thrown by the player who catches the ball. After a shock is thrown, the schleuder order resumes as normal. Goals are scored by landing the ball in the opponents goal. The goal starts at the end of the 100-meter field, and continues indefinitely. The ball must land within the 15-meter side boundaries. One point is scored when a team lands the ball in the goal on their schleuder. Two points are scored if the ball lands in the goal on a shock, including a return shock after a first shock is caught. This is called a shock-point. Various methods are used to measure the length of a game. The most popular method is to play two halves of fixed times. The team with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner. History The game of Schleuderball originated in Northwest Germany. Scott Seeger, a former German professor at the University of Kansas, is credited with introducing the game to the United States.http://www.wkuherald.com/2008/03/25/schleuderballclubfacesstiffonlycompetition/ The game has been played in the United States at the University of Kansas, Western Kentucky University, Lewis and Clark Law School, Kettering University, and Knoxville, Tennessee. It is also played at Olathe East High School, Olathe South High School, and Olathe Northwest High School in Olathe, Kansas.

It is a Grade I listed building.  History  Most of the church building dates back to the fourteenth century, on the site of an earlier church. The tower was built in the fifteenth century and was used by the Reverend William Derham in the first accurate measurement of the speed of sound. The church was heavily restored in 1858 by Richard Armstrong, and his work was paid for by Richard Benyon of Cranham Hall, a wealthy local landowner. A recent extension to the north side was completed in 2003.  Interior  The pulpit is of Elizabethan appearance, but is more likely to be 17th century. The baptismal font and royal arms (made of Coade stone) were both made in 1842. The reredos behind the altar, depicting the Last Supper, dates to 1879. The numerous monuments are mostly associated with the local Poyntz family. Monumental brasses include one to former vicar Edward Foley Evans, who died in 1933. The main monument is a large stone effigy of Sir Gabriel Poyntz (1538–1608) and his wife Etheldreda, who are lying on a marble tomb chest. Over them is a wooden tester without column supports, decorated with images of the sun, moon, clouds and stars.  Liturgy  North Ockendon Church is notable for its retention of choral Prayer book services, in addition to contemporary Biblical liturgy and a sung Eucharist in modern English.  Music  St. Mary Magdalene's has an established choir which accompanies the weekly choral services in addition to other events. The choir's regular repertoire notably includes a number of largely obscure Victorian compositions. The organ is a 2 manual Brindley & Foster instrument currently in the care of Martin M Cross builders (Grays) and on which the pitch is rather sharp at A=460.  Bells  The tower has a peal of 6 bells hung for change ringing. They are a descending scale in G major. The heaviest bell, the Tenor, weighs approx. 9½ cwt. The bells are rung from the ground floor and, unusually, are hung in an anticlockwise direction.

Life According to postwar interrogations Altgayer was born in Galicia, where his father, a native of Osijek, served as an Austro- Hungarian army cavalry officer. Altgayer grew up in various garrison towns, including Pardubice, Čakovec and Sarajevo. In 1904 his family moved to Kutjevo in Slavonia, where he attended school. He then attended schools in Osijek and Zemun, where he obtained his high school diploma.Mads Ole Balling, Von Reval bis Bukarest - Statistisch-Biographisches Handbuch der Parlamentarier der deutschen Minderheiten in Ostmittel und Südosteuropa 1919-1945, Band 2, 2.

(Kopenhagen 1991); , pages 687-688 He attended the Cavalry Cadet School in Moravia between 1912 and 1915, and then fought during World War I as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army in Russia, Romania and Italy. On 24 August 1915 he was appointed as a Leutnant (lieutenant) and on 17 August 1917 promoted to Oberleutnant (senior lieutenant). Between 16 December 1918 and 28 January 1927, Altgayer served in the army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where he reached the rank of Captain First Class. After leaving the army he worked as a bookkeeper, bank clerk, representative and head of an agricultural cooperative. After 1937 he became involved in Volksdeutsche (ethnic German minority) communal politics. Branimir Altgayer took a lead in the Schwäbisch-Deutschen Kulturbund Jugoslawiens (Swabian-German Cultural Association of Yugoslavia). In 1936 he founded in Osijek the Kultur- und Wohlfahrtsvereinigung der Deutschen (KWVD/Cultural and Welfare Association of Germans). After the pro-Nazi takeover of the German minority political realm in 1939, he was appointed regional head of Slavonia.Valdis O. Lumans, Himmler's Auxiliaries, The Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle and the German Minorities of Europe, 1939-1945 (1993) After the founding of the Ustaše-led Independent State of Croatia (NDH) Altgayer was not initially selected by the Nazis to lead the German minority in the NDH. Rather, power went to Josef Meier who followed guidance from the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VoMi) in Berlin more closely.Anton Scherer, Suevia-Pannonica, (Graz 2009) Altgayer quickly \\"became a chronic source of trouble for VoMi. Due to his popularity with the NDH authorities as well as his German constituents, Altgayer increasingly disregarded VoMi's instructions, especially when he believed that Reich demands conflicted with the best interests of his Volksdeutsche.\\"Valdis O. Lumans, Himmler's Auxiliaries, The Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle and the German Minorities of Europe, 1939-1945 (1993), p. 237. On 6 November 1941 Heinrich Himmler appointed Altagayer an SS-Hauptsturmführer and on 9 November 1943 he was promoted to SS-Sturmbannführer. In 1942, Altgayer was selected as one of two representatives of the German minority in Sabor. In 1943 he was named as secretary to the Ustaše government and responsible for the internal affairs of the German minority. The leader of the NDH, Ante Pavelić, also appointed Altgayer as a reserve colonel in the Ustaše Militia and he was also bestowed with the title \\"Knight\\" (vitez). He served briefly on the German Eastern Front. Postwar After World War II. Altgayer escaped to Austria but was delivered by the British occupying power with others, against an extradition request, from Wolfsberg internment camp to Communist Yugoslavia. He was sentenced in the district court of Zagreb on 21 January 1950 for \\"crimes against the people and state\\" sentenced to death. He filed a petition for mercy in vain and, officially at least, he was executed by firing squad on 15 May, either 1950 or 1951, aged 53 or 54.Mads Ole Balling, Von Reval bis Bukarest - Statistisch-Biographisches Handbuch der Parlamentarier der deutschen Minderheiten in Ostmittel und Südosteuropa 1919-1945, Band 2, 2.

Meyer sets have several equivalent characterizations; they are named after Yves Meyer, who introduced and studied them in the context of diophantine approximation. Nowadays Meyer sets are best known as mathematical model for quasicrystals. However, Meyer's work precedes the discovery of quasicrystals by more than a decade and was entirely motivated by number theoretic questions. .. Definition and characterizations A subset X of a metric space is relatively dense if there exists a number r such that all points of X are within distance r of X, and it is uniformly discrete if there exists a number ε such that no two points of X are within distance ε of each other. A set that is both relatively dense and uniformly discrete is called a Delone set. When X is a subset of a vector space, its Minkowski difference X − X is the set {x − y x, y in X} of differences of pairs of elements of X.Moody gives different definitions for relative density and uniform discreteness, specialized to locally compact groups, but remarks that these definitions coincide with the usual ones for real vector spaces. With these definitions, a Meyer set may be defined as a relatively dense set X for which X − X is uniformly discrete. Equivalently, it is a Delone set for which X − X is Delone, or a Delone set X for which there exists a finite set F with X − X ⊂ X + F, Section 7. Some additional equivalent characterizations involve the set :X^\\\\epsilon = \\\\\\\\{y\\\\mid |x\\\\cdot y - 1\\\\le\\\\varepsilon \\\\text{ for all } x\\\\in X\\\\\\\\} defined for a given X and ε, and approximating (as ε approaches zero) the definition of the reciprocal lattice of a lattice. A relatively dense set X is a Meyer set if and only if * For all ε > 0, Xε is relatively dense, or equivalently * There exists an ε with 0 < ε < 1/2 for which Xε is relatively dense. A character of an additively closed subset of a vector space is a function that maps the set to the unit circle in the plane of complex numbers, such that the sum of any two elements is mapped to the product of their images. A set X is a harmonious set if, for every character χ on the additive closure of X and every ε > 0, there exists a continuous character on the whole space that ε-approximates χ. Then a relatively dense set X is a Meyer set if and only if it is harmonious. Examples Meyer sets include *The points of any lattice *The vertices of any rhombic Penrose tiling, Section 3.2. *The Minkowski sum of another Meyer set with any nonempty finite set *Any relatively dense subset of another Meyer set, Corollary 6.7.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 14, 2010. In the episode, Homer and Marge once again try to discipline Bart after Edna Krabappel tells them that Bart has not been doing his homework, but Bart has a plan to manipulate Homer's strictness and Marge's sympathetic ear, which backfires when Homer and Marge see through the plan and decide to ignore Bart. The episode was written by Brian Kelley and directed by Mark Kirkland. The episode features references to the shows Pokémon, House and The Jetsons. The episode received mostly positive reviews and got an 18-49 Nielsen Rating of 2.6/8. Plot At Springfield Elementary, after Edna Krabappel shows a video from 1956 to her students about the future, she tells her students to turn in their homework project, which they had three months to do. Bart, who had forgotten, tries to make his homework on the fly out of odds and ends found in his desk. A disapproving Edna sends a letter to Homer and Marge informing them Bart is one month behind on his homework. When Homer is informed that he does not have to help Bart with this work; he is eager to increase his son's workload, but Marge is concerned that the heavy workload will dissuade Bart from liking school, unaware that he already hates it. With his parents not agreeing on this issue, Bart uses their opposing views to avoid homework entirely, creating a wedge issue that sharply divides them both. As the arguments continue, Bart even incites them to argue about very minor things that do not even involve his homework. Marge seeks advice from Ned Flanders, who recalls having a minor argument with Maude on the day she died which still haunts him. Marge also counsels Patty and Selma, who, eager to break up Marge and Homer, encourage her to \\"stick to her guns\\" so she will be happier without Homer. However, knowing how her sisters feel about Homer, Marge thinks about how her life could end up like theirs and immediately heads out to make things right with her husband. Meanwhile, Homer falls asleep at work, dreams about accidentally killing Marge and realizes that he too wants to apologize. The two spot each other in traffic, rush out of their cars and embrace. They then decide to let Bart fend for himself, leaving him stunned when they pay no attention to any of his antics. When Bart confesses to Nelson he no longer feels thrilled when he plays pranks, Nelson suggests Bart receives no gratification from pranks unless someone loses their temper. Bart then decides to destroy Springfield Elementary, which has recently been damaged by a subway tremor he and Milhouse caused on the town via the subway tracks, by driving a train under it. Homer and Marge find a note from Lisa informing them of this prank, and they decide to take immediate action. They rush to the subway station, where Homer tries to push the emergency kill switch. It is stuck, but Homer then imagines that the switch is Bart, pretends to be strangling him, and he succeeds in stopping the subway. Skinner is relieved when he realizes the school is saved, and he puts a flag up. However, the flagpole falls against the already damaged building, causing it to collapse, much to Nelson and Edna's delight. Bart is therefore grounded and forced to finish his homework and tweet Homer about his current activities, and his parents begin to keep their son in line again. Lisa confronts Bart upon discovering he had written the note from her because it misspells the word \\"Elementary\\", but promises to keep it a secret, much to his relief. Reception Ratings In the original American broadcast, \\"Postcards from the Wedge\\" was viewed by 5.23 million viewers and got an 18-49 Nielsen rating of 2.6/8 coming second in its timeslot after The Amazing Race making it the third most viewed show on Fox that night after a new episode of Family Guy and a rerun of \\"The Great Wife Hope\\", but the second highest rated show on FOX that night after Family Guy.\\" Critical reception The episode received positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8, stating the episode was \\"outstanding\\" and that \\"Again, the story was nothing entirely new, but the jokes were smart and fun and worth sitting on the couch for a half- hour.\\". Ariel Ponywether of FireFox News gave the episode a B- and said that \\"There were some very solid moments in this episode, with some surprisingly subversive humor throughout, and the final scene was a real winner. The middle stretch slows down the episode’s pacing a bit.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and stated \\"I don't think the plotting here was as tight as it might have been - lots of threads were introduced and then mostly left dangling, and the end was particularly abrupt - but I laughed fairly frequently, and that will be enough\\". Jason Hughes of TV Squad said that \\"All in all, while it was an unexpectedly serious episode, it was a pleasant enough one as well. No big guffaws, but enough smiles to go around.\\" The episode won the Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation, for Charles Ragins' Background Design.

The son of the admiral Sir Errol Manners, he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932 to 1958. He served in the Second World War and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the Distinguished Service Cross for his role in the sinking of the German submarine U-1274 in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard . As a first-class cricketer, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He began his playing career with Hampshire in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at Sandhurst. He played county cricket for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the Combined Services cricket team. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries. In September 2018, he became the longest-lived first-class cricketer, surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by Jim Hutchinson, having been the oldest living first-class cricketer since September 2014. Early life The son of the Royal Navy admiral and theologian Sir Errol Manners (1883-1953) and his wife, Florence Maud Harrison (1883-1967), he was born in Exeter in September 1914. He was descended from John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland. He was educated at Ferndown School, before attending Britannia Royal Naval College as a cadet from the age of 13, following in a family tradition of attending the college. His time as a cadet saw him visit the West Indies and appear for the college in the schools' match at Lord's in 1930. Early naval and cricket career Manners was commissioned as a midshipman in the Royal Navy in September 1932, before being made an acting-sub-lieutenant in January 1935. In September of the same year, he was promoted to the rank in full. He played cricket for the United Services in 1935, against a strong Hampshire Club & Ground side, scoring 20 runs and taking four wickets. Manners served aboard the royal yacht Victoria and Albert at Portsmouth in 1936, though with King Edward unwilling to travel to Cowes, this left Manners with more shore time. He played for the Royal Navy as captain against the British Army cricket team in a two-day match at Lord's in July of that year, where he scored 23 and 47, impressing Christopher Heseltine, then president of Hampshire County Cricket Club, who recommended to Manners that he play for the county. He was allowed by the navy to play for Hampshire in August, making his debut in first-class cricket against Gloucestershire at the United Services Ground in the County Championship, scoring 81 runs in his first innings before he was dismissed by Reg Sinfield and thus narrowly falling short of becoming the first Hampshire batsman to make a century on their first-class debut. In the fortnight following this match, he made four further first-class appearances, scoring 212 runs at an average of 35.33. He headed Hampshire's batting averages in 1936 and sufficiently impressed future Test Match Special commentator John Arlott with his strokeplay. As an amateur his cricket after 1936 was heavily curtailed by his commitments with the navy. In December 1937, he was promoted to lieutenant, with seniority antedated to July of that year. From 1937, he served aboard aboard torpedo boats in the Mediterranean and the Far East. Prior to the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, Manners had been saving his leave in order to have a full summer playing county cricket in 1940, but the subsequent declaration would mean it would be more than ten years before he played first-class cricket again. Second World War service Manners was assigned to the under-construction in 1940. Prior to war being declared, Manners was serving as a watch-keeping officer aboard at China Station in Hong Kong. With war looking likely Birmingham sailed for Singapore, where she patrolled the Sunda Strait. When war was declared, Birmingham left for Japan, but did not enter its territorial waters. Manners was recalled back to Britain in December 1939 aboard and the troop liner .Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 6 Returning to Southampton in early January 1940, Manners spent a month on leave at the family home at Alverstoke,Yardley-Latham 2010, pp. 5-6 before being assigned to the destroyer which was under construction at the Walker Yard on the Tyne in Newcastle. Manners was not one of the officers based at Newcastle to be sent to assist with the Dunkirk evacuation and spent the summer escorting convoys down the east coast following the Eglinton's commissioning. While at Newcastle, he met Mary Downes (1917–1995), an actress with the Newcastle Repertory Company. The couple married in October 1940 at Marylebone and narrowly avoided being killed on their wedding night when a German bomb hit the Hyde Park Hotel when they were in its restaurant, but failed to detonate. It was reported at the time to have been the second largest unexploded German bomb to have been recovered during the Blitz.Yardley-Latham 2010, pp. 9, 12-13 In the same month, Eglinton was chosen to take part in Operation Lucid, a plan to use fire ships to attack German invasion barges in ports in German-occupied northern France, however while escorting an oil tanker to Boulogne the operation command ship struck a mine, resulting in the cancellation of the operation.Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 14 Six months later, with Eglinton based at Harwich, Manner's and his wife again avoided death under similar circumstances, when their rented house was hit by a bomb while they were in the bathroom; although unscathed, four other occupants of the house were killed. Manners served as a lieutenant aboard Eglinton until February 1942, after which he held a brief command aboard which was being repaired at Chatham. After a few weeks commanding Fame, Manners was sent to at Falmouth, after her first lieutenant had fallen overboard and drowned.Yardley-Latham 2010, pp. 18-19 He served aboard Eskimo in Operation Harpoon during the Siege of Malta in June 1942,Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 20 subsequently seeing action in the relief of Malta, for which he was later mentioned in dispatches. In September 1942, Eskimo formed part of Convoy PQ 18 escorting supply ships in the Arctic on their way to the Soviet Union, before returning to the Mediterranean to take part in the Operation Torch landings.Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 60 Manners was made commanding officer of Eskimo in May 1943, with the ship taking part in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, during which she was bombed and severely damaged. Manners was commanding officer aboard from 1943–45. He took command of the destroyer in December 1943, while she was being refitted at Jarrow. After a few weeks aboard Viceroy, Manners was seconded to at Derry, after her captain had fallen ill and an officer with experience was required to replace him. He returned to command Viceroy after six weeks. Forming part of the Rosyth Escort Force as an anti-aircraft and anti-E-boat escort to convoys in the North Sea which were carrying supplies from the Firth of Forth to London, Viceroy was escorting a convoy on 11 April 1945, when the tanker which was carrying of molasses was hit by a torpedo from the German submarine U-1274 near the Farne Islands, causing two explosions to rock the ship. Realising the convoy was under attack from a U-boat, and that the water was too deep for mines, he turned the ship to port and took off in pursuit, obtaining a contact at . Manners commanded an urgent attack with depth charges set to “shallow”, the explosion of which temporarily knocked out the electrics aboard Viceroy. Ten minutes later power was restored and a second attack on the U-boat was made, which brought oil to the surface. Reckoning that the U-boat had been sunk at a depth of , a third depth-charge set to “deep”, which caused a prolonged explosion and brought more oil to the surface. Two weeks later the kill was confirmed and Manners returned to the scene of the sinking with Eskimo and , recovering twelve bottles of brandy which he sent to Winston Churchill, for which Churchill conveyed his thanks and congratulations on the successful attack. His actions in the sinking saw him mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. As the war neared its conclusion, Manners took part in Operation Conan, the Royal Navy's contribution to the liberation of Norway following the formal German surrender at Oslo in May 1945. He was the British naval officer in charge in Trondheim, where he received the German surrender there and entertained Crown Prince Olav aboard Viceroy. Having been an acting lieutenant commander since May 1945, he achieved the war-substantive rank in July 1945. Later career and return to cricket Upon leaving Viceroy in July 1945, Manners was assigned to the troop ship for its voyage to Australia, where he was to be loaned to the Royal Australian Navy. When the ship arrived in Australia, which was the birthplace of his mother, it docked at Melbourne and shortly thereafter Manners sailed for Sydney, with him describing his stay there as one of the dullest periods of his life. With no prospect of being assigned aboard a ship, he flew back to Melbourne aboard a Royal Air Force Dakota, where his uncle found him work at a sheep station in the Western District of Victoria.Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 118 After a fortnight at the sheep station, Manners received a phonecall and was assigned to in October 1945, after her first lieutenant had been court-martialled and commander relieved of his duties.Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 121 The ship spent the majority of the next two months in dry dock at Sydney, during which Manners entertained himself by playing in cricket matches against Sydney's leading public schools, including Cranbrook School whose headmaster was the Oxford Blue Brian Hone.Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 122 He remained aboard King George V until May 1946. first-class century in 1947 for Hampshire against Kent at the St Lawrence Ground (pictured in 2017). Returning to England, he was appointed the naval liaison officer at Sandhurst, which allowed him to resume playing county cricket. He played his first first-class match since 1936 when he played for the Combined Services cricket team against Gloucestershire at Bristol in 1947. His first match back for Hampshire saw him score his maiden first-class century with 121 at almost a run a ball against Kent at Canterbury. Wisden described the innings as “perfect stroke play, drives, cuts and hooks”. He played three further first-class matches for Hampshire in the 1948 County Championship, in addition to playing for the Combined Services against Hampshire and Gloucestershire in that same year. Against Gloucestershire, he recorded what would be his highest first-class score of 147. His commitments as an officer still limited his availability for Hampshire, with Manners not playing for the county after 1948. He did continue to play first-class matches for the Combined Services until 1953, making twelve appearances. He made 123 against the touring New Zealanders at Gillingham in 1949, and scored 75 against the touring South Africans in 1950. Manners also appeared for the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Free Foresters in a first-class match apiece for each in 1953. He returned to sea in 1953, ending his first-class playing days, before retiring from the navy with the rank of lieutenant commander in April 1958 to become the bursar at Dauntsey's School in Wiltshire.Stephen Chalke, The Way It Was: Glimpses of English Cricket's Past, Fairfield Books, Bath, 2011, pp. 264-65. His time at Dauntsey's was not without controversy, when in 1964 he was temporarily suspended after pupils organised a strike to protest the food they were being served. However, he was reinstated after a week following a letter of support, signed by all but one of the teaching staff. He retired after eighteen years at Dauntsey's. He was a photographer who contributed to Country Life and had an interest in crafts, for which he was the author of the books Country Crafts Today (1974), Country Crafts in Pictures (1976), Crafts of the Highlands and Islands (1978), and Irish Crafts and Craftsmen (1982). His collection of rural photographs and research files are held at the Museum of English Rural Life at the University of Reading. Later life and death His wife, with whom he had a son and two daughters, died in April 1995. He was invited to the Russian Embassy in London in 2014, where he was decorated with the Medal of Ushakov for his service in the Arctic convoys. In September 2017, at the age of 103, Manners took part in the ITV documentary 100 Year Old Driving School, but gave up driving after his appearance. The documentary also featured the England women's Test cricketer Eileen Whelan, who is the oldest living women's cricketer. Shortly after this he suffered a fall and injured his shoulder, which stopped him from visiting his daughter, Diana, who had emigrated to Australia and who Manners would visit each Christmas. In September 2018, he became the longest-lived first-class cricketer, surpassing Jim Hutchinson's (1896–2000) record of 103 years and 344 days. Paying tribute, Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove said: \\"Everyone involved in Hampshire Cricket, past and present, salutes John Manners for his terrific innings and hopes that he holds the record as the oldest living first-class cricketer for a very long time.\\" In November 2019, Manners was presented with a commemorative medal by the Norwegian Defence Attaché John Andreas Olsen for his role as British naval officer in charge of Trondheim during the German surrender in 1945. Manners died on 7 March 2020 at the age of 105 at the Bupa Bayford House nursing home in Newbury, Berkshire. He was survived by three children, eight grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished, it was demolished but its name is preserved in the street name.  Location  Eccles (pop. 36,600) is a town in the City of Salford, a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester in North West England, west of Salford and west of Manchester city centre. Historically a part of Lancashire, Eccles lies on sloping ground between the M602 motorway (to the north), and the Manchester Ship Canal (to the south). The town is served by the Bridgewater Canal and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Monton Mill was situated on the west bank the Bridgewater Canal, north of the railway line.  History  The parish of Eccles contained the townships of Barton-upon-Irwell, Clifton, Pendlebury, Pendleton, and Worsley. Toward the end of the Middle Ages the parish had an estimated population of about 4,000 Communicants. Agriculture remained an important local industry, with little change from the medieval system due to a lack of adequate drainage and fertiliser. Local cottage industries included blacksmiths, butchers, thatching, basket weaving, skinning, and tanning. Weaving was popular, using linen and wool. Merchants traded in corn, and badgers bought and sold local produce. During the 18th century the predominance of textiles in the region is partly demonstrated in the parish registers of 1807, which show that 46 children were baptised with 34 fathers employed as weavers. During the early 19th century the growth of industry meant the majority of the area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture. The factory system was also introduced; in 1835 1,124 people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used power looms. Local hand-produced specialities included striped cotton ticks, checks, Nankeens, and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 Ordnance Survey map of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of silk, with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft. The engine of growth in the second half of the 19th century was the joint stock company, whereby capital could be raised for the construction of new mills. The first joint stock boom was in the early 1860s and the final boom, between 1904 and 1910 produced dozen of mills designed by the same firms of Oldham architects. Monton Mill was built in 1906, a typical mill of this period. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914–18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Monton Mill, Eccles was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950.  Architecture   Power  It was driven by a 1400 hp inverted vertical cross compound engine by George Saxon & Co of Openshaw, built in 1906. The cylinders, 27\\"HP, 56\\"LP had a 4-foot stroke. It was steamed at 160psi by four Lancashire boilers supplied by Galloways.The Engineer, 23 July 1909, p. 94 The 22-foot flywheel ran at 75rpm.  Equipment  The mill was furnished with 91,680 mule spindles, divided into 26,784 twist spindles and 64,896 weft spindles, producing medium counts of average 32's twist and 42's weft. Most of the textile machinery was supplied by Platt Brothers and Co, of Oldham.

In 2008, Nguyen released his first book of photography titled Adventures in Tornado Alley: The Storm Chasers with co-author Mike Hollingshead.  Early life and education  Eric Michael Isbell (last name changed to Nguyen after marriage) was born in Newport Beach, California near Los Angeles, California in 1978 and raised in Keller, Texas after his parents relocated soon after his birth. Eric was strongly interested in severe storms and tornadoes as a child and became heavily intrigued with mobile instrumentation systems for weather data collection. Eric began studying meteorology at the University of Oklahoma (OU) in 2001. He graduated with a B.S. degree in meteorology in May 2005.  Career  In 1994, Nguyen began chasing storms in Texas and soon expanded his range to the larger area of the central United States commonly known as Tornado Alley. Nguyen began publishing images regularly in Accord Publishing's popular annual Weather Guide Calendar series, Smithsonian Magazine, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, as well as Weatherwise, Storm Track, UCAR Quarterly, textbooks, and other venues. His Mulvane, Kansas image of white tornado with a rainbow is one of the most frequently licensed tornado images of all time and several other of his photos have appeared in publications and presentations around the world. Nguyen's storm and tornado photography was considered among the most expressive in the field, with a particular emphasis on unusual palettes and the use of foreground elements to create dynamic line structures in the composition. On April 21, 2007, Nguyen and his storm chasing partner, Amos Magliocco, were struck by a tornado in Tulia, Texas. Nguyen's scientific grade weather instrumentation survived the hit and arguably measured the sharpest pressure fall ever recorded on Earth. Upon his death, hundreds of weather enthusiasts from around the world praised Nguyen's skills as a photographer and chaser in the online journal Storm Track The University of Oklahoma hosted a memorial tribute ceremony in the National Weather Center (NWC) on September 22, 2007. The keynote speaker was Dr. Charles A. Doswell III. An endowed scholarship for graduate and undergraduate meteorology students was created in Nguyen's name at OU's prestigious School of Meteorology (SoM). Nguyen's imagery is represented by the stock photo agency Corbis Int'l which notes that the Mulvane, Kansas tornado image is \\"Widely considered among stormchasers as the greatest tornado photo of all time...\\" A five-week exhibition of Nguyen's photography was held at the Todd/Browning Gallery in Los Angeles from March 15-April 23.  Death  Nguyen died in Arlington, Texas on September 9, 2007 as a result of injuries sustained during a suicide attempt on August 27, 2007. Nguyen suffered a sudden relapse of a mental illness and experienced severe negative reactions to anti-depressant medication.  Publications  Nguyen authored and coauthored scientific publications and conference papers as well as the photography book, Adventures in Tornado Alley: The Storm Chasers.

Though initially received with critical acclaim, the sonata has struggled to maintain a solid position in the modern repertoire.Dmitri N Nikolov, \\"Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Grand Sonata in G major, Op. 37: A critical reevaluation\\" (January 1, 2003). ETD collection for University of Nebraska http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/dissertations/AAI3117803/> Nevertheless, the sonata has been recorded numerous times and is recognized as one of the composer's masterworks. It is dedicated to Karl Klindworth.  History  The sonata was composed at Clarens and Kamenka between March and April 1878, around the same time as the famous Violin Concerto in D.Tchaikovsky Research, \\"Grand Sonata\\". November 6th, 2013. In a letter to his younger brother Anatolii, Tchaikovsky complains about the difficulties he faced in writing his sonata: When Tchaikovsky's violinist friend Iosif Kotek arrived at Clarens, the composer's efforts quickly became focused on his Violin Concerto, and work on the sonata was discontinued.Letter 778 to Nadezdha von Meck, 5/17 March 1878. He resumed work on the sonata in mid-April and completed it before the month's end. It was premiered in a concert of the Russian Musical Society by pianist Nikolai Rubinstein, much to the composer's delight: The work was later performed by Rubinstein again, and was met with great critical acclaim.Letter 1320 to Nadezdha von Meck, 21 October/2 November – 22 October/3 November 1879. It was first published by P. Jurgenson in 1879.  Movements  The work is in an expanded four-movement form, and is distinctly symphonic in character: #Moderato e risoluto (G major) #Andante non troppo quasi Moderato (E minor) #Scherzo. Allegro giocoso (G major) #Finale. Allegro vivace (G major) Structurally, the four movements are connected by the 'Grand Motif' introduced in the first movement, though it is expressed in a variety of contexts. The first movement is written in common sonata-allegro form, and an array of techniques are used to mimic orchestral colors. The themes presented are undoubtedly Russian, but the composer's strict observance of Western musical tradition is still prevalent. The second movement is a melancholy Andante which lends itself to Tchaikovsky's natural gift for lyricism. It is considerably longer than the two movements that follow it. The third movement is a brief, fast-paced Scherzo, and foreshadows some of the techniques later used by Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alexander Scriabin, mainly in its melodic direction. The fourth and final movement is a galloping Allegro that is very much characteristic of Tchaikovsky's musical style. After sections of difficult passage-work, the sonata closes with an exuberant coda. The average playing time is about 31 minutes.

It was spun off from the Dodge marque, using the name of the Ram Pickup line of trucks. Ram Trucks' logo was originally used as Dodge's logo. Ram \\"Classic\\" trucks are made at the Warren Truck Plant in Warren, Michigan and at the Saltillo plant in Saltillo, Mexico. New series Ram pickups are made at Sterling Heights Assembly in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Background Prior to the 1970s, Dodge had maintained a separate marque for trucks, Fargo Trucks, primarily for use outside the United States. After that point, all trucks made by Chrysler were distributed under the Dodge marque. Ram Trucks was established as a division of Chrysler in 2010, as a spin-off from Dodge, and using the name of the Dodge Ram line of pickups that is now sold under the Ram banner. According to Chrysler, the Ram Trucks brand will concentrate on \\"real truck customers\\", rather than casual truck buyers who buy trucks for image or style. The Ram brand was created following Chrysler's acquisition by Italian automaker Fiat, and the plans called for Dodge switching to an exclusively car-based lineup with all pickup and future heavy-duty trucks by Chrysler being sold under the Ram brand. This started in the 2009 calendar year. The Fiat Ducato cargo van design has been adopted and is sold as the Ram ProMaster in North American markets, filling the gap created when Daimler ended production of the Dodge Sprinter in 2008. The goal was to increase truck sales \\"from today's 280,000 to 415,000 by 2014\\". Executives at Chrysler have stated their intention to compete in the semi-trailer truck category with Ram, a possibility that is aided by Fiat's ownership of Iveco and an already available network of Dodge dealers. Even though the Ram trucks are marketed separately from Dodge cars, former Ram Division President Fred Diaz stated, \\"Ram trucks are not a Dodge model. Ram will always be 'vinned' (Vehicle Identification Number) as a Ram. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers. The two should have distinct themes.\\" In April 2013, former CEO Fred Diaz left RAM to serve as vice president of Nissan's divisional sales and marketing. He was replaced by Reid Bigland. In August 2014, Ram truck brand CEO Reid Bigland was tapped to lead the Alfa Romeo brand in North America. It was announced that the new head of the Ram Trucks brand would be longtime Chrysler employee Robert Hegbloom, who joined Chrysler in 1986 and had previously been a director for the Dodge brand. In October 2018, Bigland was promoted to CEO of Ram Trucks. Shortly thereafter, he discovered that the division had been misreporting sales figures, and turned over that information to the US government for investigation. Allegedly FCA cut his bonuses in retaliation, which resulted in Bigland filing a whistleblower lawsuit against FCA. In March 2020 Bigland announced that he was resigning his position. The Ram brand logo features the head of a ram, formerly the logo used by Dodge. Trucks For specifically foreign-market models (designed by Chrysler Europe, etc.), see below. From 1927 to 1928, all trucks built by Dodge were actually sold under the Graham name, as that company held the marketing rights at that time.

In popular culture *Ram Trucks entered popular culture in an unintentional way on February 4, 2018 during Super Bowl LII. Their commercial's use of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s sermon \\"The Drum Major Instinct\\" was quickly and widely panned by audiences, academics, news outlets and social media alike. Of particular concern was its usage of a speech in which King condemned advertising (\\"we are so often taken by advertisers... those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion\\"), to sell more Ram Trucks. Within hours content creators on YouTube had made spin-offs (\\"What Martin Luther King Actually Thought About Car Commercials\\", \\"The MLK Super Bowl Ad Dodge Didn't Show You\\", \\"What Dodge LEFT OUT Of Their MLK Commercial In Super Bowl\\" etc.) which showed a more accurate perspective of King's sermon and opinions about advertising.

Entered into the 13th Berlin International Film Festival, it also won the Prix Louis Delluc. Set in Istanbul, it tells the story of a withdrawn man falling hopelessly in love with an attractive and sexy woman who will not reveal her identity. While the two speak French to each other, the other characters mostly speak unsubtitled Turkish. Using a non-linear structure, intercut with memories and fantasies, neither the characters nor the viewers can be sure of what is portrayed and must reach their own understanding. Plot Having taken a job in Istanbul, a melancholy Frenchman rents a flat overlooking the Bosphorus. He sets out to explore the city but, as he speaks only French, cannot communicate. He meets a beautiful and mysterious woman in a white convertible who speaks French as well as Turkish and is prepared to show him around. She is also ready to start a discreet affair. While they take in the sights of the city, often in deserted ruins and graveyards, they tend to be shadowed by sinister-looking men with one or more ferocious dogs. Then the woman disappears, and the Frenchman's obsession with her grows. Hunting for her all over, he finds the locals unhelpful, until he sees her one night in a crowded street. She rushes him away in her car, only to crash it as she tries to avoid one of the shadowing dogs. The Frenchman is scarcely harmed, but the woman is dead. Still obsessed with her memory, he starts a new quest to find out who she was, one possibility being a high-class prostitute. Once her car has been repaired, he buys it and crashes it on the same road, dying as well. Production Alain Robbe-Grillet, who was one of the most successful screenwriters of the French New Wave, longed to direct a feature film, but no offers of backing were forthcoming. At length, a Belgian producer agreed to let him direct a film from his own screenplay, on condition that the film be shot in Turkey, using \\"blocked funds\\" (profits from an earlier film that could not be taken out of the country) owed to Cocinor, the French production company. Robbe-Grillet accepted this, and in his first feature film as a director, created a dreamlike, erotic fantasy. Robbe-Grillet wrote a very detailed plan for the shooting, and wanted it followed in every detail. Both Françoise Brion and Jacques Doniol-Valcroze were friends of the director; though he had written the scenario with other actors in mind, he decided on them instead.Brion, F.

Thus, the film was almost impossible to see. However, in January 2014, the British Film Institute announced the DVD and Blu-ray release of the film, along with five other Robbe-Grillet features, as part of the box set Alain Robbe-Grillet: Six Films 1964-1974, scheduled to be released in the UK on 23 June 2014. Some of the individual titles were released in the US by Redemption in February 2014. L'Immortelle and the other films were also included in the French DVD box set Alain Robbe-Grillet - Récits cinématographiques, released in France in 2013. Dino de Laurentiis acquired the Italian distribution rights after production, and officially, in the film's credits, L'Immortelle is listed as a French/Italian co-production, although it was shot entirely in and around Istanbul, with a mostly Turkish crew.

He was introduced in the fourth season as a recurring character. He evolves from being a surgical attending physician to Chief of Staff at Chicago's County General Hospital, with McCrane being promoted to series regular from the sixth season until the tenth season.Season 10, Episode 8, \\"Freefall\\". Known for his sarcastic and nasty comments, Romano provides an antagonistic force during his time in the series. Development Romano was a recurring character during the fourth and fifth seasons of the series. He became a regular character during the sixth-season premiere. In a script from the sixth season, Romano is described as having \\"no soul\\". In an interview with the Orlando Sentinel, McCrane discussed the sequence in which Romano loses his arm in a helicopter accident during the ninth season premiere. McCrane explained: \\"In terms of my action, I stood up, continuing a motion of having picked up this chart that fell on the tarmac. I swung my arm up and was yanked back by a cable [...] and at whatever point would have been accurate, when my arm was on its way up, they painted in the dismembered part flying up and off camera.\\" McCrane's arm was hidden while there was a prothesis fitted over his shoulder. According to The New York Times, it took McCrane just 20 minutes to shoot, but digitally creating and animating the helicopter, the blood, the wind and the Chicago skyline took the Stargate team a full week. The character was killed off halfway through the tenth season. McCrane was disappointed by the producers' decision, but knew his character \\"had run its course\\". Producer Chris Chulack went on by stating \\"Even a horrific helicopter accident last season - in which his arm was severed, ending his career as a surgeon - could not curtail his inappropriate, sarcastic remarks. There wasn't much to be done.\\" After McCrane left the main cast of ER, he went on to direct multiple episodes of the series along with Laura Innes after her departure in Season 13. Character history Romano is introduced in the fourth season's episode \\"Good Touch, Bad Touch\\" as a surgical attending sponsoring Elizabeth Corday's internship in the Chicago ER. Romano is a brilliant surgeon, but does not get along with the majority of the staff, except for Corday whose early quarreling and professional setbacks at Romano's hands such as discontinuing her fellowship had blossomed into a respected friendship over the years. He is portrayed as obnoxious and ambitious, and is eager to jump at the job of interim ER Chief to help weasel his way toward the top of the administrative ladder. In the fifth season, Dr. Maggie Doyle accuses Dr. Romano of sexual harassment and when she asks Elizabeth to back up her claims, she decides not to after Romano blackmails Elizabeth about her relationship with Dr. Peter Benton. Romano becomes the Acting ER Chief when Dr. Donald Anspaugh mentions he cannot cope with being the Acting Chief as well as his other jobs much to the dismay of the ER staff. The character is promoted to series regular in the sixth season. He is hired as the new Chief of Staff, much to the dismay of the entire staff, but it was good news for Elizabeth because he promoted her to Associate Chief of Surgery. Kerry Weaver had originally backed him up for the job, backstabbing Mark Greene in the process and earning the permanent ER Chief position, but soon becomes disgusted with him after seeing his diabolical ways which included him suspending her later in the season after she treated a comatose, brain-damaged young woman without HMO approval. He starts to grow fond of medical student Lucy Knight after she convinces him to do a heart operation on a patient on Christmas Eve.Season 6, Episode 9, \\"How the Finch Stole Christmas\\". He, along with Elizabeth, treats Lucy after she is brutally stabbed by a schizophrenic patient. When Lucy dies despite their feverish work to save her, he angrily throws a surgical tray in his grief and, later in the episode, is found by Weaver closing Lucy's chest incision by himself.Season 6, Episode 14, \\"All in the Family\\". In the seventh season, when Benton arranges for the surgery of a Medicare patient over Romano's objections, Romano fires Benton and then blacklists him throughout the community, making it almost impossible for him to find a job in Chicago which forced Benton to come back and accept a daily call, no-benefits job from Romano. After Benton impresses Romano by keeping his mouth shut and doing the job, Romano \\"rewards\\" him with a raise and benefits but also manipulates him into taking on a new post related to affirmative action at County (but is then outmaneuvered when Benton gets a talented African-American student a previously-denied interview, and the student is then accepted into medical school). In addition, Romano stops at nothing to fire Dr. Kim Legaspi, a psychiatric attending and love interest of Weaver. The two both realize that she was being discriminated against for her homosexuality by Romano and Kerry came out of the closet to Romano when announcing she would defend Kim. In \\"Survival of the Fittest,\\" a pregnant Elizabeth performs a grueling surgery just to prove to Romano that she can. To Elizabeth's surprise, Romano has dinner delivered to the hospital for her afterwards in an unexpected but genuine gesture of kindness. In the next season, Kim moves to San Francisco and Romano surprisingly decides to keep Kerry's secret. Romano continues to be arrogant and insensitive throughout the season, but surprisingly shows a soft side when Elizabeth has a hard time with Mark Greene's decision to discontinue his brain cancer treatment. In the first episode of season nine, Romano, Luka Kovac, and Susan Lewis are evacuating the hospital due to a Monkey Pox outbreak. While they are on the helipad to load a patient onto a waiting helicopter, the wind blows the chart off the gurney; when Romano moves to retrieve it, the helicopter rotor severs his arm. Lewis and Kovac rush to save his life.Season 9, Episode 1, \\"Chaos Theory\\". Although they manage to reattach the arm, Romano begins to lose motion and sensation in it. He is later removed from his Chief of Staff position by Dr. Anspaugh. Weaver takes over and offers Romano the position of Chief of the ER. During that time, he fires senior nurses Lydia Wright, Conni Oligario, and Yosh Takata. Towards the end of the season, Romano suffers severe burns to his arm without feeling them, prompting him to decide to have it amputated. In the tenth season, Romano gets a robotic arm. He dies in the episode \\"Free Fall\\" from a helicopter that falls off the roof and crushes him. Before the helicopter fell, he was going to lodge a complaint on Dr. Greg Pratt and caught Dr. Archie Morris smoking pot. He leaves a large amount of money to the hospital in his will, which Weaver uses to fund a gay and lesbian medical program. In \\"Missing,\\" Elizabeth tries to organize a memorial for Romano, but finds that she's the only person that actually misses him. A plaque honoring Romano is mounted on the wall between the two main elevators, then later taken down and put into storage after a shootout in the ER. Romano reappears in the final season in a flashback, talking with Dr. Greene by Trauma 1 about his chemotherapy.Season 15, Episode 7, \\"Heal Thyself\\". In the episode \\"The Book of Abby,\\" long-serving nurse Haleh Adams showed Abby Lockhart the Wall of Doctors and on there, the tag \\"Romano\\" can be seen. Reception In his book Writing for Visual Media, author Anthony Friedmann calls Romano a \\"mocking, sarcastic, nasty guy.\\" Romano is described as a \\"boss from hell\\" by Stephen Battaglio in Los Angeles Times, while he was reviewing the characters' death. Romano's death was described by Michael Ausiello as \\"shocking\\" and as if it was \\"ripped straight from The Wizard of Oz\\", and calls Romano \\"County General's very own Wicked Physician.\\" In a review several years later for NJ.com, Alan Sepinwall called Romano's death \\"one of the silliest moments in ER history.\\" References External links *Official NBC Character Bio Category:ER (TV series) characters Category:Fictional amputees Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 ","title":"Robert Romano (ER)"},{"id":"26194970","text":"Vondo Dam is an earth-fill type dam located on the Mutshindudi River near Sibasa, Limpopo, South Africa.

Colijn de Coter (c. 1440–1445 – c. 1522–1532) was an early Netherlandish painter who produced mainly altarpieces. He worked primarily in Brussels and Antwerp. His name was sometimes given as Colijn van Brusele (Colijn of Brussels), indicating that he hailed from Brussels or at the least lived there most of his active life. He also signed several paintings with Coliin de Coter pinxit me in Brabancia Bruselle (\\"Colijn de Coter painted me in Brussels in the region of Brabant\\"). De Coter was born around 1440–1445. This can be deduced from a 1479 document in the Brussels archives, naming him as a husband, painter and tenant of a house; in other words, he must have already reached adulthood in that year. Another document, dating from 1483, refers to him as Colijn van Brusele (Colijn of Brussels). This document states that he had registered with the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp and decorated a vault in the chapel of that guild in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp. The archives of the Brussels Brotherhood of Saint Eloy list three payments to Colijn de Coter in 1509–1511 for painting a church tabernacle. From the archives of this brotherhood, we can also deduce that the painter's death probably fell somewhere in the period 1522–1532. Although unproven, art historians believe Colijn de Coter headed an influential workshop with a number of pupils. This conclusion is based on the diversity in style and quality of the work attributed to him. The Leiden painter Cornelis Engebrechtsz. may have been one of his pupils. Contracts survive for two lost works by de Coter one dated 1493 for the decoration of a vault of a chapel and the other dated 1509–10 for the commission for the church tabernacle mentioned above. While the dates of these documents mark the known boundaries of his active period, his surviving work shows that this period more likely spanned from the years 1480 to 1525. Three signed paintings are known: St Luke Painting the Virgin in the parish church of Vieure, Cosne d’Allier, the altarpiece of the Trinity (Paris, Louvre) and the Virgin Crowned by Angels (Düsseldorf, private collection). These works are the basis for the attributions of other works to this artist.Colijn de Coter in The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art in Oxford Reference Works Saint John the Evangelist Weeping Some paintings attributed to Colijn de Coter are: * Saint Lucas painting the Holy Virgin (1493) at the Church of St. Louis in Vieure (France).

It is in the Uffizi gallery in Florence, Italy. History There is no documentation about the commission and the original location of the work, which is known to have been part of the Austrian Imperial collections in Vienna in the 18th century. In 1793 the director of the Uffizi, Luigi Lanzi, exchanged it with another work in order to improve the Venetian Renaissance presence in the museum. At the time, it was attributed to Giorgione. The Italian art historian Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle was the first to identify it as a Bellini. Today his attribution is widely recognized, although another name sometimes mentioned is that of Marco Basaiti. Description The scene is set on a wide terrace with a polychrome marble pavement, in perspective, separated from a lake shore by a parapet. On the left Mary is enthroned, under a baldachin whose support is in cornucopia shape, a symbol of her fertility. The baldachin has four steps, and on its side is a frieze with scenes of the myth of Marsyas, interpreted as a parallel with Jesus' Passion. Near to Mary are two unidentified female figures, which could represent two saints or two virtues. One of them looks to be floating in the air, although the effect could stem from a loss of color near her legs and feet. In the middle of the scene are four children playing with a small tree and its silver fruits, perhaps a symbol of the knowledge tree, a symbol of life and wisdom. On the right are Job and St. Sebastian. Outside the parapet, are St. Joseph (or St. Peter) and St. Paul, the latter with his attribute of a sword. He is advancing to the left, where a man with a turban perhaps symbolizes an infidel. In the background, beyond a large lake, is a landscape with rocky spurs with men and animals. On the shores are a shepherd in a grotto, and a centaur. Detail. Interpretations The exact meaning of the painting had not been yet completely understood, although several hypotheses have been made by art historians. What is sure is that the painting was made for a refined élite, whose education allowed them to understand any subtle detail included in it. Detail. In the early 20th century, Ludwig interpreted it as a pictoral transcription of the early 14th French poem Le Pèlerinage de l'Âme (\\"Pilgrimage of the Soul\\"), by Guillaume de Deguileville. According to him, the painting represents the ideal path of purification of the soul. The hermit shepherd would be St. Anthony the Abbot, descending from his hermitage in the spiritual path inspired to the first hermit, St. Paul, and overcoming several obstacles including the centaur which waits for him at the end of the staircase. The terrace would represent the Paradise Garden, where the souls in Purgatory, symbolized by the children, wait before they are admitted to heaven. Mary, advocate of the men before God, judges the souls with the help of the crowned Justice coronata. Amongst the children, who are playing with the mystic fruits, the one at the tree would be a soul called to the eternal beatitude. The two saints standing on the left would be the patrons, perhaps connected to the works' commissioners, while the two behind the parapet would be Peter and Paul, who guard the gate of Paradise. The river in the background would be Lethe, which surrounds Paradise. The animals would represent the hermits' virtue: the mule for the patience, and the sheep for humility. According to other scholars, the painting would represent a common holy conversation or a vision of the Paradise. Some see Jesus in the children on the cushion, giving to the work the meaning of a meditation about incarnation and redemption.

Construction of the estate began in the early 1960s, starting at the bottom of the hill to the west and gradually spreading upwards and eastwards to be completed in the early 1970s. It was built on the former site of Rise Farm (known as Bulwellrise Farm until around 1900), the southern boundary of which ran along the edge of what is now Rise Park Road, Langbank Avenue and Bracadale Road. The farmhouse had stood on what would now be the south-east corner of Haverill Crescent. On the western boundary ran a railway line, closed in the mid-1960s and now a tree-lined footpath. To the north is Bestwood Country Park and to the east is another housing estate built in the late 1970s on the site of Home Farm. Rise Park primary and nursery school was originally opened as separate infant and junior schools in 1971, built on land once belonging to Top Valley Farm, as was Top Valley Academy which opened in September 1973. Rise Park has had a small parade of shops since 1969 or 1970.

Travoltas are a Dutch pop punk band from the Netherlands. With a sound that combines an energetic mix of the Beach Boys and the Ramones, the band is often referred to as 'The Beach Boys of punk rock'. History Early years: 1990–1996 The Travoltas formed in 1990, with founding members Perry Leenhouts, Vincent Koreman, and Stephan LaHaye joining forces after the demise of the Dutch punkrock formation Kriezus (“Crisis”). With a sound that combines an energetic mix of the Beach Boys and the Ramones, and a dash of the Cars, The Travoltas have had a prolific recording career and sport a list of albums, compilations, EPs, singles, and videos to their credit. With Erik van Vugt replacing LaHaye in 1993, the band released their EP debut, “Kill! Kill! Kill! Sex! Sex! Sex!” in early 1996. Touring and breakthrough: 1997–2000 After recruiting Martijn Smits as their new drummer (with Leenhouts now focusing on lead vocals), the band released the fast-paced “Baja California” in early 1997. Later that summer the band performed at Dynamo Open Air and toured extensively throughout Europe, opening for Marky Ramone and The Intruders. Later that year, Marky Ramone invited the band to record in Brooklyn, New York, and offered to produce Modern World (1998), which established the band’s signature sound that would form the foundation for many releases to come. With a new drummer (Robert van Lieshout) and a second guitarist (Jasper van den Dobbelsteen), the band traveled to Austin, Texas, the following year to perform at the South by Southwest Festival. With van Lieshout replaced by Wouter Verhulst, the group signed with Dutch major label CNR/Arcade to release Teenbeat (2000), and hit the Dutch charts for the first time with the album’s first single and video \\"You Got What I Need\\". Keyboard player Jochem \\"Skokie\\" Weemaes was recruited to complement the surf punk sound with infectious layers of Hammond organ, piano, and vintage synths.{{citation needed|date=September 2020} That summer, the band performed at major festivals such as Lowlands (Netherlands), Groezrock (Belgium), and the NRJ and Great Lakes festivals in Sweden. After an extensive club tour in support of the album, van den Dobbelsteen departed the band to focus on other endeavours. Experimentation and Tribute: 2001 Shortly after signing with Roadrunner Records, the band traveled to Los Angeles to record Club Nouveau (2001). A departure from their signature surf punk sound, The Travoltas experimented with sampled beats and synths, with a strong focus on atmospheric vocal harmonies, showcasing the group’s songwriting and producing skills at multiple levels.{{citation needed|date=September 2020} Aside from a four month club tour following the release of the record, the band performed 10 back-to-back sold out shows as a tribute to the Beach Boys.{{citation needed|date=September 2020} Back to the Roots and America: 2002–2003 Even though van Vugt left the group for a two year hiatus (with Daan van Hooff replacing him on bass guitar), 2002 proved to be a busy and successful year for The Travoltas: after releasing the poppunk classic Endless Summer, the band toured extensively throughout the US, including performances at the Warped Tour festivals. The compilation Step on the Gas, which included previously unreleased tracks, was released later that year followed by a four month back-to-back European tour. In early 2003, in another tribute to The Beach Boys, the band recorded and released the live acoustic album A Travoltas Party!, inspired by the 1965 Beach Boys classic Party!.{{citation needed|date=September 2020} Shortly thereafter van Hooff departed the band, with van Vugt returning from his sabbatical. Japan and the End: 2004–2006 After the departure of founding member Vincent Koreman, with Crustacean guitarist Micky Meeuwissen taking over six string duties, The Travoltas released The High School Reunion (2004), a synth-heavy concept album and tribute to 1980s high school movies and their original soundtracks. In 2005 the group fulfilled its long-held dream of touring in Japan, performing shows in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fujisawa. Sixteen years of touring and releasing records had taken its toll on the band members, and when personal priorities started to shift, The Travoltas officially decided to call it a day in 2006, playing a farewell show on November 18, in Madrid, Spain. The Travoltas are back: 2014–present Breaking eight years of silence, in 2014 the band released the four-track EP The Longest Wait, followed by three sold-out reunion shows in the Netherlands, that included founding member Vincent Koreman with appearances by former band members van den Dobbelsteen and van Hooff. Even though band members had spread out over two continents (and with van Hooff rejoining permanently as rhythm guitarist), the group got together in early 2016 to record Until We Hit The Shore. The 10-track album was recorded at Verhulst’s Amsterdam-based studio Van Sonic, and mixed by Leenhouts over the summer and fall in Chicago, Illinois. The record was released in 2017.

Duration The duration of embryo culture can be varied, conferring different stages of embryogenesis at embryo transfer. The main stages at which embryo transfer is performed are cleavage stage (day 2 to 4 after co- incubation) or the blastocyst stage (day 5 or 6 after co-incubation). Embryos which reach the day 3 cell stage can be tested for chromosomal or specific genetic defects prior to possible transfer by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Embryo culture until the blastocyst stage confers a significant increase in live birth rate per embryo transfer, and there is no evidence of a difference between the groups in cumulative pregnancy rates. Transfer day 2 instead of day 3 after fertilization has no differences in live birth rate. Monozygotic twinning is not increased after blastocyst transfer compared with cleavage-stage embryo transfer. There are significantly higher odds of preterm birth (odds ratio 1.3) and congenital anomalies (odds ratio 1.3) among births from embryos cultured until the blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage. Techniques Culture of embryos can either be performed in an artificial culture medium or in an autologous endometrial coculture (on top of a layer of cells from the woman's own uterine lining). With artificial culture medium, there can either be the same culture medium throughout the period (monoculture medium), or a sequential system can be used, in which the embryo is sequentially placed in different media, with different formulations based on the different concentration and composition of the tubal and uterine fluid in relation to change in the metabolic activity of the embryo during its development. For example, when culturing to the blastocyst stage, one medium may be used for culture to day 3, and a second medium is used for culture thereafter.Comparison Of A Single Medium With Sequential Media For Development Of Human Embryos To The Blastocyst Stage Melanie R. Freeman and Don Rieger. Nashville Fertility Center, Nashville, TN, U.S.A. and LifeGlobal, Guelph, ON, Canada Single or sequential medium are equally effective for the culture of human embryos to the blastocyst stage. Artificial embryo culture media basically contain glucose, pyruvate, and energy-providing components, but the addition of amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and cholesterol improve the performance of embryonic growth and development. Also substances like antioxidants, antibiotics, macromolecules, hormones and growth factors can be added. Methods to permit dynamic embryo culture with fluid flow and embryo movement are also available. A new method in development uses the uterus as an incubator and the naturally occurring intrauterine fluids as culture medium by encapsulating the embryos in a permeable intrauterine vessel. A review in 2013 meta-analysis of commercially available IVF culture media was unable to identify a specific media that was superior in terms of pregnancy outcome. Usage of low oxygen concentrations of 5% rather than about 20% in the atmosphere has been shown to increase live birth rate to a relative probability of 1.24, without any evidence of increased risk for multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or congenital abnormalities.  Buffering system  Control and regulation of pH are mandatory for in vitro embryo culture. Culture media can be classified according to type of buffer used: CO₂ / bicarbonate - buffered medium: uses the same physiologicalbuffering system surrounding mammalian cells. Require the use of CO₂ incubators at 5-7%; Phosphate-buffered medium: do not requires CO₂ environment.seems to have detrimental effects in embryo development in vitro; HEPES-buffered medium:used as buffered medium for human oocyte collection and embryo handling; MOPS- buffered medium: like HEPES, has the potential advantage that the buffering capacity is less temperature dependent. Temperature While it has been hypothesized that incubating at a temperature lower than 37°C may be a more accurate recreation of the temperature in the female reproductive tract, the evidence is uncertain whether different temperatures for embryo culture have different effects on pregnancy or live birth rates. Risks Animal studies have detected epigenetic abnormalities in embryos having undergone embryo culture, indicating a need to optimize the procedures.

The Leicester General Cemetery Company was founded in 1845, and the cemetery itself opened in 1849. The buildings and plan of the cemetery were designed by J. R. Hamilton and J. M. Medland, who also designed cemeteries for Birmingham and Plymouth. Welford Road Cemetery was initially intended for dissenters, but the local Anglican community was able to gain inclusion. The site was initially in size, but was extended by in 1894. The original parts of the cemetery were built to a symmetrical plan. Two adjacent chapels were built, serving both Anglicans and non-Anglicans. Similarly, the original cemetery contained roughly equal areas of consecrated and unconsecrated ground. The two chapels have now been demolished, as has a gothic lodge near the main entrance. The gardener's lodge survives as the University of Leicester chaplaincy, and the ornate 1895 entrance gates are still in place. A modern visitor's centre is located near the cemetery's main entrance. War graves The cemetery contains over 300 British Commonwealth war graves, cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), 286 from the First World War (more than half of these in a war graves plot where a Screen Wall memorial lists names of those buried in it) and 46 from the Second, beside graves of 8 Belgian servicemen (one unidentified). It also has a war memorial which includes a statue designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield.  Notable burials  A leaflet published by Leicester City Council identifies one hundred notable burials within the cemetery. The cemetery itself contains a large number of commemorative plaques, giving biographical information about notable interments. * Ewart Astill – cricketer, playing for Leicestershire County Cricket Club * Thomas Cook – early travel agent and founder of the Thomas Cook Group * John Flower (artist) (1793–1861) * William Green – soldier in the Napoleonic Wars * Bert Harris – professional cyclist * Arthur Wakerley – architect  Controversy  Flattened and damaged gravestones in Welford Road Cemetery Between 2002 and 2004 about 1000 memorials and headstones were laid flat after Leicester City Council 'topple-tested' them for stability. Initially unaware that they needed to obtain a faculty to authorise this in the consecrated ground, the council applied for a faculty retrospectively, although they were opposed in this by relatives of 119 Polish descendants whose relatives' memorials had been laid flat. At first the Consistory Court rejected the Council's application, but this was subsequently granted on appeal to the Court of Arches in 2006. However, in granting the faculty the Court required the Council to work with the Friends of Welford Road Cemetery and members of the local Polish community to restore those flattened memorials.

The church dates back to the 10th century and is one the twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne.Website of the Church of Saint Pantaleon (German) The former monastery church is consecrated to Saint Pantaleon and the Saints Cosmas and Damian and is the oldest church of the cult of Saint Pantaleon west of Byzantium. The empress Theophanu and the archbishop Bruno the Great are buried in the church, which also contains shrines of saints Alban, the first Christian martyr of Britain, and Maurinus of Cologne. Pope Benedict XVI visited the church in 2005.  History  A Roman villa originally occupied the hill, just outside Roman Cologne, on which the church stands. Remains of this villa are still visible in the church crypt. The villa was replaced with a church around 870 and in 955, Archbishop Bruno the Great (brother of Emperor Otto the Great) added a Benedictine abbey. Here, Bruno was buried after his death. In 966, work was begun on a new church to go with the monastery. The church was consecrated in 980.Sacred Destinations: St. Pantaleon Church Holy Roman Empress Theophanu, a Byzantine princess who was married to Emperor Otto II in 972, ordered the construction of the current facade and was also buried in the church at her own request. From 1618 onwards, the building was remodeled in several phases to a Baroque style church. The monastery was dissolved after Cologne was occupied by French revolutionary forces in 1794. The church then served as a horse stable, and, after Cologne became Prussian in 1815, as a Protestant garrison church. A semaphore telegraph was placed on the roof of the church to enable rapid communication between Cologne and the Prussian capital of Berlin. In 1890–1892 the building underwent restoration and in 1922 the church, through an exchange with the Cologne Charterhouse, again became Catholic. During the Second World War, the roof, parts of the outer walls and a large part of the interior were destroyed, but after the war the church was restored. During this restoration, in 1955-1962, an archeological survey was conducted. Around 1956-1957, new church bells were placed, and in 1963 a new organ was installed. The coffered ceiling in the nave, depicting the Tree of Jesse and portraits of various saints, was designed and constructed by artist Dieter Hartmann and was made possible by support of the booster club for the Romanesque churches of Cologne.Förderverein Romanische Kirchen Köln (German) The ceiling in the flanking westwork was done by artist Gerhard Kadow in 1966, and depicts the Heavenly Jerusalem.

In 2010, the Zhangjiang Tram reintroduced this form of transport to Shanghai in the form of a single line in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in suburban Pudong. Additionally, in 2018 and 2019 two steel wheeled tram lines have opened in Songjiang District. History The first tram in Shanghai (1908) Trams on Jiujiang Road in the 1920s  Initial Sections  The first proposal for a tram network in Shanghai was in 1881, Jardine Matheson proposed to the French Concession Board of Directors to open tram services in the French Concession and both parties began planning for a tram network. The Board of Directors adopted the initiative and began planning a tram network. The first tram line in Shanghai was opened between Jing'an Temple and The Bund on January 21, 1908. The line was 6.04 kilometers long and operated by British commercial interests. Later that year the French completed an 8.5 km tram line between The Bund and Xujiahui. In 1912 a locally operated Chinese system opened in Nanshi District.A tram in the 'British system' in the 1920s The Zhangjiang tram opened in 2010 Three tramway systems Three tram companies expanded their routes step by step, and collectively reached their maximum extent in 1925 with 328 tramcars and 14 routes. The British system was the largest with seven routes and 216 trams; the French system, had three routes and 60 trams; the Chinese system and operated 52 trams on four routes totaling 23.5 km in length.Warr, Anne: Shanghai Architecture, The Watermark Press, 2007, During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai in World War II in 1942, the British and French tram systems were placed under the control of the Japanese backed puppet state of the Reorganized Republic of China. During the occupation some tram lines were demolished to support the Japanese war effort. After Japanese surrender in 1945, the tram systems were transferred back to original owners. During the Korean War, anti-western sentiment and sanctions by the United States made it very difficult for the British and French to operate their respective systems. By 1952 and 1953 the British and French companies were shut down and the three tram systems were consolidated and turned over to local control as part of a mass campaigns of the Communist Party to expel foreign influence. Starting from the late-1960s, the number of buses, taxis and private cars increased rapidly, taking over more streetspace and causing traffic congestion. The congestion greatly affected the quality of tram services and tram lines were gradually dismantled or converted into trolleybus lines. The last tram lines were demolished in 1975. 1937 Shanghai tram map.jpg|1937 Shanghai tram map with all three systems 1936 Shanghai tram map.png |1936 Shanghai tram map Shanghai Tramways and Trolley Buses map in 1939.jpg|1939 tram map of the Shanghai International Settlement, showing where the routes were disrupted 1903 Projet de tramways pour la Concession Française de Shanghai, Chine.jpg|A map of 1903 showing the built and planned tram routes in the French concession 21st Century A rubber tired tram opened in Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park in 2010.

She had four masts and was rigged as a barque, with royal sails over double top and topgallant sails. Regina Elena was launched in July 1903, and completed that month. History Regina Elena was built for Pietro Milesi, Genoa. Her first voyage under captain Ameglio was from Genoa to New York and Yokohama, Japan with a consignment of 98,000 boxes of oil, earning Milesi ¢17 per box. From Yokohama she sailed to Port Royal, Jamaica to collect a cargo of lumber which was taken to Antofagasta, Chile where she loaded a cargo of nitrates and departed for Genoa. Her second voyage followed the same route as the first, except that her final destination was Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Regina Elena's third voyage was from Antwerp, Belgium to San Francisco carrying general cargo. In San Francisco, she loaded cereals for Delagoa Bay, Mozambique. A cargo of timber was then taken to Sydney. She then loaded coal at Newcastle, and sailed to Junín, Argentina, the passage taking 35 days. Nitrates were loaded, and Regina Elena sailed to Funchal, Portugal in 89 days, where orders were given to discharge her cargo at Genoa. Her fourth voyage was from Genoa to Barry, Wales where a cargo of coal was loaded for Callao, Peru, which was reached in 104 days. She then sailed to Ballestas where a cargo of guano was loaded. This was taken to Antwerp, the voyage taking 134 days due to hurricane-force winds at Cape Horn. In 1911, Regina Elena was sold to F. Laeisz, Hamburg for £13,000. She was renamed Ponape. On 20 September 1914, Ponape was arrested by and escorted into Falmouth. She was declared a war prize and placed under the management of James Bell, Hull by the Admiralty. She was then renamed Bellhouse. In May 1915, Bellhouse was sold to A/S Bellhouse, Tønsberg, Norway. She was operated under the management of Alf Monsen, Tønsberg. In 1925, Bellhouse was sold to Hugo Lundquist, Mariehamn, Finland and renamed Ponape. She was assigned the Finnish Official Number 778 and the Code Letters TPQS. In 1925, Ponape was carrying a cargo of lumber to Melbourne, Australia when she was caught in a storm to the north west of Iceland and was almost swamped. The voyage to Melbourne took 155 days.

The site stopped generating power in 2003 and is in the process of being decommissioned. Athlone Power Station was situated on the N2 freeway into the city, consisted of a large brick generation building, two 99m brick chimneys, and two cooling towers, fed by reclaimed water from a nearby sewage plant. It was commissioned in 1962 with 6 turbines with a nominal capacity of 180 megawatts, and operated by the City of Cape Town. Between 1985 and 1994 the station was held on standby, but it resumed generating in 1995 with a reduced capacity of 120 MW. Between 1995 and 2003 it was mainly used to generate power in peak demand periods and during power failures of the national grid. In 2003, significant investment was required due to the age of the power station, and generation was stopped. Decommissioning Athlone was the last coal-fired power station operating in Cape Town; the others, in the city centre and Salt River, were demolished in the 1980s and 1990s. The cost of transport means that coal costs three to five times more in Cape Town than it does near the mines inland, making it more economical to transmit power from there to Cape Town than to generate power in Cape Town from transported coal. The lifespan of the station's two cooling towers had been extended in 1993 through the addition of reinforcing bands, but on 14 February 2010, the bands on one tower collapsed, leading the city to announce that the towers would be demolished by the end of April 2010 to prevent their collapse; the demolition was postponed to 22 August 2010 when they were finally demolished. The power station building and two 99m high chimneys are still standing while the city decides on the future of the site. Image of the Power Station before the demolition of the cooling towers.

He was founder and owner-editor of the Queensland Figaro, later known as the Queensland Figaro and Punch. 'Bobby' Byrne was born in Canning Town, East London in 1842, and was of Scottish descent. He had two brothers Julius Byrne, a stockbroker of Gracechurch St London, the other being Dr Theodore E. D. Byrne better known as the \\"Jumping Dr of Gympie\\". The latter was originally a surgeon apprenticed to a parish doctor at Islington, but he later signed up as a surgeon superintendent in charge of the immigrant ship 'The Light Brigade', subsequently arriving to Brisbane on 18 May 1863. 'Bobby' Byrne himself presumably came to Queensland around 1860. He earned his spurs and a solid reputation as an Australian 'bushman' during the famed 1860s Gulf country rush. He subsequently worked for several years as a busman and occasional free-lance journalist on Queensland's north western frontier before marriage, urban family life and a full-time position in journalism finally caught up with him. He settled initially in Maryborough in 1871 but was persuaded to move south to Brisbane with his family in late 1878. Byrne revealed in an obituary in the Figaro in October 1887, that had served on Carl Feilberg's staff on the short-lived Brisbane 'Daily News' in late 1878, adding that he had a friendship with Feilberg dating back to Maryborough in 1871. 'Carl was a mate of mine of some 16 years' standing', he wrote. For that reason alone, it is perhaps not surprising that Byrne and the Figaro in March and April 1883 became the first Queensland journal to take up the mantle from Feilberg and briefly campaign for a change to Queensland's policy towards or Aboriginal people at the frontier. Byrne directed considerable criticism at the new chief editorship of Charles Hardie Buzacott on The Brisbane Courier and its weekly The Queenslander. Buzacott, he claimed, had introduced a censorship on all matters related to the native police, cruelty and violation of the rights of Aboriginal people on the Queensland frontier.Palmer, E: Early Days in North Queensland, London 1902, p.158-59;Ørsted-Jensen, R: The Right to Live, chapter 10.

The district contains 33 contributing buildings and two contributing structures built between 1886 and the 1960s. It consists of a small mountainside collection of studios and residences clustered about the original Pakatakan Lodge. It is an extremely well preserved collection of unusual Shingle Style and other wood frame seasonal buildings. See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.  History  The name \\"Pakatakan\\" is the name of the mountain near the colony. It is believed to mean \\"meeting of the waters\\" from the Tuscarora peoples. Arkville was one of the earliest settlements in the area, originating at the beginning of the 19th century. The 1870s were the beginning of tourism in the Catskills and hotels were built along the Ulster and Delaware railroad. In 1886, the first structure of the Pakatakan Artists Colony was built, the Hoffman House. The Hoffman House was initiated through John Francis Murphy's persuasion of local businessman Peter F. Hoffman to build a hotel to cater to artists. The artists who came to the Hoffman House included Alexander Helwig Wyant, George Smillie, Parker Mann (1852–1918) and Edward Lloyd Field (1856–1914). These artists were associated with the Catskill Mountain School of landscape artists whose distinct style was distinct from their predecessor, Hudson River School.  Architecture  The original buildings were built between 1886 and 1930 and are primarily shingled or novelty styled with simile design and limited ornamentation. Common features include shingled sides, steeply pitched roofs, overhanging unboxed eaves, and brick fireplaces. They are incorporated harmoniously on the landscape. The studio buildings largely have large, multi-pane windows to provide views of the landscape and the interior space primarily devoted to a large, high-ceiling room.

The original members were Benny Miller, Rob Zipper, Alan Zipper, Leigh Sagar, Angus McLean and Billy Toon. History In November 1969, Rob & Alan Zipper, Ivor Rubenstein and Leigh Sagar travelled to Cape Town in South Africa, with all of their gear, for a playing holiday. They were invited to play at the Battle of the Bands at Green Point Stadium and were extremely well received. This led to an invitation to a residency in a Johannesburg club and then to their being signed up by the Clive Calder-Ralph Simon management team who produced the group's first album in two days. They had a recording contract with EMI and undertook three national tours, playing at city halls in almost every city in South Africa, Rhodesia and Mozambique. Singer and flautist, Martin Jackson, had a brief spell in the line-up during this period but left in November 1970 and was replaced by Harry Paulus. Bennie Miller, the guitarist from Salisbury (now Harare), originated the group but left in 1969 when the band went to South Africa. He rejoined briefly at the end of 1970 and mid 1972. Otis Waygood's blues-jazz fusion made them one of the top live bands in South Africa of the early '70s touring South Africa and Rhodesia. In 1971 the group traveled to play in the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom, where they settled. In 1976, they added three Caribbean musicians to their line-up and pursued a more reggae-based sound. After several years of playing the British clubs, pubs and concert halls as Otis Waygood, in 1977 they changed their name to Immigrant and their final tour was supporting Tavares, ending up at the Palladium, in London. The group disbanded in 1979 The band name originated from a transposition of the name appearing on a number of lifts installed in Rhodesian buildings by Waygood Otis elevators. Waygood & Co. (later R Waygood & Co. and Waygood Otis) was a UK- based elevator company which was merged with Otis.

It is housed in the Fondazione Querini Stampalia, in Venice, Italy. History The dating of the work is uncertain, though it is usually considered to be subsequent to the Presentation at the Temple by Andrea Mantegna (Berlin, c. 1455), from which Bellini took a very similar placement of the figures. The commission of the two works is unknown, as well as if the figures, as is sometimes suggested, portrayed members of the Mantegna and Bellini families. Description and style The main characters are nearly the same as those in Mantegna's work: the Virgin is holding the Child, whose feet are lying on a cushion, while the bearded figure of Simeon is coming to take him. In the front is Saint Joseph, which, according to some scholars, would be a portrait of Bellini's father, Jacopo. On the sides the painter added two further figures, which make the picture rather crowded. Apart his father, other identifications include the author's self-portrait and Mantegna (or his brother Gentile Bellini) for the two men on the right; and Nicolosia, sister of Giovanni and Gentile, and wife of Mantegna, together with their mother Anna for the women on the left. Bellini also replaced Mantegna's bronze frame with a parapet, making the characters nearer to the observer, and omitted their haloes.

Cardiovascular procedures requiring catheterization include diagnostic procedures that help diagnose diseased blood vessels and interventional procedures such as angioplasty, the placement of a stent and coronary thrombectomy. During such procedures, a small incision is made in the groin area and a hole is created in the femoral artery to gain access to the artery. This hole is referred to as the access site or puncture site. At the completion of the procedure, the hole needs to be closed. Metal clip-based and suture-based VCDs may reduce time to hemostasis when compared with extrinsic (manual or mechanical) compression. However, no type of VCD has been shown to be more effective or safe than another. Goals The main goal of a Vascular Closure Device is to provide rapid hemostasis of the artery as well as reduce access site complications.Maureen Leahy-Patano. Sealing the Deal at the Access Site. Diagnostic and Invasive Cardiology. May/June 2008 VCD's also help reduce time to ambulation and time to hospital discharge.Harold L. Dauerman MD FACC, et al. Vascular Closure Devices: The Second Decade. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2007;50(17) In addition, VCD's are more comfortable for the patient compared to manual compression. History Prior to the development of VCD's, the main method for closing the femoral artery was manual compression. Manual compression involves up to 30 minutes of manual pressure or mechanical clamps applied directly to the patient's groin, which is very painful, followed by up to 8 hours of bed rest in the hospital recovery room. Vascular Closure Devices were introduced in the early 1990s in an effort to reduce the time to hemostasis, enable early ambulation and improve patient comfort. Initially, devices focused on technologies involving a suture or a collagen plug.Harold L. Dauerman MD FACC, et al. Vascular Closure Devices: The Second Decade. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2007;50(17) These technologies are effective at closing the hole; however, they often leave an intravascular component in the artery, which can cause complications. In addition, these technologies failed to accurately address patient pain. More recent methods to close the hole involve the use of novel materials that dissolve over a short period of time, such as polyethylene glycol found in the Mynx vascular closure device. These technologies incorporate a more gentle deployment of the material to the outside of the artery and avoid the use of intravascular components, leaving nothing behind in the artery and consequently improving patient comfort.D.

It was designed by John James Clark and built in 1886 by Dennis Kellcher. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 May 2003.  History  Townsville Post Office with the first clock tower, circa 1900 The Post Office was constructed in a number of stages. The first stage was a two- storey telegraph office at a cost of almost £6000, following an 1886 extension for a post office (ground floor) with a residence for the postmaster on the upper floor) costing over £8000. Dennis Kellcher submitted a tender and carried out extensions in 1888, while a clock tower was built by Henry L Davis & Co. Chimes were imported from England in 1889 and installed by 1891. Following the bombing of Darwin, the clocktower was dismantled in 1942 and the mechanism was stored away. A greatly modified tower was built in 1963-64 by JE Allen & Co. of Townsville at a cost of £42,135. The interior was also modernised at this time. Because of its prominent location, the Post Office often became the scene of political rallies around a speaker on a soap box. In 2001, it was redeveloped as The Brewery, owned by the Townsville Brewing Company. The company brews beer on-site and has a restaurant and bar.  Description  left The Post Office is a cement-rendered brick building, which displays Renaissance features. Its asymmetric facade has a loggia on the lower level, which shades the building along Flinders and Denham Streets and a verandah along the front and side facade of the upper level. The lowpitched hipped roof of corrugated iron extends into four gabled projections, while a slender clocktower and parapeted cupola dominates the corner. On the upper level, French doors open onto the verandah, with sashed windows in all other openings. The interior is not as intact as the facade because of years of alterations. The building stands in a commanding position in the streetscape at the eastern end of Flinders Mall. It can be seen from across Ross Creek and enhances the western end of historic Flinders Street East. Despite interior modifications, the basic structure is intact and in excellent condition.  Heritage listing  The former Townsville Post Office was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 May 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Post Office is a most significant building of its type and in its particular location. It is a fine example of a purpose-built colonial government building displaying Renaissance elements. For over one hundred years it has been a landmark in the streetscape of the town. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

Depending on the level of development of a country's health care system and the organization of its workforce, an HRHIS can be computerized or paper- based, including information on numbers and distribution of health workers and track their career information. It is usually an integral part of a comprehensive health management information system, and may be used to monitor and assess the performance of the overall health system. For example, in Tanzania the title Human Resource for Health Information System refers to an open-source software for HRH information management developed by the Department of Computer Science, University of Dar es Salaam for the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania), and funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and other development partners.JICA’s Cooperation on Human Resources for Health. Japan International Cooperation Agency, January 2011. Accessed 9 March 2011. The system supports the capture of data linked to any level in the organizational hierarchy and is customizable at both the input and output sides. In Canada, the HRHIS is composed of multiple computerized components, including the National Physician Database and the Registered Nurses Database. Similar systems have been developed and implemented elsewhere. In Uganda, an open-source HRHIS was implemented under the request of the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MOH), to link and better manage a variety of independent sources of health workforce data, including data from censuses and other national surveys, MOH administrative records, district level sources, independent research studies, and health professional council data. In Brazil, the national web-based HRHIS (known in Portuguese as sistema de informação e gestão de recursos humanos em saúde) was implemented by the Brazilian Ministry of Health under a process of health systems reform and decentralization, catalyzed by the availability of new information technologies at the level of local health organizations. Botswana developed its HRHIS in 1994, and Ministry of Health staff used the data as a basis for coordinated national workforce planning efforts with other agencies and ministries, such as the Department of Local Government which employs health workers in local regions.Using Human Resource for Health Data: Health policy and program planning examples from four African countries. United States Agency for International Development, 2008. Accessed 9 March 2011.  HRHIS in Tanzania  The Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) identified health workforce information as a key area needing to be strengthened for fast tracking implementation of its Human Resource Strategic Plan.United Republic of Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Health Sector Strategic Plan III, July 2009–June 2015. Dar es Salem, 2009. The HRHIS was implemented as an effort to improve human resources for health (HRH) management. A situation analysis indicated the existence of several databases within and outside the ministry dealing with HRH, often with similar information fields. It was agreed these sources should be harmonized, and housed under Health Management Information System (HMIS) for consistency. The HRHIS software thus became part of the HMIS and was fully integrated with the District Health Information System (DHIS) software through import/export mechanisms. The HRHIS was built using free and open source technologies PHP (server scripting language), PostgreSQL (database management system) running on multi-platform (Windows, Linux) architecture, and designed to be user- friendly allowing administrators or authorized users to add additional elements as new needs arise. The initial database was populated with the minimum dataset as requested by the MOHSW. The HRHIS provided import/output mechanisms for data at different levels, such as national, regional, district or facility level. It was designed to provide flexibility to: *Capture and store health personnel's data and history by organizational unit, cadre, and other characteristics; *Add any number of datasets or elements required by any sector (such as the central health ministry, local governments, civil services or private providers); *Update organizational unit details according to users' requirements (e.g. allowing additional regions, districts and health facilities to be added dynamically without entering into system codes); *Generate web-enabled reports in different formats (general and aggregated), including graphical reporting. Since human resource information/data are personal and confidential, the HRHIS system was developed with high security measures for protecting the data entered. Security measures include a login mechanism such that only authorized personnel can use the system, and also a Users Administration functionality which allows the system administrator to limit users' access to certain functions. The system was built by UDSM developers and analysts considered conversant with the changing needs of the health sector and Tanzania's context. It is used in MOHSW headquarters, across the Coast region (regional level and all districts), and implementation has covered all Regions and Districts in Tanzania Mainland  HRHIS in Canada  The Canadian Institute for Health Information maintains several HRH databases as part of a comprehensive national HRHIS. They include: *Registered Physicians Database *Registered Nurses Database *Pharmacist Database *Occupational Therapist Database *Medical Radiation Technologist Database *Medical Laboratory Technologist Database *Physiotherapist Database *Scott’s Medical Database. The databases capture and store information on workforce size, practice settings and regulatory environments, as well as trends in supply, demographics and education. They record information captured through transmission according to specifications from all provinces and territories, professional regulatory and licensing bodies, and/or educational institutions. Each database includes unique identifiers for tracking health professionals through time and as they move from one location to another; is accompanied by documentation on data quality; and is governed by security arrangements with respect to the protection of personal information of health professionals. The data are used by governments, researchers and professional associations for HRH planning.

Laid down as the UK merchant vessel Speybank in 1926, the vessel was captured in 1941 by the , converted to an auxiliary minelayer for the Kriegsmarine and renamed Doggerbank. After laying mines off the coast of South Africa, it travelled to Japan. On the return trip, it was accidentally sunk by the , with all but one of the 365 men on board (108 crew plus 257 passengers) lost at sea. History Speybank was built in 1926 at Harland & Wolff at Govan, Glasgow for Andrew Weir & Co. The ship was captured on 31 January 1941 by German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis in the Indian Ocean. Speybank was sent back to France under the command of Paul Schneidewind and reached Bordeaux on 10 May 1941. The ship was taken over by the German Kriegsmarine in 1941, renamed Doggerbank – Schiff 53 (German: \\"Ship 53\\"), and converted to an auxiliary minelayer. It remained under the command of Kapitänleutnant Paul Schneidewind. Doggerbank left France in January 1942 to lay mines of the coast of South Africa and then to proceed to Japan. The mines were laid successfully in March/April 1942 and Doggerbank arrived in Japan later that year. Last voyage In Japan, Doggerbank took aboard many of the survivors of the auxiliary cruiser and the German tanker Uckermark, the former Altmark, which had been destroyed in an accident in Yokohama on 30 November 1942. In total, the ship carried 365 men on board (108 crew, plus 257 from the other two ships) when leaving the Far East. It also carried a cargo of 7,000 tons of raw materials and rubber, fats and fish oil. The ship travelled via Kobe, Saigon, Singapore and Jakarta, which it left on 10 January 1943, heading to France. In the mid-Atlantic on 3 March 1943, at 9.53 pm, it was torpedoed by . U-43 mistook it for a British ship \\"of the type\\" as Doggerbank was traveling ahead of its schedule. The ship was hit by all three torpedoes fired at it and sank within two minutes, with perhaps two hundred men killed instantly. Aftermath U-43 observed five life boats being launched by the ship and attempted to make contact with the survivors, but failed to get close enough because of the darkness. Unaware of the ship's sinking as it had been unable to send a distress signal, the German admiralty took days to realise the ship had been lost. The eventual sole survivor of the crew of 108 and the 257 others on board, Fritz Kürt, was in Doggerbank's jolly boat, together with the ship's captain, Schneidewind, a small number of other men and the ship's dog. The boat headed for the South American coast, approximately three weeks away. Through suicide and accidents, the small crew was eventually reduced to two, Kürt and an old sailor by the name of Boywitt, the captain having shot himself and the ship's dog having drowned. Desperate for water and food, Boywitt drank sea water on the 19th day of their journey and died, while Kürt was too weak to even roll the dead body overboard. Kürt was eventually picked up by the Spanish motor tanker Campoamor on 29 March and taken to Aruba. The German submarine U-43 was sunk on 30 July 1943 without survivors. Kürt was exchanged in a prisoner-of-war swap in 1944, reported back to the German admiralty and then hid in Hamburg until the end of the war, having been about to be arrested.

It was published on August 28, 2012, six years after the publication of the previous book. Tippy Tinkletrousers is actually Professor Poopypants, as revealed in the previous book. This book explains how Tippy Tinkletrousers arrived at the end of the eighth book, as well as a prequel story of George and Harold in kindergarten explaining how their friendship began and setting the page for their life before Captain Underpants. Plot Tippy has come from the future, and George and Harold are arrested for the crimes that their alternate versions did, and the two (and Krupp) are imprisoned. At the Piqua State Penitentiary, Tippy is asked to build a statue (secretly a robot suit) of Warden Gordon, the chief jailer of the prison. On the day Tippy presents his robot suit, he freezes everyone in his way, then takes Krupp to find the boys for Tippy. George and Harold snap their fingers bringing Captain Underpants to life, and soon, while trying to freeze him, Tippy accidentally freezes his robotic legs. Even though Captain Underpants successfully pulls off the top half of the robo-suit, Tippy escapes by going back in time to a bit over five years ago. Moved in from Michigan, five-and- three-quarters-year-old George's mother makes him wear a tie as a good first impression. On his way to school, he notices six-year-old Harold being attacked by Kipper and his group, with the mean owner of a gas station, Billy Bill, egging them on. Angered at this, George plays a smart prank on the owner by changing his gas station's sign from \\"Free Brake Inspection\\" to \\"Free Bra Inspection\\", prompting a group of infuriated and offended women to attack the latter (and maybe even strangle him to death!). George then saves Harold and the two become best friends. Mr. Krupp arrives and sends the two to detention for \\"bullying Kipper\\". To pass time, the two make their first comic: The Adventures of Dog Man. George and Harold study Kipper for a week and then later switch his padlock for one of their own locks, and replace his stolen lunch money with girly things like friendship bracelets, dresses, and dolls, while sending strange texts to Kipper's goons, all while placing a note from \\"Wedgie Magee\\" with it. However, Kipper eventually catches on to the setup and, the next day, him and his gang steal the pizzas that George and Harold bought for the kindergartners as a way to torture them even further. Infuriated, the two friends come up with another major prank on the bullies in retaliation. First, they fill the four bullies' lockers with shaving cream to pass it off as ectoplasmic ghost juice. While initially this works, Principal Krupp points out that the \\"ectoplasm\\" was obviously sprayed through the vents on doors. Enraged and tired of the anonymous pranks, Kipper and his friends begin to torture the kindergarteners for answers, even stealing more pizzas, which George and Harold were actually counting on them to steal, as they ordered them to have double ghost chili peppers (Piqua Pizza Palace's hottest chili peppers) which cause the bullies' tongues to burn up completely, resulting in them getting sent to the nurse's office. George and Harold eventually create a comic that tells the tale of Wedgie Magee and the signs of his curse, all of which match their pranks. After Kipper and his gang \\"see\\" that ghost (George on stilts, wearing a giant pair of pants), they run outside in terror, during a severe thunderstorm and power outage. In the original timeline, they then apologize for their deeds, compensate the kindergartners, and never bully anyone again. Unfortunately, Tippy arrives in the past at exactly the same time Kipper's gang runs outside. The four bullies go insane from fear as Tippy's robot closely resembles the ghost of Wedgie Magee. This causes the police to accuse Principal Krupp of causing Kipper and his friends' insanity despite no charges being filed against him, which eventually results in him permanently losing his job. Tippy then time travels four years back in the future, believing that kids five years ago were weird. However, as Mr. Krupp was hypnotized to become Captain Underpants when George and Harold were in the 4th grade, a paradox happens, and a universe is created where Captain Underpants never existed. Tippy arrives in the present only to find out all that remains of Earth is a flaming and devastated wasteland (caused by Dr. Diaper's Laser-Matic 2000) overrun by talking toilets and giant evil zombie nerds (because the boy whose mother thinks he talks crazy tells Tippy everything). Tippy realises that he has to go back again and save Earth. However, Tippy immediately gets squashed by George and Harold, who are now giant zombies nerds. What remains left of Tippy is a red squishy stain, appearing to be blood. Comics The Adventures of Dog Man One day, the cop and his specifically trained police dog Greg spot a bomb, but they are critically injured by its explosion and the doctor announces that Greg's body and the cop's head are dying. Fortunately, the surgical crew sews Greg's head on the Cop's body and everyone calls the hybrid \\"Dog Man.\\" Dog Man catches criminals with his sensitive nose, hears crimes with his ears, and punches criminals with his fists. Petey, Rip Van Tinkle's former feline minion, sees Dog Man's weakness and invents an evil vacuum robot, which steals all the money from the bank and Dog Man comes to stop it, but the vacuum chases him until he is cornered. Dog Man is certain he will die but the vacuum robot unplugs and shuts down, then he follows its cord to Petey's hideout and Dog Man arrests him. Dog Man celebrates by drinking some alcohol-free wine with his fellow cops. The Curse of Wedgie Magee The comic is about a boy called Wedgie Magee who is bullied up to the point where he can't bear it any longer. He visits a fortune teller who tells him she will concoct an anti- wedgie elixir. However, the fortune teller is short-sighted and grabs a voodoo elixir by mistake. The next day, Wedgie rubs the elixir onto his trousers, turning them into a ghost. He then dies of embarrassment. That evening, the trousers return for revenge and swallow up the bullies. Signs of the curse: # The victim will begin to act weird # The victim wants to play with dolls, dresses and bracelets # The victim gets ectoplasm (ghost juice) and spiders on their belongings # Food like pizza is very spicy to the victim # The victim will feel a burning sensation in the armpits. How to undo the curse: The victim must undo their bad deeds and never pick on kindergarteners ever again.

At the age of 28, she opened a studio in Copenhagen where she specialized in indoor photography. She later became Denmark's first female court photographer, working not only with the Danish royal family but, at the invitation of Princess Alexandra, with the British royal family too. She also played an important part in improving conditions for female workers and encouraging women to take up the profession of photography. Early life Born in a village between Aarhus and Randers in Jutland, Steen was the daughter of Niels Jensen Steen, a schoolteacher, and Caroline Kirstine Petersen. In her late teens, she moved to Copenhagen where she graduated at the Women's Business School but she soon found out that she was not made for office work. She decided to take up photography and received training first in Sweden and then with a photographer in Copenhagen. Professional career Mary Steen: Queen Victoria and Princess Beatrice, Windsor Castle (1895) In 1884, at the age of 28, she opened her own photographic studio on Amagertorv in the centre of Copenhagen. At the 1888 Nordic Exhibition she won a silver medal for her photographs of both royalty and ordinary citizens in their homes, and she also exhibited at the 1893 World Exhibition in Chicago. Steen's speciality was indoor photography, a difficult art at a time when electricity was not widespread. The photographs she took at the Flerons' house on Copenhagen's Vesterbrogade are among the first showing people inside their own homes. The indoor photographs in Et minde fra Fredensborg i fjor (Last year's memories of Fredensborg) are among the first shots to be published in the magazine Illustreret Tidende.Louise Wolthers, Et billede af nationen in Dansk Fotografihistorie, ed. Mette Sandbye (Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 2004), p. 78. . In 1888, she became the first female court photographer for Princess Alexandra who was to marry Great Britain's Edward VII. Around 1895, Princess Alexandra invited her to London where she photographed members of the royal family, including Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. As a result of growing deafness, she closed her studio in 1918. Promoting feminism In 1891, she was the first woman on the board of the Danish Photographers Association. She was also active in the Danish Women's Society (Dansk Kvindesamfund) where she sat on the board from 1889–1892. Together with Julie Laurberg, she photographed the leading figures in the Danish women's movement. In 1891, she received a grant from the Reiersenske Fond, a trade association, which allowed her to travel to Germany and Vienna. She campaigned for better working conditions for women including eight days holiday and a half day off on Sundays. She treated her own staff well, paying good wages. Overall assessment Steen considered her work to be art. Photography was becoming an attractive profession for women. Agnes Henningsen who became a trainee with Mary Steen in 1895 provides a lively description of Steen in her memoirs Byen erobret, published in 1945: \\"Everything about Mary Steen was powerful and energetic. She shook her head decisively, refusing to have a trainee. She would discourage anyone who wanted to open a studio in Copenhagen. (...) I concluded: 'So I won't be able to take those children, Miss Steen. The only thing I want is to be a photographer.' She stood up, gesturing meaningfully: 'Start tomorrow.'\\"Henningsen, Agnes, Byen erobret: erindringer, Copenhagen 1945.

It was designed by architect P. S. Stott and was constructed in 1905 by the Heron Mill Company Ltd next to Durban Mill. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production ended in 1960, and it was used by Courtaulds for offices, warehousing, and some experimental fabric manufacture. Location Oldham is a large town in Greater Manchester, England. It lies amongst the Pennines on elevated ground between the rivers Irk and Medlock, south-southeast of Rochdale, and northeast of the city of Manchester. Oldham is surrounded by several smaller settlements which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham; Chadderton and Hollinwood are such settlements. Chadderton and Hollinwood are served by the Rochdale Canal and the Hollinwood Branch Canal. A rail service was provided by the Oldham Loop Line that was built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. History Oldham rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming \\"one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England\\", spinning Oldham counts, the coarser counts of cotton. Oldham's soils were unfavorable for crop growing, and so for decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that Oldham changed from being a cottage industry township, producing woollen garments via domestic manual labour, to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories. The first mill, Lees Hall, was built by William Clegg in about 1778. Within a year, 11 other mills had been constructed, but by 1818 there were only 19 of these privately owned mills. In the second half of the 19th century Oldham became a world centre for spinning cotton yarn. This was due in a large part to the formation of limited liability companies known as Oldham Limiteds. In 1851, over 30% of Oldham's population were employed in the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain. At its zenith it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world. By 1871 Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By 1911 there were 16.4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143.5 million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were over 360 mills, operating night and day. The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914–18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Heron Mill, Hollinwood was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950.  Architecture  Heron Mill in 1951 The 5-storey mill was built in a group with Durban Mill and the earlier Brook Mill. It was designed by P.S.Stott. It was extended in 1977. In 1951 it still displayed the decorative features typical of a P. S. Stott mill including the double bands on the mill chimney.  Power The mill's machines were driven by a 1400 hp vertical cross compound engine, built by George Saxon & Co in 1902. It had a 16 ft flywheel with 32 ropes which operated at 80 rpm. The cylinders 26\\" HP, 50\\" LP had a 4 ft stroke. There were Corliss valves on both cylinders. Air pumps were driven from LP crosshead.  Equipment  This was a mule mill with 105,000 spindles in 1915, supplied by Asa Lees. Usage It is now used as a warehouse.

Bangs (1862-1917) and Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Snow Bangs (1859-1920), were two fraudulent spiritualist mediums from Chicago, who made a career out of painting the dead or \\"Spirit Portraits\\".Baker, Robert A. (1992). Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions From Within. Prometheus Books. p. 223. \\"In Chicago in 1909 Hereward Carrington investigated and caught the sisters in fraud. Carrington addressed a letter in a sealed envelope to 'Dearest Mother Jane Thompson' (who never existed), and he received a reply addressed to 'Dearly Loved Son Harold,' signed by his devoted mother, Jane. Moreover, Carrington had the magician David P. Abbott duplicate the Bangs sisters' work exactly. Over the years a number of charges of fraud were brought against them, and fraud in their slate writing and their materialized spirits were convincingly established.\\" Career 1905 Newspaper Ad: \\"The Bangs Sisters\\" Elizabeth was born in 1859 to Edward D. Bangs (1827-1899) and Meroe L. Stevens Bangs (1832-1917) while they were living in Atchison, Kansas, and Mary was born there in 1862. Edward was a tinsmith and stove repairman, originally from Massachusetts. Their mother was a medium herself, and soon got her four children (sons Edward and W.B.) into the act. They moved to Chicago in 1868. By the early 1870s the Bangs family were performing seances as described in an article by Steven Sanborn Jones published on August 3, 1872 in Religio-Philosophical Journal titled \\"An Evening with the Bangs Children.\\" People paid to be entertained at the Bangs home. Messages from the dead appeared on slabs of slate as chairs and furniture moved about the room. The children were tied up in a cabinet, then a guitar inside strummed and hands waved from within. For the finale, Mary brought forward a cat, said to be a \\"spirit kitten\\" from the afterworld. In the summer of 1881, May and her mother were arrested for \\"doing business without a license\\",\\" and while they claimed to be evangelists and such charges could not be brought against ministers, they were fined by the police court the following day. On April 2, 1888, two plainclothes police arrested May and Lizzie during a seance and confiscated all of their props. They were released on bail the next day. While they were out on bail, Lizzie's seven-year-old daughter died. At the same time, an article in the Washington Post published on April 17, 1888 reported that Lizzie and May Bangs had created the very lucrative firm, the \\"Bangs Sisters\\", which operated spiritualistic parlors in the Chicago area. That year, one of their wealthy clients, photographer Henry Jestram, reportedly paid vast amounts of his fortune for their seances. When Jestram died after being committed to an insane asylum, many blamed the Bangs Sisters. By November 1890, May was on her second divorce, from wealthy chemical manufacturer Henry H. Graham. They had been married under the pretense that his dead wife had told him to do so. According to the Chicago Daily Tribune, in March 1890, a Chicago grand jury declined to bring charges against the Bangs Sisters, but in May 1891, the Illinois Senate passed a bill: > ...prohibiting anyone from personating the spirits of the dead, commonly > known as spirit-medium séances, on penalty of fine and imprisonment. According to the Los Angeles Times, the two sisters even fooled G.W.N. Yost, one of the main investors in the typewriter, with their \\"spirit typewriter\\" which produced messages from everyone from Moses to James Garfield. In late 1894, Lizzie and May began \\"spirit painting\\", with \\"Life Sized Spirit Portraits a Specialty\\" printed on their business cards. It was not long before they ventured out of Chicago. As reported in the Fort Wayne Sentinel on September 10, 1894, the Bangs conducted a Massachusetts wedding ceremony between a wealthy woman and her dead fiancé. For the next five years, they regularly held seances and performed the spirit slate writings at their home in Chicago. The spirit paintings were the most commanding of price, with people paying anywhere between $15 to $150 per portrait. Dr. Isaac K. Funk of Funk and Wagnalls paid $1,500 for a number of departed portraits. In 1907 came the next victim of May's marriages. Millionaire leather manufacturer Jacob H. Lesher was \\"told\\" to marry May by his dead mother, and according to a July 16, 1909 story in the Chicago Daily Tribune, was divorced and penniless in less than 24 months. Fraud David P. Abbott, a magician who exposed the Bangs Sisters. Regarding the sisters' drawings, magic historian David Witter has noted that \\"experts have surmised that sketches were made beforehand, hidden and slowly moved forward into the light by a free hand while the subjects were not looking.\\" Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that \\"the Bangses were exposed as tricksters many times.\\" In 1901, the psychologist Stanley LeFevre Krebs exposed the sisters as frauds; he employed a hidden mirror and caught them removing a blank letter sealed between two slates and writing a reply which they would pretend a spirit had written.Nickell, Joe. (2001). Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 267-268. Hereward Carrington who sat with the sisters in 1909 found their slate-writing to be fraudulent.Tabori, Paul. (1972). Pioneers of the Unseen. Souvenir Press. pp. 47-48. He had also set up a trap by inventing a fictitious mother named \\"Jane Thompson\\" in a sealed letter. He received a reply signed by Jane from the sisters. Psychical researcher Paul Tabori noted that Carrington \\"also analysed their way of producing 'spirit paintings' or 'portraits'. The ladies simply substituted one canvas for another, under the cover of their voluminous dress, the table or window-curtains.\\" The Bangs sisters were defended by the spiritualist writer William Usborne Moore. He stated in his book Glimpses of the Next State that Carrington had never visited their house. After Carrington gave incontrovertible evidence he had visited the sisters and caught them in fraud, Moore had to publicly retract his charges in a letter for Light, December 14, 1912.Moore, William Usborne. Mr Hereward Carrington and the Bangs Sisters. Light. December 14, 1912. p. 598 Magician Milbourne Christopher has written: :Wilmar (William Marriott) had read about the marvelous paintings produced during seances by a pair of Chicago psychics, the Bangs sisters. He wrote David P. Abbott, an amateur magician and investigator of alleged psychic phenomena, who lived in Omaha, Nebraska, asking if by chance he had solved the mystery. Abbott replied that not only had he duplicated the marvel, he also had added several touches to make the feat effective onstage. Abbott described the routine in detail.Christopher, Milbourne. (1996). The Illustrated History of Magic. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 261. In 1913, David P. Abbott published a booklet on the subject The Spirit Portrait Mystery, Its Final Solution, revealing fraudulent methods of producing the portraits.Abbott, David P. (1913).

Biography Dacia Valent was born in Mogadishu to an Italian father and a Somali mother. She traveled extensively around the world during her youth and moved permanently to Udine, in Northern Italy, in 1980. In 1985, while she lived in Udine, her 16-year-old brother Giacomo was stabbed to death as the result of a fight with two classmates. She lived in Rome at the time of his death. After an unsuccessful period as an Engineering student and after the breakup of her marriage (during which she gave birth to two children), she joined the Polizia di Stato and was initially assigned to a police station in Milan. She was later transferred first to the mobile squad and later to the Special VIP protection service at Palermo. In January 1989, while on duty, Valent stated that a visibly drunken man insulted her with heavily racist remarks, refusing to hand her documents for identification and assaulting her physically. During this incident, Valent was on patrol with two male colleagues who Valent accused of being negligent in helping her and who attempted to minimize the incident, as the assaulter was drunk. Valent denounced the supposed irregular behaviour of her colleagues to the media and through this incident, coupled with her background, she gained solidarity as well as experiencing a wide popularity. As an activist of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), Valent was candidated with the support of the then Secretary Achille Occhetto to the European Parliament and was elected in the 1989 elections with about 76,000 votes. Her position as an Independent MEP of the PCI caused some friction with the Party Board. Particularly famous was the diplomatic row with the Government of the State of Israel which, in a 1990 column on the magazine \\"Avvenimenti\\" was deemed as «the most racist Government in the world» and compared to the Third Reich. The outrage sparked by these statements, allegedly forced the Israeli Ambassador in Italy, Mordechai Drory, to file an official written complaint to Achille Occhetto, who distanced himself and the PCI from Valent's statements. At Strasbourg Dacia Valent was a member of the Commission on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights (1989–1992), of the Joint Assembly of the Convention between the ACP and the EEC (1989–1994), and of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs (1992). Following the dissolution of the PCI and its subsequent transformation into the Democratic Party of the Left, she decided not to join the new political entity but she rather chose to be enrolled in the Communist Refoundation Party. After some time she was expelled from the party for her declaration of admiration to the former neo-fascist politician Gianfranco Fini, leader of right-wing party Alleanza Nazionale. Dacia Valent tried unsuccessfully to run for a seat under the Alleanza Nazionale party, and finally was candidated to the European elections of 2004 with the list of Antonio Di Pietro getting 583 preferences without being elected. On 26 July 1992, Dacia Valent founded a non- governmental organization known as SCORE and was nominated Chairwoman of it. In 1995 as a member of that group, she supported the action of a group of Somali women who denounced requests for sexual favors by the CGIL trade union in exchange for concessions in the allocation of food, but the CGIL denied the circumstances and Dacia Valent was found guilty of defamation after a Court trial. In April 1995 she was arrested for the attempted murder of Luc Tchombé Mutshail, a citizen of Zaire with whom she had a child; Tchombé was injured by Valent with a knife during a fight. Later in 2002, she was sanctioned by the Italian Comptroller and Auditor General for improper administration of the money invested from the Italian Government into SCORE which was meant instead to be used to build temporary sojourn and assistance centres for illegal immigrants.Sentenza n. 603 del 25 febbraio 2002, Corte dei Conti. For these reason she lost the opportunity to be nominated in the Berlusconi government as a Minister of Immigration. Later, after her supposed conversion to Islam, she founded an organization called Islamic Anti-Defamation League. Among its initiatives, the organization provided a telephone support and advisory service for Muslims who wished to report abuse issues based on religious discrimination. The toll free number, however, ceased to be operational shortly after. In November 2006, Dacia Valent was indicted for aiding and abetting in a robbery against a Polish immigrant who had turned to SCORE for help. In October 2007, she was sentenced to one year in jail and a 15,000 euro fine for defamation and threats against the former director of Telepadania. In October 2008, an article published on her personal blog, titled \\"Italians bastards, shitty Italians\\", which reportedly featured a number of derogatory comments against Italians (specified also as «whites and Christians») ignited some strong outrage from the press. In January 2010, she acquired the political portal Kilombo.org, an aggregator of blogs. In 2012, she underwent another Criminal Court trial for repeatingly defaming the Moroccan-born politician Souad Sbai and she was found guilty as charged. On 22 January 2015, Dacia Valent died in Rome from a heart attack, while she was hospitalized for other health issues.

His views are considered controversial in some parts of the Cuban exile community in Miami. debarred in 2018 U.S.-Cuban Relations Duran was a member of Brigade 2506 (Brigada Asalto 2506), a group of Cuban exiles trained by the CIA in preparation for the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba and the planned overthrow of its prime minister, Fidel Castro. Duran was captured during the conflict, and spent 18 months in prison in Cuba, before being ransomed by U.S. organizations and businesses.Fidel Castro, Aurelio Martínez -Historia de una agresión: Declaraciones y documentos del juicio 1962 \\"... José Manuel Fausto González Mercier, Adalbelio González, Rodolfo González Blau, Alberto García Navarro Mayor, Ramón Frank González Fernández, Luis González Padilla, Alfredo González Durán, José Ramón Gutiérrez Mendieta, Jorge García ...\\" After his release in December 1962, Duran remained active in anti-Castro circles and joined the Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506, serving as president two years in a row. During the late 1980s, Duran began to have private misgivings about the advisability of a military solution to obtaining regime change in Cuba. Duran did not go public with his doubts until the early 1990s, after the fall of Soviet Union. Duran's former comrades were outraged that a former president of the Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506 was advocating peaceful dialogue with the communist government of Cuba. Duran told Frontline: \\"To the right wing or more conservative community here in Miami, a dialogado is the worst thing that you could be called. It implies that you're a traitor.\\" The Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506 expelled Duran in a public rebuke in 1993. Following the expulsion, Duran founded the Cuban Committee for Democracy, that seeks to bring democracy to Cuba through dialogue and peaceful means. In March 2001, Duran made a visit to the site of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, accompanied by Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Richard N. Goodwin, Wayne S. Smith, Jean Kennedy Smith (sister of John F. Kennedy), and others. The 60-member American delegation was taking part in a conference in Havana, titled Bay of Pigs: 40 Years After, marking the 40th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The conference was organized by the University of Havana and the National Security Archives, a nonprofit group based in Washington, D.C., that strives to declassify government documents on U.S. foreign policy decisions. During that 2001 visit to Cuba, Duran met with José Ramón Fernández, who is now a vice president of the Cuban Council of Ministers but who, in April 1961, was the executive commander (directly reporting to Fidel Castro) in charge of Cuba's defending forces during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Duran called that encounter \\"very emotional.\\" Duran has publicly called for an end on all travel restrictions to Cuba. As he said on PBS NewsHour: > We must absolutely lift all restrictions for Americans to travel to Cuba. > It's a constitutional right of all Americans to be—it must be protected > under the laws of this country. And I think that if Cuban-Americans are > allowed to go, Americans should be allowed to go. > And I think that's going to have a tremendous impact, because the travel of > Americans is not like the travel of Europeans or Canadians. Cubans play > baseball; they don't play hockey. And our cultural nearness is very similar. > You go to Cuba right now, and it's like the Russians had never gone by > there. You go to Cuba right now, and you still can feel the influence of our > American tradition in the past and our cultural nearness. Personal life Duran was born in Havana in 1939, the son of Ana Durán. In 1941, Duran's mother married Anselmo Alliegro y Milá, a Cuban senator and government minister. It was Alliegro, then president of the Senate, who accepted Fulgencio Batista's resignation on Dec. 31, 1958, and then took refuge, with his family, in the Chilean Embassy in Havana for three months. After spending two additional months in Chile itself, the family permanently arrived in Miami. Duran had first come to the United States to study at Valley Forge Military Academy and Louisiana State University. He was graduated from LSU with a bachelor's in science degree in 1957. After Duran's release from prison, he received his law degree from the University of Miami in 1967. In 1973, Duran became the first Hispanic American to serve on the Dade County School Board when he was appointed by Reubin Askew, Governor of Florida. He also served on the Dade Community Relations Board and the Urban League. Duran has long been active in Democratic Party politics, including serving on the National Democratic Committee. Duran was chairman of the Florida Democratic Party from 1976 to 1980. Duran has two sons, Alfredo R. and Alfredo J., from his first marriage. He married his second wife, María Elena Prío Tarrero, the daughter of former Cuban President Carlos Prío Socarrás on Feb. 19, 1972. An item in a Miami News news social column characterized the wedding as \\"the union of two of Cuba's most powerful political families.\\" The couple has since divorced.

It is situated about 7 miles west of Kanchipuram and half a kilometre from Baluchetti Chattiram which lies on the Chennai - Vellore highway. The place is known after the Vijayaraghava Perumal temple. History The history of the place is surrounded around the Vijayaraghava Perumal temple. The temple is believed to have been built by the Pandya kings during the 13th century, as seen from the stone inscriptions in the temple. The temple here is one among the 108 Divya Desams and is dedicated to Lord Vijayaraghavaswamy (Moolavar). There is a separate temple for Thayar in the form of Margathavalli Thayar and a sannidhi for Sri Ramanuja as well.  Legend  Temple Tank|250px|left|thumb Legend says that Sri Rama left all of his properties and went to the forest as ordered by his father. While in the forest, Sita spots a golden deer and requests Rama to catch it for her. The deer however is a demon sent by Ravana to lure Rama and Lakshmana, so that he could carry away Sita. With Rama and Lakshmana out in search of the deer, Ravana abducts Sita and takes her along with him to Lanka. On the way to Lanka, Jatayu the vulture stops Ravana and fights with him to release Sita, but Ravana cuts Jatayu's wings and he falls down to the earth. When Rama and Lakshmana go there in search of Sita, they find Jatayu mortally wounded in the forest. Jatayu tells them about Ravana and Sita, and then dies. Sri Rama then performs the last rites for Jatayu. As suggested by Jatayu, the Perumal here gives his seva in the form in which he performed the final funeral of Jatayu. Jatayu belongs to the Pul (a separate family of eagle) family and was buried in a pit (Tamil kuzhi), hence this sthalam is called Thiruputkuzhi. The eagle Jatayu narrated the events to Rama before breathing his last. The presiding deity, Vijayaraghava Perumal is believed to have performed the last rites of Jataya at this place. The water body where Jatayu fell is called Jatayu Theertham.

It is associated with magical powers in South Asia. This horn usually measures half an inch in length, and is concealed by fur. In the 1800s, the natives of Sri Lanka called this growth narric-comboo, and both Tamil and Sinhalese people traditionally believe it to be a potent amulet which can grant wishes and reappear to its owner at its own accord when lost. Some Sinhalese believe that the horn can grant the holder invulnerability in any lawsuit. According to healers and witch doctors in Nepal, a jackal horn can be used to win in gambling bouts, and ward off evil spirits. The Tharu people of Bardia (Nepal) believe that jackal horns are retractible, and only protrude when jackals howl in chorus. A hunter who manages to extract the horn will place it in a silver casket of vermilion powder, which is thought to give the object sustenance. The Tharu believe that the horn can grant the owner the ability to see in the dark.Mammals of Nepal: (with reference to those of Pakiatan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and India) by Tej Kumar Shrestha, published by Steven Simpson Books, 1997, In some areas, the horn is called Seear Singhi or \\"Geedhar Singhi\\" the word \\"Geedhar\\" is the Urdu translation of Jackal and (the root words being the Persian \\"seah\\" meaning black, and \\"Singh\\" which means horn in Hindi and Urdu) and is tied to the necks of children.

Its course is quite similar to that of European route E40 between Brussels and Aachen, which it intersects 3 times. The road runs through the 3 Belgian regions (Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia) and the 3 communities (Dutch- speaking, French-speaking and German-speaking). Starting at the small Brussels ring road crossroad Arts-Loi in the City of Brussels, the road is first named Rue de la Loi (direction Brussels centrum) or Rue Belliard (direction Aachen), then enters the Belliard tunnel under the Cinquantenaire park before it becomes the Avenue de Tervueren/Tervurenlaan past the Tervuren gate in Etterbeek. The Avenue de Tervueren then crosses the municipality of Woluwe- Saint-Pierre from the Montgomery Place, passes along the Woluwe and Parmentier parks before it joins the Chaussée de Tervueren/Tervuursesteenweg in Auderghem. Past this intersection, the N3 road comes back to Woluwe-Saint- Pierre where it crosses the Brussels Ring after which it leaves the region of Brussels for Flanders in Tervuren, Flemish Brabant. Before it arrives to Leuven where it joins the N2 road on the Leuven Ring, the road crosses highways E40 in Bertem and E314 in Heverlee, a borough of Leuven. Between Leuven and Tienen the N3 road runs parallel to the E40 and the railroad Leuven-Tienen. Arriving in Sint-Truiden, the road enters the province of Limburg and leaves it for the Walloon province of Liège at Oreye. It intersects the E40 highway again at Loncin and then runs through the city centre of Liège and crosses the river Meuse there. Going north-east the road intersects the E40 for the 3rd time in Soumagne. The N3 finally crosses 2 municipalities of the German-speaking community (Lontzen and Kelmis).

As the Boeing 707 was at 80 knots, the instruments for No. 4 engine indicated zero thrust and the thrust reverser deployment light for No. 2 engine illuminated. The crew aborted the takeoff at a speed below V1 at 800-900m down the runway. The aircraft did not slow down as quickly as the crew expected and veered to the right, whereupon No. 4 engine struck a pavement roller. The aircraft caught fire and traveled another 260m before coming to rest. The accident killed 50 passengers and crew on board, with 23 passengers and crew surviving. A prominent passenger was the Most Reverend Edward Celestin Daly, OP, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Des Moines, Iowa, in the United States; he was killed in this crash. He had just participated in Vatican Council II. Cause 230px The cause of the accident was an inoperative No. 2 engine reverse thrust system, even though indications in the cockpit were that the reverser had deployed. This was caused by the disconnection of a duct with resulting lack of pressure in the pneumatic clamshell door actuating mechanism. This malfunction allowed the development of considerable forward thrust by No. 2 engine even though the thrust levers for all four engines were in the \\"reverse\\" position. More information about this accident can be found in a book published in 1967, called \\"Airline Safety is a Myth\\". It was written by the captain of this aircraft, Vernon William Lowell. He survived the accident and went on to become a passionate advocate for improved safety in airline travel.

It was entered into the 13th Berlin International Film Festival. The film is about a group of old friends in Milan, all men in their late thirties, celebrating a chance reunion at a cinema in the suburbs (managed by one of them), and looking for encounters with women. Plot Alberto and Sandrino, two old friends, meet by chance on the streets of Milan after many years. After a moment of embarrassment, memories and the light-heartedness of the past resurface. Sandrino offers to track down the others - Cesarino, Nino and Livio - and spend an evening like in the good old days. Cesarino, who back in the old days was the animator of the group who got them into contact with girls, has not lost much in this sense although he faces economic difficulties. He manages a small cinema in the suburbs for his uncle, where the other friends go after having dinner. The evening passes between telephone calls of a pranky nature, car rides, and meetings of bizarre character. In the early morning, Cesarino decides to track down Lara, who had spent time with the group. As the friends now find out, she had gotten arrested for a diamond robbery which she committed shortly after leaving the group, spent two years in jail, and now has become a street prostitute. Cesarino reaffirms her love for her, but when she sees the other friends watching them kiss, she runs away and joins her regular customers, the truckers. In wanting to redeem her, Cesarino runs after the truck and jumps on it. A fistfight with two truckers ensues, and Cesarino ends up beaten up and bleeding. Lara, saddened by this, still stays with the truckers, and Cesarino is taken care of by his friends. He finally leaves the group in a sad mood. Alberto promises he will ring him up, but although Cesarino appreciates the gesture, it feels as though he suspects he never will do so.

The season was produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studios, Paper Kite Productions and Polka Dot Pictures, and series co-creators Amy Poehler, Cynthia True and Erik Wiese served as executive producers. The series focuses on Bessie Higgenbottom (Poehler), an ambitious Honeybee scout with a dream of earning more badges than any other Honeybee, and turning into her superhero alter-ego The Mighty B. The season consisted of 38 eleven-minute segments, and one half-hour final titled \\"Dragonflies\\". Poehler, True and Wiese had been developing the series several years before its premiere. They talked about making a \\"female-driven\\" animated series, and it was picked up by Nickelodeon in early 2006 under the name of Super Scout. The season received generally positive reviews. One reviewer called Bessie the \\"female answer to SpongeBob SquarePants\\". 1.92 million viewers among Kids 2–11 watched the series premiere, and the series averaged 3.1 million viewers each episode during the season. Episodes Note: All episodes in Season 1 were directed by Erik Wiese & Larry Leichliter Production Amy Poehler co-created the show and provides the voice of Bessie. Conception Several years before The Mighty B! premiered, co- creator Amy Poehler and her friends at Nickelodeon talked about making a \\"female-driven\\" animated television series. Poehler stated; \\"where this girl is at that great age [...] where you're not boy-crazy and you're not mean to other girls\\". She found that enthusiasm \\"fascinating\\" and wanted to \\"bottle it and take it like a pill\\". Bessie is loosely based on a character Poehler had played during her time at improvisational comedy troupes Second City and Upright Citizens Brigade as well as girls she looked up to when she was younger. She described Bessie as a \\"feisty, plucky, bossy, Honey Bee scout\\". The Mighty B! was picked up for a pilot in early 2006 under the name of Super Scout. It was co-created by Poehler, Cynthia True and Erik Wiese. Brown Johnson, president of animation at Nickelodeon, was \\"absolutely thrilled to have a comedy team of the caliber of Amy, Erik and Cynthia create this iconic character for a new generation\\". Cast Amy Poehler voices Bessie Higgenbottom, a 9¾ year old Honeybee scout. Poehler describes her as \\"superoptimistic and a super spaz\\" and \\"a bit bossy, but with good intentions\\". She is based on a character Poehler had played during her time at improvisational comedy troupes Second City and Upright Citizens Brigade, but also girls Poehler looked up to when she was younger, which she called \\"the leaders\\". Poehler provides the voice of Bessie only, but for the episode \\"Boston Beean\\", she provided the voice of Sissy Sullivan, a foreign Honeybee scout from Boston whose voice sounded exactly like Bessie's. Dee Bradley Baker voices Happy, Bessie's dog which she found at the harbor in the first episode \\"So Happy Together\\". Andy Richter voices Ben Higgenbottom, Bessie's younger brother. Richter is also the voice of Mort on the Nick show The Penguins of Madagascar. Richter talked about The Mighty B!, quoting: \\"[...] another dream come true, to be able to do cartoon voices! And, also, to get to do cartoon voices for [Ben and Mort] two really funny, cool cartoons that my kids love and that I'm proud to have them love. It's pretty great.\\" Dannah Feinglass voices Penny, Bessie's sidekick. Feinglass is also a writer for the show. Grey DeLisle voices Portia Gibbons, a Honeybee scout, Megan Cavanagh voices Hilary Higgenbottom, Bessie and Ben's single mother, Sarah Thyre voices Mary Frances Gibbons, Portia's mother, and Jessica DiCicco voices Gwen, Portia's friend. Reception Critical reception The season received generally positive reviews from television sources and critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said that the show \\"has the kind of crazed energy and inventiveness that isn't associated often enough with girl-oriented children's fare [...] The Mighty B! opts for a more elevated approach – like that aforementioned roller-coaster jaunt, taking a free-spirited jump off the tracks and trusting its audience to hang on for the ride.\\" David Hinckley of Daily News gave the show four stars, stating: \\"The Mighty B! has a decent shot at becoming a pre-tween fave.\\" Aaron H. Bynum of Animation Insider called the show a \\"good, brainless cartoon [...] Viewers shouldn't ever be bored with Bessie [but] the comedy really doesn't try to do too much, which may ultimately work against it when the story calls for the characters to do too little. Joanne Ostrow of the Denver Post called Bessie the \\"female answer to SpongeBob SquarePants\\". Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the show three stars out of five, saying: \\"The show maintains a chaotic pace, and there are no real attempts to teach strong positive lessons [...] Young tweens will likely enjoy Bessie's outlandish, fantasy- fueled adventures – which are fast-paced and, on the surface, entertaining.\\" Ed Liu of Toon Zone called The Mighty B! a show that he admires more than he \\"truly love[s]\\", stating: \\"There is prodigious talent behind it and its wonderfully energetic, boisterous comedy. It's clearly trying very, very hard to be entertaining and largely succeeds [...] I almost feel bad for not liking The Mighty B! more than I do, and I'm still not sure why I don't enjoy it more\\". He also said that it was worth pointing out that more recent episodes of the show seem \\"more assured and funnier\\" than the eight episodes on the We Got the Bee DVD. Ratings The Mighty B! premiered at 10:30am on April 26, 2008, and scored \\"above average for Nickelodeon programming\\" in the Nielsen ratings. It ranked in the top ten of all programming for combined broadcast and basic cable shows, with 1.92 million viewers in the Kids 2–11 demographic and a rating of 5.2/23. The Mighty B! had double the viewership as Bakugan Battle Brawlers, a show that aired simultaneously on Cartoon Network. In September 2008, the show had an average of 3.1 million viewers, and in the second quarter of 2008, the show ranked among the top five animated programs on television. During the third quarter of 2009, it averaged 2.6 million viewers, and was number-one in its timeslot in the kids 2–11 and kids 6–11 demographics. DVD releases A DVD called We Got The Bee was released on February 24, 2009. It contained eight episodes, behind the scenes footage, an animatic version of the episode \\"Bat Mitzvah Crashers\\" and a karaoke music video for \\"Running with the Rainbow Unicorn\\". A second DVD called BEEing Bessie Higgenbottom was released on December 8, 2009, where it contained seven episodes, a karaoke music video for \\"Buzz Off\\", an animatic of the episode \\"Bee Patients\\", and audio commentary of the episodes of \\"Bee Patients\\", \\"Ben Appetit\\", and \\"Name Shame\\", provided by Amy Poehler, Andy Richter, Dee Bradley Baker, Grey DeLisle, Erik Wiese, and Eddie Trigueros.

The river used to be wrongly considered as a tributary of Pamba River before satellite maps became popular, but this is incorrect. Manimala does not flow into Pamba, but a branch of Pamba flows into Manimala from Kuthiathode and joins Manimala at Kallunkal, later branches out at again from Manimala at Nedumpuram and flows through Niranam, Thalavady, Edathua, Changankary, Champakulam, Nedumudy, Chennamkary, and finally Kainakary and empties into Vembanad lake. This branch again links with Manimala river at Chennankary in a short, but broad connection known as Munnattumukham. Manimala is a separate independent river for all geographical purposes. It has its origin on the Muthavara Hills (1156 feet above main sea level) on the Western Ghats, It is with a length of about 90 km and a catchment area of about 847 km2. in Idukki district of Kerala, India. The river passes through the districts of Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts.

Manimala splits after Kidangara into two branches. Second branch flows via Kunnamkary, Kavalam and Kainakary to Vembanad lake. Its running length is estimated at 92 km. It empties itself into the Vembanad Lake. It is one of the four major rivers which do not have direct outlet to sea as these rivers (Meenachil, Pamba, Manimala, Achankovil) empty into the vast Vembanad lake. This huge lake has just two outlets, one at Thottappaly Spillway and second at Thannermukkom Bund, both man made barriers, built to prevent incoming seawater during high tides, which otherwise would render the low lying paddyfields (average 2.5 meters below sea level) uncultivable. Niranam is historically known as an ancient inland port at the confluence of Manimala River and Pamba River. At Kaviyoor ancient rock-cut cave temples can still be seen. Manimala River has been an important water way of Central Travancore. Rising in the hills of Kottayam-Idukki ranges, running westward, the river joins the plains at Manimala junction and then the flows through the midland plains and through the Kuttanad rice bowl area. Sand mining on the river bed has led to depletion of the water ways of the river. Pollution is also another issue.

It was based on the engine and chassis of a Fiat 850 Coupe  History  Introduced in 1965 at the Turin Motor Show, the Sport was Moretti’s last car that could be customised beyond the usual of choice of seat colours. There was the possibility to obtain trim and equipment levels of great prestige for the age according to the buyer’s taste. The Sport was initially proposed as a two-seater coupé although it became available as a convertible. The original sport had dual headlights, although a dealer from Switzerland fitted two sports with quad headlights to resemble the not yet available Fiat Dino. Rear end  Specifications  Sportiva interior The Sportiva was originally offered with an 850 cc engine producing around at 6,000 rpm. The standard engine was later enlarged to 982 cc. Due to the aerodynamic profile, it was necessary to mount the spare wheel horizontally in the front luggage area, occupying it entirely. Therefore, the designers had to create a luggage compartment, made from a stiff cloth, between the seats and the engine space. The lack of rear seats was unappreciated by purchasers and in the successive year, Moretti introduced the S4 four seater.  Production  Approximately 300 examples of the Sport were produced in various forms (around 52 examples of the Moretti Sportiva S2). The base price for the Moretti Sport in 1967 was 1.095.000 Liras which could increase with personalisation to nearly two million Lira. In comparison, the more luxurious and modern Fiat 124 in the same year had a list price of 1.035.000 Liras.

In population dynamics, recruitment is the process by which new individuals are added to a population, whether by birth and maturation or by immigration. When discussing behavioral ecology and animal communication, recruitment refers to communication that is intended to add members of a group to specific tasks. Finally, when discussing cell biology, recruitment refers to the process by which cells are selected for certain tasks.  Recruitment in population dynamics   Definition and importance  In population dynamics and community ecology, recruitment is the process by which individuals are added to a population. Successful recruitment is contingent on an individual surviving and integrating within the population; in some studies, individuals are only considered to have been recruited into a population once they've reached a certain size or life stage. Recruitment can be hard to assess due to the multitude of factors that affect it, such as predation, birth, and dispersal rates and environmental factors like temperature, precipitation, and natural disturbances. Recruitment rates in turn affect population size and demographics. High recruitment may increase a species' current and future abundance within a system, whereas low recruitment can lead to reduced current and future abundance.  Common study systems   Aquatic systems  Recruitment can be an important factor in predicting future population growth potential. For this reason, and due to their economic importance, recruitment has commonly been studied in fishery systems. While experimental work has been done in aquatic systems, dozens of papers have been published in the last few decades to model recruitment in both marine and freshwater aquatic environments.  Forest systems  Experimental studies on the effects of recruitment are numerous in forest and annual plant systems.  Recruitment in behavioral ecology  In behavioral ecology and studies of animal communication, recruitment is the process by which individuals in a social group direct other individuals to do certain tasks. This is often achieved through the use of recruitment pheromones that direct anywhere from one to several hundred individuals to important resources, like food or nesting sites. Recruitment is practiced in a wide variety of eusocial taxa, most notably in hymenoptera (the ants, bees, and wasps) and termites but also in social caterpillars, beetles, and even a species of naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber).

Date: Oct 1940; Name: Enrica Clay Dillon; Birth Date: 22 Jun 1885; Birth Place: Denver, Colorado; Father: Henry C Dillon; Mother: Florence Hood Dillon was the daughter of Judge Henry Clay Dillon and Florence (née Hood) Dillon. She was the older sister of composer Fanny Dillon and actress Josephine Dillon; the latter of whom was married to Clark Gable for 6 years. Dillon studied voice at Mount Holyoke College and with baritone Francesco Mottino in Milan. She had a prolific career as a dramatic soprano in Europe during the first decade and a half of the 20th century, giving more than 1,800 opera performances. She was especially active in Italy and sang at most of the principle houses in that country, including La Scala. She was particularly known for her portrayal of the title role in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida.Enrica Clay Dillon obituary, Variety (October 16, 1946), p. 62. Dillon abandoned her singing career shortly before the outbreak of World War I; largely due to continual bouts with illness. She then served as the first director of the Washington Opera Company from 1919 to 1927. She moved to Philadelphia in 1927, where for three years she taught singing and was director of the Philadelphia Operatic Society. From 1930-35, she worked for Herbert Witherspoon as a vocal coach and stage director at first the Chicago Civic Opera and then the Chicago Grand Opera Company. She also maintained a home in New York City during the 1930s where she had a voice studio and directed operas for the New York Singing Teachers Association and the New York Opera Guild. Beginning in 1916, Dillon spent her summers in the state of Maine where she ran an opera and voice training program for aspiring singers at Frederick Bristol's music camp just outside Harrison, Maine. Her regular students from Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City would often come up with her to study at the school. Among her notable pupils were Richard Crooks, Marie Sundelius, Kathryn Meisle, and Frederick Jagel, and musical theatre actress Evelyn Herbert. In 1936, Dillon founded the Deertrees Theatre in Harrison, which was later the home of Dillon's Deertree Opera Company (DOC). The DOC presented its first season in 1940. Many theatres were closed down during World War II, and the opera company only presented three seasons of performances before the theatre was closed in 1942. Metropolitan Opera conductor Karl Kritz served as the company's music director and primary conductor. Hermann Weigert also served on the company's conducting staff. Notable singers to have performed with the company included a young Astrid Varnay just prior to her triumphant Met debut and soprano Elisabeth Carron in her professional opera debut. Death At the time of her death in Harrison, Maine, Dillon was in the midst of organizing a summer opera festival to be held in July 1947, after already presenting a summer opera festival in 1946, at the re-opened Deertree Theatre.

Indications Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is of interest to women who want fertility preservation beyond the natural limit, or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy, for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer. It can be performed on prepubertal girls at risk for premature ovarian failure, and this procedure is as feasible and safe as comparable operative procedures in children. Procedure Placing ovarian tissue strips into the preserving solution Cryopreserving ovarian tissue strips The procedure is to take a part of the ovary and carry out slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen whilst therapy is undertaken. Tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian, either orthotopic (on the natural location) or heterotopic (on the abdominal wall), where it starts to produce new eggs, allowing normal conception to take place.Livebirth after orthotopic transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue The Lancet, Sep 24, 2004 A study of 60 procedures concluded that ovarian tissue harvesting appears to be safe. A study has also concluded that culturing a thawed fetal ovarian tissue for a few days before transplanting can be beneficial to the development of follicles. Strips of cortical ovarian tissue can also be cryopreserved, but it must be re-implanted into the body to allow the encapsulated immature follicles to complete their maturation. In vitro maturation has been performed experimentally, but the technique is not yet clinically available. Further comments in BBC news article: With this technique, cryopreserved ovarian tissue could possibly be used to make oocytes that can directly undergo in vitro fertilization. Potential for Pregnancy Women suffering from malignant diseases that undergo treatment utilizing irradiation or gonadotoxic drugs, have an increase probability of losing ovarian function resulting in infertility. The ovarian cortical tissue harbors majority of the ovarian pool of follicles. Once a patient is cured from their malignant disease, the tissue can be thawed and then transplanted for the possibility of restoring ovarian function. Following auto-transplantation, patients showed resumption of ovarian activity to include the first menstruation at 14 to 25 weeks, and follicular development 8 to 21 weeks. Andersen, C. Y., et al. “Two Successful Pregnancies Following Autotransplantation of Frozen/Thawed Ovarian Tissue.” Human Reproduction, vol. 23, no. 10, Aug. 2008, pp. 2266–2272. Oxford Academy , doi:10.1093/humrep/den244 Risk of cancer recurrence For autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue in cancer survivors, metastases have been repeatedly detected in ovarian tissue obtained from patients with leukemia, as well as in one patient with Ewing sarcoma. Ovarian tissue autotransplantation may pose a risk of cancer recurrence in patients with colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancer. However, no metastases have been detected in ovarian tissue from lymphoma and breast cancer patients who have been undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreseration. History First ovarian transplant with cryopreserved ovarian tissue was performed by Dr Kutluk Oktay in 1999. In Sep 2004 Prof Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from slow, or controlled rate, frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997 samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cryo-preserved in a rate freezer (Planer, UK)and stored in liquid Nitrogen. Chemotherapy was initiated and after the patient had premature ovarian failure. In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and five months after reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after re-implantation a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in a live birth – Tamara. There has, however, been a great deal of controversy surrounding the Louvain claim. Colleagues refute the claims by Donnez, stating that it is not sure whether the mother was indeed infertile. The first birth following transplantation of ovarian tissue, which has been stored at a central cryo bank after overnight transport, has been achieved by centers of the Fertiprotekt network in Germany 2011. This demonstrated that ovarian tissue can be stored centrally in specialized centers.Ralf Dittrich, Laura Lotz, Gudrun Keck, Inge Hoffmann, Andreas Mueller, Matthias W.

Cuttack Tarkasi (silver filigree) pendant & ear rings Origin Tarkasi workers photo before 200 years in British library This highly skilled art form is more than 500 years old and is traditionally done by local artisans on the Eastern shores of Odisha. Presently, the silver filigree workers are largely from the district of Cuttack, where the art flourishes. Technique The filigree artists work with an alloy of 90% or more pure silver. First, the lump of silver is placed into a small clay pot and the two are put into a bucket full of hot coals. The temperature is regulated through a bellows that is hand operated by a crank. The melting process takes about ten minutes and then the silver is poured into a small, rod-like mold and cooled by submerging the rod in water. It is then placed into a machine that will press the rod into a long, thin wire. This tedious and physically demanding process had been done traditionally by hand and took two men to turn the crank. Once the silver is pressed into a flat, workable wire, the wire itself can first be hand carved with intricate designs or immediately smoldered by a small kerosene fire with one artist directing the small flame with a tube held in his mouth into which he can blow. This process makes it easier for the artisan to mold the wire into the desired frame for the piece before it is cooled. Next the wires are strung together and twisted and shaped into a design by the artist’s precise fingers. Soldering is done by placing the piece into a mixture of borax powder and water, sprinkling soldering powder on it, and then placing it once again under the small flame. This insures that the detail of the design will stay intact. Once this is done, the artist will take the warm piece and shape it into an ornament. Techniques such as granulation, snow glazing and casting are used innovatively to heighten the effect. Artisan Jagdish Mishra, speaking of the techniques employed says, \\"The tastes of the customers keep changing and artists must be up to date with to keep up with emerging trends\\". Such new methods and experimentation are increasingly being employed to produce highly polished and refined artifacts in keeping with the demands of customers. Platinum polishing is done to give a more lasting shine whereas fusion of silver and brass or other materials is done to create interesting effects. Tradition Forms of animals, birds, flowers and even miniature handbags and other souvenirs are made in Tarakasi work. The Konark Chakra and temple are great favorites as mementos. Scenes from the Mahabharata, in particular the still from the Bhagavad Gita depicting the chariot of Arjuna driven by Lord Krishna are quite popular. Over the years various famous monuments like the TajMahal, Eiffel Tower etc. has been made, garnering accolades from admirers of fine arts The filigree jewelry is particularly rich in patterns. In Odisha, the stress is on arm jewelry, necklaces, toe rings and especially anklets, which are a great favorite. They are considered auspicious as well. Intricate anklets, combining use of semi-precious stones are greatly preferred. The Bela-Kanta, a traditional ornament. Vermillion boxes, brooches, pendants, earrings and hairpins are in great demand. Vermillion box is must in any Oriya marriage, but this tradition dying out. Waist band made from Tarakasi work were used traditionally in the marriage. Oriya marriages are incomplete without Tarakasi anklets and toe rings. Odissi The jewelry worn in Odissi, one of the classical dances of India originating from Odisha, are made from Tarakasi work. These ornaments adorn the head, ear, neck, hands, fingers and waist of the dancer. The ornaments include a choker, ‘padaka-tilaka’ (a long necklace), ‘bahichudi’ or ‘tayila’ (armlets), ‘kankana’ (bracelets), a 'mekhalaa' (belt), anklets, bells, ’kapa’ (earrings) and a ‘seenthi’ (ornament work on the hair and forehead). These ornaments are embellished with natural un-cut stones lined with silver and gold. Durga puja Silver filigree work at Chaudhury Bazar Durga Puja pandal Cuttack The introduction of the Sharadiya Utsav tradition in the city dates back to the visit of Saint Chaitanya in the 16th century when the consecration of the idol of Durga by using the mask pattern was conducted in his presence at Binod Behari Devi Mandap. Every year, during Durga Puja in [Cuttack], Tarakasi jewelry is used at many pandals to embellish the idols of Durga. One of the most famous idols is the one at Chandni Chowk, where the entire crown and accessories of Durga are made of silver, popularly known as Chaandi Medha. Other pandals using Tarakasi are Chauliaganj, Choudhury Bazar, Khan Nagar, Banka Bazar, Balu Bazar etc. Every year more than 150 filigree artisans are engaged in making backdrop and ornament design. The style was introduced at the Choudhury Bazaar puja pandal with a 250 kg chandi medha in 1956. Following suit, Sheikh Bazaar puja mandap installed a 350 kg chandi medha in 1991. In 2004, Ranihat puja committee joined the elite group with a 483 kg of silver filigree backdrop, jewelry and weaponry. In the following year, Haripur-Dolamundai puja committee superseded Ranihat when it installed 500 kg silver filigree. In 2006, the Sheikh Bazaar committee remodeled a new backdrop using 450 kg of silver. Chandini Chowk, Sheikh Bazaar, Alisha Bazaar, Chauliaganj, Badambadi, Ranihat, Haripur-Dolamundai and Balu Bazaar-Binod Behari puja committees are vouching for the filigree work. There is a competition to notch the best show every year among all puja committees in Cuttack.

Plot The Scavo family is preparing for Preston's return from Europe. When he arrives from the airport, however, they are surprised to find his European souvenir is not only a new moustache but is also Irina (Helena Mattsson), a beautiful Russian girl who Lynette says is \\"out of his league\\". Later, Lynette and Tom discover that while in Paris Preston helped pay for Irina to undergo selective surgery, and showers her with nice things. While Tom seems fine with this, Lynette is not, and is worried that her son is being manipulated. The next evening, Preston tells his parents that he has proposed to Irina and she has said yes. He asks for his grandmother's cherished ring that Lynette promised to him when he gets engaged. Lynette does not want to give the ring to Preston for fear that the marriage will not last. She goes to a jewellery shop and asks the salesclerk to make a glass replica of the ring, hoping that when Irina receives it she will have it appraised and leave Preston, thinking he is out of money. However, Irina is a smart girl, and instead of leaving she returns the ring to Lynette saying she couldn't possibly take a family heirloom, and asks Lynette to save it for Penny. She then tells Preston he can buy her a new ring, and exchanges a threatening look with Lynette. Gabrielle is approached by Angie, who is taking a cab to New York to find Danny. Gaby tags along after discovering that Ana knows she sabotaged her relationship with Danny by bribing her with modeling. In New York, Gaby reveals to Angie that she used to be a model. She introduces her to Heidi Klum, who wants nothing to do with Gaby due to a stunt Gaby pulled that lost Heidi a cover on Sports Illustrated way back when. Later, at a restaurant, Gaby runs into her old agent and Paulina Porizkova, and is shocked to find Paulina despises her as well due to Gaby acting like a spoiled brat on a photo shoot the two did together in Brazil. Gaby's agent, Luke, tells her that she was the \\"queen bitch\\" during her reign of New York, and everyone got sick of it. Gaby says she didn't realize how mean she was when Luke reminds her that she left modeling not because she fell in love, but because she knew Carlos was wealthy and could financially support her when she knew her career was ending. Gaby insists this isn't true, but Luke says it is, and because he's her friend he encouraged her to marry him, because he didn't want to see her lose everything. After a self- evaluation, Gaby decides to change her attitude for good, and pushes Ana, who quit modeling, to try again so as not to waste her one shot. While at Angie's mother's home, Gaby tells the old woman next door who Angie is per her inquiring. On the plane ride back home, Gaby learns of Angie's past. Bree's son Andrew becomes increasingly jealous of Sam, especially when Bree promotes Sam to vice president, telling Andrew he can share the job with Sam. At a party for Sam, Andrew gets drunk and pushes him. Sam becomes slightly injured. Bree brings a muffin basket as an apology to Sam's house and finds a picture of him as a toddler with her dead husband, Rex van de Kamp. Demanding an explanation, Bree learns that Sam is Rex's son. Hurt, she goes home, but finds Sam there later that night. She learns from him that Rex got his girlfriend pregnant before leaving her for Bree, and his offer to help financially was turned down. After a couple times of seeing Sam, he stopped because it was too painful. Sam reveals he would drive by the van de Kamp home and watch Bree and Rex and their children, wishing he was part of their home. After Bree learns that Sam's mother died six months ago, she invites him inside so they can drink hot cocoa and talk. An angry looking Andrew watches from the window as the two hug. Susan reveals to Mike she has paid off his loan with money she got from Karl's strip club, which upsets him. Later that day, she pays a visit to Katherine, and discovers that she had sex with Robin. When she tells Mike, she mentions that Katherine probably realized she liked women after being with Mike, saying he is always so gentle when making love. This upsets Mike who insists he is not in touch with his feminine side. To prove this, he later pulls Susan onto the kitchen counter and attempts to rip her shirt off before making love, but finds he cannot tear the shirt and falls off the counter. He tells Susan that when she paid off the loan he felt like he wasn't providing for his family. Susan promises to cancel the check the next day, and the two kiss. Katherine is unsure about her state of mind and whether or not she is a lesbian. She talks to Bob and Lee who insist that because she isn't sure that she isn't lesbian. Katherine takes joy in this, blaming it on intoxication. When Robin arrives home that night, Katherine tells her they only had sex because she was drunk, but hopes to remain friends. Robin doesn't believe that, and insists they had a connection. Robin then kisses Katherine, who agrees. Angie goes with Gabrielle to New York. She meets with her mother, Mrs. DeLuca, whom Danny and Ana have been staying with. Angie wants to take Danny back, but her mother wants Danny to stay with them. Angie tells her Patrick Logan will find them and hurt Danny, Mrs. DeLuca says if there was anyone Patrick would want to hurt it would be Angie, not Danny. Angie then tells her mother a secret she never told her, which convinces her to make Danny go back with Angie. On the plane ride back to Fairview, Angie reveals to Gaby the truth: when she was eighteen, she was very heavily into the environment. She met a bad guy, implied to be Patrick Logan, and someone was killed during their protests. She met Nick and ran off, scared to return. When Gaby asks who the bad man was, Angie replies it was Danny's father. At the end of the episode, the old woman Gaby talked to about Angie makes a phone call to \\"Mr. Logan\\", reminding him that he told her to call should she ever see Mrs. De Luca's daughter in town.

Elephant's toothpaste is a foamy substance caused by the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using potassium iodide or yeast and warm water as a catalyst. How rapidly the reaction proceeds will depend on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Because it requires only a small number of ingredients and makes a \\"volcano of foam\\", this is a popular experiment for children to perform in school or at parties. The experiment is also known as the \\"marshmallow experiment\\", but is unrelated to the psychological Stanford marshmallow experiment. Explanation The variation of elephant's toothpaste experiment with colourants Description About 50 ml of concentrated (>30%) hydrogen peroxide is first mixed with liquid soap or dishwashing detergent. Then, a catalyst, often around 10 ml potassium iodide solution or catalase from baker's yeast, is added to make the hydrogen peroxide decompose very quickly. Hydrogen peroxide breaks down into oxygen and water. As a small amount of hydrogen peroxide generates a large volume of oxygen, the oxygen quickly pushes out of the container. The soapy water traps the oxygen, creating bubbles, and turns into foam. About 5-10 drops of food colouring could also be added before the catalyst to dramatise the effect. How rapidly the reaction occurs will depend on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide used. Chemical explanation This experiment shows the catalysed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposes into water and oxygen gas, which is in the form of foam, but normally the reaction is too slow to be easily perceived or measured: : 2H2O2 -> 2H2O + O2 ^ In normal conditions, this reaction takes place very slowly, therefore a catalyst is added to speed up the reaction, which will result in rapid formation of foam. The iodide ion from potassium iodide acts as a catalyst and speeds up the reaction while remaining chemically unchanged in the reaction process. The iodide ion changes the mechanism by which the reaction occurs: : \\\\begin{array}{llllll} \\\\ce{H2O2} &+\\\\ \\\\ce{I-} &\\\\ce{-> H2O} &+\\\\ \\\\ce{IO-} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{H2O2} &+\\\\ \\\\ce{IO-} &\\\\ce{-> H2O} &+\\\\ \\\\ce{O2 ^} &+\\\\ \\\\ce{I-} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\ce{2H2O2} & &\\\\ce{-> 2H2O} &+\\\\ \\\\ce{O2 ^} & &\\\\Delta_\\\\mathrm{r}H^\\\\circ = -196\\\\text{ kJ/mol} \\\\end{array} The reaction is exothermic; the foam produced is hot. A glowing splint can be used to show that the gas produced is oxygen. The rate of foam formation measured in volume per time unit has a positive correlation with the peroxide concentration (v/V%), which means that the more reactants (peroxide concentration) the faster the rate of foam formation.

Alaska is one of the few states that does not have a statewide sales tax or income tax, instead relying heavily on revenue from leasing land for energy development and taxing profits on extracted resources such as oil and gas. Conoco Phillips Alaska asked the Alaska legislature in 2010 to reconsider some provisions of the law known as the Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share, which sets a baseline tax of 25% on all revenue from Alaskan oil, which can increase to up to 75% as the price of a barrel of oil increases.Demer, Lisa. \\"Legislature hears conflicting statements about oil taxes .\\" Anchorage Daily News.

Initially, it was primarily intended a substitution for conventional, face-to-face therapy in which a client or patient is required to visit a psychotherapists office. Increasingly, however, academics are studying the use of electronic media in treatment to explore the possibility of providing novel and potentially more effective therapies. After reviewing thirteen relevant studies, the authors of a meta-analytic review of psychotherapy mediated by remote communications technology concluded that: > Remote therapy has the potential to overcome some of the barriers to > conventional psychological therapy services.

Examples include: *The US Army has initiated a program in which soldiers in combat participate in video-based relationship counseling with their partners at home. *AbleTo uses remote therapy to extend the reach of evidence-based practice and introduce innovative new practices, e.g., the team-based applications of cognitive behavioral therapy utilizing a licensed therapist and behavioral coach. *Mayo Clinic, provides remote cognitive rehabilitation sessions to patients who have had an acquired brain injury.

Here Comes U.N.T.A.G! (Kwagga Strikes Back in Germany) is a South African comedy film and Leon Schuster's big screen debut about a rugged farmer named Kwagga 'The Lion-Killer' Robertse having to deal with a corrupt United Nations peacekeeper.  Plot  Kwagga Robertse owns a farm shop in the fictional Southern African country of Nambabwe and usually cons foreign tourists by pretending to kill a lion, thus earning him the nickname 'Urumbo' (Lion Killer) from the country's natives. Kwagga is upset when the United Nations sends a platoon of incompetent soldiers with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (U.N.T.A.G.), to monitor the peace process, and ensure free and fair elections after the Nambabwean War for Independence. The U.N.T.A.G's American leader, Major Bradick D. Mackay and his second-in- command, Captain Zapman are offered a valuable diamond, and they must pay 200,000 USD to Duan Robertse, Kwagga's competitive brother trying to buy a farm left to them by their dead father. Mackay decides to steal the natives' cattle and sell it to rogue guerrilla fighters across the northern border. Kwagga's new friend, Inga Olefse, a lieutenant-doctor for U.N.T.A.G., who is unaware of Mackay's deceit, is kidnapped by the guerrillas but Kwagga rescues her and threatens his brother to not buy their father's farm or he will turn him in to the police. Kwagga, who has fallen in love with Inga, then decides to exact revenge of Mackay by ruining his platoon on the day it is to be inspected by the U.N. commander in charge of operations in Nambabwe. He does this by tricking each incompetent soldier, a Springbuck-obsessed Hollander, Hendrick van den Ploes by faking his killing of a Springbuck and then covering him in animal blood so animals chase him into the base. He also disguises himself as a high-ranking Indian officer, ordering an automobile-challenged Bangladeshi Sergeant, Rashid to park and hide a tank, because he claims it is threatening to the U.N.'s peace efforts. He then again disguises himself, and sells fake rhino horn to a horn-obsessed Japanese soldier. Mackay's chances of passing the inspection comes when he ignores an agreement made to his sidekick Zapman, who in turn blows up his office to try steal the diamond they had purchased with the stolen cattle. The U.N.T.A.G. platoon is disbanded, with Kwagga and Inga expressing their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Mackay and Zapman wonder the Nambabwe desert with the diamond, only to find it is a forgery. As they argue about how angry they are, Kwagga accidentally lets off a cannon he keeps to chase away baboons, which in turn blast Mackay and Zapman to smithereens.

Prabhu Lal Soni (also known as Prabhu Lal Verma) was not only a court photographer, but also a hand-colorist who painted the black-and-white photographs that he produced. The skills of hand-coloring photographs were passed down to Rajesh through the intermediary of his father Lalit. Rajesh Soni’s talents for sketching and drawing were noticed at an early age and fostered by his father. As a young boy, Rajesh sketched from life the historic havelis and architecture of Udaipur’s old city, sometimes looking over the shoulders of art students who gathered to sketch on the ghats, and also eagerly teaching himself English from visiting tourists. In 2007 Rajesh met the American photographer Waswo X. Waswo, who encouraged him to work on reviving the tradition of hand-colored photography. Working on Waswo’s digital prints, Soni blended his grandfather’s traditional craft with the new technologies of photographic printing.

It was built in 1882 by Potts, Pickup & Dixon for the Textile Mill Co. Ltd, and closed in 1927. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the late 1940s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964 and used for cotton waste sorting. Half of the building was destroyed by fire on 11 July 1950, but the remaining section continued to be used for cotton waste sorting by W. H. Holt and Son until 1988. Lancashire England  Location  Oldham is a large town in North of England Greater Manchester, England. It lies amongst the Pennines on elevated ground between the rivers Irk and Medlock, south-southeast of Rochdale, and northeast of the city of Manchester. Oldham is surrounded by several smaller settlements which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham; Chadderton and Hollinwood are such settlements. Chadderton and Hollinwood are served by the Rochdale Canal and the Hollinwood Branch Canal. A rail service was provided by the Oldham Loop Line that was built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.  History  Oldham rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming \\"one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England\\", spinning Oldham counts, the coarser counts of cotton. Oldham's soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing, and so for decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that Oldham changed from being a cottage industry township producing woollen garments via domestic manual labour, to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories. The first mill, Lees Hall, was built by William Clegg in about 1778. Within a year, 11 other mills had been constructed, but by 1818 there were only 19 of these privately owned mills. It was in the second half of the 19th century that Oldham became the world centre for spinning cotton yarn.. This was due in a large part to the formation of limited liability companies known as Oldham Limiteds. In 1851, over 30% of Oldham's population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain. At its zenith, it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world.. Textile Mill was one of a cluster of mills built in Chadderton in 1882, it was designed by Potts, Pickup & Dixon. By 1871 the town of Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By 1911 there were 16.4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143.5 million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were over 360 mills, operating night and day; The industry peaked in 1912, when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914–1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. Textile Mill was closed in 1927. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Textile Mill, Chadderton bought by the LCC, after World War II, and used it for storage of baled waste for export, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950, when it was partly burnt out. Courtaulds sold it in 1966. The use for cotton waste continued. In 1996 it was reduced to 2 storeys.

History In 1799 the government purchased the collection of the Scottish surgeon John Hunter which they presented to the College. This formed the basis of the Hunterian Collection, which has since been supplemented by others including an Odontological Collection (curated by A E W Miles until the early 1990s) and the natural history collections of Richard Owen. The first museum building was considered inadequate in terms of space, and was closed in April 1834 to allow for an expansion project which added additional East and West galleries, completed in February 1837. A third room was added in 1852, and two further galleries were added between 1888 and 1892. In May 1941 the College building was badly damaged by bombs, with Rooms IV and V of the museum being completely destroyed along with their contents. After a slow process of entirely new construction in which some of the original design features were maintained, the Hunterian Museum reopened in a reduced form in 1963.

Built in the Sengoku period by Sassa Narimasa, the ruins are now a Fukui Prefectural Historic Site.  History  Komaru Castle was established in 1575 Sassa Narimasa, one of Oda Nobunaga's generals. Along Maeda Toshiie and Fuwa Mitsuharu, he was charged with keeping the peace and suppressing the Ikkō-ikki in Echizen Province. Komaru Castle was located on a small hill at the southern edge of the Fukui Plain. The inner bailey had stone ramparts and is thought to have had a donjon. A second and third bailey protected the inner citadel, and the whole was surrounded by moats and marsh. However, in 1581 Sassa Narimasa was awarded additional territories, and relocated to Etchū Province (current Toyama Prefecture), after leaving the unfinished Komaru Castle abandoned. During excavations in 1932, the earthen foundations, part of the gate to the honmaru, the remains of the dry moat, a tower foundation, and some fragments of roof tiles were found. The roof tiles were of especial interest to historians, as an account was written on its reverse side about Maeda Toshiie's suppression of the Ikkō-ikki in Echizen by mass executions of followers.

The Canadian Durant firm was acquired by a group of Canadian investors and renamed Dominion Motors Limited. The firm continued building Durant and Frontenac cars. The first Frontenac, for 1931, was model 6-18, a 109-inch- wheelbase car based on the Durant 619. After Durant Motors went under in 1932, Dominion Motors switched to De Vaux for a source of car designs. The 1932 Frontenac range consisted of two sixes, 6-70 (109-inch wheelbase), an update of the 1931 6-18, and the 6-85 (114-inch wheelbase) based on the De Vaux 6-80. And just as Durant got into trouble, so did De Vaux. The firm was taken over by its major creditor, Continental Motors, in late 1932. Continental decided to continue car production under the Continental name and Dominion Motors decided to base their cars on Continental vehicles. Just as the 1933 Continental line consisted of three models, so did Frontenac. The last Frontenac models were the C-400, a -inch-wheelbase four-cylinder car based on the Continental Beacon and the C-600, based on the 107-inch-wheelbase, six- cylinder Continental Flyer.

Plot summary Maxie \\"Slapsie\\" Rosenbloom plays a dim-witted but lovable ex-boxer and character actor who happens to run a nightclub. The Harvard Lampoon, an undergraduate humor publication, honors the night club owner with a very \\"special award\\". Maxie's friends, Francie Callahan, the cashier and general manager of the club, and Hypo McGonigle, sportswriter, suspect Slapsie is about to be made a fool by the publication. The chief editor of the Harvard Lampoon, Harrison Carey, soon enough presents an award for \\"Supreme Pediculousness\\", and the friends worst fears are realized. Maxie accepts the award with pride, not realizing he has been awarded for being infested with lice. The next morning, Maxie's humiliation is reported by all the newspapers, but instead of becoming angry and vengeful, Maxie decides to enroll at the prestigious institute of learning and become an educated man. At Harvard university, Maxie then meets professor Nickajack Alvin, the head of the Antediluvian Department. Alvin instantly is convinced that Maxie is indeed the \\"missing link,\\" which makes him conduct a series of tests to prove that the club owner is a throwback to the caveman. Alvin is very satisfied with the results, and offers Maxie $1,500 a year plus room and board in exchange for further testing of his mental abilities. Maxie is very flattered, and accepts the offer. Not long after Maxie's enrollment, Hypo arrives at Harvard on a one-year newspaper scholarship. In the meantime, Maxie has won the respect and admiration of the undergraduates as well as the heart of young student Zella Phipps, a broad-shouldered amazon. When Alvin announces that his tests have determined that Maxie is the country's number one moron, Maxie is ordained as the arbiter of taste for the other twenty- three million morons in the country. Realizing that Maxie's endorsement is worth millions, business offers pour in from manufacturers anxious to have him bless their products, and Maxie signs a contract with one shrewd promoter for one thousand dollars a week. Now, Maxie is indeed on a winning streak. Full of entrepreneurial spirit, Maxie decides to open a College Inn near the Harvard campus and sends for Francie to help him. However, Francie is quite angry with Maxie for signing a contract without her approving it beforehand. Francie shuts him out from his business arrangement and then forms a corporation known as Twenty Million Jerks, Inc. In due time Alvin is finished with the testing of Maxie, and he offers Maxie an \\"extraordinary diploma.\\" Maxie, is again honored by the award, but he also realizes that the amorous Zella, in which he has no interest in marrying, would never wed an uneducated man. So Maxie declines the professor's offer, and in doing so puts an end to Zella's interest in being married to him. Later, at the grand opening of the new College Inn, Maxie announces that he is giving his financial support to a School for Morons at Harvard university. He then congratulates Francie and Hypo on their engagement. The film is also known as Here I Come in the United Kingdom.

The castle fell into ruins during the Sengoku period and the site was completely built over in the modern era, so nothing remains today.  History  By its name, the original Echizen-Fuchū Castle is thought to have been built on the \\"Fuchū\\", or site of the Nara period provincial capital of Echizen Province. This fortified residence was subsequently used by the Shugo, or military governors of the province in the Heian through Kamakura period. However, with the rise of the Asakura clan to power, the center of government for Echizen Province shifted to Ichijōdani, and the Asakura appointed a local magistrate who resided at Fuchū. During the Sengoku period, Oda Nobunaga invaded and conquered the province and crushed the Ikkō-ikki movement. Afterwards, Echizen was divided between three of his generals: Fuwa Mitsuharu, Sassa Narimasa, and Maeda Toshiie, with Maeda Toshiie rebuilding Echizen-Fuchū Castle in 1575. Maeda Toshiie used the nearby Hino River to create a double system of moats around the castle, with a width of 180 meters north-south and 100 meters east-west. Maeda Toshiie was subsequently transferred to Noto Province, but Echizen-Fuchū was retained by his son, Maeda Toshinaga as the center of a 100,000 koku domain until he was transferred to Kaga Province after the Battle of Shizugatake and the castle was awarded to Niwa Nagahide instead. Following the Battle of Sekigahara, all of Echizen Province was awarded to Tokugawa Ieyasu's second son, Yūki Hideyasu as Fukui Domain. Yūki Hideyasu established his seat at Fukui Castle and installed his retainer, Honda Tomimasa as castellan of Echizen-Fuchū. Honda renovated the castle, building a two-story donjon, a residence, tea house, and other structures. After the Meiji Restoration, the moat was filled in, the castle site became the site of an elementary school. Subsequently, the castle site was completely destroyed when the Takefu city office was constructed.

Life and work  After receiving his Abitur from the Ravensberger Gymnasium in Herford in 1975, he studied at the University of Göttingen where he obtained his Diplom in 1981 and his doctoral degree under Tammo tom Dieck in 1984. His thesis was entitled Eine allgemeine Beschreibung für Faserungen auf projektiven Klassengruppen und Whiteheadgruppen. From 1982 on he was research assistant and from 1985 on he was assistant in Göttingen. In 1989 Lück received his Habilitation. From 1990-91, he was Associate Professor at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. From 1991 until 1996, he was professor at the University of Mainz, and from 1996 until 2010 he taught at the University of Münster. Since 2010 he has been a professor at the University of Bonn. In 2003, he was awarded the Max Planck Research Award and in 2008 the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize. Lück has made significant contributions in topology; he and his coauthors resolved many cases of the Farrell-Jones conjecture and the Borel conjecture. He has also contributed to the development of the theory of L2-invariants (such as L2-Betti numbers and L2-cohomology) of manifolds, which were originally introduced by Michael Atiyah and are defined by means of operator algebras. These invariants have applications in group theory and geometry. In 2009 and 2010 Lück was president of the German Mathematical Society, whose vice president he had been since 2006.

Ross conducting Wallace Michael Ross (19 September 1920 - 20 January 2010) was the founder of the Derby Bach Choir. He was also the Master of Music at Derby Cathedral, assistant organist at several great English Cathedrals and a teacher of languages and music at several schools, including Sturgess School in Derby. He also founded the Derby Cathedral Brass Ensemble and the Derby Sinfonia. Life and achievements Wallace Ross was born in Yeovil. His father was a businessman with a pharmaceutical firm in Cambridge. He attended King’s College Choir School, not as a chorister but as an ordinary pupil. After this, Wallace attended Rugby School and he followed Edward Heath at Balliol College, Oxford as Organ Scholar. World War II interrupted his studies and Wallace served as a gunner in Dover and Northern Ireland becoming a sergeant and an instructor in aircraft recognition. It is believed that at this time he met his \\"sweetheart\\", never to find a life together with her. After the war he continued at Balliol but did not achieve the doctorate he sought. After Balliol, Wallace articled at Chichester Cathedral to Horace Hawkins, also known as Daddy Hawkins, where Wallace’s eccentricities were hinted at by Hawkins’ nickname for Wallace, Buffalo Bill. Apparently Wallace was not daunted when he had been locked out of the organ loft. He climbed up in an unregulated way to the loft “up and over”. Posts of assistant organist were to follow, at Beverley Minster, Leicester Cathedral and Gloucester Cathedral. During these appointments Wallace was pursuing his career as teacher of music, classics, PT and rugby at various schools. At Leicester, he was music master at Alderman Newton's School. His talent for performing and teaching music was established. Joining the Railway Working man’s club, Wallace extended his expertise playing with the band on the bass tuba. His hobbies of a glass of ale, and railway mania were fulfilled. In 1958, Wallace was appointed as organist at Derby Cathedral. Working as a teacher of languages, history and music at Sturgess School he rapidly became well loved in the city. He coached and refereed Rugby Football over the years in Derby. Wallace’s work as organist and master of music at the Cathedral took off at the enthronement of Bishop Allen in 1959. He wanted a fanfare to greet the Bishop; but he knew of no local musicians that might undertake the task. He got on to his network to get up a team of brass players from ex pupils and acquaintances. Bishop Allen was greeted by what became the Derby Cathedral Brass Ensemble. In 1969, Wallace founded the Derby Bach choir. This body made joyous sounds and improved the singing skills of many in Derby. Soloists were national singers from London. The choir’s repertoire included challenging works of many modern composers. Ross driving a traction engine Wallace frequently displayed eccentricities some of which derived from his love of railway steam engines. Many pupils and colleagues witnessed him walking along and pretending to be an engine (and its driver). Finding it hard to adapt to a changing world, he liked to do things in his own way. This caused problems and some were not very tolerant. Wallace found himself out of a job or two during his career. The last occasion of this was at the Cathedral when a new Provost felt that a new broom was required. The Parish of Kegworth gained from this as Wallace became organist there. Wallace later spoke warmly of his time there and of the Rector. Although he had not married and had no family Wallace formed, in later life, a strong and lasting family bond with the Cartwright family.Parts of the above were adapted from the address given by Fr Michael Brinkworth, Canon Emeritus of Derby, at St John's Church, Derby on the occasion of Wallace Ross' funeral Feb 2010, gleaned from documents in the possession of the Garners.

It is an irregular four-wing complex. With its imposing silhouette the former Schwarzburg residence dominates today's district town of Sondershausen in the Kyffhäuserkreis district. the west wing of the Palace Panoramic view of the palace  History  Sondershausen Palace, view from the marketplace with the guardhouse,called \\"Alte Wache\\" the west wing Blue Hall Detail of the Giant's Hall There is proof that some of the oldest building fabrice of the castle dating from the end of the 13th century can be attributed to the Counts of Hohnstein. The remaining tower was integrated under Count Günther XL of Schwarzburg when the Renaissance palace, consisting of the south, east and old north wings, was built between the 1530s and the 1550s. Under Prince Christian William I of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, who reigned between 1666 and 1720, a busy building activity started in the 1680s. The three Renaissance wings of the palace were altered and enlarged in the Baroque style. During the reign of Prince Christian Günther III of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, the new west and north rococo wings were started in 1764 under management of the Quedlinburg architect Johann Heinrich Breit and the former architect from Brunswick, Martin Peltier. At that time the palace received its final architectural layout of an irregular four-wing complex. When Prince Günther Friedrich Carl II, who reigned from 1835 to 1880, engaged Carl Scheppig, a pupil of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, in 1836, his aim was to give most parts of the entire palace complex a completely new appearance. Financial constraints, however, limited this project to redesigning the eastern place area towards the market (palace terrace, guard house and stairs between 1837 and 1839), to rebuilding the rococo wings in the neo-classical style (1846–1851) and to erecting the new stables (1847–1849). As the last building measure a two-storey gallery, connecting the tower and the east and south wings, was erected in 1914 to 1915.  Historical Rooms   The Blue Hall  Prince Christian Günther gave the hall in order in 1760. The hall in the Rococo style extends over the two upper storeys and has galleries on both long sides. The dominant colors are blue and white; they reflect the state colors of Schwarzburg- Sondershausen. In this hall there are traces of traditional Baroque tectonics as well as transitional elements from Baroque to Neoclassicism and finally Rococo ornaments typical of the time. The large oval ceiling painting depicts the Callisto myth.  The Giants' Hall  The construction of the hall going back to Count (later Prince) Christian Wilhelm of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen between 1680 and 1700. It is decorated in the style of the high Baroque with 22 ceiling paintings about scenes from Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\" and 16 larger- than-life figures in the round made of stucco and represents Greek gods. The fact that this hall was originally designed during the Renaissance explains the unusual proportions (26.6 x 13.2 metres) and the relatively low ceiling of 4.8 metres.  The Stone Room  This room has preserved original decorations from the 1770s. The name is derived from the wall covering consisting of small cut, polished and glazed tiles of plaster and limestone. In this form, the room is unique and it is known for its uniqueness as the \\"Amber Room\\" of Sondershausen.  Palace today  Since 1994, the former residence of the princes of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen is the property of the Palace, Castle and Gardens Trust of Thuringia. Today it houses the Palace Museum of Sondershausen and the district school of music, called Carl- Schroeder-Konservatorium.

The NHN plane is a theoretical reference plane. It is derived by deducting normal heights from the normal plumb line. The difference between the resulting quasi-geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the height anomaly or quasi-geoid height.  Change-over from NN to NHN  Since 1 January 2000 the whole of Germany has changed its height system over to normal heights based on the datum of the Amsterdam Ordnance Datum, known as the German Mean Height Reference System, DHHN92. At the same time the new NHN is the basis of the United European Levelling Net (UELN), formerly known as the ' or , which standardises the height systems of the European countries. Heights in this system are given in metres above NHN or m (NHN). The NHN was introduced because for heights above the actual gravitational field of the earth was not taken into account. As a result, there were changes in both the old West German normal orthometric heights (new methods of calculation) and the normal heights of East Germany (with respect to the Amsterdam Datum). The elevations differed — depending on location — by 0.06 to 0.16 metres. As a result of new measurements as part of the changeover, however, variations of 0.59 metres () have surfaced. Older relief maps often show heights above the old reference planes.

He was also the first marshal of his class and president of his freshman class. In 1909, he enrolled at Harvard Law School, and in 1910, he became the chief lineman coach at Harvard while in his second year as a law student. In early October 1910, he became ill with typhoid fever. He died at Des Brisay Hospital in December 1910 at age 24 after his third relapse. Burr's funeral was held at the Appleton Chapel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and all recitations at Harvard were suspended for one hour on the day of his funeral. In 1914, Burr's friends established the Francis H. Burr Award in his honor. The award was given each year to a senior, selected by the Dean of Harvard College and the Chairman of the Athletic Committee, who \\"combines as nearly as possible Burr's remarkable qualities of character, leadership, scholarship, and athletic ability.\\" Past recipients of the Francis H. Burr Award include Henry Dunker (1924), J.P. Chase (1927), F. J. Mardulier (1929), Vernon Munroe Jr. (1930), Barry Wood (1931), Richard Ames (1933), Chester Litman (1934), Richard H.

Sala’s present goals are to help protect critical marine ecosystems worldwide, and to develop new business models for marine conservation. He also produces documentary films and other media to raise awareness about the importance of a healthy environment, and to inspire country leaders to protect more of the natural world.  Early Life and Education  Sala grew up near the Costa Brava in Catalonia, where he developed a lifelong passion for the ocean. He obtained his Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Barcelona in 1991 and a Ph.D. in ecology from the University of Aix-Marseille, France in 1996. Sala then moved to the United States to become a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  Career  Sala was a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California (2000–2007) and a researcher at Spain's National Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) (2007–2008). At Scripps, Sala helped create the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation, an innovative multidisciplinary program to train future leaders in marine conservation. In 2006, Enric moved back to Spain to hold the first position on marine conservation ecology at the Spanish National Council for Scientific Research (CSIC). One day, Sala was hit with a stark realization: “What I was doing was simply writing the obituary of the ocean,\\" he says. \\"I was describing how ocean life was dying with more and more precision, but not offering a cure. I felt like the doctor who was telling the patient how she was going to die, but not offering a solution.\\" Following this realization, Sala read a National Geographic Magazine article about Mike Fay, a National Geographic Explorer who trekked across central Africa and convinced the president of Gabon to create 13 national parks. Sala was inspired—this sort of project was exactly what he wanted to do in the ocean. Shortly thereafter, Sala decided to approach National Geographic with a plan. “I went to National Geographic and proposed a project combining exploration, research, and media to inspire governments to make marine reserves–national parks in the sea.\\" In 2008 Sala was named a National Geographic fellow and began to develop the Pristine Seas initiative. In 2011, he and James Cameron were both named National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence.  Pristine Seas  Since 2008, Sala has led National Geographic Pristine Seas. Pristine Seas is a project to explore, document and protect the last wild places in the ocean. Using a combination of expeditions, science, media and policy analysis, the Pristine Seas team has helped to inspire the protection of 22 marine protected areas covering more than 5.7 million square kilometers of ocean. Pristine Seas is a small team of less than thirty people based in Washington, DC and other sites around the world. The team has conducted 31 expeditions, published more than 90 scientific papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and produced 28 documentary films.  Research  Sala's research not only shows the human impacts in the ocean, but it also shows how marine ecosystems can recover, and develops practical solutions to improve the health of our oceans. His scientific publications are widely recognized and used for conservation efforts. Pristine Seas’ research results include the discovery of an inverted biomass pyramid in pristine coral reefs, new species of fish and invertebrates, previously unknown populations of deep-sea animals, the deepest plant ever found in the ocean, descriptions of some of the healthiest ocean ecosystems, and a description of the ecological and economic benefits of no- take marine reserves. In 2018, Sala published a study revealing that without government subsidies, more than half of fishing activity on the high seas would be unprofitable.

The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 and flows almost directly west from a few miles due north of the hamlet of Willowemoc, through Livingston Manor to Roscoe, where it joins the Beaver Kill at the Junction Pool, noted for trout fishing. It has many tributaries that flow into it from both the north and south. Going from east to west, from the source to the outlet at the Beaver Kill, these are: Butternut Brook and Fir Brook; Fall Brook (at Willowemoc), Hunter Brook (from Hunter Lake), Mongaup Creek (at Debruce), Little Beaver Kill and Cattail Brook (at Livingston Manor), Bascom Brook, and Hazel Brook and Stewart Brook, just east of Roscoe. Fishing Large sections of the Willowemoc are open to public fishing. It is an especially popular and picturesque fly fishing stream. The Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum is on the Willowemoc, not far from Livingston Manor, on old Route 17. Brown trout are stocked from the Catskill Mountain Fish Hatchery located a few miles north of Debruce. Brook trout thrive in the upper reaches of the stream. Rainbow trout do not fare as well. The lower part of the Creek, between Livingston Manor and Roscoe, is paralleled by New York State Route 17, from which exceptional views of the Catskill Mountains can be seen. This part of the Willowemoc becomes 40 to 100 feet wide, with many pools three to five feet deep. The opening day for trout fishing is April 1. Designations The creek has been spelled many ways over the years: Weelewaughmack, Weelewaughwemack, Willikwernock, Willerwhemack, Willowwemoc, Williwemock, and so on.

The Council asked the Secretary-General to report back again before 31 May 1992, to follow the implementation of the resolution.

In the wild, the species can only be found on the islands of Crete and Karpathos (subsp. clusii), and Rhodes (subsp. rhodia). It has pinkish-purple stem up to 30 cm long and glaucous dissected leaves. P. clusii blooms in mid-spring.Peonies: The Imperial Flower by Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall  Description  Paeonia clusii is a perennial, herbaceous plant of 25–50 cm high. Both diploid (2n=10) and tetraploid (2n=20) specimens have been found.  Root, stems and leaves  The main roots are slightly tuberous, up to 2½ cm wide, with thinner carrot-shaped side roots. The stems are mostly tinged purple, with several (up to nine) scales at their base. Leaves are split into three sets of leaflets, themselves further divided into twenty three to forty eight, 2½–4½ cm wide, ovate to lanceolate (subspecies rhodia) or to ninety five lanceolate to linear, ½–3¼ cm wide, segments (in the typical subspecies). The leaf is mostly hairless, but sometimes the lower surface carries a few hairs.  Flower, fruit and seed  The usual white-flowered variantThe flowers are set individually at the tip of the stems, and are subtended by one or two bracts that look like small segmented leaves. There are three or four rounded sepals, green but purple around the margin, and with a rounded tip. Within are seven white or pink petals of 4–5 cm long and 2½–4 cm wide. The many stamens consist of purple filaments topped by yellow anthers. The disk that encircle the carpels is ½–1 mm high and covered in soft hair. Two to four (or rarely only one) red carpels are covered in soft, white, 2–2½ mm long hairs and topped by an almost seated flattened, recurving, red stigma 1½–2 mm wide. Each carpel later develops into an ellipsoid fruit called a follicle, that is 3½–4 cm long and about 1½ cm wide, and which is curved down when ripe, and contains oval black seeds of 8 mm long and 5 mm in diameter.  Differences between the subspecies  Subspecies rhodia is characterised by twenty three to forty eight, ovate to lanceolate leaf segments, each between 2½ and 4½ cm wide. Subspecies clusii has between twenty three and ninety five leaf segments in the lower leaves. The segments are lanceolate to linear, each usually no more than 2⅔ cm wide, but rare exceptions to 3¼ cm.  Taxonomy  In 1824, Joseph Sabine describes Paeonia cretica based on a specimen from the University of Oxford Botanic Garden, which later turned out to be synonymous to Paeonia arietina (named in 1818), and this plant probably originated from mainland Turkey, not from Crete. Another specimen, now from Crete, was described as P. cretica in 1828 by Tausch, but at that moment the name was no longer available, and hence invalid. Stern proposed P. clusii to replace Tausch's name. Stearn, in 1941, distinguished the population on Rhodes as a separate species and named it P. rhodia. Tzanoudakis however, points out it only differs in the number and shape of the leaf segments, and thus regards it as a subspecies of P. clusii. cited on  Etymology  Paeonia clusii was named in honor of the Dutch botanist Carolus Clusius, who was the first to write about a white flowered peony from Crete, already in 1601.  Ecology  A group of P. clusii growing on CreteThe typical subspecies grows in maquis on limestone between 200–1900 m altitude. Subspecies rhodia occurs as undergrowth of pines at an elevation of 350–850 m.  Cultivation  Rhodes' peony likes well-drained, loamy soil or compost. It's hardy in the UK, but because it starts growing in late winter the leaves may be damaged by frosts. As can be expected from a plant from the Mediterranean, they suffer from wet soil.

This is an important property because erythrocytes must change their shape extensively under the influence of mechanical forces in fluid flow or while passing through microcirculation. The extent and geometry of this shape change can be affected by the mechanical properties of the erythrocytes, the magnitude of the applied forces, and the orientation of erythrocytes with the applied forces. Deformability is an intrinsic cellular property of erythrocytes determined by geometric and material properties of the cell membrane, although as with many measurable properties the ambient conditions may also be relevant factors in any given measurement. No other cells of mammalian organisms have deformability comparable with erythrocytes; furthermore, non-mammalian erythrocytes are not deformable to an extent comparable with mammalian erythrocytes. In human RBC there are structural support that aids resilience in RBC which include the cytoskeleton- actin and spectrin that are held together by ankyrin. The phenomenon Shape change of erythrocytes under applied forces (i.e., shear forces in blood flow) is reversible and the biconcave-discoid shape, which is normal for most mammals, is maintained after the removal of the deforming forces. In other words, erythrocytes behave like elastic bodies, while they also resist to shape change under deforming forces. This viscoelastic behavior of erythrocytes is determined by the following three properties: 1) Geometry of erythrocytes; the biconcave-discoid shape provides an extra surface area for the cell, enabling shape change without increasing surface area. This type of shape change requires significantly smaller forces than those required for shape change with surface area expansion. 2) Cytoplasmic viscosity; reflecting the cytoplasmic hemoglobin concentration of erythrocytes. 3) Visco-elastic properties of erythrocyte membrane, mainly determined by the special membrane skeletal network of erythrocytes. Physiological significance Erythrocyte deformability is an important determinant of blood viscosity, hence blood flow resistance in the vascular system. It affects blood flow in large blood vessels, due to the increased frictional resistance between fluid laminae under laminar flow conditions. It also affects the microcirculatory blood flow significantly, where erythrocytes are forced to pass through blood vessels with diameters smaller than their size. Clinical significance Erythrocyte deformability is altered under various pathophysiological conditions. Sickle- cell disease is characterized by extensive impairment in erythrocyte deformability, being dependent on the oxygen partial pressure. Erythrocyte deformability has also been demonstrated to be impaired in diabetes, peripheral vascular diseases, sepsis and a variety of other diseases. The property offers broad utility in disease diagnosis (also see Measurement, below). Stored packed red blood cells (sometimes denoted \\"pRBC\\" or \\"StRBC\\") also experience changes in membrane properties like deformability during storage and related processing, as part of a broader phenomenon known as \\"storage lesion.\\" While the clinical implications are still being explored, deformability can be indicative of quality or preservation thereof for stored RBC product available for blood transfusion.Decreased Erythrocyte Deformability After Transfusion and the Effects of Erythrocyte Storage Duration, Anesth Analg, published ahead of print February 28, 2013Journal of Blood Transfusion, Volume 2012, Article ID 102809Ann Ist Super Sanita 2007; 43(2):176-85.

Artificial microvascular network: a new tool for measuring rheologic properties of stored red blood cells. Burns JM, Yang X, Forouzan O, Sosa JM, Shevkoplyas SS. Measurement Erythocyte deformability is a measurable property, and various means for its measurement have been explored - with each having results and significance being highly particularized to the given approach employed. Accordingly, the term is somewhat loose in the sense that a given cell or sample of cells may be deemed significantly more \\"deformable\\" by one means/metric relative to another means/metric. Thus for meaningful \\"apples-to-apples\\" comparisons involving cell deformability, it is important to utilize the same qualitative approach. Ektacytometry based on laser diffraction analysis is a commonly preferred (and a fairly direct) method for measuring deformability. Another direct metric is optical tweezers, which targets individual cells. Deformability can in effect be measured indirectly, such as by how much pressure and/or time it takes cells pass through pores of a filter (i.e., filterability or filtration)Advances in Hemodynamics and Hemorheology, Volume 1, edited by T.V.

Moreover, some tests may track how deformability itself changes as conditions change and/or as deformation is repeated. Related erythrocyte properties Erythrocytes/RBC may also be tested for other (related) membrane properties, including erythrocyte fragility (osmotic or mechanical) and cell morphology. Morphology can be measured by indexes which characterize shape changes of differences among cells. Fragility testing involves subjecting a sample of cells to osmotic and/or mechanical stress(es), then ascertaining how much hemolysis results thereafter, and then characterizing susceptibility to or propensity for stress-induced hemolysis with an index or profile (which can be useful to assess cells' ability to withstand sustained or repeated stresses). Other related red blood cell properties can include adhesion and aggregation, which along with deformability are often classed as RBC \\"flow properties.\\" References Category:Hematology ","title":"Erythrocyte deformability"},{"id":"26197413","text":"Paeonia cambessedesii is a perennial herbaceous species of peony of about 45 cm high. It has pink flowers. The stems, major veins and undersides of the leaves remain purple red, while the upper surface of the leaves turns into a metallic bluish green when fully grown and its lower leaves consist of no more than nine leaflets or segments. This endemic of the Balearic Islands is now limited to parts of northeastern and northwestern Majorca. In English it is sometimes called Balearic peony or Majorcan peony.  Description  Paeonia cambessedesii is a clump-forming, perennial, herbaceous peony, which dies down in the autumn, and overwinters with buds just under the surface of the soil, and may reach a height of 25–60 cm. The reddish purple stem carries several alternately arranged leaves. The lowest leaves consist of nine leathery, hairless leaflets which are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped with a pointy tip. The upper surface of the leafblade is bluish green with a metallic gloss, while the main veins are reddish purple, and the underside of the leafblade is purple. Each stem carries one cup-shaped flower of 6–12 cm with usually eight (5-10) pale to purplish pink petals, and is said to smell of roses. Within is a circle of numerous purple filaments topped by yellow anthers. The center of the flower consists of three to nine, initially purple carpels, each of which is connected through a thick style with a reddish stigma on top. The stigmas ripen before the stamens, a situation called protogyny. The three to eight (mostly four to six) carpels develop into dry dehiscent fruits (called follicles) of about 6 cm long, that open with a suture along their lengths, and contain initially carmine colored seeds that turn glossy black when fully ripe.  Growth cycle  leftIn February the stalks which have an intense garnet color emerge from the soil. This color is the result of a high concentration of anthocyanins, whose dark color absorbs sunlight and prevents freezing of these young and tender parts early in the year. In March the emerging stem unfolds and leaves and buds become clearly visible. A few weeks later flowering may start. First the stigmas are fertile for a few days, while the anthers remain closed to prevent self-pollination. by the time the ovaries have been fertilized, the anthers mature and pollen can be picked up by insects and carried to other flowers. In late August, the ripe fruits open and the shiny black seeds can be dispersed. Unfertilised seeds appear as red, soft granules with flat surfaces. The seedlings of this peony usually only appear after several winters. Young plants first appear in early spring and are protected against frost by their high anthocyanin content.  Differences with related species  P. cambessedesii differs from all other peonies as its lower leaves have (seven to) nine entire leaflets, never more or incised, all its parts are absolutely hairless, it has on average more carpels per flower than any other Eurasian herbaceous peony: (3-) 4-6 (-8), and it has nearly always reddish purple stems and undersides of the leaves throughout the season. It is most related to P. russoi, from Corsica and Sardinia, but that species is a tetraploid, and the upper surface of its leaves retain a purple hue even when fully developed.  Taxonomy  P. cambessedesii is a diploid (2n=10) species of hybrid origin, and is, like all other Eurasian herbaceous species, assigned to the section Paeonia. One of the parents of P. cambessedesii is P. lactiflora, the other parent is not fully certain but most likely P. mairei, but P. obovata may also have played a role in the genetic make-up of P. cambessedesii. The tetrapoid P. russoi is very likely of the same origin, and could be regarded its sister species.  Etymology  The species is named in honor of Jacques Cambessèdes, a French botanist who collected in the Balearic Islands.  Distribution and ecology  Paeonia cambessedesii is an endemic of the Balearic Islands, at one time present on Mallorca, Menorca and Cabrera, but now limited to the mountainous Northeast of Mallorca, such as in the Parc Natural de Llevant, and Northwest, such as the slopes of the Puig Major, where it grows on rocky limestone slopes or below limestone cliffs. It grows together with species like Aristolochia bianorum, Astragalus balearicus, Galium balearicum, Helichrysum italicum, Helleborus lividus, Hypericum balearicum, Pastinaca lucida, Rosmarinus officinalis, Rubia angustifolia, Scrophularia canina, Santolina chamaecyparissus, Smilax aspera, Teucrium asiaticum and T. marum. Like all peonies, the Balearic peony is very poisonous, and is avoided by grazers. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects.  Conservation  leftThe Balearic peony's territory has shrunk due to grazers such as feral goats, but also to picking the flowers and digging out plants for in the garden, and remaining sites may also be destroyed by urban development, such as for tourists.  Cultivation  The plant is now regarded as a collectors item for plantsmen's gardens. The plant is probably not very hardy and vulnerable to stagnant water, so may be expected to perform best in temperate climates when offered deep, well- draining, lime-rich soil, in a warm, sunny and well protected location. Many nurseries and seed companies sell the plant and the seeds nowadays. In cultivation the plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Germination It is suggested that seeds can be tricked into early germination by putting them in a closed container under a moist topsoil and storing them in a refrigerator for three or four months. In early spring the seeds can be sown outside and these usually germinate within a few weeks without problems. If the seeds do not germinate after the first cold treatment, it is advised to repeat it until successful. The small seedlings of Paeonia cambessedesii share the intense gamut of color with the shoots of their parents and are protected against frost this way. It may take four or five years before the plant is capable of producing its first flower. Other uses The root of the Balearic peony is said to have been used as a cure against epilepsy.

Stacked red blood cells flow across drying slideErythrocytes aggregate in a special way, forming rouleaux. Rouleaux are stacks of erythrocytes which form because of the unique discoid shape of the cells in vertebrate body. The flat surface of the discoid RBCs give them a large surface area to make contact and stick to each other; thus, forming a rouleau. Rouleaux formation takes place only in suspensions of RBC containing high-molecular, fibrilar proteins or polymers in the suspending medium (often Dextran-2000 in-vitro). The most important protein causing rouleaux formation in plasma is fibrinogen. RBC suspended in simple salt solutions do not form rouleaux. Mechanism Erythrocyte aggregation is a physiological phenomenon that takes places in normal blood under low-flow conditions or at stasis. The presence or increased concentrations of acute phase proteins, particularly fibrinogen, results in enhanced erythrocyte aggregation. Current experimental and theoretical evidence supports the mechanism related to the depletion of high-molecular weight molecules (e.g., fibrinogen) for rouleaux formation. This mechanism is also known as “chemiosmotic hypothesis” for aggregation. Erythrocyte aggregation is determined by both suspending phase (blood plasma) and cellular properties. Surface properties of erythrocytes, such as surface charge density strongly influence the extent and time course of aggregation. Effects Erythrocyte aggregation is the main determinant of blood viscosity at low shear rate. Rouleaux formation also determines Erythrocyte sedimentation rate which is a non-specific indicator of the presence of disease.Oxford Textbook of Medicine Influence of erythrocyte aggregation on in vivo blood flow is still a controversial issue. Enhanced aggregation affects venous hemodynamics. Erythrocyte aggregation also affects hemodynamic mechanisms in microcirculation and vascular control mechanisms. Causes Conditions which cause increased rouleaux formation include infections, inflammatory and connective tissue disorders, and cancers (most common in multiple myeloma). It also occurs in diabetes mellitus and is one of the causative factors for microvascular occlusion in diabetic retinopathy. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate closely reflects the extent of aggregation, therefore can be used as a measure of aggregation.

As the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, he was the top federal law enforcement official for the city of Chicago on behalf of the United States Department of Justice. As U.S. Attorney, Webb led Operation Greylord and successfully prosecuted 76 corrupt judges, police officers, court clerks, and lawyers. Early life Webb grew up in Bushnell, in west central Illinois. His father was a mail carrier, and his mother a dental assistant. Webb graduated from Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois. Webb attended Loyola University Chicago School of Law, receiving a J.D. in 1970. Government service United States attorney Webb is a former United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, serving from 1981 to 1985. From 1970 to 1976, he was an assistant U.S. attorney in the special prosecutions division of the U.S. attorney's office of the Northern District of Illinois. In 1990, Webb received international attention for his prosecution of retired Admiral John Poindexter in the Iran–Contra affair. The convictions were overturned on appeal. As a federal prosecutor in Illinois, he gained fame for his lead role in the Operation Greylord investigations into judicial corruption in Cook County, Illinois. Alongside Rudy Giuliani, current attorney to President Trump and former Mayor of New York City and United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Webb co-founded the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF). To date, OCDETF, which comprises 2,500 law enforcement agents from eleven federal agencies including the FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE, IRS, U.S. Marshals Service, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has conducted operations that have led to 44,000 drug- related convictions and the seizure of over $3 billion in cash and property assets. The Department of Justice considered appointing Webb as special prosecutor to examine President Bill Clinton's role in the Whitewater controversy but Webb declined due to an extensive case load. Iran-Contra Affair Webb previously served as Special Counsel in the Iran-Contra affair and successfully prosecuted Admiral John Poindexter, President Ronald Reagan's National Security Advisor, for lying to the United States Congress and obstructing their investigations. Admiral Poindexter's conviction was overturned on appeal in 1991. Webb famously deposed President Reagan during his investigation. Appointments as Special Prosecutor State of Illinois, Cook County In 2012, Webb was the special prosecutor in the case involving David Koschman, who died after being punched by the nephew of then- Chicago Mayor, Richard M. Daley. On August 23, 2019, Webb was appointed as the special prosecutor in the Jussie Smollett case. Private practice After leaving public service, his focus was on defense, especially of white-collar crime and allegations of corporate malfeasance. He was lead defense trial counsel for General Electric in a price-fixing case; represented Microsoft in antitrust litigation; and represented Philip Morris in its tobacco-related litigation. He the co-executive chairman of Winston & Strawn, an international law firm with nearly 1,000 attorneys in 16 offices in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, with gross revenue of $985 million in 2017. According to Chambers and Partners, Webb is one of the top seven trial lawyers in the United States. Webb represented Bill Gates and Microsoft in the United States v. Microsoft Corp, the New York Stock Exchange as chief counsel in a dispute involving $120 million in compensation paid to their former chairman and CEO Richard Grasso, General Electric in a price-fixing case, Philip Morris in its $300 billion tobacco-related litigation, Verizon in obtaining a $58 million verdict in a patent litigation matter with Vonage, Guggenheim Partners in litigation related to their $2.2 billion acquisition of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Beef Products Inc. in obtaining over $177 million, the largest ever settlement in the United States for a media defamation case, and other Fortune 100 corporations in litigation including BP, Boeing, JPMorgan Chase, Ernst & Young, Pfizer, and Deloitte. Webb has tried over 100 jury cases. Webb has represented numerous politicians in high-profile matters, including the Governor of Illinois George Ryan, Chicago Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., Chicago Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, and Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Webb represented the New York Stock Exchange as chief counsel in connection with an internal investigation over compensation to their former Chairman and CEO Richard Grasso and currently represents the NYSE in subsequent litigation. Following Webb's internal investigation, summarized in what is now known as the “Webb Report,” the New York Attorney General sued Grasso for the return of more than $120 million in compensation. He represented Beef Products Inc. in obtaining the largest ever settlement in the United States for a media defamation case. Disney reported that it paid Beef Products $177 million more than its insurance coverage to settle the case. Webb has also represented Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of General Electric, in his divorce and numerous personal matters, the city of Ferguson, Missouri to negotiate and litigate reforms with the United States Department of Justice following the shooting of Michael Brown, the children of Hyatt hotel heir Robert Pritzker in connection with allegations that their family trust funds were looted of about $1 billion, and billionaire Rishi Shah's Outcome Health in an internal investigation, following a Wall Street Journal exposé that alleged employees misled advertising clients. Alongside David Boies, lead counsel to Al Gore in Bush v. Gore that determined the 2000 United States Presidential Election, Webb represented $9 billion hedge fund Amaranth Advisors in the firm's dissolution. In January 2016, Webb was retained by the city of Chicago to conduct an independent review of their legal department, after it was alleged in a lawsuit that a city attorney hid evidence of a fatal police shooting. Webb also represented the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, William Kennedy Smith, in litigation alleging sexual harassment. Other corporations that Webb has represented include American Airlines, Alcoa, Charles Schwab, ConocoPhillips, Cisco Systems, Heinz, Bacardi, Cargill, State Farm, Motorola, and Express Scripts. George H. Ryan Webb served as lead defense counsel in the six-month jury trial of the former Governor of Illinois George H. Ryan on public corruption charges, including racketeering, mail fraud, and income tax fraud. His representation of the city of Chicago in an internal investigation was estimated to have cost the city over $3.5 million, and Webb's defense of Governor Ryan at trial was estimated to have cost the Governor over $10 million. Loyola University named its nationally recognized Center for Advocacy as the Dan K. Webb Center for Advocacy to honor his distinguished career. Donald Trump In March 2018, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, asked Webb to represent him personally and to lead his defense team in connection with Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation into the role of Trump's presidential campaign in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Webb declined to represent the President. He issued a statement to The Washington Post that the president's overture was the \\"highest honor\\" but that \\"business conflicts\\" prevented him from representing President Trump. Abbe Lowell, Webb's partner at law firm Winston & Strawn, represents the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump in the investigation, and Webb represents billionaire Dmitry Firtash, a business partner of Paul Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Webb represents Firtash alongside both Lanny Davis, defense counsel to President Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, and attorney Michael Chertoff, former United States Secretary of Homeland Security. Alongside Lanny Davis, defense attorney for President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, Webb also represents billionaire Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash should he be extradited to the United States to face charges of bribery. Firtash bid alongside business partner Paul Manafort, former chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, to acquire the New York Drake Hotel, and is an associate of former Ukrainian Presidents Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych. Recognition and awards Webb received his own profile in The New York Times, Need a Superlawyer?

According to The Wall Street Journal, Webb is one of the country's most highly regarded litigators, and according to the Los Angeles Times, Webb is one of the nation's leading trial attorneys. Webb was ranked the number one litigator in the United States by Euromoney's Guide to the World's Leading Litigation Lawyers, the top litigation expert in the United States by Guide to the World's Leading Lawyers, and Law360 named Winston & Strawn, led by Webb, as Trial Group Of The Year for 2018. Jenner & Block chairman Anton R. Valukas, bankruptcy examiner in the Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, called Webb \\"a stunningly good trial lawyer\\", and Brendan Sullivan, defense counsel in the Duke lacrosse case, remarked that Webb is \\"one of the most formidable courtroom lawyers in America today\\". During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, Nina Totenberg of NPR called Webb \\"the best prosecutor I have ever laid eyes on\\". Webb is admitted to the United States Supreme Court and allowed to practice law before the court. Webb is known to bill at nearly $1,400 an hour. Business Insider named Webb one of 11 Lawyers You Definitely Don't Want To See Across The Aisle, and The Legal 500 listed Webb as one of the top 10 trial lawyers in the United States. In addition to being named the number one litigator in the United States and the top litigation expert in the United States, Webb was also named the number one white-collar criminal defense attorney by Corporate Crime Reporter. Webb was named one of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America by The Best Lawyers in America. Lawdragon included Webb on its 2017 Hall of Fame and on Lawdragon 500: The Legends. Personal life Webb is married to Laura, they have five children, and live in Burr Ridge, a suburb of Chicago. None of their children has become a lawyer. In 2017, Webb participated in a televised mock trial on C-SPAN of William Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night, presented by The Shakespeare Theatre Company. Webb argued on behalf of main character Sebastian and the mock trial was judged by President Barack Obama's nominee to the United States Supreme Court, Judge Merrick Garland. Pamela Talkin, Marshal of the United States Supreme Court, served as marshal of the mock trial.

The vernacular name in Russia is Пион необыча́йный (Pion neobycháynyy) meaning \\"anomalous peony\\", in Kazakh it is called кәдімгі Таушымылдық (kädimgi Tawşımıldıq) \\"common peony\\", in Mongolia Ягаан цээнэ (Yagaan tseene) \\"pink peony\\", and in China 新疆芍药 (xin jiang shao yao), \\"Xinjiang peony\\". These plants are ½-1 m high, have a thick irregular taproot and thin side roots, and deeply incised leaves, with leaflets themselves divided in fine segments. It has almost always only one fully developed flower per stem, magenta-red or rarely pink or white. The species occurs in a zone between northern European Russia and northern Mongolia and south to the Tien Shan Mountains. P. anomala bears flowers in early summer. In garden cultivation, it requires full sun or half- shade and well drained soil. Double-flowered forms are cultivated.  Description  new growth with flowerbudfolliclesPaeonia anomala is a non- woody species of peony of ½–1 m high, with an irregular carrot-shaped taproot of over ½ m long and 2 cm thick, gradually getting thinner downwards and slender side roots. As all diploid peonies, it has 10 chromosomes (2n=10).  Leaves and Stems  The leaves have no sheath or stipules and are alternately arranged along the stem, are divided into a leaf stalk and leaf blade. The leaf blade is twice compounded or very deeply incised, first into three leaflets, themselves palmately compounded or deeply divided (this is called biternate), each leaflet being further divided into segments that themselves are lobed, resulting in seventy to one hundred segments of ¾-3¼ cm wide. At the end of the growing season the leaves may turn vivid red.  Inflorescence  One or very rarely two hermaphrodite flowers fully develop on each stem, while one or two flowerbuds are arrested in their development, and two to five leaflike bracts are present. The flowers are somewhat nodding. Each flower has three to five leathery sepals that mostly end in a stretched tip, making it \\"leafy\\", but sometimes one and rarely two sepals may be obovate with a rounded tip, which do not fall after flowering. The corolla usually consists of six to nine oblong cyclamen or rarely pink to white petals of 3-6½ × 1½-3 cm. Towards the centre of the flower are many stamens consisting of filaments of ½–1 cm topped with anthers that ripen from the inside out, open with slits and release yellow pollen. The pollen is released in sets of four grains together. Dependent on latitude and altitude flowers open between April and July and are said to smell like Lily of the valley. Petals and stamens are shed after flowering. The two to five carpels are initially pale yellow with reddish stigmas, but eventually become green, may be hairless or covered in soft felty hairs. Within, several large, initially red but eventually shiny black seeds of 6×4 mm develop, and each carpel opens by a slit over the entire length. Ripe seedheads may be present during August and September.  Differences with related species  Few other peony species are non-woody and have finely segmented leaves. Paeonia tenuifolia has even more divided leaves with narrowed segments of up to 6 mm wide, the basal leaves consisting of more than one hundred and thirty segments. Paeonia emodi has about 15 entire segments per basal leaf. P. anomala however strongly resembles Paeonia intermedia, from which it can be distinguished because the latter has many spindle-shaped roots and at least the two innermost sepals are rounded. Even more morphologically alike is Paeonia veitchii which differs only from this species because it usually has two to four flowers per stem in addition to two undeveloped buds, rather than only one flower, rarely two, in addition to few undeveloped buds.  Taxonomy  seeds  Taxonomic history  Paeonia anomala was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1771, based on a plant from Siberia. Pallas described in 1789 three further species, P. laciniata and P. siberiaca also from Siberia, and P. hybrida which developed from seed supposedly from a specimen of P. tenuifolia in the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden. In 1818 Anderson merely recognized P. anomala, considering P. hybrida a synonym of P. tenuifolia. In the same year Augustin Pyramus de Candolle distinguished between P. laciniata, P. anomala and P. hybrida, but synonymized P. laciniata with P. anomala in 1824. In 1830 Meyer named a fourth species, P. intermedia, that had been collected in the Altai Mountains. Ledebour (1842) cited P. hybrida and P. intermedia, but treated P. laciniata as a synonym of P. anomala. Von Trautvetter in 1860 thought there was but one species, and treated P. hybrida as a variety of P. anomala, while considering P. intermedia as a form within that variety. The widest delineation of P. anomala was made by Ernst Huth in 1892 who included var. typica, var. hybrida (now P. intermedia), var. nudicarpa, and var. emodi (now P. emodi). Krylov in 1901 thought there were two species, P. anomala, and P. hybrida consisting of var. hybrida and var. intermedia. In 1904 Trautvetter treated P. intermedia as a subspecies of P. anomala. Nikolai Schipczinsky grouped P. anomala, P. hybrida and as its variety intermedia together in the series Dentatae with the common character \\"leaf lobes incised or with dentate margin\\" in the 1937 Flora of the USSR. Stern acknowledged one species, P. anomala with two varieries: anomala with hairless fruits and intermedia with soft hairs. According to Hong and Pan, hairiness of the fruits varies in both P. anomala and P. veitchii and the only character that consistently differs between the two taxa is the usual number of fully developing flowers per stem: one for P. anomala and two to four in P. veitchii. This was the reason to propose to reduce the status of these taxa to P. anomala ssp. anomala and P. anomala ssp. veitchii respectively.  Modern classification  Although some modern literature still regards P. veitchii as a subspecies of P. anomala, recent genetic analysis has shown that P. anomala, although being a diploid, is the result of a cross between Paeonia lactiflora and P. veitchii. Morphologically, P. anomala is very similar to P. veitchii nonetheless, and very different from P. lactiflora. P. anomala and P. veitchii also share a common chemistry, such as specific unique anthocyanins.  Etymology  The species name anomala, meaning \\"deviant\\" is said to refer to the autumn color, which is unique among peonies.  Distribution and ecology  P. anomala is known from Russia, ranging from the Kola Peninsula to the Altai Republic and Lake Baikal, northeastern Kazakhstan, China (northwest Xinjang) and northern Mongolia. It has become naturalized in Finland. It grows in relatively moist circumstances like coniferous and deciduous forests, valleys and meadows, at the southern end at 1000–2500 m altitude, but further north down to sea level. Its northernmost population in the Taz River valley, grows in a forest with dwarfed trees like Larix sibirica, Betula pubescens, Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa, Sorbus aucuparia subsp. sibirica, shrubs like Rosa majalis, Lonicera pallasii, Ribes spicatum subsp. hispidulum, and grasses like Calamagrostis canescens. P. anomala is self-fertile. Mammals, such as deer or rabbits do not eat it.  Cultivation  P. anomala used to be grown in botanical gardens, but is now becoming available for gardeners as an ornamental. It is easy to grow and prefers a neutral or slightly alkaline, deep rich soil, but is also coping with lime. It does equally well in sun or dapple shade. Plants are intolerant of waterlogged or very dry soil. On sandy soils plants generally produce more leaves and less flowers. As can be expected from a species from Siberia, it survives temperatures down to at least -25 °C. The plants have good ornamental value and may survive in gardens for at least 50 years. This peony inhibits the growth of adjacent plants, especially legumes. All peonies dislike disturbance of their roots, and need time to recover after being replanted or divided.  Use  In the late 19th century, P. anomala roots were eaten raw and crumbled in soup in the North- West of Siberia by the Khakas people. In Mongolia, fruits and roots of Paeonia anomala are used to treat lower abdominal pain, indigestion, kidney diseases, nocturnal enuresis, bleeding, blood clotting, exhaustion and respiratory diseases in traditional medicine. Extract of the fruit protects against oxidative stress, by free radical scavenging, higher glutathione concentrations in the cells, and inhibiting damage to the DNA. Compounds such as ellagic acid, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, fischeroside B, and quercetin derivatives are responsible for this protection.

Early life Martin was born in Newton, Massachusetts. He graduated from Newton High School in 1927, the American Institute of Banking in 1931, and Suffolk University Law School in 1936. Martin resided in Lexington, Massachusetts, where he was member of the town's School Committee. Prior to joining the Attorney General's office he was a member of the Federal Renegotiation Board. Attorney General's office During the 1962 election, Martin served as Attorney General candidate Edward Brooke's campaign coordinator in the suburbs west of Boston. When Brooke took office in January 1963 he named Martin Chief of the Financial Division. While in this position, Martin felt that he needed a better background in tax law, so he attended Boston University School of Law at nights and earned a master of laws in taxation. When the position of First Deputy Attorney General opened up in 1964, Brooke appointed Martin. As First Deputy, he was responsible for the day to day operations of the Attorney General's office. He also maintained a private law practice during this time. Attorney General In the 1966 election, Brooke was elected to the United States Senate and Elliot Richardson was elected Attorney General. Brooke resigned as Attorney General on January 2, 1967 to take his Senate seat. He recommended that Martin be appointed to succeed him. As the legislature was not in session, the only person with the authority to appoint an Attorney General was Governor John A. Volpe, who appointed Martin. Martin served as Attorney General until January 18, when Richardson's term began. Belotti investigation During his tenure as Attorney General, Martin's office continued a controversial investigation into former Lieutenant Governor Francis X. Bellotti. Bellotti, the Democratic nominee for Attorney General in 1966, had been accused by Richardson during the campaign of receiving money from Nationwide Insurance while serving Lieutenant Governor for work before the state Insurance Department. Bellotti claimed that the investigation was \\"patently political\\" and criticized Brooke, who had initiated the investigation before leaving office, for \\"white-wash[ing]\\" the brother of Republican governor John A. Volpe, but finding \\"cause to recommend further investigation against me, a Democrat\\". The investigation was not closed during Martin's time in office and Richardson appointed a special panel in an informal trusteeship to review the case. Bellotti was cleared by the panel. Judicial career From 1967 to 1969, Martin served as Volpe's chief secretary. He was later appointed as a special justice of the West Roxbury District Court. He took his seat on January 17, 1969. On August 27, 1969, Acting Governor Francis W. Sargent nominated Martin to be a judge on the Middlesex Probate Court. His appointment was confirmed by the Massachusetts Governor's Council on September 10, 1969. He retired from the bench on April 25, 1980. Death In 1984, Martin died unexpectedly while on vacation in Bermuda.

It has slender carrot-shaped roots, leaves mostly consisting of nine leaflets, with one flower per stem. The flower is subtended by none to two leafy bracts, and has two or three sepals, five to eight petals, and many stamens. The subspecies vary in the colour of the petals (white, light yellow, pink, red), the size and shape of the leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and the carpels. Paeonia daurica can be found from the Balkans to Iran, and the Crimea to Lebanon, with the centre of its distribution in the Caucasus. It is also cultivated as an ornamental.  Description  Paeonia daurica is a perennial herbaceous photosynthesising plant, emerging in spring and retreating underground in the autumn. It has slender carrot-shaped roots which are directed downwards. The leaves are alternately set along the stems and have an outline of 5–11½ × 8–17 cm. The lower leaves are usually composed of three sets of three entire or sometimes bifid leaflets, and occasionally there is third order division, resulting in a maximum of nineteen leaflets. The shape of the leaflets is wide to narrowly oval, with the largest width at midlength or towards the tip. The base of the leaflets is more or less wedge-shaped or sometimes rounded, the margin is entire and sometimes wavy, and the tip is rounded or has a smaller or larger sharp tip. The upper surface of the leaf is hairless, while the undersides are hairless or sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs. The hermaphrodite flowers are set individually at the end of the stems and are subtended by none to two leafy bracts. The flower itself consists of two or three green sepals, five to eight petals, that may be white, pale yellow, yellow, yellow with a red blotch at the base or with a reddish margin, pink, red, or purple-red, and many stamens consisting of pale, yellow, pink or purple filaments topped by anthers that contain yellow pollen. At the very centre of each flower are one to five carpels that are glabrous, sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs and almost directly tipped by the stigmas which are mostly curved or S-shaped from above.  Subspecies  Paeonia daurica subsp. daurica and Paeonia daurica subsp. coriifolia both have red petals and the undersides of the leaves is hairless or carries sparse felty hairs. The typical subspecies however has broad ovate leaflets with a rounded or truncated tip, while subsp. coriifolia has obovate to oblong leaflets with a rounded to pointed tip. P. daurica subsp. mlokosewitschii usually has inverted egg-shaped leaves with a rounded ends that very suddenly develop into small but sharp tips, with its undersides mostly sparsely or rather densely covered soft hairs, but sometimes hairless. P. daurica subsp. wittmanniana has leaflets that vary in hairiness. Its flowers have one to three hairless or sparsely felty carpels and yellow petals that may have a pink spot at the base. P. daurica subsp. macrophylla has larger leaflets and consistently hairless carpels. P. daurica subsp. tomentosa can be distinguished by leaflets with a mostly dense covering of felty hairs on the lower surface and on the carpels. In P. daurica subsp. velebitensis, the lower leaves consist of three sets of three leaflets each, which are inverted egg- shaped or sometimes longish oval, with a rounded tip that may end in a point, and are covered in felty hair on the underside, while the two of three ovaries are felty as well.

A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P. wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P. wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P. corallina and P. corallina var. triternata, and P. wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P. triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P. corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P. wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow was the first to think that a difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P. wittmanniana to P. corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P. corallina, P. mlokosewitschii, P. macrophylla, P. wittmanniana, and introduced P. wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P. triternata and P. corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P. corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P. wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P. mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P. corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P. mlokosewitschii, P. wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P. tomentosa and the new P. abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P. mlokosewitschii – as part of the series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets – and P. triternata, P. caucasica, P. wittmanniana, P. macrophylla, P. tomentosa and P. abchasica – all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P. daurica, P. mlokosewitschii and P. wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P. kavachensis (= P. caucasica), P. mlokosewitschii (including P. tomentosa) and P. wittmanniana (including P. abchasica). P. wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P. steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia- Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P. abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P. ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.  Modern classification, subdivision and synonymy  Paeonia corallina is a synonym of Paeonia mascula, so cannot be applied to the taxa of P. daurica. According to the most recent taxonomic review of this complex of taxa, no morphological differences occur that are distinct enough to recognize separate species. There are however sufficient differences between the average character states between populations to make a distinction between seven subtaxa useful. * Leaflets are broad ovate with a rounded to obtuse tip, hairless or sparsely villose or pilose, the petals are red, and the genome is diploid (2n=10). → P. daurica subsp. daurica = P. corallina var. triternatiformis * Leaflets are obovate to oblong with a rounded to pointed tip, hairless or sparsely villose or pilose, the petals are red, and the genome is diploid (2n=10). → P. daurica subsp. coriifolia = P. triternata f. coriifolia, P. corallina subsp. triternata var. coriifolia, P. caucasica var. coriifolia, P. corallina var. caucasica, P. caucasica, P. ruprechtiana, P. kavachensis Grossheim auct. non Aznavour var. coriifolia, P. triternata Ruprecht auct. non Pall. ex.

The typical P. daurica subsp. daurica is widespread, but is not sympatric with the other subspecies, and does not occur in the Velebit, Caucasus and Alborz mountains. P. daurica subsp. coriifolia occurs at elevations below 1000 m in the west and north-west of the Caucasus and it is found in deciduous forests dominated by oak, beech, elm, maple and ash or in mixed forests of fir, oak and beech, growing on a wide range of limestone, sandstone and volcanic rocks. P. daurica subsp. mlokosewitschii is only known from eastern Georgia, north-western Azerbaijan and adjacent Russia, where it grows in deciduous oak, beech, elm, maple and chestnut forests. P. daurica subsp. wittmanniana is found in north- western Georgia and the upper reaches of the Mzymta River in adjacent Russia where it grows in both deciduous forests and subalpine and alpine meadows between 1000 and 2300 m, only on limestone. P. daurica subsp. macrophylla is confined to the mountains of south-western Georgia and north-eastern Turkey from 1200 to 2200 m, although it has been found as low as 800 m. It can be found in deciduous or mixed forests and in glades, but there seems to be no preference for any soil type. P. daurica subsp. tomentosa occurs in the Talysch and Alborz Mountains in south-eastern Azerbaijan and northern Iran where it occurs in deciduous forests and pastures on poor soils derived from sandstone at altitudes between 1100 and 1800 m. P. daurica subsp. velebitensis only grows at elevations between 900 and 1200 m in the Velebit Mountains (Dinaric Alps) of Croatia.  Ecology  With its hairless leaves, P. daurica, does not seem te be adapted to a typical Mediterranean climate, but to rather more humid circumstances in summer. The population on Mount Orjen grows in forest consisting of silver fir, European beech, Turkish hazel, the maple species Acer pseudoplatanus and A. intermedium, and ash, and is further accompanied by widespread species such as European spindle, mountain cherry, drooping bittercress, Turk's cap lily, but also with endemics such as the Orjen iris.  Cultivation  Several subspecies of P. daurica are on offer as seed or plants (daurica, coriifolia, tomentosa, macrophylla, mlokosewitschii and wittmanniana) and are collected by specialist gardeners. These are said to be hardy in western Europe and suitable for normal garden conditions, the lowland taxa with preference for more or less shady circumstances.

Boudin, in a photo taken at the time of his publication of his first book in 1907. Louis B. Boudin (December 15, 1874 – 1952) was a Russian-born American Marxist theoretician, writer, politician, and lawyer. He is the author of a two volume polemic on the Supreme Court's influence on American government, first published in 1932. Early life He was born Louis Boudianoff (Leib Budiansky) in Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi, Cherkassy Oblast, Ukraine, then under the rule of imperial Russia on February 15, 1874. He was born into a middle-class Jewish family, the son of a shirt manufacturer.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 23. The family emigrated to America in June 1891 and settled in New York City.Paul Buhle, \\"Louis B. Boudin\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; pp. 102–103. Louis worked in the garment industry as a shirtmaker and as a private tutor. At the same time, Boudin began legal studies, gaining a Master's Degree from New York University and being admitted to the New York State Bar Association in 1898. Political career At first, Boudin was a member of the Socialist Labor Party of America. He was also a member of the governing National Executive Board of the party's trade union affiliate, the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance from 1898 to 1899. Boudin left the Socialist Labor Party during the party fight of 1899, casting his lot with the dissident faction headed by Morris Hillquit and Henry Slobodin. This dissident organization eventually became one of the main pillars of the new Socialist Party of America, established in the summer of 1901. Boudin was elected a delegate of the Socialist Party of America to the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907 and the 1910 Copenhagen Congress of the Second International. Boudin was frequently a candidate for public office on the Socialist Party ticket. He ran for Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1910, 1914 and 1917, and for Chief Judge in 1916. He also ran for Justice of the New York Supreme Court (2nd District) in 1910, 1912, and 1919.Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.) \\"Louis B. Boudin\\" at PoliticalGraveyard.com Writing career Boudin wrote his first political articles on aesthetics and the materialist conception of history (historical materialism). From May 1905 through October 1906, Boudin wrote a series of articles expounding upon Marxism which were published in the Chicago magazine The International Socialist Review. These articles were collected in book form as The Theoretical System of Karl Marx in the Light of Recent Criticism in February 1907.Louis B. Boudin, The Theoretical System of Karl Marx in the Light of Recent Criticism. [1907] Chicago: Charles H. Kerr & Co., 1915. The title was published by the leading radical publishing house of the day, Charles H. Kerr & Co., and was kept in print continuously over the next two decades through several reissue editions. The book, a defense of such orthodox Marxist tenets as the labor theory of value and historical materialism against their critics of the day, established Boudin's place as one of the foremost American authorities on Marxism among a generation of young political activists. Together with Ludwig Lore and Louis C. Fraina, Boudin was a founding editor of The Class Struggle, a Marxist theoretical magazine which first saw print in May 1917. The Class Struggle published news and commentary about revolutionary socialist events in Europe, including translations of works by some of the leading figures of the Zimmerwald Left, and was an important influence on the formation of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party in 1919 — a group which provided the core of the Communist Party of America and Communist Labor Party later in that year. Boudin had left the project by this juncture, however, as a brief notice in the September–October 1918 issue indicated that he had resigned his position as an editor and member of the Socialist Publication Society owing to \\"differences concerning the policy of the magazine.\\"The Class Struggle, vol. 2, no. 4 (September–October 1918), pg. 492. Later life After the formation of the Communist Labor Party of America and the Communist Party of America, Boudin shied away from organized politics but taught in the Communist Party-sponsored Workers' School in New York in the late 1920s and occasionally contributed articles to the CP's artistic magazine, The New Masses, in the second half of the 1930s. Boudin repudiated communism by 1940 but remained a staunch defender of the civil liberties of Communist Party members. Throughout the 1930s and the 1940s, Boudin was a frequent contributor of book reviews to scholarly journals such as the Columbia Law Review, The American Journal of Sociology, and The Journal of Politics.A search of OCLC WorldCat for Louis B. Boudin as \\"author\\" generates an extensive list. In addition to working as a lawyer, winning several cases related to the rights of workers to organize trade unions, Boudin also wrote the two volume, Government by Judiciary, revisiting a topic with which he had dealt in a previous shorter book. In it, although it was never much read by the radical movement of his day, Boudin argued that the democratic rights of the people had been usurped by the judicial branch of government. While not influential with political activists of the period, Boudin's book remained in use among law students for decades, according to historian Paul Buhle. Death and legacy His papers reside at Columbia University in New York City and include the manuscript of an unpublished book, Order Out of Chaos, a study of economic crises.

It features an introduction by author Nick Tosches and an editor's note by Miriam Linna of Kicks Books. Background Since the 1950s Williams has been a singer, songwriter and producer. He recorded for Fortune Records and did work with Motown Records. He is best known for his sleazy R&B; singles - \\"Jail Bait\\" and \\"Bacon Fat.\\" He also co-wrote The Five Du-Tones' 1963 hit \\"Shake a Tail Feather\\". Sweets Prior to starting this novel, during a bout of depression, Williams entered a 42-day program at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. A longtime friend, Miriam Linna, suggested that he try his hand at fiction writing to while away the long days ahead at the center. In the book's preface, Williams describes how once in rehab he felt his mind begin to heal and felt a burst of creativity. He began writing everything down, and with Linna's editorial help, he was able to transform his rehabilitation process into the novelette, short story and song-poems comprising Sweets. At age 73, Williams had launched his fiction writing career. In November 2009 Sweets and Other Stories was published – a collection of stories. Tosches wrote in his introduction to Sweets: \\"Andre Williams has proven himself to be a survivor. The stories he has here written deserve to survive as well. They most certainly deserve to be read, as the rewards they offer are many and fine. Heed what I say. Otherwise you got nobody but your own self to blame.\\" The book is a paperback originals release by the Kicks Books imprint which hatched from Norton Records and Kicks Magazine, now celebrating its 30th anniversary. The book design is a homage to vintage PBO paperback originals. Its \\"tall\\" 7-inch format, fitting easily in a coat pocket. Kicks Books celebrated the release of Sweets on November 14, 2009 at a book reading and signing at Phyllis' Musical Inn. There was also a Q&A; session with Williams and a DJ party featuring Andre Williams' music selected and spun by DJ John Phillips. Characters and story Sweets is a narrative novelette which takes readers for a wild ride from Chicago to Houston, New Orleans, and New York City, as a teenage girl finds herself in a family way, without a family. Forced to fend for herself, she is taken under the wing of a local pimp who entices her into prostitution. The adventures that follow are a free-for-all foray through the fantastic world of pimps and their women, funeral directors, gangs and drug running, with sidebar anecdotes that are guaranteed to appall, alarm and astonish. Extreme entries remained unedited, and none of William's raw drawl storytelling style has been tampered in this standout fiction debut.

Eyre was born in Padbury, Buckinghamshire. He was educated for the merchant navy and worked as a seaman until his religious convictions led him to enter Lichfield Theological College to study for Holy Orders. He was ordained in 1865 and became curate of a number of English parishes before being appointed, in 1875, rector of Swarraton and vicar of Northington, Hampshire, where he remained for the rest of his life. Natural history and mycology Rev. Eyre had a long- standing interest in natural history. He was a member of the Hampshire Field Club and took an interest in local plants, especially species of the genus Rubus, and in land and freshwater molluscs. His botanical and conchological collections were eventually left to Haslemere Museum in Surrey, where they remain today.http://www.haslemeremuseum.co.uk/shells.html He also joined the Woolhope Club, as a result of which he developed an expertise in fungi. In 1896 he became a founder member of the British Mycological Society and was elected its president in 1903, when he gave an address on \\"mycology as an instrument of recreation\\". Eyre was also a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society, keeping local weather records, and undertook research into local history, publishing an account of his parish.Ramsbottom, J. (1915).

Basilica of St. James and St. Agnes  St Jacob and Agnes' church The Basilica of St. James and St. Agnes church complex, dedicated to St. James the Apostle and St. Agnes the Virgin and Martyr, was consecrated in 1198. However, it reached its present form in 1401–30. This 71-meter-high building is surrounded by 19 chapels located between buttresses. In its gothic interior 22 pillars support the ceiling. Numerous bishops’ tombstones deserve mentioning, with the tombstone of Balthazar von Pronto being the greatest. The church burnt down in World War II, during the heavy fighting of the Vistula–Oder Offensive of early 1945 when the Red Army pushed the German Army Group A out of southwest Poland. The church was rebuilt over a 12 year period, from 1947 through to 1958. Officially a minor basilica, the church is colloquially referred to as a cathedral, even though it is a parish church. The church is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated February 28, 2011. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.  Church bell tower (1474–1516)  It is a 43-meter-high tower, built in likeness of the bell tower in nearby () Wroclaw by three consecutive bishops – Rdesheim, Roth and Turzo. The tower was never finished (according to the plans it was supposed to be three times higher) but nevertheless it housed the 16-ton Jacob’s bell. It was heavily damaged in World War II, during the heavy fighting of the Vistula–Oder Offensive of early 1945 when the Red Army pushed the German Army Group A out of southwest Poland. The tower was repaired and renovated after the war. Currently it houses a treasury displaying masterworks of Nysa’s goldsmiths.  Bishops’ Palace (1729)  It was a stately residence imitating one of the palaces in Rome. The seat of Wroclaw bishops until 1810 it later became the location of a law court and land registry office. Presently it houses a museum.  Town Scales House (1604)  The Town Scales House The renaissance building for weight standards used in the town. Its construction was initiated by the bishop John Stichs. The building was decorated with paintings and sculptures of which only the statue of justice and some polychromes survived up to today. On one of the corners one can find a bullet from the Napoleonic siege in 1807. It was destroyed in World War II, during the heavy fighting of the Vistula–Oder Offensive of early 1945 when the Red Army pushed the German Army Group A out of southwest Poland. The Scales House was rebuilt after the war.  St. Peter and Paul Church (1720–1727)  Church belonged to the Fathers of the Holy Sepulcher. It is considered to be Nysa’s most beautiful example of baroque architecture with exquisite illusion frescos by the Schefler brothers. Beautiful interior is concentrated on descriptions of Christ’s life, however, we can find there an imitation of His grave too. But the most interesting piece in the church is a cross on the ceiling, which seems to be hanging vertically regardless of an angle from which it is viewed – masterpiece of illusion painting.  “Carolinum” (1669–1673)  Former representative seat of the Jesuit fraternity, the main founder of which was bishop Carl Ferdinand. After the liquidation of the order, the building was turned into a high school (remains so even presently), which became one of the most important schools of modern Silesia. Its most beautiful part is the beautiful baroque gate at the entrance to the building.  Virgin’s Mary Assumption Church (1629)  The church was built by the Jesuits on the site of a medieval temple. Its interior represents the distinct Jesuit style, sometimes called “Del Gesu”. The front is fitted with niches containing wooden figures of Jesuit saints. Under the Prussians the temple was changed into a storehouse  Town hall tower (1488–1499)  One of the most beautiful towers in Silesia. Originally it was 95 meters high, it was destroyed in 1945 and not rebuilt until 2009. Its present structure alludes to the historical tower and will be used as a view tower. The presently non- existing town hall was built in the 16th century; since the second half of the 18th century it was used as a Protestant garrison church, in 1885–1914 as an Old Catholic Church, and later as a display hall.  Tower gates  They were parts of Nyssa’s fortifications, those are two out of four towers, that survived till present days, they both serve as view points. Tower by Wroclaw Gate (1350 and 1550) is a 33-meter-high tower with beautifully decorated baroque portal. Tower by Ziebice Gate (1770–1701) is 42 meters high. In 1922 a stone lion figurine, allegedly looted from Ziebice, was placed above the tower entrance.  Former bishop court  Originally it was a castle standing since 1260, rebuilt and surrounded with court buildings in 1459. In 1842 the building was torn down and adapted for artillery workshops. The only part that remained is a residential and defensive towers along with a fragment of wall. The wall by the gate was marked according to water levels during floods that befell Nysa.

The class comprised two ships, Rhein and Mosel; both were built by the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen, in 1872-1874\\\\. They were armed with a pair of bronze cannon in a revolving gun turret. The ships were intended to protect the German border with France in the event of a conflict, but had short service lives, as war did not come. They served briefly in the defenses of Coblenz, starting in 1875, before being withdrawn from service. The two ships were sold for scrap, apparently in December 1884. Design In the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the Imperial German Navy decided that it needed to build river gunboats for service on the Rhine and Moselle to defend the German border. This decision came despite the Navy having seen the French Navy's negative experiences with similar gunboats during the war. The German Navy decided that two armored gunboats were necessary, and awarded the contract to AG Weser to design and build the vessels. The design staff based their work on a pair of Austro-Hungarian monitors, and , that had been recently built for service on the Danube.Hildebrand, Röhr, & Steinmetz, pp. 68-69 Characteristics Rhein and Mosel were long at the waterline and long overall, and had a beam of . At cruising load, the monitors had a forward draft of , an aft draft of , and a maximum draft of . Freeboard was forward and aft. The ships were designed to partially flood for combat, which would submerge the hull so only the upper casemate and gun turret would be above water. This reduced the freeboard to and , respectively. The ships had a designed displacement of , and at full load they displaced . The hulls were constructed with transverse iron frames. The ships had a crew of one officer and twenty-two enlisted men, and both carried a single boat.Gröner, p. 136 The ships were powered by two horizontal 2-cylinder single-expansion steam engines; these drove a pair of 3-bladed screws on diameter. The engines were placed in a single engine room. Two locomotive boilers with two fireboxes apiece supplied steam to the engines; they were located in a separate boiler room. The engines were rated at and a top speed of . In service, they were capable of 48 nominal horsepower and . The ships maneuvered slowly and turned poorly, especially steaming downstream. They did not handle well upstream either, particularly in turning against the current. Handling while the ships were flooded for combat was especially dangerous. The ships were each armed with a pair of L/19 bronze cannon manufactured by Krupp;Brassey, p. 582 they were rifled, muzzle-loading guns, mounted in a single revolving gun turret placed on an armored casemate amidships.Gardiner, p. 261 The guns fired a 36-pound shot,Brassey, p. 217 and were supplied with 300 rounds of ammunition. The ships were protected with a combination of wrought iron armor and teak. The turret sides were armored with of iron, backed with of teak; the roofs were thick. The conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof. The casemate was protected with 65 mm of armor plate on the sides. Service history The intention for Rhein and Mosel was to use them to defend the railway bridges on the Rhine in the event of a French war of revenge after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-1871. The ships were both built at the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen, under construction numbers 23 and 24, respectively. The Rhine Railway Company was compelled to contribute 300,000 Thalers to the construction of the ships, as they were intended to defend the railway bridges the company used at Rheinhausen. Both ships were laid down in 1872 and launched later that year; they were both commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 25 April 1874. They spent the first year of their career at Rheinhausen, and in April 1875 both vessels embarked on a test cruise to Strassburg. On 7 April, when they were transferred to the defenses of Coblenz.Dislère, p. 81 By the time the two monitors entered service, the prospect of a French attack had decreased, prompting the Navy to question the usefulness of retaining the vessels. As a result, they were quickly removed from service. The ultimate fate of the two ships is unclear; according to naval historian Erich Gröner, both ships were sold for 3,500 gold marks in December 1875. Robert Gardiner, however, states that the ships remained, out of service, until 1884, when they were sold for scrapping. The latter version would appear to be correct, as J.F. von Kronenfels published an elevation and deckplan of Rhein in 1881, with the inference that Rhein and Mosel were still extant at that time.von Kronenfels, Fig. 53 and Fig. 54 Notes References    Category:Ironclad warships of the Imperial German Navy Category:Ships built in Bremen (state) Category:Riverine warfare ","title":"Rhein-class monitor"},{"id":"26197708","text":"James Clifford Brown (1923–2004) was an English composer, former Senior Lecturer in the Department of Music and Organist at the University of Leeds.

Background Willy Rosenstein was born on 28 January 1892 in Stuttgart, Germany.Franks et al 1993, pp. 191-192. Rosenstein had an early interest in aviation, gaining pilot's license No. 170 on 14 March 1912. The record of his licensure records his profession as \\"flight instructor\\"; this means he was a self-taught pilot from before the start of pilot licensing. Having gained his license, he set up shop as a flight instructor at Johannisthal Air Field in Berlin in 1913. Involvement in World War 1 Rosenstein volunteered for military service, joining the Imperial German Army's 95th Infantry Regiment. He quickly transferred to the Die Fliegertruppen, and was forwarded to aviation training at Gotha on 24 August 1914. While training at Fliegerersatz-Abteilung (Replacement Detachment) 5, he was promoted twice; the latter promotion, to Vizefeldwebel came on 24 November 1914. From there, he was posted to Flieger-Abteilung (Flier Detachment) 19 on 6 March 1915. On 29 March, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. His native Kingdom of Württemberg awarded him its Silver Military Service Medal on 21 August 1915. His unit at this stage was still FA 19, based at Porcher. From there, Rosenstein travelled to the Fokker factory at Schwerin to collect the unit's first Fokker Eindecker. He undertook twenty-five hours of testing and completed twenty-three combat flights on the type during September and October 1915.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 21 On 17 February 1916, Rosenstein was commissioned as a Leutnant. On 28 April 1916, he was wounded in action over the Battle of Verdun. He was then awarded the Iron Cross First Class, having flown 180 combat sorties to date. Upon recovery, he reported to 3rd Army as a Fokker pilot. He became one of the founding members of one of Germany's brand-new fighter squadrons, Jagdstaffel 9, founded 23 September 1916. He moved on to Jagdstaffel 27 on 15 February 1917. While there, he frequently flew wingman to Hermann Göring. However, it would not be until 21 September that he scored his first aerial victory, when he shot down an Airco DH.4 over Zonnebeke while on a morning patrol. Five days later, his victim was a Sopwith Camel. Then, in an unusual twist, he was sent for aerial observer's training. On 8 January 1918, he was posted to Kampfeinsitzerstaffel (Combat Single-seater Squadron) 1a. He was passed on to serve in Kampfeinsitzerstaffel (Combat Single-seater Squadron) 1b on 4 April 1918. Flying with them, he scored his third aerial victory on 26 June, when he downed another DH.4. On 2 July 1918, he received his final war posting, to Jagdstaffel 40. He promptly shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a on 14 July. On 28 September, he received his native kingdom's award of the Knight's Cross 2nd Class with Swords of the Order of the Zahringer Lion. The following day, he began a run of five victories that took him through 27 October 1918. At about this time, Rosenstein was nominated for the House Order of Hohenzollern. The war ended without Rosenstein scoring a ninth victory or receiving the Hohenzollern. Later life Willy Rosenstein became a glider pilot sportsman postwar. In the 1930s, he emigrated to the Union of South Africa. This is probably linked to the Nazi antipathy toward Judaism, as Rosenstein was Jewish. Rosenstein took to farming, though he kept his interest in aviation. His son Ernest became a fighter pilot for the South African Air Force during World War II, being killed in action over Italy on 2 April 1945. Willy Rosenstein survived both his son and the war. He was killed on 23 May 1949 in a midair collision with a student pilot over his farm in Rustenburg, South Africa. Notes References * Norman Franks, Frank W. Bailey, Russell Guest (1993).

Biography  Antoine René Thévenard was born to Antoine-Jean-Marie Thévenard, then a captain of the French East India Company. He was killed on 1 August 1798 during the Battle of the Nile. In early 1793, he captained the frigate Insurgente with the rank of Lieutenant, and escorted a convoy from Nantes to Brest. He was promoted to Captain in the summer of the same year and appointed to the frigate . He took part in the Action of 21 October 1794, where a squadron under Sir Edward Pellew captured Révolutionnaire. In 1794, Thévenard captained the razée frigate Brave, on which he sailed between Brest and Cancale, cruised off Ouessant and Guernesey, and returned to Brest. He was then tasked with leading a division in the Kattegat and the North Sea, his flag on Brave and with the frigates Spartiate and Proserpine, under Villemadrin and Daugier respectively. Thévenard also took part in the Biscay campaign of June 1795 on Brave. In 1795, Thévenard was appointed to command of the 74-gun Wattignies, on which he sailed from Lorient to Île-d'Aix. In 1796, Thévenard led the naval division of Saint-Domingue, with his flag on Wattignies; he was promoted to chef de division in the same year. In December, he took part in the Expédition d'Irlande. Thévenard commanded the 74-gun Aquilon at the battle of the Nile. Early in the battle he used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, HMS Vanguard, which consequently suffered over 100 casualties, including Nelson, wounded by a piece of shot in the forehead. Thévenard was killed on the first day of the battle; captured Aquilon.

Background Base Area 112 was a Viet Cong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) base area located in the mountains of Quảng Nam Province southwest of Da Nang near the area known to the Marines as the \\"Arizona Territory\\" The base was believed to support the PAVN 21st Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 68B Rocket Regiment, 2nd Battalion, 141st Regiment and command and support units. The operational plan was for Task Force Yankee, an ad hoc unit based around the 5th Marine Regiment, to secure the An Hoa Basin together with the ARVN 1st Ranger Group, the Task Force would then construct a series of fire support bases to support operations west into the Base Area and finally destroy the Base Area. Operation Marines inspect a PAVN ammunition cache Phase 1 The operation commenced on 7 December with the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines being landed by helicopters from HMM-165 and HMM-364 into the Arizona Territory to act as a blocking force for the ARVN Rangers. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines and 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines which had just completed Operation Meade River had already moved southwest from the Liberty Bridge () into the An Hoa area. On 9 December control of the operation passed to Colonel Michael M. Spark, commander of the 3rd Marine Regiment which had recently redeployed from Quảng Trị Province. Phase 2 On 11 December following a preparatory air and artillery strike the engineers of Company B, 3rd Engineer Battalion supported by Company K, 5th Marines landed on Hill 575 8 km southwest of An Hoa Combat Base and established Firebase Lance (). On 13 December the engineers supported by Company E, 2/5 Marines established Firebase Pike () northwest of Firebase Lance. On 15 December several M-121 Combat Trap bombs were dropped on Hill 558 in an experiment to blast helicopter landing zones in dense jungle. The Combat Trap was only a partial success and Company B, 3rd Engineer Battalion supported by 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines were landed by helicopters to establish Firebase Spear () 8 km west of Firebase Lance. On 18 December 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines was landed on Hill 375 4 km southwest of Firebase Spear and established Combat Operations Base Mace (). Having established their operating bases the Marines began patrolling west into the eastern part of Base Area 112, while they found numerous abandoned bunkers, barracks and support facilities no major encounters with the PAVN/Viet Cong occurred and Phase 2 of the operation ended on 31 December 1968 Phase 3 On 1 January 1969 3/5 Marines was landed at Combat Operations Base Javelin () and proceeded to bombard Hill 508 () however heavy PAVN fire prevented a landing there and the 3/3 Marines was landed on Hill 728 and fought their way to Hill 508 seizing it by 15 January and establishing Firebase Maxwell there. The Marines then proceeded to search the western part of Base Area 112, establishing further firebases as they went and uncovering PAVN base camps and stores. On 15 January an Army UH-1H carrying COL Spark and his command group was hit by machine-gun fire near Firebase Maxwell and crashed killing all on board. On 29 January the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines on Go Noi Island observed a 300 strong PAVN force crossing the Song Ky Lam and artillery fire was directed against them, the PAVN tried to escape to the west but were engaged by Company D, 5th Marines. The fighting continued all night before the PAVN broke contact and the next morning the bodies of 72 PAVN were found. On 10 February Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines joined the operation and was landed in the Arizona Territory where they engaged numerous small PAVN units. At the end of February Company L, 3/26 Marines killed 75 PAVN and destroyed two anti-aircraft machine-gun positions. By mid-February Base Area 112 had been largely neutralized and the participating units were needed in the DMZ area, so the operation was progressively scaled back with the 3/3 Marines and the 3rd Marines command group being withdrawn on the 16th and redeployed to Đông Hà Combat Base, followed the next day by 1/3 Marines. After midnight on 23 February PAVN mortars hit An Hoa Combat Base triggering explosions in the ammunition dumps, followed by a sapper attack which was repulsed with gunship and artillery fire. At the same time firebases Maxwell and Tomahawk () were hit by mortar and sapper attacks. Due to the withdrawal of participating units from the operation it was decided to withdraw the Marines from the western firebases. On 3 March a patrol from Company M, 3/5 Marines was ambushed near Firebase Maxwell, 3 Marines were killed and 2 of the bodies were left behind as the Company withdrew. The next day the Marines recovered one of the bodies and the following day attempted to recover the other body but were ambushed again losing 2 Marines killed whose bodies also could not be recovered. On 6 March the Marines tried to recover the bodies again but were forced back by PAVN fire, the bodies were later recovered by a reconnaissance team. Firebase Tomahawk was evacuated and closed on 5 March while Maxwell was closed on 7 March. Aftermath The operation ended on 8 March 1969. Marine losses were 183 killed and 1,487 wounded, ARVN losses were 100 killed and 378 wounded.

First World War At the start of the First World War, Germany's West African colony of Togoland was isolated from the rest of the German Empire. Togoland had borders with the British Gold Coast to the west, French Dahomey to the east, and French West Africa to the north. Following the declaration of war by the British Empire on 4 August 1914, the colony was completely cut off from reinforcement. With no German military presence in Togoland in 1914, the colony was defenceless other than a police force of 660 Togolese police officers serving under 10 German sergeants. The Kamina radio transmitters prior to the outbreak of war Although containing few resources of value to Germany, Togoland was strategically vital to the defence of Germany's overseas empire, with the powerful Kamina radio transmitters near Atakpamé the only radio link between Germany and its colonies of German Southwest Africa and German East Africa, as well as the only means of radio communication between Germany and shipping in the South Atlantic. Togoland in 1914 Following the declaration of war, troops of the Gold Coast Regiment entered Togoland from the British Gold Coast and advanced on the capital, Lomé. An advance patrol of the Gold Coast Regiment encountered the German-led police force on 7 August 1914 at a factory in Nuatja, near Lomé, and the police force opened fire on the patrol. Alhaji Grunshi returned fire, the first soldier in British service to fire a shot in the war. On 8 August 1914 the commander of the police, Hauptmann Pfaeler, was shot after climbing a tree to get a better view of the Gold Coast Regiment, and resistance collapsed. German technicians destroyed the Kamina transmitters on 24 August, and Togoland surrendered to the British and French on 26 August 1914. Grunshi survived the war, having fought in three African campaigns, and as a lance corporal was Mentioned in Despatches on 5 March 1918. On 13 March 1919, now a sergeant, he was awarded the Military Medal for his part in the East African Campaign.

History Vooruit was designed by Ferdinand Dierkens and built between 1911 and 1914 and became a symbol of the socialist movement in the interwar period. The building is named after the socialist consumer organization (or cooperative) Vooruit (\\"Forward\\") (1891-1970), supported by Edward Anseele, to protect workers against the instability of capitalism. There workers could eat, drink and enjoy culture at affordable costs. As a festival and art center, Vooruit was part of the compartmentalized Flemish society until World War II. After the Second World War the building deteriorated until the re-launch in 1982 in its present form as a cultural center. In 1983 Vooruit was recognized as a listed monument. The building continued operating during the restoration process, from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, a fully restored Vooruit was awarded the Flemish Monument of the year Prize.

The cemetery was consecrated on 30 January 1844. It was a private Anglican cemetery financed by W. J. Broderick, Rector of Bath Abbey. The layout is a mixture of formal and informal arranged along a central avenue. It features a mortuary chapel, designed by Bath City Architect G. P. Manners in the then fashionable Norman Revival architectural style.The Victorian Society: Avon Group, \\"The Quick and the Dead: A Walk Round Some Bath Cemeteries\\", 15 September 1979. History The cemetery is on a site that was used for Roman burials, three stone coffins and Roman coins dating to Constantine the Great and Carausius having been found when the roadway to the chapel was constructed. In 1952 a further Roman coffin was discovered during the removal of a tree root from a footpath. The eccentric William Thomas Beckford was originally buried here, but moved when his former retreat of Lansdown Tower came under threat of becoming a pleasure garden and was transformed into Lansdown Cemetery in the parish of Walcot. \\"The best monuments are slightly neo-Grecian with canopied tops, dating from the 1840s. Note that to S. M. Hinds d.1847 signed Reeves, the Bath firm of Monumental masons, that flourished from c.1778 to 1860….\\" The cemetery and mortuary chapel are Grade II* listed. 37 monuments in the cemetery are Grade II or II* listed. A general trend is that the most elaborate monuments belong to individuals formerly residing at the most exclusive addresses. An interesting trend seems that clerics get Gothic Revival style monuments and military men typically get Greek Revival style monuments. The Roman Catholic Perrymead Cemetery is adjacent to Bath Abbey Cemetery. Mortuary chapel The three-bay double-height chapel was built in 1844 to designs by George Phillips Manners in the Norman Revival architectural style with a prominent west tower over a three-sided open porch / porte cochere. The chapel is built above a crypt and was planned to be flanked by open cloister wings containing a columbarium and loculi. Ever since the cemetery’s closure, the chapel has also been closed and is in a deteriorating condition. It was listed Grade II historic building on 5 August 1975, but is now Grade II* listed. It remains owned by Bath Abbey, although a lease or sale was considered to Bath’s Orthodox church, which never materialized.

Dungeons & Dragons Set 5: Immortals Rules (TSR, 1986) The Immortals Rules set contains two booklets: one is fifty-two pages long and the other is thirty-two pages. The booklets, Player's Guide to Immortals and DM's Guide to Immortals, were written by Frank Mentzer and edited by Anne Gray McCready, with cover artwork by Larry Elmore, and interior illustrations by Elmore and Jeff Easley. Harold Johnson also had a role in editing and development. Contents Immortals Rules deals with player characters that have successfully followed the courses laid out in the Master Rules for attaining immortality. This set adds a system of power points; upon achieving immortality, characters exchange all of their experience points for power points at a rate of ten thousand to one. Power points can be expended to permanently enhance attribute scores, and form a magic point system to fuel a character's new range of special abilities. Immortals advance in ranks instead of levels; a character must keep a certain balance of power points to maintain a rank, and must compete in the Olympics to gain promotion to the next rank. The combat and magic systems are also expanded to take into account the new Immortal powers. Each Immortal player character has an abundance of powers, literally able to cast any magic spell in addition to new combat abilities. The rules cover transhuman Immortal characters, their powers, artifacts, and relationships with other Immortals, and their ability to create personal \\"home planes\\". The set also includes new powerful monsters, and suggestions for adventure scenarios. The set describes the history of Immortals within the D&D; game: once there were only three Immortals, who discovered the multiverse, and decided to give it order and purpose. This set expands the D&D; multiverse system, with an Astral Plane that permeates and connects the whole of the multiverse. In addition to the Astral Plane, there are also the Prime Material Plane, elemental planes, the Ethereal Planes, and many outer planes; these outer planes range from mono- spatial atto-planes (about 1/3\\" big) to penta-spatial tera-planes (about 851 billion light-years big). The set provides notes for the Dungeon Master (DM) concerning running Immortal campaigns, which cover the goals of Immortals and their place within Immortal society, including duties and responsibilities. The DM plays the roles of the Immortals' superiors, the Hierarchs of each sphere. There are also sample plots for Immortal adventures, and twenty-two pages discussing monsters; this includes a range of demons which originally appeared in Eldritch Wizardry. Reception The Immortals Rules was reviewed by Graeme Davis in issue No. 83 of White Dwarf magazine, who referred to this set as \\"the culmination of the D&D; game system\\". Davis found the set interesting, although he could not imagine actually playing it. Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, felt that \\"Play using the Immortals rules is so different from low-level D&D; as to be almost another game entirely.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #36 (Feb 1987) References Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1986 ","title":"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Immortals Rules"},{"id":"26198265","text":"Heaven Sent () is a 1963 French comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Mocky.

According to another tradition the tank was constructed by Sultan Sikander Lodhi in the name of his sister, wife of Mir-I-Miran. Sultan Bahlol was crowned at Sirhind, he would therefore regard it as a fortunate place for himself and the area was given in Jagir by Sultan Lodhi to a holy man, together with his daughter’s hand.

An honest man, Cornie helps the inebriated Dan Sabinas, a millionaire rancher, who is being taken advantage of at another carny booth. A grateful Dan is put in a taxi, with Cornie promising to return his car. Dan drunkenly has the cab take him to Mexico instead. As Cornie and Debbie drive to Dan's hotel in his car, they end up being mistaken for Dan and wealthy sister Marilla. In time, Cornie comes to enjoy the lap of luxury and is attracted to lovely Sunshine Jackson, whose dad is the sheriff. Debbie is courted by Dan's handsome foreman, Slim Shelby, who pretends not to know she's an impostor. In a poker game, Cornie is unaware that jellybeans being used for chips are worth big money. He loses $17,000 that he can't repay unless he can win a Texas chuck wagon race. Debbie's in hot water, too, because the real Marilla is suspicious of her. Dan finally returns but can't recall who Cornie is. In an attempt to get Dan drunk again, Cornie gets tipsy instead and needs to drive his chuck wagon that way.

It stars Esther Williams and Van Johnson.http://allmovie.com/work/easy-to- love-15205 It was Williams' final aquatic film with a U.S. setting. Synopsis Ray Lloyd (Van Johnson) runs a successful Cypress Gardens water show, but star attraction Julie Hallerton (Esther Williams) is overworked and underpaid. She fibs about pretending to marry her aquatic partner Hank (John Bromfield), but is persuaded by Ray to accompany him to New York instead. Julie's hired to pose for a magazine lipstick ad when handsome singer Barry Gordon (Tony Martin) takes the place of a male model and kisses her instead. Barry offers to introduce Julie to a promoter who agrees to hire her for a New York water show he produces. Moreover, he will pay her more and treat her better than does Ray. When they return to Florida, a jealous Hank tells off Ray for not realizing how Julie truly feels. Her roommate Nancy (Edna Skinner) whacks her accidentally with a water ski, knocking Julie cold. All three men in her life rush to her side, and it appears Barry's going to win her. At the last moment, Ray realizes he is in love with Julie, and vice versa. Barry quickly turns his attention to another bathing beauty while Nancy reveals a romantic interest in Hank.

Verville and Virginius E. Clark at the United States Army Air Corps Engineering Division. A second aircraft was completed as an observation biplane and designated the Engineering Division XCO-5. Development The prototype TP-1 was built as the XTP-1 and tested at McCook Field in 1923. A biplane, the upper wing had a smaller span and narrower chord than the lower wing. The XTP-1 was armed with five machine guns and fitted with a Liberty 12 engine. A second prototype was completed as an observation/reconnaissance aircraft with the designation XCO-5. The XCO5 needed a high-lift wing suitable for high-altitude work. New wings were prepared. The aerofoil was Joukowsky StAe-27A, a heavily cambered wingshape with a thick leading edge. The upper and lower wings had a pronounced stagger, with a total wing area of 600 ft2. As well as lining and insulating the cockpit, heat was taken from the engine exhaust. A cover over the top of the cockpit kept the heat in; a clear panel in the cover allowed the pilot to see his instruments.Flight p68 Operational history On October 10, 1928, Bill Streett and Albert William Stevens achieved an unofficial altitude record in the XCO-5 for aircraft carrying more than one person: ; less than short of the official single-person altitude record. At that height they measured a temperature of , cold enough to freeze the aircraft controls. With frozen controls, Streett was unable to reduce altitude or to turn off the engine until some 20 minutes later when it ran out of fuel, after which he piloted the fragile experimental biplane down in a gentle glide and made a deadstick landing.

He was born in the Netherlands before moving to California at age of 26. He was active in Californian universities until his death. During his career he accumulated thousands of strains of yeast from the wild, and described 60 new taxa of yeast. Biography Early life and education Phaff was born in Winschoten, Netherlands. His family owned a winery where he became interested in the microorganisms involved in brewing beer and fermenting wine. He studied chemical engineering at Technical University Delft, writing a dissertation on the pectinases of Penicillium chrysogenum. On the advice of Albert Kluyver, when he was 26 years old he moved to California to study as a post-graduate at UC Berkeley. Career While at Berkeley, Phaff worked in Emil Mrak's laboratory, who is said to have had a major influence on him. When he first arrived, he was most interested in studying fruit juices, but Mrak asked him to work on yeasts, knowing he had worked in Kluyver's laboratory. His PhD was supervised by Maynard Joslyn and focussed on yeast taxonomy, ecology and physiology. After completing his PhD in 1943, he accepted a faculty position at Berkeley, before moving to the food science department of UC Davis in 1954. During the 1950s, he wrote several classic scientific papers, published in Nature on yeast pectinases with Arnold Demain. Whilst at UC Davis, he worked with the Chinese born food scientist, Bor S. Luh. In 1969 he was named University of California at Davis Faculty Research Lecturer. In 1985 he co-authored a definitive book on viticulture with Maynard Amerine. Despite officially retiring in 1983, he maintained a busy laboratory and continued to conduct research daily. His contributions to the study of yeast ecology are unparalleled. At various times in his career he was an editor of several scientific journals including the Yeast Newsletter, the Journal of Bacteriology, the Canadian Journal of Microbiology and the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology. Species classification Phaff was a pioneer of using molecular techniques to classify yeasts, along with his colleagues and students, Phaff described over 60 yeast taxa through his career. In 1976, the yeast genus Phaffia was isolated from tree exudates and was named after Phaff, by Martin Miller and two Japanese colleagues, in recognition of his contributions to yeast taxonomy and ecology. The species, Phaffia rhodozyma is economically important today because it synthesises the carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin. Yeast collection Through his 60-year career he collected 6400 yeast strains from animals, soil and plants (including over 1000 from cacti), from countries all around the world. There are few collections of microbial cultures so large that have been accumulated by institutions and likely none so large that have been accumulated by any other single researcher. The collection, known as the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection contains 400 of the 700 identified species of yeast and has been described as priceless, with a large number of wild type isolates making it unique amongst yeast collections. According to the current curator, 80% of the yeasts in the collection are not available from other sources. A 2003 yeast symposium organized by FEMS (Federation of European Microbiological Societies) was named in his memory and the talks were summarised in a special edition of International Microbiology.

Introduced in 2006, the firearm is designed for police and consumer markets. History \\"M&P;\\" stands for \\"Military & Police\\" and is used to pay homage to the Smith & Wesson .38 Military & Police revolver. According to the company, the .38 Military & Police, now known as the Model 10 revolver, has been in continuous production since 1899, and over six million units have been produced.\\"https://www.smith- wesson.com/company/history The M&P15; was introduced at the 2006 SHOT Show in two varieties: the M&P15; and the M&P15T.; Both are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, with the T-model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail fore end. They include the standard direct impingement gas system. In order to decrease cost on the original design both the dust cover and forward assist were omitted. These rifles were initially produced for S&W; by Stag Arms, but marked and marketed under the Smith & Wesson name. Currently, Smith & Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house, while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center Arms, an S&W; company acquired in 2007. Smith & Wesson's total rifle production has increased through the years since it entered the rifle market. In the past, the company had marketed rifles and shotguns made by other manufacturers, but had not manufactured a long gun in house since World War II to fulfill a British military contract. Smith & Wesson made this entry into the long gun market because it was estimated in 2007 as a $1.1 billion market, 80% larger than the U.S. handgun market. Direct impingement Short-stroke gas piston In May 2008, Smith & Wesson introduced their first AR-15 rifle in new caliber, the model M&P15R;, a standard AR platform rifle chambered for the Russian 5.45×39mm cartridge. This was due to the availability cheap surplus Communist Bloc 5.45mm ammunition and AK-series weapons. However, few shooters wanted an expensive AR-15 clone in a non-standard caliber that needed special magazines. As a result, the model was soon abandoned due to poor sales. Smith & Wesson announced their first short- stroke gas piston action rifle, the S&W; M&P15; PS and PSX (piston AR-15) in January 2009. The S&W; M&P15; Sport and S&W; M&P15; Whisper were released in 2011. The Smith & Wesson M&P10;, a version of the AR-10, was introduced in 2013. Smith & Wesson's M&P15; Sport II was introduced in 2016. It includes additional features of a forward bolt assist and dust cover not found on the original M&P15; model. Design The rifle model is based on the AR-15. Smith & Wesson offers the M&P15; semi-automatic rifles in different configurations, tailored to specific shooting applications and styles. The rifle has different models that come chambered in 5.56mm NATO/.223 Remington, .22 Long Rifle, and 5.45×39mm. The barrels come with either a melonite lined or chrome-lined 4140 steel rifling, and 7075 T6 aluminum receiver with a hard-coat black anodized finish. The Standard model has an adjustable CAR-15 stock and comes with 10-round or 30-round magazine. The Compliant model (designed for the California market) has a CAR-15 stock fixed in the open position (with an overall length of 33.75 inches) and comes with 10-round magazines. The Smith & Wesson Performance Center target shooting version has an 18-inch bull barrel threaded to take any AR-15/M16-style compensator, a free-floated forend, integral Picatinny rail system and ships with a 10-round magazine.

The college admits undergraduates and post- graduates, and awards degrees from the University of Calcutta. It is a state government administered college and is in one of the more cosmopolitan localities of the city.  History  Lady Brabourne College was established in July 1939 at a rented house in Park Circus in Calcutta (now Kolkata), following the initiative of the then Prime Minister of Bengal, A. K. Fazlul Huq. It was named after Doreen, Baroness Brabourne, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat who was the wife of His Excellency The 5th Baron Brabourne, the then Governor of Bengal. Lord Brabourne died on 23 February 1939. Sir John Herbert, the next Governor, laid down the foundation stone of the college on 26 August 1939. The college had 50 percent reserved seats for Muslim women and the rest for Hindus, Parsees, Sikhs, Jains and other ethnic communities. The hostel facility was kept exclusively for Muslims. The college started admitting Hindu students due to shortage of Muslim students. It has since become difficult for Muslim students to get admission to the college according to the All India Minority Association. In 2017 the college along with others affiliated with the University of Calcutta were given permission to provide PhD to their students.

It stars Billy Dee Williams and Clifton Davis. Its script won an award from the Writers Guild of America in 1979.Pearce, Carol A. (April 13, 1979). \\"Writers Guild Presents Awards\\". Back Stage. p. 15. The only other composers mentioned as worthy equals in the film are John Philip Sousa and Jelly Roll Morton, although Eubie Blake does make an appearance. Plot In the late 19th century, Scott Joplin, a young African-American musician, moves to Missouri and to make ends meet finds a job as a piano teacher. He befriends Louis Chauvin, and others, who play piano in a brothel. Joplin composes ragtime music. One day his \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" is heard by John Stark, a publisher of sheet music in St. Louis. Stark is impressed, buys the rights to the composition and sells it, with Joplin sharing some of the profits. Joplin's new songs also achieve a great popularity. Chauvin is equally talented, but contracts syphilis and dies in his 20s. Joplin, meantime, becomes obsessed with composing more serious music, yet is continually thwarted in his attempt to write and publish an opera. Cast * Billy Dee Williams as Scott Joplin * Clifton Davis as Louis Chauvin * Margaret Avery as Belle Joplin * Eubie Blake as Will Williams, the judge of the piano cutting contest on August 18, 1899 * Godfrey Cambridge as Tom Turpin * Art Carney as John Stark Production The film was made as a TV movie that was to air on NBC as Motown Productions' first venture into dramatic television. However, the film was given a theatrical release instead after Universal Pictures executives thought it had box office potential. Reception After the film tested poorly in Phoenix but strongly in Washington, it was marketed primarily to black audiences. A review in Variety stated, \\"Williams is fine, and the film has a lot of verve and intensity, but the story of Joplin's life is so grim it makes the film a real downer. Another problem is that the Motown Production was originally intended for tv, and shows it in the choppy episodic structure and corner-cutting production values.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Scott Joplin\\". Variety. February 9, 1977. 22. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded 2 stars out of 4 and called it \\"a turgid film\\" consisting of \\"two Joplin successes and a whole mess of failures. Both successes come in the film's first 30 minutes ... From then on the film is a downer.\\"Siskel, Gene (September 27, 1977). \\"Films reflect fall attitude: Don't compete with the tube\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 6. Hollie J. West of The Washington Post wrote, \\"The film was originally intended for television, and may wind up there yet. Lingering close-ups are plentiful, and the dramatic content fleshless and simplistic. As Joplin, Billy Dee Williams is believable. But he is ensnared in a screenplay which presents the greatest ragtime composer on only two levels: driven by a desire to become an accepted composer, and tormented by a crippling case of syphilis.\\"West, Hollie J.
