She was launched in 1860, and lent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board for use as a hospital ship in 1881, and sold to them in 1885. Atlas served until 1904, when she was sold for breaking. Description Atlas was long. She was to have been driven by a screw propeller. Had she been completed, her complement would have been 860 men. History The early years A sister ship to , Atlas was to have been a 91-gun second rate ship of the line. She was built at Chatham Dockyard, Kent. Laid down in 1858, Atlas was one of the ships under construction at Chatham that were inspected by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on 23 August 1859. Built on No. 6 Slip, Atlas was launched on 21 July 1860. The christening was performed by Mrs Schomberg, wife of Captain Schomberg. On 24 July, Atlas was taken to Sheerness to be fitted with her steam engines. By April 1861, Atlas was undergoing trials under steam. Atlas was initially earmarked for the Channel Fleet. Atlas was placed in reserve, in 1861 at Sheerness. She was reduced to 54 guns in 1870. In 1874, Atlas was transferred to Chatham Dockyard. She was totally disarmed in 1879. Hospital ship In June 1881, the Lords of the Admiralty agreed to lend Atlas and to the Metropolitan Asylums Board along with a steam pinnace, due to an outbreak of smallpox. Atlas was to be converted into a hospital ship for 250 patients. A third hospital ship was the Castali√¢. The Metropolitan Asylums Board was to insure Atlas and Endymion for ¬£11,000 and ¬£8,000 respectively. There was opposition to the proposed use of Atlas from the Thames Conservancy and other public and private bodies. Agreement had been made to lease a berth at Deptford, Kent but when the managers of a company with premises nearby learned of the proposed use of Atlas as an isolation hospital, they put pressure on the owners of the berth with the result that the owners then decided not to allow Atlas to be berthed there. She was initially stationed at Greenwich, Kent, in a berth which had been previously used for another hospital ship. This drew an objection from the shipbuilders Messrs Rennie because some of their employees refused to work near the riverside where Atlas was moored. It was also necessary to move Atlas and Endymion every time Rennie's launched a ship. Atlas was acquired by the board on 4 June, and Endymion on 5 July. Atlas housed 120 patients. In 1882, the Thames Conservancy wrote to the Metropolitan Asylums Board urging them to move Atlas and Endymion from Greenwich. The Thames Conservancy also called upon the board to pay a large claim for expenses incurred by Messrs Rennie's. At a meeting of the board, it was suggested that if moved, Atlas should be used for convalescent patients. The board decided to await the report from a Royal Commission into infectious diseases hospitals before deciding whether or not to move the ships. A ward on board Atlas In August 1882, Atlas was moved to nearby Deptford Creek. In February 1885, a meeting of the Metropolitan Asylums Board was informed that the Admiralty had stated that if the board wished to continue using Atlas and Endymion, they would have to purchase them at a cost of ¬£8,400 and ¬£6,500 respectively. The board replied that they would purchase the ships, but asked for the cost to be reduced. In June, it was reported that the board were authorised to purchase both ships. Following a fire on the training ship in 1875, engines and a generator were installed on board Atlas in 1886 to provide the ship with electric light, given that oil lamps had been deemed a fire hazard. Atlas served as a hospital ship until 1904, when the new Joyce Green Hospital opened at Dartford, Kent. Atlas was sold by auction in December, along with Endymion and Castali√¢ for a total of ¬£8,045. Atlas realised ¬£3,725.

Hancock. It was filmed at Hancock's home and apple orchard in La Porte, Indiana. His wife wrote the screenplay. The film had a limited release in theaters before being released on video. The film received a range of negative to positive reviews. It stars Marc Grapey, Rebecca Harrell, and Robert Breuler. Plot summary After his father is severely burned in Indiana, television publicist Bob Tredici leaves New York to return to his father's home and decides to live there until his father, Franco, recovers. Other reasons compelling him to stay are a lack of success in his New York business, and his cousin, Greg, being expected to inherit the family's apple orchard. Tredici comes to realize that he enjoys farming and comes to want to own the apple orchard himself, making him envious of Greg. While Franco lies in a hospital bed in his own living room, Tredici modernizes the family's orchard business by setting up a computer at his father's home and using modern marketing techniques. He asks Happy, his secretary from New York, to visit the farm and pretend to be his wife so that his father will think that he is more responsible than Greg. Tredici and Happy later become romantically attracted to each other. Tredici turns the orchard into an attraction for tourists and adds a petting zoo to it. Interspersed throughout the film, black and white flashbacks show the Tredici curse which supposedly affects the family, causing misfortune to befall them. A part of the curse is that \\"Tredici\\" is \\"13\\" in Italian. It is believed that the curse caused the failure of Tredici's New York business and his father being burnt. At the end of the film, Tredici's father has a change of heart and gives the farm to him. Production and release Hancock's wife, the actress Dorothy Tristan, wrote the film's screenplay. Hancock filmed it independently at his home in La Porte, Indiana, with the main filming location being his apple orchard. This film was Hancock's first attempt at releasing a film without a distributor. The film premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival in October 1999. He originally had issues distributing his film in theaters and the first theaters to show the film were restricted to locations in his local area. Hancock personally called theater chains to attempt to further the release of the film nationwide. When speaking with theaters, he stated, \\"This is a film that may require some patience\\". Nonetheless, the film was only released in a limited selection of theaters before being released to video. Reception Dave Kehr of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, stating, \\"At its best, A Piece of Eden finds a delicate balance between urban and rural values, progress and tradition, between experience and innocence\\". Roger Ebert gave the film 1 1/2 stars and wrote, \\"A Piece of Eden is a good- hearted film with many virtues, although riveting entertainment value is not one of them\\", concluding with \\"the story line runs out of steam about four- fifths of the way through, and the closing scenes lack dramatic interest, dissolving in a haze of landscapes and blue skies and happily-ever-after music\\". Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle gave the film 2 stars and said, \\"The homilies being taught here are so broad in their scope, and so obvious, that they come less as surprises than simple speed bumps on the road to ‚ÄúThe End\\".

Before the Battle of Genale Doria, Beyenne Merid and the 4,000 strong Army of Bale advanced down the Shebelle River with the intention of invading central Italian Somaliland. Beyene Merid and his army was able to move forward quickly due to the good terrain along the Shebelle River. In November, advancing elements of Beyenne Merid's force clashed with about 1,000 dubats of the pro-Italian Olol Diinle. Both sides withdrew from the battlefield in the end, but Beyene Merid had been seriously wounded.

She won the 2018 European Inventor Award for Small and Medium Enterprises for Sugru, a mouldable glue that was described by Time magazine as one of the world's best inventions.  Early life and education  N√≠ Dhulchaointigh was born in Kilkenny. She grew up on a farm and was constantly repairing broken items. She studied sculpture. At the age of 23 she moved to London to study product design at the Royal College of Art. Here she came up with the idea of Sugru, a mouldable elastomer that can be used to repair broken items. She combined bathroom sealant with wood-dust powder, which resulted in bouncy ball that looked like wood. She graduated in 2004. She partnered with James Carrigan and Roger Ashby to found the company FormFormForm in 2005. She spent 8,000 hours in the lab developing the product, working with silicone scientists. She demonstrated an early product at Electric Picnic. She won a ¬£35,000 grant from Nesta. They ran out of funding in 2008, and used social media and crowdfunding to raise enough money to buy machinery, develop packaging and design a website. They went on to secure ¬£250,000 from Lacomp PLC in 2006. The product eventually launched in December 2009 and sold out within 6 hours. They were featured in Boing Boing and Wired. She named Sugru after the Irish word s√∫gradh, which means play.  Career  The joystick of an Xbox controller that has been fixed with Sugru Sugru is sold in over 6,000 shops worldwide.

She launched Sugru in B&Q; shops across the UK and Ireland using a YouTube video to tell their customers about their product. By 2013, Sugru had been used on all seven continents. They collaborated with Sugru user Joanne, who had no fingers on her left hand but wanted to take part in an ultra-marathon. N√≠ Dhulchaointigh was selected by EY as one of their top entrepreneurs of the year. She was invited to give a keynote at 99U at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Her keynote, The Magic Is in The Process, discussed the six-year process from hmmm to eureka and wow!. They developed a foil handle for fencers with fencing equipment manufacturer Leon Paul. In 2014 Sugru was described by The Guardian as a wonder material. FormFormForm were estimated to turn over ¬£3.6 million a year in 2016. N√≠ Dhulchaointigh spoke at InspireFest in 2017, where she estimated that Sugru had been used to fix more than ten million items.

Shrouded cable glands going into a flow meter. Split cable gland KVT for routing pre-terminated cables A cable gland (more often known in the U.S. as a cord grip, cable strain relief, cable connector or cable fitting) is a device designed to attach and secure the end of an electrical cable to the equipment. A cable gland provides strain-relief and connects by a means suitable for the type and description of cable for which it is designed‚Äîincluding provision for making electrical connection to the armour or braid and lead or aluminium sheath of the cable, if any. Cable glands may also be used for sealing cables passing through bulkheads or gland plates. Cable glands are mostly used for cables with diameters between 1 mm and 75 mm. Cable glands are commonly defined as mechanical cable entry devices. They are used throughout a number of industries in conjunction with cable and wiring used in electrical instrumentation and automation systems. Cable glands may be used on all types of electrical power, control, instrumentation, data and telecommunications cables. They are used as a sealing and termination device to ensure that the characteristics of the enclosure which the cable enters can be maintained adequately. Cable glands are made of various plastics, and steel, brass or aluminum for industrial usage. Glands intended to resist dripping water or water pressure will include synthetic rubber or other types of elastomer seals. Certain types of cable glands may also serve to prevent entry of flammable gas into equipment enclosures, for electrical equipment in hazardous areas. Although cable glands are often called \\"connectors\\", a technical distinction can be made in the terminology, which differentiates them from quick-disconnect, conducting electrical connectors. For routing pre-terminated cables (cables with connectors), split cable glands can be used. These cable glands consist of three parts (two gland halves and a split sealing grommet) which are screwed with a hexagonal locknut (like normal cable glands). Thus, pre-assembled cables can be routed without removing the plugs. Split cable glands can reach an ingress protection of up to IP66/IP68 and NEMA 4X. Alternatively, split cable entry systems can be used (normally consisting of a hard frame and several sealing grommets) to route a large number of pre- terminated cables through one wall cut-out.

Since 1999 he has been professor of research in visual art and education at the Aalto University School of Art and Design, Helsinki. Before that he taught research methodology and acted as director of research in various Finnish universities and polytechnics (1992‚Äì1999) and before that taught philosophy at the University of Tampere (1973‚Äì1993). During the 1990s Varto produced over 100 programmes for Finnish radio and television, mainly dealing with philosophical questions. He has been awarded an honorary doctorate for theatre and drama by the Theatre Academy Helsinki. Autumn 2016, the president of Aalto University, Tuula Teeri, appointed Varto an Aalto Distinguished Professor in recognition of his significant scientific merits. July 2017, Varto retired from Aalto University. Career Varto‚Äôs early philosophical interest was in the history of logic; his mentor, professor Raili Kauppi was an internationally known Leibniz scholar and writer in intentional logic. Varto‚Äôs doctoral thesis dealt with the subject of 12th century logic. Later he wrote on questions that touch upon the relationship between formal and philosophical in logic. Varto‚Äôs main corpus of writing is in Finnish, since during his early career there were only few texts in Finnish in philosophy and even less on phenomenology. His pedagogical interest was in elaborating Plato‚Äôs texts as a starting point in philosophy. But he has also dealt with texts on Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Scheler, Adolf Reinach, Edith Stein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Emmanuel Levinas and Michel Henry. He has also studied the writings of Simone Weil and her approach to issues important to every day life. In recent years Varto has published extensive texts on aesthetics and artistic thinking and the methodology of artistic research. The Tampere School of Phenomenology The so-called ‚ÄùTampere School of Phenomenology‚Äù emerged around Varto‚Äôs scholarship activities in the 1980s. This group included both philosophers and scholars of other areas, such as politics and sociology. Today, many of his former students from that period hold leading positions in Finnish universities, as well as governmental institutions and private enterprises. The group identified itself as the ‚ÄùFinnish Phenomenological Institute‚Äù, but after Varto moved to Helsinki it became known as the ‚ÄùSociety of European Philosophy‚Äù. The Institute published 44 volumes of scholarship in phenomenology, ranging from doctoral theses to monographs on individual intellectuals and translations of works by foreign intellectuals. Like Varto himself, the Institute and later the Society has been active in civil and public discussions on issues that previously lacked any intellectual approach. Notably, in 1993 they founded the philosophical journal ‚Äùniin&n;√§in‚Äù, which became a known discussion forum, not tied to any particular school.

He was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. Career In 1973, he was recipient of the Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in the play The Hot l Baltimore at the Ivanhoe Theatre in Chicago, Illinois. In 1974 he founded the Wisdom Bridge Theatre which flourished after Robert Falls took the director's post in 1977.Hedy Weiss: White to quit Wisdom Bridge. In: Chicago Sun-Times. December 1, 1988Don B. Wilmeth, Tice L. Miller: Cambridge guide to American theatre p 408. Cambridge University Press, 1996. . The theatre's name was inspired by a painting whose subtitle read: \\"The bridge to wisdom is the continual asking of questions.\\" Beaird's first feature film The Party Animal, a comedy, was released in 1984. His next film Octavia (1984) was about a blind woman who is raped by a motorcycle gang. In 1986, he came to wider prominence with the comedy My Chauffeur starring Deborah Foreman. In 1988, he shot the comedies Pass the Ammo and It Takes Two. Beaird founded the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks, California, and he staged a successful play titled Scorchers, a play he had written about a Cajun wedding night in the bayou. The play ran for at least two years and won several awards. In 1991, he adapted the play into the movie Scorchers, with Faye Dunaway, James Earl Jones, Emily Lloyd, Jennifer Tilly, and Leland Crooke in the leading roles. In 1992, Beaird created the 13-part television series Key West in which an Ohio factory worker played by Fisher Stevens wins the lottery and goes to live the writer's life in Florida, with Hemingway as his inspiration. In 1994, Beaird brought 900 Oneonta, a black comedy about a dysfunctional family, to the stage.New York Times: Did Someone Say Mendacity? (No, Not That Play)New York Times: A House of Horrors It had its premiere at the Lyric Hammersmith in London. It later was staged in the Old Vic and then at the West End Theatre. The play was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. It was the last play at the Circle Repertory Theatre in New York City before it was closed in 1996.Thomas S. Hischak, Gerald Martin Bordman: Volume Four of the distinguished American Theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama series offers a thorough, candid, and fascinating look at the theater in New York during the last decades of the twentieth century.p 395. Oxford University Press US, 2001. Eddie Izzard, Leland Crooke, Jon Cryer, and Douglas Henshall performed in the play. Beaird married actress Shevonne Durkin in 2001. Beaird's final film, released in 2005, was The Civilization of Maxwell Bright, starring Patrick Warburton, Marie Matiko, Jennifer Tilly, Eric Roberts, and Simon Callow. The film's subject, according to Beaird, was \\"how one person pulls the other out of hell.\\" The film won awards at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, the WorldFest Houston and the Florida Film Festival in 2005. Beaird died on February 6, 2019 in Tarzana, California.

It is a single-nave church built out of concrete whose exterior and interior walls as well as the floor are covered with white marble. It was originally built without interior columns with the hexagonal dome borne just by its walls, but when the danger of the dome falling down was seen, four bearing columns were added. The church has a gallery for the choir from which hymns are performed. The church has two belfries with domes on top, one on each side of the entrance hall on the western side. The bells are pulled by electric power. The belfry domes as well as the main dome are decorated with octagonal rods.Information panel at Saint Sarkis Church, Tehran As in other Armenian churches, the half-circle altar is on the eastern side of the building. On both sides of the altar there are vestries with side entrances. The walls above the altar and its two sides are covered with paintings showing Bible themes: Saint Mary with Jesus, the Ascension of Christ into Heaven, John the Baptist baptizing Jesus and the Crucifixion of Jesus.  History  Interior of San Sarkis Cathedral Since the completion of Holy Mother of God Church in central Tehran in 1945, the Tehran prelacy was located in the premises of that church. In the early 1960s it was decided to change the site of the prelacy offices into new location. So therefore the bishop and committee members of the time asked Markar Sarkisian, an Armenian benefactor, to help them in this cause. Since Markar died soon, his sons Gurgen and Vasgen Sarkisian financed the church project in memory of their parents. The committee bought land located at the end of Villa Street (now called Nejatollahi Street). The construction of St. Sarkis Church in Tehran began in 1964 and was completed in 1970. The church was renovated in 2000.Janet D. Lazarian. Encyclopedia of Iranian Armenians. Hirmand Publication, Second Edition: 2009.

Meiotic pathways are normally restricted to germ cells. Meiotic proteins drive double stranded DNA breaks, chiasma formation, sister chromatid adhesion and rearrange the spindle apparatus. During meiosis, there are 2 sets of cell divisions, the second division is similar to mitosis in that sister chromatids are directly separated. However, in the first meiotic division the sister chromatids are held together by cohesins and segregated from their homologous pair of cohesion bound sister chromatids after resolution of recombination crossover points (chiasma) between the homologous pairs. The collision of mitosis and meiosis (first division) pathways could cause abnormal chiasma formation, abnormal cohesion expression, and mitotic/meiotic spindle defects that could result in insertions, deletions, abnormal segregation, DNA bridging, and potentially failure of cell division altogether resulting in polyploidy. Role in cancer Meiotic proteins have been noted to be expressed in cancer particularly melanoma and lymphoma. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma meiosis proteins have been shown to be regulated with the cell cycle. Lymphoma cell lines have also been noted to up-regulate meiosis specific genes with irradiation and a correlation with mitotic arrest and polyploidy has been noted. The overall role of meiomitosis in cancer development and evolution has yet to be determined.

The building is now an ambulance station. There are also two public houses, two shops, a funeral home, a community centre with a play school, a Catholic Church (Our Lady of Good Counsel) and the soccer pitch home to Loughglinn United just beside the lake. The lake is also the source of the name of the village.

Church  Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel, Loughglinn In 1798 a barn church was built in Loughglinn near the priest's graveyard, by an early monastery. It served the needs until the present Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel was built in 1905 and dedicated in 1906. It was built in a Gothic style featuring a striking octagonal bell turret with a spire, polished granite interior pillars, and richly molded arches. It was designed by William Byrne and was built using local stone and labour. Our Lady of Good Counsel was built in 1905 The church comprises side aisles, sacristy to rear, projecting entrance porches to side aisles and octagonal bell tower to front elevation. There are stepped buttresses to the front fa√ßade and rear elevations.  Convent  In 1903, Loughglinn house was sold to the Bishop of Elphin Dr Clancy who invited the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary to establish a convent, and there started a school where teenage girls would learn Home Economics. The sisters established a dairy and Loughglinn butter and cheese was famous all over the world until they ceased this activity in the 1960s. They then opened a nursing home for their own retired sisters and also had residents who were not nuns and known locally as the patients. In 2003, developer Gerry Gannon bought the convent for under ‚Ç¨2m, intending to turn it into a hotel. In 2009, after the Irish property bubble burst, it was transferred to his wife's name.  In popular culture  The local anthem is the \\"Woodlands of Loughglinn\\" dedicated to the memory of those that died in the Woodlands in April 1921. It was written by a James Keane, the father of the Rev. Bernard Keane, Chaplain at Loughlynn Convent and later parish priest at Athleague. The song has been recorded by Brendan Shine, among others.\\"The Woodlands of Loughglynn\\", O'Callaghan, Michael, (Second Edition), For Ireland and Freedom, pg 115.

It involves \\"phases\\" or \\"stages\\" inherent to Philippine society and culture.Alegre, Edilberto. Tuksuhan, Ligawan: Courtship in Philippine Culture, Tagalog Love Words (An Essay), Our loving ways, seasite.niu.edu Evident in courtship in the Philippines is the practice of singing romantic love songs, reciting poems, writing letters, and gift-giving. This respect extends to the Filipina's family members. The proper rules and standards in traditional Filipino courtship are set by Philippine society. General overview Harana (serenade) Often, a Filipino male suitor expresses his interest to a woman in a discreet and friendly manner in order to avoid being perceived as very \\"presumptuous or aggressive\\" or arrogant. Although having a series of friendly dates is the normal starting point in the Filipino way of courting, this may also begin through the process of \\"teasing\\", a process of \\"pairing off\\" a potential teenage or adult couple. The teasing is done by peers or friends of the couple being matched. The teasing practice assists in discerning the actual feelings of the male and the female involved. Traditionally, a Filipino woman is \\"shy and secretive\\" about her feelings for a suitor. On the other hand, the Filipino man fears rejection by a woman and would like to avoid losing face and embarrassment. This teasing phase actually helps in circumventing such an embarrassing predicament because formal courtship has not yet officially started. Furthermore, this \\"testing phase\\" also helps a man who could be \\"torpe\\", a Filipino term for a suitor who is shy, \\"stupid\\", and feels cowardly, and is innocent and na√Øve in how to court a woman. However, this type of admirer could overcome his shyness and naivety by asking for the help of a \\"tulay\\" (Filipino for \\"Bridge\\", whose role is similar to that of the Wingman in Western Cultures), typically a mutual friend of both the suitor and the admired, or a close friend of both families. The \\"human bridge\\" acts as the suitor's communicator. Through this \\"human- bridge\\", the bachelor can also ask permission to visit the woman at home from the bachelorette's father. As a norm, the couple will not be left alone with each other during this first home visit, because formal introductions to family members are done, which may be performed by the \\"tulay\\". Informal conversation also takes place. During this preliminary evaluation period, the Filipino woman will either deny her feelings (or the absence of feelings for the suitor) and avoids her admirer, or does not become angry because of the teasing and encourages the suitor instead. The suitor stops the courtship if he is quite sure that the woman does not reciprocate. But once the female encourages the suitor to continue, the \\"teasing stage\\" comes to a close and a \\"serious stage\\" of Philippine courtship begins. It is within this stage where the couple engages in a series of group dates, chaperoned dates, or private dates. The couple later on decides to come out into the open and reveals the status of their relationship to family members, relatives, and friends. The serious suitor or boyfriend visits the family of the woman he admires/courts or girlfriend in order to formally introduce himself, particularly to the lady's parents. Bringing gifts or pasalubong (which may include flowers, with cards, or letters, and the like) are also typical. Courting a woman in the Philippines is described as a courtship that also includes courting the woman's family.Borlongan, Josienita.

In the past, particularly in a rural courtship setting, a Filipino man, accompanied by friends, would engage in serenading the woman he adores at night. This serenading practice was an influence adopted by the Filipinos from the Spaniards. During the courtship process, a traditional Filipina is expected to play \\"hard to get\\", to act as if not interested, to be not flirty, and show utmost restraint, modesty, shyness, good upbringing, be well-mannered, demure, and reserved despite having great feelings for her admirer; a behavior culturally considered appropriate while being courted. This behavior serves as a tool in measuring the admirer's sincerity and seriousness. The woman can also have as many suitors, from which she could choose the man that she finally would want to date. Dating couples are expected to be conservative and not perform public displays of affection for each other. Traditionally, some courtship may last a number of years before the Filipino woman accepts her suitor as a boyfriend.Courtship in the Philippines Today, SarahGats's Blog, sarahgats.wordpress.com, March 29, 2009 Conservativeness, together with repressing emotions and affection, was inherited by the Filipino woman from the colonial period under the Spaniards, a characteristic referred to as the Maria Clara attitude. After the girlfriend-boyfriend stage, engagement and marriage follows. With regards to the engagement and pre-marriage stages, Filipino tradition dictates that the man and his parents perform the pamamanhikan or pamanhikan (literally, a Tagalog word that means \\"to go up the stairs of the house\\" of the girlfriend and her parents; pamamanhikan is known as tampa or danon to the Ilocanos, as pasaguli to the Palawe√±os, and as kapamalai to the Maranaos). This is where and when the man and his parents formally ask the lady's hand and blessings from her parents in order to marry. This is when the formal introduction of the man's parents and woman's parents happens. Apart from presents, the Cebuano version of the pamamanhikan includes bringing in musicians. After setting the date of the wedding and the dowry, the couple is considered officially engaged. The dowry, as a norm in the Philippines, is provided by the groom's family. For the Filipino people, marriage is a union of two families, not just of two persons. Therefore, marrying well \\"enhances the good name\\" of both families. Other courtship practices Tagalog and Ilocos regions A Tagalog couple as depicted in the Boxer Codex of the 16th century. mestizo couple from the Tagalog region during the 19th century. Apart from the general background explained above, there are other similar and unique courting practices adhered to by Filipinos in other different regions of the Philippine archipelago. In the island of Luzon, the Ilocanos also perform serenading, known to them as tapat (literally, \\"to be in front of\\" the home of the courted woman), which is similar to the harana and also to the balagtasan of the Tagalogs. The suitor begins singing a romantic song, then the courted lady responds by singing too. In reality, Harana is a musical exchange of messages which can be about waiting or loving or just saying no. The suitor initiates, the lady responds. As the Pamamaalam stage sets in, the suitor sings one last song and the haranistas disappear in the night. Rooster courtship is also another form of courting in Luzon. In this type of courtship, the rooster is assigned that task of being a \\"middleman\\", a \\"negotiator\\", or a \\"go-between\\", wherein the male chicken is left to stay in the home of the courted to crow every single morning for the admired lady's family. In the province of Bulacan in Central Luzon, the Bulaque√±os have a kind of courtship known as the naninilong (from the Tagalog word silong or \\"basement\\"). At midnight, the suitor goes beneath the nipa hut, a house that is elevated by bamboo poles, then prickles the admired woman by using a pointed object. Once the prickling caught the attention of the sleeping lady, the couple would be conversing in whispers. The Ifugao of northern Luzon practices a courtship called ca-i-sing (this practice is known as the ebgan to the Kalinga tribes and as pangis to the Tingguian tribes), wherein males and females are separated into \\"houses\\". The house for the Filipino males is called the Ato, while the house for Filipino females is known as the olog or agamang. The males visit the females in the olog ‚Äì the \\"betrothal house\\" ‚Äì to sing romantic songs. The females reply to these songs also through singing. The ongoing courtship ritual is overseen by a married elder or a childless widow who keeps the parents of the participating males and females well informed of the progress of the courtship process. After the courtship process, the Batangue√±os of Batangas has a peculiar tradition performed on the eve of the wedding. A procession, composed of the groom's mother, father, relatives, godfathers, godmothers, bridesmaids, and groomsmen, occurs. Their purpose is to bring the cooking ingredients for the celebration to the bride's home, where refreshments await them. When they are in the half process of the courtship, they are forced to make a baby Pangasinan region In Pangasinan, the Pangasinenses utilizes the taga- amo, which literally means \\"tamer\\", a form of love potions or charms which can be rubbed to the skin of the admired. It can also be in the form of drinkable potions. The suitor may also resort to the use of palabas, meaning show or drama, wherein the Filipino woman succumbs to revealing her love to her suitor, who at one time will pretend or act as if he will be committing suicide if the lady does not divulge her true feelings. Apayao region The Apayaos allow the practice of sleeping together during the night. This is known as liberal courtship or in the vernacular. This form of courting assists in assessing the woman's feeling for her lover. Palawan region In Palawan, the Palawe√±os or Palawanons perform courtship through the use of love riddles. This is known as the . The purpose of the love riddles is to assess the sentiments of the parents of both suitor and admirer. After this \\"riddle courtship\\", the discussion proceeds to the (can also be spelled ), to settle the price or form of the dowry that will be received by the courted woman from the courting man. Visayas region When courting, the Cebuanos also resort to serenading, which is known locally as . They also write love letters that are sent via a trusted friend or a relative of the courted woman. Presents are not only given to the woman being courted, but also to her relatives. Similar to the practice in the Pangasinan region, as mentioned above, the Cebuanos also use love potions to win the affection of the Filipino woman. People from Leyte performs the or or \\"servitude\\", instead of paying a form of dowry during the courtship period. In this form of courting, the Filipino suitor accomplishes household and farm chores for the family of the Filipino woman. The service normally lasts for approximately a year before the man and woman can get married. The Tagalogs of Luzon also refers to this courtship custom as meaning \\"being of service\\", but is also referred to as meaning a trial or test period for the serving suitor. The Bicolanos of Luzon's Bicol region, call this custom as the . Mindanao region Yakan couple from Mindanao performing a wedding dance. Reckless courtship, known in the vernacular as , , or , is practiced by the Tausog people of Mindanao. Similar to the version practiced in Luzon island, a suitor would threaten to stab his heart while in front of the courted woman's father. If the father of the woman refuses to give his daughter's hand to the suitor, the suitor is smitten by a knife. The Bagobo, on the other hand, sends a knife or a spear as a gift to the home of the courted woman for inspection. Accepting the weapon is equivalent to accepting the Filipino man's romantic intention and advances. Pre-arranged marriages and betrothals are common to Filipino Muslims. These formal engagements are arranged by the parents of men and the women. This also involves discussions regarding the price and the form of the dowry. The Tausog people proclaims that a wedding, a celebration or announcement known as the pangalay, will occur by playing percussive musical instruments such as the gabbang, the kulintang, and the agong. The wedding is officiated by an Imam. Readings from the Quran is a part of the ceremony, as well as the placement of the groom's fingerprint over the bride's forehead. 19th-century Hispanic Philippines During the 19th century in Spanish Philippines, there was a set of body language expressed by courted women to communicate with their suitors. These are non-verbal cues which Ambeth Ocampo referred to as \\"fan language\\". These are called as such because the woman conveys her messages through silent movements that involve a hand-held fan. Examples of such speechless communication are as follows: a courted woman covering half of her face would like her suitor to follow her; counting the ribs of the folding fan sends out a message that the lady would like to have a conversation with her admirer; holding the fan using the right hand would mean the woman is willing to have a boyfriend, while carrying the fan with the left hand signifies that she already has a lover and thus no longer available; fanning vigorously symbolizes that the lady has deep feelings for a gentleman, while fanning slowly tells that the woman courted does not have any feelings for the suitor; putting the fan aside signals that the lady does not want to be wooed by the man; and the abrupt closing of a fan means the woman dislikes the man.Ocampo, Ambeth R. Fan Language, Looking Back, Philippine Daily Inquirer, February 2, 2005, page 13, news.google.com Modern-day influences Through the liberalism of modern-day Filipinos, there have been modifications of courtship that are milder than that in the West. Present-day Filipino courtship, as in the traditional form, also starts with the \\"teasing stage\\" conducted by friends. Introductions and meetings between prospective couples are now done through a common friend or whilst attending a party. Modern technology has also become a part of present-day courting practises. Romantic conversations between both parties are now through cellular phones ‚Äì particularly through texting messages ‚Äì and the internet as can be seen by the vast amount of apps & websites catering to Filipino Dating Parents, however, still prefer that their daughters be formally courted within the confines of the home, done out of respect to the father and mother of the single woman. Although a present- day Filipina wants to encourage a man to court her or even initiate the relationship, it is still traditionally \\"inappropriate\\" for a suitor to introduce himself to an admired woman, or vice versa, while on the street. Servitude and serenading are no longer common, but avoidance of pre-marital sex is still valued. Other than the so-called modern Philippine courtship through texting and social media, there is another modern style that is not widely discussed in public discourse: North American pickup as documented by Neil Strauss in his book The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists. While there exist a few local companies that offer pickup training, it remains to be seen whether these methods will even gain widespread acceptance since these methods, along with the paradigm from which they are rooted, flout the values of most Filipinos.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United. History Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth. In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium. Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after. The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called 'New York'O.S. Maps and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Also Guest and Chrimes used to make fire hydrants for New York City. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team. Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012. The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012. The Millers won 2‚Äì1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3‚Äì0, Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground. The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history. On 8 April 2016, England women's national football team played a UEFA Women's Euro 2017 qualifying match versus Belgium at the stadium in front of 10,550 spectators. On 17 August 2018, the funeral of entertainer Barry Chuckle was held at the stadium. Chuckle had been an honorary president of Rotherham United and was a regular at the team's matches. Design The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed. It cost approximately ¬£17 million to construct. The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite. Local businesses such as Norton Finance and Premier Hytemp were some of the first members. At the beginning of the 2014‚Äì15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.

I always enjoy Crampton ‚Äì a naturally funny, likeable columnist. He's the kind of fellow you'd like to go for beer with, so he'd make a good US President. It's a real drag when he's away and a substitute fills in for him.http://www.bryanappleyard.com/blog/2008/10/robert-crampton- great-wakering-and-fan.php\\" Nigel Williams has praised his interviews: \\"Robert Crampton's work I really like. Somehow, he combines showmanship with something like self-effacement in a very entertaining way. To me he sounds like he's telling the truth, which is one of the most difficult things to pull off in journalism. His opinions sound hard-won and thought through, and that's to do with his prose style, which puts me in mind of what Orwell said about good prose being like a window\\".

It was anchored by Boscov's, Burlington Coat Factory, and Limerick Furniture. Smaller stores included Super Shoes, Planet Fitness, an AMC Classic movie theater, and Golden Eagle Comics. The mall, which once had 75 stores, had 14 stores and many vacant storefronts before it closed in 2018. It was located on 5th Street Highway, U.S. 222 Business. History Interior of Fairgrounds Square Mall in 2016 The Fairgrounds Square Mall was developed by Interstate Properties, constructed by F&S; Construction along with the Owner, Frank Saffiotti, and under the supervision of Gus, Job Site Superintendent and the Office Manager, Rebecca L. Simpson, CCA working with a labor union membership workforce representing various unions throughout the region. The mall officially opened in October 1980, with Boscov's and JCPenney serving as anchors. The mall was constructed at the former location of the Reading Fairgrounds Speedway; the Boscov's store opened as a freestanding store adjacent to the speedway in August 1965. A year later, it was purchased by First Union Real Estate Investments. A mall expansion in 1988 added several more stores as well as Phar-Mor. The mall was renovated in 1996, at which point a Montgomery Ward was built as a third anchor. The Montgomery Ward store closed in 1999. The same year, the mall was sold to Jager Management affiliate GP Properties Inc and JCPenney converted its store into an outlet format. In 2000, Jason's Furniture Outlet opened in the former Montgomery Ward anchor space. A National Wholesale Liquidators store opened in the location of Jason's Furniture Outlet in 2003, which had relocated to the former Phar-Mor. In 2005, Burlington Coat Factory replaced National Wholesale Liquidators, and Jason's became Super Shoes and Planet Fitness. In 2011, it was announced that the JCPenney Outlet would be closing as part of JCPenney's plan to eliminate outlet stores. However, it was later announced that the JCPenney Outlet division was purchased by SB Capital Group, and rebranded as JC's 5 Star Outlet. Mall owner GP-Fairgrounds Square LP defaulted on its mortgage, which led to the mall being sold to BNY Mellon for $13.6 million in a U.S. Marshals auction on March 7, 2013. JC's Five Star Outlet closed November 30, 2013. In November 2014, Limerick Furniture opened in the former JC's Five Star Outlet space, moving from a former site in St. Lawrence. On April 13, 2016, Hull Property Group took over the Fairgrounds Square Mall, with plans to revitalize the mall. In early February 2018, Limerick Furniture announced it will be closing its Fairgrounds Square Mall location due to low foot traffic and the rise of online shopping, leaving Burlington Coat Factory and Boscov's as the mall's two remaining anchor stores. As of March 2018, Fairgrounds Square Mall had 12 tenants remaining, down from a peak of 75 stores. On April 30, 2018, Hull Property Group closed the interior of the mall. Limerick Furniture closed their mall entrance a few days before the mall closed, then closed a day or two later after the mall closed. Boscov's, Burlington Coat Factory, AMC Classic, Super Shoes, Planet Fitness, Baja Beach Tanning Club, and Quest Diagnostics remained open after the mall closed. Hull Property Group had plans to redevelop the Fairgrounds Square Mall site. The redevelopment plan would demolish 68.1 percent of the mall, leaving Boscov's, Burlington Coat Factory, AMC Classic, Super Shoes, and Planet Fitness. The former site of the mall would be converted into green space with some retail stores. Other developments planned included townhomes, a hotel, and a restaurant. Plans for the redevelopment had been put on hold by a tax incentive from Muhlenberg Township that makes it impossible to redevelop the site and attract new tenants without demolishing the existing mall first. In May 2019, the tax incentive from Muhlenberg Township was denied, as the township felt the redevelopment plans were vague. As a result of the denial, Hull Property Group withdrew their redevelopment plans and announced they will continue to maintain the closed mall. However, on June 13, 2019, Hull Property Group announced it will apply for a permit to demolish 80 percent of the mall for redevelopment, leaving open tenants such as Boscov's, Burlington, Planet Fitness, Super Shoes and AMC Classic in place. Demolition of the Fairgrounds Square Mall will begin in March 2020.

He served as a Christchurch City Councillor for 22 years before being elected Mayor of Christchurch. He was a World War II veteran and he and his family were (and still are) well-known business operators in Christchurch. Early life Guthrey was born in Rawene, Hokianga on 15 January 1916. He attended Waitaki Boys' High School. He was an entrepreneur from a young age, as shown by his insurance scheme for caning. Guthrey charged a shilling a term and paid out a penny per whack. The insurance scheme folded when a number of boarders staged a sleep in and were disciplined accordingly. He saved himself by walking into town, buying a case of small apples, and because there was no tuck shop at school, was able to sell them at 100% mark- up. Military service Guthrey was a member of the New Zealand 20th Battalion during World War II. The battalion left Lyttelton on 5 January 1940 for Egypt. In November 1941 Guthrey's battalion was part of the New Zealand 4th Infantry Brigade in the 2nd New Zealand Division, he was the second lieutenant commanding the Bren Gun Carrier platoon. For a series of actions on 22 November, 23 November and on 25 November, he was recommended for the Military Cross by his battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Howard Kippenberger. Kippenberger praised Guthrey's \\"skill and dash\\" on the Bardia Road on 22 November, and called Guthey's flank attack on Bir Cleta on 23 November \\"probably decisive\\"; but most praise was reserved for his rescue of the crew of another Bren Gun Carrier under heavy artillery fire on 25 November. A few days later, during the Battle of Belhamed on 1 December 1941, Guthrey was wounded and lost a leg. He lay on the battlefield until a German burial party in a captured New Zealand truck found him and took him to a hospital. His MC was duly gazetted on 20 January 1942. He did not learn of it until some time later when his parents sent him a newspaper clipping containing this news. Political career Guthrey contested the Christchurch South electorate in the for the National Party and came a distant second to the incumbent, Labour's Robert Macfarlane. Guthrey was a Christchurch city councillor from the 1944 local election to 1968, and served as mayor from 1968 to 1971. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1968 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to local government. He was strong proponent of the Lyttelton road tunnel, and of the Christchurch International Airport. He chaired the Airport Committee at the time of the opening of the new terminal building in 1960. Ron Guthrey Road near the airport is named in commemoration of his influence on the airport's development. He championed the opening up of Hagley Park through the Armagh Street bridge and supported the development of the Botanic Gardens car park, and implemented the \\"toast rack\\" (an electrically powered cart with commentary for Botanic Gardens tours). He was responsible for the motorway development (Brougham Street), the first flyover (at the Colombo Street-Moorhouse Avenue intersection), the first parking building, the saving of Mona Vale as a public park for the citizens, and the beginning of local body amalgamation. He was also responsible for the introduction of the one-way street system. Controversies Guthrey is remembered for two main controversies. The major controversy is the \\"road through the park proposal\\", which would have seen Harper Avenue diverted to connect with Salisbury Street through North Hagley Park. Work on the deviation began in 1970. The outcry from opponents to the scheme and the 1971 local body election result put a stop to the work. Guthrey lost the mayoralty to Neville Pickering, who stopped the works. Peter Skellerup, a Christchurch City Councillor from 1958 to 1980, was parks and recreation chairman at that time. Skellerup fought against the scheme and took great satisfaction from his victory in this battle. The other controversy occurred when he removed a placard from the Cenotaph monument in Cathedral Square on Anzac Day, 1970. It had been placed by the Progressive Youth Movement, and read \\"to the victims of fascism\\". He condemned the act as an insult to the war dead. Life outside politics After having lost a leg in the war, he returned to New Zealand and continued to play sports (tennis and golf). An article in the Christchurch Press described him as a \\"go-getter from way back\\" with \\"a list of accomplishments that fill a book\\". The Guthrey family is a well-known Christchurch family, having established Guthrey Travel and Guthrey Coachlines, among other businesses. Established in 2001, Paralympics New Zealand recognises individuals who have given outstanding service to the organisation and Paralympic sport by awarding them a Paralympics New Zealand Order of Merit, which Guthrey honoured in the inaugural year for his contribution of service to the Paralympic movement, replacing his life membership. He was a vice president and a Foundation Representative of the Finance Committee of the New Zealand Paraplegic & Physically Disabled Federation from 1978 to 1986. On 8 September 2008, Ron Guthrey and his wife Mary died within 90 minutes of each other. Mary Guthrey had been sick for some time and died at 8:45 pm Ron Guthrey died at 10:15 pm, only 5 minutes after having been told that his wife had died. Their son Peter Guthrey described them as a very close couple: \\"They just lived for each other. Mum had a stroke some time ago and I think dad was just hanging in there for her. When she went it was like dad decided it was time to go too.\\" Son of Ron is John Guthrey, famously known for his outspoken character, and his controversial cardboard coffins.

The workers click the links, surf the target website for a period of time, and possibly sign up for newsletters prior to clicking another link. For many of these workers, clicking on enough ads per day may increase their revenue substantially and may also be an alternative to other types of work. It is extremely difficult for an automated filter to detect this simulated traffic as fake because the visitor behavior appears exactly the same as that of an actual legitimate visitor. Fake likes generating from click farms are essentially different from those arising from bots where computer programs are written by software experts. To deal with such issues, companies such as Facebook are trying to create algorithms that seek to wipe out accounts with unusual activity (e.g. liking too many pages in a short period of time).  Logistics  Click farms are usually located in developing countries, such as China, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. The business of click farms extends to generating likes and followers on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and more. Workers are paid, on average, one US dollar for a thousand likes or for following a thousand people on Twitter. Then click farms turn around and sell their likes and followers at a much higher price. According to the Daily Mail, \\"BuyPlusFollowers sells 250 Google+ shares for $12.95; InstagramEngine sells 1,000 Instagram followers for $12.00; and AuthenticHits sells 1,000 SoundCloud plays for $9.00.\\" In Thailand in June 2017, a click farm was discovered with hundreds of mobile phones and several hundred thousand SIM cards used to build up likes and views on WeChat.http://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/click-farm- raided-347200-sims-found/news-story/efb45fa8689f0a84c5a8626ea987a1f1 There are two methods to click farming. The first is by hiring competitor fraudsters to deplete the advertising budget of the competitor so that they will be able to have their ads shown in higher pay-per-click rankings at a lower cost. In this case, the competitor is weakened instead of being outbid in the pay-per-click bidding system. The investment on the click farm made by the fraudster is only a very small fraction of the amount lost by the competitor. The second is by hiring the click farm workers to click on ads on the click farmer's own site. This way, the money lost by the advertisers is gained by the click farmer, rather than by the search engines and content networks as in the first method. The need for click farming arises because, as The Guardian states, \\"31% will check ratings and reviews, including likes and Twitter followers, before they choose to buy something.\\" This shows the increasing importance that businesses, celebrities and other organisations put on the number of likes and followers they have. This creates monetary values for likes and followers which means that businesses and celebrities feel compelled to increase their likes to create a positive online profile. Pay-per-click providers, including Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, have made substantial efforts to combat click fraud. Automated filters remove most click fraud attempts at the source. Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-based Google, said that ‚Äúwe design our systems to catch bot-related attacks.‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause a significant amount of malicious traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds of attacks.‚Äù she added. In an effort to circumvent these filtering systems, click fraudsters have begun to use these click farms to mimic actual visitors.  Implications Engagement rate, a performance metric that measures the quality of social media activity such as Facebook likes or Twitter retweets, can be interpreted in terms of \\"engagement per follower,\\" measured by dividing the raw counts of social media activity by the number of followers. Users who engage in short term click farms services will see their engagement rate plummet in time as the initial increase in the volume of social media activity drops when the click farms services end, coupled with the increase in fake followers if not the same. Italian security researchers and bloggers Andrea Stroppa and Carla De Micheli found out in 2013 that $40 million to $360 million to date were earned from the sale of and the potential benefits of buying fake Twitter followers. $200 million a year is also earned from fake Facebook activities. About 40 to 80 percent of Facebook advertisements are bought on a pay-per-click basis. Advertisers have claimed that about 20 percent of Facebook clicks are invalid and they had tried to seek refunds. This could cost Facebook $2.5 billion of their 2014 revenue. Some companies have tried to mitigate the effects of click farming. Coca-Cola made its 2010 Super Bowl advert \\"Hard Times\\" private after learning it was shared on Shareyt and issued a statement that it \\"did not approve of fake fans.\\" Hasbro was alerted to an online casino, a sub-licensee of its Monopoly brand had added fake Facebook likes and hence contacted Facebook to remove the site. Hasbro issued a statement that it was ‚Äúappalled to hear of what had occurred‚Äù and claimed no previous knowledge of the page. Although click farm services violate many social media user policies, there are no government regulations that render them illegal. However, Sam DeSilva, a lawyer specializing in IT and outsourcing law at Manches LLP in Oxford had mentioned that: \\"Potentially, a number of laws are being breached ‚Äì the consumer protection and unfair trading regulations. Effectively it's misleading the individual consumers.\\"  Advertising provider responses  Facebook issued a statement stating: \\"A like that doesn't come from someone truly interested in connecting with the brand benefits no one. If you run a Facebook page and someone offers you a boost in your fan count in return for money, our advice is to walk away ‚Äì not least because it is against our rules and there is a good chance those likes will be deleted by our automatic systems. We investigate and monitor \\"like-vendors\\" and if we find that they are selling fake likes, or generating conversations from fake profiles, we will quickly block them from our platform.\\" Andrea Faville reported that Alphabet Inc. companies, Google and YouTube, \\"take action against bad actors that seek to game our systems.\\" LinkedIn spokesman Doug Madey said buying connections \\"dilutes the member experience violates their user agreement and can also prompt account closures.\\" Chief executive and founder of Instagram, Kevin Systrom reports \\"We've been deactivating spammy accounts from Instagram on an ongoing basis to improve your experience.\\" Facebook's purging of fake likes and accounts occurred from August to September 2012. According to Facebook's 2014 financial report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, an estimated 83 million false accounts were deleted, accounting for approximately 6.4% of the 1.3 billion total accounts on Facebook. Likester reported pages affected include Lady Gaga, who lost 65,505 fans and Facebook, who lost 124,919 fake likes. Technology giant Dell lost 107,889 likes (2.87% of its total likes) in 24 hours. Billions of YouTube video fake views were deleted after being exposed by auditors. In December 2014, Instagram carried out a purge deemed the \\"Instagram Rapture\\" wherein many accounts were affected‚Äîincluding Instagram's own account, which lost 18,880,211 followers.

The bill was companion legislation passed along with the Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998. Background and passage United States copyright law gives copyright owners the exclusive right to publicly perform their works.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106(4) Performance rights organizations (PROs), such as ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and Acemla, administer public performance rights for songwriters and composers, providing blanket licenses to venues allowing them to play music for their customers. Section 110(5) of the Copyright Act of 1976 exempted the need for a public performance license for music played on \\"a single receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in private homes\\" and without a \\"direct charge\\" made to listen to the performance.Copyright Act of 1976 In the years following, courts have interpreted the provision in widely divergent ways, leading to uncertainty for bar and restaurant owners who played music on their premises.Nimmer, David, Codifying Copyright Comprehensibly, 51 UCLA Law Review 1233, 1280 (2004). Many restaurant and bar owners also complained about \\"disruptive\\" and \\"coercive\\" tactics employed by field agents of the PRO's investigating unlicensed establishments.See \\"Oversight Hearing on Fairness in Music Licensing, Before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property of the House Judiciary Committee, 105th Congress, 1st Session (July 17, 1997) As a result, the National Restaurant Association, the National Licensed Beverage Association, and similar interest groups began lobbying for a more favorable exemption in the early 1990s.ASCAP - Legislative Timeline Their legislative attempts were strongly opposed by the PRO's, who argued that music played in bars and restaurants draws customers in and songwriters deserve to be compensated for the use of their works in this manner.Music Licensing in Restaurants and Retail and Other Establishments, Before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property of the House Judiciary Committee, 105th Congress, July 17, 1997 Despite the opposition, the bill was ultimately successful, after having been attached as an amendment to the Copyright Term Extension Act, and was signed into law on October 27, 1998. The new provision kept the 'homestyle' exemption of the original provision but added specific exemptions based on the type of establishment, size of establishment, and type of equipment used to play music. Several studies have concluded that the Act exempts around 70% of eating and drinking establishments.Graeme B. Dinwoodie, The Development and Incorporation of International Norms in the Formation of Copyright Law, 62 Ohio State Law Journal 733, 752 (2001). WTO Dispute Shortly after the bill went into effect, the European Communities began dispute proceedings against the United States in front of the World Trade Organization, claiming the new exemption violated the Berne Convention's protection of an author's exclusive public performance right. On July 27, 2000, the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body sided with the EC and held that the exemption violated Articles 11bis(1)(iii) and 11(1)(ii) of the Berne Convention (1971) as incorporated into the TRIPS Agreement by Article 9.1. The US and EC announced a temporary settlement arrangement on June 23, 2003, though the Fairness in Music Licensing Act remains in effect.http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds160_e.htm Under the Temporary Settlement, effective June 23, 2003 through December 20, 2004, the US paid $3.3 million to a fund established in the EU for the benefit of rights-holders. As of May 7, 2010, the US continues to file required status reports with the WTO stating that \\"The US Administration is working closely with the US Congress and will continue to confer with the European Communities in order to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.\\" References Category:United States federal copyright legislation Category:Acts of the 105th United States Congress ","title":"Fairness in Music Licensing Act of 1998"},{"id":"26094371","text":"Game Over II (known as Phantis in Spain) is an action game developed and published by Dinamic Software in 1987 for the ZX Spectrum, MSX, MS-DOS, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Atari ST. Gameplay Game Over II is a mix between a scrolling shoot 'em up game (similar to R-Type) and a platform game (similar to Turrican). There are four \\"phases\\" with six levels each. Some versions of the game were split into two parts due to size restrictions. Plot In the original Spanish version (Phantis), the player controls Commander Serena on a mission to rescue her expedition partner captured on Moon 4 of the SOTPOK System, better known as the world of Phantis. The English-language version (Game Over II) takes place immediately after the events of Game Over, where Arkos, the hero of the rebellion, is nowhere to be found. After it has been discovered that he has been imprisoned on the jail planet Phantis by the heirs of the empress Gremla, Major Locke is chosen for the rescue mission. Other than the graphical change of a female player character to a male player character, the game itself is largely identical in both versions. Release Although originally released as an independent game under the title Phantis, it was retitled as a sequel to Game Over. The Atari ST version was never published in Spain and only exists with the Game Over II title. The game's promotion included an appearance of a model dressed up as Queen Gremla at the trade convention PC Show '88. Reception The game was given generally mediocre reviews. It received the scores of 69% from Amstrad Action, 55% from Commodore User, 60-63% from The Games Machine, and 62% from Sinclair User. Amstrad Computer User gave it a 17/20. Legacy A spiritual successor to Phantis featuring a modern take of the characters and setting, titled Ultionus: A Tale of Petty Revenge, was released in 2014.

Early life Benjamin Wade grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of William and Cherri Wade. He attended Tyson Middle School and West High School in Knoxville. He began his musical career as a teenager, playing in the Knoxville Youth Symphony Orchestra and making appearances with the Indianapolis Symphony, the Knoxville Symphony, and the New York Metropolitan Opera. He majored in business administration at the University of Tennessee and graduated in 1993, before obtaining a master's degree in Music Education from the University of Nevada. Soccer In 1997, Wade was hired at Simpson University in Redding, California, to coach the women's soccer team. He then spent 13 years coaching collegiate soccer teams and ended up at Southwest Baptist University from 2005\\"Transactions\\", The New York Times, April 14, 2005. to 2009. After his appearance on Survivor, Wade was fired as head women's soccer coach for the university. The university's athletic director Brent Good had fired Wade for not telling the school that he would be taking two months off in order to participate in Survivor. Good stated in an interview, \\"He [Wade] said he was going to be gone for a week...the week went beyond that, which went beyond that, which went beyond that.\\" According to Good, Wade left the team with two weeks left in the season in October but did not return to the school until December. In 2010, he signed a contract to coach the men's soccer team at Lassen College, a community college located in Susanville.\\"Ben Wade to coach Lassen College men's soccer team\\", Lassen County Times, May 4, 2010. On December 10, 2013, Wade was hired as the first ever men's soccer head coach at Lake Tahoe Community College. After 20 years of coaching collegiate soccer he retired from that position in November 2015, to spend more time with his family. Wade has come out of retirement to take over the reins of the Redding Royals FC semi-pro soccer team, starting with the 2017 season.http://www.redding.com/story/sports/local/2016/11/25/area-roundup- redding-royals-fc-enter-season-with-new-coach/94466752 Music Ben Wade conducting symphony orchestra Wade was hired on with the Susanville Symphony in 2003. His main instrument was the trumpet. He has composed several classical music pieces and is the co-founder and current artistic director and conductor of the Susanville Symphony. In 2011, his ballet The Four Elements premiered. A documentary featuring the accomplishments of this organization is chronicled in Small Town Big Symphony, filmed by his brother Peter in 2006. Wade was also a teacher of music history at Lassen College. Survivor Tocantins Wade was selected to participate on Survivor: Tocantins, the 18th season of the series, in 2009. Being one of the most controversial characters to ever play the game, he was recognized as the main antagonist of this season; however, Jeff Probst has stated he doesn't feel like Wade did anything to earn this reputation. While in the game, he gave nicknames to his fellow tribemates: James \\"J.T.\\" Thomas, Jr., the \\"warrior\\", Stephen Fishbach, the \\"wizard\\", Tyson Apostol, the \\"assistant coach\\" (to which Apostol later wished to upgrade himself to \\"co-coach\\"), and himself, the \\"Dragon Slayer\\". These players together formed the \\"Warrior Alliance\\". Ultimately he made it to a fifth-place finish, and was the fifth member of the jury, as well, voting for Thomas to win the title of Sole Survivor. Wade was perhaps most famous for telling his fellow castaways stories of adventure from his previous exploits as a professional kayaker. Such stories were chronicled in the book A Voyage Beyond Reason, written by Tom Gauthier, although many of these stories were revealed to have a rather casual relationship with reality. Heroes vs. Villains For the 20th season of the series, CBS brought back \\"heroes\\" and \\"villains\\" from previous seasons. Wade was selected to participate for the Villains tribe and was the ninth person voted off and the first member of the jury. During his time in the game, he was a part of the Villains majority alliance and had a close alliance and relationship with fellow Villain Jerri Manthey, leading some to believe that the two had a possible romantic connection. He appeared to be in the majority alliance on his tribe at the time of his elimination, but outsiders Sandra Diaz-Twine, who would be the eventual winner, and Courtney Yates managed to convince the alliance that he was not trustworthy, and he was sent to the jury in lieu of Yates. At the reunion, Wade mentioned that after watching this season and Tocantins, he realized how people viewed him, and decided that he did not want to be viewed as \\"The Dragon Slayer\\" anymore. South Pacific In 2011, Wade returned to Survivor for the third time in Survivor: South Pacific, as the self-styled 'Zen Slayer' and one of two returning contestants (the other being Ozzy Lusth). During the season, Wade was assigned to the Upolu tribe through random draw, gaining the friendship of Edna Ma on the first day. On the first night, he made an alliance with Sophie Clarke, Rick Nelson, Albert Destrade, and Brandon Hantz, who later revealed to Wade that he was Russell Hantz's nephew. Wade decided to trust Brandon Hantz, but still was wary of his outbursts. Wade and his four alliance members eliminated Christine Shields-Markoski, Stacey Powell and Mikayla Wingle, sending them all to Redemption Island. At camp, Wade found the Hidden Immunity Idol with the help of Destrade and Clarke, keeping it a secret from Hantz and Ma. Later on, Wade staged the Idol's \\"discovery\\" for Hantz, under the guise of a prayer ritual. The tribes merged with six members each, prompting Wade to attempt to sway former Savaii member John Cochran over in order to avoid a tie. Wade's alliance, now including Cochran, voted off the remaining Savaiis. Both Cochran and Ma, knowing that they were on the outside of the alliance, tried to get Wade to betray his original alliance; however, he decided against it. He went on to vote off Cochran first, followed by Ma. Wade, Clarke and Destrade ended up in the Final Three, and Wade finished second place only to Clarke, who won in a 6‚Äì3‚Äì0 vote.  Post-Survivor  Coach Wade was inducted to the Survivor Hall of Fame in 2015. In September 2020, Coach Wade was ranked the \\"20th Greatest Survivor\\" by former castaway Russell Hantz. Personal life Wade married Jessica Newton, a dance studio owner, on December 31, 2011. Together, they have two children, daughter Lenna (born May 8, 2014) and Bekston (born October 13, 2016), and one more child from Newton's previous relationship, Avvan (born February 28, 2009).

November 15, 2016. in what are now defined as southeastern Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeastern Texas. They are considered to be one of the main ancestral groups of the Caddoan Mississippian culture, along with the contemporaneous Mill Creek culture of eastern Texas. This culture was named for the Fourche Maline Creek, a tributary of the Poteau River. Their modern descendants are the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. Description Fourche Maline culture gorgets and bannerstones In the late 1930s archeologists with the federal Work Projects Administration excavated a series of sites in the Wister Valley of southeastern Oklahoma. The middens at these sites were unusually thick and dark, and were called \\"black mounds\\" by the excavators. They contained a blend of Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian culture artifacts. These sites became the type sites for the Fourche Maline culture. Early during this time period, ceramic pottery had been introduced into the area, probably from Tchefuncte culture peoples to the southeast in Louisiana. The population became more sedentary and began to establish semi-permanent villages and to practice agriculture, planting various cultigens of the Eastern Agricultural Complex, including maize. The populations began to expand, and trade with various non-local peoples also began to increase. Trade with peoples to the southwest brought the bow and arrow.(citation needed, former citation doesn't contain that info) Trade with the Marksville culture and other Hopewellian peoples brought exotic goods from the Gulf Coast such as fresh water pearls, sea shells, sharks' teeth, and copper from northern areas. An increase in the hierarchical structuring of the Fourche Maline society also began during this period; researchers have not determined if it arose independently or was influenced by Hopewell culture. The dead were cared for in increasingly elaborate rituals, as the first burial mounds were built at this time. Political power began to be consolidated, and the elite organized the construction of the first earthwork platform mounds at ritual centers. They were used for ceremonies and sometimes residences by the developing hereditary political and religious leadership. Archeological excavations at McCutcheon- McLaughlin site in Latimer County, Oklahoma in the mid 1970s revealed many details about the lives and deaths of the Fourche Maline people. They were more healthy when eating the nuts, seeds, tubers, fish and game of their hunting-gathering period than were their descendants, who depended on maize cultivation. Also, degenerative diseases such as arthritis were less frequent. But, their lives were difficult. The most often identified cause of death among the burials excavated, was warfare. Researchers found several mass graves; the bodies were injured by projectile points. One specific group of nine, mostly women and children, was found showing assault by a type of chert projectile point foreign to the area. This foreign material, from the Springfield plateau of southwest Missouri and northern Arkansas, was not available to the Fourche Maline people for their own points. Archaeologists believe that a raiding party from that area may have surprised and attacked the Fourche Maline group when their warriors were away. The survivors buried their dead in a single mass grave. It is uncertain whether the people who occupied these sites were permanent or temporary residents, but they definitely influenced later inhabitants of the Arkansas and Red River Valleys and throughout present-day Eastern Oklahoma.\\"Fourche Maline Focus.\\"Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed November 15, 2016. Pottery Fourche Maline pottery was tempered with grog, bone, grit, and sand. Believed to have been made by the women, it is known for its distinct shape, mainly flat-based vessels with thick walls, similar to flower pots. Common varieties found in archaeological sites are Williams plain, Cooper Boneware and Ouachita plain. Notes See also * Hopewell tradition References External links * Robert E.

Born in Christchurch, Thornton joined the Royal New Zealand Artillery in 1937. He served throughout the Second World War in a number of artillery and staff posts. Shortly after the war, he was appointed the commander of the artillery of the 2nd New Zealand Division. After holding a series of senior posts in the New Zealand Army, including a period as its commander, he was appointed Chief of the Defence Staff in 1965 for a six-year term. Knighted in 1967, he was later the New Zealand ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam. He died in 1999 at the age of 82. Early life Leonard Thornton was born in Christchurch on 15 October 1916 and received his education at Christchurch Boys' High School. At the age of 17, he was awarded a scholarship to the Royal Military College in Duntroon, Australia. He was one of four cadets from New Zealand, the first intake from this country to enter Duntroon since 1921. A good student, he was also an accomplished athlete, participating in several sports. When he graduated from Duntroon, he was awarded the King's Medal for academic excellence for finishing first in his class. Military career Second World War Thornton was commissioned in the Royal New Zealand Artillery in December 1937 as a lieutenant. After a period of further training in Australia on coastal artillery, he was posted to Wellington as an instructor. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, he was posted to 5th Field Regiment, the second of the artillery regiments to be raised for service abroad with the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), as its adjutant. The regiment was attached to the 4th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd New Zealand Division. However, he was later transferred to 25 Battery, 4th Field Regiment, as a battery captain. The 2nd New Zealand Division was to be formed in three echelons, which would assemble in Egypt. Thornton embarked with the first echelon on 6 January 1940 which arrived in Egypt at Maadi Camp, the main 2NZEF base in the Middle East, on 11 February. He led 25 Battery during the Battle of Greece, which helped cover the Allied retreats at Platamon and Tempe before it was evacuated to the island of Crete. His battery, having lost its guns, fought as infantry during the subsequent Battle of Crete after which it was transported to Egypt. Here he took command of 43 Anti-Aircraft Battery. In February 1942, as the division was re-organised in Egypt and Syria following its losses in Operation Crusader, Thornton was made brigade major of the 6th Infantry Brigade and in May married Wellington VAD Janet Sloman in Haifa. Thornton returned to the artillery in September 1942 as second-in-command of 4th Field Regiment, but the following month he was posted to the staff of the division. Here he came to the attention of its commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg, for the quality of his operational work.In June 1943, Thornton, promoted to lieutenant colonel, was given command of 5th Field Regiment. By now, the conflict in North Africa was over with the surrender of the Afrika Korps, and the New Zealanders were transferred to Italy to participate in the campaign there. When the New Zealand Corps was established for the Battle of Monte Cassino in March 1944, Thornton was made General Staff Officer of the 2nd New Zealand Division. Although he returned to command of the 5th Field Regiment after the dissolution of the New Zealand Corps, Freyberg brought him back to the divisional staff as its senior operations officer. Shortly after the war ended in Europe, he was promoted to brigadier, the youngest in the 2NZEF at the time, and appointed commander of the divisional artillery. For his services in the war, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and had also twice been mentioned in despatches. Postwar career After the war, Thornton performed occupation duties with Jayforce, in Japan, where he was the Senior British Liaison Officer in the Tokyo sub-area. He returned to New Zealand in July 1946 to serve as a staff officer at Army Headquarters. In 1948 he commenced a two- year term as Deputy Chief of Staff and during this time he worked towards the implementation of a compulsory military training scheme for the Territorial Force, which commenced in May 1950. He was dispatched to England in 1952 to attend the Imperial Defence College after which he led the New Zealand Joint Services Liaison Staff in London. During this time, in which New Zealand's military affairs were dominated by the country's involvement in the Korean War, Thornton began to demonstrate the diplomatic skills that would prove useful during his later career. In 1955, Thornton returned to New Zealand to serve as the Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Army, and this was followed as a term from 1956 to 1958 as its Adjutant General. In the 1957 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. New Zealand had become a member of the South East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in 1955, and in July 1958 Thornton moved to Bangkok, where he served as head of the Military Planning Office of SEATO. In this capacity, he gained valuable insight in the scenarios in which New Zealand's military might be expected to play a part. The following year he was promoted to acting major general and appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the youngest ever to serve in this role which was effectively the commander of the New Zealand Army. This was to prove a challenging term for Thornton for, driven by the Labour Government, there was a significant change in New Zealand defence policy. Since the Second World War, defence planning had been based around the concept of an infantry division being raised largely from the Territorial Force. This had now changed to a self-sufficient brigade-sized force made up of a combination of Regular and Territorial Force personnel. While not a policy Thornton personally agreed with, he oversaw the reorganisation that was required to achieve the desired structure and this saw some longstanding regiments being amalgamated. In the 1962 New Year Honours, part way through his term as CGS, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In 1965, the independence of the New Zealand Army from the other armed services was ended, and the New Zealand Defence Force, combining the army, navy and airforce, was established. Thornton was the second Chief of Defence Staff, succeeding Vice Admiral Sir Peter Phipps, and went on to complete a six-year term in this capacity, after which he retired from the army in the rank of lieutenant general. He had been made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1967 Queen's Birthday Honours. Later life Thornton was appointed as New Zealand's ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam in 1972 and during this time, he also represented the country's affairs in Cambodia. Despite his retirement as a diplomat in 1974, Thornton maintained a relatively high profile in the public sector. Until 1983, he served as the chair of the Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council and often commented on defence issues, particularly on New Zealand's anti-nuclear stance as well as the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty. At one stage, he was criticised by the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, David Lange, for his views. He also presented several documentaries on various aspects of New Zealand's military history. He died on 10 June 1999 at the age of 82.

The galaxy is located at the distance of about 150 kpc from the Sun and moves towards the Sun with the velocity of about 130 km/s. It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) meaning that it has an elliptical (ratio of axes ~ 2:1) shape with the half-light radius of about . CVn II is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the Milky Way‚Äîits integrated luminosity is about 8,000 times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about ‚àí4.9), which is much lower than the luminosity of a typical globular cluster. However, its mass is about 2.5 million solar masses, which means that galaxy's mass to light ratio is around 340. A high mass to light ratio implies that CVn II is dominated by the dark matter. The stellar population of CVn II consists mainly of old stars formed more than 12 billion years ago. The metallicity of these old stars is also very low at , which means that they contain 150 times less heavy elements than the Sun.

Health insurers determine what they deem to be \\"usual, customary and reasonable\\" and pay only a percentage of that.Sarah Max The fuzzy math of health insurance. When an insurer's idea of usual, reasonable and customary comes up short, you're stuck paying. Money CNN, 30 August 2005, accessed 28 November 2015 Under an early version of this system based on Resource-Based Relative Value Units, physician services were largely considered to be misvalued, with evaluation and management services being undervalued and procedures overvalued. Third-party payers (public and private health insurance) advocated for an improved model instead of the UCR fees that led to \\"some egregious distortions\\". In the mid-1980s, U.S. health care \\"payments for doing procedures had far outstripped payments for diagnosis\\". For example, \\"doctors who spent an hour making a complex and lifesaving diagnosis were paid forty dollars; for spending an hour doing a colonoscopy and excising a polyp, they received more than six hundred dollars\\". Costs for cataract surgery, which could be as high as $6,000 in 1985, \\"grew to consume 4% of Medicare's budget\\". And despite technology that reduced the time required for the surgery by a factor of 4 to 6, costs did not decrease. The US government healthcare website defines usual, customary and reasonable as being \\"The amount paid for a medical service in a geographic area based on what providers in the area usually charge for the same or similar medical service. The UCR amount sometimes is used to determine the allowed amount.\\" Often it is used by insurance companies and plan administrators when participants go out of network for services where typically the maximum the plan will pay for a claim is based on the prevailing rates in the area or UCR.

Such a motor is theoretically as well as practically not realizable. The idea of functioning magnetic motors has been promoted by various hobbyists. It can be regarded as parascience. There are frequent references to free energy and sometimes even links to esotericism. Magnet motors are not to be confused with the commonly used permanent magnet motors, which are powered from an external electrical energy supply.  Working principle  Example of a magnet motor design. The predominantly attracting orientation of the magnets apparently leads to a perpetual rotary motion. A hypothetical magnet motor works with permanent magnets in stator and rotor. By a special arrangement of the attracting and repelling poles, a rotational movement of the rotor is supposedly permanently maintained. Practical implementations fail because there is no substantial energy in magnets that could be employed for propulsion or to compensate for energy losses. The force between permanent magnets is conservative as the magnetic field follows a potential, so that there is no work done over a closed cycle. After a short amount of time, such a motor will stop moving and assume an equilibrium position. Rationalizations of proponents about the nature of the energy source vary. Some argue with magnetic force only, leaving questions of conservation of energy aside. Some argue that permanent magnets contain stored magnetic energy, which will be consumed by the motor. Such energy that exists is limited to the energy spent during the production of the magnet, which is rather small. Also, this would lead to a rapid reduction of the magnetization over time, which is not observed. Other rationalizations include references to so-called free energy and zero-point energy, without explaining how these energies are liberated. Others claim that their motors could possibly convert heat energy from the environment to mechanical motion (perpetual motion machine of the second kind).  History  Fist ideas of a magnetic motor are attributed to Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt from 1269. A popular example of a magnet motor, although without rotating axis, was put forward by John Wilkins in 1670: A ramp with a magnet at the top, which pulled a metal ball up the ramp. Near the magnet was a small hole that was supposed to allow the ball to drop under the ramp and return to the bottom, where a flap allowed it to return to the top again. The complete theory of electromagnetism was only formulated by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865, and has been found valid up until today. Patent sketch of Howard Johnson's magnet motor Since the middle of the 20th century, a number of inventors claimed to have constructed various magnet motors. In 1954, German mechanical engineer Friedrich L√ºling claimed to have realized a motor which could run with its permanent magnets for 10 to 20 years without interruption. On 8 February 1966, the UFA-Wochenschau reported on the invention.Wochenschau 498 American engineer Howard Johnson filed the on a permanent magnet motor in 1973, which was granted in 1979. A prototype of his motor was presented in 1980 in the popular scientific Science & Mechanics Magazine. Further magnet motors were designed by the Japanese entertainer Kohei Minato, who applied for patents in 1988, 1997 and 2005. The European Patent Office has not recognized a patent application for a magnet motor. Starting in 2006, ‚Äúinventor‚Äù Mike Brady and his company Perendev-Group marketed such a motor and was charged with serious fraud in 2010 and sentenced to 5 years and 9 months imprisonment. In para-scientific circles, the magnet motor is still propagated and construction manuals are still distributed despite the lacking proof of function. In the beginning of the 21st century, the idea of a magnet motor has been increasingly propagated on the internet and a number of fake videos showing pretended running magnet motors have appeared on online video-sharing platforms.For example, ‚ÄúCreative Think‚Äù on YouTube shows a number of fake magnet motors, some of which are easily recognizable as externally driven. Addressing the question, why the magnet motor is still not adopted by the industry, despite its supposedly great potential, conspiracy theories are put forward: Magnet motors would provide free energy for everyone, harm the existing energy industry, and would thus be suppressed.

Geography The county was located on both sides of the upper Aller river in present-day Saxony-Anhalt. It was bounded by the Lappwald hill range and the Dr√∂mling swamp in the northwest, the River Bode in the southwest, and the Elbe and Saale Rivers in the east, where it bordered on the lands settled by the Polabian Slavs. Towns included the Imperial residence of Magdeburg as well as Haldensleben, Oschersleben, and Calbe. Neighboring Saxon counties were Osterwalde and Balsamgau in the north, Derlingau in the west, as well as Harzgau and Schwabengau in the south. Beyond Elbe and Saale it bordered on the Morazena, Ciervisti and Serimunt counties, administrative parts of the vast marca Geronis from 937. History The Saxon count Christian, probably a scion of the Billung dynasty, was mentioned in the Nordth√ºringgau about 937. He also ruled in the adjacent Schwabengau and upon the implementation of the marca Geronis in from 945 also over the adjacent Serimunt region beyond the Elbe River, being the brother-in-law of Margrave Gero. Upon his death in 950 he was succeeded by his son Count Thietmar (d. 979), who after the exile of Gunther of Merseburg was appointed Margrave of Meissen in 976. Count Christian' s grandson Gero II (d. 1015) was not able to retain Meissen, but in 993 succeeded his uncle Odo as margrave of the Saxon Eastern March. The last count in the Nordth√ºringgau from the Billung dynasty was Thietmar II, Margrave of the Saxon Eastern March from 1015 to 1030. Upon his death, Schwabengau, Harzgau and Nordth√ºringgau as well as Serimunt were enfeoffed to Esico of Ballenstedt, a maternal grandson of Margrave Odo. Esico became the progenitor of the House of Ascania and his lands over the following generations evolved into the state of Anhalt. After the deposition of the Saxon duke Henry the Lion in 1180, the lands of the former Nordth√ºringgau were replaced by the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, the Bishopric of Halberstadt and the Altmark territory of Brandenburg.

Plot  During a performance tour in Germany, Anis Ferchichi (Bushido) celebrates his birthday with his crew on the tour bus. Ferchichi gets a letter from his father. This brings back memories of his difficult childhood in Berlin which are then shown through flashbacks. Ferchichi spends his childhood in a deprived area of Berlin with his Tunisian father, German mother, and younger brother Sercan. He grows up in a violent environment and often watches his father beating his mother. He is a poor student, but embraces music. He goes to college and leaves his girlfriend after she has been unfaithful to him. He earns a lot of money selling drugs and celebrates his success as a drug dealer at a party, where he meets Selina, who becomes his new girlfriend. One day, drug dealers break into the apartment Ferchichi shares with his family, tie up his mother and his brother Sercan, ransack their possessions and steal their money. After this experience, Ferchichi spends more time with his friends. Years later, Ferchichi, now an adult, starts freestyle rapping with his friends, including Patrick Losensky (Fler).

Proposed in 1969 by Martin Goldstein, JG Œ≤-relaxation were described as a secondary relaxation mechanism required to explain the viscosity behavior of liquids approaching the glass transition in the potential energy landscape picture presented in Goldstein's seminal 1969 paper. Previous experiments on glass forming liquids showed multiple relaxation times present in liquids measured by time dependent compliance measurements. Gyan P. Johari and Martin Goldstein measured the dielectric loss spectrum of a set of rigid glass forming molecules to further test the hypothesis of Goldstein in 1969. The relaxation, a peak in mechanical or dielectric loss at a particular frequency, had previously been attributed to a type of molecular flexibility [citation needed]. The fact that such a loss peak shows up in glasses of rigid molecules lacking this flexibility demonstrated its universal character. The JG Œ≤-relaxation process is speculated to be a precursor of the structural Œ±-relaxation, i.e., its occurrence facilitates viscous flow, however the microscopic mechanism of the Œ≤-relaxation has not been definitively identified.  Evidence for the universality and importance of the J. G. Œ≤-relaxation  Jahori determined the temperature dependence of the Œ±-relaxation and Œ≤-relaxation as a function of frequency by measuring the dielectric loss Œµ‚Ä≥ as a function of frequency at multiple temperatures. They observed two peaks in the system with the lower frequency peak attributed to the structural Œ±-relaxation and the higher frequency peak related to the fast (high frequency short time) Œ≤-relaxation. The peak in the high frequency Œµ‚Ä≥ response of the Œ≤-relaxation has also been shown to broaden and shift to lower frequencies. Furthermore, the Œ±-relaxation peak changes more rapidly on cooling than the rate of JG Œ≤-relaxation, where the Œ±-relaxation times diverge following the VFT law as Tg is approached which is much faster than the arrhenious temperature dependence observed for the peak in the Œ≤-relaxation curve over the same temperature ranges.  Relation to other relaxation mechanism  The J.G. Œ≤-relaxation was developed based on the theoretical predictions of Martin Goldstein in his seminal 1969 paper discussing the potential energy landscape picture and activated energy barrier hopping for viscous liquids. These developments have often focused on understanding secondary relaxations below Tg that are present in small molecule and metallic glasses. Polymer glasses also show multiple relaxation mechanisms at temperatures below Tg, with Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥ and delta relaxations having been measured well below Tg into the glassy state. However, the exact molecular mechanism for these relaxations is often subject to debate and how they may relate to J. G Œ≤-relaxations is not established by the literature.

It was built in 1816 at Salem, MA by shipbuilder Retire Becket for owner George Crowninshield, Jr. Crowninshield died in 1817 after a single pleasure voyage to the Mediterranean; his brother Richard bought it, used it for two coastal trading voyages, and then sold it to Boston China traders Bryant & Sturgis and Capt. John Suter in early 1820. Suter sailed it to Hawai'i and sold it to Hawaiian monarch Kamehameha II (aka Liloliho) for slightly more than a million pounds of sandalwood. Liholiho used it as his private yacht, renaming it Haaheo o Hawaii (\\"Pride of Hawaii\\") in 1822 after a rebuild. Under an all-Hawaiian crew, Ha'aheo wrecked in Hanalei Bay, Kaua'i, Hawai'i in April 1824. Building In the 18th century the Crowninshield family of Salem, Massachusetts had a thriving shipping business. In the American Revolution and War of 1812, many of the family merchant vessels were converted to privateers, and the family made huge fortunes. The elder George Crowninshield (born in 1733) died in 1815, and his five sons inherited the business. Eldest son George Crowninshield Jr. (1766‚Äì1817) commissioned a pleasure yacht originally called the ship Car of Concordia. At registration he renamed it Cleopatra's Barge for the pleasure barge of Egyptian Queen Cleopatra VII, based on a passage in the play Antony and Cleopatra. It was built by Retire Becket of SalemRetire Beckett House Retire Beckett brief biography and launched October 21, 1816. At a time when all American ships were either merchant or naval vessels, the concept of a pleasure yacht was unique. Cleopatra's Barge was 83 feet (25.3 m) long at the waterline, wide and measured 192 tons. It had two masts in the configuration known as a hermaphrodite brig: square-rigged forward and schooner-rigged aft. This made it fast but required a relatively small crew. It cost about US$50,000 to build, and about the same amount was spent for fitting out and luxury furnishings. The main cabin was by , with mahogany panels inlaid with other decorative wood. Furniture was covered in red velvet with gold lace, and the kitchen included custom silver, china, and formal glassware. The starboard side was painted in colorful horizontal stripes, and the port side a herring- bone pattern. It even boasted indoor plumbing. On December 6, 1816, the ship was opened for public tours, and it became a popular attraction for thousands of people. After a one-day trial sail, an unusually cold winter froze the ship into dock for the winter. On January 14, 1817, the Salem Gazette reported: > \\"The elegant equipment of this vessel, by Mr. Crowninshield, for a voyage of > pleasure, as it is an entire novelty in this country, has excited universal > curiosity and admiration.\\" Atlantic Starting on March 30, 1817, it became the first American pure pleasure craft to sail across the Atlantic. The owner's brother Benjamin Williams Crowninshield was United States Secretary of the Navy, so provided letters of introduction from Secretary of State James Monroe and Ambassador to Great Britain John Quincy Adams. Adams' grandson John Quincy Adams II would later marry George Crowninshield Jr.'s grandniece. Captain Benjamin Crowninshield An older cousin Benjamin Crowninshield (1758‚Äì1836), three decks.org: Benjamin Crowninshield (1757‚Äì1836) former lieutenant of the privateer Black Watch during the American Revolution and commanding officer of the privateer Alexander during the War of 1812, was master of the ship. He brought his son Benjamin Crowninshield Jr. (1782‚Äì1864) who kept a log book including sketches and watercolors recording the journey. On a six-month cruise in the Mediterranean, large crowds of up to 8,000 individuals gathered to tour the yacht at each port. They reached Faial Island (which they called Fayal) in the Azores, April 24 where the American Consul gave a ball in their honor. Then they visited Funchal on the island of Madeira, Gibraltar, M√°laga and other ports on the southern coast of Spain. In Marseilles the ship was repainted and redecorated. Next stops were Toulon in France and Genoa in Italy where they met astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach. It was widely suspected that the Crowninshields were planning to free former Emperor Napol√©on Bonaparte from his exile on Saint Helena island back to America. There were numerous supporting episodes. On 16 August 1814, Alexander had recaptured the British prize , which the British ultimately recaptured. (They also captured Alexander.) The Crowninshields visited several of Napoleon's supporters and relatives on the island of Elba where Napol√©on had escaped in 1815. In Rome they met with Napoleon's mother Letizia Ramolino, and siblings Prince Lucien and Princess Pauline. They took on board the captain of the ship on which Napoleon escaped Elba and his doctor, along with souvenirs such as a pair of Napol√©on's boots and an imperial snuffbox. They were at various times shadowed by ships from the French, British, and American Navies, as well as pirates. Crowninshield outran them all in informal races that predate any organized yacht racing. It was also rumored he was hoping to bring back a European princess to marry, but he returned with neither wife nor Emperor. In the Harbor of Genoa, Italy After arriving back in Salem from his first cruise October 3, George Crowninshield Jr. died suddenly on November 26, 1817, aboard the ship planning his next adventure. Some of the furnishings were removed and eventually placed in the Peabody Essex Museum. The Barge was auctioned off to a Crowninshield brother for US$15,400 in July 1818 and used for a few trading voyages. Boston merchants William F. Sturgis and John Bryant bought the ship in April 1820. Although Bostonians assumed it was going to be used as a trading vessel (and it was stuffed with cargo), the owners had another plan. It sailed via South America under Captain John Suter (1781-1852) in June 1820, who had instructions to try to sell it in the Kingdom of Hawaii, then known as the \\"Sandwich Islands\\". Pacific Just before landing the ship was cleaned up and painted. Suter had been to the Hawaiian Islands on several previous trips, and as he suspected, the day after he arrived on November 6, 1820 King Kamehameha II inspected the ship and was impressed. The ancient Hawaiians had keen interest in boats, and the young king knew his father Kamehameha the Great used Western military technology such as large armed ships to conquer the islands. On November 16, 1820, the price was negotiated as 8000 piculs of sandalwood (over a million pounds), estimated to be worth about US$80,000 at the time. Kamehameha II was quite proud of his ship; in the words of Charles Bullard, the agent for Sturgis and Bryant at the time: > \\"If you want to know how Religion stands at the Islands I can tell you ‚Äî All > sects are tolerated but the King worships the Barge.\\" Various captains of the ship in Hawaii included the king's French secretary Jean-Baptiste Rives (1793‚Äì1833), known as \\"John Rives\\", Scotsman Captain Alexander Adams, Hawaiian Prime Minister Kalanimoku, and Hawaiian Naihe-Kukui Kapihe known as \\"Captain Jack\\". The yacht was equipped with cannons fired for ceremonial salutes. On its nighttime arrival to Honolulu, the noise and flashes from its blasts and the responding welcoming volleys from the fort caused an uproar of frightened people and barking dogs. An observer called it \\"a combination of the sublime and the ludicrous not soon to be forgotten\\". King Kamehameha II known as \\"Liholiho\\" In July 1821 Kamehameha II set out in a small open boat for what was thought to be a short trip near Honolulu. Instead he insisted on going to the island of Kauai across a rough open sea. The ruler of the island, Kaumualii, sent his own boat back to tell the rest of the court the king's whereabouts; the king's five wives and chiefs took the royal yacht to Kauai. For two weeks, Kamehameha toured the island while entertaining Kaumualii and the rest of the court on his yacht. On the evening of September 16, Kamehameha II suddenly ordered his crew to set sail quietly for Oahu, effectively forcing Kaumualii into exile. Russian visitors noted an African servant offering a choice of rum, brandy, gin, or wine. This might have been the same William Chapman who served as the yacht's cook for the Crowninshields, and claimed to have also worked for Captain James Cook who was killed in Hawaii in 1779. Chapman was described as an expert navigator via lunar observations. On April 18, 1822, it was discovered that much of the wood in the ship was already rotting. Some historians think that Sturgis and Bryant knew about the decay, and thus were eager for quick payment. The king threatened to stop his payments of sandalwood (he might have been running behind in his deliveries already). It was hauled out of the water and rebuilt. Captain Thomas Meek was hired to replace the rotting wood, after a trip to the Pacific Northwest to obtain lumber. Meek returned in November 1822 and worked on the ship through the Spring of 1823. It was re-launched on May 10, 1823, renamed Haaheo o Hawaii (\\"Pride of Hawaii\\"). On May 28, 1823, the royal court and missionaries William Richards and Charles Stewart sailed from Honolulu to Maui. The king seems to have given free passage for missionaries many times on the yacht between islands, which might explain why they tolerated his heavy drinking. Missionaries also enjoyed holding services on board, noting the acoustics for hymns were better than in thatched huts they otherwise used. By November 1823 Kamehameha II decided he would go to visit the King of Great Britain. Although it was suggested to use the royal yacht, a whaling ship called L'Aigle was used since the crew would be more familiar with the route. Kamehameha II died while waiting for an audience with King George IV and would never see his yacht again. On April 6, 1824, in Hanalei Bay, on the northern coast of Kauai island Haaheo o Hawaii ran the aground on a shallow reef. A recent theory for why the ship was in such a remote area was that it was on a scouting expedition, investigating plans for the rumored rebellion that would take place a few months later led by Kaumualii's son Humehume. Although this theory gives retribution for Kaumualii's capture as a motive for potential sabotage, the missionaries blamed the wreck on the frequent drunkenness of the crew. Hiram Bingham I took the opportunity to preach a sermon on temperance to the crowd gathered at the site. The Hawaiians used their bare hands to make three enormous ropes out of braids of local vegetation. They tied the cables to the main mast of the ship, and planned to roll it across the reef. While joining together in song they tugged in unison, rotating the ship back to an upright position. The mast then snapped off and the rigging fell into the sea. Before another attempt could be made, word came that Kaumualii was dying in his exile. The people of Kauai dispersed, and after salvaging any parts they could, the wreck was left to be broken up by the surf. Recovery A section of hull washed ashore on December 30, 1844, that was already damaged by shipworms, and two cannon were recovered in 1857. Several tsunamis probably helped disperse the wreckage, and the eye of hurricane Iniki passed directly over Kauai in 1992. In January 1994 Paul Forsythe Johnston of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History applied for the first underwater archaeological permits issued by the state of Hawaii to find and investigate the wreckage. Johnston was formerly a curator of the Peabody Museum. Permits were finally secured, Richard W. Rogers (known as \\"Captain Rick\\") volunteered his research vessel Pilialoha outfitted with a proton magnetometer, and in July 1995 the search began. The first season turned up mostly trash that had washed down the river that emptied into the bay. After several years of work, the ship remains were finally located, carefully excavated, and many artifacts were recovered. A section of the stern was uncovered, documented, and re-buried. An investor proposed to build a replica in 2008. It was estimated that it would take over US$7 million to construct.

In 1971 the exchange merged with the regional exchanges in other parts of Norway, and became ' (literally the Coordination of Power Stations in Norway), with 118 power companies as members as of 1988. 1991-2000: Nordic deregulation and integration In 1991 the Norwegian parliament decided to deregulate the market for power trading. In 1993 Statnett Marked AS was established as an independent company. Logotype of Nord Pool ASA (1996-2000). The company was established in 1996, spun off Nord Pool Spot AS (presently known as Nord Pool AS) in 2001 and was acquired by Nasdaq between 2007 and 2010. In 1996, the Swedish electricity market was also deregulated. Statnett Marked AS was subsequently replaced by Nord Pool ASA, owned in equal parts by the Swedish and Norwegian Transmission System Operators (TSOs), Svenska Kraftn√§t and Statnett. This contributed to the unification of the two countries' electricity markets. Finland as well as western and eastern Denmark joined Nord Pool ASA in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. 2000-present: Expansion in Europe Logotype of Nord Pool ASA (2000-2010) Logotype of Nord Pool Spot AS (2003-2016) In 2000, Nord Pool ASA participated in establishing the Leipzig Power Exchange (now part of the European Energy Exchange). Nord Pool also supplied its technology to France's Powernext exchange. On 27 December 2001, Nord Pool ASA's spot market (derivatives and physical energy markets) activities were spun off into a new company, Nord Pool Spot AS. The remaining parts of Nord Pool ASA were later acquired by Nasdaq, and are presently known as Nasdaq Commodities. In 2005, Nord Pool Spot AS started trading and clearing of European Union (EU) emission allowances, becoming the first exchange to expand its activities into this area. The company expanded its activities to Germany by opening the KONTEK bidding area. On 12 January 2010, Nord Pool Spot AS in cooperation with Nasdaq Commodities launched the N2EX power market in the United Kingdom. On 2 February 2010, Nord Pool Spot signed an agreement with the Estonian national grid company Elering to create the Nord Pool Spot Estlink bidding area starting from 1 April 2010. Nord Pool Spot also delivered the technical solution for the Lithuanian market place Baltpool.

Subsequent studies have confirmed that SU6656 is relatively selective for Src family kinases but some additional biochemical activities have been identified including: BRSK2, AMPK, Aurora C, Aurora B, CaMKKŒ≤. The inhibition of these kinases in biochemical reactions in vitro does not necessarily indicate that these kinases are targets of SU6656 in cells. SU6656 has been used primarily as a research tool to investigate the function of Src family kinases in cellular signal transduction processes and biology.

His own writings were circulated widely to The Gettysburg Times and many other newspapers.  Biography   Early life and education  Born in Saline, Michigan, George Matthew Adams graduated from Ottawa University in Kansas. Employed by a Chicago advertising agency, he started operating the elevator and worked his way up to become a copywriter.  George Matthew Adams Newspaper Service  In 1907, Adams borrowed money to rent and equip an office and launched the Adams Newspaper Service.\\"George Matthew Adams Started Syndicate on a Shoestring,\\" Editor & Publisher (Julv 21, 1934). Adams' syndicate was located at 8 West 40th Street in Manhattan. When Adams and Emporia Gazette publisher William Allen White met in Chicago in 1908, Adams hired White to write about political issues. Adams had copies of Walt Mason's light verse which he had clipped from the Gazette, and said, \\"I like this stuff. I'd like to syndicate it to other papers. Suppose I could?\\" White responded, \\"Sure. Give Uncle Walt about $18 a week, and he'll be tickled pink to do it for you.\\" Adams did, and as Mason's Rippling Rhythms column increased in popularity, he eventually increased Mason's salary to $15,000 a year. The name of the Adams Newspaper Service was changed in 1916 to the George Matthew Adams Service. Writers syndicated by Adams included Thornton Burgess, Edgar Guest and Robert Ripley. The syndicate also distributed single-panel cartoons, including some accompanied by jokes, backwoods homilies, light verse or Adams- style inspiration. Adams syndicated comic strips, including Billy DeBeck's Finn an' Haddie, Percy Crosby's The Clancy Kids, (Edwina Dumm's Cap Stubbs and Tippie, Ed Wheelan's Minute Movies, and Robert Baldwin's Freddy. In addition to sports cartoons by Lank Leonard, Adams syndicated Johnny Gruelle's illustrated Raggedy Ann panels from 1934 to 1938. The uplifting Raggedy Ann verses emphasized forthrightness, honesty, kindness and thrift. He also syndicated Rebecca McCann's philosophical The Cheerful Cherub. Lloyd Jacquet was the syndicate's art director from c. 1936 to 1937,Lloyd Jacquet entry, Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928‚Äì1999.

Archived at \\"News of Yore 1946: Syndicate Executives Profiled,\\" Stripper's Guide (July 21, 2010). Adams's syndicate peaked in the 1920s and 1930s, eventually fading as its founder aged. In the company's latter years, the president and general manager was Harry E. Elmlark. Adams died in 1962; the remaining features were sold to The Washington Star Company in May 1965, thus forming the Washington Star Syndicate.Boyd, Crosby N., President. \\"THE WASHINGTON STAR HAS PURCHASED THE GEORGE MATTHEW ADAMS SERVICE, A NEWSPAPER FEATURE SYNDICATE,\\" The Washington Star (May 9, 1965). Archived at CIA.gov.  Writing  In the 1910s, Adams was selling Dr. Frank Crane's (1861‚Äì1928) popular Four Minute Essays. When he lost Crane to a competitor, he decided to write short inspirational essays himself while he traveled from city to city selling to newspapers. By the 1950s, Crane was all but forgotten, but Adams' short inspirational columns, titled Today's Talk, were in about 100 newspapers and also collected in a series of books.Tripp, Frank. \\"About the columners\\", The Day, May 17, 1954.WorldCat Books * You Can: A Collection of Brief Talks on the Most Important Topic in the World ‚Äî Your Success (Frederick A.

Ayalew Birru was a relative of Taytu Betul. From 1883 to 1913, Taytu was the wife of Emperor Menelek II and, from 1889 to 1913, she was Empress of the Ethiopian Empire. Birru Wolde Gabriel was even rumoured to be the \\"natural\\" son of Menelik. During his lifetime, Ayalew Birru held a number of important governorships.Haile Selassie, Volume II, p. 104 From 1916, he was Shum of Wagara. From 1928, he was Shum of Semien Province. From 1917 to 1918, after Lij Iyasu was deposed, Ayalew Birru was made the Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Army by Ras Tafari Makonnen.Haile Selassie I, Volume I, p. 51 On 18 January 1918, Ayalew Birru married Woizerit Hoy Manyahilush Kassa. Manyahilush was the second daughter of Ras Kassa Haile Darge. Ayalew Birru and Manyahilush Kassa had children including a son. Late in 1928, the Raya people revolted in Wollo Province. Negus Tafari Makonnen called for the governors of several neighboring provinces to suppress the revolt. Dejazmach Ayalew Birru, as Shum of Semien, was one of the governors called upon. Unlike many of the others called upon, Ayalew Birru strenuously fought the revolting people in Lasta. Because of this, Ras Gugsa Welle, Shum of Begemder Province was able to take advantage of his absence in Semien. While Ayalew Birru was away, Gugsa Welle managed to bring most of Simien under his own control. Gugsa Welle and Ayalew Birru were cousins and both were closely related to Empress Taytu Betel.Mockler, p. 9 In 1930, Ras Gugsa Welle's desire to remove Negus Tafari led to his raising an army in rebellion against him. As Qegnazmach, Ayalew Birru led a portion of the Imperial Army against the rebelling Ras Gugsa Welle and was one of the heroes of the Battle of Anchem. However, because he was seen as being too closely related to Empress Taytu Betel, Ayalew Birru was not made a Ras as a result of his heroism. His people sang of his plight: \\"Ayalew the fool, the innocent; Trust men, trusts men.\\"Mockler, p. 12 In 1931, Ayalew Birru was rewarded by being named Fitawrari and Minister of War. Between 1933 and 1934, Ayalew Birru fell into disfavor with the Emperor; most likely over money. As result, he was exiled to Arsi Province.Haile Selassie, Volume II, p. 104 In 1935, during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Ayalew Birru returned from exile and again supported the Emperor against his enemy.Haile Selassie, Volume II, p. 104 However, his initial support for the war was less than wholehearted. When ordered to harass and possibly invade the western Eritrean lowlands, he fell ill. According to a Swedish doctor flown in to help him, Ayalew Birru \\"underwent a cure, abiding his time.\\" His illness verged on the \\"diplomatic\\" and, after it was indicated that he had made contact with the Italians, his loyalty was questioned. In the end, it must be remembered that Fitawrari Ayalew Birru was a war leader of great reputation. He was no callow and untried princeling.Mockler, p. 80 Ayalew Birru joined forces with the forces of Ras Imru Haile Selassie and, in late 1935, advanced against the Italians during the Christmas Offensive.Mockler, p. 78 His forces played a significant part in the Battle at Dembeguina Pass. In early March 1936, the Battle of Shire was lost by the Ethiopians and Ayalew Birru left the site of the Battle headed homeward. However, when it became clear that the Italians had entered his Semien Province, he went to Debre Tabor in Begemder Province.Haile Selassie, Volume I, p. 270 By May 1936, Ethiopia's armies had been defeated and the war was lost. When the Emperor went into exile, Ayalew Birru followed him to Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine. Ayalew Birru remained in Palestine until the Second World War when he traveled to Khartoum in the Sudan. On 12 July 1940, Ayalew Birru attended a meeting called by the Emperor to discuss the invasion of Italian East Africa. When there were complaints about the quality of the rifles being supplied by the British,Haile Selassie, Volume II, p. 107 he was sent by the Emperor to inspect the military equipment in Begemder Province.Haile Selassie, Volume II, p. 133 In 1941, during the East African Campaign, Birru Ayalew was again at the side of the Emperor and he was made the putative commander of Arbegnoch forces in Begemder. After the war, Ayalew Birru was named a Ras and served for a time as the Shum of Kaffa and Jimma.

Background Kirwan was born at Tobar Caoch (the Blindwell), near Kilconly, Tuam, sometime around 1830. Her grandfather was Martin Kirwan of the Blindwell, once High Sheriff of Galway; his eldest child - one of three sons and two daughters, was Martin Kirwan, who in 1801 married Mary Burke of Glinsk Castle, County Galway. Their children were Martin Staunton Kirwan (1802‚Äì61), James (died 30 May 1865), Thomas Staunton of the Blindwell (alive 1874?), William (died 15 June 1864), Catherine (died 13 January 1866) and Charlotte Margaret, who took the name Magdalen in religion. Profession and Goldenbridge Charlotte entered the Mercy Convent on Dublin's Baggot Street on 24 August 1851, and was professed there in September 1854. She took the name Magdalen. Her organisation skills were recognised, and within some eighteen months Kirwan was put in charge of a refuge for women who had served prison sentences and who needed rehabilitation before joining society. This was Goldenbridge, opened in 1856. Sr. Teresa Delaney writes that: > It was described as been very unprisonlike in appearance and ... was a > halfway house where women serving penal servitude spent the final part of > their sentences. Compared to the prison regime the refuge appears to have > been fairly relaxed. The person in charge, Sr. Magdalen Kirwan, was known in > the usage of the time as Mrs. Kirwan. The success of the institution can be > attributed to her, for her manner was described as gentle and winning, yet > with a decisive and energetic will to \\"exercise a powerful influence on > those whom she had to control\\". Someone praised \\"her frank, motherly nature, > active mind and acute intellect, which helped her to deal with a class to > whom deception and idleness have become second nature.\\" The main source of income was the laundry run by the sisters. By 1884 fully one thousand, two hundred and thirty-two women had passed through Goldenbridge. According to Kirwan, three-quarters of them turned out well. She recounted that many had emigrated, and that she had received many letters and photographs from them, but stated \\" ... when they marry I drop the correspondence. The moment a woman becomes Mrs. So and So I say 'you must not write to me now' - I drop the correspondence at once.\\" She encouraged the women to tell future husbands of their backgrounds, and in some cases, some requested that she do it for them. Sr. Magdalen Kirwan died at Goldenbridge in February 1906 and is buried in the sister's cemetery. The Phoenix Park Murders On 6 May 1882 in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Henry Burke (newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, and Burke was the Permanent Undersecretary, respectively) were stabbed to death by members of the Irish National Invincibles. Burke was Kirwan's first cousin. One of those arrested, tried and sentenced to death, Joe Brady, could not bring himself to forgive the informer, though he did forgive the judge, jury, jailers and police for doing their job. The prison chaplain enslisted the aid of Sr. Magdalen, though it is unknown if he was aware of her relationship with Burke. Up to the time of her last visit on 13 May 1883 - the day before Brady's execution - her efforts to guide him to forgiveness had failed. As she left, she turned at the door and addressed him: > The man you so barbarously killed without a moment's warning, and sent > before the judgement of God, was a dear cousin of mine, and I came to tell > you I have freely forgiven you and the others who took part in the deed, and > so, if I forgive, why not you forgive the informers? Although they swore > away your life they did not kill you. You were given plenty of time to > repent, so will you now grant my request and forgive them? Brady became agitated, proclaiming that It is hard. However, after a pause, he stated that he forgave them. His last wish was that Sr. Magdalen should meet his mother and console her following his execution the next morning. After her death, John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, erected at his own expense a window memorial in memory of Kirwan in the chapel of the Dominicans at Dominick Street, Dublin.

A young woman whose only asset is a supremely beautiful face is about to make a society marriage until her fianc√© discovers that, being virtually blind, she needs thick glasses which ruin her looks. Plot summary The anonymous narrator, a bachelor artist, visits Folkestone and sees a young woman with an astonishly beautiful face. From a friend, the widowed Mrs Meldrum who has to wear disfiguring glasses, he learns that she is Flora Saunt, an orphan. She has an admirer in Lord Iffield, heir to a country estate but not very bright. Another admirer, also well off, is Geoffrey Dawling, who is intelligent and sympathetic but not good looking. Flora agrees to sit for a portrait by the narrator, who discovers that, having little money or brain, her only goal in life is to acquire a husband. After she succeeds in getting engaged to Iffield, the narrator sees the two in a London shop where, to inspect an item, she surreptitiously uses a pince-nez. Momentarily, the beauty of her face is ruined. Revisiting Folkestone later, in the distance he sees a woman in corrective glasses who he takes to be Mrs Meldrum. In fact, to the embarrassment of both, it is Flora. Dropped by Iffield when he realised her sight was failing, she has been given a home by the kindly Mrs Meldrum. Some time later in London, the narrator attends a performance of Lohengrin. In a box, he sees a beautiful woman wearing expensive jewels who he thinks must be Flora. She points her opera glasses at him and smiles. Going up to her box and kissing her hand in greeting, he realises she is now blind. Geoffrey, her loving husband whose lack of looks she cannot see, rejoins the two. Characters *Miss Flora Saunt, a young woman of uncommon beauty and excessive vanity, orphaned *Mrs. Meldrum, a woman who wears thick eyeglasses *Mr. Geoffrey Dawling, an undistinguished Oxford intellectual who is not good- looking and who is in love with Flora *Lord Iffield, soon to be Lord Considine, briefly engaged to Flora *Narrator, an artist Publication history \\"Glasses\\" first appeared in the Atlantic Monthly in February 1896. Its hardcover debut, in a volume titled Embarrassments, came in June 1896 from London publisher William Heinemann and the Macmillan Company in New York. Three other stories appear in the book: \\"The Figure in the Carpet\\", \\"The Next Time\\", and \\"The Way It Came\\". \\"Glasses\\" was the only story in Embarrassments excluded from the New York Edition of 1909. Misc * Complete Stories 1892‚Äì1898 from Library of America * Terence Feeley's 1974 TV series for ITV (London), \\"Affairs of the Heart\\" included a dramatisation of \\"Glasses\\", under title of \\"Flora\\". The leading woman was played by Gayle Hunnicutt (beautiful in face, but with large teeth that belie her claim to total beauty). The older, wiser woman with thick spectacles and a heart of gold, was played by Patricia Routledge (later famous for her role as \\"Hyacinth Bucket\\" in the popular comedy series \\"Keeping Up Appearances\\". The \\"surgical glasses\\" shown in the dramatisation are extremely thick, and marked by a \\"bar\\" across the centre. They are referred to as \\"goggles\\". The aristocrat was played as a Monty Python upper-class twit, with clipped words, and a terrible pronunciation. The gentle eventual-husband was played as having a strong stammer, but a heart, also, of gold, able, when relaxed, to speak freely. At the very end, in the opera-box, when the full, sad consequences are grasped - she is as beautiful as ever, and utterly blind‚Äîthe husband remarks that the blindness \\"is irrelevant\\".

Biography George Walton was born in Glasgow in 1862. He was the youngest of twelve talented children of Jackson Walton, a Manchester commission agent and himself an accomplished painter and photographer, by his second wife, the Aberdeen-born Quaker Eliza Ann Nicholson. George was a brother of the painter Edward Arthur Walton of the Glasgow School.Moon, Karen: George Walton: Designer and Architect, pages 15-20. Oxford: White Cockade Publishing, 2001. Work in Glasgow and Scarborough His father's death in 1873 left the family in straitened circumstances, and at the age of thirteen George started work as a clerk with the British Linen Bank. With a view to a different career, he attended art classes in the evenings at the Glasgow School of Art and with Peter McGregor Wilson (1856‚Äì1928) at the short-lived Glasgow Atelier of Fine Arts. When he was commissioned to redesign one of Miss Cranston's tea rooms at 114 Argyle Street in Glasgow, Walton started his own decorating company, George Walton & Co, Ecclesiastical and House Decorators, in 1888 at 152 Wellington Street.Moon, page 23 The peacock became the firm‚Äôs emblem. Moon, page 34 His arts and crafts style of decoration, including his woodblock printed wallpaper production, was influenced by William Morris Moon, page 23-25 and included stencilling, a common technique in Scotland at this time, and highly decorated wall surfaces in floral patterns, in line with prevailing fashion and also influenced by Japanese pattern books reflecting Glasgow‚Äôs then active trade with Japan. He was also greatly influenced by James WhistlerMoon, pages 28-29 His work ventured into almost every avenue of decorative art, helping to pioneer the distinctive Glasgow Style. In 1890 he employed Robert Graham, the future manager of the company in 1903‚Äì05, and met the Quaker architect Fred Rowntree (1860‚Äì1927) at an amateur dramatic performance. On 3 June 1891 Walton married Kate Gall, a London girl from an affluent family, and moved into Charing Cross Mansions. Their daughter was born in 1892. Moon, page 26 In the 1890s he was responsible for decorating St Peter‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Braid Street, Glasgow.Moon, page 24 The company became known for its stained glass, exhibiting at the Glasgow Institute in 1889 Moon, page 27 He was one of the pioneers in the use of domestic stained glass in Glasgow. Moon, page 96 In 1892 he worked on the house of the shipping magnate William Burrell and in 1893 he decorated ‚ÄòDrumalis‚Äô the mansion owned by Sir Hugh Houston Smiley, 1st Baronet located in Larne, Northern Ireland and this remains his most complete extant company job. Moon, page 34 Walton's firm rapidly diversified, winning commissions in woodwork, furniture making and stained glass. From 1896 Walton partnered with Fred Rowntree, in Rowntree family projects in their home town of Scarborough. In 1896, this led to his first commission in England Moon, page 41 for John Rowntree, who owned a cafe in the town.Moon, page 45 This project saw Walton‚Äôs first significant foray into furniture design, including the distinctive ‚ÄòAbingwood‚Äô chair. Walton‚Äôs style by this stage was developing restrained ornament set off against plain surfaces. Moon, pages 46-48 In the same year he decorated and furnished Miss Cranston's Buchanan Street tea room, originally designed by George Washington Browne where Walton continued to develop his stencilling technique having abandoned wallpaper in favour of this more versatile technique. A review by Joseph Gleeson White commented on the elegant simplicity of Walton‚Äôs design despite the involvement of Washington Brown, whose work was considered heavy-handed. Moon, page 51. Walton also designed the furniture which was noted for its ‚Äòsinuous verticality‚Äô and accorded with the Glasgow Style aesthetic. Moon, page 53 Work in London and with photographers In 1896 Walton converted his company into a limited joint-stock company with the majority of the shares held by Walton and most of the rest of the shares held by Rowntree and in 1897 Walton joined his brother Edward in London and set up house at 16 Westbourne Park Grove, Bayswater where he had a studio in the garden.Moon, pages 57-58 He now styled himself as an artist in the Post Office Directory, instead of a painter and decorator.Moon, pages 59-60 In London his work came from personal connections with photographers. Through his friendship with the Glasgow photographer James Craig Annan, he designed a salon in the Dudley Gallery, Piccadilly, London. This commission involved placing pictures in groups and sub-groups in an irregular pattern with varying spaces between frames and rejected traditional practices of ‚Äòskying and diving‚Äô (which involved covering every available wall space). The Photography Annual declared this to be ‚Äòthe first time the geometrical, symmetrical, traditional manner had been completely abandoned‚Äô. In this exhibition he displayed only the highest quality pictures on a burnt sienna canvas. Moon, pages 59-60 In London he met George Davison (1854‚Äì1930) who was employed by Eastman Kodak. Through him Walton designed two rooms at the Eastman Exhibition which was critically acclaimed as ‚Äòthe biggest and best thing ever done‚Äô in Britain by way of a photographic exhibition Moon, page 61 This led to a commission to design a new head office and showroom for Eastman‚Äôs European operations on Clerkenwell Road Moon, page 62 and later their new showroom at 171-3 Regent Street Moon, page 71-74 Walton went on to design up to three showroom designs for the company across Europe every year and each of them had Walton‚Äôs Glasgow flavour which made them distinct and novel. His commissions to design Kodak showrooms in the United Kingdom and Europe (London, Glasgow, Brussels, Milan, Vienna and Moscow) brought him international fame. He also designed the company's product packaging.Moon, page 80-82 Further work in Glasgow and Yorkshire Walton worked on Ledcameroch, Bearsden near Glasgow for J B Gow, in 1897 where there was a lightness of touch reflecting his recent experience in exhibition design. In 1898 he worked on William Seaton‚Äôs tea room chain in Glasgow and in Yorkshire. A major commission from 1898 was the redecorating and furnishing of Elm Bank, York, for Sidney Leetham which included Japanese elements. Elm Bank is now a hotel and his work here reflected a new assurance in his approach. Moon, pages 64-70 His company opened a showroom in York's Stonegate in 1898 and erected a four-storey block of workshops at 35-7 Buccleuch Street, in Glasgow in 1899 and 1900. From 1901 Walton undertook the construction of complete buildings, making use of experience from his association with Fred Rowntree. In 1901 Walton made the unusual step of becoming an architect, while many architects crossed over to interior design few moved in the other direction. His first commission was ‚ÄòThe Leys‚Äô for James Brooker Blakemoor Wellington (1858‚Äì1939) of Wellington & Ward Ltd, photographic materials manufacturers and previously of the Eastman company. The house is arts and crafts in style, large and unpretentious using vernacular materials and detailing with a triple-height hall containing one of his finest fireplace designs. The building has plain interiors and a simplicity of design reflecting a leaner and more sophisticated Walton Moon, pages 83-91 His increasing reputation among photographers also led to more commissions for exhibitions. Moon, pages 76-78 Increasing prosperity and focus on work in England As Walton increased his activity and prosperity in 1901 he moved to a more fashionable address at 44 Holland Park Road in Holland Park. He resigned from George Walton & Co on 17 January 1903 and the York branch closed shortly afterwards and on 30 June 1905 the remaining partners wound up the company, which was based mainly in Glasgow.Moon, page 116 From then on Walton practised only as architect and designer. He continued to work on interiors, such as Alma House, Cheltenham and Finnart House, Weybridge, developing a more classical style.Moon, page 117-123 Work at Harlech Photographic panorama showing Harlech Castle, Coleg Harlech and St David's Hotel, taken from the course of The Royal St David's Golf Club In 1906 George Davison decided to build a house at Harlech where his school friend Harry More, Crown Agent for the Forestry Commission in Wales, lived. At this time Harlech had several English families whose social life revolved around Lord Winchelsea, whose brother established the St David‚Äôs golf course in 1894. While developing his idea for a house he also proposed a hotel for golfers using the new golf course, on the recommendation of his English acquaintances in Harlech. By 1907 Walton completed his first designs for the hotel and the ‚ÄòHarlech Hotel and Land Development Syndicate Ltd‚Äô was established. The hotel was known as the St David's Hotel. Davison had expressed a desire for his own castle at Harlech and this defined the brief for the design of his house, which became known as Wern Fawr (now part of Coleg Harlech), a solid and heavy building built in the Georgian style, made of stone blocks and set on the edge of a cliff, mirroring Harlech Castle itself. Wern Fawr, built 1907-1908, reflected the developing vogue at this time for English Classicism. Moon, page 137-138. Admission as an architect and later life Walton was admitted as Licentiate of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 20 July 1911, his proposer being his long-standing friend Charles Edward Mallows. From 1905 he had worked from an even grander home at 26 Emperor's Gate in Kensington, but following the outbreak of World War I, commissions were scarce. His wife Kate died and the generous financial support from the Gall family ceased. In 1916 Walton moved to Carlisle and between 1916 and 1921, working under Harry Redfern, he produced designs for pubs and canteens for the Central Control Board, established to manage the drinks trade and public houses in many munitions production areas. Walton married a colleague, Dorothy (Daphne) Jeram, daughter of a Hampshire doctor on 20 November 1918, and a son was born in 1920. In 1919 Walton attempted to revive his private practice, with the support of various friends and the Scottish portrait-painter William Oliphant Hutchison (1889‚Äì1970), who had married his niece, and painted a striking portrait of Walton 10 years before his death. He now worked mainly as a textile designer for Morton Sundour Fabrics of Carlisle, but this work also ceased due to the recession and a falling-off in demand for Art Nouveau designs. In March 1931 the Waltons moved to 70 Seabrook Road in Hythe to cut down on living expenses. A despondent Walton died on 10 December 1933. John Betjeman obtained a civil list pension for his widow. Walton's drawings and photographs relating to his later practice are in the British Architectural Library Collection.

The character is usually depicted as a member of the Strikeforce: Morituri. The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Aline Pagrovna (Blackthorn) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #1 (December 1986), a Marvel Comics series set in a dystopian future, where young people, intent on fighting an invading alien species, undergo a scientific process which grants them superhuman abilities, albeit significantly reducing their lifespan in the process. The codename \\"Blackthorn\\" was introduced in issue #2. Blackthorn remained in the regular cast of the book throughout Strikeforce: Morituri #1-15. She subsequently went missing, before reappearing in issues #19-20, which tied up her hanging story threads and ended with her inevitable death. Blackthorn was the last member of the original roster to die and also has the distinction of appearing in more issues of the series than any other Morituri member, appearing in a total of 16 issues. Together with Adept, Blackthorn was the favorite character of series creator Peter B. Gillis, thus explaining her prominence and longevity, amidst the ever-shifting cast of the book. According to Gillis, Blackthorn \\"had some of the best moments in the book. Which is partly why I killed her last ‚Äî sort of a Hannibal Lecter thing to say, isn‚Äôt it?\\".The University of Chicago Magazine, Volume 97, Number 2, December 2004 Fictional character biography Aline L. Pagrovna was a self-described \\"wallflower\\", always shy and unnoticed by others and without ever having had a romantic relationship. The only reason she did not commit suicide was because she was confident nobody would notice.Strikeforce: Morituri #1 In 2073, faced with the prospect of a long, boring, eventless life, Pagrovna decided to volunteer for the Morituri program, a program which would grant her superhuman powers, effectively turning her into a living weapon of Earth in its ongoing war against the invading alien race collectively known as \\"the Horde\\". The process, however, essentially equals suicide, because the recipients of the process inevitably suffer the so-called \\"Morituri effect\\" within a year of undertaking the process, a 100% fatal rejection of the process by the human organism. After meeting the specific biological criteria which ensure whether a person's organism can be compatible with the process, Pagrovna becomes the first member of the premier generation of Strikeforce: Morituri to undergo the process. Like all recipients of the process, Pagrovna initially acquires enhanced strength, a by-product of the first stage of the Morituri process, which strengthens the organism of its recipients, in preparation for the later stages. Later, one night, while under great stress, Pagrovna manifests her superhuman power, the ability to disrupt molecular bonds in all substances. Subsequently, she gives herself the anonym \\"Blackthorn\\".Strikeforce: Morituri #2 Blackthorn participates in various missions with the team, which quickly becomes hailed as humanity's saviors. After the team gives its first press conference, Blackthorn and her teammates attend a party in New York, where they meet the actors that will portray them in an upcoming video series. Blackthorn meets Guy Harding, a famous actor who portrays her teammate, Radian, in the series, and begins flirting with him.Strikeforce: Morituri #4 Blackthorn then begins a string of numerous casual relationships, making up for the fact she never had a boyfriend before.Strikeforce: Morituri #5 After they meet again later in a party in Holowood (21st-century Hollywood), Blackthorn and Guy begin a romantic relationship, despite Blackthorn's concerns that he becomes involved with her for publicity reasons.Strikeforce: Morituri #6Strikeforce: Morituri #8 Pregnancy and death Later, while the team raids a Horde mothership in orbit around Jupiter, one of the team members, Adept, embraces Blackthorn and, through her analytic abilities, realizes she is pregnant. Blackthorn is shocked, since she realizes she does not have enough time left to bring the baby to term.Strikeforce: Morituri #12 Upon returning to Earth, the team confronts the newer generation of Morituri, who have been assigned by their employers, the Paedia Council, to detain the veteran members, who are now perceived as \\"renegades\\", after violating regulations. During the battle, one of the new members, Wildcard, feels his death approaching due to the Morituri effect. In his panic, he reaches out to Blackthorn, copying her powers, as his own Morituri abilities detected something keeping her Morituri Effect in check, not realizing that this unknown factor was her pregnancy. As Wildcard's body melts, Blackthorn is horrified, knowing how her death from the Morituri effect will occur. The team is later acquitted of all charges.Strikeforce: Morituri #13-14 After Radian, the last other surviving Morituri of her generation dies, Blackthorn flees from the Morituri base, keeping her pregnancy a secret from her superiors.Strikeforce: Morituri #16 Blackthorn moves with Guy in a mansion in Carmel, California, leading a peaceful life. The couple considers asking the help of the Paedia government in putting their unborn daughter in an incubator in order to save her life, since Blackthorn can die from the inescapable Morituri effect at any given minute. However, they also fear that the Paedia, which has visibly exploited the lives of the Morituri on occasion, will take their newborn daughter away from Guy to perform genetic tests on her, a prospect that both Guy and Blackthorn resent.Strikeforce: Morituri #19 Eventually, Dr. Kimmo Tuolema, the inventor of the Morituri process and a trustworthy supporter of the Morituri, secretly visits Guy and Blackthorn and manages to extract the baby from the pregnant Aline, putting it in an incubator. Tuolema explains that Blackthorn has outlived the one-year limit of the Morituri process - approximately thirteen months have passed since she underwent the process - thanks to her pregnancy. Tuolema explains that the Morituri effect is actually the catastrophic rejection of the foreign high- energy metabolism, inserted through the Morituri process, by the host's organism, leaving it without metabolism and thus killing it. However, because of the baby she carried, Blackthorn had a second metabolism, that of the baby, which somehow protected her and prolonged her life. Shortly afterwards, Aline succumbs to the Morituri effect and melts in the arms of Guy.Strikeforce: Morituri #20 Guy is later seen raising their newborn daughter, whom he has named \\"Aline\\", in her honor.Strikeforce: Morituri #27 Powers and abilities Blackthorn had the ability to disrupt the molecular bonds of virtually every substance, living or inanimate, causing it to break or melt. She only faced difficulty when confronted with extremely thick materials. Like all Morituri recipients, Blackthorn also had enhanced strength, as a result of her exposure to the Morituri process. Like her teammates, she wore specially designed boots which enabled her to fly.

The Ring of Fire development would impact nine First Nations, and potential developers are required to negotiate an Impact Benefit Agreement with these communities prior to development. The region is centred on McFaulds Lake, near the Attawapiskat River in Kenora District, approximately northeast of Thunder Bay, about east of Webequie, and due north of Marten Falls and Ogoki Post, which is near/on the (Albany River) west of James Bay. The Ring of Fire was named when the first significant mineral finds were made in the region, by Richard Nemis,The team credited with the 2007 discovery of Noront's Eagle's Nest nickel-PGE deposit in the Ring of Fire include Richard Nemis, a Sudbury-born lawyer became a mining promoter, founder and past-President of Noront Resources Ltd. with John Harvey, Don Hoy, Neil Novak and Mac Watson. Nemis stepped down as President from Noront in 2008. He started two new companies, Rencore Resources Ltd. and Bold Ventures Inc Sudbury Mining Solutions after Johnny Cash's famous country and western ballad. Nemis, the founder and president of Noront Resources, was a lifelong fan of the singer. Prior to its discovery, Canada and the United States were compelled to rely on offshore sources for chromite, principally from South Africa.Christina Blizzard, \\"A glimmer of hope in the north\\". Ottawa Sun, February 16, 2010, p. 15. By the fall of 2011, the Ring of Fire was considered \\"one of the largest potential mineral reserves in Ontario\\" with \\"more than 35 junior and intermediate mining and exploration companies covering an area of about \\"1.5 million hectares\\". Although the Ring of Fire crescent covers 5,000 square kilometres (approximately 1,930 square miles), most discoveries made by 2012 were within a twenty-kilometre-long strip. Ontario's Minister of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry Michael Gravelle called the region \\"home to one of the most promising mineral development opportunities in Ontario in more than a century\\". Tony Clement, Canada's Treasury Board President and the FedNor minister responsible for the Ring of Fire, claimed it will be the economic equivalent of the Athabasca oil sands, with a potential of generating $120 billion. Clement says the Ring of Fire represents a \\"once-in-a-life opportunity to create jobs and generate growth and long-term prosperity for northern Ontario and the nation\\". Challenges facing the development of the Ring of Fire mineral include lack of access to the remote region, infrastructure deficits such as roads, railway, electricity and broadband, First Nations land rights, and environmental issues in the James Bay Lowlands, the \\"third largest wetland in the world\\". Clement was looking to business, not the federal government, to invest \\"in power and transportation infrastructure to develop the deposit\\". By 2019, the mining company with the most holdings in the Ring of Fire was the Canadian company‚ÄîNoront Resources Ltd.‚Äîwith palladium, nickel, platinum, and copper deposit in Eagle's Nest, and chromite deposits including Big Daddy, Black Thor, and Blackbird. Ring of Fire overview In May 2012, Cliffs Natural Resources announced a \\"$3.3-billion investment to build a chromite mine, transportation corridor and processing facility in northern Ontario's Ring of Fire that would lead to a new generation of prosperity in the north, with thousands of jobs and new infrastructure\\". Natural Resources minister Michael Gravelle announced that the smelter would be in Sudbury, Ontario. On 26 April 2013, Tony Clement called the Ring of Fire the oil sands of Ontario. On 13 June 2013, Cliffs announced it would put its $3.3-billion project on hold pending results of negotiations between First Nations and Queen's Park. Clement said that the Ring of Fire would bring \\"about a hundred years of mining activity that will spin-off jobs and economic activity for generations\\". In May 2012, Cliffs Natural Resources announced its intention of investing $3.3-billion in Northern Ontario's Ring of Fire region, which would include a chromite mine, a transportation corridor and a smelter in Sudbury, Ontario. Cliffs initially invested $550-million to acquire and begin development. By 2013, Cliffs had suspended the project \\"after numerous delays and difficult discussions with the province [of Ontario] and the First Nations communities\\". Updated May 12, 2018 Cliffs sold its assets to the smaller Canadian company, Noront Resources Ltd. for USD20 million. Transportation corridor According to Northern Ontario Business article, Cliffs Natural Resources, the Ohio-based firmed that held the majority share in Big Daddy chromite deposit, was seeking an easement through Ontario's Mining and Landings Commissioner on the KWG corridor to build their access road. The minority share partner in Big Daddy, KWG Resources, a Toronto-based junior miner, held a 30 percent stake and were also interested in the development of transportation corridor.Profile of KWG Resources Inc.; stockhouse. Retrieved 2017-05-29. In February 2013, KWG had released the report it commissioned by the engineering firm Tetra Tech regarding the viability of building a railroad, instead of a road, to access chromite in the Ring of Fire. Big Daddy chromite deposit to CN Rail (CN) near Nakina, Ontario. According to KWG, KWG's 100 percent owned subsidiary, Canada Chrome Corporation, had \\"conducted a $15 million surveying and soil testing program for the engineering and construction of a railroad to the Ring of Fire from Exton, Ontario.\\" The February 2013 Tetra Tech engineering firm report said that concluded that a railroad would provide better access to ore in the Ring of Fire, than a road. By April 2013, Canada Chrome Corporation, had \\"staked a -kilometre-long \\"string of mining claims\\" which would eventually provide a transportation corridor from the Big Daddy chromite deposit to CN Rail (CN) near Nakina, Ontario. In an April 2013 interview, Moe Lavigne, VP of KWG Resources, a former Ontario Geological Survey geologist, said that the federal government would consider Tetra Tech's findings. Lavigne, said that they had staked mining claims to eventually build the railroad and make their stranded assets \\"viable.\\" Lavigne said that \\"Ontario's Mining Act would safeguard his company's corridor claims.\\" In November 2013, The Globe and Mail, reported on the controversy over whether the province of Ontario, could afford a CAD$2.25 billion road the Trans-Canada Highway near Kenora to the Ring of Fire. In the spring of 2016, engineers from the Xian, China-based China Railway Group Limited (FSDI)‚Äîwhich is owned by the Government of China through the China Railway Engineering Corporation‚Äîand KWG's Moe Lavigne visited the Ring of Fire in Northern Ontario to explore a potential north- south route for a chromite ore-haul railroad from the Ring of Fire. KWG's Chinese partners feasibility study had concluded that the route that traverses the traditional territory of the Marten Falls First Nation (MFFN) to reach Nakina in northwestern Ontario, was a \\"viable alignment\\". China consumes approximately 60% of the world's ferrochrome production. According to an April 2017 Northern Ontario Business article, KWG said it was \\"working towards\\" creating an \\"equal partnership\\" to develop the chromite deposit with one of the First Nation's communities, Marten Falls First Nation, whose traditional territory includes the Ring of Fire nickel and chromite deposits and would also be traversed by the proposed north-south railway. The five Ring of Fire mining companies began planning on extending partnership offers to other nearby communities such as Aroland First Nation and Webequie First Nation, the Northern Ontario Business said. Aroland First Nation signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Norand on June 6, 2019, regarding the development of Norand's Eagle's Nest nickel and base metal deposit. In April 2017, KWG also requested a guarantee of a billion dollars from Ontario's Ring of Fire Infrastructure Development Corporation (ROFIDC) to use as \\"consideration for project financing terms from Chinese lenders.\\" In 2017, then-Ontario Premier, Kathleen Wynne, pledged support for the construction of a year-round access road from Nibinamik and Webequie First Nations, to Ontario Highway 599 at Pickle Lake, which would \\"also facilitate access to the Ring of Fire, located about north of Thunder Bay. In May 2017, representatives from KWG and the Marten Falls First Nation (MFFN), made an official visit to FSDI headquarters in Xian, China The FSDI feasibility study estimated that the capital cost of building the Far North railroad would be about $2 billion, says a June 2017 Northern Ontario Business article. The same article said that the proposed railroad would transport 10 million tonnes of chromite annually by 2030, potentially growing to a yearly volume of up to 24 million tonnes by 2040. To complete the project, KWG was seeking financing from both China and the Government of Ontario, including supply agreements with the Chinese stainless steel industry. KWG CEO Smeenk proposed the creation of the James Bay & Lowlands Transportation Authority, which would be \\"similar to an airport or port authority\\". He said that the federal government should participate in the Ring of Fire development by creating James Bay & Lowlands Transportation Authority‚Äî\\"similar to a port of airport‚Äî for the purpose of transporting ore from the Ring of Fire to Sault Ste. Marie where there is already a port and a rail line. The railway runs from Sault Ste. Marie to Hearst which is \\"half way to the Ring of Fire\\". Smeenk told Postmedia that in the current \\"political realities\\" and \\"regulatory environments\\", in order to extract minerals from the Ring of Fire and to avoid \\"political whims\\" from preventing the extraction of the minerals in the future, in was necessary to do \\"business with the United States.\\" In KWG hosted a fundraising event on April 5, 2018, Toronto's original stock exchange Bay Street in support of the establishment of the Transportation Authority to facilitate the transport of chromite ore \\"from the Ring of Fire to a proposed KWG processing plant in Sault Ste. Marie.\\" Invited guests included Premier Doug Ford, Maxime Bernier, and Chief Jason Gauthier, of the Missinabie Cree First Nation. KWG CEO Smeenk said that the transportation corridor would \\"ensure the viability\\" of the Algoma Central Railway, which is one of the goals of the Missanabie First Nation. The invitation for the April 5 event announced a discussion on the merits of \\"making ferrochrome in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan for a new North American stainless steel joint-venture with Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\\" Sault Ste. Marie's Mayor Christian Provenzano said in a March 22 news report, expressed concern that he was not aware of this joint venture, nor were their \\"partners in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.\\" The news report said that \\"KWG is believed to be interested in partnering with the United States to take advantage of President Donald Trump's 'America First' approach to international trade.\\" In late August 27, 2019 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario's Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines (MENDM), Greg Rickford, said that the regional framework agreement negotiated in 2014 under between the province and the nine Matawa First Nations, had cost over $20 million and that funding had run out for the agreement in late 2018. Rickford said he was taking a more \\"pragmatic\\" approach with the goal of removing delays to projects, with the north-south corridor that at the top of the list. Rickford wants to work on a series of bilateral agreements with individual communities that would \\"not only could lead to road access to the mineral-rich James Bay lowlands, but can also connect by road, as well as add to the provincial power grid and expand modern telecommunications to, 'at least four, five Indigenous communities.'\\" In a CBC interview he said that, the transportation corridor would have \\"additional health and social and economic benefits that move beyond the more obvious opportunities of creating mines...To the extent that Noront [Resources] or other mining companies could build mines on that corridor, then we have a great value proposition.\\". The mining company, Noront Resources, which holds the largest Ring of Fire claims, and Marten Falls First Nation issued a joint statement welcoming Rickford's announcement. Marten Falls is the proponent of an environmental assessment for the first stage of an access road connecting the community to an all-season road. On the same day, Noront announced that they had issued \\"300,000 shares to Marten Falls First Nation and 150,000 shares to Aroland First Nation\\" as part of their Project Advancement Agreement. Environmental assessments In 2011, environmental assessments by the Canadian federal and Ontario provincial governments began for Cliffs Natural Resources' proposed Black Thor Project and Noront Resources's Eagles Nest Project, with both companies volunteering \\"to make their projects subject to an environmental assessment under the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) and are completing environmental assessments under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA)\\". Natural resources development On 25 October 2010, the Government of Ontario's Far North Act received assent and became law. The Far North Act is an Act With Respect To Land Use Planning and Protection in the Far North, providing \\"a legislative foundation to support Far North land use planning as a joint process between First Nations and Ontario. Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources Ontario developed the Far North Land Use Planning Initiative recognising the Far North of Ontario represents \\"42% of provincial land area\\". The Hudson Bay Lowlands is the \\"third largest wetland in the world.\\" Two-thirds of the Hudson Bay Lowlands is peatland, making it the \\"second largest area of contiguous peatland\\" in the world. There are 24,000 First Nation residents in 34 communities. The forests and peatlands in the Far North store 97 billion tonnes of carbon. The area filters Ontario's air, absorbing 12.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Government of Canada On 12 November 2012, Tony Clement was appointed as the lead federal minister on the Ring of Fire and co-chair, with Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Bernard Valcourt, of the Federal Steering Committee (FCS), which represents 15 federal departments. Clement invited Ontario Natural Resources minister Michael Gravelle \\"to collaborate on projects, community visits, information-sharing, and to hold joint meetings\\". Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) led other federal departments and FedNor in the development of Action Plan for Supporting Community Participation in the Ring of Fire to help \\"position First Nations to benefit from proposed mining projects\\". The Federal Action Plan's whole-of- government approach includes the creation of a one-stop shop, where working group leads, from existing federal working groups in the labour market, infrastructure, community health and well-being, business development and environment form the single point of contact with local First Nations, industry and the province of Ontario. A multi-ministry meeting of federal senior officials had already been organized in April 2012. Until 2015, Greg Rickford was the Member of Parliament for the riding of Kenora, where the Ring of Fire is located, and the Minister of State for FedNor. Action plan for supporting community participation in the Ring of Fire February 2013 briefing notes for Clement warned that the Matawa First Nation communities were among the \\"most socio-economically challenged in Ontario, impacting their ability to meaningfully participate in large complex projects\\". Most of the \\"working age population in the Matawa First Nation communities have not completed high school\\".\\"According to the Assembly of First Nations, data shows the First Nations high school graduation rate is 36 per cent, compared to 72 per cent in Canada overall. A First Nations youth is more likely to end up in jail than graduate high school.\\"Postmedia 1 April 2013 Three of the nine local Matawa First Nations were \\"under financial intervention (co- management)\\". Matawa First Nations lack \\"exposure to a development of this magnitude combined with low educational attainment and other factors suggests that the communities do not currently have the capacity to address the various issues related to the Ring of Fire\\". The Action Plan noted that First Nations were interested in potential legacy impacts of Ring of Fire infrastructure, such as all-weather roads, links to the power grid and high-speed broadband Internet. Industry Canada's Broadband Canada was already laying 2,300 kilometers of fibre optic cable to 26 First Nations across the Far North, including the Ring of Fire. Government of Ontario In April 2010 the government of Ontario announced that it would open a large chromite deposit in the area to development. Ring of Fire Secretariat: Resource revenue sharing with First Nations In 2011, Ontario's Ministry of Northern Development and Mines created the Ring of Fire Secretariat, with Christine Kaszyckias as its coordinator, to develop \\"the chromite and other deposits in the Ring of Fire as quickly as possible and with due regard to environmental impacts and the needs of the Aboriginal communities within the region\\". It outlined strategies regarding First Nations partnerships, including resource revenue sharing,Mining royalties flow to the Province of Ontario not to the First Nations on whose land the mines are located. Victor Mine/Attawapiskat regional infrastructure planning, long-term environmental monitoring, community-based capacity funding, relationship agreements, land use planning, employment and income assistance, skills development, training and job creation, transportation and community infrastructure, and socio-economic and community development in response to concerns by industry and First Nations communities. On May 8, 2012, Premier Dalton McGuinty wrote Prime Minister Stephen Harper, on the eve of Cliffs Natural Resources' announcement of the location of its ferrochrome processing facility, asking for federal government assistance \\"to engage First Nations in the region to help those communities benefit from this historic opportunity\\". Along with federal funds to improve First Nations education on reserves and for drug treatment programs, McGuinty asked for \\"a tripartite process\\". Development proposals By 2012, there were 30,000 claims, 35 prospecting companies, and significant discoveries of chromium, copper, zinc, nickel, platinum, vanadium and gold; there were only two major development proposals, Noront Resources's Eagle's Nest Project and Cliffs Natural Resources. KWG Resources entered into a joint venture agreement with Bold Ventures (TSX:BOL) on its $5 million Koper Lake Project. In February 2013, Richard Nemis, CEO of Bold Ventures, obtained a Marten Falls First Nation Land Use Permit to operate the camp using \\"three diamond drills provided by Cyr International Drilling and Orbit Garant Drilling\\" to carry out approximately of diamond drilling on nickel‚Äêcopper and chromite targets. Operator Bold Ventures was required to cease drilling activities from March 31, 2012, until April 13, 2013, to ensure the First Nations' permit was granted under the Mining Act, and a permit issued by a Director of Exploration from the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines was obtained. Probe Mines owned the entire Victory Project, which consists of \\"452 claims totaling 7,232 hectares and covers the interpreted southeast extension of the McFauld's Lake\\" and the Tamarack Project which \\"comprises 360 claims covering over 5,700 hectares of the McFauld's Lake in the Ring of Fire\\". Noront Resources's Eagle's Nest Project On 28 August 2007, Noront Resources announced the discovery of a \\"large find\\" of \\"high grade deposit\\" of platinum, palladium, nickel, and copper northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Its underground mine project is called the Eagle's Nest Project.According to Gregory Reynolds' 28 July 2008 post on the Republic of Mining, Noront Resources Ltd had drilled two holes in the ground, with one having copper sulfide mineralization and the other hole with similar results. A few months later, Noront announced that it had found nickel, copper, platinum, and palladium a few meters below the surface. To reduce heavy truck traffic, Noront is planning to build a buried -long slurry pipeline, using new technology safety features, from the site to Webequie Junction. Environmental concerns listed in a Lakehead University 2012 report regarding Noront Resources's Eagle's Nest Project include pipeline leaks, a \\"a large edge effect\\", a \\"significant loss of biodiversity at local & regional level\\" from \\"linear constructions\\" such as roads. Despite state-of- the-art technology, environmental risks of underground pipelines in the wetlands, excluding the risk of leaks, include alterations of \\"hydrology, thermal regime, soil structure and vegetation of ecosystem\\". Noront Resources and Marten Falls First Nations, 2003‚Äì2010 In 2003, Noront Resources began using two frozen lakes‚ÄîKoper Lake, located about north of Marten Falls, and McFaulds Lake‚Äîas landing strips without consulting Martens Falls and Webequie First Nations. The Mining ActIn 2009 the Government of Ontario introduced an Act to Amend the Mining Act to update the 1873 Ontario Mining Act, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry (MNDM&F;). Mining interests are allowed access to most of the land in Ontario, including private property and \\"mining projects are exempt from full environmental assessments and are under no obligation to clean up a mining site after the mine has closed\\". The 2009 amendments \\"failed to address the exemption permitted for mining from the environmental assessment process or protect Ontarians from being on the hook to pay for cleanup costs\\".Ontario Nature only allows exploration activities, not the construction of permanent structures. Marten Falls First Nations Chief Eli Moonias explained in 2010 that Noront Resources did not have \\"permits to construct landing strips on the string bog or roads to the nearby airstrip\\". \\"The two First Nations proposed that they should build and maintain the infrastructure to prevent further damage to the wetlands environment.\\" Marten Falls First Nations Chief Eli Moonias described how over a seven-year period, Noront Resources \\"sunk machines here and they have done outrageous acts here\\". In the fall of 2009, the companies \\"used a helicopter to break ice here with a log\\". On February 3, 2010, Noront Resources Ltd. was trying to build a \\"[landing] strip here on the string bog\\". In January 2010, Chief Eli Moonias,The Marten Falls First Nations community consists of about 280 on- reserve band members Wataway . Webequie Chief Cornelius Wabasse, and community members set up a blockade on the landing strips at Koper and McFaulds Lakes. Martens Falls and Webequie First Nations ended their blockade on March 19, 2010, with the admonition that they would resume the action if their concerns were not addressed by Noront within six months.\\"Natives lift Ring of Fire blockade\\". Toronto Star, March 20, 2010. Although the protest ended, Noront continued to use the frozen lakes as landing strips until break-up in 2010. Chief Eli Moonias expressed environmental concerns over \\"sewage, grey-water, oil spills and road clearing\\" over the seven-year period. Cliffs acquires Freewest Resources Canada Black Thor 2009 Cliffs Natural Resources, of Cleveland, Ohio, originally had an \\"ambitious timetable for developing the Black Thor chromite deposit\\", hoping to complete permits and environmental assessment approvals by the end of 2013 (MRI). In September 2003, a junior company, Freewest Resources Canada, began exploring Black Thor using airborne geophysics and ground geophysics. In February 2008 findings of a chromite prospect with an estimated strike length, a depth of , and a width containing an estimated 72 megatonnes of chromite ore (42% Cr2O3). in September 2009. In October 2009, Noront Resources (NOT-V) made a hostile takeover bid for Freewest Resources (FWR-V). In November 2009, Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF-N), the world's largest iron ore pellet supplier, purchased Freewest Resources' share of the chromite-rich \\"high-grade Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy deposits in the remote \\"Ring of Fire\\" metals\\" for $240 million. In November 2009, Joseph Carrabba, Cliffs' president and CEO, claimed the \\"world- class deposits\\" had the \\"potential to support an open pit mine producing 1 to 2 million tonnes per year for more than thirty years\\". Carrabba announced that the ore would be \\"further processed into 400,000‚Äì800,000 tonnes of ferrochrome\\". The purchase was finalized in 2010.According to the Northern Miner article Cliff's 2009 acquisition included \\"Freewest's 100%-owned Black Thor and Black Label deposits, and 50% of its Big Daddy deposit, which Freewest has joint-ventured with Spider Resources (SPQ-V) and KWG Resources (KWG-V). Cliffs already owns 19.9% of KWG Resources, which holds a 25% stake in the Big Daddy deposit.\\" According to Carrabba the area of the Ring of Fire that Cliffs acquired in 2009 represents one of the \\"premier chromite deposits in the world. Chromite is smelted to produce ferrochrome which is used globally in the production of stainless steel and is categorized as a strategic metal resource by many countries. In May 2012, Cliffs announced a \\"$3.3-billion investment to build a chromite mine, transportation corridor and processing facility in northern Ontario's Ring of Fire that would lead to a new generation of prosperity in the north, with thousands of jobs and new infrastructure\\". Cliffs announced that its ferrochrome smelter would be in the Sudbury area in Ontario. However, by 13 June, the Cleveland-based Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., one of the world‚Äôs leading mining companies, announced through Bill Boor, senior vice-president for Global Ferroalloys, a division of Cliffs, that it would put its $3.3-billion project, including the Comprehensive Assessment, on hold for one year pending results of negotiations between First Nations and Queen's Park.  First Nations and the Ring of Fire Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 forces the two companies to negotiate an impact benefit agreement with the nine First Nations that would \\"include certain assurances, including guarantees that a certain number of jobs will go to First Nations workers\\". The three First Nations most profoundly impacted by the two projects are Marten Falls First Nation, Webequie First Nation and Neskantaga First Nation.The Neskantaga First Nation is located at the headwaters of the Attawapiskat River, where Cliff's proposed open pit mine would be located.CBC 14 May 2012 Others on the edge of the Ring of Fire include Constance Lake First Nation (Chief Roger Wesley), Nibinamik First Nation, Aroland First Nation, Long Lake 58 First Nation, Ginoogaming First Nation, Eabametoong First Nation, Mishkeegogamang First Nation, and Constance Lake First Nation.They are represented by the Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN). NAN is a political territorial organization that represents the 50 First Nations that are part of the Treaty No. 9 area in Northern Ontario. At the provincial level, the community, tribal council and political territorial organization participate in a province-wide coordinating body, the Chiefs of Ontario. The Assembly of First Nations represents the community along with other First Nations organizations and councils as well as over 600 First Nations across Canada. Attawapiskat First Nation, Kashechewan First Nation and Fort Albany First Nation are on the outer ring. Discovery of diamonds by Victor Mine on Attawapiskat First Nation traditional land, was one of the catalysts to further exploration resulting in the discovery of chromite. In May 2011, Matawa Chiefs and their communities called for a Joint Environmental Assessment (EA) Review Panel.First Nations have a constitutional right to be consulted and accommodated by provincial and the federal governments. The federal government has a focus on streamlining review processes through 2012 changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act to avoid a repeat of the lengthy Northern Gateway Pipeline Project Joint Review Panel which had a broad mandate under both the National Energy Board Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act to \\"consider whether the Northern Gateway Pipeline Project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects and if it is in the public interest\\". The review process included multiple opportunities for the public and Aboriginal groups to provide input NEB. On October 13, 2011, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) proceeded with a Comprehensive Study Environmental Assessment that favours the mining industry without First Nations participation. On October 20, 2011, Matawa First Nations removed its support for the Ring of Fire development unless the federal government agreed to a joint review panel Environmental Assessment process that would allow First Nations communities in the area to have a voice in the assessment. In May 2019 Noront Resources announced that their ferrochrome smelter to process chromite extracted from the Ring of Fire in northwestern Ontario, would be located in Sault Ste. Marie as a home for its. However, $60-billion Ring of Fire, a project, has been stalled as the newly-elected Ford administration has ended all negotiations with the nine Matawa First Nations in whose territory the Ring of Fire is located. The goodwill that stemmed from the 2014 regional framework agreement between the province of Ontario and the Matawa tribal council had quickly \\"evaporated\\" by 2018, according to Elizabeth Atlookan, Eabametoong First Nation Chief as the newly elected Conservative government worked \\"to \\"divide and conquer\\" by moving forward with projects, like road construction, in a piecemeal fashion, absent consultation with all Matawa nations.\\" On June 12, 2012, Webequie First Nation Chief Cornelius Wabasse and Minister of Northern Development and Mines Rick Bartolucci signed an agreement that \\"commits Ontario to providing social, community and economic development supports for Webequie to help facilitate the community's involvement in the Ring of Fire\\". They \\"will work together on regional environmental monitoring and regional infrastructure planning\\". On February 4, 2013, Tony Clement acknowledged that the nine first First Nations on and off-reserve in the Ring of Fire area are some of the \\"most socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in all of Canada\\". In an interview with CBC on 27 June 2013, Les Louttit, the deputy grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, the group that represents the nine First Nations, argued that serious problems have been neglected for decades.

It is set in post- apocalyptic New York City. Plot After society was almost destroyed in a robot rebellion in 2033, the remnants are either slaves to the Dark One in the one city that remains or nomads in the outside world. Slaves either work to power the city or fight in death matches for the other slaves to watch and for the Dark One's entertainment. While the winner of these matches is promised a reward, they receive death instead. The games are used to weed out of the population the biggest and the strongest to prevent rebellion in New Terra, the last city on Earth. Just outside New Terra (New York City), Neo, a drifter from the atomic-blasted wastelands and his klutzy robot sidekick arrive at a factory where slaves labor to fuel the Dark One's Power Station. He meets Deeja (Nadine Hart), who convinces him to help rescue her father. Her father is a scientist (Michael Dowend) who has invented a device that can break the Dark One's control over the factory slaves. Gathering a motley crew of allies on the way, Neo and Deeja go to the Power Station to confront the Dark One's evil servants. They find her father has been overtaken by the Dark One and was beyond saving, forcing Neo to kill both the Dark One and Deeja's father. With the Dark One dead and the slaves are free, Deeja stays behind to continue her father's work while Neo returns to the wastelands with his robot sidekick.

History Elering was established on 1 November 1998 under the name of P√µhiv√µrk as an operating unit of the Estonian national power company Eesti Energia. On 1 April 2004, it became a private limited company, O√ú P√µhiv√µrk, as a subsidiary of Eesti Energia. On 10 June 2009, the company changed its name to Elering. To implement the EU 3rd energy package, the Government of Estonia decided on 28 August 2009 to go for an ownership unbundling and to buy out Elering from Eesti Energia. The transaction was concluded on 28 January 2010. On 2 February 2010, Elering signed an agreement with Nord Pool Spot to create the Nord Pool Spot Estlink price area, starting from 1 April 2010. On 25 February 2011, Elering was transformed to a public limited company, AS Elering. In November 2014, Elering entered to the natural gas transmission market by acquiring a majority stake in the holding company AS V√µrguteenus Valdus, an owner of EG V√µrguteenus (later renamed: Elering Gaas). EG V√µrguteenus was established in 2005 as a subsidiary of Eesti Gaas.

In November 2013, to implement the EU 3rd energy package EG V√µrguteenus was separated from Eesti Gaas. In June 2015, Elering acquired the stake which was owned by Gazprom, and in September 2015, Elering acquired the stake which was owned by Itera Latvija in AS V√µrguteenus Valdus shares. In December 2015, after acquiring shares owned by minority shareholders of AS V√µrguteenus Valdus Elering decided to merge Elering Gas and V√µrguteenus Valdus into Elering.

It was scheduled to start on the Port Townsend-Coupeville (Keystone) route in September 2010, but sea trials revealed excessive vibrations in the vessel's propulsion system. The ferry was christened by Governor Christine Gregoire and began service November 14, 2010. The vessel was named after the Klallam chief Chetzemoka, who was influential during the early European-American settlement of Port Townsend. The Chetzemoka began service to Vashon Island on January 23, 2012, replacing the now-retired on the Point Defiance-Tahlequah route. Design The Chetzemokas design is based on that of the , a ferry that is owned by The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority. The particular class has had some mechanical issues, causing some in Washington to question the use of the design. The Chetzemokas design is somewhat unusual for a Washington State Ferry, as the vessel has two elevators, multiple stairwells, and a smoke stack on the same side of the ferry, instead of being symmetrical, aside from having a single elevator on one side of a typical Washington State Ferry. This oddity in design has given the vessel a pronounced 1 degree list, causing some to call the vessel 'Eileen' (I Lean). When the boat is loaded, the list is not noticeable. The Chetzemoka is also the first \\"smaller scale\\" vessel to allow access to the \\"Texas Deck\\", the area on top of the vessel between pilot houses. Only the Super-class, Jumbo-class, and Jumbo Mark II-class ferries allow such access. The Chetzemoka is also the first vessel in the Washington State Ferries fleet to have a mezzanine deck, between the main passenger cabin and the car deck, which on one side is primarily configured to hold bicycles (instead of them being relegated to the car deck), and the other simply for passengers. These mezzanine decks are not connected, except via the main passenger cabin, allowing for a full clearance in the center of the vessel. After some time in service, ballast was added to the vessel correcting the stability issues.  Incidents  On December 4, 2016, the Chetzemoka collided with a smaller vessel, the \\"Nap Tyme\\" in Dalco Passage, in between Vashon Island and Point Defiance. Both vessels were fine with no risk of sinking, and no injuries occurred. On December 24, 2016 the captain of the Chetzmoka suffered a medical emergency and fell upon the controls causing the vessel to pull away from the dock while it was still tied up minutes from its scheduled departure. No damage was done to the vessel but the dock's apron was severely damaged shutting down the Point Defiance Terminal for a week.

Interchanges are with Columbus and Ohio River Railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. History Ohi-Rail Corporation traces its roots back to the predecessors of the New York Central System, who built the railroad to tap into the vast coal resources found in southeastern Ohio. The 34-mile line stretches south from the City of Minerva through the counties of Carroll, Harrison and Jefferson to Hopedale in southeastern Ohio. Along with the 3.8-mile Wolf Run Branch, this railroad, commonly known as the \\"Piney Fork Line,\\" cut a path through this coal-rich region of Ohio. The rail line thrived by transporting coal well into the late 1960s. With the last two mines ceasing regular operations in the late 1970s, Penn Central moved to abandon and remove the track. Looking to preserve the line, the Ohio Department of Transportation‚Äôs Division of Rail Transportation Development purchased the Piney Fork Line and its associated track in July 1982 and began looking for an operator. Ohi-Rail Corporation, a group of rail investors led by Teresa Schiappa stepped forward and signed an agreement with the ORDC to operate and preserve the Piney Fork Line. Ohi-Rail stepped up again in 1993 when Conrail decided to abandon Ohi-Rail's northern connection in Minerva. Ohi-Rail not only purchased the threatened line from Conrail, but also the additional track from Bayard into Minerva, including the Minerva Yard. In 2002, Ohi-Rail named Richard Delatore as Vice President. With little traffic being generated on the railroad, Ohi-Rail made a living storing rail cars in the Minerva Yard until rumors of a new natural resource boom began circulating around the communities the railroad served. Utica Shale then became the new lifeblood of the railroad, as wells using the latest technology in directional drilling and fracking methods began producing massive amounts of oil and natural gas liquids in the counties the railroad served. From pipe suppliers and frac sand distributors, to oil and gas liquids themselves, the railroad's business opportunities grew. Ohi-Rail moved quickly, and when a major frac sand distributor located on the railroad in Minerva, the railroad completely rebuilt the Minerva Yard to accommodate the projected increase in traffic. At that time, they also brought General Manager Denny Varian on board to handle operations with the added value of his background in the rail industry. The main line is being completely rehabilitated from Minerva south to tap into the vast industrial property reserves along the line. Along with the sand cars in the railyard, tank cars are being filled with natural gas liquids via trans-loading from trucks. After adding internal customer service and marketing departments headed by Desiree Dunlap and Sarah Ossman, the once coal-focused railroad is transforming itself to serve the energy development growth alongside other diverse industrial businesses in eastern Ohio. In late 2019 and early 2020, a deal was made to sell Ohi-Rail Corporation to the Genesee and Wyoming as a part of the Ohio Central System under the OC's subsidiary name Mahoning Valley Railway. The north end of the line, which interchanges mostly with NS at Bayard, deals mostly with storage cars now. The last two Ohi-Rail rostered locomotives, GP38s 5032 and 5045, reside in Minerva as of June 2020. The south end has trash trains to and from Apex, and OC locomotives from the southern lines use this end, as the north end is now cut off with car storage.https://www.gwrr.com/railroads/north_america/mahoning_valley_railway#m_tab- one-panel External links *HawkinsRails Ohi-Rail page References  Category:Ohio railroads ","title":"Ohi-Rail Corporation"},{"id":"26097993","text":"Caledonia Mountain is summit located in the Canadian Rockies on the shared border of Alberta and British Columbia in Canada.

It opened in 1904 to service steel mills in the Cleveland area. History The company was incorporated in 1899 as a subsidiary of the American Steel and Wire Company, a steel firm with several plants scattered throughout Cleveland. Construction began that year, and was complete in 1904. The line ran from the company's Central Furnaces (the area roughly bounded today by the Cuyahoga River, Interstate 490, and Broadway Avenue) and ran briefly south before crossing the Cuyahoga River at the now-demolished Jefferson Avenue Bridge. The track ran through the company's plant on the west side of the Cuyahoga, and recrossed the river near the now-demolished Clark Avenue Bridge. The line ran south (passing over Campbell Road and under Harvard Avenue) before turning east. After an at-grade crossing of E. 49th Street and the bridging of E. 71st Street, the tracks turned north at E. 76th Street into the company Newburgh Works, terminating at Aetna Road. American Steel and Wire merged with a number of other steel companies to form U.S. Steel in 1901. U.S. Steel consolidated the NSR with another subsidiary railroad, the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad, in 1951. Traffic on the road declined significantly after World War II, and largely ceased when U.S. Steel closed its Cuyahoga Works in 1984. The NSR sold of its main line to the Cuyahoga Valley Railway, and then closed on June 30, 1986. In July 1986, the track was sold to the Chicago West Pullman Transportation Co., now known as Omnitrax.

Coal The No 11 coal pit was near Dalmore Farm; Willie McIlwraith, a farmer there in later years, had a narrow escape when the shaft pit collapsed whilst he was ploughing over it. A Mowlum steam engine was used to sink the shaft in 1877 and this was later used at the Hone pit.Barber, Page 17 Hone stone Originally hone stones were taken from the riverbed, however as early as 1789 a quarry for whetstone existed on the estate, producing whetstones known either as 'Water-of-Ayr' stonePaterson, Page 713 or 'Tam o' Shanter' stone depending on their geological characteristics; The Hone Works themselves were situated west of the Stair Bridge.

This Smith is well known for his families involvement in the famous 'Mauchline ware'.Barber, Page 28 William Aiton in 1808 records that extensive use of hone took place at Gadgirth.Aiton, Page 53 The Laigh Dalmore mine was drained until about 1938 using a beam engine with a 20 ft. beam, supplied with steam by a Lancashire boiler.Tucker, Page 31 Three buildings made up the Dalmore Mill complex, one of which is two-storeys high and partly unroofed due to vandalism in 2003. The works finally closed circa 1990, although some stone was still being worked in 2000.Barber, Page 28 A suspension footbridge, dating from 1902, crosses the river to Milton Mill which was part of the complex.Scran Site Record. Accessed : 2010-02-06. A Mauchline Ware hone stone case The lade is still visible as a shallow ditch running from the river to the mill, a sluice originally controlling the water flow. A sizeable and unusual sculpture of a sheaf of corn with the name 'W Heron, 1821' is located on the mill wall, part of which was rebuilt after a German plane jettisoned incendiary bombs onto it in 1942. Dalmore holm and foundations of a structure beneath the mature trees The mill at Milton had originally been a woollen mill, opened on New Year's Day 1830 by Mr. Heron of Dalmore House and working until 1908.Barber, Page 19 William (1795‚Äì1847) and Andrew (1797‚Äì1869) Smith were sons of William Smith, a mason in Mauchline. In the 1820s it is recorded that the brothers were running a Hone stone factory at Milton Mill and it is thought that the Smith brothers diversified as Box Makers and established the famous Mauchline Ware manufacture in the village of Mauchline because they wished to have their own source of cases for their 'Water of Ayr Stones'.Mauchline Ware. Accessed : 2010-04-25 Milton Mill generated electricity for the works from 1935 to 1964 using a turbine until a flood wrecked the motors; a Boving turbine installed circa 1935 provided power to the mine, the machinery being in a separate building.Tucker, Page 35 In 1857 Dalmore Mill was described as 'A hone mill worked by water-10 horse power-two storeys high, slated and in good repair'. In later years Dalmore Mill housed the offices and stores.Barber, Page 27 The stone from the aforementioned Dalmore Quarry was dressed and polished at the mill which was the property of William Dun Esq. of Dalmore House at that time.RCAHMS Site Accessed : 2010-02-06. ;The Dalmore Waggonway The 1902 OS map shows a narrow gauge mineral railway running from Laigh Dalmore quarry to Dalmore Mill; a number of the old rails are stacked (2010) in the old quarry. The Victorian photograph of Enterkine shows the track in situ, although no railway sleepers are visible. Sidings may have been present. The gauge was 20 inch, the same as the tracks in the mine and the line was worked by horses until about 1945 when it was taken up and a horse and cart were used instead; later a lorry was employed.Tucker, Page 32 Saw mill A saw mill was present on the Dalmore Estate. Turnpikes The old Ayr to Stair turnpike runs past the entrance to Dalmore House and the milestone is still located on the roadside verge near the entrance to Dalmore. The old toll house still stands beside the road down to Stair. Views of the Tam o' Shanter Hone works The works had been owned by the Heron family and their successors of Dalmore House. The house was directly connected to Dalmore Mill by a lane.

On 22 July 1928 a Conventicle was held at Dalgarnock near Closeburn in Dumfries and Galloway to unveil and dedicate a Northumbrian style 'Martyrs Cross', Mr John Cuninghame Montgomerie of Dalmore performing the official unveiling. A large number of people were in attendance as were a large united choir and the regimental band of the 7th Battalion of the Cameronian Territorial Regiment, commanded by Lieut. Colonel Vandaluer. A religious service was held and several clergy of other denominations also participated. A number of descendants of the Covenanter martyrs were present, including several of the Harkness family. The reason for John Cuninghame Montgomerie being given the honour of unveiling the cross has yet to be ascertained. In 1883 Mrs Dunn of Dalmore presented Stair Church with two brass pulpit lamps which are still in perfect condition; later Mr Montgomerie gave two silver salvers to the church.Barber, Page 30 A number of groups of grind stones and unfinished hone stones were used as garden features around the old house. Old milestones were used to help protect the bridge piers from the scouring action of the river and these can still be seen at times of low water. David Wyper is on the 'Stair Role of Honour', having worked at the hone mill until he was old enough to joy the army in 1917. David was killed in 1918 at the battle of Flanders Field.Barber, Page 45 The hamlet of Stair lies next to the River Ayr and consists of the Stair Inn, old converted mills, Stair Church, and Stair House. Stair House, a late 16th / 17th century house lying beyond the church, was the birthplace of John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair. A category A listed building, it is still in use as a private dwelling. The name Stair, previously written 'Stahar' or 'Stayhar', may come from the Gaelic 'Stair', meaning stepping-stones or a path over a bog.Johnston, Page 272 In the 18th century, William Cunninghame of Enterkine held a F√™te champ√™tre below the house on the holm pictured in the view from the Dalmore House tower. Robert Burns recorded the event in one of his songs; William was apparently trying to impress the local landowners to increase his chances of being elected as MP for Ayrshire.Love (2005), Page 36 Laigh Dalmore was home to Jeanie Shaw's uncle. A noted centenarian, Jeanie married John Gibson at the farm. Jeanie had eleven children and had 207 lineal descendants at the time of her death.Mackie, Pages 74-75 In 1982 the works still employed 10 people. According to Mr K.B.C. Montgomery, the owner and last manager of the hone stone mine, interviewed at the site on 16 October 2010, the extant mine tubs in Dalmore Quarry were brought there a few years ago by the BBC for a television documentary about coal-mining during the nineteenth century. The wagons used in the hone stone mine were smaller and of a different type. For the documentary the broken waste stone dumped over the sides of the quarry was sprayed with black paint so that it looked like a huge stack of coal in the film. At the date of the interview there was a length of the stone mine track in situ beneath the grass leading from close to the mine shaft to the edge of the quarry, still present in 2010.

Early life Kokona was born on August 8, 1913, in Izmir, Turkey, to an Albanian intellectual family, originating from Gjirokastra, Albania. His father, Elmaz, was a lawyer and a judge of the Ottoman Empire. Upon the return of their family to Albania in 1920, he followed the primary school in Tirana. He finished in 1935 the lyceum of Korca, then pursued higher studies in law in Paris, France. Teaching years After his law studies Kokona was appointed to the Civil Court of Kruja, which office he did not accept. Subsequently, he was appointed as a teacher of Albanian in the Lyceum of Korca. There, Kokona was distinguished as a gifted teacher. Subsequently, in the early 1940s he was appointed at the Gymnasium of Tirana. During the fascist invasion, when Kokona worked as a teacher, he was required to spy on the students and to deal with work that he could not accept due to his principles and character.

Analysis Although the picture is held in great esteem and widely admired by critics and the public, doubt has been cast by art historians as to whether it is an actual Goya.Hughes, 25 If authentic then it is likely a portrait of either Rosario Weiss, or more likely, her mother Leocadia Weiss‚Äîthe artist's nurse during the last years of his life. Leocadia cared for Goya in exile in Bordeaux, where he settled to live among politically liberal friends.Hagen & Hagen, 95 Following his death, the painting was willed to his last child, Javier (b. 1784). Financial difficulties a year later forced him to sell it to Juan Bautista de Muguiro, a distant relative. Muguiro's descendants donated the work to the Museo del Prado in 1946, where it remains a popular exhibit at the gallery, despite doubts as to its origin. Rosario was later a painter, and it is sometimes claimed that she may have been the creator of this work. However, when compared to the relatively amateur works of hers held in the Academia de San Fernando, it is generally considered highly unlikely.Junquera, 21 See also * La Leocadia Notes Bibliography * Connell, Evan S.

He became the fourth athlete to die during preparations for a Winter Olympics, and the seventh athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games. Kumaritashvili, who first began to participate in luge when he was 13, came from a family of seasoned lugers: his grandfather had introduced the sport to the Soviet republic of Georgia, and both his father and uncle had competed when they were younger, with his uncle later serving as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation. Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the 2008‚Äì09 Luge World Cup. He had also been a student at the Georgian Technical University, where he earned an economics degree in 2009.  Life and career  Kumaritashvili was born on 25 November 1988, in Borjomi, Georgian SSR, present-day Georgia, to David and Dodo Kumaritashvili. He had one sister, Mariam, who was four years younger. Kumaritashvili's family had a long association with luge. His grandfather Aleko Kumaritashvili introduced luge to Georgia after first training for it in East Germany. Aleko helped build a primitive luge run in Bakuriani in 1970; a more finished track, funded by the Soviet authorities, was built in 1973. Kumaritashvili's uncle and coach, Felix Kumaritashvili, served as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation, and his father, David, won a USSR Youth Championship when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union, and was a three-time champion at the Spartakiad, once in two-man bobsled and twice in luge. Kumaritashvili grew up in nearby Bakuriani, which is known for its many ski slopes. He enjoyed several winter sports and started luge when he was 13 years old. While attending the Georgian Technical University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2009, Kumaritashvili maintained a rigorous training and competition schedule. Though his family endured economic hardship, Kumaritashvili attended as many luge events as he could, often driving for days to reach World Cup events. As a devout member of the Georgian Orthodox Church, he prayed at church before every competition. During his first season of competition, Kumaritashvili finished 55th out of 62 competitors at the 2008‚Äì09 Luge World Cup, where he was entered in four races. He finished 28th out of 32 competitors at the 2009‚Äì10 Luge World Cup event at Cesana Pariol in January, which was his fifth and last World Cup event. At the time of his death, he was ranked 44th out of 65 competitors in the 2009‚Äì10 World Cup season and was regarded as one of the best lugers to come from Georgia. By 31 December 2009, the cut-off date for luge qualifications for the Olympics, Kumaritashvili was ranked 38th overall. He qualified for the luge men's singles event at the 2010 Winter Olympics, his Olympic debut, by racing in five World Cup races over two years.  Olympic luge track  The venue for the Olympic luge competition, the Whistler Sliding Centre, was designed by Udo Gurgel and his firm, Ingenieurburo Gurgel (IBG) of Leipzig, with the final version produced on 23 October 2004. Using the specified track dimensions for a variety of sled entrance and exit trajectories, IBG calculated the speeds and G forces along each curve of the track. The new curve configurations, rather than the speed, were expected to provide the main challenge. The maximum calculated speed for men's luge was . In February 2005, concerns arose regarding the difficulties posed by Cesana Pariol, the track built for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Several serious crashes occurred, prompting calls for physical modifications to that track. The International Luge Federation (FIL) was concerned that similar modifications might be required at the Whistler track and communicated these concerns to the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) in March 2005. Uncertainty about the track design persisted into 2006 until the scheduled start of track construction, when it was determined that construction would be based on the original design. After construction, during the track homologation (certification) process, the track produced speeds exceeding the design calculations by at least . Following the Olympic test event in February 2009, Josef Fendt, president of FIL, sent a letter to IBG expressing surprise that a record speed of had been reached, concluding that the designer's calculations were incorrect, and stating that the high speed \\"makes me worry.\\" The letter also said that \\"overstepping this limit would be an absolute unreasonable demand for the athletes.\\" He asked IBG to respond, in particular with regard to the future Sochi Olympic track. Fendt also informed VANOC that the Whistler track was not supplied as ordered. VANOC, however, concluded that no action was required regarding the Whistler track, since the focus of Fendt's letter to IBG was the new Sochi track. In April 2009, IBG explained that the differences between the calculated and actual observed speeds were caused by new sled technology that reduced drag coefficients and ice friction coefficients. Because of the secrecy inherent in sled development, the IBG engineers had difficulty obtaining the latest sled specifications required for their engineering calculations. In the view of the Games organizers, the high speeds and technical challenges could be safely mitigated by imposing additional practice and graduated training requirements on the athletes.  Accident and death  Spectators at the Whistler Sliding Centre look down the track as sliders pass the point where Kumaritashvili crashed. On 12 February 2010, after 25 previous attempts, 15 of them from the men's start, Kumaritashvili was fatally injured in a crash during his final training run, after losing control in the last turn of the course. He was thrown off his luge and over the sidewall of the track, striking an unprotected steel support pole at the end of the run. He was travelling at the moment of impact. Medics were at Kumaritashvili's side immediately after the crash. Both cardio-pulmonary and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation were performed. He was airlifted to a Whistler hospital, where he died of his injuries. It was luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger had been killed. Kumaritashvili became the fourth athlete to die during preparations for a Winter Olympics, after British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and Australian skier Ross Milne (both 1964 Innsbruck), and Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay (1992 Albertville). He was also the 16th participating athlete to die during or in practice for a Summer or Winter Olympic Games.  Mourning  After footage of Kumaritashvili's death was televised, there was shock and mourning in Georgia. In response to the accident, the Georgian team announced that it would consider skipping the opening ceremonies or withdrawing from the games entirely, but Nika Rurua, the Georgian minister for sports and culture, later announced the team would stay in Vancouver and \\"dedicate their efforts to their fallen comrade\\". During the opening ceremony, the seven remaining members of the Georgian Olympic team wore black armbands, bore the Georgian flag with a black ribbon tied to it, and left a space vacant in the procession, as marks of respect. Upon entering BC Place Stadium, the Georgian team was greeted with a standing ovation from the assembled crowd. The team left the stadium immediately after the procession. Georgian athletes during the opening ceremony Later, during the opening ceremonies, a moment of silence was held to honour Kumaritashvili's memory, and both the Canadian and Olympic flags were lowered to half-staff. Fellow teammate and luger Levan Gureshidze, who was to compete with Kumaritashvili, withdrew after the crash, telling teammates that he \\"couldn't go on\\", and went home to attend the funeral. The lugers who stayed to compete all wore a black stripe on their helmets in honour of Kumaritashvili. Early in the morning of 17 February 2010, Kumaritashvili's body arrived in Tbilisi. It reached his hometown of Bakuriani later that day. Thousands of Georgians attended a funeral feast for him on 19 February, and he was buried on Saturday, 20 February, at the church he had attended. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili attended the funeral service dressed in a Georgian Olympic uniform. In Bakuriani, the street of Kumaritashvili's childhood home was renamed in his honour. Felix Loch of Germany, who won the gold medal in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal melted down and refashioned into two disks, giving one, etched with an image of Kumaritashvili and the years of his birth and death, to Kumaritashvili's parents. In spite of several donations of money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was hard on them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to fix a meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple hospital stays.  Emergency safety measures  The wall that was installed just past the final turn of the Whistler Sliding Centre after the death of Kumaritashvili The FIL stated that Kumaritashvili's death \\"was not caused by an unsafe track\\", but as a preventive measure, the walls at the exit of curve16 were raised, and the ice profile was adjusted. Padding was also added to exposed metal beams near the finish line. Olympic officials claimed the changes were \\"not for safety reasons but to accommodate the emotional state of the lugers\\". In addition, the start of the men's luge was moved to the women's starting point, to reduce speed, while the start of the women's luge was also moved farther down the track. Training runs on the track resumed on 13 February, after the changes to the track were finished. Three lugers, including the departed Gureshidze, did not participate in any training runs on that day.  International Luge Federation report  On 19 April 2010, the FIL published its final report to the International Olympic Committee on Kumaritashvili's death. The report found that the sled used by Kumaritashvili had met all FIL standards. It attributed the accident to \\"driving errors starting in curve 15/16 which as an accumulation ended in the impact that resulted in him leaving the track and subsequently hitting a post.... This is a tragic result that should not have occurred as a result of an initial driving error\\". As the sled hit the wall at the curve-16 exit, it catapulted off the track, causing Kumaritashvili to lose control of it entirely. This was a type of accident not seen before, and therefore \\"[w]ith the unknown and unpredictable dynamics of this crash, the calculation and construction of the walls in that section of the track did not serve to prevent the tragedy that happened\\". However, the report also determined that during the homologation process and later sessions at the Whistler Sliding Centre, the track was faster than originally calculated. Instead of the expected , the highest speed recorded was . The FIL felt that luge athletes were able to cope with this speed, but \\"this was not a direction the FIL would like to see the sport head [in]\\". FIL President Fendt wrote to the Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee that the FIL would homologize the proposed Sochi track only if speeds did not exceed . The FIL also said it was \\"determined\\" to do what it could to prevent such accidents from occurring again. It would re- examine changes to the sport, sled design, and track technology. FIL Secretary General Svein Romstad summarized: \\"What happened to Nodar has been an unforeseeable fatal accident\\".  Coroner's report  Whistler, 2010 The British Columbia coroner's office investigated the incident. It was reported to be considering, among other pieces of evidence, written complaints about the safety of the Whistler track by Venezuelan luger Werner Hoegerwho crashed on the track on 13 November 2009, suffering a severe concussionand information suggesting that the track was constructed in such a narrow and steep location, near the Whistler and Blackcomb mountains, for commercial reasons. The track designer, Udo Gurgel, said: \\"The track had to be near Whistler, for use after the Olympics. You don't want to ruin an investment so the track is on terrain that's a little steep.\\" According to John Furlong, the chief executive of the 2010 Winter Olympics organizing committee, proposals to build the sliding centre on Grouse Mountain near Vancouver were rejected early in the bid phase due to reservations expressed by the international luge, and the bobsled and skeleton, federations. In a report dated 16 September 2010, the coroner ruled Kumaritashvili's death an accident brought on by an \\"interaction of factors\\", including the high speed of the track, its technical difficulty, and the athlete's relative unfamiliarity with the track. He wrote that during Kumaritashvili's training runs, it was reasonable to assume that \\"Mr.Kumaritashvili was sliding faster than ever before in his life, and was attempting to go even faster, while simultaneously struggling to learn the intricacies of the track and the dynamics it created\\". The coroner accepted that luging would always carry an element of risk and that the best practices known at the time had been followed in the construction of the Whistler track. He also called upon the FIL to require athletes to engage in more mandatory training sessions prior to the Olympic Games and other major competitions. 2010 Georgian postal stamp commemorating Kumaritashvili The coroner also commented, \\"The organizers, regulatory bodies and venue owners must ensure that no effort is spared to anticipate the unforeseeable as far as safety is concerned,\\" and to \\"err on the side of caution, insisting on more, rather than less.\\" Responding to the report, Kumaritashvili's father said: \\"I don't accept the statement about Nodar's lack of experience. He wouldn't have won the right to take part in the Olympics if he lacked experience.\\".  Mont Hubbard report  In 2013, Mont Hubbard, a University of California, Davis, mechanical and aerospace professor, issued a report claiming that Kumaritashvili's crash was probably caused by a \\"fillet\\", a joint between the lower edge of the curve and a vertical wall. Hubbard suggested that the right runner of Kumaritashvili's sled rose up the fillet, launching him into the air. Terry Gudzowsky, the president of ISC/IBG Group, a consortium involved in the construction of the Whistler track, dismissed Hubbard's theory as \\"flawed\\", stating that the data to replicate the ice surface at the site of the accident in three dimensions do not exist. The luge track built for use at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was designed with two uphill sections to reduce speeds, and for runs about slower than the Whistler track.

In his six decades of ministry, he hosted the Good News Today program, who was also best known for his mass- miracle ministry to millions. Biography Tommy Lee Osborn was born on December 23, 1923, on the small family potato farm, in Grady County, Oklahoma. He was the seventh and youngest son of thirteen children, born to Charles Richard Osborn (1883-1966) and his wife Mary (n√©e Brown) (1885-1951). His father, also a seventh son, was a nonpracticing traditional Baptist, \\"That's supposed to mean something,\\" Osborn once commented, adding \\"Turns out, it did mean something.\\" His parents were musicians, as were several of his brothers and sisters, and Tommy Lee started making music at a very young age. Growing up in the latter half of the 1920s, he saw his large family struggling through the depression years. In 1930, when Osborn was six years old, his father moved the family to Skedee, Oklahoma, in search of another, more profitable farm. At a church in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, he met future televangelist Oral Roberts, who would become his lifelong friend for over 70 years, until Roberts's death in 2009. Osborn frequently went with Roberts to help with evangelical meetings. Roberts did most of the preaching, Osborn did everything else, including playing the accordion and the piano for the musical part of the meetings. Osborn had experienced a Christian conversion in 1937, at the age of 13, when his older brother took him to a Pentecostal church in Mannford. Gradually, each of his six brothers moved out of the family home until TL was the only boy still living with his parents and helping his 60-year-old father on the potato farm. He admitted that he was reluctant, even scared, to ask his father's permission to move out and begin traveling. Finally, while sorting potatoes in the cellar, he plucked up courage to make the request and was greatly surprised when his father said \\"yes.\\" In 1939, aged 15, Osborn was milking the cows when he began to cry. He fell on his knees, praying and asking God what was happening. The Lord, he said, called him to be an evangelist, while he laughed and cried at the same time, overwhelmed by what was happening to him. He dropped out of high school after completing eighth grade and hit the road with E.M. Dillard, a traveling evangelist. Osborn was responsible for organising evangelistic meetings and was also in charge of youth services in the evening. He traveled with Dillard through three states. The last one was California, and he met Daisy Washburn, in Los Banos, California at one of the meetings. It was 1941 and he was only 17 when he fell instantly in love. On April 5, 1942, Osborn married graduating high school student and farmer's girl, Daisy Washburn Osborn (born September 23, 1924 in Merced, California). He was 18, and she was only 17. Shortly thereafter, they set out on a life of ministry and missionary travel, including a trip to India when Osborn was still only 21. In time, they carried the Gospel of Christ to tens of millions of people all over the world, declaring it with faith and confidence. However, that early mission in India, preaching at Lucknow, was not fruitful. Their ministry lasted less than a year in India, and they returned home because of critical family sickness. In 1947, the Osborns had their only daughter, LaDonna Osborn (b. March 13 of that year; she was raised accompanying her parents on the platforms of global mass miracle evangelistic crusades. The Osborns first gained public notice shortly after returning from India, as evangelists on the Big Tent Revival circuit in the United States and Canada. There, they preached to audiences often numbering over 10,000, in open-air meetings and under large tents in settings such as fairgrounds and stadiums. Other young contemporary evangelists, including Oral Roberts, Billy Graham, Jack Coe, R.W. Schambach and A.A. Allen, were also on the circuit. The Osborns emphasized the love and compassion of God, rather than the \\"fire and brimstone\\" commonly used by evangelists of the era, and they practiced supernatural healing in their meetings. The Osborn's egalitarian ministry philosophy was also not accepted by many conservative audiences. By the early 1950s, their emphasis began to shift more and more toward international missions. They held large crusades in Latin America, Asia, and Africa and crowds grew rapidly, at times exceeding 100,000. After Osborn's crusades in Thailand in 1956 and Uganda in 1957, Pastor Fred Wantaate of Makerere Full Gospel Church said that \\"after that crusade in Mombasa, the fountain of the river of Pentecostalism spread in the heart of East Africa\\". Around that same time, he met another future televangelist, Marilyn Hickey, eight years Osborn's junior, with her new husband, Wallace. The young couple traveled around in her husband's car, conducting tent revival meetings in various towns. Together, Osborn and Hickey prayed for the sick and she became a guest speaker at his conferences. He was lifelong friends with her family until his death just four months after Hickey lost her husband, Wallace. Over the course of the next five decades, Osborn and his team traveled to more than 70 countries including Kenya where Apostle Dr Joe Kayo got born again in his Crusade in 1957(Joe Kayo later turned to be a great pioneer of Pentecostal movement in East Africa) and reached millions of people. They created prolific quantities of evangelistic and training materials, some of which were translated into more than 80 languages. Osborn's wife of 53 years, Daisy Osborn, died in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on May 27, 1995, at age 70. Thereafter, he continued to travel and conduct crusades around the world for another 15 years. Osborn died on February 14, 2013, at the age of 89. According to his daughter, LaDonna, he had been in good health until his body began weakening just a few days before he stopped breathing. He was interred next to his wife at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma (the same cemetery where Oral Roberts had been interred nearly four years earlier). Osborn was survived by his daughter, three of four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. LaDonna Osborn continues to operate the ministry founded by her parents, including leading international crusades in the developing world every year. His grandson Tommy Ray O'Dell, has also followed in his grandfather's footsteps and has a ministry focused on evangelism and education in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Like his grandfather, he often draws large crowds and it has been claimed that miracles have taken place in his services.

The raid succeeded in killing Ra√∫l Reyes, second-in-command of FARC, as well as some two dozen individuals present in the encampment, including an Ecuadorian citizen and four Mexicans, allegedly research students invited to the camp after attending a Bolivarian congress in Quito. In the aftermath of the attack, a diplomatic crisis emerged between Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. Raid In the week before the incursion, it was revealed that the Colombian government, with assistance from the United States' FBI and DEA, had wiretapped several satellite phones that were used by FARC forces in Southern Colombia. According to an unnamed Colombian military source, an international call made by Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez to Ra√∫l Reyes on one of these phones was intercepted by authorities on February 27. The source claimed that Ch√°vez called Reyes to inform him that the release of three FARC hostages held captive for almost 7 years had been completed, and the intercepted call was then used to track Reyes to a location in Colombia, near the Ecuadorian border. Colombian troop movements from Cali to the border area began on February 29. On March 1, 2008 at 00:25 local time (0525 UTC), Colombia launched a military operation, into Ecuador. Colombian intelligence reports indicated that Ra√∫l Reyes was expected to stay near Angostura, Ecuador, for the night of February 29, 2008. On and after February 27, several members of FARC 48th Front were captured by Colombian security forces near the Ecuadorian border, taking away some support from the main group. During the subsequent operation, the Colombian Air Force stormed Angostura, followed by a Colombian special forces group and members of the Colombian National Police. According to Colombian authorities, the guerrillas responded to the initial bombardment from a position in the vicinity of Santa Rosa de Yanamaru, on the Ecuadorian side of the border, killing Colombian soldier Carlos Hern√°ndez. A second bombardment was then carried out, resulting in the deaths of Ra√∫l Reyes and at least 20 more FARC members. Two bodies, several documents and three laptops found in the guerrilla camp were returned to Colombia. This was the first time the Colombian military had killed a member of FARC's leadership council in combat. After the operation, Colombian authorities increased security measures nationwide fearing FARC retaliation. According to the Ecuadorian government, the attack happened inside its territory, lacked its permission, and was a planned strike, intended to be followed by the incursion of Colombian troops by helicopter. It pointed out that the attack had left a total of more than 20 guerrillas and others dead in Ecuadorian territory, many of them found wearing underwear or sleeping clothes. Ecuador's government concluded that the attack was a \\"massacre\\" and not the result of combat or \\"hot pursuit\\". Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa estimated that the war planes penetrated 10 km into Ecuador's territory and struck the guerrilla camp while flying north, followed by troops in helicopters who completed the killings. He noted that some of the bodies had been found to be shot from behind. Ecuadorian authorities found three wounded women in the camp, including a Mexican student identified as Luc√≠a Andrea Morett √Ålvarez. Luc√≠a Morett claimed she was visiting the guerrilla group as part of an academic investigation, refusing to answer other questions about her time among them. Regarding the attack on the camp, she has stated: \\"I was asleep when we received a first aerial attack. Two or three hours later we were attacked again\\". Ecuador was investigating together with Mexico whether Mexicans were killed during the raid. According to the director of the Ecuadorian military hospital which treated the three women, they had received some sort of medical attention from both the attacking Colombian forces and the Ecuadorian soldiers who found them later.

The soldiers claimed they were receiving fire from the crowd, whereas the civilians said they were shot at first. Human Rights Watch, which inspected the area after the incident, found no physical evidence of shots fired at the building where U.S. forces were based. History On the evening of April 28, 2003, several hundred civilians ignored a curfew imposed on them by the U.S. military. They proceeded to march through the streets of Fallujah, past the soldiers positioned in the Ba'ath party headquarters. They wished to protest outside a local school about the United States military presence within. A U.S. Army Psychological Operations team attempted to force the civilians to disperse with announcements, but the team failed in this attempt. According to locals, at this point the United States soldiers fired upon the unarmed crowd, killing 17 and wounding more than 70 of the protesters. The U.S. suffered no casualties from the incident. According to the soldiers on the ground, the 82nd Airborne soldiers inside the school responded to \\"effective fire\\" from inside the protesting crowd. Human Rights Watch found no evidence that the US forces had come under attack and it concluded that the US forces, far from shooting with precision, shot at Iraqis indiscriminately. Two days later, on April 30, the 82nd Airborne was replaced in the city by 2nd Troop (Fox) / U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. The 3rd Cavalry was significantly smaller in number and chose not to occupy the same schoolhouse where the shooting had occurred two days earlier. However, on the same day three more unarmed civilians were killed by United States soldiers during a daytime protest in front of the Ba'ath party headquarters and mayor's office (which are adjacent to one another; known collectively to U.S. forces as FOB Laurie). Once again, the U.S. suffered no casualties from the incident but some U.S. soldiers were hurt in a retaliatory grenade attack on the Ba'ath headquarters later that evening. Legacy The incident is frequently cited and compared to other similar incidents. Foreign Policy compared Fallujah to the 2010 Israeli Gaza flotilla raid during which Israeli naval commandos used lethal force to kill nine activists, some shot when they had their backs turned to the Israeli soldiers.

Plot At the end of the American Civil War, Confederate soldier Tom Dooley (Landon) leads an attack on a stagecoach, unaware that the war was already over. Dooley is declared to be a murderer but he returns to his hometown hoping to marry his fianc√©e, Laura Foster (Morrow). Trouble soon breaks out and he and Laura are forced to elope, pursued by lawman Charlie Grayson (Hogan) who also has romantic interest in Laura. Tom and Laura get married and attempt to escape to Tennessee, but are soon captured by Grayson. Dooley is locked up in the town jail after a quick trial where he is sentenced to be hanged in the morning, but escapes with the help of one of his confederate army friends, \\"Country Boy\\".

The band lasted from 1979 to 1983. The group has retained a certain aura to this day in France's punk circles due to their complete lack of compromise and influence on the French DIY scene. Sometime after the disband of Lucrate Milk, some of the former members formed the band B√©rurier Noir and Les N√©gresses Vertes.

He is an emeritus professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, senior scientist emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution, and visiting scientist at the American Museum of Natural History Center for Biodiversity and Conservation. He studies threats and solutions to human impacts on the environment and the ecology and evolution of tropical seas. Jackson has more than 170 scientific publications and 11 books, with nearly 40,000 citations listed on Google Scholar. He is a powerfully engaging public speaker and has lectured widely about the environmental crisis, including his TED talk ‚ÄúHow we wrecked the oceans‚Äô that has been viewed over half a million times. Jackson is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has received more than a dozen prizes and awards including the BBVA International Prize in Ecology and Conservation, the Paleontological MedalPaleontological Society Medal, and the Darwin Medal of the International Society for Reef Studies. Jackson‚Äôs work on the collapse of coastal ecosystems was chosen by Discover magazine as the outstanding scientific achievement of 2001. His new book Breakpoint: Tending to America‚Äôs Environmental Crises, released by Yale in April 2018. Biography Jackson was born in Louisville, Kentucky but had moved to New York City by the age of one. He grew up in Miami, Florida and Washington, D.C.. He completed his bachelor in zoology at George Washington University. He received his Ph.D. in geology from Yale University in 1971. Jeremy Jackson is married to Nancy Knowlton. They met in the Caribbean and married in 1983. They have one daughter, Rebecca. Jackson also has a son, Stephen, from a previous marriage. Jackson lives in New York City and Brooksville, Maine where he guest reads to elementary school students about environmental issues in Maine. Career Dr. Jackson started his career as a marine biologist studying the distribution of bryozoans and their behavior. His work on marine bryozoans provided some of the strongest evidence to date for the controversial punctuated equilibrium model of evolutionary change. In addition to the bryozoan work, Jackson produced influential studies on coral reef communities and served as a central figure in a Smithsonian Institution investigation of ecosystems in Panama and the surrounding regions. Jackson also studied the impact of Hurricane Allen on reefs in Jamaica. The resulting paperhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ff96/4322290aacae5476893c5ac05bff00f6e3e2.pdf confidently predicted recovery of the reef. A few years later, in Jamaica Jackson led a study concerning the impact of an oil spill on the nearshore regions affected. The result: corals affected by the spill died, but so did others, outside the stressed region. The reason for lack of recovery inside impacted regions and deterioration outside such regions, Jackson decided, was human activity. Concerned about the increasing effect of human impacts on marine ecosystems, Jackson created what is now known as \\"historical ecology\\" of marine ecosystems. Using historical and ecological sources, Jackson demonstrated that green sea turtles in the pre-Columbian Caribbean used to exist by the tens of millions, greater than current populations. After that first attempt at understanding what pristine marine ecosystems looked like, Jackson assembled an international team of ecologists, anthropologists, archeologists, and historians, to reconstruct marine ecosystem dynamics from the last several hundred years. The first result of this interdisciplinary working group was a paperhttp://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2011/pdf/jackson_2001.pdf led by Jackson showing that fishing predated any other major disturbance to marine ecosystems in the Holocene. This paper was chosen as the most important contribution of the year 2001 by Discover Magazine. It is, so far, the most cited paper coming out of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara, and one of the most cited papers in marine ecology. Jackson also led the definitive assessmenthttps://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf for the International Coral Reef Initiative of the declining status and trends of Caribbean coral reef ecosystems over last 50 years. Jeremy B.C. Jackson is also the founder of the Panama Paleontology Project which uses paleontology and geology to unravel the evolution of Caribbean marine ecosystems over the past 10 million years, in response to the emergence of the Central American Isthmus which isolated the Caribbean from the Pacific and changed global climate. He was also the Ocean Biology Deputy Editor for the journal Science Advances, served on the NOAA Scientific Advisory Board and the World Wildlife Fund USA National Board, and currently serves on Board of the Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies. Public Lectures and Media In addition to his positions as a researcher and educator, as a public lecturer Jackson has spoken in regards to the \\"brave new ocean,\\" where clear and productive coastal seas turn into oxygen-starved dead zones, and thriving food webs degrade to seas of slime and disease. He has spoken to the United States Senate about ocean issues and held conference at the U.S. Naval War College on the degradation of the ocean environment and its implications for human wellbeing and US national security. He is also a proponent of the shifting baseline concept and spoke at the Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project's Hollywood Ocean Night in 2004. Jeremy B.C. Jackson was also a featured scientist in the Leonardo DiCaprio film The 11th Hour.http://11thhouraction.com/ideasandexperts/jeremyjackson  Select Publications  * Publications by Jeremy Jackson *Jackson JBC (2008) Evolution and extinction in the brave new ocean.

He was born on 23 November 1864 at Poissy, Yvelines, and died on 23 December 1939 in Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes. Laubeuf was a pioneer in the design and building of submarines, and was responsible for a number of the innovations that led to modern submarine design. His work had a profound influence on the design of submersibles in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Laubeuf studied at the Ecole Polytechnique, and after graduating in 1883, he joined ENSTA, the French military's school of Marine Engineering. He became an Assistant Engineer in 1887, and Engineer in 1891. During this time, he worked at Brest on the development of submersibles and designs for the first modern submarines in 1904. Two years later, he left the Navy to continue building submarines in private industry. In 1896, the French government staged a design competition for a submarine of advanced capabilities. They required a 200-ton vessel with a surface speed of 12 knots and a 100-mile range, with a submerged speed of 6 knots and a 10-mile range. Laubeuf's design, Narval, was the winner out of 29 entries. Laubeuf determined that to run efficiently on the surface and submerged his submarine would need two separate power systems; most designers up to that point had tried to find a single system for both, with mixed success. The high surface speed demanded made a steam system necessary for surface running, while using an electric motor underwater. He also arranged to use the surface engine to re-charge the batteries for the electric motor whilst on the surface. Laubeuf also tackled the stability problem that beset submarine designs. The rounded pressure hull necessary to withstand the pressure at depth was a poor shape for sailing, making them unhandy on the surface and unstable submerged. Laubeufs's design had a double hull; an inner, rounded, reinforced hull to resist pressure, and an outer, boat-shaped hull to make the vessel seaworthy. These innovations were a leap forward in submarine design, and were adopted by navies around the world.Miller p116 Laubeuf became a member of the French Naval Academy and was elected member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1920.

Slutskin (1891‚Äì1950) was a Ukrainian scientist and professor who had a major role in shaping radio science in the Soviet Union. He was a pioneer in cavity magnetron development and the application of these devices in radio- location (radar) systems. Slutzkin, a native of Borisoglebsk, entered the Kharkov University (KU) in 1910. He received the Kandidat Nauk (Candidate of Science ‚Äì approximately equivalent to the PhD degree) from the Physics- Mathematics Department in 1916, and remained there as a docent and researcher during the turbulent times of the Russian Revolution. In 1921, prominent physicist Dmitry Rozhansky started a research department of physics at KU. Slutskin joined this activity as soon as it was formed. Rozhansky had a strong interest in high-frequency electromagnetic oscillations, and influenced Slutskin to begin research in this area. The earlier work on magnetrons by Albert Hull (American), August ≈Ω√°ƒçek (Czech), and Erich Habann (German) was studied and improved, resulting in devices generating oscillations with wavelengths between 300 and 40 cm.,Slutskin, Abram A., and Dmitry S. Shteinberg, [\\"Obtaining oscillations in cathode tubes with the aid of a magnetic field\\"], Zhurnal Russkogo Fiziko-Khimicheskogo Obshchestva'‚Äô [Journal of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society'‚Äô], vol. 58, no. 2, pp. 395-407 (1926)Slutskin, Abram A., and Dmitry S. Shteinberg, [\\"Electronic oscillations in two-electrode tubes\\"],Ukrainski Fizychni Zapysky'‚Äô [Ukrainian Journal of Physics], vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 22-27 (1927) (It is noted that Shteinberg was the supervisor of the research unit, and, by custom, his name was added as such.) During 1928-1930, Slutskin studied in Germany under Heinrich Barkhausen at the Dresden Technische Hochschule. While there, he published another important paper on magnetrons in Annalen der Physik, a highly respected and widely read German journal.Slutzkin, A. A., and D. S. Shteinberg, \\"Die Erzeugung von kurzwelligen unged√§mpften Schwingungen bei Anwendung des Magnetfeldes\\" [\\"The generation of undamped shortwave oscillations by application of a magnetic field\\"], Annalen der Physik, vol. 393, no. 5, pp. 658-670 (May 1929) In 1928-1929, the Ukrainian Physico-Technical Institute (UPTI) was established as a Soviet research organization in Kharkov.‚ÄùHistory of Research in Ukraine; Part III: Between the World Wars\\" http://www.cam.org/~ahryck/ukugmtl/bakai01.html#III . (The Institute was later renamed Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, but the original name is used herein.) The primary staff, including Ivan V. Obreimov, the director, was transferred from the Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute (LPTI), but the UPTI shared many senior personnel with KU. Upon his return from Germany, Slutskin was awarded the D.Sc. degree from KU, elevating him to the rank of professor. He was also added to the UPTI staff, heading a newly formed Laboratory of Electromagnetic Oscillations (LEMO). Here he continued with the development of magnetrons and other ultra-high-frequency (UHF) devices. At KU, his students included Aleksandr S. Usikov, Semion Y. Braude, and Ivan D. Truten, all of whom would later make major contributions in this field at the LIPT. Under Slutskin's leadership, research at the LEMO resulted in water- cooled magnetrons generating continuous power up to 17 kW at 80 cm, and a magnetron tunable over a 30 percent wavelength variation (only reported much later).Slutskin, A. A., S. Y. Braude, and I. D. Truten; \\"Obtaining High-Power Oscillations of the dm-Band [L-Band, 15-30 cm] in Continuous-Wave Magnetrons\\", Radiotekhnika'‚Äô, vol. 1, no. 9, pp. 12-17 (1946) (in Russian) Research was also performed on frequency control and pulsed modulation. Work on magnetrons and their applications was also underway at the LIPT, and the LEMO supplied their products to researchers in Leningrad. The development of the L-Band (15‚Äì30 cm, 2‚Äì1 GHz) magnetron gained the attention of the Technical Department of the Red Army. The UPTI was tasked to investigate magnetrons for use in radio-location (radar) units. From this, an un-cooled magnetron was developed that generated pulsed power up to 60 kW at 60 to 65 cm. In March 1937, the LEMO started an internally funded project to develop a pulsed, electromagnetic, gun-aiming system. Slutskin was responsible for the overall project under the code name Zenit, the name of a popular football team at that time. Development of the pulsed, L-band transmitter was under Usikov, and Braude designed a superheterodyne receiver using a low-power magnetron as the local oscillator. This system, with transmitting and receiving antennas separated by about 50 m, was first tested in October 1938, detecting an aircraft at 3 km in its first version. The receiver of the initial Zenit system was not sufficiently sensitive, and was redesigned by Truten using a 955 acorn triode from RCA. In September 1940, Slutskin demonstrated the revised Zenit to the Red Army and Red Navy, detecting aircraft at ranges up to 25 km. This was the first full three-coordinate, radio-location system in the Soviet Union. However, the time required to measure the coordinates (distance, azimuth, and elevation) was too long for gun-laying in anti-aircraft batteries. Although not accepted by the military, the Zenit did show the way for further developments.Kostenko, Alexei A., Alexander I, Nosich, and Irina A. Tishchenko; \\"Development of the First Soviet Three-Coordinate L-Band Pulsed Radar in Kharkov Before WWII\\", IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, vol. 43, no. 3, June 2001, pp. 29-48 While the Zenit was being developed, there was major discord within the UPTI. The radio-location work at the LEMO was conducted in great secrecy, and other units of the UPTI objected to the lack of \\"freedom of scientific knowledge\\". It was also learned that LEMP scientists were paid substantially more than other UPTI professionals. This resulted in a push to have LEMP become a totally separate organization. At this same time, Joseph Stalin's Great Purge swept the nation, and the UPTI was a target. Many persons were arrested under charges of sabotage and two were executed by a firing squad.Siddiqi, Asif A.; \\"Rockets Red Glare: Technology, Conflict, and Terror in the Soviet Union; Technology & Culture, vol. 44, 2003, p. 470 Slutskin and his LEMO staff, however, remained safe and turned to converting the Zenit to a new, improved system. Germany started the invasion of the USSR in June 1941, and Kharkov was a primary target. In a short while, all of the critical operations in Kharkov were ordered to evacuate into the Far East. For this, the UPTI was split, most going to Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan, and the LEMO to Bukhar in Uzbekistan, separated by 1,500 km; thus the war accomplished what the scientists had earlier failed to do. The evacuation started in October 1941, but it was well into 1942 before facilities in Bukhara were in operation. With Slutskin remaining the director, the new radio-location project was placed under Truten. Code-named Rubin, this system used an improved transmitter and receiver from Zenit, but had a single antenna, made possible by a device (a duplexer) personally developed by Truten. The times for determining coordinates were greatly reduced by displaying measurements on a cathode-ray tube. By August 1943, a prototype Rubin system was completed and transported to Moscow, where it was demonstrated in an anti-aircraft battery. While the Rubin was being developed, however, the USSR received a GL Mk II radar from the British. This was a well-tested, gun-laying system and was immediately reverse-engineered and placed into production, thus eliminating the need for the Rubin.Kostenko, A. A., A. I. Nosich., and I. A. Tishchenko; \\"Radar Prehistory, Soviet Side\\", Proceedings of IEEE APS International Symposium 2001, vol. 4, 2002, p. 44 As the war closed in the summer of 1945, both the UPTI and the LEMO returned to Kharkov (changed in spelling to Kharkiv), but remained fully separate organizations. Slutskin, then in his mid-60s, continued to head the LEMO as well as serving as a professor at Kharkiv State University. Earlier, in 1939, Slutskin had been elected as a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and in 1948, his status was upgraded to Academician. Before he died in 1950, Slutskin gradually turned the LEMO leadership over to Truten and Usikov. In 1955, the LEMO became the Institute of Radio-Physics and Electronics (IRE), initially headed by Usikov.  Reference notes  According to standard practice, Abram Slutskin cannot be named \\"Russian scientist\\" because he lived and worked all his life in Ukraine. For instance, his most famous former student Semion Braude is correctly mentioned in Wikipedia as \\"Ukrainian scientist.\\" He can be called, however, a Soviet scientist although he started his research career well before the communist revolution [1a,2a]. He was an ethnic Ukrainian Jew (similarly to S. Braude) by his origin. Through his career, Slutskin had much stronger ties with the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine than with any organization or agency in Russia. Until his death he remained strongly negative to the involvement of UPTI under the umbrella of the Moscow-based 1-st Chief Directorate (nicknamed \\"Nuclear Politburo\\") and kept his LEMO out of this structure [1a]. The magnetrons developed by Slutskin between 1925 and 1941 were not the \\"cavity magnetrons\\" that became famous during the World War II, they were the \\"split-anode magnetrons\\" [2a]. This device had no internal high-quality cavities that stabilized the frequency of the generated electromagnetic oscillations. As a result, the split-anode magnetrons were extremely unstable sources and their use in the design of pulsed radar was not successful. The true cavity magnetron was invented by Randall and Boot in 1939-1940; it had 6 and later 8 side cavities at 10-cm wavelength and 10 kW output power. A similar device of Alekseev and Malyarov dated 1936 (their Soviet paper published in 1940 was translated in the US in 1944 where Malyarov was erroneously typed as \\"Malairov\\"); however it had only 4 side cavities and therefore the output power was only 300 W at 9 cm [3a]. This was in fact the design of M. Bonch-Bruyevich who was under investigation for (false) sabotage at that moment and whose name was apparently not allowed for mentioning. UPTI and LEMO did not come back to Kharkiv in 1945 as separate entities; instead, LEMO had remained a department (later, a sector) inside UPTI till the final separation in 1955 [1a]. A. Slutskin had been remaining a staunch opponent of the separation of LEMO (that was pushed by K. Sinelnikov, the post-war director of UPTI with support of the 1-st Chief Directorate) until his death. He died unexpectedly in 1950 of the heart attack when waiting for a flight back from Moscow. He was very strong character and it is a mistake to believe that he was thinking about delegating his leadership in LEMO to Truten or Usikov. His most talented and high-positioned student at that moment (and later on) was S. Braude - the only one who had a higher doctorate (D.Sc., since 1943). In his last interview around 2000, Braude recalled how, in the late 1940s, Slutskin charged him with doing research into the microwave propagation but removed him from the magnetron research telling that magnetrons were to be pursued by Slutskin himself.

Generally, micro-schools do not meet all 5 days of the school week, and their schedules look different than a traditional public or private school. Classes can be taught using a flipped classroom approach, a form of blended learning, though not all micro- schools focus on technology in the same ways. Classes tend to be more impactful due to meeting fewer times in the week. Classes may use instructional methods, ranging from traditional lecture-based approaches to hands-on and activity-based approaches. Micro-schooling is viewed as a replacement for various school paradigms that are standard worldwide. Micro- schooling is seen as being in between homeschooling and private schooling and is designed to offer a full-year of education at around $10,000 or often less. Its growing popularity stems from a general dissatisfaction of how schools (public and private) often structure their content. Homeschool families are drawn to the idea because of how micro-schooling establishes a core set of learning experiences similar to what might be found in normal schools that parents can then expand on and individualize for their children. Private and public school parents see micro-schooling as an affordable option that provides their children with a more worldly education that some might consider as Constructivism (learning theory) in approach.  History  Micro-schooling began in the UK as small independent schools, privately funded by groups of like minded parents, with no dedicated premises (home rotation) led by a full- time paid tutors (as opposed to homeschooling where a parent tutors their own child (or children)). Cushla Barry first coined the term micro-schooling in February 2010. It has also been explored by education writers like Anya Kementz, who spoke about the return of the one-room school house  United Kingdom  It is set to be a rising trend in the UK, where getting your child into a good local school is becoming increasingly difficult due to underfunding and overcrowding. The UK Conservative party alluded to the concept of Micro-Schooling in 2007 with their concept of Pioneer schools.  New York City In the early 2000s, as the cost of private school became increasingly exorbitant and availability of spaces declined, a movement of preschool co-ops and homeschool co-ops started by teachers and parents started emerging to directly meet the needs of children in the community. CottageClass is one company which supports the creation of microschools, with fifteen schools operating in Brooklyn alone.  San Francisco Bay Area  Since 2010, micro-schooling has evolved in scope from the simple idea of privately funded groups of learners to a full concept of a specialized learning environment dedicated to ensuring individual understanding of the subjects being taught. Students attend a school for up to 2 days a week and cover a more diverse set of topics and subjects than would otherwise be accessible in small, private groups.  Pedagogy  In order to provide the same amount of learning in fewer days, micro-schooling has of late become associated with a movement in education to provide students with hands-on and activity-based learning that often pairs experts with the students in the classroom. The overall approach might be considered Constructivism (learning theory) in approach. Lecture, worksheets, and book work are often eschewed in favor of carefully constructed activities that are designed to help the learner to develop their own personal understanding. In this model, teachers will typically avoid making definitive statements of understanding to the students and will instead help the students work towards their own understanding. It is uncommon to see letter grading in micro-schools. Micro-schools will often pair suggested extracurricular activities, field trips, programs, books, and other multimedia with their classes so that students will have a broader exposure to content than what is just offered in the classroom.  Learning Outcomes  Despite the relatively short time frame that micro-schools have existed, there has been evidence that shows students are often learning more concepts in the classroom in a shorter time frame. It is unclear whether or not those students are retaining those concepts over longer periods of time due to the short time frame that micro-schooling has existed.  National Standards  As a potential point of controversy, micro-schooling often does not consider national standards as relevant to the educational needs of students and instead seeks to develop content and curriculum that helps create a passion for learning in the students that focuses on real-world knowledge and skills. Educators involved with micro-schooling often feel that standards hamper their flexibility to develop engaging and enriching curriculum. Micro-schools will often choose their own set of standards and it can readily be shown that many of those standards, but not all, map to the Common Core. In many cases the content covered by micro-schools can exceed the standards provided by the state, particularly in regard to the four key content areas of mathematics, language arts, history, and especially science.

Seen primarily in the United States and other Americanized countries, the sign originated among deaf schoolchildren using American Sign Language to create a sign from a combination of the signs for the letters I, L, and Y (I Love You). The sign is an informal expression of any of several positive feelings, ranging from general esteem to love, for the recipient of the sign. A similar-looking but unrelated variation (thumb toward the palm rather than thumb extended) appears in heavy metal music culture as a \\"horns\\" hand-sign and in college football as a sign of support for various teams including the University of Texas. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette‚Äôs Ragin‚Äô Cajuns Athletics uses the ILY sign to symbolize the initials of the university (UL). History Deaf Heritage dates the origin of the ILY to 1905. The sign received significant media exposure with Richard Dawson's use of the ILY in his sign off from each episode of the Family Feud, which he hosted from 1976 to 1985. Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter reportedly picked it up from a group of deaf supporters in the Midwest and, in 1977, during his Inauguration Day parade, flashed the ILY to a group of deaf people on the sidewalk. Popular 80s professional wrestler Jimmy Snuka would frequently flash the ILY sign with both hands during his matches and interviews, including while standing on the top rope before delivering his finishing move \\"Superfly Splash\\". In popular culture Gene Simmons showing the ILY sign at a fashion show, 2012 The ILY sign is used by Doctor Strange as a means to cast his mystical spells. An upside-down version of the ILY sign is used by Spider-Man as a means to activate his webbing, by holding the sign palm up, with his wrists bent back so his index and pinky fingers are pointing towards the ground. Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss has used the symbol in photoshoots, concerts and public appearances since 1974. He has stated in a television interviews that he was a Marvel comics fan, and was inspired by the Doctor Strange use of the symbol to use it himself in photoshoots. He later (by 1976 or earlier) had black gloves made that lacked index and pinky fingers so that even his raised open hand would emulate the ILY sign. The ending pose of the popular K-pop song Boy With Luv by BTS also incorporates this sign with all the members turning around and their right hands in this sign. All throughout the K-pop song Fancy by Twice, the members of the group do this gesture when dancing.

Properties Uranium hydride is a highly toxic, brownish grey to brownish black pyrophoric powder or brittle solid. Its density at 20 ¬∞C is 10.95 g cm‚àí3, much lower than that of uranium (19.1 g cm‚àí3). It has a metallic conductivity, is slightly soluble in hydrochloric acid and decomposes in nitric acid. Two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist, both cubic: an Œ± form that is obtained at low temperatures and a Œ≤ form that is grown when the formation temperature is above 250 ¬∞C. After growth, both forms are metastable at room temperature and below, but the Œ± form slowly converts to the Œ≤ form upon heating to 100 ¬∞C. Both Œ±- and Œ≤-UH3 are ferromagnetic at temperatures below ~180 K. Above 180 K, they are paramagnetic. Formation in uranium metal Hydrogen gas reaction Exposure of uranium metal to hydrogen leads to hydrogen embrittlement. Hydrogen diffuses through metal and forms a network of brittle hydride over the grain boundaries. Hydrogen can be removed and ductility renewed by annealing in vacuum. Uranium metal heated to 250 to 300 ¬∞C (482 to 572 ¬∞F) reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride. Further heating to about 500 ¬∞C will reversibly remove the hydrogen. This property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide, nitride, and halide compounds. The reversible reaction proceeds as follows: :2 U + 3 H2 2 UH3 Uranium hydride is not an interstitial compound, causing the metal to expand upon hydride formation. In its lattice, each uranium atom is surrounded by 6 other uranium atoms and 12 atoms of hydrogen; each hydrogen atom occupies a large tetrahedral hole in the lattice. The density of hydrogen in uranium hydride is approximately the same as in liquid water or in liquid hydrogen. The U-H-U linkage through a hydrogen atom is present in the structure. Water reaction Uranium hydride forms when uranium metal (e.g. in Magnox fuel with corroded cladding) becomes exposed to water; the reaction proceeds as follows: :7 U + 6 H2O ‚Üí 3 UO2 \\\\+ 4 UH3 The resulting uranium hydride is pyrophoric; if the metal (e.g. a damaged fuel rod) is exposed to air afterwards, excessive heat may be generated and the bulk uranium metal itself can ignite. Hydride-contaminated uranium can be passivated by exposition to a gaseous mixture of 98% helium with 2% oxygen. Condensed moisture on uranium metal promotes formation of hydrogen and uranium hydride; a pyrophoric surface may be formed in absence of oxygen. This poses a problem with underwater storage of spent nuclear fuel in spent fuel ponds. Depending on the size and distribution on the hydride particles, self-ignition can occur after an indeterminate length of exposure to air. Such exposure poses risk of self-ignition of fuel debris in radioactive waste storage vaults. Uranium metal exposed to steam produces a mixture of uranium hydride and uranium dioxide. Uranium hydride exposed to water evolves hydrogen. In contact with strong oxidizers this may cause fire and explosions. Contact with halocarbons may cause a violent reaction. Other chemical reactions Polystyrene-impregnated uranium hydride powder is non-pyrophoric and can be pressed, however its hydrogen-carbon ratio is unfavorable. Hydrogenated polystyrene was introduced in 1944 instead. Uranium deuteride is said to be usable for design of some types of neutron initiators. Uranium hydride enriched to about 5% uranium-235 is proposed as a combined nuclear fuel/neutron moderator for the Hydrogen Moderated Self-regulating Nuclear Power Module. According to the aforementioned patent application, the reactor design in question begins producing power when hydrogen gas at a sufficient temperature and pressure is admitted to the core (made up of granulated uranium metal) and reacts with the uranium metal to form uranium hydride. Uranium hydride is both a nuclear fuel and a neutron moderator; apparently it, like other neutron moderators, will slow neutrons sufficiently to allow for fission reactions to take place; the uranium-235 atoms within the hydride also serve as the nuclear fuel. Once the nuclear reaction has started, it will continue until it reaches a certain temperature, approximately , where, due to the chemical properties of uranium hydride, it chemically decomposes and turns into hydrogen gas and uranium metal. The loss of neutron moderation due to the chemical decomposition of the uranium hydride will consequently slow ‚Äî and eventually halt ‚Äî the reaction. When temperature returns to an acceptable level, the hydrogen will again combine with the uranium metal, forming uranium hydride, restoring moderation and the nuclear reaction will start again. Uranium zirconium hydride (UZrH), a combination of uranium hydride and zirconium(II) hydride, is used as a fuel/moderator in the TRIGA-class reactors. On heating with diborane, uranium hydride produces uranium boride. With bromine at 300 ¬∞C, uranium(IV) bromide is produced. With chlorine at 250 ¬∞C, uranium(IV) chloride is produced. Hydrogen fluoride at 20 ¬∞C produces uranium(IV) fluoride. Hydrogen chloride at 300 ¬∞C produces uranium(III) chloride. Hydrogen bromide at 300 ¬∞C produces uranium(III) bromide. Hydrogen iodide at 300 ¬∞C produces uranium(III) iodide. Ammonia at 250 ¬∞C produces uranium(III) nitride. Hydrogen sulfide at 400 ¬∞C produces uranium(IV) sulfide. Oxygen at 20 ¬∞C produces triuranium octoxide. Water at 350 ¬∞C produces uranium dioxide. Uranium hydride ion may interfere with some mass spectrometry measurements, appearing as a peak at mass 239, creating false increase of signal for plutonium-239. History Uranium hydride slugs were used in the \\"tickling the dragon's tail\\" series of experiments to determine the critical mass of uranium. Uranium hydride and uranium deuteride were suggested as a fissile material for a uranium hydride bomb. The tests with uranium hydride and uranium deuteride during Operation Upshot‚ÄìKnothole were disappointing, however. During the early phases of the Manhattan Project, in 1943, uranium hydride was investigated as a promising bomb material; it was abandoned by early 1944 as it turned out that such a design would be inefficient. Applications Hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium can be purified by reacting with uranium, then thermally decomposing the resulting hydride/deuteride/tritide. Extremely pure hydrogen has been prepared from beds of uranium hydride for decades. Heating uranium hydride is a convenient way to introduce hydrogen into a vacuum system. The swelling and pulverization at uranium hydride synthesis can be used for preparation of very fine uranium metal, if the powdered hydride is thermally decomposed. Uranium hydride can be used for isotope separation of hydrogen, preparing uranium metal powder, and as a reducing agent.

Its affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor was reported to be 4.8 nM (Ki) (or 8.33 (pKi)), and its intrinsic activity approximately equal to that of serotonin (i.e., 100%). Eptapirone and related high-efficacy 5-HT1A full and super agonists such as befiradol and F-15,599 were developed under the hypothesis that the maximum exploitable therapeutic benefits of 5-HT1A receptor agonists might not be able to be seen without the drugs employed possessing sufficiently high intrinsic activity at the receptor. As 5-HT1A receptor agonism, based on animal and other research, looked extremely promising for the treatment of depression from a theoretical perspective, this idea was developed as a potential explanation for the relatively modest clinical effectiveness seen with already available 5-HT1A receptor agonists like buspirone and tandospirone, which act merely as weak- to-moderate partial agonists of the receptor. Animal studies In the Porsolt forced swimming test, eptapirone was found to suppress immobility more robustly than buspirone, ipsapirone, flesinoxan, paroxetine, and imipramine, which was suggestive of strong antidepressant-like effects. In this assay, unlike the other drugs screened, buspirone actually increased the immobility time with a single administration, while repeated administration decreased it, an effect that may have been related to buspirone's relatively weak intrinsic activity (~30%) at the 5-HT1A receptor and/or its preferential activation of 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors over postsynaptic receptors. After repeated administration, high dose paroxetine was able to rival the reduction in immobility seen with eptapirone. However, efficacy was seen on the first treatment with eptapirone, which suggested that eptapirone may have the potential for a more rapid onset of antidepressant effectiveness in comparison. Imipramine was unable to match the efficacy of eptapirone or high dose paroxetine, which was probably the result of the fact that higher doses were fatal. In the conflict procedure, eptapirone produced substantial increases in punished responding without affecting unpunished responding, which was suggestive of marked anxiolytic-like effects. In addition, the efficacy of eptapirone in this assay was more evident than that of buspirone, ipsapirone, and flesinoxan. Human studies Eptapirone has been assayed in humans in preclinical trials at an oral dose of 1.5 mg. In these studies, eptapirone reduced body temperature, prolonged REM sleep, increased cortisol and growth hormone levels, and produced side effects such as dizziness and drowsiness while being overall well tolerated. It peaked rapidly within 30‚Äì60 minutes and had an estimated half-life of two hours, with a total duration of approximately three hours.

Parts of the neighboring city of Albany around Watervliet Avenue Extension and Industrial Park Road are also considered part of West Albany and includes the majority of the West Albany Rail Yard. The hamlet lies along Albany's northern border and was once home to many industries including one of the largest cattle stockyards in the United States, a large railroad switching yard, and a Tobin First Prize packing plant. Those industries are gone now and the community is mostly a residential suburb of Albany in the shadow of abandoned industrial complexes. West Albany has historically been ethnically diverse with Polish, Italian, Irish, German, and English immigrants drawn by the 5,000+ jobs at the West Albany Rail Yard. Though the neighborhood is predominately Italian-American, it remains diverse with the Polish American Citizens Club, the West Albany Italian Benevolent Society, the Bet Shraga Hebrew Academy, and a Korean worship center in the former St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church. History Andrew R. Hunter purchased in the 1850s extensive holdings in what would become West Albany, improving and surveying lots that he would then subsequently sell to homesteaders. He is credited with making West Albany. Though Hunter is credited with settling West Albany it is to industry that credit must be given for making West Albany a name in the world. The cattle stockyards were moved here from Albany in 1860 and quickly rose to national importance, ranking just behind Chicago and Buffalo at the end of the 1880s, and occasionally even surpassing them in business transacted. Growth in the hamlet accelerated due to the presence of the railroads, stockyards, meat packing and related industries. A post office was established in 1862 and in 1865 the horse railway (an early form of mass transit) was extended up Central Ave from downtown Albany to West Albany. Engine 999 as it leads the Empire State Express through Palatine, New York in 1905. The location of the cattle yards and the subsequent development of West Albany would not have been possible without the railroads. In 1844 the railroad between Albany and Schenectady east of Fuller Road was moved north from the central part of the city to the Tivoli Hollow Line which ran across the northern border of the city along Patroon Creek and through West Albany. The Albany & Schenectady Railroad which owned this line was merged with nine other railroads as the New York Central Railroad (NYC) in 1853; and work soon began on the establishment of a large rail yard, on purchased in 1854 in West Albany. It would later be expanded to include another . The NYCRR shops at the West Albany Yard employed over 6,000 people at its height at the turn of the 20th century. In 1893 those shops built Engine 999 as a special publicity project in order to win an international competition to build the world's fastest steam locomotive. Engine #999 won at 102.8 miles per hour, the first time the 100 mile/hour mark was reached by a locomotive. Today the engine is on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. About the same time as Engine 999 was being built locomotive construction was starting to be outsourced to the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in nearby Schenectady, and the last steam engine to be repaired at the West Albany Shops would be in 1952, with the train car repair shops closing in 1954. The site was sold in 1955, equipment auctioned in 1956, and the majority of the buildings were demolished in 1964. The West Albany Industrial Park in the city of Albany occupies most of the site today and there remains a small freight car operation. The main track continues to be used by freight and Amtrak passenger trains. West Albany sat at the center of a railroad crossroads where the road west from New England met the road coming north from New York City for traffic to travel west. This became a sore bottleneck for the NYC due to the West Albany Hill being the steepest grade between the East Coast and Chicago. By 1922 the large grade and other inadequacies of the West Albany Yard, along with issues concerning the low drawbridges across the Hudson River leading to it, led to the building of the Castleton Cutoff, including the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge and the Selkirk Yard. Trains could now bypass the entire city of Albany. The slaughterhouse roots of West Albany continued into the later half of the 20th century, decades after the railroad abandoned hamlet, thanks to the Tobin Packing Company. In 1924 the Albany Packing Company was incorporated, and it would later merge with the Rochester Packing Company to form the Tobin Packing Company. Tobin's First Prize continues to be one of the most top-selling brands in the Northeastern U.S., and especially Albany, according to the current owner of the brand, John Morrell and Company. The plant, also referred to as Tobin's First Prize Center, was according to former employees so busy it pumped out 50,000 hot dogs, 700 hams, and 20,000 pounds of kielbasa a day; and every hour roughly 360 hogs were slaughtered to keep up with this production. When the Tobin meat-packing plant closed in 1981 it employed 600 people. The First Prize Center has seen interest from several different retail development plans, including at one point or another either a Walmart, Kmart (which backed away when it filed for bankruptcy), Home Depot (which decided to build on the other side of Interstate 90 on Central Ave in Albany), or Lowe's. The site was even considered for a new county nursing home. The Albany County Industrial Development Agency (IDA) has owned the property since the late 1980s after purchasing it from the US Federal Government foreclosure sale. With the loss of the rail yard and Tobin's the community began somewhat of a decline, at least as measured by enrollment in the West Albany Elementary School. In 1984 the school was closed after years of declining enrollment. This school has its origins as the West Albany Union Free School 19 which was established in 1857, and in 1947 the district was consolidated with others in the town of Colonie to form the South Colonie Central School District. The building continues to be used for educational purposes as the home of a Hebrew Academy. Geography West Albany is in the southern part of the town of Colonie, along the border with Albany. Like all hamlets in New York, West Albany is very loosely defined geographically. Portions of the hamlet have been annexed to the neighboring city of Albany, but still identify as West Albany. Exchange Street is considered to be main street, though Everett Road (Albany County Route 155) and Sand Creek Road are more important thoroughfares. Recent suburbanization of the former farms and woodlands surrounding West Albany has further blurred the identity of West Albany and eliminated any buffer from neighboring hamlets such as Loudonville and Roessleville.

The party was founded on March 12, 1922, in Krakow. Initially the party bore the name Party of Independent Socialists (Partia Niezale≈ºnych Socjalist√≥w). Boles≈Çaw Drobner was the chairman of the party. The party became affiliated with the Vienna International.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. pp. 317-318 The party demanded nationalizations of key industries, equality for national minorities and development of bilateral links with the Soviet Union. In the summer of 1922, the Fareynikte merged into party. At the time of the merger, the Fareynikte had conditioned their entry into the party demanding that separate national minority sections (for Jews, Germans, Ukrainians, etc..) to be formed within the party. That re-organization never materialized, though. From 1923 onwards, the party was affiliated with the Labour and Socialist International (into which the Vienna International had merged). On September 21, 1924, a Polish Socialist Party-splinter group, the Socialist League \\"Praca\\", merged into the party. As of 1925 the party had around 2,500 members. G≈Ços Niezale≈ºnych Socjalist√≥w was the central organ of the party. During the period 1924-1926 the party was involved in confrontations with the Polish Socialist Party over influence inside the trade union movement. In mid-1925 the party founded the Association of Free Trade Unions of Poland (ZWZZP). ZWZZP was soon taken over by communists.Campbell, Joan. European Labor Unions. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1992. p. 352 By 1927 the party was in crisis. The question on cooperation with the communists divided the party. The party was split in two, one group led by Drobner and another led by Joseph Kruk. Drobner's group merged into the Polish Socialist Party in 1928, whilst Kruk's group continued to function as a party of its own.

It is among the first mainstream movies to show a same-sex couple raising two teenagers. A hit at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, it opened in limited release on July 9, 2010, expanding to more theaters on July 30, 2010. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 16, 2010. The film was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and Annette Bening was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film also received four Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, at the 83rd Academy Awards. Plot Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married same-sex couple living in the Los Angeles area. Nic is an obstetrician and Jules is a housewife who is starting a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor. The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his biological father, but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank, which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo), a restaurant owner, as the donor. When the three meet, Joni is impressed by Paul's bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. Paul is appreciative of Jules' talent, something that Jules has felt lacking from Nic. After Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, they end up in bed together and start an affair. Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycle‚Äîwhich Nic has forbidden‚Äîand by suggesting she give Joni more freedom. After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension. Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul. However, Nic discovers some of Jules's red hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom. When they return home, Nic confronts Jules. At first, Jules denies it but then admits to the affair. Nic is devastated, but Jules assures her she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated. Joni and Laser overhear the argument and are upset at Jules. The household becomes tense and Jules is forced to sleep on the couch. Paul thinks he has fallen in love with Jules and suggests she leave Nic, bring the kids, and come live with him. Jules declines, disgusted with Paul's lack of understanding about her sexuality. The night before Joni leaves home to attend college, Paul turns up at the house. Nic angrily confronts him and tells him if he wants a family so much, he should make one of his own. Rejected, Paul watches Laser from outside the window, trying to get his attention, but Laser ignores him. Later that night, Jules tearfully tells the kids, \\"Your mom and I are in hell right now,\\" and begs her family's forgiveness. The next morning, the family drives Joni to college. While Nic and Jules hug Joni goodbye, they also affectionately touch each other. During the ride home, Laser tells his mothers that they should not break up because they are too old. Jules and Nic giggle, and the film ends with them smiling at each other and holding hands.

The project was helped to get off the ground by the caliber of actors who agreed to join, first Julianne Moore, followed by Mark Ruffalo and Annette Bening. Cholodenko stated \\"People really admired what Stuart [Blumberg] and I got on the page but there was a fear factor regarding how the film was going to make money, as the subject matter is tricky.\\" The film nearly got the green-light in 2006, but Cholodenko postponed the project after she became pregnant by way of an anonymous sperm donor. After giving birth, she resumed work on the film and won financing from three major investors, including the French distributor UGC. Principal photography was completed in 23 days in Los Angeles in July 2009. The film was made for approximately $4 million. The filmmakers rushed to finish the post-production in time for the Sundance Film Festival, where it was admitted after the deadline for competitive entries. On January 25, 2010 the film had its premiere, becoming one of the festival's breakout hits. A few days later, Focus Features acquired the distribution rights for $4.8 million.

The castle is now a museum, and it is still inhabited by Wittekind, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont and his family. As a result, it continues to serve as a residence of the former ruling family of the Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont. It was the birthplace of Princess Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, who became the Queen consort of the Netherlands during the late 19th century. History Built during the early 18th century, the castle's main building was completed in 1728. The furnishings, equipment, furniture, remained for several decades until the castle was finally handed over to its use. Built in 1840, the F√ºrstlich Waldecksche Hofbibliothek (Princely Waldeck Court Library) today contains virtually all literature of the 18th century in relevant fields of knowledge. The collection focuses on the Universal geography, history, literature, and militaria. In 1992, Jeff Koons created a 13-metre tall topiary sculpture called the Puppy to be displayed at the castle's park. Arolsen Klebeband The library is known for its \\"tape\\" books or \\"klebeband\\" books. These are blank books that could be filled with engravings that were popular among nobility. The Arolsen books are still intact, while many others have been disassembled in the past. These have been digitised by a society created specifically for this purpose.Die Klebeb√§nde der F√ºrstlich Waldeckschen Hofbibliothek Arolsen : Wissenstransfer und -transformation in der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit, by Marie Isabelle Vogel, Peter Lang Edition, Frankfurt am Main, 2015, References *Residenzschloss Arolsen (German) *Eduard Brauns: Wanderungen durch Nordhessen und Waldeck.

Men's and women's outdoor track were added in Spring 2013. Men's and women's golf started in the fall of 2013. Both the male and female athletic teams are called the West Alabama Tigers. 16 teams participate in the NCAA's Division II as a member of the Gulf South Conference. Men's and women's rodeo compete in the Ozark Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. Athletics facilities on the campus include 7,000-seat Tiger Stadium, James P. Homer ye s, Pruitt Hall, Tartt Field, UWA Softball Complex, Dora Dahlberg Beard Indoor Practice Facility, Howard R. Vaughan Tennis Complex, Don C. Hines Rodeo Complex, and UWA Cross Country Facility. Main rivalries for the program include those with the North Alabama Lions and Delta State Statesmen. The rivalry with North Alabama is especially heated as the two compete annually in nearly all sports. Other rivalries include those against the Alabama- Huntsville Chargers, Valdosta State Blazers, West Florida Argonauts, and West Georgia Wolves. The Tigers had a rivalry against the Montevallo Falcons before they left the GSC to join the Peach Belt Conference. West Alabama's athletic director is Bobby Wallace. The school's official mascot is Luie the Tiger.  Fall sports   Football  West Alabama's football team was first fielded in 1931 when the school was known as Livingston State Teachers College. However, intercollegiate competition for all the university‚Äôs athletics was not scheduled until seven years later. In 1938, they competed in four games against Marion Institute, Jacksonville State, Demopolis A.S, and Troy State, all of whom were local teams. LSTC finished the season 2-2. That year also marked the start of World War II which led to a decline in college enrollment across the United States. Therefore, LSTC fielded no athletic teams from 1942-1945. In 1944, Dr. William Wilson Hill became president of the university and instantly started recruiting students to enroll. The return of males to campus reestablished an interest in sports. After a three-year hiatus, the football team returned to action under the guidance of new head coach E.G McCollum. They opened their season with the first of many future match-ups against Mississippi College, which resulted in a 24-14 loss. Also, that season, LSTC renewed its rivalry with, eventual Gulf South Conference foes, Troy State and Delta State. The team concluded the season with a 6-3 record. Due to success of the season, McCollum resigned to pursue a bigger opportunity elsewhere. Following two dismal seasons from 1947 and 1948, LSTC made a bold move and hired former University of Alabama star Vaughn Mancha as the fourth head coach in team history. Mancha at the time was only 28 years old with no prior coaching experience. The former two-time All-American had also recently completed his first and only season in the NFL as a member of the Boston Yanks. Under Mancha, the team experienced immediate success. In his first season, he led LSTC to one of the biggest accomplishments in school history, a 13-6 win over Florida State. The team also concluded the regular season 7-1-1, which at the time marked the best record in school history. The historical season earned LSTC right to play in the Paper Bowl against Jacksonville State. JSU won the hard-fought defensive affair, 12-7. Until 1952, the Tigers played home games at Livingston High School. From then on, all their home games were played at Tiger Stadium, a 7,000-capacity stadium located on filled in land that was previously known as \\"Crawdad Creek.\\" The stadium was built to fill the need for an on-campus stadium. Next season was once again successful as the team finished 6-3-1. However, they could not duplicate the accomplishments of the previous season. During Mancha‚Äôs third season, the team started off 2-4 and showed heavy signs of decline until putting on a strong finish to end the season 5-5. This season would mark the last in Mancha‚Äôs tenure at LSTC as he decided to take over as defensive coordinator at Florida State. Mancha departed with an 18-10-2 overall record. The Tigers underwent a 15-year-long drought without a winning season after the departure of Mancha. The team‚Äôs most success came in 1965 when they finished 5-4. Their luck finally started to change after hiring Morris Higginbotham in 1967. Before coming to Livingston, he was one of the most successful high school coaches in Alabama, compiling a 111-27-8 record. The native of Birmingham, earned Alabama Collegiate Conference Coach of the Year honors for the efforts of his 1968 team that featured a 9-2 mark and an appearance in the Peanut Bowl in Dothan, Alabama. Higginbotham only remained at the school for three seasons leading the Tigers to a 19-9-2 record. Higginbotham was succeeded by assistant head coach Mickey Andrews. Similar to the path of former LU head coach, Vaughn Mancha, Andrews starred in football and baseball at the University of Alabama from 1961-1964 before being hired at the university in 1967. Andrews spent three seasons guiding the UWA football team, leading the Tigers to a 24-7-2 record during his tenure. The team also won their first and only championship in school history during the 1971 season defeating Arkansas Tech. LU's bid for a second consecutive NAIA National Championship came up short to Carson-Newman in the 1972 NAIA semi-final. Both teams battled to a 7-7 tie. However, a controversial tiebreaker ruling went in favor of Carson-Newman. In 1973, Andrews became the second LU head coach to resign and accept the defensive coordinator position at Florida State. With the next coach, once again, LU made a decision to hire a coach from within the program as they selected Andrews‚Äô top assistant, Jim King. King, a native of Adamsville, Alabama, came to LU in 1970. In 1975, he led the Tigers to the NCAA playoffs with a 10-3 record. In the NCAA Quarter Finals, the team faced a tough task of taking on #1 ranked North Dakota. The game was nearly cancelled due to heavy snow. Nevertheless, LU prevailed in a huge upset to move on. During the Semi-Finals, they faced a tough Northern Michigan team on national television. Although LU jumped out to a 10-0 lead, they eventually fell short 28-26. King, like several successful LU coaches before him, moved on to a new opportunity elsewhere. In only three seasons, he compiled a 29-14-1 record. Since that time, the Tigers have faced their share of good but mostly bad seasons. The hiring of Bobby Wallace in 2006 marked a new era within the football program. Wallace‚Äôs first head coaching stint came in the GSC when he was the head coach at the University of North Alabama from 1988-1997. During his time at UNA, he led the Lions to three consecutive national championships from 1993-1995 as his squads finished with an overall record of 41-1 during the course of those three seasons. The 1995 team was selected as the \\"Best Team of the Quarter Century\\" in Division II. Wallace also led UNA to Gulf South Conference Championships during the 1993‚Äì95 seasons, while his Lions also qualified for the NCAA Division II Playoffs six times during his tenure. Over his 10 seasons at the helm, he compiled an overall mark of 82-36-1, and he also produced a total of 12 NFL players. Prior to arriving in Livingston, he had served as the head coach at Temple University since 1997. Upon hiring Wallace, many around UWA hoped he could lead the football team back to its glory days. The Wallace Era began with a great glimmer of hope as UWA recorded its first winning season in 14 years. The Tigers finished 6-5 on the season. UWA also ended several streaks picking up wins at Lambuth, against Southern Arkansas, and at Arkansas-Monticello. The excitement was put on hold, however, as the team finished the 2007 season with a 1-9 record and posted a 4-7 record in 2008. allace and his team put together a memorable season in 2009. The season began with three consecutive victories including a televised home win over Arkansas Tech. Unfortunately, three consecutive losses followed. A couple of wins over #22 Delta State and Arkansas-Monticello put UWA right back in the thick of the playoff race, but a loss to West Georgia the following week nearly derailed their hopes. During the season finale, UWA was locked in a battle for their playoff lives against longtime rival and Wallace‚Äôs former team, North Alabama. At the time, UNA was ranked #1 in all the Division II polls. Through a fearless and courageous effort, UWA sent the game to overtime after losing the lead they held throughout the game. After four overtimes, it appeared UNA was set to claim the victory until a forced fumble gave UWA the ball. From that, they took advantage and kicked the game-winning field goal. It was the first win for the Tigers at Braly Municipal Stadium in Florence since the 1987 season. The NCAA rewarded UWA's efforts with a berth in the NCAA Division II playoffs. In the first round, the Tigers upset #20 Albany State 24-22 on the road. After falling behind early against #10 Carson-Newman, the Tigers mounted a rally before falling short 59-41. The Tigers gathered an 8-5 record, the most wins since 1975, and had eight All-GSC honors. UWA posted a 5-1 record at Tiger Stadium, the best since 1985, and tallied the most wins over GSC opponents since 1981 with six. They received their first two rankings in school history at the end of the season. The AFCA placed them #21, while the D2Football.com poll placed them higher two spots at #19. UWA entered the 2010 season ranked 12th nationally by USA Today. The team was also ranked 23rd in the Lindy‚Äôs Preseason Top 25 poll and 24th in the Sporting News Preseason Top 25 poll. The UWA football team recorded its highest pre-season ranking since 1976 as the Tigers were selected second by the head coaches of the 2010 Gulf South Conference in the GSC Pre-Season Poll. The Red and White previously entered as the top ranked team in 1976 and 1972. West Alabama opened the season on August 28 against NAIA member Shorter in nearby Demopolis, Alabama. Tiger Stadium saw a major renovation as a synthetic surface was recently installed. The Tigers played their first contest on the new surface on September 18 against Lambuth but were narrowly defeated. UWA opened Gulf South Conference play with a home win over West Georgia but fell short to Delta State on the road. After a 3-2 start, the Tigers reeled off three consecutive wins including a last-second Homecoming triumph over Henderson State. It appeared the game had ended, but officials put a second back on the clock. Quarterback Deon Williams connected to wide receiver Gerald Worsham in the back of the endzone for the game-winner. The team dropped back-to-back heartbreakers the following two weeks before returning home to face Valdosta State in the season finale. The day before the contest, Bobby Wallace announced to his players that he would be stepping down as head coach upon the end of the season. After falling behind and trailing at the half, the Tigers upset the #7 ranked Blazers to give Wallace a victory in his final game. The team notched its second win ever against Valdosta State and picked up their first win in the series since 1985. UWA finished the season 7-4 to earn consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. Deon Williams was recognized as one of 24 candidates for the Harlon Hill Trophy, the Division II equivalent to Division I's Heisman Trophy. Offensive coordinator Will Hall was named Bobby Wallace's successor a week after the season concluded. Bobby Wallace was inducted into the Division II Hall of Fame in December to close out a storied career. The 2011 team went 8-4, beat DI foe Georgia State, and qualified for the NCAA DII tournament. The 2012 team went undefeated in Gulf South play (5-0) to claim the conference title. UWA defeated Miles College 41-7 in round one of the playoffs. The team lost at eventual national champion Valdosta State 49-21 in the second round. UWA finished 9-4.  Volleyball  The first known volleyball team for the University of West Alabama came in 1979. UWA struggled throughout the 1980s and early part of the 1990s. At this time, only season schedules beginning in 1994 are available. Under the direction of head coach Pam Gailbreath, the team won 9 games that year. The following year, UWA improved on its previous season finishing at 17-18. In 1996, the Tigers reached an all-time high going 32-14 to set a school record for wins. The next four seasons proved difficult for the Tigers as they could not get over the .500 point. Then, in 2001, UWA won 23 games to finish with a .575 winning percentage. They improved even more in 2002 when they went 25-13. After another cold spell through 2006, the 2007 season brought highlights setting the tone for years to come. UWA started the campaign 18-0 and was the only Division II undefeated team in America. For their efforts, the AVCA placed them #25, the first ranking in the program's history. A sweep over Albany State broke the school record for most consecutive wins. They went on to finish the season 27-6 in head coach Ron Arenz's final year. UWA recorded 8 conference wins, the most for the team since 2002. Although the season ended in the opening round of the GSC Tournament, the Tigers broke several school records throughout the season. In 2008, UWA continued their winning ways and achieved a 22-11 record. However, the Tigers learned they would be losing another head coach. Assistant coach Tabitha Turner was promoted to head coach for 2009. UWA was picked to finish third in the annual preseason poll. After starting the season slow through 14 games, the Tigers reeled off a 16-match winning streak pushing their record to 25-5 and 5-0 in the GSC. It was the third consecutive season in which UWA had won at least 20 matches. The team won the GSC East Division crown with a win at Valdosta State to close out regular season play. At the GSC Tournament, the Tigers fought back from a 2-1 deficit to top Arkansas Tech and advance to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, the team blanked Harding in a convincing sweep on their home court. A bid for the school's first GSC Championship ended in heartbreak to West Florida. UWA finished the season 30-8 and 8-2 in GSC play. After the season, Tabitha Turner was selected by the AVCA Thirty Under 30 list for 2010. Created in 2009, the award honors the top 30 at all volleyball levels. Instrumental in her first season at the helm and first as a head coach, Turner was also named Co-Coach of the Year in the East Division. The 2010 season was a rebuilding year for the Tigers as the squad finished with a 10-21 overall record. Jorday Lay was hired in February 2013 to replace interim head coach Mike Shearer. Lay came to UWA from Belhaven University, where he was named the 2012 Southern State Athletic Conference coach of the year after guiding the Blazers to a 27-9 regular season record, 9-5 in conference play. Combined with a pair of wins in the SSAC Tournament, Lay‚Äôs team set the Belhaven record for victories in a season with 29.  Men's soccer  The University of West Alabama started a men's soccer program in the fall of 2012. The first head coach was Matthew Thorne. UWA men's soccer won their first ever game against Oakwood 7-1 in Livingston on 8/31/12. The team picked up conference wins over Delta State, Christian Brothers, and Alabama-Huntsville, Shorter, and Union twice. They finished 12-6 with an 8-4 mark in the GSC.  Women's soccer  Effective September 2011, the University of West Alabama will introduce its first ever women's soccer program. Graeme Orr, a native of Eaglesham, Scotland has been announced as the school's first head coach. The first signing class was announced in March 2011 and features seven high school seniors and a pair of junior-college transfers. In the inaugural 2011 season, UWA finished 6-12 with a conference win over Delta State. 2012 saw the team show improvement going 7-8-3 with a 5-3-1 mark in the GSC with wins against Delta State, Christian Brothers, Shorter, Alabama-Huntsville, and West Georgia.  Winter sports   Men's basketball  The Tiger men‚Äôs basketball team was originally formed in 1939, but their first unofficial season took place after World War II in 1945. From 1945‚Äì1955, the team was led by future UWA Athletic Hall of Famers Pop Wagoner, Jack Jones, and Milton Johnson. The UWA record book, however, counts 1956‚Äì1957 as the official first men‚Äôs basketball season. Jones, who was a three-sport for UWA (then Livingston University) from 1947‚Äì1951, returned to the university to coach the basketball team in 1956. Although there were coaches before him, Jones is the first known head coach of Tiger men‚Äôs basketball. The team faced constant struggles under him. In his eight years at the helm, the 1956‚Äì57 season was the only one in which the team accomplished more than 10 wins. That season, they finished with an 11‚Äì10 record. At the conclusion of the 1962‚Äì63 season, Jones took a two-year hiatus away from coaching before returning for one last season in 1965. During that hiatus, Travis Clark tried his hand at turning the team around. With the help of a rising star in M.K Turk, Clark led the team to their second 11-win season in his first season. Turk led LU in scoring his junior and senior seasons. He was also named All-Conference twice. The 1964‚Äì65 season saw LU return to mediocrity as they finished 8‚Äì16. They recorded the same record during the following season, which was Jones‚Äô last at the helm. He finished his coaching career at LU with a 56‚Äì113 record. LU men‚Äôs basketball underwent a drastic change with the hiring of future UWA Athletics Hall of Famer, Jack Powell, in 1966. Under his tutelage, the team gradually formed in a contender. In Powell‚Äôs first two seasons as coach, the team made positive improvements but were still in need of a spark. That spark arrived when Bob Drake, Dave Harvey, Larry Cantrell and Butch Stafford made their way to the LU campus. Drake served two years as the Tiger team captain and was later an All-Alabama Collegiate Conference (ACC) selection. He made the All- ACC Tournament Team twice and was chosen for the All-Alabama Small College Team. During the 1969‚Äì70 season, LU recorded their first 16-win season. Later that season, they were crowned ACC tournament champions. With the addition of Elton Reece in 1970, the team built on the previous season‚Äôs success and finished with a school record 21 wins and four losses. The mark still stands as the most single-season wins in West Alabama history. It earned Powell Coach of the Year in the ACC and earned Coach of the Year honors from Alabama Small Colleges and Universities as well as NAIA District 27. Also that season, the Tigers won their second consecutive ACC crown. Stafford was named the ACC Tournament MVP. However, they were defeated in the NAIA District 27 finals. For the 1971‚Äì72 season, which turned out to be Powell‚Äôs last as head coach, LU finished 15-8 and won their third straight ACC championship. The team also returned to the NAIA District 27 finals where they once again suffered a defeat. Drake average 21.1 points per game in his senior campaign and made 166-of-205 free throws, which still stands as the second highest total for free throws made in a season at UWA. He also posted two 40-point games as a senior. Stafford was selected the first-ever GSC Player of the Year in basketball and garnered All-American honors. He finished his career with 1,143 points scored. Harvey is currently fifth all time in the UWA record books with 452 field goals made. Cantrell is the UWA all-time leader in rebound average with 16.35 and second all-time in rebounds with 785. Powell was selected as the first-ever Gulf South Conference Coach of the Year in basketball. After six seasons with LU, he retired from coaching with an 83-57 record. Powell‚Äôs 83 wins is currently ranked third all time in the UWA record books. He is also ranked fourth all time in GSC coaching wins. After Powell‚Äôs retirement, LU men‚Äôs basketball went through a heavy downslide. The team faced several coaching changes and dismal seasons. LU began to regain respectability during the magical and history making 1977‚Äì78 season. The season also marked a time of tragedy. On January 14, 1978, the team had just defeated Nicholls State in a conference match-up when they learned head coach Ken Brackett died after a long battle with cancer. A few weeks prior, Brackett was forced to take a medical leave as his condition began to weaken. Artie McIntosh, who had been serving as the interim head coach in Brackett‚Äôs absence, took over coaching duties for the remainder of that season. McIntosh, along with the trio of Rodney McKeever, Perry Smith and Cheyenne Jones, helped complete Brackett‚Äôs dramatic turnaround of the team finishing 18-8. Prior to his arrival in 1976, the team had only won 22 total games in three seasons. In Brackett‚Äôs first season, the Tigers finished 10-16 which was their best record since the 1973‚Äì74 season. McKeever garnered First Team All-Gulf South Conference honors while Jones earned second team honors. The team as a whole finished second in the GSC with an 11-4 conference record. LU also earned a trip to the NCAA Division II Men‚Äôs Basketball Tournament for the first in school history. The team opened tournament play in a South Regional match-up against Florida A&M; University. FAMU was heavily favored because of the game being played in Orlando, Florida. Despite that, LU gave the Rattlers all they could handle before coming up short in a 72-69 nail biter. With the loss, the Tigers played in a consolation game against Augusta College which also resulted in a classic finish. LU came away with a 91-90 victory. After the season, LU hired Wichita State assistant head coach, Ed Murphy, as the new head coach and athletic director. One of the top recruits Murphy brought in his first season was big man Tony Andre. With his signing, Perry Smith and Cheyenne Jones were able to once again form a big three and hoped to fill a void after McKeever‚Äôs graduation. In his first season, Murphy was able to keep up the previous season‚Äôs momentum as the team finished 15-11 and third in the GSC. However, they failed to earn their second straight trip the NCAA tournament. Jones was named the First Team All-Gulf Conference. Andre was named to the Second Team. The following season, Murphy picked up his second major freshman acquisition with the signing of Will Cotchery. Cotchery allowed LU to immediately fill the presence left by Cheyenne Jones. However, the 1979-1980 campaign was a forgetful one as the team took a step back. Cotchery and Andre did not perform up to expectations. Senior Perry Smith was the lone bright spot for the team. He later earned First Team All-GSC Conference honors for the first time in his career. LU as a team, meanwhile, finished fifth in the conference and 14-12 overall. Murphy‚Äôs third season at the helm started off with his third straight major freshman acquisition as he recruited Dennis Williams to play Tiger men‚Äôs basketball. He also picked up Randy Terry, who was a prospect from Jones County Junior College, to replace Smith at shooting guard. Terry was a native of nearby Tuscaloosa and known for his phenomenal shooting ability. That season was a huge step in the right direction for LU basketball. Williams, Cotchery, Andre, and Terry formed a solid core, which carried the team to a 19-9 season. Cotchery and Andre received First Team All-GSC Conference honors. Williams was named the GSC Freshman of the Year. Murphy was named the GSC Coach of the Year. Although the team was successful, they still finished third in the conference and failed to reach the NCAA tournament for a third straight season. The team finally struck gold in the 1981‚Äì82 season, finishing 20-10 and winning the GSC championship for the first time in school history. Cotchery was named the tournament MVP. He also earned First Team All-GSC Conference honors along with teammates Randy Terry and Marvin Wesley. Murphy was once again named GSC Coach of the Year. The conference championship earned LU their first trip back to the NCAA Division II Men‚Äôs Basketball Tournament since 1978. In similar fashion to their last NCAA tournament trip, the South Regional was once again hosted by a Florida school. This time around, it was Florida Southern. Their appearance in the tournament also had an atmosphere of d√©j√† vu. The Tigers first game was against Biscayne College, who was also a local team. Despite the crowd being heavily behind BC, this time around, LU was greatly prepared for the challenges and obstacles they faced. Cotchery and the gang fought from beginning to end as they walked away with a 75-72 victory. The victory earned the Tigers a regional match-up against host and defending Division II national champions. It would go down as one of the best games in NCAA Division II Men‚Äôs Basketball Tournament history. Both teams were locked in a defensive battle for most of the game. FSU carried a desire to repeat as champions and refused to lose on their home court. LU, on the other hand, was trying to earn their first ever NCAA championship in school history. The game eventually went into three overtimes. After a long and hard-fought battle, FSU came out victorious 86-79. That game would mark the last NCAA tournament appearance to date for LU. With the departures of Andre and Terry, Cotchery carried the team on his back during his senior season. The team finished with an 18‚Äì9 record and runner-up finish in the GSC. Cotchery earned another First Team conference honor. That season would also be the last at LU for Murphy who resigned at the end of the 1982-1983 campaign to take over at GSC rival Delta State. He coached LU for five seasons. Murphy is currently ranked second in the school‚Äôs record book with 86 wins coaching and 41 GSC victories. Two years after Murphy‚Äôs departure, former assistant coach Rick Reedy took over the program in time for the 1984‚Äì85 season. Former Tiger standout Tony Andre also joined him as an assistant coach. After three dismal seasons to start his career at the helm, Reedy got the Tigers going in a positive direction during the 1987‚Äì88 season. The team finished 18-9 and tied for fifth place in the GSC. Over the years, Reedy became known as a good recruiter as he brought many talented players to Livingston. A majority of those players currently hold accomplishments in the UWA record book. Despite the talent, Reedy only had eight winning seasons during his 23 seasons as the coach. Also, during his tenure, the team finished in the GSC top 3 only three times. In 1993, the Gulf South Conference underwent a huge expansion with the addition of ten new members. The change allowed the GSC to divide into two separate divisions called East and West. For two years, the Tigers were a part of the West division. They moved to the East after Arkansas-Monticello, Southern Arkansas, Arkansas Tech, and Montevallo joined the conference in 1995. Also, Jacksonville State and Mississippi College departed, thus leaving the conference with 18 members. Reedy‚Äôs best conference record came during 1992-1993 when they earned an 8-4 record and finished as the GSC runner-up. In the 1991‚Äì92 season, the Tigers earned the school's largest margin of victory with a 61-point win over Selma. The 2004-2005 team finished a game over .500 at 14-13, which was the last winning season for the Tigers. In Reedy's final season, the team finished 10-17. The 23 seasons he spent at the helm earned him the honor of UWA‚Äôs longest-tenured men‚Äôs basketball coach. Upon retirement, he ranked first in the UWA history books with 276 overall wins and 116 of those coming in conference play. After nearly a quarter century, a new face emerged as Eddie McCarter was hired to take Reedy's place. McCarter‚Äôs first recruiting class featured Ryan Cross and Daniel Scott. Both were on the list of Alabama‚Äôs top players. However, academics put a damper in their recruitment. McCarter also brought along Roderick Ollie from UAB. All three were red-shirted their first season. Overall, the roster was made up of mostly new faces and a few holdovers from the Reedy era. The McCarter era began on the road at Stillman where UWA registered an 88-82 win. It became apparent after a while that the season was one of rebuilding. With a lack of team chemistry and other issues, the team finished with a 10-17 mark. The Tigers saw improvement in McCarter‚Äôs second season. However, the roster was once again filled with new faces. Cross and fellow redshirt freshman Jacquezz Brown left the team. Ollie, Maurice Naylor, Glenn Miles, and Kevin Johnson left the team as well. The biggest acquisition was Troy native Jason Swanson. Swanson had previously played at nearby Shelton State Community College where he was a two-year starter. The 6'7\\" forward averaged 16.8 points a game and was also known for his rebounding, which was an area McCarter heavily emphasized. Brian Murphy, the Tigers leading scorer in 2007-2008, suffered a torn ACL before the season and was given a medical redshirt. His injury left McCarter in need of a new go to scorer which he had hoped to find in newcomers Herman Mains, Jamaine Nance, Terrence Benson and Chris Davis. UWA had an up and down start to the season. The team could never find a consistence rhythm. In similar fashion to McCarter‚Äôs first year as the coach, the team never developed a strong chemistry, and it strongly showed once again on the court. Despite that, the Tigers finished the regular season 13-13 and clinched their first GSC tournament appearance since the 1997‚Äì98 season. The excitement was short lived as Harding eliminated UWA in the opening round. McCarter added nine and returned five for the 2009-2010 campaign. The team also featured three redshirt freshmen. McCarter also once again lost several key players who decided to transfer including Daniel Scott. This year‚Äôs squad was noticeably much improved over the two previous teams. However, they never played up to potential. The Tigers carried the momentum and a lead in almost every game they lost but was often defeated after their opponent staged a late rally. Swanson led the team most of the way leading them in almost every category. Newcomers Richard Sirju and Alquan Mendenhall also gave the team a major lift. The season also saw the emergence of redshirt freshman Ryan Fitch. Fitch broke into the starting lineup a couple games into the season. McCarter will likely look to replace Jason Swanson going into the next season. The Tigers concluded this year‚Äôs season with a 13‚Äì14 record. However, after a loss to Alabama- Huntsville during the season's final game, UWA was eliminated from earning a second straight berth in the GSC tournament. Swanson earned First Team All-GSC honors which occurred for the first team since 2005 when Stan Gill received the honor. The 2010-2011 campaign opened with a home match-up against Carver Bible College. Alquan Mendenhall, Jonathan Griffin, Ryan Fitch, and Richard Dixon led the scoring as each topped double figures in the opening triumph. The Tigers dropped their first road game at Jacksonville State but posted consecutive home wins over Huntingdon and Concordia. UWA moved to 3-1 but endured a rough stretch to close out 2010. The team faced each team from the Gulf South Conference West Division and came away with a pair of wins. The men came up short to Georgia Southwestern to kick off 2011 in the second to last non-conference game of the season. The Tigers went 4‚Äì6 to open conference play including a road thriller at West Florida. The win was the team's first season sweep of the Argonauts since 1996‚Äì1997. They stepped out of the GSC to face Oakwood and were victorious in that one, posting 90 points to rout their opponent. A few days later, the men knocked off West Georgia and concluded the season hosting Valdosta State. The Tigers fell by two points to finish their season 11‚Äì15 overall and 5‚Äì7 in the Gulf South Conference. In April 2011, the Department of Athletics announced the hiring of Mike Newell to take over the reins of the program. In July 2013, UWA announced the hiring of Mark Downey. The winner of two Gulf South Conference championships while at Arkansas Tech and a six-time coach of the year winner in nine seasons as a head coach, Downey comes to UWA from the University of Charleston. In only three seasons at Charleston, he compiled a 60-28 record and led the Golden Eagles to their first NCAA Tournament Appearance since 2001. In nine seasons at Charleston (2010-2013), Arkansas Tech (2006-2010) and Independence Community College (1999-2001), Downey is the owner of a 184-92 record. He has averaged just over 20 wins per season and has just one losing season. He has a 19-5 record in post-season NCAA Division II conference tournaments. Downey has coached in eight conference tournaments, reaching the finals five times and winning three conference titles.  Women's basketball  The first known University of West Alabama women's basketball team is currently unknown. However, detailed season results first became available for the 1978‚Äì79 season. That year, the Tigers struggled to a 5-16 mark. The following three years provided many highlights for the program when the women went on a hot streak. During 1979-1980, the team put up 24 wins to only 12 losses. 1980-1981 got even better when UWA tallied a 25-4 overall record. The Tigers won 12 of their final 13 games and collected an impressive 11-game winning streak. The old saying, \\"third time's a charm\\" rang true in 1981-1982. The program set a school record collecting 30 wins to only seven defeats. The team fought hard all year, and it showed because of the seven losses, five came by 10 points or less. The 30-win season ranks first in the history books to this day. The successful season also saw UWA claim the GSC Championship. Afterwards, a cold snap rendered the Tigers' chances the next couple of seasons before more achievements were reached. The 1985-1986 campaign opened with six straight wins en route to an 18-9 record for UWA. Another outstanding year followed suit in 1986-1987 as the women totaled 19 victories. The winning ways returned to campus after the team brushed the .500 mark a few seasons later. Over the course of the next three seasons, the Tigers tallied 51 wins and saw defeat only 29 times. The 20-win plateau was achieved in 1997-1998 for the first time since the school's 30-win year. Amanda Marks came on board in 2001-2002 leading UWA to another historic year. UWA's first-ever berth in the NCAA Tournament came this year. With a 22-6 overall record and 14-2 mark in the GSC, the Tigers claimed the East Division championship. They headed to the tournament and picked up their first win there since 1987. Although they lost their next tournament game to Delta State, they were rewarded with a trip to the NCAA Regional. A last-second shot rimmed out at the buzzer ending a magical run in Marks' first season. The team finished below .500 the next season but rebounded in 2003-2004 to notch another 22-win season. Marks earned her 150th career win in a matchup against Alabama-Huntsville. UWA claimed the fifth spot in the season's initial South Region rankings. The Tigers earned another East Division championship by virtue of a 12-2 conference record. They travelled to Rollins to take part in the NCAA Tournament and played a different hand this time around making history in the process. UWA garnered their first ever NCAA win narrowly escaping against Christian Brothers in overtime. Unfortunately, the season came to a close at the hands of Rollins when they fell short 63-45. The 2006‚Äì07 season looked to be another promising year with the women getting off to a hot start. They were 12-3 through 15 games, but a late season collapse and early tournament exit ended a 19-9 year. Marks tallied career win #200 with a road win at Montevallo. The Tigers could not get past .500 either of the following years. The 2009‚Äì10 season was a rebuilding year for the Tigers. After struggling early on, UWA ended the regular season on a high note winning six of their final eight. The women finished 5-5 in GSC action and qualified for the conference tournament. After trailing by only seven at halftime, the Tigers could not overcome a tough Delta State squad. Their season concluded with an overall record of 9-19. Latashia Greer was named the East Division's Co-Player of the Year and became the program's first-ever player to receive the honor. Craig Roden took over for Amanda Marks for the 2010‚Äì11 season. An alum of the University, Roden came back for his second stint as head coach. He previously led the squad in the 1980s. The season began with a home matchup against Barry from the Sunshine State Conference in a region game. UWA came away with an eight-point win to turn away the Buccaneers. The Tigers went on to post three more victories to start the season 4-0. In the third game, UWA upset #1 ranked Arkansas Tech in Livingston. The women almost pulled off another upset but fell by two to #1 ranked Delta State at home. The team dropped their following game to Talladega College before reeling off ten straight wins. With their win over West Florida in January 2011, the Tigers improved to 14-2, the best record after 16 games in program history. UWA posted a 4-6 record to close out regular season play and claimed the East Division's third seed. They opened the Gulf South Conference Tournament against West Division two seed Delta State but dropped a tough four-point decision. The squad posted an 18-9 overall record and went 6-6 in conference action. Mystee Dale, a transfer from East Central Community College in Mississippi, dazzled for UWA posting several accomplishments during the season. She garnered six Player of the Week accolades, the most of any player in the entire conference. Dale was named the GSC Player of the Year and led the conference in scoring with an impressive 21.2 points per game. She connected on almost 87 percent of her free throw attempts, which was also the highest mark in the GSC. Dale also finished in the top ten of seven other statistical categories. Latasha Greer and LaShandra McCoy also shined by putting up effective statistics to aid the turnaround from a year ago. Dale was also named to the Daktronics All-South Region team. She was further recognized as UWA's first-ever All-American in the NCAA era. In 2011-12 UWA won the Gulf South Conference tournament. The 2012‚Äì13 season was hurt by injuries to key players but the team was still able to make the championship game of the conference tournament. Brittany Weathers and Nikkia Jordan were both selected as all first team GSC players.  Spring sports   Baseball  The University of West Alabama baseball team is arguably the school's best sport. It started in the 1940s, but the first season results were not printed until the 1964 season. That year, the Tigers finished two games over .500 at 12‚Äì10. At this time, records are not known for the 1965‚Äì67 seasons. The following six years were all winning seasons, and UWA won 153 games out of 211 for a .725 percentage. They closed out the 1970s with only two losing seasons. After dominating the previous decade, the team ran into speed bumps during the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the team returned to their winning ways going 30-24 in 1990 and 32-13-1 in 1991. 1992 proved to be one of the most historic seasons in school history for a number of reasons. That year, UWA notched 37 wins, which was a school record at the time. They also brought the first GSC Championship trophy to Livingston. The highlights did not stop there as the Tigers earned a bid to the South Central Regional. A close win over rival North Alabama in the regional championship sent UWA to its only Division II College World Series. Their chances for the school's first baseball national championship ended in tough luck as they dropped two of three games. The current head coach for the Tigers is Gary Rundles. He took the reins beginning in 2001 and has been instrumental in his tenure at UWA. He led the team to a .500 finish his first year and encountered his only losing season in 2002. The 2000s without question were the school's best decade. In 2003, the Tigers pulled off one of the greatest upsets in school history. They rallied from a seven-run deficit to knock off #20 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The Tigers finished 2003 with a 31-24 record and improved that to 33-22 in 2004. In 2005, memories from the 1992 season returned as the team had a record-setting year. They earned their second GSC Championship and like before, it was done against North Alabama. The Tigers earned the automatic bid to the South Central Regional, but their run abruptly ended the season at 45-19. UWA came close to repeating in 2006 but lost to Southern Arkansas in the final inning. At the South Central Regional, the Tigers knocked out top seed Abilene Christian. The following day, the team was eliminated by Incarnate Word. UWA's record wound up at 42-22. During the season, the Tigers set a school record dismantling Lincoln Memorial with a program-best 29 runs in one game. 2007 saw UWA claim the East championship at 14‚Äì4 in the division and another berth in the GSC Championship. However, it was not enough as West Florida took the honors cutting the season short at 41-16. Another monumental season came during 2008 as more records were either tied or broken. The season's highlight was when UWA earned the school's highest ranking ever at #2 in the nation. After an early exit from the GSC Tournament, the team saw its season come to an end in the South Central Regional. However, with a 45-13 mark, they became the first program in the Gulf South Conference to have four consecutive 40-win seasons. UWA's record during that span was 173-70 for a .712 winning percentage. In 2009, the Tigers knocked off #1 Tampa and later reeled off a 12-game winning streak. During that streak, Gary Rundles claimed his 300th win with the program. They went on to clinch the East Division title with a 14-2 conference record. At the NCAA South Regional, the team ousted Barry but ultimately fell short to Southern Arkansas. UWA closed the 2010 season on a high note by winning their last four and ending the year 26-17 overall. The Tigers endured a rough 2011 season finishing at 19-22. The team's finish was the first time in nine years that the team failed to have a winning season.  Softball  The first-ever University of West Alabama fast-pitch softball team was christened in 1986. The Tigers managed to win only one game during their inaugural season. After Wayne Dees left, Liz Kelley took over leading the team to a 17-25 record in 1987. For her efforts, she claimed Gulf South Conference Coach of the Year honors. Liz Kelley then left to take a similar position at Miami University in Ohio. Janet Koenig (later Janet Montgomery), a 1986 graduate of Wisconsin-Parkside, was selected as the new head coach. The next four years would be some of the best the program would see in their history. UWA won four consecutive GSC Championship crowns from 1988 through 1991. During this span, the Tigers were an outstanding 146-62 for a .701 winning percentage. In 1991, five team members were named to the GSC Spring Sports All-Academic Team. They not only succeeded in the classroom but also on the field with dominating statistics. In 1992, the #16 ranked Tigers swept a doubleheader from #12 Valdosta State and played a hard-fought championship game. Unfortunately, they could not pick up their fifth consecutive GSC championship falling 1-0 to Jacksonville State. The next four seasons proved tough for the team as they encountered losing records and hovered around the .500 mark. However, in 1995, the team swept through the GSC Tournament field to notch their fifth tournament title. The 1997 season brought many highlights as UWA dominated the GSC Tournament to win their sixth crown. The Tigers then received news they had been selected to play in the South Regional. It was the program's first and only berth in the NCAA Tournament. UWA made the trip to Miami Shores on the campus of Barry. After posting a 1-2 record, their season came to a close with 32 wins to only 18 losses. During the 1999 season, UWA dropped the first game of a doubleheader to Mississippi University for Women. They rebounded in the second game with a no-hitter to knock off their opponent in a low-scoring affair. The Tigers encountered tough seasons from 2000 to 2006. Janet Montgomery's final season as head coach came in 2007. She led the team to a 26-33 record and then took over athletic duties as associate athletic director. Assistant head coach Will Atkinson was promoted to take over the program in 2008. In his first season, UWA finished at .500 with a 29-29 mark. In the Tigers' regular season finale, they rallied to knock off #2 Alabama-Huntsville at the UWA Softball Complex. The season's other highlight came when Brittany McGee tossed the program's first-ever perfect game. Seven players earned conference honors for their season efforts. When 2009 rolled around, the highlights kept on coming in Will Atkinson's second year. The Tigers recorded their best start ever at 25-2 steamrolling several opponents along the way. During the remarkable run, they put together two seven-game winning streaks and an 11-game winning streak. When conference play started, the team encountered a few speed bumps when facing University of West Florida and Alabama-Huntsville. UWA got hot again at the annual GSC Crossover in Decatur. The Tigers posted a 6-1 record against West Division foes falling only to Arkansas-Monticello. After a fourth-place finish in the East Division, the team made their first appearance at the GSC Tournament since 1997. In a rain-shortened tournament, their season concluded with a loss to Arkansas Tech. UWA tied the school record for wins with a 42-17 record and placed six players on the All-GSC squad. Also, the team's 12 conference wins equaled the school record, and 80 home runs broke a school record. That number was good for third in the GSC and sixth in the entire country. The Tigers posted a 38-23 record for the 2010 season. In 2011, UWA won the NCAA South Two Regional to advance to the school's first ever South Super Regional at Alabama- Huntsville. The team posted impressive wins over Rollins, Tampa, and Arkansas- Monticello. The Tigers defeated two top 15 teams in succession to set up their regional title game berth. After claiming game 1 in the best-of-three series, the Tigers fell short to end their dream season at 38-19.  Men's and women's tennis  The University of West Alabama men's tennis team began in 1974. The women followed suit a decade later in 1984. Both programs were dropped in 1997. After an eight-year hiatus, the Tigers were reinstated in the fall of 2005. The Howard R. Vaughan Tennis Complex was added to the University campus in time for UWA to begin the 2006 season. Rod Hartzog was chosen as the head coach and went right to work recruiting players. After a grueling schedule, both teams had many wins to show for their efforts. The season's highlight came when the Tigers swept Alabama-Huntsville, and the women dispatched Montevallo in fine fashion at the GSC Jamboree. In 2007, as part of Super Tiger Day festivities, the men and women both claimed victories over Transylvania. Spring Break saw the Tigers match up against several nationally ranked opponents. UWA fought hard in each match but could not come up with a win in any of them. The women's final match came at Montevallo where they picked up their only conference win. Their season ended at 5-12 overall, 1-4 in the conference. The UWA men concluded their season at the GSC Tournament to close a 7-11 mark and 1-3 in GSC action. After two short seasons as head coach, Rod Hartzog resigned paving the way for Glen Fanelli to take over as head coach. In 2008, both the men and women got off to impressive starts. After seven matches, UWA's men stood undefeated, while the women had only dropped one match. The teams' first conference action took them to Alabama- Huntsville. The Tigers fought hard and came away with close 5-4 margins in both matches. The rest of GSC action proved difficult as division foes Valdosta State and West Florida were both ranked in the nation's top 5. In the initial NCAA South Region rankings, the Tiger women placed sixth with the women right behind at seventh. Both teams went on to qualify for the GSC Tournament where UWA's women made their first-ever appearance. Unfortunately, they dropped both of their matches, but the Tiger men picked up a win against Harding in the consolation semi-finals. Glen Fanelli's first season came to an end as he led both teams to winning records. On the women's side, they posted a school-record 15 wins. The men followed close behind with 13 victories to their credit. A conference road trip sent UWA to Pensacola for the 2009 opener where the Tigers dropped matches to nationally ranked West Florida. Both the men and women notched wins in their home openers against Mississippi College. UWA then hit the road again for a tough ten-match span. Along the way, they faced several region opponents and had much success. The Tiger men won their first nine before dropping the finale to a tough Columbus State squad. The women picked up four victories, and both teams returned to Livingston after several days away from campus. In front of their home crowd, the Tigers picked up key wins and turned back Missouri-St. Louis. The regular season concluded with a four-match homestand and two makeup matches in Tennessee. UWA's men and women both swept region opponents Stillman and Tuskegee in 9-0 fashion. For the second consecutive year, the women returned to the GSC Tournament, but the men did not earn a bid. Despite their efforts, the Tiger women ended the season just under the .500 mark at 14-15. The men's squad received a bid to the NCAA South Regional for the first time in school history. The excitement was short lived when Rollins eliminated them, but their 18-7 record set a school record for wins. In the 2010 slate, the women finished at 16-11 overall, as the men are 18-9 and have earned their second consecutive NCAA Tournament bid. With a 2-2 conference record, the Tiger women earned their third consecutive berth in the GSC Tournament. Their 16 wins set a school record for wins in a season breaking the mark set in 2008. The UWA men earned the program's first win in NCAA Tournament action with a close win over Alabama-Huntsville in the South Regional. The win also broke a school record for victories in a season as the men recorded their 19th on the year. In 2011, the Tiger men finished with a 14-9 overall mark. The women's squad eclipsed their 16 wins in 2010 by earning a 17-9 record and going 2-2 in conference action. 2012 saw the women's team continue their improvement with a 19-9 overall mark and 3-4 in the conference. The 2012 men finished with a milestone season of 23-4 including a 5-2 mark in the GSC. The team won 17 straight matches during the season and qualified for the South Regional at Lynn University.  Other sports   Men's and women's cross country  Dr. Donald Medeiros serves as the head men's and women's cross country coach. He took over both programs in February 2006. The first University of West Alabama cross country teams made their way to campus in 1997. Early in their inaugural campaign, the teams took part in the Delta State Cross Country Invitational. Both teams put up great efforts as the men finished third, and the women earned a fourth place nod. The entire men's team and two of the women all posted top 25 finishes at the file-mile event. At this time, results from the 1998‚Äì2004 seasons are unavailable. 2005 opened at the Argo Invitational in Pensacola where the Tiger men garnered 101 points overall. The women's team was unable to compete due to injuries. The season concluded at the GSC Championships with an 11th place nod on the men's side and a 16th-place finish for the women at the GSC Championships. In the spring of 2006, Dr. Don Medeiros came on board as the program's first-ever full-time head coach. UWA tallied fourth-place finishes for both teams as the men earned 104 points, and the women followed suit at 105. At the NCAA South Regional in Memphis, the Tigers picked up 14th and 22nd-place finishes. Three new members came on board in time for 2007. Two were from the state of Georgia, and the other was from Mississippi. The season commenced in fine fashion at the Southern Mississippi Invitational when UWA's men won the event. The highlights did not stop there as six Tiger individuals earned top 25 times. The Tiger women were equally impressive as they raked in third place. At the Mississippi State Invitational, UWA continued their hot start with a runner-up finish. Two players received All-GSC honors to lead the men's team to a 13th-place finish at the NCAA South Regional. When 2008 rolled around, the NCAA awarded the program a Coaching Enhancement Grant and was one of only 18 Division II schools nationwide to receive the honor. With that, Erin Heeder was hired as assistant head coach for the women's team. A host of new faces for both teams kicked off the year at Mississippi College. Both squads were successful in their openers as the men and women completed the event in third and fourth, respectively. Later, at the Auburn Invitational, their hard work paid off again with the Tiger men placing sixth and the women earning ninth place. At the GSC Championships in Hoover, the men of UWA were awarded sixth, while the women tallied a program-best 10th place. Each team put the finishing touches on an exciting season at the NCAA South Regional. A top-10 finish for the men and 13th place nod on the women's side closed the door on yet another successful season. In 2009, the success kept on rolling in for the Tigers. In their first action at Southern Mississippi, the Tiger men outran their opponents to post first place honors. UWA's women captured third at the event to get their season off to a good start as well. A strong showing a few weeks later saw both squads finish in fourth at Mississippi State. They almost knocked off their conference opponent Alabama-Huntsville. In Jacksonville at the Jacksonville State Foothills Invitational, the Tigers improved upon their previous marks by both posting third. At the conference championship run, the women earned their highest ever finish in program history at fifth place. The men followed close behind as they returned home in seventh place. The 2009 season wrapped up in Tampa as both sets of Tigers took part in the NCAA South Regional. Men's and women's golf In the fall of 2013 UWA started fielded men's and women's golf teams. Adam Buie was hired as the school's first ever head coach. Buie came to UWA from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, where he was on the UNCP staff for both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs golf. He helped guide the Braves to 11 women‚Äôs team tournament wins and six men‚Äôs tournament victories. UNC Pembroke produced numerous all-conference, All- Americans and academic All-Americans during his tenure there. Men's and women's outdoor track In the spring of 2013 UWA begin competition in both men's and women's outdoor track. Dr. Don Medeiros also serves as the head coach for these programs as well.  Men's and women's rodeo  The University of West Alabama rodeo teams were established in 1995. Their first- ever event took them to Southern Arkansas. David Rickman, a native of Tennessee was introduced by the University of West Alabama Trustees to lead the program. The first teams were made up of 22 members including 17 men and five women. The early stages of the rodeo arena began thanks in large part to boosters donating around $60,000. In April 1998, UWA competed at the Abraham- Baldwin Agricultural College Rodeo in Tifton, Georgia. Both the men's and women's teams racked in first-place finishes at the event. The men picked up 338 points, and the women earned 310 total. A number of Tiger wranglers posted good showings in their respective events. A few seasons later, the rodeo teams took part in a regional rodeo showdown in Enid, Oklahoma. They faced qualifying teams from the Central Plains Region and put up very respectable numbers. The UWA women ended the event in fourth place out of 20 teams. The men were equally impressive and also placed fourth but out of 23 teams. Head coach Jayson Schoenfeld commented that he was satisfied with each team's performances. Both teams went on later that year to compete at the College National Finals Rodeo in Casper, Wyoming. The following campaign, more highlights came for the Tiger wranglers. UWA's men raked in back-to-back first place honors with the women following suit in impressive fashion. Everyone on both teams chipped in to aid the cause and lead the Tigers to their good finishes. During the summer of 2005, UWA competed at the College National Finals Rodeo in Casper with an outstanding turnout. Seven players in all took part in the event. The Tigers' regional placings propelled them to the finals with four women and three men making the long road trip. Every year, the people of Livingston get the unique opportunity to attend a rodeo in Livingston. This is because the Tiger wranglers host the UWA College Rodeo Showdown at the Don C. Hines Rodeo Complex. Teams from all over make their way to Livingston for the annual event. As they had in 2005, the Tigers made the trek back to Casper for the College National Finals Rodeo. The men garnered a 15th-place finish with the women at 32nd. UWA brought a second-place finish in the nation back to Livingston for the bull riding event. The steer wrestling event saw a solid fourth-place finish. On the women's side, the Tigers posted 12th place in barrel racing. Chad Phipps served as head coach from 2007-2013. An avid rodeo player throughout high school, Phipps was offered a scholarship to the University of Tennessee-Martin. In 2001 and 2002, he received special recognition from the team when he received MVP honors. A native of Dalton, Georgia, his career was cut short when a bull stepped on him. Although he can no longer compete in bull riding, that did not keep him away from the sport. After Jayson Schoenfeld left, he took over the Tiger wrangler program at UWA. Since the inception of rodeo on the University campus, the Tiger women have won the Ozark Region championship five times. The men have been runner-up three years. Both teams finished in fifth place for the 2009 season. They take part in ten events a year, five coming in the fall and the other five during the spring semester. Although the Tigers have seen their share of highlights, the University community lost one of their own in mid-2009. Dr. Don C. Hines died on August 26 after battling cancer. Dr. Hines made significant contributions during his tenure at UWA, most notably bringing rodeo to campus. The rodeo complex on campus is named in his honor. After the fall semester, the UWA men have picked up 1,840 total points and sit in third place in the Ozark Region. The Tiger women stake 315 points to their claim for a seventh place mark. With a 9.9 in the final round, UWA freshman Zach Wilson won the national championship in tie down roping at the College National Finals Rodeo at the Casper Events Center. From Billingsley, Ala., Wilson posted an average of 38.1 and scored 185 points. Justin Caylor currently serves as Interim Head Coach after being assistant coach for two seasons. Caylor, a 2011 UWA graduate, was a member of the rodeo team while at UWA.  Athletic facilities  The University of West Alabama has several facilities on campus including outdoor stadiums and an indoor arena as well as training and practice facilities. They are as follows: *Tiger Stadium is the home of the Tiger football team since 1952, but renovations have been completed in recent years. The home side contains concrete bleachers and red chairback seats for fans who purchase reserved tickets or season passes. A new scoreboard was added on the right side a few years back. The Tiger Room, a place for Tiger Club members, is located underneath the bleachers. Concessions can be found behind the bleachers on the home side. The stadium saw a major renovation as a synthetic surface was recently installed. The women's soccer program will play their home games at the stadium beginning in fall 2011. *James P.

Richard Henry was born in Philadelphia, and as a young man founded a civil rights organization there with his brother Milton. The two later moved to Detroit. After the murder of Malcolm X, they helped form the Malcolm X Society and, dissatisfied by the progress achieved by nonviolent approaches to civil rights movement, came to embrace black separatism. Richard and Milton adopted the African names Imari and Gaidi Obadele in 1968, and with others, founded the Republic of New Afrika. At the meeting founding the group, they formed a \\"government in exile\\". Obadele was designated the information minister, and soon published a pamphlet \\"War in America\\". The organization's stated aim was to carve Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina out of the United States and establish an independent black nation from these five states. The Republic of New Afrika also formed a paramilitary unit, the Black Legion. In 1969, the unit was involved in a gun battle in Detroit that killed a police officer. Imari split from his brother, who came to reject militancy, in 1970, and was also elected president of the Republic of New Afrika. Obadele and the group moved its headquarters to a house in Jackson, Mississippi, despite failing to purchase an plot. Obadele and ten others (the \\"RNA 11\\") were arrested and charged in the wake of a joint police / FBI raid on the house in 1971. The raid culminated in a gunfight that killed an officer. It was later determined that Obadele was not at the scene, and murder charges against him were dropped. However, he was convicted of conspiracy to assault a federal agent and was sentenced to twelve years in prison (of which he served five). Amnesty International described him as a political prisoner, and the group claimed that it had been targeted by the FBI because of its political views. FBI documentation that was later released confirmed that the agency was following the group. Internal FBI memos suggested that Obadele \\"be kept off the streets\\" and that he was one of the country's \\"most violence-prone black extremists\\". After prison, Obadele went on to earn a PhD in political science from Temple University. He became a professor at Prairie View A&M; University. His stepson is Ivory A. Toldson.

First described in 1845 on the basis of a single specimen, it may be the same as the Noronha skink (T. atlantica) from Fernando de Noronha, off northeastern Brazil. T. tschudii represents one of two doubtful records of the otherwise African genus Trachylepis on mainland South America; the other is T. maculata from Guyana. The only specimen, the holotype, is mostly brownish above, with dark and light spots, and white below. The snout-to-vent length is 83 mm (3.3 in). Several features of the scales align it with Trachylepis over the related American genus Mabuya. Taxonomy In 1845, Swiss zoologist Johann Jakob von Tschudi described the new species Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata among other species he had collected in Peru. The species was recorded as being from the \\"forest region\\" (Amazonia) of Peru and was known from a single specimen, the holotype. In 1887, G.A. Boulenger placed it at an uncertain position within the genus Mabuia, which included Tschudi's Trachylepis.Boulenger, 1887, p. 150 In a 1907 reappraisal of some of Tschudi's reptiles and amphibians, J. Roux redescribed punctata under the name \\"Mabuia punctata\\", but did not comment on its affinities.Roux, 1907, pp. 300-302 In 1935, E.R. Dunn reviewed some American Mabuya and commented that he was unable to tell the identity of punctata, but that it probably was not a true Mabuya.Dunn, 1935, p. 557 Writing in 1946, H. Travassos considered Tschudi's punctata to be identical to the Noronha skink (then known as Mabuya punctata), a species otherwise known only from Fernando de Noronha, a small archipelago off northeastern Brazil.Travassos, 1946, p. 7 On the basis of its geographic origin, J. Peters and R. Donoso-Barros preferred to place it with one of the Mabuya species of Amazonia and classified it as a junior synonym of Mabuya mabouya. In reviewing the nomenclature of the Noronha skink, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic noted in 2002 that Tschudi's name punctata was preoccupied within Mabuya, making it unavailable for use as a valid name. They were unable to examine the holotype and therefore did not comment on its affinities.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 293 In the same year, Mausfeld and others split the genus Mabuya, retaining most American species in Mabuya but placing the African species and the Noronha skink in a separate genus Euprepis;Mausfeld et al., 2002, p. 290 the latter name was later corrected to Trachylepis.Bauer, 2003, p. 5 In 2009, A. Miralles and others reviewed Tschudi's species and re-examined the holotype. Like Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, they noted that the name punctata is preoccupied; earlier uses of the name in Trachylepis include Lacerta punctata Linnaeus, 1758, which they consider a synonym of Trachylepis homalocephala from South Africa, and Tiliqua punctata J.E. Gray, 1839, an earlier name for the Noronha skink. (The former was assigned to Lygosoma punctatum, a member of another skink genus, by Bauer in 2003.)Bauer, 2003, p. 4 Miralles and coworkers proposed a new name, Trachylepis tschudii, to replace Tschudi's name punctata; the new name honors Tschudi, who first described the animal. They assigned it to the genus Trachylepis, rather than Mabuya, on the basis of several characters of the external anatomy which it shares with the former, but were unable to resolve its placement within Trachylepis. It is distinct from T. maculata, a species recorded from Guyana that represents another doubtful mainland South American record of Trachylepis. They considered three hypotheses: (1) T. tschudii is a real, but very rare species from Amazonia; (2) T. tschudii is actually from somewhere in the Old World, but its origin was wrongly recorded; and (3) T. tschudii represents the same species as the Noronha skink, and it either represents an otherwise unknown Amazonian population of that species or actually comes from Fernando de Noronha and was mislabeled. Considering the close similarity between T. tschudii and the Noronha skink, they considered the third hypothesis to be most likely. Description The Noronha skink may be the same species as Trachylepis tschudii. The holotype and only known specimen, which is in very poor condition, is preserved in the Museum d'Histoire Naturel de Neuch√¢tel as specimen MHNN 91.2426. It has five auricular lobules in front of the ears on each side of the head, 39 rows of scales around the midbody, keels on its dorsal scales, and the third supraocular scale in contact with the frontal scale, all characters which align it with Trachylepis rather than Mabuya. The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T. maculata, has five instead of three keels, 32 to 34 midbody scales, and separated parietal scales. T. tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers of scales, and discrete characters, such as having the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.Miralles et al., 2009, p. 58 The muzzle is narrow and long. The lower eyelid contains a large, transparent disk. The head is olive-brown. There are black scales with a white border between the eyes and the ears. The body is somewhat darker than the head and covered with irregular black and white spots above and is bluish white below. The limbs are yellowish white below. The tail is light brown above, but has two rows of darker spots, and yellowish white below.Roux, 1907, pp. 301-302 Snout-to-vent length is 83 mm (3.3 in), head length 10 mm (0.39 in), head width 6.5 mm (0.26 in), length of the body 33 mm (1.3 in), length of the forelimb 15 mm (0.59 in), length of the hindlimb 23 mm (0.91 in), and length of the (incomplete) tail 40 mm (1.6 in).Roux, 1907, p. 302; Miralles et al., 2009, p. 58 Footnotes References Literature cited *Bauer AM (2003). \\"On the identity of Lacerta punctata Linnaeus 1758, the type species of the genus Euprepis Wagler 1830, and the generic assignment of Afro-Malagasy skinks\\".

His best-remembered recordings are \\"Creepin' Blues\\" and \\"Some People Say\\". Biography Seward, one of fourteen siblings, was born in Charles City County, Virginia. Like Gabriel Brown, Ralph Willis and Brownie McGhee, he relocated from the South to New York, in his case in 1924. Seward befriended Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry and retained his Piedmont blues styling despite changes in musical trends. He and the blues musician Louis Hayes (who later became a minister in northern New Jersey) performed together, variously billed as the Blues Servant Boys, Guitar Slim and Jelly Belly, and the Back Porch Boys. During the 1940s and 1950s Seward played and recorded with Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, McGhee and Terry. Around 1947 Seward, Guthrie, and Terry recorded several chain gang songs, including \\"Chain Gang Special\\", and some other older songs adapted to having chain gang themes. They were later released on the compilation album Best of the War Years. Under his own name, Seward issued Creepin' Blues (1965, Bluesville), with harmonica accompaniment by Larry Johnson.

The Beatles tried to prevent the album's publication, but it was released in the United Kingdom on 30 July 1976 under the Polydor label (catalogue number 2683 068) and in the United States in 1978. Topics Major topics in John Lennon's interview include his relationship with Yoko Ono, his peace activism, The Beatles' business affairs (a portion of his statement about Brian Epstein's management is on Anthology 1), the nature of God, and the band's break-up and whether they would reunite musically. Among Paul McCartney's topics are fatherhood, his favourite songs from Abbey Road, why The Beatles appeared at only one Royal Variety Performance, and the composition of \\"Golden Slumbers\\". Shortly after his interview, McCartney met with the other Beatles to decide whether Allen Klein or Lee Eastman would handle the group's affairs. Having failed to persuade the other Beatles to choose Eastman, McCartney \\"stormed out of the meeting, resigning from the Apple board\\".Liner notes, The Beatles Tapes from the David Wigg Interviews, David Wigg, 1976.

Her films have been screened at important film festivals such as Annecy, Tribeca, Sundance, Berlin, Ottawa, Venice and they have received numerous awards. In 2017, Baumane was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship for her exceptional creative ability in the arts.  Rocks in My Pockets  Baumane's animation Rocks in My Pockets is a feature- length autobiographical animation that explores the depression that has haunted three generations of women in her family. Rocks in My Pockets was selected as the Latvian entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards but was not nominated. The project received early funding from NYSCA, The Jerome Foundation, and Women Make Movies, the project's fiscal sponsor. In 2013 after two years of working on the project Baumane and team raised another $50,000 on Kickstarter. The film premiered in July 2014 at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic, where it won the International Film Critics (FIPRESCI) Award, as well as a Commendation from the Ecumenical Jury. It was subsequently screened at over 130 other film festivals, including the Animator Film Festival in Poland, the Athens International Film Festival in Greece, the San Sebastian International Film Festival in Spain, and the London International Animation Festival, winning a number of awards. The film opened in New York City on 3 September 2014, and was released in 35 U.S. cities, distributed by Zeitgeist Films. It also was released in Latvia by Locomotive Productions. \\"Rocks In My Pockets\\" is now available for streaming and downloads on a number of platforms, and is also available on DVD. The film attained exceptionally high ratings among U.S. reviewers: a 100% score based on 22 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, as of July 2019. In December 2019, animation web-site Zippy Frames ranked Rocks in My Pockets ninth on their list of the 20 Best Animation Features of the 2010s, stating, \\"Coming before the #metoo movement was ever adopted, it is a surrealistic and poignant tale of empowerment that it is an essential element of this decade.\\"  My Love Affair With Marriage  Signe is currently directing and animating her second animated feature film, My Love Affair with Marriage, which will infuse music and science into a personal love story. The film will examine the biological chemistry of love and gender, as well as societal pressures on an individual to conform to the social mores of the times. After receiving a development grant from NYSCA, through Women Make Movies, the project then raised over $132,000 through Kickstarter to fund production. As of summer 2017, all of the voice actors have been recorded and the film's soundtrack has been completed, and animation has begun, in a partnership with Locomotive Productions, based in Latvia. The voice cast is scheduled to include Dagmara Dominczyk, Matthew Modine, Cameron Monaghan, Stephen Lang, Erica Schroeder, Emma Kenney, and Michele Pawk in key roles.  Style and Themes  Baumane mainly utilizes a personal narration over a flat 2D hand-drawn cel-shaded style of animation. In her feature film, Rocks in My Pockets, she combined papier-m√¢ch√© and stop-motion with traditional animations. Her work tackles difficult subjects such as sex, pregnancy and depression and makes it palatable through irony and humor. Her narrative style uses visual metaphors to communicate how living people feel inside; one example is in her animated short Birth her use of the body as a vessel in her film. Baumane's Teat Beat of Sex, a series of semi fictionalized personal recollections that stem from the artist's firsthand experience and an array of viewpoints on the subject, are uncompromisingly yet refreshingly candid, oftentimes dealing with somewhat taboo areas that can serve as discussion points.

It is part of the municipality 15 Trudering-Riem, and located entirely on the grounds of the 1992 abandoned Munich-Riem airport and includes today, along with a residential area, the Neue Messe M√ºnchen trade fair center and the Riem Arcaden shopping mall.  History  Messestadt Riem is, after Freiham, the second youngest district of Munich. After the flight operation was moved in 1992 to the new Munich Airport, the old airport building in Riem could be emptied and the construction of the new exhibition center started from the mid-1990s, with the corresponding rapid transit connections in the following years. In 1998, the fair could finally move out of their exhibition halls on the Theresienh√∂he to the spacious new building in the fair city. Many other companies also moved and established themselves on the former airport site. Immediately west of the west entrance, the Messesee (Fair lake) was created, 390 m long (north-south) and 46 to 94 m wide (east-west), with a water area of 2.6 hectare. In the southern part of the former airport a development area with rental apartments and condominiums was created. With the Riem Arcaden, shopping for daily items is easily accomplished, and because of the numerous pedestrian zones, many kindergartens and three primary schools the fair site is a suitable location for young families to live. The first projects for car- free living in Munich have been established here since 1998. The first multi- family passive house and the first multifamily zero-energy house in Munich were created here.  Riemer Park  South of the residential area is the Riemer Park. In 2005, the Bundesgartenschau was held here after Munich won the corresponding competition in 2000. For this purpose Riemer Park, a large landscaped park, was built in 2002. After the Bundesgartenschau Riemer Park, the third largest park in the city of Munich, was opened to the public as a recreation area. With enormous effort, a lake was created in its center, known under the name Buga Lake (officially Riemer lake). The lake is east to west 800 m long, 150 m wide, 10 ha in size, up to 18 m deep and contains 100,000 m3 of water. It is an upscale ground water reserve, which can also be used for bathing. Because the water table is too low in the area and also varies greatly seasonally, a concrete trough was applied and the three pumps, each pumping a constant 40 liters of water per second into the lake, stopping the water from accumulating and causing flooding in the basements of surrounding residential buildings, among other things a drain pipe was laid under the sea. On the east bank there is a beach, while on the west bank, where a pedestrian bridge leads over the lake, a sedimentation zone was created with aquatic plants. Located near the west bank is two more, shallow sedimentation basins with water plants that are only 1100 and 800 m2 in size.  Churches  In 2005, in the West of Messestadt Riem, an ecumenical church center where the Protestant St. Sophia and the Catholic St. Florian churches were dedicated and opened.  Transportation  Messestadt Riem is connected to two rapid transport stations of Munich U-Bahn, as well as, the bus lines 139, 186, 189, 190 and N74. The Autobahn 94 passes to the north of the fair city. Discussions are ongoing about a railway connection to Messestadt Riem as part of the Erding Ring Closure to the airport.

He is one of Israel's leading indie musicians, whose English language psychedelic and power pop albums have been hits in Israel and enjoys increasing popularity in a number of European countries. History Music Nobleman started his professional music career in 1995 as a bass player for the successful Israeli rock band Mofa Ha'arnavot Shel Dr. Kasper (Dr. Kasper's Rabbits Show). After the band's breakup in 1996, he moved to London and with bassist, Robert Whitmore, formed his own band, \\"Oracle.\\" As an active member of the mod and garage rock scene in the U.K. his songwriting became influenced by Sixties psychedelic rock. Nobleman took guitar lessons from Thee Headcoats' Bruce Brand and then began crafting tunes at a piano in his house in the western suburbs of London. In 1999, he entered Toe Rag Studios and with producer Liam Watson recorded his first double A side single, 'Sad Song Happy Song / Lonely Boy.' After the English music magazine, Melody Maker, chose the song as \\"Single of the Week,\\" Shy was encouraged to go back to the studio and record a full album of original material. He returned to Tel Aviv and with Israeli rock band, Rockfour, backing him up, he recorded his debut album \\"How to Be Shy.\\" Despite the novelty of English language albums in Israel at the time, the album was selected by several Israeli music critics as \\"Album of the Year\\" and in the USA, Rolling Stone critic, Richie Unterberger, chose it as one of his favourite 10 albums of 2001. The Alternative Press music magazine named him one of \\"25 international artists who can take over America\\". The music's moody lyrics contrasted with happy uplifting melodies. Nobleman's wild and spontaneous live shows, which often featured surprise guest appearances from old time rockers and a number of drag queens, attracted a cult following, and in 2002 Nobleman launched an extensive solo U.S. tour and supported the indie pop band Of Montreal, playing in such venues as New York's famed CBGBs.. In 2001 he played piano on Charlie Megira's debut LP \\"The Abtomatic Miesterzinger Mambo Chic\\", and started to host a local Israeli TV show. In 2005, he recorded his second album \\"Beautiful Life\\", which became a top-10 album in Israel. The musicians on the album included some of Israel's leading indie rock names: Yotam Ben-Horin, Geva Alon and members of Rockfour and The Monotonix. \\"Beautiful Life\\" was more power pop and had a harder sound than Nobleman's debut album. It included the top-10 radio singles \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"Baby In The Rain,\\" and made history as they were the first English songs recorded by an Israeli to play on Israel's state radio station, which until then had refused to play non-Hebrew material recorded by local artists. In 2006, Nobleman played support shows for English band Echo & The Bunnymen, and was invited to Germany by the band \\"Tomte\\", to open their Buchstaben √ºber der Stadt tour. In 2009, Nobleman caused something of a national scandal when he recorded his second Hebrew single \\"We Will Never Reach the World Cup,\\" a song that lamented the consistent failure of Israel national football team. The song became a radio hit but vanished from the airwaves after the Israeli Football Association complained and had it banned. Shy Nobleman's third album, \\"Yomi Hu Chalom\\" (My Day is a Dream), his first one in his native Hebrew language, was released in June 2013 and achieved critical acclaim in Israel. That psychedelic pop sound album also includes two cover songs to other artists translated from English to Hebrew: one for the 1968 hit by Les Irresistibles \\"My Year is a Day\\", and \\"Demons\\", originally by Super Furry Animals. During 2016 Nobleman recorded a new album which was not released yet. Actor & MEDIA Shy Nobleman is also the host of a weekly satirical sports television and internet shows which he has been on the air since 2006. Since the year 2016 he has been working as a TV sports commentator on SPORT5 TV channel in Israel. For the past 20 years, Nobleman has also been the Israeli voice of Disney's Donald Duck. For several years Nobleman was working as a music critic and had a weekly column in various Israeli papers. Personal life Nobleman is a far family relative of French musician and singer, Sacha Distel. Nobleman is married to Israeli singer and songwriter, Billy Levy, from the band Billy and the Firm.

As a seventh-grade quarterback in 2010, he garnered national attention when he verbally committed to play football at the University of Southern California. In 2014, Sills decommitted from USC and eventually signed a national letter of intent to play at West Virginia University. Sills began his college career as a quarterback, but moved to wide receiver as a freshman. After spending his freshman year playing for the West Virginia Mountaineers, Sills transferred to El Camino College, but transferred back to West Virginia in 2017. He led the nation that season in touchdown receptions and was a first team 2017 College Football All- America Team selection by Sporting News, Sports Illustrated and CBS Sports for the 2017 West Virginia Mountaineers. He led the 2018 Big 12 Conference in touchdowns and was named 2018 All-Big 12 Conference football team first team selection as well as a Second-team 2018 College Football All-American by the Walter Camp Football Foundation and American Football Coaches Association. Early life Sills was born in 1996. His parents are Denise and David Sills IV. He has two older sisters, Emma and Abby. His father is a commercial developer and contractor, who played cornerback for the Virginia Military Institute. He began playing youth football at age six and began training at age nine with quarterback trainer Steve Clarkson. Lane Kiffin offered Sills a scholarship to play college football at USC in 2010. Sills gave USC a non- binding verbal commitment in 2010. Sills was among the youngest football players to receive a scholarship offer from a major football program. High school career As a high school freshman, Sills was the starting quarterback for Red Lion Christian Academy, a private Delaware school for grades K-12. Sports Illustrated hailed him as one of the greatest prospects ever, and Bloomberg News described him as the \\"best arm money can buy\\". At Red Lion in 2010, he accumulated 1,355 passing yards and nine touchdowns against five interceptions in eight games. In 2011, he totalled 2,340 yards and 28 touchdowns in what was his second year as a varsity quarterback. He was named a MaxPreps.com U.S. Air Force second-team freshman All-American. As a sophomore, Sills became the quarterback for Eastern Christian Academy (ECA) of Elkton, Maryland. The move was controversial because the school was a newly- formed online school. All enrolled boys were on the 46-man football team established by David Sills IV to showcase their talents to college scouts. Eastern Christian Academy was only able to play in three games in 2012 due to the school's failure to gain accreditation from the state. As a junior, Sills injured his knuckle and his delivery was impacted forever. He lost his perfect delivery technique. Lane Kiffin, who had originally offered Sills a scholarship back in 2010, was fired by USC in 2013. He was replaced by Ed Orgeron on an interim basis. Eventually, USC would hire Steve Sarkisian to become the new head coach. According to Sills' father, Sarkisian told his son that USC would honor their scholarship offer. While receiving reassurance from Sarkisian, the Sills got the feeling that David wasn't USC's first option. USC had offered and eventually signed two highly ranked quarterbacks in the same class, Sam Darnold and Ricky Town. Sills decommitted from USC in June 2014. College career West Virginia On July 16, 2014, Sills announced his commitment to West Virginia University via Twitter. Sills was one of West Virginia's early enrollees from the 2015 recruiting class. As a result, he was able to participate in spring practice. He battled fellow quarterbacks Skyler Howard, William Crest Jr. and Chris Chugunov for the starting quarterback spot. Howard was eventually named the starting quarterback. Sills earned playing time as a wide receiver after impressing coaches with his performance on the scout team. On October 17, 2015, Sills made his collegiate debut against the Baylor Bears. He finished the game with two receptions for 64 yards. His second collegiate reception was a 35-yard touchdown. He made the game-winning touchdown reception in the 2016 Cactus Bowl against Arizona State and ended the season with seven receptions for 131 yards. During spring drills in 2016, Sills split time between quarterback and wide receiver. After West Virginia's 2016 spring game, West Virginia head coach Dana Holgorsen stated that Howard solidified his position as the starting quarterback and that Crest and Chugunov would continue to battle for the backup quarterback spot. With several quarterbacks ahead of him on the depth chart and former Florida starting quarterback Will Grier scheduled to become eligible to play for the Mountaineers in 2017, it appeared unlikely Sills would ever get an opportunity to play quarterback at West Virginia. El Camino College On June 23, 2016, Sills announced he would transfer to El Camino College. He spent seven months on the couch of high school friend Khaliel Rodgers who was on the USC roster as an offensive lineman at the time. In his lone season playing for the Warriors, Sills played quarterback and threw for 1,636 yards and 15 touchdowns. Return to West Virginia On December 15, 2016, West Virginia football announced on Twitter that Sills would be returning to West Virginia. In West Virginia's 2017 spring game, Sills lined up at wide receiver and caught six passes for 98 yards from Will Grier. In the September 3 season opener for the 2017 West Virginia Mountaineers against the 21st-ranked Virginia Tech Hokies Sills posted nine receptions for 94 yards and two touchdowns in a losing effort against the Hokies. On September 9, Sills posted seven catches for a career-high 153 yards and a career-high three touchdowns against East Carolina. He then tallied 130 yards and two touchdowns against Kansas on September 23. Following the Kansas game and a bye week Sills was tied for the national lead in touchdown receptions with seven in his first four games and then he added two touchdown receptions on October 7 against TCU, bringing his total to nine. Sills added three more touchdown receptions on October 14 against Texas Tech extending his national lead. Sills' three receiving touchdowns on October 21 in a 38-36 victory over Baylor gave sills a total of 15 for the season, which continued to lead the nation. Sills made his 17th and 18th touchdown catches of the season on November 11 against Kansas State. However, in the following game, starting quarterback Grier was lost for the season, and Sills finished the season with 18 touchdowns. As a junior, Sills received numerous honors. On November 13, he was one of three 2017 Big 12 Conference football wide receivers named as a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award (along with James Washington and Keke Coutee). A week later he was named as one of three finalists for the award (along with Washington and Michael Gallup). On November 30, Sills was the only member of the 2017 West Virginia Mountaineers football team named to the 2017 All-Big 12 Conference football first team. Sills finished the season as the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision touchdown receptions leader with 18 (tied with Anthony Miller). Sills earned 2017 College Football All-America Team first team recognition from Sports Illustrated, Sporting News and CBS Sports. Sills also earned several second-team All-American honors, including Associated Press, Walter Camp Football Foundation, SB Nation, College Football News, and American Football Coaches Association. Sills decided to return to play his senior season with Grier. Sills entered the season on watchlists for the Maxwell Award, Fred Biletnikoff Award, and Walter Camp Award. With Grier back for their senior seasons, Sills opened up the season with a seven-catch, 140-yard, two-touchdown effort in a victory over Tennessee. The Mountaineers schedule was cut short one game when Hurricane Florence caused a cancellation of the September 15 game at NC State. On September 22, Sills tallied three touchdowns against Kansas State. Sills also had 2-touchdown performances against Baylor (139 yards) on October 25, Texas on November 3, and Oklahoma (131 yards) on November 23. Sills' 15 touchdowns led the Big 12. Following the season, he was a 2018 All-Big 12 Conference football team first team selection. Sills earned 2018 College Football All-America Team second team recognition by the Walter Camp Football Foundation and , American Football Coaches Association. He earned third team recognition from the Associated Press. Professional career  Buffalo Bills  Sills signed with the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent on April 27, 2019. He was waived by the Bills on August 31, 2019.  New York Giants  On September 1, 2019, Sills was signed to the New York Giants practice squad. On December 17, 2019, Sills was promoted to the active roster. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the Giants on July 28, 2020, and activated from the list seven days later. On September 4, 2020, Sills was placed on the injured reserve list after fracturing his foot during training camp.

While not lacking intelligence, Carlos IV is broadly seen as an idler compared to his father; ultimately he was outmaneuvered by Napoleon at a time when he was more interested in sport and hunting than affairs of state. Titian's Portrait of Charles V with a dog, 1533 While Goya devotes a great deal of attention to his depiction of the king's sash and cloth, he emphasises his weakness in his rendering of a near-portly belly and indecisive stare. The art critic Robert Hughes describes a \\"big nosed face, framed in the tricorned hat like the head of an affable turtle poking from its shell\\".Hughes, 146 During his career, Goya depicted both father and son in hunting dress. The inspiration for the older man's outfit is probably taken from Vel√°zquez's portrait of Philip IV, which the artist would have opportunity to see as then court painter. Goya pays tribute to Titian's Portrait of Charles V with a dog by depicting a dog loyally sniffing at the royal crotch.Hughes, 147 Goya had painted Carlos IV's father in 1780, when the artist himself was a young man. Although few of his thoughts survive for art historians, it is generally believed that the sentiment of later works such as Charles IV of Spain and His Family lend credence to the theory that he held his weakling King in little regard. Charles IV is rendered as portly and sightly confused, seemingly more suited to the role of country gentleman than regal, absolute head. Notes Sources * Boime. Albert.

Naming B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o literally means Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu in which Wu (Âê≥, Ng√¥) was the ancestors's land (now Fengyang County, Anhui) of Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. In 1356, Zhu Yuanzhang himself took the title Duke of Wu (Âê≥ÂúãÂÖ¨) and later King of Wu (Âê≥Áéã, in Vietnamese: Ng√¥ V∆∞∆°ng). Therefore, one could reason that Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i named his work Pacification of the Wu instead of Pacification of the Ming in order to subtly emphasize the victory of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and the failure of the Ming Dynasty which was called by its origin's name Wu in the proclamation. The second part of the name, ƒë·∫°i c√°o (Â§ßË™•) is commonly understood as the denotement of its literary genre, a great edict (c√°o), or the announcement's great scale (ƒë·∫°i c√°o). The former was the name of a chapter in the book Classic of History in which great edict was a special form of an edict. But during the time of the early Ming Dynasty, great edict was used by Hongwu Emperor for his official documents of imperial laws and thus became a symbol of power and authority of the Ming emperor. For this reason, there was an opinion that Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i named his announcement ƒë·∫°i c√°o for the purpose of reversing the meaning of great edict from the symbol of Ming emperor to the representation of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát victory over his very own army. Background In 1427, L√™ L·ª£i led the Lam S∆°n uprising to the ultimate victory over the Ming Dynasty which put an end to the Fourth Chinese domination in Vietnam. As a result, in 1428 L√™ L·ª£i ordered Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i to write an announcement for people in the country about the total pacification of the Ming Dynasty and the affirmation of the independence of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. From that demand, Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i wrote B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o which not only proclaimed the independence of the country but also claimed the equality of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát with China during the long history and expressed many own ideas of Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i about the fairness, the role of people in history of the country and the way to win a war of independence. Besides, Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i used B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o to prove the just cause of the Lam S∆°n uprising and why L√™ L·ª£i's army could drive out the Ming Dynasty with its policies of relying on people to fight against the invaders. After it was announced, the proclamation was considered a success, while Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i became one of the most crucial figures of the royal court after the coronation of L√™ L·ª£i, now L√™ Th√°i T·ªï. However Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i was finally executed in 1442 during the political struggle in the royal court and royal family of the early L√™ Dynasty. The earliest version of B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o that remains today was found in the 1697 edition of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ which was compiled by Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n. Content B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o is an edict- like () announcement written in the literary form of parallel constructions (vƒÉn bi·ªÅn ng·∫´u). The proclamation was divided in four parts: * The first part demonstrated the history of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát with its identity and tradition of fighting against Chinese dynasties for the purpose of independence and equal position as China. * The second part denounced the conspiracy and truculent crime of the Ming Dynasty during their domination in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát when they enslaved the people and deprived resources of the country. * The third part narrated the Lam S∆°n uprising from the hard beginning to the final victories. * The fourth part summarized the lesson from history and reaffirmed that righteousness would win. Originally, B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o was written in H√°n t·ª±, it was translated into Vietnamese by several scholars such as Ng√¥ T·∫•t T·ªë, B√πi K·ª∑ or Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim, the translated version by Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim in his Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c and the revised version by B√πi K·ª∑ are considered the more popular and included in the schoolbook in Vietnam. Significance B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o is considered the second declaration of independence of Vietnam after the poem Nam qu·ªëc s∆°n h√† which was written by L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát in the early L√Ω Dynasty. The proclamation is highly appreciated not only for its value of propaganda and history but also for its fine literary quality which is praised as the \\"Incomparably powerful writing document\\" (Thi√™n c·ªï h√πng vƒÉn) in the History of Vietnam. With B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o, Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i asserted the obvious independence and equal status of Vietnam with China and more importantly, reckoned that independence could be achieved only when the rulers had concern for their people and made decision for the interest of the masses. Today, B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o is taught in both secondary (grades 6‚Äì9) and high school (grades 10‚Äì12) in Vietnam.

UrbanSim: A Simulation System for Land Use and Transportation. Networks and Spatial Economics 3 (43-67). The software architecture was modularized and reimplemented in Python beginning in 2005, making extensive use of the Numpy numerical library. The software has been generalized and abstracted from the UrbanSim model system, and is now referred to as the Open Platform for Urban Simulation (OPUS), in order to facilitate a plug-in architecture for models such as activity-based travel, dynamic traffic assignment, emissions, and land cover change.Paul Waddell, Hana ≈†evc√≠kov√°, David Socha, Eric Miller, Kai Nagel, Opus: An Open Platform for Urban Simulation. Presented at the Computers in Urban Planning and Urban Management Conference, June, 2005, London, U.K. OPUS includes a Graphical User Interface, and a concise expression language to facilitate access to complex internal operations by non-programmers.Borning, Alan, Hana ≈†evƒç√≠kov√°, and Paul Waddell (2008) A Domain-Specific Language for Urban Simulation Variables, Proceedings of the 9th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research, Montr√©al, Canada, May 2008. Beginning in 2012, UrbanSim was re- implemented using current Scientific Python libraries such as Pandas. UrbanSim Inc. has developed the UrbanSim Cloud Platform that deploys simulations on the cloud for scalability, enabling hundreds or even thousands of simulations to be run simultaneously, and a web browser based User Interface that features a 3D web map view of inputs and outputs from the simulation. UrbanSim models have been pre-built for 400 metropolitan areas within the United States at a census block level of detail. Users anywhere in the world can also build UrbanSim models using zone and parcel templates, by uploading local data and using the cloud resources to auto-specify and calibrate the models using local data. Details are available at www.urbansim.com. Design Earlier urban model systems were generally based on deterministic solution algorithms such as Spatial Interaction or Spatial Input-Output, that emphasize repeatability and uniqueness of convergence to an equilibrium, but rest on strong assumptions about behavior, such as agents having perfect information of all the alternative locations in the metropolitan area, transactions being costless, and markets being perfectly competitive. Housing booms and busts, and the financial crisis, are relatively clear examples of market imperfections that motivate the use of less restrictive assumptions in UrbanSim. Rather than calibrating the model to a cross-sectional equilibrium, or base-year set of conditions, statistical methods have been developed to calibrate uncertainty in UrbanSim arising from its use of Monte Carlo methods and from uncertainty in data and models, against observed data over a longitudinal period, using a method known as Bayesian Melding.Sevcikova, H., A. Raftery and P. Waddell (2007) Assessing Uncertainty in Urban Simulations Using Bayesian Melding. Transportation Research Part B: Methodology Vol. 41, No. 6 (652-659). In addition to its less strong assumptions about markets, UrbanSim departs from earlier model designs that used high levels of aggregation of geography into large zones, and agents such as households and jobs into large groups assumed to be homogeneous. Instead, UrbanSim adopts a microsimulation approach meaning that it represents individual agents within the simulation. This is an agent-level model system, but unlike most agent- based models, it does not focus exclusively on the interactions of adjacent agents. Households, businesses or jobs, buildings, and land areas represented alternatively by parcels, gridcells, or zones, are used to represent the agents and locations within a metropolitan area. The parcel level modeling applications allow for the first time the representation of accessibility at a walking scale, something that cannot be effectively done at high levels of spatial aggregation.Lee, Brian, Paul Waddell, Liming Wang and Ram Pendyala (2010) Re-examining the Influence of Work and Non-work Accessibility on Residential Location Choices with a Micro-analytic Framework. Environment and Planning A Vol. 42 (913-930) Engagement One of the motivations for the UrbanSim project is to not only provide robust predictions of the potential outcomes of different transportation investments and land use policies, but also to facilitate more deliberative civic engagement in what are often contentious debates about transportation infrastructure, or land policies, with uneven distributions of benefits and costs. Initial work on this topic has adopted an approach called Value Sensitive Design.Davis, J., P. Lin, A. Borning, B. Friedman, P. Kahn and P. Waddell.

The film tells in flash back, the story of a gay member of ETA who died under mysterious circumstances. Plot The film opens at Mikel's funeral mass. A flashback spins out the circumstances of his life and death. Mikel, a young pharmacist involved in Basque Nationalist politics, is living in Lekeitio, a Basque coastal town. When his wife, Bego√±a, returns from a long trip abroad, he picks her up at the airport. Their marriage is unhappy; the relationship between the couple is tense. Bego√±a wants to resolve their problems, but Mikel is indifferent. In the encounter after Bego√±a's return, the couple visits Mikel's domineering mother, Do√±a Maria Luisa, a widow who lives in the same small town. The relationship between mother and son is also fractured. Mikel and Bego√±a have an argument when she tells him that she has discussed their sexual problems with his mother. They go out to have supper to the home of a pair of friends: Mart√≠n, a doctor who has arrived at the town fleeing the Chilean dictatorship, and Martin's wife, Arantza. The calm of town is disrupted with the senseless death of two young people, who failed to stop in a nocturnal control and were killed by the Civil Guard. Mikel attends a political meeting where he is offered a seat in the next local election for the Basque independent party to which he belongs. Mikel takes parts in local festivities. At dawn, he arrives drunk at home. Having sex with his wife, Mikel bites Bego√±a's clitoris during an alcohol-fuelled attempt at oral sex. This incident effectively marks the end of their marriage. The next day Mart√≠n, takes cares of Bego√±a's wounds inflected in the attack and as a friend and mentor to Mikel, he recommends him a therapist in Bilbao. After his first session, Mikel joins an old friend in a bar and gets drunk. Mikel wakes up the following morning, knowing that he has had sex with Fama, a female impersonator, whose show he has seen at the bar. Realizing what he has done, humiliated and confused, Mikel embarks on a suicidal drive down the wrong side of the motorway, but swerves aside in time to avoid a crash. Bego√±a moves out and a new chapter begins in Mikel's life. Uninvited, Fama comes to the town and gives Mikel a surprise visit in the pharmacy where he works. She offers him emotional support and recounting the story of her life, she encourages him to come to term with his sexuality. Mikel has a meeting with Bego√±a and is forgiven by her. He tells her that never before he has seen the future with promise like now. However, when his homosexual relationship becomes public, his political comrades reject him. Mikel's proud mother is horrified with her son homosexual relationship. Mikel is arrested and questioned about ETA activities. His friend, Martin, has confessed that years ago both helped a wounded ETA member to escape to France. Resisting with dignity the violent attempts of the police to get information out of him, Mikel comes out of prison enthusiastic about developing his relationship with Fama. The next morning his brother finds him dead in bed in his mother's home. His death is not explained, but cinematography points clearly to the mother, who has already stated that she will not accept the public humiliation of Mikel's homosexual relationship. Mikel's political comrades who rejected him in life appropriate his death as a forum for political protest.

It stars Cody Estes as a shy 10-year-old boy forced into a sleepover with a school bully, played by Rhett Damon. Jennette McCurdy plays Lucy, the bully's older sister. Plot Anthony (no surname given) is forced into a sleepover by his mother in order to help him make friends. The trouble is, the \\"friend\\" his mother makes him spend the night with is a bully named Craig Randall. As he enters the house, his mother turns her car radio on, and hears a news report about a rash of kidnappings of children who were found alive tied up in duct tape. For the most part, Craig is persistently hostile towards Anthony. His mother spends time preparing unappetizing meals that are supposed to be healthy, such as homemade tofu squares, fish heads, and spring garden loaf. On some occasions it seems that Craig is ready to become more friendly towards him when they find a shared interest in toys, video games, slime, etcetera, but then resumes his hostility. Anthony's older brother John, is a burnout who spends time with his idiotic girlfriend Jill, and his friends who are plotting to steal a parking meter and break into it for the money, presumably for drugs. Background music during his scenes consist of classic rock from Steely Dan, Jethro Tull, Blue √ñyster Cult and The Grateful Dead. When Anthony tries to call him to come and pick him up, he refuses believing that his little brother should learn to be more sociable. At dinner the rest of the family eats foods that Anthony finds unappealing. Craig's mother boasts of Lucy's upcoming role in a school production of Chicago, despite the fact that she's in the middle of a conversation. When Craig and Lucy's father notices that Anthony doesn't like fish heads, he suggests ordering a pizza, which shocks every other family member. Before preparing for bed, Anthony walks in on Craig's sister, who he finds is using his toothbrush to brush her teeth. She compares it to kissing, then explains that she's fond of him because he upsets her brother as well as the rest of the family dynamic, sneaks a kiss on his lips and then runs to bed. Craig accuses Anthony of \\"trying to sex his sister,\\" and threatens to either tell his parents or kill him in his sleep. Desperate to escape, he calls home again, but both his mother and his brother insist that he should stay the night. His mother suggests that the only way he can come home is if he asks Craig's parents to give him the ride, but when he tries to do so, he sees them on the verge of intimacy with each other. Much to his surprise, his big brother has come to the rescue. John is convinced that by doing this he missed an opportunity for a sexual tryst with his girlfriend, but when Anthony informs him about the kiss he got from Lucy, he thinks he might have a chance with his girlfriend after all. Before they return home, he leaves a note on the Randall's kitchen window, which Mrs. Randall misinterprets as another kidnapping by the Duct Tape Gang. Police and news reporters surround the house, while Anthony sleeps safely at home on the couch.

He was the first person to captain Titanic, overseeing the ship at Belfast while her delivery-trip crew was assembling there from 25 to 31 March 1912. A 1911 story in The New York Times described Haddock as the \\"only skipper in the Atlantic trade who wears the mid-Victorian mutton chop whiskers without a beard or mustache\\".  Early life  Haddock was born to Herbert James Haddock (born 1825) in Rugby, Warwickshire on 27 January 1861. He joined the Royal Navy, serving as a lieutenant aboard HMS Edinburgh. In 1902, Haddock was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was later aide de camp to British royalty. White Star Line After his Royal naval service, Haddock joined the White Star Line, where he captained a number of liners including the RMS Britannic, SS Germanic, RMS Cedric, and RMS Oceanic. Haddock was also nominally the first commander of RMS Titanic. He signed on as her master at Southampton on 25 March 1912, and then travelled to Belfast to oversee the crew that was assembling there for the ship's delivery trip to Southampton. He was relieved by Edward J. Smith at Belfast on 31 March and then returned to Southampton to take command of Smith's previous ship, RMS Olympic. On 3 April he began Olympics tenth Southampton-New York-Southampton roundtrip, arriving in New York on 10 April, the day Titanic left Southampton. Olympic was given the radio call sign MKC. At the time of Titanics sinking Haddock was sailing Olympic easterly from New York to Southampton, approximately west by south of Titanics location. Haddock was informed of the disaster by wireless operator Ernest James Moore at 2250 ET on 14 April. After receiving a CQD call from Titanic, Haddock calculated a new course and headed directly to her. He also sent for an engineer to set the ship's engines to full power. When from Titanic, at approximately 1600 ET on 15 April, Haddock received a message from Captain Rostron of RMS Carpathia, explaining that continuing on course to Titanic would gain nothing, as \\"All boats accounted for. About 675 souls saved [...] Titanic foundered about 2.20 am.\\" Rostron requested that the message be forwarded to White Star and Cunard. He said that he was returning to harbour in New York, and recommended that other ships do the same. Subsequently, the wireless room aboard the Olympic operated as a clearing room for radio messages. In the United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic, Haddock was interviewed by William Alden Smith on 25 May 1912. Haddock gave his residence as Southampton, and his employment as a \\"Master Mariner\\". Seven weeks after the Titanic disaster, Haddock almost ran the Olympic aground on rocks near Land's End. The error was attributed to faulty navigation, and Haddock was under strict observation for his next few voyages. WWI With the start of the First World War, in October 1914, Haddock was in command of Olympic during her attempt to assist HMS Audacious after she had collided with a German mine off the western coast of Scotland. Olympic was subsequently laid up until being converted to a troopship at the outbreak of World War I. Haddock was redeployed to command a dummy fleet of wooden dreadnoughts and battle cruisers, and was stationed in Belfast. In 1915, Harold Sanderson, head of International Mercantile Marine, tried to reassign Haddock to captain Britannic when she was converted to a hospital ship. However, the Admiralty refused to release Haddock from his assignment in Belfast. From 5 to 14 May 1917, Haddock sailed from Liverpool to New York City aboard the SS Saint Paul, six months before she was taken over for wartime service. The voyage's manifest shows that Haddock's trip was funded by the Admiralty, and states that his final destination was Newport News, Virginia, where he would be received by the British Navy. According to the 1917 ship's manifest, Haddock had not been back to the United States since 1914. It is not thought that Haddock returned to the White Star Line after the war. Personal life Haddock married Mabel Eliza Bouchette, in Rock Ferry, Merseyside on 13 May 1893. Bouchette was born in Liverpool in and lived with her father, Francis, at 91 Townsend Lane, West Derby, Liverpool. Other sources state that Bouchette was from Quebec. Haddock and Bouchette had four children - Geoffrey (10 January 1895 - 17 September 1916), Ruth (1896 - 26 October 1958), and twins Herbert (21 October 1903 - 1988) and Joan (21 October 1903 - 21 November 1920). Geoffrey was a Lieutenant in the Victoria Rifles of Canada. He was killed in action on 27 September 1917 at the age of 21, and was buried at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In the 28 May 1935 edition of the London Gazette, Ruth was described as a spinster. UK censuses and civil registers show that the family lived in Rock Ferry until at least 1904. They later moved to Southampton, living in the suburb of Bitterne. Bouchette died on 11 March 1935. Death Haddock died in Southampton on 4 October 1946 at the age of 85.

During the decade from 1965 to 1975, Armstrong Studios in South Melbourne was arguably the top independent recording studio in Australasia. History The founder Founder Bill Armstrong was born in Melbourne in 1929. After studying electrical engineering at Caulfield Technical College he started his career as an engineer at radio station 3UZ from 1954‚Äì56, where his work included disc cutting of radio shows and live-to- air orchestral music broadcasts. From 1956-60 he was the manager of a recently founded independent label, W&G; Records, whose A&R; manager Ron Tudor discovered and signed The Seekers. Armstrong established the W&G; disc-cutting room and in 1957 built their recording studio in West Melbourne. That year he also supervised the sound system for Phillips Bell at the Main Stadium at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. From 1960-61 Armstrong was the manager of the Custom Recording Department at 3DB in Melbourne, where he recorded radio commercials and soundtracks for television advertisements. From 1961-65 he was manager of Telefil Sound Recording and Film Studios, which was at the time the largest commercial recording studio in Melbourne. Housed in a converted Melbourne cinema, it was equipped with one, two and three track Ampex recorders, and its clients included the local divisions of the EMI, CBS and RCA labels. Opening a studio In 1965, Armstrong opened his own studio in a small terrace house in Albert Rd, South Melbourne. One of the first pop recordings made there was the backing track for The Easybeats' 1965 breakthrough hit \\"She's So Fine\\", which was overseen by British-born engineer Roger Savage, who had recently arrived from the UK as an assisted migrant. Reflecting on Savage's subsequent importance to the Australian music industry in a 2013 ABC radio interview, Bill Armstrong quipped that Savage's assisted passage to Australia represented \\"probably the best ¬£20 the Australian government ever spent\\".Bill Armstrong, interview with Jordie Kilby, Rare Collections, ABC Radio National, first broadcast 25 August 2013 Over the next few years it expanded into six adjoining properties, including four studios equipped with 4-track machines. In 1968 Armstrong installed one of the first 8-track recorders in Australia, followed by 16 and then 24-track machines, together with state-of-the-art mixing desks in the early '70s. During this time, many of Australia's most distinguished producers and engineers worked there. The original engineering team were Roger Savage, Allan Pay and Philip. In 1968 John L Sayers joined the team and later Alan Pay resigned. Then Graham Owens and Ernie Rose joined as engineers. The EMI producers David Mackay, Franciscus Henri, Howard Gable, Peter Dawkins and Ted Albert, all worked at Armstrong's. Other producers included Ron Tudor of Fable Records, Johnny Young of Lewis Young Productions, Pat Aulton, G. Wayne Thomas and Ian Meldrum. Armstrong's studios soon overtook two other major studios in Australia at the time - the EMI and Festival Records facilities in Sydney - to become the most sought-after recording venue in the country, and the \\"engine room\\" of Australian pop and rock recording. Many of the most popular and successful Australian recordings from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s were made there, including hit albums and singles by The Masters Apprentices, The Twilights, The Groove, The Groop, Zoot, The Aztecs, Russell Morris, Brian Cadd, Daddy Cool, Franciscus Henri, Hans Poulsen, Spectrum, John Farnham, Skyhooks, Little River Band, The Sports, Models and many others. Many famous overseas artists also recorded there while visiting Australia, including Earl Hines, Cleo Laine and John Dankworth, and Stephane Grapelli.Bill Armstrong, interview with Jordie Kilby, Rare Collections, ABC Radio National, first broadcast 25 August 2013 Armstrong's also quickly became the leading studio for recording national advertising commercials, and a team of music jingle writers occupied offices in the facility, including John and Anne Hawker, Peter Best, Bruce Smeaton, Bruce Woodley, Peter Jones and John Farrar. According to Armstrong, industry professionals such as EMI house producer David Mackay and Festival house producer Pat Aulton greatly preferred to use the Armstrong facilities over their company's own studios in Sydney, and regularly travelled to Melbourne to record there. Interviewed in 2013, Armstrong also recalled that young Melbourne singer Johnny Farnham was often hired to record vocals for the many commercial jingles recorded at Armstrong's, and it was there that he was discovered by producer David Mackay, who subsequently signed the singer to a recording contract with EMI, and produced his breakthrough hit single \\"Sadie The Cleaning Lady\\".Bill Armstrong, interview with Jordie Kilby, Rare Collections, ABC Radio National, first broadcast 25 August 2013 Farnham returned the favour many years later when he returned to Armstrong's to record his hugely successful 'comeback' album Whispering Jack. Expansion In 1972 the company bought a former butter factory in Bank St, South Melbourne, and converted it into a five-studio complex, making Armstrong the largest commercial studio in the southern hemisphere. At this time Armstrong was responsible for 80% of the locally recorded hit records for major labels including EMI, RCA, Mushroom and Fable. In 1974 the studios were sold to the Age Newspaper Group and the name of the company was changed to Armstrong Audio Video (AAV). The studio's success continued into the 1980s. Young engineer Doug Brady joined the staff and started his career at AAV by recording and mixing Australia's highest selling record of all time: John Farnham's Whispering Jack, going on to win ARIA Engineer of the Year three times. James \\"JIMBO\\" Barton was also added to the roster. He went on to work with Julian Menndelson & Trevor Horn, multi-platinum Queensr√øche and won a Grammy Award for Best Live Recording for Eric Clapton's \\"Unplugged\\". Other renowned acts who recorded at AAV in this period include U2, Paul McCartney, Madonna, Bob Dylan, Split Enz, Crowded House and Australian Crawl. Recent years In the 1990s the audio operations of AAV were acquired by a staff consortium headed by producer-engineer Ern Rose and the company's name was changed to Metropolis Audio. A controlling share was later acquired by another audio- visual company, Celtex, but this company eventually got into financial difficulties and Metropolis was abruptly closed down by the building's owners in 2006. In the meantime Edensound Mastering had taken residence in the famed 180 Bank Street building and directors Martin Pullan and David Drew took the opportunity to take over the lease and return the studio to its original Armstrong name. Doug Brady returned as a partner in the business having recorded numerous giant albums and recording projects as a freelance including the music for the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.

(ADSCO) is an educational institution offering kindergarten to college courses in Bayugan, Agusan del Sur, Philippines. It was founded in 1966 by couple, Dr. Inocencio P. Angeles and Clarita J. Angeles. ADSCO is the only institution in Bayugan city to offer pre-school, elementary, high school and college. It serves as the major college institution in Agusan del Sur and is the biggest school in the province. History In the early part of the 1950s when Manila was recovering from the damage caused by World War II, many were attracted to the ‚ÄúLand of Promise‚Äù, Mindanao, and the future it offers. A young dentist, Dr. Inocencio Palacio Angeles of Morong, Rizal who was working for the malaria control unit of the Department of Health was assigned to the province of Agusan. He was based in Butuan City. A young woman, Clarita Turla Joson, put up a ‚Äúbotica,‚Äù being a pharmacist, and settled in the river town of Esperanza, which was frequented by the members of the malaria control unit. And so started a romance that led into marriage. Their first born (Ma. Theresa) died of leukemia when she was five years old. The Angeles were residing in the newly established sitio of Bayugan. The parents of Dr. Angeles came from Morong, Rizal to give the couple moral and spiritual upliftment. And what a fruitful visit it turned out to be. It was Justo Angeles advised the couple that, being pioneers of this place, it is their moral obligation to contribute if not spearhead the development of the municipality and its people. They realized they should leave a good legacy to the people of Agusan. Using the money they received from the insurance company for the death of Ma. Theresa, they heeded the advice of the old man to put up a school. In 1966, the Southern Agusan Institute (SAI) was born. The first principal was Justo Angeles. They offered high school education in a two-storey building with six classrooms. Thus, was SAI‚Äôs humble beginning. In 1968, collegiate and vocational courses were given government recognition through the Department of Education. The school name was replaced by Southern Agusan College. From six rooms, the main building then had 14 rooms. There was a one-story building with 12 rooms that houses the ever-growing population of students especially in the college department. In 1975, the name of the school was changed to Agusan del Sur College (ADSCO). ADSCO today stands out among the educational institutions in Agusan del Sur. There are now additional buildings including a two-storey and a four-storey building with a multi- purpose rooftop. ADSCO built a new gymnasium to cater the activities of the students even during rainy days. By the end of March 2010, a condo/hotel type building will be constructed. This will serve as the laboratory of its Housekeeping course with TESDA and the newly applied course with CHED, the Hotel and Restaurant Management. A new conference room which can accommodate 150 guests would have been finished by then, too. The people of Agusan are grateful for the love, sacrifices and pioneering spirit of this couple. They have left a legacy. Clarita J. Angeles died on December 11, 1981. Her death was a great loss to ADSCO. She was a woman of vision and dedication. Her motherly touch and devotion lent moral support and strength at the time when ADSCO was in its early stages of development. Under the able leadership of Dr. Inocencio P. Angeles and only son Inocencio ‚ÄúBobet‚Äù J. Angeles Jr., ADSCO will continue to grow and be of greater service to the youth and community.

The sole species it contains, Quincula lobata, is commonly known as Chinese lantern, lobed groundcherry, or purple groundcherry. This plant is also classified as Physalis lobata in genus Physalis.Calflora: Physalis lobata accessed 5.16.2016. It is native to the southwestern United States as far east as Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as northern Mexico, where it grows in many types of open, dry habitat, including disturbed areas. It is a perennial herb producing ridged, spreading stems up to half a meter long. The lance-shaped leaves are up to 7 centimeters long, smooth or lobed on the edges. The flowers blooming from the leaf axils are up to 2 centimeters wide, widely bell-shaped or flat-faced with five vague, pointed lobes, not drooping like those of many Physalis species. They are purple in color, sometimes with white deep in the throats. The bell-shaped calyx of sepals at the base of the flower enlarges as the fruit develops, becoming an inflated, lanternlike structure up to 2 centimeters long which contains the berry. Phylogenetic studies suggest that Quincula is closely related to the small North American genus Chamaesaracha.

It takes place in New York City. It received two Awards of Merits and an Honorable Mention at film festivals.  Plot  Melissa Navia as Medina Medina (Melissa Navia) gets up after hearing a voice in her dreams. She prepares to go out, has a coffee, and does a quick breath relaxation exercise. Her friend, Sidonia (Bonnie Piesse), arrives and finds Medina, who is looking at herself in the mirror with a sad expression. Sidonia tries to lighten the moment, and reminds Medina that her friends and family are waiting for her. Medina gets herself together and they head off to the funeral service for Medina's fianc√©. Medina is with her friend Tesla (Romy Valentina), who tells her she is love with Medina's brother, Enzo (Francesco Plazza), and is thinking of getting engaged. Medina is a bit surprised, but congratulates her. They try to visit an art exhibit, but the female security guard kicks them out, as she remembers the duo's wild reputation. Medine is upset, but Tesla invites her and Enzo for drinks. Tesla and Enzo cheer Medina up with their light conversation. Quinn (James Gill) looks depressed as he meets up with his friend Fera (Terilyn Marshelle- Fleming) at the street. He tells her that Nilda left him and took everything, including his possessions. He shows her the \\"Dear John letter\\" composed on bath tissue. Fera's husband, Camden (Jorell Stills Haigler), arrives and they explain the situation. Fera and Camden console Quinn but he leaves to clear his mind. They follow Quinn to make sure he does not do something regretful. Tesla reminds Medina of an upcoming martial arts promotion test. Medina prepares by doing some stretching, practicing footwork, and twirling weapons including swords, staffs and spears. Meanwhile, Fera is increasingly concerned about Quinn. Camden notes that Fera and Quinn act like siblings, but for now, all they can do is continue to look after Quinn. They head to a show at the Lincoln Center. For the promotion exam, Medina must knock Master down once before she is knocked down three times. In the first round, Medina goes down quickly after losing her balance from a kick to her thigh. In the second round, she falls from a palm strike to her chest. As she gasps for air, Tesla and Enzo show concern. Medina quickly plans a better offense, and wins the next round. Master promotes her and gives her some words of wisdom. Some weeks later, Enzo and Tesla catch up to Medina and tell her they are now engaged. They are worried about Medina's isolation but Medina ensures them she is dealing with things. Enzo reminds Medina about the upcoming meeting at Fran√ßoise's restaurant. Camden and Fera look after Quinn, while Tesla and Enzo worry about Medina. Medina visits Sidonia, who works as a psychic. Sidonia tells Medina she will meet someone and be happy, but she must allow herself to fall in love again. Medina meets her ex-boyfriend, Jarrod, who is engaged to Lumina. He shows Medina some pastries which he learned how to make back when they were a couple, and wishes her a happy thirtieth birthday by \\"toasting\\" her with cannolis. Meanwhile, Quinn sniffs his Dear John letter one last time, and throws it in a garbage bin. As she finishes a workout and prepares to leave, Medina senses a presence. She turns around and addresses the voice that sounds like Master, and is reminded of his advice at the exam. She encounters Sidonia, who is sitting on a chair, on the city sidewalk and meditating. Sidonia reminds her of the party later; Medina thanks her and walks off. Quinn and Fera see Sidonia and ask for directions. She provides it and gives Quinn a pack of tissues to clean his camera lens. At Fran√ßoise's, Medina talks to the voice and they agree to part ways. Fera interrupts the conversation as she recognizes Medina as her favorite fashion designer. Camden calms Fera down, but Quinn is stunned upon seeing Medina, and Medina is likewise frozen. They break their trance; Medina is about to cry; Quinn offers her a tissue from the pack that Sidonia gave him. As Medina takes one, Quinn apologizes for disturbing her and walks away. Medina smells the tissue and is full of joy; she quickly turns and requests another from Quinn, who eagerly gives her the whole pack. Camden and Fera inform Quinn that their dinner reservations were denied because of a party. Medina realizes it's the same party that Enzo mentioned, so it must be for her. She invites Quinn, Camden and Fera to her party, and they excitedly accept. As they begin to walk away, Medina looks to the sky and smiles. With tissue in hand, she turns and joins Quinn and the others.

Release  On January 27, 2011 Villapaz posted a press release on PRWeb for the film. Bonnie Piesse interviewed with Backstage writer Dan Lehman. She described her music and film career, and her in role in Love Eterne. From April‚ÄìDecember 2011, Villapaz submitted the film to various film festivals.  Reception  Mark Bell of Film Threat cited numerous technical issues that detracted from the film. While he anticipated the film because on the cheerful Friends-like opening credits that resembled a television pilot, Bell considered the audio horrible for almost all of the movie, and was annoyed by the smudges on the camera lens for some of the scenes. Despite this, he considered Navia's performance of value when you can hear her. Duane L. Martin of Rogue Cinema also noted the audio problems and sound control, as well as the smudges. However, Richard Propes of The Independent Critic sympathized with the film's low $10,000 budget. He likened Navia's performance to Marisa Tomei and found the soundtrack music choices good. \\"There are bad reviews where I'd say 'Don't see this film!' and there are bad reviews where I lean more towards 'Give this filmmaker a chance. He's learning.' Love Eterne strikes me as a 'teachable moment' film for a new filmmaker learning his way around the obstacles and challenges of ultra-indie filmmaking.\\"  Awards and nominations  The film received some accolades among the film festivals. It received an Award of Merit in the Short Film category from The Accolade and from the Best Shorts competitions. It was an Honorable Mention in the Narrative Feature category for the second edition of the 2011 Los Angeles Movie Awards. It was officially selected by the New York International Independent Film & Video Festival and NewFilmmakers New York, for screening in November and December, respectively, in New York City.  Love Eterne Mourning (2013 film)  In 2013, with newer technology available, director Joseph Villapaz re-edited the film's scenes from scratch, and fixed the sound quality flaws from the previous release. A new opening scene was completed which contains the voice of Troiano (portrayed by Henry Martinez), the deceased fiance. The text boxes which originally garnered negative reviews was also removed. Villapaz also added new music. The short was submitted to film festivals with the title LOVE ETERNE mourning and became an Official Selection at the Wizard World Film Festival in Portland. The Bare Bones International Film Festival screened LOVE ETERNE mourning on April 5, 2014. It won the award for Best Family Dramedy Micro Short on April 13, 2014.  Remembering Love Eterne (2019 film)  In January 2019, a music video titled, Remembering Love Eterne, began appearing at film festivals. The film contains numerous clips from Love Eterne to music composed and arranged by director Joseph Villapaz using the Feel Good sound pool licensed from Producer Planet. As of February 24, 2019, the film has won Best Music Video from the Calcutta International Cult Film Festival, Festigious International Film Festival and the South Cinematographic Academy Film & Arts.

In theory, it was passed by the comitia curiata, which was also the source for leges curiatae pertaining to Roman adoption.Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999), p. 28. In the late Republic, historians and political theorists thought that the necessity of such a law dated to the Regal period, when kings after Romulus had to submit to ratification by the Roman people. Like many other aspects of Roman religion and law, the lex curiata was attributedCicero, De re publica 2.13 et passim. to Numa Pompilius, Rome's second king. This origin seems to have been reconstructed after the fact to explain why the law was required, at a time when the original intent of the ceremony conferring imperium was no longer understood.H.S. Versnel, Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph (Brill, 1970), p. 320; see pp. 320‚Äì322 for discussion of various views of the nature of this imperium and its relation to the lex curiata. The last two kings, however, were said to have ruled without such ratification,Lintott, Constitution, pp. 28‚Äì29, 222. which at any rate may have been more loosely acclamation.Lily Ross Taylor, Roman Voting Assemblies from the Hannibalic War to the Dictatorship of Caesar (University of Michigan Press, 1966, 1990), p. 3. The law was passed in an assembly that during the late Republic existed in name only, the comitia curiata, based on the curiae. The curiae were supposed to have been the thirty political divisions created by Romulus and named after the Sabine women, who were from Cures in Sabine territory. These political units were replaced as early as 218 BC by lictors; the people no longer assembled, as each curia was represented by a lictor, and confirmation was virtually automatic, unless a tribune chose to obstruct. Even then, an unconfirmed magistrate might forge ahead with the functions of his office regardless.L.R. Taylor, Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 4; Lintott, Constitution, pp. 28‚Äì29, 49. By the late Republic, a magistrate could simply dispense with this ratification in claiming his imperium, or a legislator could include a provision in a bill that rendered a curiate law redundant. The censors, by contrast, were confirmed by the comitia centuriata. It therefore becomes unclear what purpose the lex curiata continued to serve:Lintott, Constitution, pp. 28‚Äì29, 49. \\"The origin, nature, and importance of the lex curiata de imperio have been extensively and inconclusively debated.\\"S.P. Oakley, A Commentary on Livy, Books VI-X (Oxford University Press, 2005), vol. 3, p. 494 online. See also for ancient sources. It has sometimes been supposed that the lex curiata is what conferred the right to take auspices, though scholars are not unanimous on this point.Lintott, Constitution, p. 103. H.S. Versnel, in his study of the Roman triumph, argued that the lex curiata de imperio was a prerequisite for a commander before he could be awarded a triumph.Versnel, Triumphus, p. 168, note 2, citing Cicero, Ad Atticum 4.16.12. Imperium, Versnel maintained, was not granted to a commander within a political framework, but was rather a quality within the man that manifests itself and is acknowledged ceremonially by a lex curiata de imperio.Versnel, Triumphus, pp. 319-349, and 356 online. The lex was not fundamental to the holding of imperium or auspicium,Oakley, Commentary on Livy, p. 494. but was rather the act through which the people expressed their recognition of that authority.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 13. Even if the lex curiata became largely ceremonial, it retained enough force to be useful for political tactics when evoked. Tribunes could obstruct its passage; the consuls of 54 BC lacked the lex, and their legitimacy to govern as proconsuls was questioned; during the civil war, the consuls of 49 used their own lack of a lex as an excuse for not holding elections for their successors.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, pp. 493‚Äì494.

Dold earned the endorsement of the Chicago Tribune and Daily Herald. Schneider defeated Dold 51%‚Äì49%, a difference of just 3,000 votes. ;2014 On May 8, 2013, Dold announced in an e-mail to supporters that he would run for his old seat in 2014.

Tenure Reputation Dold is a moderate Republican with a centrist voting record in Congress. The non-partisan organization GovTrack has ranked Dold in the political center of Congress. National Journal did a comprehensive study of key votes in the House, ranking Dold as one of the most independent members of Congress.National Journal, February 25, 2012, Pages, 10‚Äì49 The district had traditionally elected moderate Republicans, such as Dold and his predecessors John Edward Porter and Mark Kirk. Dold is an original member of the No Labels movement which, Dold stated, he hoped would help to end the gridlock in Washington, DC. Dold is a member of the Tuesday Group, an informal caucus of moderate Republicans in the U.S. House. In 2015, Dold was elected co-chair of the Tuesday Group. An editorial in The Daily Herald noted Dold's spirit of bipartisanship and called for more Bob Dolds in Congress. According to Roll Call, Dold has moved further to the center during his second term in Congress. In fact, in 2015, The Lugar Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit founded by former Senator Richard Lugar released a Bipartisan Index in cooperation with Georgetown University, ranking Congressman Dold the fifth most bipartisan congressman (out of 438) in the 114th Congress. Political positions Dold supports abortion rights. In 2012, Dold introduced H.R. 5650, the Protecting Women's Access to Health Care Act, which prevents lawmakers from blocking funds to Planned Parenthood. He has voiced support for stem cell research. Dold voted for the fiscal cliff compromise bill, which permanently extended most of the Bush middle class tax cuts. He has stated his support for gay marriage and immigration reform. He became the first House Republican to support the Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include a ban on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, he has stated his desire to improve the law rather than fight to repeal or defund it. Dold has said the Affordable Care Act was right to require insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions and to allow students to stay on a parent's insurance to age 26. Upon his return to the House in 2015, Dold became one of just three Republican Congressmen to vote against repeal of the Affordable Care Act ‚Äì the first time any elected Republicans at the federal level voted against such a measure. Dold supports gun control measures. In 2015, he signed onto a bipartisan bill that would expand background checks for gun purchasers. He accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and believes steps should be taken to address the issue. In 2016, Dold introduced a bill to create a grant to expand the availability of naloxone, a heroin overdose antidote. Personnel Upon taking office in 2011, Dold hired former lobbyist Eric Burgeson, who grew up in Illinois' 10th district, as his congressional Chief of Staff. Burgeson and Dold had previously worked together on Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. Dold instituted a policy that \\"staff may not work on matters of substance with former clients.\\" In his second term in office, his chief of staff was James Slepian. Committee assignments Dold was originally appointed to the Committee on Financial Services for the 114th Congress, but after the resignation of fellow Illinois Republican Aaron Schock, Dold was chosen to replace him on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. *Committee on Ways and Means **Subcommittee on Human Resources **Subcommittee on Social Security ;Previous * Committee on Financial Services ** Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises ** Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity Personal life Dold is married and has three children.Candidate: Robert Dold , Chicago Tribune Dold resides in Kenilworth, Illinois and runs Rose Pest Solutions, the oldest pest control company in the country.Kenilworth businessman to enter 10th Dist.

It opened on July 1, 1995, and was the first stand-alone non-profit insect zoo in the United States. The facility is situated on of land, and contains five main exhibit areas to teach visitors about butterflies and other invertebrates. The main exhibit is an indoor rain forest filled with 1,200 free-flying tropical butterflies. The Butterfly Pavilion is a non-profit facility with most of its funding coming from admission fees, corporate sponsorship, and the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD) of Colorado. Because it imports non- native insect species, the Pavilion is regulated by the USDA. Butterfly Pavilion is an AZA accredited facility. History A butterfly at the Pavilion In 1990, the Rocky Mountain Butterfly Consortium was created with the intention of creating a public butterfly house. The Butterfly Pavilion and Insect Center, the first free-standing butterfly house and invertebrate zoo in the United States, was opened about five years later on July 15, 1995. It joined the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD) as a Tier II organization in 1996, and in 1997 launched their first outreach program, the Bugmobile, which serves 20,000 students annually as of 2010. In 1997, the Pavilion was also recognized as the fastest growing cultural attraction in Denver. In 1998, the administrative offices were converted into Water's Edge, a tide pool exhibit. In 2000, the Adult Education department was started, and in 2002, the Pavilion started offering accredited teacher enrichment courses in partnership with the Colorado School of Mines. 2003 saw the start of construction for a addition to the Pavilion, which was completed and opened in 2004. The new space included four classrooms, administrative offices, and a new exhibit space. In June 2007, the outdoor Dee Lidvall Discovery Garden was opened. The garden includes an educational amphitheater, habitat, sensory and xeriscape gardens, two gazebos, a patio, and a water feature with natural filtration. Its main purpose is to help link classroom education and the nature trail. In 2008, the Pavilion‚Äôs curatorial department manager, Mary Ann Hamilton, served as a consultant for the NASA experiment ‚ÄúButterflies and Spiders in Space.‚Äù She provided information for the teachers‚Äô guide and assisted with ground control experiments at the Pavilion and in several classrooms in Colorado. In February 2017, the group announced plans for a butterfly pavilion at the Gardens on Spring Creek in Fort Collins, with a planned 2019 opening. In May 2017, the group announced plans to move the main Westminster operation to the new Science and Technology Park being developed at Colorado 7 and Sheridan Pkwy. in Broomfield, about ten miles northeast of the main Westminster location. Exhibits Wings of the Tropics is a tropical conservatory with over 1,200 butterflies and 200 plant species from tropical rain-forests. On one side of the conservatory, visitors can watch the butterflies emerge from their chrisalides, and twice a day can watch the staff release them into the rain-forest. The Butterfly Pavilion purchases about 500 butterfly chrisalides each week from butterfly farms around the world. Crawl- A-See-Em lets visitors observe tarantulas, leaf insects, scorpions, beetles, and giant millipedes, and even hold Rosie, a Chilean rose hair tarantula. Water's Edge is about animals in Atlantic and Pacific Ocean tide pools. Visitors can see and touch sea stars, sea cucumbers, and horseshoe crabs. The Nature Trail is a just outside the Pavilion along Big Dry Creek. Here visitors can see Colorado's native insects, prairie dogs, and rabbits, and maybe even a heron, hawk, or eagle perched in a tree. The outdoor Dee Lidvall Discovery Garden includes a butterfly garden planted with pincushion flower, cosmos, nicotiana and other colorful flowers to attract local butterflies, and a xeriscape garden sponsored by the Colorado Cactus and Succulent Society that includes dry land plants such as cactus, hardy ice plant, penstemon, yarrow, and lavender. From mid-December to mid-January, Butterfly Pavilion also presents its Living Lights events on non-holiday Thurs.-Sun. nights.

Plot  The latest craze is $la$her$, a Japanese blood sport game show where contestants can win millions of dollars if they survive being hunted through various arenas by costumed killers. All crimes are legal on the sets of the show, and what few rules there are (like having to remain motionless during commercials) are enforced by shock collars that the players and murderers must wear. The latest episode of $la$her$ is an all-American special in which the six contestants (Megan, Devon, Michael, Rick, Rebecca, and Brenda) will be pursued by \\"newbie\\" slasher Preacherman, and returning fan favorites Chainsaw Charlie, and Doctor Ripper. A few minutes into the game, the contestants are scattered, with the single cameraman, Hideo, following Megan and Rebecca. The women are attacked by Preacherman, but Rebecca stabs him in the eye with a makeshift wooden stake. The victory is short-lived, as Charlie and Ripper appear, cut Rebecca in half at the waist, and terrorize Megan, who only volunteered to be on the show to protest it. Megan rejoins the others (with the exception of Devon) and together they reach the Bridge of Death, which is situated above a pit of spikes. The group is confronted by Charlie, just as a commercial occurs. During the break, Rick reveals he plans to save the others by throwing himself and Charlie off the bridge, which causes Charlie to panic, and agree to let Rick pass. When the show returns to the air, Rick reneges on the deal, jumping off the bridge, and dragging Charlie down with him, leaving only Doctor Ripper. In the next zone, Brenda is beheaded by Ripper, and Megan and Michael are chased to the Love Room, an area where players will be left alone if they have sex. When Megan rebuffs his advances, Michael tries to rape her, but is scared off by Devon, his screams subsequently emanating from the room he enters. Devon (who is separated from Megan) finds Michael's body, and is attacked by Ripper, who he stabs in the ear with a stake. Michael (who had faked his death) then kills Devon, takes Ripper's gear, and goes after Megan. As he pursues Megan, Michael reveals that he is in fact a serial killer, and that he only wanted to be on $la$her$ so he could die a spectacular death, though now that he has a chance of winning the game, he is going to take it. Michaels catches up to Megan just as another commercial airs, and during the down time he brags about his history as the Bible Doll Killer, content that the rules of $la$her$ make his declarations inadmissible in court. Megan turns the tables on Michael, stating that while what he says during the live broadcast cannot be used against him, the footage recorded by the always rolling camera while they are off the air can be used as evidence. The break ends, and Michael lunges at Megan, but is shoved away by Hideo. Distraught, Michael goes ahead with his original plan of dying on live television, and commits suicide by decapitating himself. Hideo mocks the dead Michael, asserting that Megan was bluffing, and catches up with Megan. When asked why he stopped Michael, Hideo says that while he is fine with whoever is stupid enough to volunteer to be on the show dying on it, he could not stand the thought of \\"that sick maniac\\" being back out on the streets, several million dollars richer. Megan rants at the staff of $la$her$, threatens to use all her winnings to try and bring them down, and tells Hideo (who has asked for money, since he will probably be fired for helping her) that she will pay him if he turns the camera off. As the credits roll, the sponsors of $la$her$ are shown to be the cigarette companies Black Lung, Coffin Nails, and Cancer Man.

Video Graveyard rated the film two and a half stars and called it \\"a ride that incorporates both horror and reality show clich√©s in a funny, gory manner\\" with \\"a great concept that is executed with confidence and does not hold back despite the budget\\". While it wrote that the acting was below average and the characters were unrealistic, The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre still found Slashers to be \\"a somewhat entertaining B movie\\". Scott Weinberg of eFilmCritic heavily criticized Slashers, writing that it was boring \\"bargain-basement dreck\\" that was witless, full of shoddy gore effects and painfully amateurish acting, and was ultimately nothing more than \\"low-grade horror machinations at their most confoundingly stupid\\". Bloody Disgusting rated it 1/5 stars and wrote that the film did not live up to its promising premise. Eric Campos of Film Threat rated it 1.5/5 stars and criticized the poor dialog that dominated the film at the expense of horror.

It was written by Susser, David Mich√¥d and Brian Charles Frank. Screened at the Sundance Film Festival January 22, 2010, the film was released in the United States on May 13, 2011. Most of the songs on the film's soundtrack are tracks from heavy metal bands Metallica and Mot√∂rhead. Plot Following the loss of his mother in a car crash, T.J. (Devin Brochu) falls into a state of depression. He becomes obsessed with the car his mother died in and follows it when it is towed away. He and his passive, depressed and pill-taking father Paul (Rainn Wilson) live with T.J.'s grandmother Madeleine (Piper Laurie), where they are soon joined by a squatter, Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a foul-mouthed, tattooed, heavy metal-loving lout. After school, Dustin, a bully from the towing service, finds his car vandalized and blames T.J., who is saved and taken home by Nicole (Natalie Portman), a grocery store clerk. Hesher witnesses Dustin attacking T.J., but does nothing. Later, Hesher sets Dustin's car on fire, leading to police questioning T.J., but lack of evidence forces them to let him go. T.J. proceeds to spy on Nicole at the grocery store when Hesher appears and follows her home with T.J. She causes a fender-bender and is verbally assaulted by the other driver, when Hesher comes to her rescue by threatening him. He then takes Nicole and T.J. to a random house that is for sale. There, Hesher trashes the swimming pool and lights the diving board on fire before he shocks Nicole and T.J. by leaving them there alone. When the pair get back to Nicole's broken down car, it has a ticket in the window, at which point Nicole breaks down and cries about how bad her life is. Later that night, T.J. and Paul get into an argument over dinner. Madeleine is saddened that there is 'nothing she can do', and goes to her room. Hesher says he'll walk with her in the morning, but the next morning, he finds her dead. T.J. steals his dad's credit card and takes money to buy the car back, but is told it's been removed. He decides to give the money to Nicole, but when he gets there she is having sex with Hesher, so he damages his van while telling both of them he doesn't want to see them again and leaves. He threatens Dustin at his house and finds out the car was taken to be crushed. Dustin begins attacking T.J. until Hesher, who has been following him, appears and drags Dustin off him. T.J. tells him he still doesn't want to see him again and then goes to the junkyard. He climbs in the wrecked car and sleeps, dreaming of his mother's death. He wakes up when the car is going to be crushed and falls out. He returns home after seeing it destroyed. While getting ready for his grandmother's funeral, Nicole comes and asks for forgiveness and leaves him. At the funeral, T.J. is asked to say words for her, but has nothing to say. Hesher walks in drunk, resisting efforts to throw him out and demands that the mourners listen to him. He tells a story about how when he was younger he blew up the gas tank of a car and shrapnel destroyed one of his testicles. He then explained that he got caught up in the loss of his testicle focusing on it so much that he forgot he had a right testicle and working penis. He then draws the parallel: you lost a wife, and you lost a mother; I lost a testicle. He then announces that he promised Grandma he‚Äôd go on a walk with her and proceeds to push the casket out of the room. T.J. and Paul stand agape and watch Hesher pushing the casket through the road. After a brief hesitation T.J. and Paul run to catch up and take a place on each side with their hands on the casket to help Hesher push and also to join the walk with Grandma. The next day, Paul shaves for the first time in weeks and tells T.J. that Hesher is gone. Then he shows T.J. the compacted remains of his mother's car, which sits in the driveway. The screen draws back and then we see on the roof Hesher has spray painted in huge white letters, \\"Hesher was here.\\" Cast * Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Hesher * Rainn Wilson as Paul Forney * Natalie Portman as Nicole * Devin Brochu as T.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 54% of 68 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.7 out of 10 and a consensus stating \\"It has a dark sense of humor and a refreshing lack of sentimentality, but like its title character, Hesher isn't really interested in going anywhere.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 45 based on 26 reviews. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film and Gordon-Levitt's performance, stating \\"So what if Hesher flies off its wobbly handles ‚Äî it keeps springing funny and touching surprises. The performances are aces. Wilson makes Dad's emergence a subtle marvel. And even when the script edges Gordon-Levitt into Hallmark sentiment, you can't take your eyes off him.\\" However, other critics, such as Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film more lukewarm reviews. Ebert said, \\"Hesher assembles a group of characters who aren't sure why they're in the same movie together. One by one, they have an attraction, but brought together, they're all elbows and angles.\\" References External links   Category:2010 films Category:2010 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films produced by Natalie Portman Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Ontario Category:American independent films Category:2010 directorial debut films Category:2010 comedy films Category:2010 drama films Category:2010 independent films ","title":"Hesher (film)"},{"id":"26100635","text":"Scarp Mountain is located on the border of Alberta and British Columbia.

The title was released in Japan on April 1, 2010 and in North America on September 21, 2010. It's a sequel to Etrian Odyssey II: Heroes of Lagaard and is followed by Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan. Players assume the role of a guild leader, adventuring into the labyrinth to fulfill quests.  Gameplay  This game follows in the footsteps of its predecessors with one screen showing a 3D view of the Wizardry-style dungeon, while the other one shows an overhead display of the map that players must maintain. Like its predecessors, the game only partially maps the terrain for you. Players make use of a mapping system which lets them freely place icons on a gridded map. These navigation icons can represent sea currents, landmarks, and footnotes of the terrain that players encountered. In Etrian Odyssey III, there are no pre-made playable characters. Players have to build their own guild by creating characters from a number of different character types (classes). Each class has its own skills and statistics, as well as limits on what equipment the character can wear. Although no more than five characters can be in the player's active party at the same time, up to 30 characters can be added to a guild, and players can switch out characters in town. This third game in the series provides 12 all-new classes, as well as the ability to subclass (gaining most of the second class' skill set) with the exception of an unlockable class, the Yggdroid, which cannot be subclassed but can learn sub classes. Another addition was the option to \\"set sail\\" on a ship that you are able to get after the first mission is completed. Your voyages depends on the amount of provisions that you have at the moment, restricting your movement only for the amount of spaces that the provisions allow you to advance. While at sea, the mapping system is the same as on the labyrinth, only with the addition of new navigation icons exclusive for sea mapping (e.g. whirlpools and islands). However, while sailing, there are no random encounters and no monsters except for pirate ships roaming the same ways as F.O.E.s on the labyrinth which, on contact, will sink your ship. Mission assignments for the player while on the sea will be to locate and reach foreign ports in order to restore Armoroad's trading roads. Once a foreign port has been reached, a sea quest option will be available. The sea quest option will be to get rid of certain unique monsters that can only be found in that specific area, meaning that in order to complete the monster discovery book, the sea quest is mandatory. Another addition not seen in the first two games is customizing weapons through forging. Forging is the act of including an effect in the weapon of your choice as long as the needed materials have been provided beforehand and the weapon has enough \\"sockets\\" or blank spaces to place the corresponding forge, along with the required money to pay for it. In order for this to be available, different \\"hammers\\" with the desired effects need to be found either through quest or in chest located all over the labyrinth.  Plot  The game is set in a sea city known as Armoroad, which is surrounded by the beautiful ocean. Armoroad prospered in the ancient time with high-level civilization. However, because of the great earthquake that happened a hundred years ago, the central part of the city sank down into the bottom of the sea, along with its superior technology. After the \\"Great Disaster\\", a labyrinth appeared in the hole of the city created by the earthquake. People from all over the world gathered around Armoroad to find clues that will lead them to the vanished city. Adventurers embarked down into the enormous hole, which devoured most part of the city and the lost technology. Some sought for the truth behind the \\"Great Disaster\\", while the others sought the treasures buried deepest under the sea.  Development  Shigeo Komori, the director of Etrian Odyssey II and III, told the reasons of adding the \\"sea\\" element to the new entry of the series during an interview. Komori said that the image of Etrian Odyssey was a green sea of trees and that of Etrian Odyssey II was the chill sky of North Europe. When he came to think about the theme for the third title, he felt really attracted by the warm southern sea.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Famitsu gave it three nines and one eight, for a total of 35 out of 40; they said that \\"the core charm of the series, with its Wizardry-style gameplay and player-built maps, is as strong as ever.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2010 video games Category:Atlus games Category:First-person party-based dungeon crawler video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games scored by Yuzo Koshiro Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender 3 The Drowned City ","title":"Etrian Odyssey III"},{"id":"26100700","text":"This is a list of notable people affiliated with the University of Texas at Arlington.

Initially he used his own librettos and compositions for a portion of the work and, eventually, the remainder by Giovanni Tadolini, who composed six additional movements. Rossini presented the completed work to Varela as his own. It was composed late in his career after retiring from the composition of opera. He began the work in 1831 but did not complete it until 1841. Composition In 1831 Rossini was traveling in Spain in the company of his friend the Spanish banker, Alexandre Aguado, owner of Ch√¢teau Margaux. In the course of the trip, Fern√°ndez Varela, a state councillor, commissioned a setting of the traditional liturgical text, the Stabat Mater. Rossini managed to complete part of the setting of the sequence in 1832, but ill health made it impossible for him to complete the commission. Having written only half the score (nos. 1 and 5‚Äì9), he asked his friend Giovanni Tadolini to compose six additional movements. Rossini presented the completed work to Varela as his own. It was premiered on Holy Saturday of 1833 in the Chapel of San Felipe el Real in Madrid, but this version was never again performed.Gossett, (1983). p. 55.Greenwald, Helen M. (2010). \\"Gioachino Rossini. 'Stabat Mater'\\". Boston Symphony Orchestra Program Notes for March 18, 2010. Accessed March 17, 2010. When Varela died, his heirs sold the work for 2,000 francs to a Parisian music publisher, Antoine Aulagnier, who printed it. Rossini protested, claiming that he had reserved publication rights for himself, and disowned Aulagnier's version, since it included the music by Tadolini. Although surprised by this, Aulangier went ahead and arranged for a public performance at the Salle Herz on October 31, 1841, at which only the six pieces by Rossini were performed. In fact, Rossini had already sold the publication rights for 6,000 francs to another Paris publisher, Eug√®ne Troupenas. Lawsuits ensued, and Troupenas emerged the victor. Rossini finished the work, replacing the music by Tadolini, before the end of 1841. The brothers L√©on and Marie Escudier, who had purchased the performing rights of Rossini's final version of the score from Troupenas for 8,000 francs, sold them to the director of the Th√©√¢tre- Italien for 20,000 francs, who began making preparations for its first performance.Gossett (1983), p. 59.

Rossini's extensive operatic career had divided the public into admirers and critics. The announcement of the premiere of Rossini's Stabat Mater provided an occasion for a wide-ranging attack by Richard Wagner, who was in Paris at the time, not only on Rossini but more generally on the current European fashion for religious music and the money to be made from it. A week before the scheduled concert Robert Schumann's Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik carried the pseudonymous essay, penned by Wagner under the name of \\"H. Valentino\\", in which he claimed to find Rossini's popularity incomprehensible: \\"It is extraordinary! So long as this man lives, he'll always be the mode.\\" Wagner concluded his polemic with the following observation: \\"That dreadful word: Copyright‚Äîgrowls through the scarce laid breezes. Action! Action! Once more, Action! And money is fetched out, to pay the best of lawyers, to get documents produced, to enter caveats.‚ÄîO ye foolish people, have ye lost your hiking for your gold? I know somebody who for five francs will make you five waltzes, each of them better than that misery of the wealthy master's!\\"Wagner Library: (R. Wagner), \\"Rossini's Stabat Mater,\\" translated by William Ashton Ellis At the time when Wagner wrote this, he was still in his late twenties and he had not yet had much success with the acceptance of his own music in the French capital. Performance history The Stabat Mater was performed complete for the first time in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien's Salle Ventadour on 7 January 1842, with Giulia Grisi (soprano), Emma Albertazzi (mezzo- soprano), Mario (tenor), and Antonio Tamburini (baritone) as the soloists. The Escudiers reported that: > Rossini's name was shouted out amid the applause. The entire work > transported the audience; the triumph was complete. Three numbers had to be > repeated...and the audience left the theater moved and seized by an > admiration that quickly won all Paris. In March Gaetano Donizetti led the Italian premiere in Bologna with great success. The soloists included Clara Novello (soprano) and Nikolay Ivanov (tenor). Donizetti reported the public's reaction: > The enthusiasm is impossible to describe. Even at the final rehearsal, which > Rossini attended, in the middle of the day, he was accompanied to his home > to the shouting of more than 500 persons. The same thing the first night, > under his window, since he did not appear in the hall. Despite the fact that the work is markedly different from his secular compositions, Northern German critics, as reported by Heinrich Heine in an essay on Rossini, criticised the work as \\"too worldly, sensuous, too playful for the religious subject.\\" In response the French music historian Gustave Chouquet has remarked that \\"it must not be forgotten that religion in the South is a very different thing from what it is in the North.\\" Music The Stabat Mater is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and bass), mixed chorus, and an orchestra of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, and strings. Rossini divided the poem's twenty 3-line verses into ten movements and used various combinations of forces for each movement: # Stabat Mater dolorosa (verse 1) ‚Äì Chorus and all four soloists # Cujus animam (verses 2‚Äì4) ‚Äì Tenor # Quis est homo (verses 5‚Äì6) ‚Äì Soprano and mezzo-soprano # Pro peccatis (verses 7‚Äì8) ‚Äì Bass # Eja, Mater (verses 9‚Äì10) ‚Äì Bass recitative and chorus # Sancta Mater (verses 11‚Äì15) ‚Äì All four soloists # Fac ut portem (verses 16‚Äì17) ‚Äì Mezzo- soprano # Inflammatus (verses 18‚Äì19) ‚Äì Soprano and chorus # Quando corpus morietur (verse 20) ‚Äì Chorus and all four soloists # In sempiterna saecula. Amen (not part of the standard text) ‚Äì Chorus Written in 1841 for tenor solo, the andantino maestoso section \\"Cuius animam\\", with its rollicking and memorable tune, is often performed apart from the work's other movements as a demonstration of the singer's bravura technique. The first theme in \\"Cujus animam\\" was also quoted note-for-note in the 1941 Woody Herman jazz number, \\"Blues on Parade\\".

On April 26, 2015, the Church for All Nations held its last service. Members of the congregation still worship as All Nations Lutheran Church in a rehearsal studio at 244 West 54th Street.All Nations Lutheran Church website The church itself is now, in 2018, Our Saviour New York and is directed by lead pastor Matt Popovits and Mark Budenholzer. On February 7, 2001 the building was designated a New York City landmark under the name \\"Catholic Apostolic Church\\".Shockley, Jay (February 7, 2001) \\"Catholic Apostolic Church Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission History The original Catholic Apostolic sanctuary on 16th Street Catholic Apostolics first began worshiping in New York City in 1848, utilizing a sanctuary at 126 West 16th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. By 1885, the congregation numbered around 400, and it purchased two lots for a new church \\"in a middling area of tenements and flats.\\"Gray, Christopher. New York Streetscapes: Tales of Manhattan‚Äôs Significant Buildings and Landmarks. (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2003), p.163. The English-trained American architect Francis H. Kimball designed the Victorian Gothic Revival church in 1897. The design features deep red bricks and abundant terra-cotta ornamentation, typical of Kimball's noted style. The doorway arches deeply protrude from the church with molded terra-cotta leaves and angelic heads; the building is set back from the street by a black wrought-iron fence with flame- shaped posts. It was praised by influential New York architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler, who wrote that there was \\"no more scholarly Gothic work in New York.\\" By 1893, the church hosted two daily services, recorded in King's Handbook of New York City. Because of a lack of clergy in the greater Catholic Apostolic Church, the Episcopal priest Henry Ogden DuBois served as Angel of the church in conjunction with his Episcopal duties, until his death in 1949. When the church had diminished to a few members, it was decided to donate the structure to another church instead of allowing the structure to be adaptively reused for a secular purpose. In 1995, the church was donated to the Lutheran Life's Journey Ministries. The congregation became a member of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod in 1997.

With approximately 4,000 employees in 2008, it provides services to the state's current and emerging workforce. History The department was originally created in 1911 and called the Department of Commerce and Labor. It was tasked with overseeing labor laws and safety regulations. The passage of the Wagner-Peyser Act in 1935, which established a nationwide system of public employment offices, led to the creation of the Department of Labor in 1937. The state labor commissioner, an elected official, oversees the department. The current commissioner, Mark Butler, assumed office in 2011. Administrative mission Today the Department of Labor administers the state's workforce programs, including unemployment insurance benefits and employment services, and carries out the requirements of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998, an initiative designed to promote employment opportunities and job training using federal funds. The department is also charged with providing workforce information to the public and private sectors and for administering laws governing work conditions, employee safety, and child labor issues. With passage of the WIA, the Department of Labor became responsible for providing workforce development services to employers and workers through comprehensive career centers, which take the place of traditional unemployment offices. As of 2008 the department operated fifty- three career centers in Georgia, providing the state's job seekers with information about training and educational resources, as well as financial aid and other support. The Technical College System of Georgia, in partnership with the Department of Labor, administers career centers on each of the system's campuses around the state. In addition to providing such workforce services as assistance in claiming unemployment benefits, finding a job, training for a job, or surviving a layoff, the Department of Labor also provides support services through a program called GoodWorks. The program helps applicants and recipients of TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), as well as noncustodial parents, prepare for, find, and maintain employment. The department no longer supervises the state's vocational rehabilitation services. The Vocational Rehabilitation Agency now supervises the state's vocational rehabilitation services, including the operation of the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, which treats patients with post-polio symptoms, spinal cord injuries, strokes, and other disabilities. The Vocational Rehabilitation Agency also administers the Business Enterprise Program and Georgia Industries for the Blind; both programs offer services for citizens with visual impairments. Through its safety engineering division, the Department of Labor conducts safety inspections and offers workplace safety programs. This division is also responsible for collecting data on workplace injuries that occur in Georgia. The child labor division administers and monitors restrictions for employees less than eighteen years of age and also helps to create summer jobs for youth in communities where suitable jobs are scarce. In 2007 the department provided $1 million to create jobs for 830 children between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one. Data collection Workforce information provided by the Department of Labor includes industry data, labor force and unemployment statistics, occupational trends, and general economic information. The department also holds an annual televised job fair, in conjunction with Georgia Public Broadcasting, which familiarizes Georgia citizens with the services available through the department and its workforce partners. The 2007 job fair, broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet, focused on the department's assistance services to displaced workers, particularly those affected by plant closures and natural disasters.

The band is made up of Kristofer Dommin on vocals and guitar, Billy James on bass, Konstantine on keyboards, and Cameron Morris on drums. Dommin released their major label debut album, Love is Gone, on February 2, 2010 on Roadrunner Records. History Formation and Mend Your Misery (1999-2008) Dommin's beginning can be traced back to 1999, from early demos Kristofer would record with his older brother, Stephen, playing drums. Over nearly an 8-year period, Dommin evolved into a performing rock band in the L.A. scene. Childhood friend, Billy James, originally joined as a keyboardist in late 2002. He eventually switched to bass when Konstantine joined the band in 2006. The last member to join Dommin was drummer Cameron Morris, who auditioned for the band and joined in 2008 to replace the vacancy left by Kristofer's older brother who went on to focus on his career and family. In 2005, Kristofer unknowingly had one of his demos reach the ears of producer, songwriter and manager, Lucas Banker who had a production company with his partner Logan Mader, known for his involvement in Machine Head and Soulfly. The production duo agreed to record what would become the band's independent release called Mend Your Misery. The band took to the social networking site, MySpace, and began to promote their music, sell their CD and T-shirts and recorded a video for \\"My Heart, Your Hands,\\" directed by the band's own Konstantine. Kristofer signed his publishing deal with Reverb, an independent UK publisher in June 2006. Through the efforts of Reverb Publishing and Dirty Icon Productions, Dommin's music was shopped to various labels and management. In late 2006, Dommin's efforts caught the attention of Monte Conner, Head of A&R; at Roadrunner Records and signed with them in June 2008. Love Is Gone (2009-2011) Lead singer/guitarist and primary songwriter Kristofer Dommin performing live. In February 2010, their major label debut Love Is Gone produced by Dirty Icon (Lucas Banker & Logan Mader) was released. One year prior to the album's release and all throughout 2009, Dommin opened for Combichrist, Wednesday 13, The Birthday Massacre and Lacuna Coil. They also performed at The Warped Tour in the United States. The two official singles from \\"Love Is Gone\\" were \\"My Heart, Your Hands\\" and \\"Tonight.\\" \\"My Heart, Your Hands\\" was featured as iTunes 'Song of The Week. The release coincided with the band's first trip to Europe with two back to back tours supporting Lacuna Coil and HIM. Dommin continued supporting HIM through their US tour and returned to Europe to perform at The Rock Am Ring/Rock Im Park festivals in Germany. They also opened the Main Stage on the final day of the Download Festival in the United Kingdom. That summer, Dommin received nominations as Best New Band and Best New International Artist at both of UK's Metal Hammer Awards and Kerrang Awards, respectively. In August, Dommin supported Volbeat and closed out the year supporting The Birthday Massacre and Black Veil Brides. To commemorate the end of the \\"Love Is Gone\\" album cycle, a third video was self-directed and produced for the song \\"Closure.\\" The band used photos and videos submitted by their fans with live footage as a tribute to the many lives that identified with the self-empowerment message of the song. In early 2011, Dommin performed at the Soundwave Festival in Australia, which included a sideshow in Melbourne supporting Rob Zombie. Departure from Roadrunner and Rise (2012-present) The band has been working on writing and recording for their follow up effort since 2011. According to a post made by the band on Dommin‚Äôs official Facebook page the album will ‚Äúmost likely [be released] late Summer. August or September‚Äù of 2012. On October 28, 2012, Dommin premiered a new song and video on their Facebook and official website, title \\"The Quiet Man\\". On October 30, 2012, the band launched an updated website, with news that they have parted ways with Roadrunner. Shortly after, Kristofer Dommin expressed his and the band's current contractual situation and disappointment with Roadrunner, who still 'owns' the rights to some of their unreleased material and their second studio album, regardless of their dropping the band. This has led the group to a hiatus until all contractual obligations with Roadrunner are resolved and in return making the group 'free-agents' for a new contract. In the midst of this, Kristofer Dommin has posted five songs on his personal Facebook, including a brand new track titled \\"Desire\\" (which for a period of time was given to fans for free along with a newsletter subscription), an incomplete track titled \\"I Die\\" with keyboardist Konstantine, a cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Im Your Man\\", a cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Precious\\", and a cover of Sia's \\"Breathe Me\\".

Marriage and family law Young women in Taiwan Taiwanese bhiksuni (Buddhist nun) at a Vesak celebration, serving Oolong tea Throughout the 20th century, married women's rights were severely restricted, but they gradually improved, especially due to legal changes made in the last 20 years (the family law was revised five times between 1996 and 2002). In 1895, Taiwan came under Japanese rule and Japanese marriage laws (which discriminated against women) were applied. After Japan's defeat in 1945, the section of family law from the Civil Law promulgated on the Republican mainland in 1930, came into force in Taiwan, too (family law was later changed in the mainland by the communist regime, but this did not apply to Taiwan). The 1930 Taiwanese Civil Code provided limited rights to Taiwanese women, such as having no right in deciding their residence, the lack of right to own property, the lack of right to file a divorce, the lack of self- protection, and the lack of right to child custody, and discrimination against illegitimate children.Taiwanese Women's Rights - Call for HELP, From the Awakening Foundation in Taipei, Taiwan, hartford-hwp.com, 15 March 1995 The situation of married women improved slightly due to changes made in 1985 and 1996. By 1998, the new regulations had made divorce a little easier, allowed the wife to keep her own property registered in her name before 1985 without proving that she previously owned it; and allowed the judge to consider the best interest of children when evaluating the custody of children in a divorce case. Yet these changes did not go as \\"far\\" as giving wives equal rights with husbands, as the continuation of the influence of patriarchal ideology with regards to family matters was maintained: the male still had superiority in decisions related to the wife's residence, disciplinary measures for their offsprings, and managing property.The Report on Women's Status in Taiwan, taiwan.yam.org.tw In 1998, the Domestic Violence Prevention Lawhttp://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/CHINAtai.dv.98.htm came into force, dealing with domestic violence. New changes to the family law between 1998 and 2000, provided that the husband and wife's domicile is that which is agreed upon by them, rather than necessarily that of the husband's; and amended the law on legal guardians of a minor. Marriage regulations are currently based on gender equality, being found in Chapter II- Marriage of the Civil Code (Articles 972 - 1058).http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=B0000001 Mothers and fathers now have equal rights towards their children: the original Article 1089 stated that parental rights should be exercised by the father if the father and the mother did not share the same views, but this provision was declared unconstitutional (in contradiction of Article 7 of the Constitution),The Legal Culture and System of Taiwan, by Chang-fa Lo, pp 144 and, as such, Article 1089 was amended to read: \\"[...] If there is inconsistency between the parents in the exercise of the rights in regard to the grave events of the minor child, they may apply to the court for the decision in accordance with the best interests of the child\\". Also, the Article 1019 (which stipulated that only the husband had the right to manage the shared property of a married couple, and had the right to use and receive profits from property that originally belonged to his wife, and not vice versa ) was repealed. Constitutional protections Women's rights are protected in the Constitution of Taiwan: Article 7 states: \\"All citizens of the Republic of China, irrespective of sex, religion, race, class, or party affiliation, shall be equal before the law\\".

However, Section 123 protected all publications and opinions on any religious subject expressed in good faith and decent language against prosecution and specified that prosecution may proceed only with the leave of the attorney-general. On 5 March 2019, Parliament unanimously passed the Crimes Amendment Bill, which repealed Section 123 of the Crimes Act. The bill received the Royal Assent on 11 March 2019 and came into force the following day. Origin of New Zealand blasphemy law The New Zealand offence of blasphemous libel originated in England with the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. All English common law offences were received into New Zealand law in 1840. In 1893, the New Zealand Criminal Code Act 1893, based on the work of James Fitzjames Stephen and developments by George Burbidge in the Canadian Criminal Code, 1892, omitted the common law offence of blasphemy but retained the offence of blasphemous libel in section 133 with safeguards to prevent overuse and abuse of the law. Queensland followed seven years later with the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) which abolished common law offences and omitted both blasphemy and blasphemous libel from the code. Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, who was responsible for the development of the Queensland code, stated that it did not include those provisions of English law which were ‚Äúmanifestly obsolete or inapplicable to Australia‚Äù. The New Zealand Crimes Act 1908 replaced the Criminal Code Act 1893 and the 1908 Act was in turn replaced by the Crimes Act 1961. Section 133 on blasphemous libel in the New Zealand Criminal Code Act 1893 became Section 150 of the Crimes Act 1908 and then Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 with minor updating of the language. Section 6 of the 1893 Act and Section 5 of the 1908 Act abolished common law offences. Section 9 of the Crimes Act 1961 expanded Section 150 of the 1908 Act to abolished all common law offences including blasphemy and blasphemous libel and any possibility of convictions under any Act of the Parliament of England, Great Brittan, or the United Kingdom; removing any ambiguity regarding the continual existence of common law offences in New Zealand. Section 123 of the 1961 Act does not define blasphemous libel or indicate the religion to which the law applies, leaving this to the common law.  Religion to which the offences relate  In England, where the offences originated, the question was considered settled in 1838 by Gathercole's Case. Baron Charles Alderson, speaking for the court, declared that \\"A person may, without being liable to prosecution for it, attack Judaism, or Mahomedanism, or even any sect of the Christian religion (save the established religion of the country); and the only reason why the latter is in a different situation from the others is, because it is the form established by law, and is, therefore, a part of the constitution of the country\\".R v Gathercole (1838) 2 Lew CC 237 at 254, (1838) 168 ER 1140 at 1145Select Committee on Religious Offences in England and Wales First Report Appendix 3 , 2003 It might, therefore, be assumed that if the laws of blasphemy and blasphemous libel ever applied in New Zealand they applied only to the Church of England. However, as New Zealand and other states and territories within the Realm of New Zealand have never had an established religion, it is doubtful that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were received into New Zealand law or could be enforced in New Zealand, or that Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 can be applied in New Zealand. The English blasphemy laws were also received into Australian law and the question of the religion to which the laws relate has been considered by Australian law commissions. Their findings are of direct relevance to New Zealand. In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission stated that \\"The law of blasphemy is an ancient common law offence constituted by the publication of material which provokes outrage in Christians by insulting, ridiculing or vilifying God, Christ or the Christian religion as practised in the Church of England\\".Australian Law Reform Commission report 57 ‚Äì Multiculturalism and the Law, 1992 pdf version In 1994, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission added that \\"The common law offence of blasphemy applies only to scurrilous criticism of the fundamental tenets of the Church of England and other Christian denominations of coincident conviction. Such discrimination by the law in favour of a particular religion is itself an indicator of the need for review and possible reform.\\"NSW Law Reform Commission: REPORT 74 (1994) ‚Äì BLASPHEMY In 1998, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in a report titled Article 18 ‚Äì Freedom of religion and belief made use of the following definition: \\"Blasphemy is an ancient English common law offence defined as a publication containing contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ, the Bible or the formularies of the Church of England which are calculated to provoke outrage in the feelings of any sympathiser or believer in Christianity. A person who publishes any blasphemous document is guilty of publishing a blasphemous libel.\\"Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report Article 18 ‚Äì Freedom of religion and belief. pdf versionThis definition was approved in an obiter statement in Ogle v Strickland (1987) 71 ALR 4, per Justice Lockhart at page 52, who quoted the definition from Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law 9th edition, 1950, page 163.  Position of the Anglican church  The New Zealand law of blasphemous libel originated with the English common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel that were intended to protect the tenets of the Church of England, but the Church of England no longer supports the retention of these laws, either in England or New Zealand. At a meeting in the chapel of the Houses of Parliament in early 2015, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said that Christians must stand up for religious freedom of atheists and Muslims as much as themselves and that he was opposed to all restrictions on freedom of speech concerning religion which did not constitute hate speech. He thanked the former MP Evan Harris, a humanist, for his efforts to abolish the blasphemy laws in the UK. Interviewed by The Dominion Post on 8 May 2017, Anglican Archbishop Philip Richardson said the law against blasphemous libel was pointless, saying \\"My view is, God's bigger than needing to be defended by the Crimes Act\\". Richardson, known as Bishop of Taranaki and Tikanga Pakeha Archbishop and Primate of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, said that he found it surprising New Zealand still had a blasphemy law in place. In a different interview he added: \\"It is an archaic and unhelpful law and it should be repealed. Freedom of speech is a fundamental of democracy, and indeed as any parent knows, freedom is a consequence of love.\\"  Law Commission reports  The New Zealand Law Commission has not given close consideration to the abolition of New Zealand's blasphemy laws. Law Commissions in England, where the laws originated, and Australia have however considered the question and recommended the abolition of all blasphemy laws. England In England, the continued existence of the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel was controversial. In 1985 the Law Commission published a report on Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship, that recommended the abolition of all blasphemy offences. The report noted that \\"there is no one agreed definition of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and that it would scarcely be practicable, even if it thought desirable, to amend the common law definition by statute\\". The authors added that \\"it is now clear that none of the arguments for retaining a law of blasphemy are sufficiently strong to support this view and each of them is outweighed by other considerations which persuade us that a law of blasphemy is not a necessary part of a criminal code. Moreover, we have no doubt that any replacement offence which might be devised would in practice prove to be unacceptably wide in ambit.\\" The Commission concluded, \\"that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement\\".The Law Commission No. 145 Criminal Law: Offences against Religion and Public Worship. HC 442 1984‚Äì85. These two offences were subsequently abolished in July 2008. Australia As Australian blasphemy law shares a common origin with New Zealand blasphemy law, Australian law commission reports are relevant to New Zealand. In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission produced Report 57 on Multiculturalism and the Law which \\"considers the role of the common law offence of blasphemy in federal law\\". The Commission noted that as blasphemy is not specifically defined in any Australian legislation it must be assumed that the English common law definition of blasphemy applies. The Commission considered Australia's international obligations under covenants and conventions to which Australia is a party: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression, the enjoyment of one's culture, the profession and practice of one's religion and the use of one's own language in community with other members of one's ethnic and religious community; and parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), undertake to guarantee the right of everyone to equality before the law and equality in the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of peaceful assembly and association. The commission noted that blasphemy law provides only limited protection as religious affiliations are many and diverse. Although most Australians describe themselves as Christian, a growing minority (more than 300,000 in 1986) are members of non-Christian religious faiths, particularly Islam, Buddhism and Judaism, and that nearly two million Australians do not subscribe to any religion. The offence of blasphemy, however, protects only the Christian religion, with specific reference to the rituals and doctrines of the Anglican Church. Offences that involve the common law of blasphemy apply only to material that vilifies Christianity. This is not consistent with Australia's human rights obligations. The commission proposed that all references to ‚Äòblasphemous‚Äô material in federal law should be removed. The commission reported that \\"it is argued that extending blasphemy law to cover all religions would raise serious difficulties in defining ‚Äòreligions‚Äô and ‚Äògods‚Äô, would have grave consequences for freedom of speech and might contribute to religious conflict. On the other hand, removing all references to blasphemy in federal law would have the effect of removing an apparently preferential position of one religion and moving towards a situation of parity between religions in federal law. For this reason it should be done. In so far as blasphemy causes hurt to a person's sensibilities, the existing provisions on offensive behaviour and other public order offences are sufficient.\\" The report concluded with the recommendation that the criminal law be amended so that \\"all references to blasphemy in federal legislation should be removed\\". New South Wales In 1994 the New South Wales Law Reform Commission released a report on blasphemy after considering the law in New South Wales, other Australian states and territories, other jurisdictions in the region, the history of the law, international developments, freedom of speech, and public submissions. After considering possible options, the Commission recommended that all blasphemy law be abolished without replacement. The Commission pointed out that every other law reform agency in Australia and in other common law countries which had considered the question had likewise recommended the abolition of the offence of blasphemy. The report with its conclusions and recommendation is equally applicable to other Australian states and territories.  Prosecutions in New Zealand  The only prosecution for blasphemous libel in New Zealand before the 2019 repeal of section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 was the case of John Glover, publisher of the newspaper The Maoriland Worker in 1922 for the publication of two poems by British poet Siegfried Sassoon, although the poems were widely available in other publications and bookstores at the time. The Crown laid a charge of blasphemous libel over the 12 October 1921 issue of The Maoriland Worker which included the two poems. The alleged blasphemy was the closing lines of Sassoon's poem 'Stand-to: Good Friday Morning': :O Jesus, send me a wound to- day, :And I'll believe in Your bread and wine, :And get my bloody old sins washed white! The case was tried in the Supreme Court, now known as the High Court, in 1922. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty with a rider: \\"That similar publications of such literature be discouraged\\". The Supreme Court of 1922 was established in 1841 but renamed the High Court in 1980 to allow for the establishment of a higher court known as the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 2004. In 1998, the Crown decided not to prosecute Te Papa museum for displaying Tania Kovats' Virgin in a Condom and Sam Taylor-Wood's Wrecked, a contemporary photograph based on Leonardo da Vinci's, The Last Supper, which featured a topless woman at the centre of the table in place of Christ. In 2006, the Crown decided not to pursue blasphemy charges against CanWest, a broadcaster, for airing an episode of South Park featuring a menstruating Virgin Mary statue. The former section 123(4) of the Crimes Act 1961 required the leave of the Attorney-General before charges of blasphemous libel could proceed. The Attorney-General usually refused to pursue prosecutions on the basis of free speech objections as the right to free speech is protected by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.  Censorship  Apart from the use of Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961, attempts have been made to censor films and television programmes considered blasphemous using broadcasting standards and film censorship legislation such as the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 and the Broadcasting Act 1989. Correspondence on whether Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979) should be banned in New Zealand for blasphemy. The British comedy film Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979) about a fictional Jewish man living at the same time and neighbourhood as Jesus Christ, generated significant international controversy and was banned in several countries including Ireland and Norway. Hundreds of letters were sent to the New Zealand Film Censor's Office to have the film banned in New Zealand as well on the grounds of it being 'blasphemous' against the Christian faith, but the Chief Censor of Films responded by stating that they had found no evidence of blasphemy or sacrilegiousness in the film. In February 2006, the broadcaster CanWest screened the ‚ÄúBloody Mary‚Äù episode of the South Park cartoon series featuring a menstruating Virgin Mary statue. The following June, the Broadcasting Standards Authority responded to complaints by upholding CanWest's right to broadcast the episode finding no breach of the Television Code of Broadcasting Practice. The High Court, considering an appeal by Bishop Denis Browne, in his capacity as the President of the Catholic Bishops Conference, affirmed the Broadcasting Standards Authority's decision in July 2007. Dismissing the appeal in the High Court, Justice Wild said that he was ‚Äúnot prepared to second-guess the weight that the Authority accorded to the right to freedom of expression, relative to the right to respect for religious beliefs‚Äù and was not prepared to accept that the Authority was wrong to hold that the episode did not breach the standard of good taste and decency. Justice Wild noted that the four members of the Authority were unanimous and that the Conference's sense of outrage was not shared by the wider community.  New Zealand blasphemy law and the United Nations  New Zealand signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on 12 November 1968, ratified it on 28 December 1978 and it came into force on 28 March 1979. This covenant binds signatory countries. The UN Human Rights Committee adopted General Comment 34UN Human Rights Committee General Comment 34, adopted July 2011 in July 2011 that stated in paragraph 48 that \\"Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant ‚Ä¶ \\". New Zealand also signed the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) on the 25 October 1966 and ratified it on 22 November 1972.United Nations Treaty Collection (ICERD) This Convention includes an individual complaints mechanism, effectively making it enforceable against its parties, and is monitored by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). Parties to ICERD undertake to guarantee the right of everyone to equality before the law and equality in the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion and expression. New Zealand laws that prohibit \\"blasphemous libel\\" and \\"denigration of religion\\" contravene international law, are discriminatory, and contravene New Zealand's obligations under both the ICCPR and ICERD. Repeal of the law In May 2017 an amendment to the omnibus Statutes Repeal Bill 2016 was tabled to repeal Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961, however, it was voted down by one vote on the basis that the matter should be considered separately from that bill in order to allow public submissions. On the 1 February 2018, a private member's bill, \\"Crimes (Offence of Blasphemous Libel) Amendment Bill\\", was introduced to parliament. This Bill was withdrawn on 21 March 2018 following the introduction of a government-sponsored Crimes amendment Bill on the 19 March which superseded it.Crimes (Offence of Blasphemous Libel) Amendment Bill, New Zealand Parliament. Retrieved 18 February 2018 On 19 March 2018, Justice Minister Andrew Little introduced a \\"Crimes Amendment Bill\\" to update the Crimes Act 1961. The bill would repeal three provisions of the Crimes Act 1961 considered to be out of date and not representing contemporary New Zealand attitudes, including repeal of Section 123. The bill passed the first reading on the 28 March and was referred to the Justice select committee. The select committee received submissions in support of repeal from the Ministry of Justice, the Human Rights Commission, the New Zealand Council of Civil Liberties, and other organisations and individuals, and opposing repeal from a small number of individuals. The committee reported back on the 28 September with the recommendation that repeal of Section 123 proceed without change. The Bill passed the second reading on the 11 December 2018, the Committee of the Whole House on the 20 February 2019, and the third reading on 5 March 2019 with the unanimous support of the House. It received the royal assent on the 11 March and came into force on the 12 March 2019 repealing Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961.

The dates of the tales range from 1787 to 1788. They were published in a collected edition for the first time in 1926 together with Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man (written in 1782).  History  Despite it having been written after de Sade's Les 120 journ√©es de Sodome ou l'√©cole du libertinage and Justine, the collection features little of the graphic display, elaborate torture and overall sadism that typically characterize de Sade's writing. The stories range from simple anecdotical tales with plot twists to clever softcore comedy and even some fantastic literature. Nevertheless, de Sade's trademark disdain for religion, morality and the French government remains, as does his sexually-themed narrative and devotion to nature as an excuse for the ways of the libertine.  Synopsis  The anthology is divided in two parts - Historiettes (consisting of 11 short stories) and Contes et Fabliaux (consisting of 14 short stories), as well as an appendice. Historiettes features all stories dealing with the fantastic (Le serpent, Le revenant and Aventure incompr√©hensible) as well as the shorter, anecdotical-like ones (Attrapez-moi toujours de m√™me, La Fleur de ch√¢taignier). Contes et Fabliaux features the more sadistic stories in the vein of de Sade's better known works. One in particular, Le Pr√©sident mystifi√© (\\"The Mystified Magistrate\\"), is the longest of the collection and due to its length and structure is sometimes considered a nouvelle of its own. The tale revolves around the title [gullible] magistrate, his upcoming marriage to a woman who (unbeknownst to him) does not desire him, and the series of practical jokes, hoaxes and elaborate schemes that the woman's brother-in-law (the marquis d'Olincourt) perpetrates against the magistrate in order to stop the wedding.

In the center and top left: Mar√≠a (Victoria Ruffo). At the bottom, from left to right: Carmela (Margarita Isabel), Servando (Lorenzo de Rodas), Alba (Jacqueline Andere), Esteban (C√©sar √âvora), Fabiola (Sabine Moussier), Bruno (Ren√© Casados), Daniela (Cecilia Gabriela), and Demetrio (Guillermo Garc√≠a Cant√∫). In the top right, clockwise from bottom: Leonel (Eduardo Capetillo), H√©ctor (Mauricio Aspe), Estrella (Ana Layevska), and √Ångel (Miguel √Ångel Biaggio). La Madrastra is a Mexican telenovela that aired on El Canal de las Estrellas in 2005. The program's main character is Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez Acu√±a, a woman who returns to Mexico after spending 20 years in prison for a murder she didn't commit only to find that her children believe that she is dead and that the picture of an unknown woman hanging above their fireplace is their mother. The telenovela follows Mar√≠a's attempts to regain her children's love without telling them who she really is, her complicated relationship with her ex-husband, Esteban, and her quest to find out which of her former friends really killed Patricia. Including Mar√≠a, the main cast consists of approximately twenty-five characters, as well as other recurring or minor characters. Main characters Mar√≠a Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez Acu√±a (Victoria Ruffo), the series protagonist, is wrongly sentenced to life in prison after her friend, Patricia, is murdered in Aruba. After twenty years, Mar√≠a is released for good behavior and returns to Mexico City to confront her husband and friends who abandoned her, and to reunite with her two children, H√©ctor and Estrella. Despite originally doubting her innocence, Mar√≠a rekindles her relationship with Esteban, and they remarry so that she can be closer to her children, whom she fears to tell that she is their mother until she has cleared her name. However, Mar√≠a's children resent her and consider her to be their wicked stepmother who is trying to usurp their mother's rightful place. After Mar√≠a's name is cleared, she and Esteban finally tell their children the truth, and Mar√≠a is reunited with her children as their mother at long last. The Suspects *Esteban San Rom√°n (C√©sar √âvora), an important and wealthy businessman, divorced Mar√≠a after she was convicted of Patricia's murder, told their young children that their mother had died in an accident, and erected a portrait of another woman above their mantle. He also adopts a third child, √Ångel, who is really the illegitimate son of his aunt Carmela, to avoid scandal. Despite the fact that he is engaged to Ana Rosa, Esteban quickly finds himself attracted to Mar√≠a once more and remarries her so that she can be closer to their children. After the discovery of a letter that incriminates him in Patricia's murder, an Aruban court finds him guilty of the crime and sentences him to death; he is saved literally minutes before his execution, and when he returns to Mexico he informs his children that Mar√≠a is their real mother. *Alba San Rom√°n (Jacqueline Andere), one of Esteban's aunts, and her sister Carmela raised Esteban following his parents' deaths. About twenty years ago, Alba had an affair with Demetrio, who was also sleeping with Carmela; subsequently, both women became pregnant, and when Alba's child was stillborn, she switched infants with her sister and then allowed Esteban to raise the child, √Ångel, to avoid scandal. Despite their blood relation, Alba harbors a forbidden love for Esteban and thus loathes all of the women who are in love with him, including Mar√≠a and Patricia. After being rejected by Esteban, Alba falsely accuses Esteban of murdering Patricia and then commits suicide by jumping from the roof of the San Rom√°n mansion. In the alternate ending, Alba frees Esteban from prison after she decides that she has to turn a new leaf, and after she is forgiven by all that she has harmed, she decides to leave Mexico for some time. *Bruno Mendiz√°bal (Ren√© Casados), an ambitious man with a penchant for eyeliner, is one of Esteban's business associates. He is husband of Fabiola, who married him out of convenience after Esteban rejected her. They had one son who was born with severe physical deformities as a result of their abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs; they subsequently abandoned him in a Canadian institution, only paying for his care. Patricia eventually came to learn this secret, thus providing him with motive for her murder. However, it is eventually revealed that Bruno was having a passionate affair with Patricia at the time of her death, and that she was pregnant with his child when she died. Two decades later, Bruno and Fabiola maintain a conspicuous, glamorous lifestyle. However, following their son's death, Bruno and Fabiola's marriage begins to deteriorate rapidly. In the original airing, the couple realize that they are in love and agree to become better people, with Bruno removing his trademark make-up and abandoning his obsession with his image. In the 2007 ending, Fabiola stabs Bruno to death in a fit of insanity after he discovers that she murdered Patricia. *Fabiola de Mendiz√°bal (Sabine Moussier), a haughty and arrogant woman, is married to Bruno, whom she wed after her fianc√© Esteban left her and married Mar√≠a. Twenty years ago, Fabiola gave birth to a son who suffered from extreme birth defects as a result of her and Bruno's wild lifestyle of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Horrified, the couple placed him in an institution in Canada; they never visited their child and swore to never speak of him again. Two decades later, Fabiola remains in love with Esteban and schemes to win him back. However, after her and Bruno's son dies, she becomes wracked with guilt. In the original 2005 airing, Fabiola leaves Bruno, only for the two to realize that they really do love one another; they reunite and pledge to become better people, leaving the glamorous personalities that they had created behind them. However, in the alternate airing, Fabiola is revealed to be Patricia's murderer, and she stabs Bruno to death in a fit of insanity after he learns of her guilt. After attacking Mar√≠a, Fabiola is placed in a mental institution. *Daniela de Rivero (Cecilia Gabriela), a fragile woman with a propensity to tears, is married to Demetrio, the corporate lawyer at the Empresas San Rom√°n. Demetrio was previously married to Daniela's sister, Sof√≠a, who was engulfed by madness after becoming addicted to pills. Daniela allowed her sister to overdose; after Sof√≠a's death, she married her former brother-in-law and took in Sof√≠a's daughter, Ana Rosa. Despite her emotional sensitivity, Daniela is an ambitious woman and encourages Ana Rosa's relationship with Esteban, despite the fact that she herself secretly harbors romantic feelings for Esteban. Daniela is devastated to learn that Demetrio fathered a child, √Ångel, with another woman and tries to save their marriage, but ultimately leaves Demetrio when she learns that he has been sexually abusing Ana Rosa since she was a young girl *Demetrio Rivero (Guillermo Garc√≠a Cant√∫) is a lawyer at the Empresas San Rom√°n, and is frequently regarded by many of the series' characters as a failure of a man. Much of Demetrio's assets are the result of his first marriage to his current wife Daniela's sister, Sof√≠a; Demetrio's investments and business deals frequently go awry, and as a result he embezzled a significant amount of money from the Empresas San Rom√°n about twenty years ago. In the original ending, it is revealed that Patricia discovered several of Demetrio's secrets: his embezzlement; his affairs with Alba and Carmela, the latter of which resulted in the birth of √Ångel; and the fact that he is a crossdresser. As a result, Demetrio murdered Patricia to keep his secrets safe. After Demetrio's crimes are revealed to the audience, he quickly spirals into insanity and is arrested after attempting to murder Bruno, Fabiola, Mar√≠a, and Esteban. In the 2007 ending, Demetrio reunites with √Ångel and Carmela as a family in the finale. *Carmela San Rom√°n (Margarita Isabel), one of Estaban's aunts, and her sister Alba raised their nephew following his parents' deaths. Carmela has always been weaker than Alba and is frequently manipulated into doing her bidding. Twenty years ago, Carmela had an affair with Demetrio, unaware that he was also sleeping with Alba; subsequently, both women became pregnant, and Carmela believed that her child died, while Esteban raised Alba's son, √Ångel. However, following a relapse of leukemia, Carmela learns that Alba switched infants, and that √Ångel is really her son. Carmela happily reunites with her son and renounces her sister. *Servando Maldonado (Lorenzo de Rodas) is the miserly business associate of Esteban who falsely provided testimony against Mar√≠a in Patricia's murder trial twenty years ago because he was in love with Mar√≠a and hated her for not reciprocating his emotions. After learning that he is dying, Servando hides numerous letters confessing the true murderer's identity and arranges to divide his considerable fortune between his mute maid, Venturina, and the stepbrother he had abused as a child, Rufino \\" El Pulpo\\" S√°nchez. Servando is smothered to death by an off-screen Demetrio, who fears that he will reveal his identity, but the other characters assume that he died of natural causes. After his death, one of Servando's letters is discovered and implicates Esteban in Patricia's murder as a means of hurting Mar√≠a yet again; it is turned over to the police, and as a result Esteban is extradited to Aruba, where he is tried for Patricia's murder. In the alternate ending, Servando dies of natural causes. The youth *Leonel Ib√°√±ez (Eduardo Capetillo) is the son of Patricia and Arturo who was orphaned at a young age after his mother was murdered and his father subsequently died of a broken heart. Esteban took the young boy under his wing, telling him that his mother had died in an accident. Leonel falls in love with Mar√≠a when she returns to Mexico, unaware that she has spent the last twenty years in prison for his mother's murder. After Mar√≠a remarries Esteban, Leonel eventually reciprocates his secretary Lupita's feelings, and they are married in the finale. *Ana Rosa M√°rquez (Martha Julia) is the twenty-something fianc√©e of Esteban who was raised by her aunt Daniela following the death of her mother, Sof√≠a; both Sof√≠a and Daniela have been married to Demetrio, who has sexually abused Ana Rosa since she was a young girl due to her resemblance to her deceased mother (also portrayed by Julia). Ana Rosa and Daniela scheme together to secure Ana Rosa's marriage to the wealthy Esteban, despite the fact that Ana Rosa continues a relationship with the social-climbing Carlos. Ana Rosa shows signs of being afflicted by the same madness that claimed her mother and shoots Esteban in an attempt to murder Mar√≠a, but after a stint in a psychiatric clinic Ana Rosa turns over a new leaf and attempts to become a better person. She discovers a videocassette revealing Patricia's murderer and attempts to turn it over to the Aruban authorities, but she is lured to an abandoned warehouse and murdered by Demetrio before she can expose him. In the alternate ending, Ana Rosa has a happy ending and is in a committed relationship with Dr. Ruiz. *H√©ctor San Rom√°n (Mauricio Aspe) is the son of Mar√≠a and Esteban. An executive at his father's company, H√©ctor becomes determined to prove his independence from his father when Esteban becomes engaged to Ana Rosa, and again when Esteban marries Mar√≠a, because he loathes the idea of a stepmother. H√©ctor briefly warms to Mar√≠a when she pays off his debt from a business transaction gone wrong, but he eventually turns against her once more after Alba accuses Mar√≠a of assault. H√©ctor marries Vivian, Mar√≠a's former cellmate, when she becomes pregnant, but remains concerned that she is having an affair with Greco and thus begins an affair with Ang√©lica during his wedding reception and begins drinking heavily.

In the first version of the novela, Patricia is murdered by Demetrio after she threatens to reveal that he is a cross-dresser, that he had affairs with Alba and Carmela that resulted in both women becoming pregnant, and that he embezzled money from the Empresas San Rom√°n. In the second version, Fabiola murders Patricia in order to rid herself of a rival for Esteban's affection and because Patricia threatens to reveal the existence of the deformed baby that Fabiola and Bruno abandoned in a Canadian institution. *Rebeca Robles (Liza Willert) is the San Rom√°ns' maid and Alba's frequent accomplice in her attempts to undermine Mar√≠a's position as the lady of the house. Towards the end of the series, she tries to blackmail Alba in to giving her a large sum of money in exchange for helping her to lock up all of the mansion's inhabitants, and Alba, in response, poisons Rebeca's wine with rat poison, subsequently killing the maid in graphic and gruesome fashion. In the alternate ending, Rebeca quits working for the San Romans after she is fed up with Alba's bitterness, which influences Alba to turn over a new leaf and become a better person. *Luciano Cerezuela (Archy Lanfranco) Luciano is Mar√≠a's lawyer who worked tirelessly for twenty years to free his client from prison. During that time, Luciano came to love Mar√≠a, but Mar√≠a claimed to be unable to love romantically after her incarceration.

Alba also convinces Ang√©lica to seduce a tormented H√©ctor at his and Vivian's wedding reception. *Maggy (St√©phanie G√©rard) is Estrella's best friend and confidant. She develops a crush on Estrella's younger brother, √Ångel, and drives him to a secluded location in hopes of seducing him; however, when he spurns her advances, she drives away, leaving him abandoned in the middle of nowhere and effectively ending any chance of a relationship between the two, despite her subsequent regrets.

Early life Schuyler was born in Ithaca, New York, on August 19, 1843. He was the son of Eleanor (n√©e Johnson) Schuyler (1818‚Äì1849) and the Rev. Dr. Anthony Schuyler (1816‚Äì1900), one time rector of the Protestant Episcopal Church Grace Church in Orange, New Jersey, which is now known as the Church of the Epiphany. His siblings included Eleanor Schuyler (d. 1850), Ben Johnson Schuyler (d. 1854), Charles Brother Schuyler (1841‚Äì1929). After his mother's death, his father remarried to Mary Hall Allen in 1860, with whom his father had another daughter and two sons, Montgomery's half-siblings, Rev. Hamilton Schuyler and Anthony Schuyler, Jr. His paternal grandparents were Alborn Schuyler (b. 1788) and Caroline (n√©e Butler) Schuyler. The Schuylers were one of the oldest families in New York, descendants of Philip Pieterse Schuyler, who settled in Beverwyck (now Albany, New York) in 1650, through his son Arent Schuyler (1662‚Äì1730) and his son Casparus Schuyler (1695‚Äì1754). His maternal grandparents were Ben Johnson (1783‚Äì1848) and Jane (n√©e Dey) Johnson (1798‚Äì1881). Schuyler entered Hobart College in 1858 but failed to graduate. He became a member of the Sigma Phi Society. Professional career In 1865, at the end of the American Civil War, Schuyler came to New York and worked as an editorial writer on The World before leaving to join the editorial staff of The New York Times in 1883. He worked as an editorial writer for The New York Times for twenty-four years. During his time at The Times, he wrote many articles, including articles about the architecture of Washington, D.C., about the 3,000 miles between New York and California, about the work of William Wordsworth, the work of Russell Sturgis, and the work of Henry James. In the 1870s, Schuyler supported Frederick Law Olmsted, a friend, H. H. Richardson, whom he admired, and Leopold Eidlitz in the controversy surrounding the completion of the New York State Capitol buildings. In 1882, Schuyler, who lived at the end of East 84th Street in Manhattan, proposed building a residential development project between East 81st Street and East 84th Street, along the East River just south of the East River Park (now known as the Carl Schurz Park). In 1883, Schuyler wrote upon the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York: > \\"It so happens that the work which is likely to be our most durable > monument, and to convey some knowledge of us to the most remote posterity, > is a work of bare utility; not a shrine, not a fortress, not a palace, but a > bridge.\\" Quoted in David P. Billington, The Tower and the Bridge: The New > Art of Structural Engineering (1983), p.17 From 1885‚Äì1887, he was managing editor of Harper's Weekly, and from 1887 to 1894, was connected with the publishing department of Harper & Bros., serving both in an editorial capacity and as a writer. In the last few years of his career, Schuyler was a contributor to The Sun, and also wrote for many magazines and periodicals, particularly on the subject of architecture, in which he specialized. He was a staunch advocate of the modern skyscraper, who believed that it was \\"a legitimate architectural expression of our times.\\" In 1892, he published his seminal work, American Architecture Studies published by Harper & Brothers Publishers. In the book, similarly to Louis Sullivan's feelings in his 1892 book, Ornament in Architecture, he stated: \\"If you were to scrape down to the face of the main wall of the buildings of these streets, you would find that you had simply removed all the architecture, and that you had left the buildings as good as ever.\\" Later life He retired from the New York Times in 1907 and moved to New Rochelle, New York, \\"taking an active interest in local affairs, acting in an advisory capacity on questions of beautifying the city and the artistic and harmonious architectural development of the town.\\" Schuyler was a member of the American Institute of Architects, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the Century Club. Personal life In 1876, he married Katherine Beeckman Livingston (1842‚Äì1914). Their families were previously connected as Schuyler's seven times great-aunt had married Katherine's ancestor, Robert Livingston, first Lord of the manor of Livingston (also ancestor of both Presidents Bush and Eleanor Roosevelt) in Albany in 1679. Together, Montgomery and Katherine were the parents of: * Montgomery Schuyler, Jr. (1877-1955), who was secretary to the U.S. legation in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1902, U.S. Consul General in Bangkok, U.S. Minister to Ecuador, U.S. Minister to El Salvador. * Robert Livingston Schuyler (1883‚Äì1966), who served as President of the American Historical Association. Schuyler's wife died on July 7, 1914. Schuyler died of pneumonia shortly thereafter at his home at 250 Winyah Avenue, New Rochelle, New York, on July 16, 1914. He was buried alongside his wife at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Published works * Westward the Course of Empire * Studies in American Architecture * The Brooklyn Bridge (with W. C.

Purpose The dam was constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers for commercial navigation purposes to serve the city of Augusta, located approximately upstream. It does not serve a hydroelectric power generation or flood control function. New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam Project; Savannah River Georgia and South Carolina; Section 216; Disposition Study; Final Report; September 8, 2000 History Located at river mile 187.4, the lock and dam was authorized by the 1930 and 1935 Rivers and Harbors Acts to facilitate commercial navigation on the upper reaches of the Savannah River. The structure was completed in 1937. The last commercial shipping to use the lock ceased in 1979 and the structure and upstream channel fell into disuse. In 1999 the Corps of Engineers proposed demolishing and removing the dam, but local outcry over the resulting impact to users of the impounded pool resulted in the United States Congress declaring in 2000 that the dam would be repaired and then turned over to a local government to be maintained, however the work never received funding. Pavey, Rob. Stimulus bill could aid dam; Augusta Chronicle; January 22, 2009 The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (the WIIN Act), deauthorized the lock and dam and directed the Army Corps to construct fish passage across the existing dam while maintaining the impoundment of water. The deepening of the Savannah River to allow Neopanamax- sized ships reach the Port of Savannah caused saltwater to damage spawning grounds of the endangered shortnose sturgeon near the mouth of the river. Allowing fish passage upriver of the New Savannah Bluff dam to historic spawning grounds was identified as a mitigation to this damage. , the Army Corps presented five alternatives to allow fish passage and expects to select a plan in 2019 and begin construction in 2021. Current uses The dam serves water supply users including one municipality, five industries, and one sod farm; water-related recreation opportunities such as general boating and fishing and specialized rowing and powerboat race events; and regional economic development and tourism. It is also operated to pass some migratory anadromous fish species. The upstream pool extends through downtown Augusta to near the I-20 bridges. Structure This project consists of a lock chamber, dam, operation building, and a park and recreation area. The dam is long with five vertical lift gates. Each gate is long and located between concrete piers. The two gates on each end of the dam are high, overflow type. The three middle gates are high, non-overflow type. All are remotely controlled from the J. Strom Thurmond project. The lock is on the Georgia side of the river adjacent to the dam. The lock‚Äôs usable chamber is wide and long and the lift height is approximately . Construction of this concrete gravity structure supported by timber piles was completed in 1937.

Girls! Girls! is the fifth soundtrack album by American singer and musician Elvis Presley, released on RCA Victor Records in mono and stereo, LPM/LSP 2426, in November 1962. It accompanied the 1962 film of the same name starring Presley. Recording sessions took place at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on March 26, 27, and 28, and May 23, 1962. It peaked at number three on the Top LP's chart. It was certified Gold on August 13, 1963 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Note: Enter advanced search for \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" Content As soundtrack album sales far outstripped his regular album sales (Blue Hawaii outselling Pot Luck with Elvis by ten to one) Presley found himself firmly entrenched in songs designed for a light- entertainment formula of beautiful scenery and girls galore.Jorgensen, Ernst. Elvis Presley A Life in Music: The Complete Recording Sessions. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998; pp. 164-165, 172. With this discrepancy in sales, the formula of the soundtrack music became the focus. This formula for success would prove disastrous for Presley's career. Popular music was on the threshold of complete renewal and change and Presley would become 'lost in Hallywood'. Sixteen songs were recorded at the sessions in March, of which thirteen were used for the soundtrack album.Jorgensen, op. cit., pp. 169-170. Banished from the kingdom after running afoul of the Colonel, songs from favored writers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller could only be those already written for someone else, in this case the title track being a hit for The Coasters in 1961 before being adapted for the Presley film.Jorgensen, op. cit., p. 173. The tracks \\"Return to Sender\\" and \\"Where Do You Come From\\" were issued as both sides of a single in October 1962, one month before the release of the soundtrack LP. \\"Return to Sender\\" became a substantial hit for Presley, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the b-side \\"Where Do You Come From\\" peaked at only number 99 independently of the hit side.Jorgensen, op. cit., p. 415. The songs performed by Stella Stevens in the film -- \\"Never Let Me Go\\", \\"The Nearness Of You\\" and \\"Baby, Baby, Baby\\" -- were in fact mimed to the singing voice of Gilda Maiken and have yet to be commercially released.Kid Galahad / Girls!

Being one of his most famous works, the quintet is famous for its minuet third movement (often referred to as \\"The Celebrated Minuet\\") which is most-often played as a standalone piece outside of the context of the full quintet.de Guin, Elisabeth, \\"Boccherini's body: an essay in carnal musicology\\", p. 157, 2006, University of California Press, Berkeley, Background This string quintet is a \\"cello quintet\\" in that it is scored for a string quartet (two violins, viola, cello) with a second cello as the fifth instrument. At the time of this composition, Boccherini had been writing string quartets for about ten years. In 1771, Boccherini's patron Don Luis, the brother of King Charles III of Spain, began to employ the Font String Quartet, composed of violist Francisco Font and his three sons. The Font String Quartet performed many of Boccherini‚Äôs works, and for a while Boccherini wrote almost exclusively for them.Rothschild, Germaine de, \\"Luigi Boccherini: His Life and Work\\", p. 37, 1965, Oxford UP, London He also occasionally joined the quartet as a performer himself, which prompted him to add an additional cello part to his music.Heartz, Daniel, \\"Music in European Capitals: The Galant Style, 1720‚Äì1780\\", p. 984, 2003, Norton, New York, Boccherini‚Äôs first set of string quintets, his Op. 10, were also composed in 1771.Heartz, Daniel, \\"Music in European Capitals: The Galant Style, 1720‚Äì1780\\", p. 980, 2003, Norton, New York, His second set, Op. 11, consisted of six quintets, most notably No. 5 in E Major. This became Boccherini‚Äôs most famous work even though, when published, it received no special recognition.G√©rard, Yves, \\"Thematic, Bibliographical, and Critical Catalogue of the Works of Luigi Boccherini\\", p. 306, 1969, Oxford UP, London Structure The quintet has four movements: #Amoroso #Allegro e con spirito #Minuetto, Trio (A major) #Rondeau, andante Minuet The third movement of the quintet is notably the most famous, and is the most often performed of all the movements. It is in 3/4 time, and is occasionally referred to as the ‚ÄúCelebrated Minuet‚Äù. It departs from the original key of E Major and becomes A Major. In the beginning of the movement, the first violin plays a simple, elegant melody, while the viola and celli have eighth note pizzicato. The second violin, on the other hand, has quick sixteenth note slurs which contain many string crossings. As Elisabeth Le Guin puts it in Boccherini‚Äôs Body: An Essay in Carnal Musicology, ‚ÄúThe second violinist has no time for galanterie; he must concentrate on keeping the constant string crossings reasonable even through the length of the bow‚Äù. Arrangements The arrangements of this quintet, especially of the minuet, are extremely numerous. The entire piece was arranged for a double viola quintet in the 18th century. A 19th century transcription of the minuet for the organ can be found in the Biblioth√®que Inguimbertine in Carpentras. There are countless modern transcriptions of the minuet, including those for the piano, saxophone, two mandolins, accordion, choir, and full orchestra. Other uses The minuet has been used extensively in popular media including movies, television and video games. It has often been used to depict late 18th / early 19th century society in the United States, most especially during the Revolutionary War. It was most notably used in The Time of Their Lives (1946), the British black comedy The Ladykillers (1955) with Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers, and as the music box music in Two Rode Together. It was also used in The Magnificent Ambersons (1942). It was quoted by fictional rock guitarist Nigel Tufnel (portrayed by Christopher Guest) in the closing measures of the song \\"Heavy Duty\\" in the motion picture This is Spinal Tap (1984), spoofing the classical pretensions of heavy metal groups. The British children's television programme ZZZap! used the movement in the sketches featuring Neil Buchanan's \\"Smart Arty\\" character. In the late 1960s, the pioneering predecessor of Minnesota Public Radio used the opening section as the intro to its evening classical program. It is used by Bryan Bishop as a \\"drop\\" on the Adam Carolla podcast. Arrangements of the minuet are also used in the Suzuki Method.

All of these variable plans have been executed based on comprehensive planning. According to a census conducted in February 1999, 304 master plans (including national, regional, urban, and new-cities plans) had been approved; that figure has climbed to 350 plans. The industrial revolution was considered as a turning point for great changes in cities but this change belongs mostly to western cities that existed prior to the 20th century. The fast development and prosperity of urban planning discussed here refers to the first years of 20th century. Approaches to urban planning In recent years, exacerbation of urban problems has formed two views on urban planning Iran. Comprehensive and rational This approach asserts that there are not suitable conditions and enough infrastructure to use acceptable new tools in urban planning and states that planners have to follow their traditional way in urban plans. Strategic and structural Thinkers of this approach believe that qualitative changes during the time, insufficient pattern in urban development plans to cater for the demands of society, globalization, and the necessity of adapting to changes with urban plans, necessitate the use of a new pattern in society. It recognizes the limitations and problems in these plans in the context of Iran and offers a systematic approach as a transition tool from comprehensive approach to strategic approach in the urban planning system. Master development plans This pattern was formed by Patrick Geddes, who established urban planning, and his student Lewis Mumford. They were biologists who could use the methods of ecology and biology to discuss organic theory in urban planning. Master development plans have been created by combining this theory with new urban functionalism theory over half a century. Systematic approach in urban planning Twenty-five years experience of urban planning after the war demonstrated the difficulties of a master plan in Europe. Along with these problems there was increasingly critical opinion about the fundamental theory. During the 1960s and 1970s, theories and experience of urban planning in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, and Japan led to a systematic approach. Final goals of the systematic approach are: # Far from master and rational plans # Follow economic, social, and cultural goals # Combine planning and management # Completion of approaches and methods in urban planning in framework plans Strategic approach in urban planning Specifications of strategic- structural plans shows they are better than comprehensive plans. The most important specifics of these plans are: # Cyclical process of preparation of these plans # Flexibility and envisaging probable failures and the possibility of reviewing the perspective, general objectives, and strategies # Possibility of participation of people in preparation, approval, implementation, and review of these plans Iranian managers are supporting comprehensive plans despite the fact that such plans were proven outdated in other countries over four decades ago. Support extended by Iranian officials to comprehensive plans is the main challenge facing strategic-structural ones. The high capacity of strategic-structural plans to adapt to complicated and changeable social and economic conditions has been proven. But implementation of these plans needs at least a basic foundation in science, theory, economics, law, finance, and administration. Until such preconditions materialize, implementation of a plan with a strategic stance is impossible.  References  Housing and Urbanism Ministry, urbanism, and architecture regulations, Tehran. J.

It is 52 km far from the east of Bursa and Bursa city center. Bursa's international airport is within the borders of Yeni≈üehir. For this reason, the Airport is called 'Yeni≈üehir Airport'. County economics is agricultural and livestock based. Although founded by the municipality in 2004, the YOIZ (Yeni≈üehir Organized Industrial Zone) began the industrialization boom. It is the number one district of Bursa, especially in the export of agricultural products. Tomato and pepper cultivation is world famous. The region has a mild Marmara climate. It is located close to ƒ∞neg√∂l and ƒ∞znik. Some of the people of Yeni≈üehir go to Bursa and ƒ∞neg√∂l to work. Yeni≈üehir is neighbor to Kestel in the west, ƒ∞neg√∂l in the south, ƒ∞znik in the north, Orhangazi in the north-west and Bilecik in the east. The total population of the district is around 52,200.  History  Yeni≈üehir, which was established by building permanent houses for the first time from the tent life in the Beylik period of the Ottoman Empire, was used by the Ottoman Army in Anatolia and Middle East expeditions due to its wetland and wide plain. The city was founded by Osman Gazi,where for the first time, a sermon was read, coins were printed, taxes were collected, a regular army was started to be established, and the first law (edict) was commanded here. Then the city was the capital for a short time (29 years) (although S√∂ƒü√ºt is also claimed to be the capital) and the city handed over the duty as capital with the acquisition of Bursa. The district is one of the developing districts of Bursa province. The known history of Yeni≈üehir dates back to the beginning of the 14th century. It was connected to the Ertuƒürul sanjak, where Bilecik was the center at that time, and continued this position until 1926. ƒ∞znik was the subdistrict of the city between 1926 and 1930. After the capture of K√∂pr√ºhisar and Yarhisar in the years when the Ottoman Empire became a state, Osman Bey gave this region to his veterans as a sword right. Yeni≈üehir became known with this name for the first time since it was opened for construction. In the book \\"Ottoman History\\", written by ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Uzun√ßar≈üƒ±lƒ±, the phrase \\"A Turkish city was established in the plain and a headquarters was built because it was close to the battlefield\\". In the light of this information, it is understood that Yeni≈üehir was established as a Turkish city and opened to residence. Yeni≈üehir, a 680-year-old Turkish city, was occupied by the Greeks during the Turkish War of Independence/Greco-Turkish War between October 27, 1920 and September 6, 1922, and on September 6, 1922, the city was liberated from the occupation. The establishment of the villages goes back to old times, for example, the Yarhisar neighborhood is known to have Tekfur barracks during the Byzantine period. Likewise, Akbƒ±yƒ±k and S√ºleymaniye villages have remained from the Byzantine period (castle). The Ottomans built many historical monuments in the city. 10 of the 17 mosques in the district center belong to the Ottoman period. Some of the mosques and baths built in villages were built during the Ottoman period. Other historical monuments in the district are Babasultan Lodge, Sinanpa≈üa Mosque and Caravansary, √áiftehamamlar, S√ºleymanpa≈üa Mosque and Mausoleum, Palace Bath, Shemaki House. While describing the history of Yeni≈üehir, it made it easier to tell that Osman Ghazi, the founder of the Ottoman Empire, spent his childhood in the Yarhisar neighborhood, and won great victories against the Byzantines in the Koyunhisar plain. The Ottomans also went to the west in several wars. In these wars, Osman Bey's brother Aydoƒüdu Bey was martyred. His grave is still in Koyunhisar neighborhood.  Culture and tourism  The district, which is located 52 km east of Bursa and joined the Ottoman territory in the period of Osman Gazi, was granted to the veterans by Osman Gazi under the name of sword right. The city, which was established at the location opened to living, was named Yeni≈üehir. It has rich historical artifacts from the Ottoman period. The Palace Bath, which was left behind from the palace built by Osman Gazi in Yeni≈üehir, is the Postinpu≈ü Baba Lodge from the period of Murad I. Voyvoda Mosque (√áƒ±narlƒ± Mosque), built in the 14th century, Koca Sinan Pasha Complex, Bali Bey Mosque, built in the 16th century. Ulu Mosque, S√ºleyman Pasha Complex, built by Orhan Bey, Double Bath, built by H√ºseyin Pasha of Yeni≈üehir in 1645, Yarhisar Village Orhan Mosque and Clock Tower are historical buildings worth seeing. In addition, there are historical tumuluses in Barcƒ±n Neighborhood of Yeni≈üehir.  Economic structure  The main income source of the district is agriculture. 78.7% of the total population lives on agriculture. All villages provide their livelihood with agricultural production, and 10,789 people of the district center's population also provide their livelihood with agricultural production. Industrialization in the district, where agriculture can be made in approximately 65% of its land, has started to develop. In 2004 and in the total area of 173.5 hectares in the Organized Industrial Zone, by Turkey Glass Bottle Factories, Anatolia Glass Yeni≈üehir Inc. and Thrace Glass Yeni≈üehir Inc., two factories operating in the field of glass packaging and flat glass were established. The total number of workers working in both factories is 1,064. In addition, there are 2 vegetable oil factories, 3 flour factories, 1 dairy factory, 3 dairy workshops and 1 auto spare parts mold production factory. 343 people are employed in these facilities.  Yeni≈üehir Shemaki House Museum  It was built in the 18th century by the Shemaki family who came to Anatolia from Shemakh town of Iran and settled in Yeni≈üehir. On the ground floor of the two-story house there is a stony kitchen and a cellar to the right and two winter rooms to the left. You can go upstairs with wooden stairs adjacent to the kitchen wall. Facing the garden, the front facade opens to the outside with arched sections in the form of porticoes. There is a big room opening to the sofa with iwan on the left and two rooms, one on the right and one on the small. Pen works with ornamental motifs and landscape decorations adorning the house from the 19th century. There is no bathhouse part that is said to be located in the garden today. Yeni≈üehir Shemaki House Museum is open to visitors every day except Monday.  Transportation   Road transport  Yeni≈üehir is 25 km from ƒ∞znik district in the north, 27 km from ƒ∞neg√∂l district in the south, 45 km from Bilecik province in the east and 52 km from Bursa province in the west. There are scheduled bus services to Yeni≈üehir from all four cities.  Airline transportation  At Bursa Yeni≈üehir Airport, scheduled civil flight services and cargo transportation can be made.  Media  Visual media service was provided for a period under the name of Yeni≈üehir TV (Y√∂rem TV). There was also a radio publishing house broadcasting on the FM band called Radio Sƒ±rda≈ü locally. Today, there is no active radio and television channel in the district.

Treales The name of the village is given as \\"Treueles\\" in the Domesday Book and as \\"Turuel\\" in 1242. In 1066 Treales was a member the fee of Earl Tostig and was assessed as two plough- lands. It was later a member of the Weeton fee and was held successively by Boteler and Stanley, and the lordship then descended to the Earl of Derby. In 1228‚Äì29 a mandate was issued to the sheriff in respect of a Lewe de Treales, who had found ancient coins while ploughing. In 1637 Sir Edward Osbaldeston had a small rent from Treales. In 1717 some \\"Papists\\" of Treales and Roseacre registered estates. In Treales the Anglican parish church, Christ Church, is situated on Church Road. It was built 1855 by Lord Stanley, when the Patron was the vicar of Kirkham. The church is now part of a benefice with Christ Church, Wesham.

Many species are known generally as twinpods, bladderpods, or lesquerella. They are native to the Americas, with many species endemic to western North America. They are densely hairy annual and perennial herbs often growing prostrate or decumbent, along the ground in patches or clumps. They bear inflorescences of bright yellow flowers. The fruit is often notched deeply, dividing into twin sections, giving the genus its common name. Bladderpod oil is extracted from the seeds of Physaria fendleri and certain other species in the genus.

Since releasing their debut album \\"Candice Recorder\\" in 2001, the band has toured the US with Low. If Thousands' music has been featured on NPR. Christian McShane also performed with Charlie Parr in the band Devil's Flying Machine. Aaron Molina was previously part of the rock band Small Engine City. Nathan Amundson of Rivulets performed on their album Yellowstone. In a Dreamland Recordings interview McShane explained the purpose and origin If Thousands, \\"The idea that we started with was to relax people. To relax them to a point where they are drooling.'' Elegy, a 25-hour drone in honor of artist Michael Lenz, encouraged cathartic release through unyielding drone. If Thousands' ethic of relaxation found similar form in Slumber, a performance where audience members were encouraged to bring pillows and blankets for the purposes of sleep. Molina had been in mostly punk bands and was looking for something new. McShane was a classically trained vocalist who was in multiple local bands, as well as forming \\"Experimental Tuesdays\\", with Low's Alan Sparhawk - a local event at the Norshor theatre in Duluth, MN in which performers would be encouraged to exhibit experimental works of music, film, dance, or visual art. If Thousands' foundation rests primarily on electric guitar and the drone of a Hammond M3 organ, which was the only keyboard McShane could afford when they first began. His only other keyboard was a MicroMoog synthesizer he found discarded in a snow bank in the middle of the Superior National Forest (Superior, Wisconsin). In order to transport the large, heavy Hammond M3 organ to early performances, they cut it in half and McShane would reassemble it onstage before the performance took place. In one such instance, McShane actually electrocuted himself, but was fine after being revived. In 2013, they reformed to record an album, entitled \\"For,\\" and have been active as recently as January 2018, releasing two singles and performing at the fifth annual Drone Not Drones event in Minneapolis.

The skipper was first discovered in 1978 and the paper describing it as a full species was published in 2015.Burns 2015  Distribution  The crystal skipper is endemic to Bogue Banks and Bear Island in North Carolina, USA. Bogue Banks is approximately 25 miles long and Bear Island is about 3.5 miles long. The skipper is also found on several human-made dredge spoil islands within the vicinity of these two natural barrier islands.Leidner 2009 Bear Island, part of Hammocks Beach State Park, is completely undeveloped and has the largest skipper population. The second largest population is at Fort Macon State Park, on the eastern end of Bogue Banks. The remaining populations are smaller and scattered between these two state parks.Leidner 2009  Taxonomy and common name  Burns described Atrytonopsis quinteri as a full species, and details differences in anatomy with related species A. hianna, A. vierecki, A. lunus, A. pittacus, A. python, A. margarita, and A. cestus.Burns 2015 The species was believed to be either 1) a full species in the genus Atrytonopsis, 2) a subspecies of A. hianna (the dusted skipper), 3) a subspecies of A. loammi (which some consider to be a subspecies of A. hianna), or 4) the same species as A. loammi. Field guides and checklists often group Atrytonopsis new species 1 with A. loammi. How A. quinteri differs from the very similar A. loammi of coastal Florida is unclear, as Burns does not discuss differences with that species.Burns 2015 A formal common name has not been given for this species, but the most frequently used one is the crystal skipper. It is called the crystal skipper because it is native to the section of the North Carolina called the Crystal Coast and because it has white spots on its wings that look like crystals.  Life cycle  The crystal skipper has two broods per year. The first brood emerges from the chrysalis stage from mid-April to mid-May. Adults from this brood mate and the females then lay eggs. The eggs hatch into caterpillars, which feed, grow and then undergo pupation to form a chrysalis. After metamorphosis, the second brood adults emerge between mid-July and mid-August. The caterpillars from this brood will grow until fall and then overwinter. The following spring they complete metamorphosis and the cycle repeats. Therefore, the adults in the spring of the second year are the grandchildren of the brood from the previous spring. The crystal skipper lays its eggs on seaside little bluestem, Schizachyrium littorale, and the caterpillars feed on this grass.  Habitat  The crystal skipper is found along primary and secondary sand dunes where its hostplant, seaside little bluestem (Schizachyrium littorale), is present. Although the largest and most dense populations of the skipper are usually on undisturbed sand dunes, the skipper can also persist in small patches of sand dune habitat, such as undeveloped lots in urban areas. Additionally, the crystal skipper is found on several human-made dredge spoil islands that have been colonized by seaside little bluestem.  Conservation status  The crystal skipper is globally rare but locally abundant. Much of the sand dunes on Bogue Banks have been destroyed by development, leaving little habitat for the crystal skipper outside the two state parks. The crystal skipper is a federal species of concern. A ‚Äúspecies of concern‚Äù is an informal designation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and is not a term that is defined under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The crystal skipper is not federally listed as threatened or endangered. Insects cannot be listed under the North Carolina Endangered Species Act.  Conservation and Restoration  Crystal skippers rely on flowers for nectar and seaside little bluestem for hostplants. Retaining native vegetation in your yard, especially dune grasses such as seaside little bluestem, can help create habitat for the crystal skipper and other native animals. Alternately, you could try actively planting seaside little bluestem. Native flowers that are commonly used for sources of nectar during the spring crystal skipper brood include: Yellow thistle (Cirsium horridulum), risky tread-softly or spurge nettle (Cnidoscolus stimulosus), southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis), and coastal prickly pear (Opuntia pusilla). The summer brood of crystal skippers frequent morning glory (Ipomoea spp), especially in the morning. Non-native plants (also called exotic plants) that are a common source of nectar include Lantana species.  References  Burns, J. 2000.

Early life and education Born in Hackettstown, New Jersey, on April 23, 1862, Heed began his musical career with the Hackettstown Cornet Band by the age of 11. By the time he reached the age of 17 he was the leader of this band and he had mastered with astonishing rapidity the intricacies of harmony and counterpoint. He became proficient on the piano and violin, and could play most band instruments. Career In 1882 Heed had the opportunity to travel with a noted English orchestra through the United States. The cornetist that had come with the orchestra became ill and was sent back to England. Heed was highly recommended and was engaged to fill the cornetist's place. He received encomiums from the press and public in every city and town visited. A year later, in 1883, Heed accepted an engagement to become the leader of the Providence Brigade Band. This was a position that he held until he was called back to New Jersey to conduct another orchestra and band. Soon thereafter, he went to Worcester, Massachusetts and spent eight years as a teacher of bands. His next position was a cornetist for Voss's First Regiment Band in Newark, New Jersey. It was after the Metronome article was written that Mr. Heed went with John Phillip Sousa's band as a soloist and arranger before contracting tuberculosis in the 1890s and dying in Newark, New Jersey on February 12, 1908. He died leaving no children. He was buried near his family in Union Cemetery in Hackettstown, New Jersey. According to local legend in Hackettstown, New Jersey it is claimed that it was Heed who actually wrote for Sousa his great masterpiece: \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". This is corroborated by a story entitled \\"Hackettstown's Early Musicians\\" in the book entitled \\"The Story of Hackettstown New Jersey from 1754 to 1955\\" by J. Harold Nunn at pages 99‚Äì101. His original cornet along with various photographs may be seen at the Hackettstown Historical Society Museum, in Hackettstown, New Jersey where the cornet is on loan from Mr. Heed's family. Heed's best known works include the marches In Storm and Sunshine, Regimental Pride, Metronome Prize, Clipper, The Rouser, and General Miles. He also composed polkas, waltzes, orchestral works, and pieces for cornet and piano. He is occasionally referred to as the \\"March Wizard\\" by Carl Fischer, one of America's oldest music houses and who published Mr. Heed's compositions.

In the center there is a wall like structure, which probably are the walls of Benin. The Walls of Benin are a series of earthworks made up of banks and ditches, called ya in the Edo language, in the area around present-day Benin City, the capital of present-day Edo, Nigeria. They consist of of city iya and an estimated of rural iya in the area around Benin. The 'walls' of Benin City and surrounding areas were described as \\"the world's largest earthworks carried out prior to the mechanical era\\" by the Guinness book of Records. Some estimates suggest that the walls of Benin may have been constructed between the thirteenth and mid-fifteenth century CE and others suggest that the walls of Benin (in the Esan region) may have been constructed during the first millennium CE. History  First Encounters and Records  The Benin City walls have been known to Westerners since around 1500. Around 1500, the Portuguese explorer Duarte Pacheco Pereira, briefly described the walls during his travels. Another description given around 1600, one hundred years after Pereira's description, is by the Dutch explorer Dierick Ruiters. Pereira's account of the walls is as follows: The archaeologist Graham Connah suggests that Pereira was mistaken with his description by saying that there was no wall. Connah says, \\"[Pereira] considered that a bank of earth was not a wall in the sense of the Europe of his day.\\" Ruiters' account of the walls is as follows:  Construction  Estimates for the initial construction of the walls range from the first millennium CE to the mid-fifteenth century CE. According to Connah, oral tradition and travelers' accounts suggest a construction date of 1450-1500 CE. It has been estimated that, assuming a 10-hour work day, a labour force of 5,000 men could have completed the walls within 97 days, or by 2,421 men in 200 days. However, these estimates have been criticized for not taking into account the time it would have taken to extract earth from an ever deepening hole and the time it would have taken to heap the earth into a high bank. Description Benin in 1897 The walls were built of a ditch and dike structure; the ditch dug to form an inner moat with the excavated earth used to form the exterior rampart. The Benin Walls were ravaged by the British in 1897 during what has come to be called the Punitive expedition. Scattered pieces of the structure remain in Edo, with the vast majority of them being used by the locals for building purposes. What remains of the wall itself continues to be torn down for real estate developments.http://www.beninmoatfoundation.org/clarioncall.html Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist: Ethnomathematician Ron Eglash has discussed the planned layout of the city using fractals as the basis, not only in the city itself and the villages but even in the rooms of houses. He commented that \\"When Europeans first came to Africa, they considered the architecture very disorganised and thus primitive.

As such, the pathway is suitable for walking and pushbikes, as well as wheelchairs. Louise Sauvage Pathway near Haslams Creek Facilities The Pathway is two- lane, marked and sealed throughout, with numerous detours along its length, ranging from two-lane and marked, to one-lane sealed and an assortment of recognised and unrecognised unsealed paths. The pathway is only interrupted in two locations where the access roads cross into Newington, the former athletes' village. Amenities for travellers are provided along the path, including five water fountains and a toilet facility. Historical links The Pathway provides a north-south link between the Parramatta River and the Western Motorway, passing the last remaining piece of virgin woodland in Sydney's Cumberland basin. The Pathway also provides access to Newington Armory as well as passing by some adjoining land, closed to all public access due to unexploded ordnance buried in the swamp. Two of the former buildings of the Newington Arms Depot are accessed by the Pathway and no longer within the grounds of the Armory: Building 46, a renovated educational building operated by Ausgrid, and a former US Navy trench-style artillery bunker behind Newington Precinct 3. These bunkers were serviced by narrow-gauge railway to carry the highly sensitive explosive shells; the rail tracks are still maintained, and many are openly accessible via the Pathway. Environmental links Numerous waterways and wetlands adjoin the Pathway and its linking paths. Some of the water bodies such as Haslams Creek link to the Parramatta River, whereas others such as the Narawang Wetlands are artificial lakes created as part of the Sydney Olympic Park environmental rejuvenation. The Bell Frog Boardwalk side-track provides access to some rare habitat of the Green and Golden Bell Frog. The Newington Nature Reserve contains a Turpentine Ironbark Margin Forest that survives intact in the same condition as it was before Sydney was colonised. Recreation and Events Each year in September the pathway is closed for one day to make way for long-distance bicyclists travelling through Olympic Park. The pathway forms an integral part of the route for sporting events such as the Sydney Spring Cycle (Classic Route). For cross-city riding, many preferred routes will use the combination of Silverwater Road Bridge, River Walk and Louise Sauvage Pathway. Such routes include any travel from the Hills District to the southern suburbs around Liverpool, and from Parramatta to the inner-western suburbs or Sydney Airport via the Cooks River cycleway.

Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars, Head Grammars, and Natural Language. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, CA. as an extension of the context-free grammar class of grammars. Head grammar is therefore a type of phrase structure grammar, as opposed to a dependency grammar. The class of head grammars is a subset of the linear context-free rewriting systems. One typical way of defining head grammars is to replace the terminal strings of CFGs with indexed terminal strings, where the index denotes the \\"head\\" word of the string. Thus, for example, a CF rule such as A \\\\to abc might instead be A \\\\to (abc, 0), where the 0th terminal, the a, is the head of the resulting terminal string. For convenience of notation, such a rule could be written as just the terminal string, with the head terminal denoted by some sort of mark, as in A \\\\to \\\\widehat{a}bc. Two fundamental operations are then added to all rewrite rules: wrapping and concatenation. Operations on headed strings Wrapping Wrapping is an operation on two headed strings defined as follows: Let \\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta and \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta be terminal strings headed by x and y, respectively. w(\\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta) = \\\\alpha x \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta \\\\beta Concatenation Concatenation is a family of operations on n > 0 headed strings, defined for n = 1, 2, 3 as follows: Let \\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta, and \\\\zeta \\\\widehat{z} \\\\eta be terminal strings headed by x, y, and z, respectively. c_{1,0}(\\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta) = \\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta c_{2,0}(\\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta) = \\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta \\\\gamma y \\\\delta c_{2,1}(\\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta) = \\\\alpha x \\\\beta \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta c_{3,0}(\\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta, \\\\zeta \\\\widehat{z} \\\\eta) = \\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta \\\\gamma y \\\\delta \\\\zeta z \\\\eta c_{3,1}(\\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta, \\\\zeta \\\\widehat{z} \\\\eta) = \\\\alpha x \\\\beta \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta \\\\zeta z \\\\eta c_{3,2}(\\\\alpha \\\\widehat{x} \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\widehat{y} \\\\delta, \\\\zeta \\\\widehat{z} \\\\eta) = \\\\alpha x \\\\beta \\\\gamma y \\\\delta \\\\zeta \\\\widehat{z} \\\\eta And so on for c_{m,n} : 0 \\\\leq n < m. One can sum up the pattern here simply as \\"concatenate some number of terminal strings m, with the head of string n designated as the head of the resulting string\\". Form of rules Head grammar rules are defined in terms of these two operations, with rules taking either of the forms X \\\\to w(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) X \\\\to c_{m,n}(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta, ...) where \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, ... are each either a terminal string or a non-terminal symbol. Example Head grammars are capable of generating the language \\\\\\\\{ a^n b^n c^n d^n : n \\\\geq 0 \\\\\\\\}. We can define the grammar as follows: S \\\\to c_{1,0}(\\\\widehat{\\\\epsilon}) S \\\\to c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, T, \\\\widehat{d}) T \\\\to w(S, \\\\widehat{b}c) The derivation for \\"abcd\\" is thus: S c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, T, \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(S, \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(c_{1,0}(\\\\widehat{\\\\epsilon}), \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(\\\\widehat{\\\\epsilon}, \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, \\\\widehat{b}c, \\\\widehat{d}) a\\\\widehat{b}cd And for \\"\\": S c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, T, \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(S, \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, T, \\\\widehat{d}), \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(S, \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}), \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(c_{1,0}(\\\\widehat{\\\\epsilon}), \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}), \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(\\\\widehat{\\\\epsilon}, \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}), \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, \\\\widehat{b}c, \\\\widehat{d}), \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, w(a\\\\widehat{b}cd, \\\\widehat{b}c), \\\\widehat{d}) c_{3,1}(\\\\widehat{a}, ab\\\\widehat{b}ccd, \\\\widehat{d}) aab\\\\widehat{b}ccdd Formal properties Equivalencies Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994)Vijay-Shanker, K. and Weir, David J. 1994.

Playing career  Walley was born in Caernarfon and educated at Ysgol Segontium, named after the town's Roman fort. At the age of 14, he underwent a neck operation which prevented him playing football for almost three years. In March 1963, he joined Caernarfon Town playing in the Welsh League (North);CPD Tref Caernarfon Town ‚Äì History Retrieved 05:04 10 May 2010 after only a handful of games, he briefly joined Wrexham in the spring of 1964, but returned to Caernarfon in August, before (on the recommendation of his elder brother Ernie, who was a former Spurs player) joining English side Arsenal in December 1964 for a fee of ¬£1,000. He played for Arsenal 18 times‚Äî4 of those appearances as a substitute‚Äîand scored once, as well as playing for the Wales under-23 national team, before transferring to Watford in March 1967 for ¬£9,500. During the first of two periods Walley would spend at Vicarage Road as a player, he earnt his sole cap for the Wales national football team; a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Czechoslovakia at Vetch Field, Swansea on 21 April 1971. After making over 200 Football League appearances for Watford, he was sold to Orient at the end of 1971 for ¬£22,500. After 157 league games and 6 goals, Orient sold Walley back to Watford for ¬£3,000 at the end of 1975‚Äì76. His second period at the club was dogged by injury, and Walley managed only 13 further league games before retiring in 1977.  Coaching career  Upon his retirement from playing, Walley became the youth coach at Watford in August 1977. In his early years, players such as Kenny Jackett progressed to the first team. Under his management, Watford won the FA Youth Cup in 1982. Players in that side included future England international John Barnes, future Watford captain, Player of the Season and one-club man Nigel Gibbs, and 1984 FA Cup Finalist Neil Price.Jones p. 287 They again reached the final in 1985. Walley was promoted to first-team coach in 1988 by manager Steve Harrison. When Harrison moved to Millwall in 1990, Walley joined him as a youth coach, and in his first full season Walley lifted the FA Youth Cup for the second time in 1991. Just as he did at Watford, he followed this with a second final three years later. Walley left Millwall to join Arsenal in 1996, serving under Bruce Rioch and Ars√®ne Wenger. In 1996, he was appointed manager of the Wales under-21 team by Bobby Gould.  Personal life  Walley, whose first language is Welsh, was born in the town of Caernarfon, in Gwynedd, north west Wales. His older brother Ernie was also a professional footballer and coach. Ernie briefly managed Crystal Palace in 1980, and coached Watford's reserves while Walley was a first team coach at the club. He now lives in the Nascot area of Watford, Hertfordshire.

Cybernetical methods are understood as methods developed within control theory, information theory, systems theory and related areas: control design, estimation, identification, optimization, pattern recognition, signal processing, image processing, etc. Physical systems are also understood in a broad sense; they may be either lifeless, living nature or of artificial (engineering) origin, and must have reasonably understood dynamics and models suitable for posing cybernetical problems. Research objectives in cybernetical physics are frequently formulated as analyses of a class of possible system state changes under external (controlling) actions of a certain class. An auxiliary goal is designing the controlling actions required to achieve a prespecified property change. Among typical control action classes are functions which are constant in time (bifurcation analysis, optimization), functions which depend only on time (vibration mechanics, spectroscopic studies, program control), and functions whose value depends on measurement made at the same time or on previous instances. The last class is of special interest since these functions correspond to system analysis by means of external feedback (feedback control).  Roots of cybernetical physics  Until recently no creative interaction of physics and control theory (cybernetics) had been seen and no control theory methods were directly used for discovering new physical effects and phenomena. The situation dramatically changed in the 1990s when two new areas emerged: control of chaos and quantum control. Control of chaos  In 1990 a paper was published in Physical Review Letters by Edward Ott, Celso Grebogi and James Yorke from the University of Maryland reporting that even small feedback action can dramatically change the behavior of a nonlinear system, e.g., turn chaotic motions into periodic ones and vice versa. The idea almost immediately became popular in the physics community, and since 1990 hundreds of papers have been published demonstrating the ability of small control, with or without feedback, to significantly change the dynamics of real or model systems. By 2003, this paper by Ott, Grebogi and Yorke had been quoted over 1300 times whilst the total number of papers relating to control of chaos exceeded 4000 by the beginning of the 21st century, with 300-400 papers per year being published in peer reviewed journals. The method proposed in is now called the OGY-method after the authors' initials. Later, a number of other methods were proposed for transforming chaotic trajectories into periodic ones, for example delayed feedback (Pyragas method). Numerous nonlinear and adaptive control methods were also applied for the control of chaos, see surveys in.Fradkov A.L., Pogromsky A.Yu., Introduction to control of oscillations and chaos. Singapore: World Scientific Publ., 1998.Handbook of Chaos Control, Second completely revised and enlarged edition, Eds: E. Schoell, H.G. Schuster. Wiley-VCH, 2007. It is important that the results obtained were interpreted as discovering new properties of physical systems. Thousands of papers were published that examine and predict properties of systems based on the use of control, identification and other cybernetic methods. Notably, most of those papers were published in physical journals, their authors representing university physics departments. It has become clear that such types of control goals are important not only for the control of chaos, but also for the control of a broader class of oscillatory processes. This provides evidence for the existence of an emerging field of research related to both physics and control, that of \\"cybernetical physics\\".Fradkov AL. Investigation of physical systems by feedback. Autom. Remote Control 60 (3): 471-483, 1999. Quantum control It is conceivable that molecular physics was the area where ideas of control first appeared. James Clerk Maxwell introduced a hypothetical being, known as Maxwell's Demon, with the ability to measure the velocities of gas molecules in a vessel and to direct the fast molecules to one part of the vessel while keeping the slow molecules in another part. This produces a temperature difference between the two parts of the vessel, which seems to contradict the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Now, after more than a century of fruitful life, this demon is even more active than in the past. Recent papers discussed issues relating to the experimental implementation of Maxwell's Demon, particularly at the quantum-mechanical level.Leff H.S. and A.F.Rex (Eds). Maxwell's Demon 2: entropy, classical and quantum information, computing: 2nd edition. Institute of Physics. 2003. At the end of the 1970s the first mathematical results for the control of quantum mechanical models appeared based on control theoryButkovskii A.G., Samoilenko Yu.I. Control of Quantum-Mechanical Processes. Dordrecht: Kluwer Acad. Publ., 1990 (In Russian: Moscow: Nauka, 1984, At the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s rapid developments in the laser industry led to the appearance of ultrafast, so- called femtosecond lasers. This new generation of lasers has the ability to generate pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds and even less (1 fs = 10^{-15}sec). The duration of such a pulse is comparable with the period of a molecule's natural oscillation. Therefore, a femtosecond laser can, in principle, be used as a mean of controlling single molecules and atoms. A consequence of such an application is the possibility of realizing the alchemists' dream of changing the natural course of chemical reactions. A new area in chemistry emerged, femtochemistry, and new femtotechnologies were developed. Ahmed Zewail from Caltech was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on femtochemistry. Using modern control theory, new horizons may open for studying the interaction of atoms and molecules, and new ways and possible limits may be discovered for intervening in the intimate processes of the microworld. Besides, control is an important part of many recent nanoscale applications, including nanomotors, nanowires, nanochips, nanorobots, etc. The number of publications in peer reviewed journals exceeds 600 per year. Control thermodynamics The basics of thermodynamics were stated by Sadi Carnot in 1824. He considered a heat engine which operates by drawing heat from a source which is at thermal equilibrium at temperature T_{hot}, and delivering useful work. Carnot saw that, in order to operate continuously, the engine requires also a cold reservoir with the temperature T_{cold}, to which some heat can be discharged. By simple logic he established the famous ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôCarnot Principle‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô: ‚Äò‚ÄôNo heat engine can be more efficient than a reversible one operating between the same temperatures‚Äô‚Äô. In fact it was nothing but the solution to an optimal control problem: maximum work can be extracted by a reversible machine and the value of extracted work depends only on the temperatures of the source and the bath. Later, Kelvin introduced his absolute temperature scale (Kelvin scale) and accomplished the next step, evaluating Carnot's reversible efficiency \\\\eta_{Carnot}=1-\\\\frac{T_{cold}}{T_{hot}}. However, most work was devoted to studying stationary systems over infinite time intervals, while for practical purposes it is important to know the possibilities and limitations of the system's evolution for finite times as well as under other types of constraints caused by a finite amount of available resources. The pioneer work devoted to evaluating finite time limitations for heat engines was published by I. Novikov in 1957,Novikov I.I., The efficiency of atomic power stations, Atomic Energy 3 (11), 409--412, 1957; (English translation: Nuclear Energy II 7. 125‚Äì-128, 1958). and independently by F.L. Curzon and B. Ahlborn in 1975: the efficiency at maximum power per cycle of a heat engine coupled to its surroundings through a constant heat conductor is \\\\eta_{NCA}=1-\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{T_{cold}}{T_{hot}}} (the Novikov-Curzon-Ahlborn formula). The Novikov-Curzon-Ahlborn process is also optimal in the sense of minimal dissipation. Otherwise, if the dissipation degree is given, the process corresponds to the maximum entropy principle. Later, the results were extended and generalized for other criteria and for more complex situations based on modern optimal control theory. As a result, a new direction in thermodynamics arose known under the names \\"optimization thermodynamics\\", \\"finite-time thermodynamics\\", Endoreversible thermodynamics or \\"control thermodynamics\\", see.Berry R.S., Kazakov V.A., Sieniutycz S., Szwast Z., Tsirlin A.M. Thermodynamic Optimization of Finite Time Processes. Wiley. N.Y., 2000.  Subject and methodology of cybernetical physics  By the end of the 1990s it had become clear that a new area in physics dealing with control methods had emerged. The term \\"cybernetical physics\\" was proposed in.Fradkov A.L. Investigation of physical systems by means of feedback. Autom. Remote Control. V. 60, 1999, N 3, pp.3-22 The subject and methodology of the field are systematically presented in.Fradkov A.L. Cybernetical physics: from control of chaos to quantum control. Springer-Verlag, 2007, (Preliminary Russian version: St.Petersburg, Nauka, 2003). A description of the control problems related to cybernetical physics includes classes of controlled plant models, control objectives (goals) and admissible control algorithms. The methodology of cybernetical physics comprises typical methods used for solving problems and typical results in the field. Models of controlled systems A formal statement of any control problem begins with a model of the system to be controlled (plant) and a model of the control objective (goal). Even if the plant model is not given (the case in many real world applications) it should be determined in some way. The system models used in cybernetics are similar to traditional models of physics and mechanics with one difference: the inputs and outputs of the model should be explicitly specified. The following main classes of models are considered in the literature related to control of physical systems: continuous systems with lumped parameters described in state space by differential equations, distributed (spatio-temporal) systems described by partial differential equations, and discrete-time state-space models described by difference equations. Control goals It is natural to classify control problems by their control goals. Five kinds are listed below. Regulation (often called stabilization or positioning) is the most common and simple control goal. Regulation is understood as driving the state vector x(t) (or the output vector y(t)) to some equilibrium state x* (respectively, y*). Tracking. State tracking is driving a solution x(t) to the prespecified function of time x*(t). Similarly, output tracking is driving the output y(t) to the desired output function y*(t). The problem is more complex if the desired equilibrium x* or trajectory x*(t) is unstable in the absence of control action. For example, a typical problem of chaos control can be formulated as tracking an unstable periodic solution (orbit). The key feature of the control problems for physical systems is that the goal should be achieved by means of sufficiently small control. A limit case is stabilization of a system by an arbitrarily small control. The solvability of this task is not obvious if the trajectory x*(t) is unstable, for example in the case of chaotic systems. See. Generation (excitation) of oscillations. The third class of control goals corresponds to the problems of \\"excitation\\" or \\"generation\\" of oscillations. Here, it is assumed that the system is initially at rest. The problem is to find out if it is possible to drive it into an oscillatory mode with the desired characteristics (energy, frequency, etc.) In this case the goal trajectory of the state vector x*(t) is not prespecified. Moreover, the goal trajectory may be unknown, or may even be irrelevant to the achievement of the control goal. Such problems are well known in electrical, radio engineering, acoustics, laser, and vibrational technologies, and indeed wherever it is necessary to create an oscillatory mode for a system. Such a class of control goals can be related to problems of dissociation, ionization of molecular systems, escape from a potential well, chaotization, and other problems related to the growth of the system energy and its possible phase transition. Sometimes such problems can be reduced to tracking, but the reference trajectories x*(t) in these cases are not necessarily periodic and may be unstable. Besides, the goal trajectory x*(t) may be known only partially. Synchronization. The fourth important class of control goals corresponds to synchronization (more accurately, \\"controlled synchronization\\" as distinct from \\"autosynchronization\\" or \\"self-synchronization\\"). Generally speaking, synchronization is understood as concurrent change of the states of two or more systems or, perhaps, concurrent change of some quantities related to the systems, e.g., equalizing of oscillation frequencies. If the required relation is established only asymptotically, one speaks of \\"asymptotic synchronization\\". If synchronization does not exist in the system without control the problem may be posed as finding the control function which ensures synchronization in the closed-loop system, i.e., synchronization may be a control goal. Synchronization problem differs from the model reference control problem in that some phase shifts between the processes are allowed that are either constant or tend to constant values. Besides, in a number of synchronization problems the links between the systems to be synchronized are bidirectional. In such cases the limit mode (synchronous mode) in the overall system is not known in advance. Modification of the limit sets (attractors) of the systems. The last class of control goals is related to the modification of some quantitative characteristics that limit the behavior of the system. It includes such specific goals as *changing the type of the equilibrium (e.g., transforming an unstable equilibrium into a stable one, or vice versa); * changing the type of the limit set (e.g., transforming a limit cycle into a chaotic attractor, or vice versa, changing the fractal dimension of the limit set, etc.); * changing the position or the type of the bifurcation point in the parameter space of the system. Investigation of the above problems started at the end of the 1980s with work on bifurcation control and continued with work on the control of chaos. Ott, Grebogi and Yorke and their followers introduced a new class of control goals not requiring any quantitative characteristic of the desired motion. Instead, the desired qualitative type of the limit set (attractor) was specified, e.g., control should provide the system with a chaotic attractor. Additionally, the desired degree of chaoticity may be specified by specifying the Lyapunov exponent, fractal dimension, entropy, etc. See. In addition to the main control goal, some additional goals or constraints may be specified. A typical example is the \\"small control\\" requirement: the control function should have little power or should require a small expenditure of energy. Such a restriction is needed to avoid \\"violence\\" and preserve the inherent properties of the system under control. This is important for ensuring the elimination of artefacts and for an adequate study of the system. Three types of control are used in physical problems: constant control, feedforward control and feedback control. Implementation of a feedback control requires additional measurement devices working in real time, which are often hard to install. Therefore, studying the system may start with the application of inferior forms of control: time- constant and then feedforward control. The possibilities of changing system behavior by means of feedback control can then be studied. Methodology The methodology of cybernetical physics is based on control theory. Typically, some parameters of physical systems are unknown and some variables are not available for measurement. From the control viewpoint this means that control design should be performed under significant uncertainty, i.e., methods of robust control or adaptive control should be used. A variety of design methods have been developed by control theorists and control engineers for both linear and nonlinear systems. Methods of partial control, control by weak signals, etc. have also been developed.  Fields of research and prospects Currently, an interest in applying control methods in physics is still growing. The following areas of research are being actively developed: *Control of oscillations *Control of synchronization *Control of chaos, bifurcations *Control of phase transitions, stochastic resonance *Optimal control in thermodynamics *Control of micromechanical, molecular and quantum systems Among the most important applications are: control of fusion, control of beams, control in nano- and femto-technologies. In order to facilitate information exchange in the area of cybernetical physics the International Physics and Control Society (IPACS) was created. IPACS organizes regular conferences (Physics and Control Conferences) and supports an electronic library, IPACS Electronic Library and an information portal, Physics and Control Resources.

South Bay Phalanx was one of several Fourier-based communities that began in the United States. The location was that of an abandoned Shaker Community, which gave them a significant advantage in starting a utopian community. The land included a variety of fruit trees, a saw mill, community and residential buildings. However, despite this advantage, the community eventually disbanded due to significant financial trouble. The financial trouble was caused by an influx of new residents from the Erie Canal area experiencing financial hardship, as well as the overly generous return on investment to residents. The large number of residents, many of which were characterized as lazy, only added to the quick spread of typhoid fever in 1844. The final crack in the society occurred when \\"evangelical Protestants and religious liberals\\" fought over the educational methods and curriculum. In April 1846, the remaining thirteen members officially dissolved the community, which at its height had over 264 members.

Croatian dance varies by region, and can be found throughout the various regions of Austria, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia, Hungary, and Romania. The traditional kolo is a circle dance, where dancers follow each other around the circle, is relatively simple in form and widespread throughout other Slavic countries. Due to emigration, Croatian folk dance groups are prevalent throughout the diaspora, most notably the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany. Music is a very important part of Croatian folk dance, with of the most common instruments used are the tamburica, lijerica, jedinka, ≈°argija, gusle, bagpipe, and accordion. Today, kolo is danced at weddings, baptisms, holidays such as Easter, and ethnic festivals. History The circle dance is one of the basic forms of Croatian folk dance. It is regarded as the oldest form of dance, and can be seen as an expression of community, especially in village life. Throughout a large part of Croatia right up until World War II, the kolo had been the centre of village social life. The kolo as a dance became a tool for social gathering, and was often the main place at which young women and men could get to know each other. With many dances, the singing of jocular verses during the performance served as a way to express feelings or tell a story. By singing, movement, and gestures one could express what was proscribed in ordinary speech. Many young men and women used this as an excuse for courting and teasing one another. Occasions where people may have performed a kolo outdoors on special occasions include harvests, weddings, and religious celebrations to honor a special saint. More recently, the dances are performed at weddings, concerts, festivals or ethnic celebrations. Other european dances became popular in certain parts of the country such as the polka in the north and the furlana in Istria, due to German/Austrian and Italian influences respectively. Kolo Slavonia and Baranja A Croatian-Austrian folklore group getting ready to perform Often considered to be the richest and liveliest of all Croatian dancing, the dancing from Slavonia is composed of difficult steps and lively music. *≈†okaƒçko kolo *Izvir voda izvirala *Igra kolo u dvadeset i dva *Povraƒáanac *Dorata *Logovac *≈Ωita *Srce moje *Todore *Mista *Kabanica *Jabuƒçice *Ranƒçe *Sitne bole Posavina Like most northern Croatian dances, Posavina kolo is lively with plenty of singing. The Drme≈° dance is one of the most popular types of kolo in Croatia, and can be seen throughout the regions. * Drme≈° * Staro sito * ≈Ωenina Volja - A woman's will * Repa * Duƒçec * Oj Savice, tija vodo ladna - Podravina Dances from Podravina are close to the Slavonian dances in style, which is lively with plenty of singing, which is typical for north Croatian folk dances. *Drme≈° * Grizlica * Ples z ropƒçecom * Moldovan - literally Moldovan, believed to originate from local Romani. * Jelica kolce vodila * Lepa Anka kolo vodi * Rendajte se milo lane * Tronjaka * Sejale smo ba≈æulka * Na kraj sela kolo igra * Postajale cure oko kola * Gusta magla ti ne padaj na me * ≈Ωena ide na gosti * Katarena kolo vodi Hrvatsko Zagorje Hrvatsko Zagorje, or Croatian hinterland, is the north- central part of the country, which the capital Zagreb is a part of. Dances are lively and merry. * Drme≈° * Nebeska * Ober≈°tajer * ≈†rote≈° * Ajnzerica - a lively dance said to have been derived from local gypsys from Marija Bistrica * Repa * Kriƒçi kriƒçi tiƒçek * ≈Ωena i≈°la u gosti * Podmostec * ≈Ωenil se sirotek * Dobar vecer dobri ljudi A variation of the traditional polka: * Puntarska polka * Judin polka * Krajc polka Meƒëimurje The Meƒëimurje region is the northern-est tip of Croatia, and shares much of the merry and lively dance qualities as other nearby regions. *ƒåarda≈° *Do≈°la sam vam japa dimo - derived from traditional solo songs *Kalaptanc *Kuritari *Regica *Kaj se z Jelkom pripetilo *Igrajte nam japa *Faljila se Jagica *Lepe na≈°e senoko≈°e *Zginula je piku≈°a *≈†o≈°tar polka *≈Ωena ide na gosti *Vanjku≈°ec *Baro≈° oj Barice Istria Dances from Istria have strong influence from Venetian culture. * Balun * Cotiƒá * Hrvaski - literally, \\"Croatian\\" dance * Korak * Polka * ≈†tajeri≈° Lika Kolo from the Crikvenica area Kolo from Lika can have music and instruments, or it can be silent with no instrumental accompaniment or even singing. With the silent dances, the only sounds being made are when the feet make contact with the floor and the rhythmic clinking sound of the women's coin necklaces, and sometimes, the dancers' voices as they sing. Though not often danced these days, these silent dances are well remembered by the older Liƒçani and are perpetuated by folk dance performing groups. *Liƒçko kolo - traditional Lika dance *Tanac *Haj na lijevo *Milica *Oj Otoƒçcu - from the town of Otoƒçac *Perjato, Rasperjato *Okreni se, moje kolo malo *Joj, moj dragane, ti ne radi toga Dalmatia and islands Folk dancers in ƒåilipi (Dalmatia) Due to its geography and history of foreign occupation, Dalmatia has a variety of dances influenced by its history. One example is the popular dance Linƒëo from Dubrovnik and southern Dalmatia, which has a distinct Mediterranean influence. On the other hand, the Nijemo Kolo from the Dalmatian hinterland shows influences of the Ottoman era on the region. * Linƒëo * Nijemo Kolo * Potkolo - line dance done to tamburica * Poskacica - a couple dance done to the lijerica * Nemigusa - a \\"winking\\" couple dance * Seljanica - popular * Vrliƒçko kolo - from the town of Vrlika * Ba≈°ka J' Malo Selo - From the village of Baska on Krk island * Lipa li je rumen Ro≈æica - from the island of Murter * Dubravaƒçko Kolo ‚Äì Poskoƒçica - merry dance from the Dubrovnik countryside * Dubravaƒçko Kolenda - A Dubrovnik carol Bosnia and Herzegovina Dances from Herzegovina are often a cross between Dalmatian Zagora traditions, and Ottoman influences, though much less than Bosnia proper. * Sremica * Vrtikolo * O javore, javore *Koja Gora Ivo * Na Neretvu misecina pala Serbia (Vojvodina) Bunjevac Dance Dances from Vojvodina are most similar to the Slavonian dances in their liveliness and activity. The Bunjevci Croats from the Baƒçka region are renowned for their beautifully embroidered female dresses, made from real silk from France, and the rattling sound made by the dancers' boots as they dance. In the Banat region, the men have their own competitive dance. * ≈†okaƒçko kolo * Tandraƒçak * Bunjevaƒçko momaƒçko kolo - literally the Bunjevac men's kolo, where one man dances with two women * Momacko nadigravanje - the men's competitive dance * Kolo Igra, Tamburica Svira * Malo kolo * Podvikuje Bunjevaƒçka Vila Hungary and Romania Croatian folklore dance meeting in P√©cs, Hungary Croatian kolo from Hungary is mainly concentrated in the southern region near Baranja, while in Romania, it is in the Banat region. Due to Hungarian influence, the Cs√°rd√°s remains one of the most popular dances among all ethnic groups. * Tanac * ≈†okadija * Predgovor * Dunje ranke * Ranƒçe * Todore * Kratka drmavica * Tandrƒçak * Ide sna≈°a * Maricce kolo * Na dvi strane kolo * Jabuke * Romanska * Kukunje≈°ƒáe * Rotkve * Trojanac * Devojƒçe, Radojƒçe * Paƒçiƒái * Kolo * Narodne no≈°nje Other dance The More≈°ka in Korƒçula On the island of Korƒçula in the Adriatic, the popular sword dance, the More≈°ka is still prevalent and performed at festivals and special events. In the nineteenth century, a new form of ballroom dancing emerged in Croatia. Elements of European ballroom spread throughout the region, and dances such as the polka soon became widespread all throughout the Croatian regions. Croatian ballroom dancing, or salonsko kolo, emerged in the nineteenth century as a result of the above influences.Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research, Vol. 12, No. 2. \\"Salonsko Kolo: Dance of Nineteenth-Century Croatian Ballrooms\\", by Zdravko Bla≈æekoviƒá p 114 Due to the Croatian national revival and re-awakening of Croatian culture and national identity, an effort was made to incorporate traditional music and dances into the urban dance revival. Thus, the intellectual idealists saw kolo as a quintessential Slavic dance, and chose to adopt it for the urban context itDance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research, Vol. 12, No. 2. \\"Salonsko Kolo: Dance of Nineteenth- Century Croatian Ballrooms\\", by Zdravko Bla≈æekoviƒá p 115-116 It was at this time that the hrvatsko kolo emerged as a choreographed dance. Due to the strong Venetian/Italian influence in Istria and parts of Dalmatia, the furlana has become a part of the culture of the people, most especially in Vodnjan. A specific strain on the furlana song is called the \\"Polesana\\", and is thought to originate from Istria; either from either the Italian word for 'a woman from Pola' (Pula), or from the Croatian word \\"polesa\\", meaning \\"rural\\".The Journal of Musicology, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Winter, 1999). \\"A Venetian Dancing Master Teaches the Forlana: Lambranzi's Balli Teatrali\\" by Daniel Heartz. Since the Burgenland Croats from Austria have been under the influence of German/Austrian and Hungarian cultures, they formed their own dance traditions, influenced by the liveliness of the polka and the cs√°rd√°s. An example is the 'File≈æ dance' from Nikitsch, which is light-hearted and cheerful, with dancers often bringing in props to the dance, like a broom or a bottle.Volkst√§nze Costume Many Croatian dances have the participants wearing a national costume. National costumes, or folk dresses, vary from region to region in style, design, color, material, shape and form. Thus, each region's national dress expresses an identity related to the geographic area it comes from, much like the kolo dance.
