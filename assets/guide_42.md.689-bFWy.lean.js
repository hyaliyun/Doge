Prof. Simon Haykin is Professor of Electrical Engineering; noted for his pioneering work in Adaptive Signal Processing with emphasis on applications to Radar Engineering and Telecom Technology. He is currently Distinguished University Professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He received BSc (First-Class Honours); Ph.D., and DSc., degrees-all in Electrical Engineering from University of Birmingham, UK (England). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. In 2002 he became a recipient of Henry Booker Gold Medal from URSI and in 1999 received Hon. Degree of Doctor of Technical Science from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and many other medals and prizes. In mid-1980s, he shifted thrust of his research effort in direction of Neural Computation, which was re-emerging at that time. All along, he had a vision of revisiting fields of radar engineering and telecom technology from a brand new perspective. That vision became a reality in early years of this century with publication of two seminal journal papers: ‚ÄúCognitive Radio: Brain-empowered Wireless communications‚Äù, which appeared in IEEE J. Selected Areas in Communications, Feb. 2005. ‚ÄúCognitive Radar: A Way of the Future‚Äù, which appeared in the IEEE J. Signal Processing, Feb. 2006.

With an area of over 167.8 hectares,Cmentarz Centralny w Szczecinie and still expanding, it is officially the largest cemetery in Poland and the third largest cemetery in Europe. History The Central Cemetery in Szczecin was established in 1901Cmentarz Centralny w Szczecinie as a new and modern cemetery in what was then Stettin in German Pomerania. It was formerly called the Hauptfriedhof Stettin (Stettin Main Cemetery) and was modeled on the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg, Germany. Even though it has been operating for more than 100 years, it is still in use, and it is a legally protected national monument. The first part of the new cemetery was located in the fields on the eastern outskirts of the city. It was designed by Wilhelm Meyer- Schwartau, a prolific architect of Stettin. The composition of the greenery was designed by landscape architect Georg Hanning. Wilhelm Meyer-Schwartau planned the layout of the new cemetery, and also designed a neo-romanesque central chapel and a monumental 77-meter-long main entrance gate. In total, there are eleven gates leading to the cemetery. The Central Cemetery was intended as a picturesque park or memorial-garden. This goal was achieved through utilizing the natural features of the landscape. Most of the roads in the old part of the cemetery are curved and form a net of small circles. The main road, leading from the central gate to the central chapel, is flanked by old plane trees. The main chapel was destroyed in the fire of 1981 and took 13 years to rebuild. In 1925, a crematory was constructed next to it. Today there is only one chapel in the cemetery, facing a big decorative pool with a fountain. It forms the main axis connecting the east and west part of the cemetery. The new ‚Äì west part of the cemetery was created about 1930, on a site which had been used as a military training area. Most roads in this part of the cemetery are straight, running parallel to two natural streams which flow through the whole terrain. In this part of the cemetery in the 1930 there was also a chapel, modern in style, but it was demolished during the Second World War, and eventually pulled down in 1984. After Stettin became Polish in 1945 and renamed Szczecin, the authorities rechristened the cemetery to its present Polish name. On the site of the Central Cemetery there are many places of historical interest, such as a lapidarium with old gravestones and grave sculptures, and an old windmill (today converted into a garden centre). One of the quarters houses graves of notable individuals, such as artists and politicians. There are also monuments devoted to veterans, people who died at sea, unborn children and concentration camps victims. Monuments Pomnik Braterstwa Broni The best known monument is Pomnik Braterstwa Broni (Monument of Brothers in Arms) made in 1967 and designed by S≈Çawomir Lewi≈Ñski. It is a military monument which looks like hussar wings. The monument is situated on the hill on the main axis. From this place there is a beautiful view on the main chapel. The Central Cemetery in Szczecin is like a huge park in the centre of the city, with many old and different kind of trees and high shaped hedges made of deciduous or coniferous bushes. It is similar to a big botanical garden but not everyone, even in Szczecin, knows about this original collection of trees and bushes. Some parts of the cemetery are very natural, there are thickets and meadows, especially the green belts located parallel to the streams. It is a very important ecological space for many little animals, birds and insects such as foxes, hares, hedgehogs, red squirrels, wilds ducks etc. In the cemetery there is also one educational board with photos of these wild animals and some information about them.

In this system the males generally provide no paternal care. In many spider species that are monogynous, the males have two copulatory organs, which allows them to mate a maximum of twice throughout their lifetime. As is commonly seen in honeybees, ants and certain spider species, a male may put all his energy into a single copulation, knowing that this will lower his overall fitness. During copulation monogynous males have adapted to cause self genital damage or even death to increase their chances of paternity.  Definition and distinction  Monogyny is one of several mating systems observed in nature, in which a male mates only once; females, however, may mate with multiple males. It is important to emphasize the distinctions between monogyny and polyandry, and monogyny and monogamy. Polyandry is a mating system by which a female mates with more than one male; the male, in turn, can also mate with more than the one female. In a monogamous setting, both male and female consent to having only one mate at any one time and thus mate only with that partner for that time period. Hence, monogyny is sometimes referred to as male monogamy because the male only mates with one female.  Examples  The mating system of monogyny is most common in ants, honeybees, and spiders.  In colony species  In species of ants and honeybees, there is only one female queen who mates with all the males in her colony; the males attend to the queen and mate only with her. There are circumstances, however, where a colony can become queenless, and therefore certain males must adapt to this surrounding in order to increase paternity. In ants and honeybees, there are two different types of monogynous settings. Type A are monogynous, queenright colonies where the queen is the mated female and everyone else is unmated. Type B are monogynous, worker-reproductive colonies where there is no queen but rather there are gamergates, which are mated workers who take on a queen-like role. The queen is normally the only egg producer. However, when a colony becomes queenless, some workers which have intact, undeveloped ovaries may develop them and thus become capable of laying more eggs. So in certain colonies, a singly mated worker called a gamergate reproduces as the functional queen in that colony. These workers are termed \\"totipotent\\"; that is, they are able to change and adapt to a different surrounding in which they no longer have a queen.  In spiders  Males in certain species of spiders often employ drastic methods to be paternally successful. Monogyny in spiders culminates in extreme traits, such as dramatic male self-sacrifice and emasculation of the male by the female during copulation. Since males only mate with one female in a monogynous setting, each individual male must do whatever it takes to increase his particular paternity success, even if it means sacrificing himself. Male redback spiders twist their abdomens onto the fangs of their mates during copulation and, if cannibalized (65% of matings), increase their paternity relative to males that are not cannibalized. In this way, males of the redback spiders in a monogynous setting increase their chance of paternity by actually surrendering themselves to be cannibalized by the female. Male sacrifice tactics Genital plugging The benefits of mate guarding and securing paternity are higher than searching for many mates in a monogynous system. A male securing his paternity becomes a male's first priority during reproduction. One way they mate guard is by creating a physical barrier to turn away any other males. The male can cause severe physical damage to themselves by breaking off their pedipalps in order to plug the genital opening of the female. Males of Argiope bruennichi remove their pedipalp into the females and thus reduce the risk of sperm competition. Males can also remove the sperm of a previous mate from the female and deposit their own sperm, increasing their likelihood of success for that copulation. In the golden orb spider the male may sacrifice both of his copulatory organs in one mating in order to turn away any wandering males. In other cases we see the casting off of other body parts such as the anterior legs in the golden orb spider when the male is attacked by an aggressive female. By doing this he can continue to mate with her while she eats his legs and does not eat him whole. Self sacrifice and cannibalism Copulation in a monogynous male is a sacrificial system. They not only cause genital damage to themselves but in many cases die during copulation spontaneously such as Argiope aurantia or are cannibalized by the female. This can be observed in many spider species such as the red back spider which consumes the male either during or right after copulation if the male is not quick enough to escape. The size and age of the female play a role on whether or not the male was able to escape. They usually were not successful in the attempt to escape if the female was older and heavier making her much more dominant than the male. Another factor on the survival or demise of the male is the duration of the copulation. If there is a high copulation time the chances of him being eaten are much higher. If the copulation has a duration of ten seconds or more the chances of him being eaten are much greater than those that jump off before ten seconds. Monogyny increases a male's chance of paternity when there is a male biased ratio in the population. When males make up a large majority of the population, the likelihood of finding multiple females is slim. Thus the males will mate with the first female they encounter. Mate guarding her from other males is more beneficial than looking for another female because the odds of meeting another female in a male biased population are against him.  Costs and benefits  From a male standpoint, evolutionary theory suggests that the focus of mating is to enhance paternity in order to produce viable offspring. Therefore, sexual selection theory would suggest that a male should attempt to mate with several females. This means that if a male wants to ensure that he will be paternally successful, he should mate with more than one female. When the sex ratio is male biased, however, male monogamy (monogyny) would arise as a means of increasing paternity and producing offspring; in other words, if the setting contains a sex ratio of all male to one female, then monogyny would arise as a means to produce offspring. This model predicts that a male-biased sex ratio is required for monogyny to evolve. *For females: the advantages and benefits are significant to that of males and are clear and obvious. The monogynous female is dominant over the males and has great reproductive value. *For males: Since they can mate with only one female, they must adapt in order to increase their chance of paternity.  Male adaptation  Males can adapt in order to increase paternity in a monogynous setting. An example of this would be the formation of gamergates in a queenless colony of honeybees and/or ants. Another example would be male-sacrifice in order to increase paternity in certain species of spiders. The costs of increasing paternity in a monogynous setting are great for the males; in certain species of spiders the male will surrender himself to be cannibalized in order to increase paternity. In this respect, the benefit for the female is that she will receive the chance to eat if she is hungry; the cost for the male is the loss of life to increase his paternity. In certain species, male adaptation will include the process of pedipalp damage. Males in species of the golden orb weaver, for instance, can protect their paternity by obstructing the female's genital openings with fragments of their copulatory organs. The male will actively participate in damaging his genitals by breaking off parts of his copulatory organs during mating and obstructing the female's genital openings in order to be paternally successful.  Evolutionary significance  Male animals, especially in species where males provide little or no parental investment (time and energy invested in current offspring at the expense of future offspring), are generally expected to maximize their fitness by mating with several females. In certain monogynous settings, however, paternal investment by the male is greater than that of males in other mating systems because the benefits of paternal protection exceed those of searching for additional mates. Paternal investment includes even dramatic examples such as the remarkable adaptation of male sacrifice via sexual cannibalism and the ability to inflict genital damage unto oneself to increase paternity success. In these circumstances, selection may favor extreme mechanisms of paternity protection that amount to a maximal investment in a single mating. There are also circumstances in which monogyny evolves when males do not provide any paternal investment. Researchers have focused on sexual behaviour in systems where males have low paternal investment but frequently mate only once in their lifetimes, after which they are often killed by the female. Mating effort is high for these males. In particular, time and energy costs or risks incurred by males in securing a given mating could decrease the relative number of males available for mating; this type of mating is called non-promiscuous. Researchers have focused on species of web-building spiders with males that show high levels of non-promiscuous mating effort but apparently low paternal investment. The mechanism of male monogamy (monogyny) in these species is indisputably the most extreme form of non-promiscuous mating effort.

He is best known for his radio plays, which are characterised by their emphasis upon dialogue rather than narrative. Radio dramatist Rhys Adrian worked in stage management before becoming a writer, contributing material to summer shows, revues, pantomimes and West End musicals. His first radio play, The Man on the Gate, was broadcast by the BBC Home Service in November 1956. By the early 1960s he was beginning to develop the dramatic style that would become a hallmark of his subsequent work. A Nice Clean Sheet of Paper (1964) features a talkative and condescending job interviewer (played by Donald Wolfit) whose attempts to communicate with an unresponsive applicant (John Wood) drive him to incoherent blathering. Evelyn (1969), which starred Ian Richardson and Pauline Collins as a couple trapped in an extra-marital and over-crowded affair, won the RAI Prize for Literary and Dramatic Programmes at the Prix Italia and was later adapted for television. Buffet (1976) saw Richard Briers playing a borderline alcoholic city gent unwinding at a railway buffet at the end of a long and exhausting day. In an introduction to the broadcast, John Tydeman, then head of Radio 4 drama, and the producer of 27 of Adrian's plays, paid tribute to the author - referring to him as \\"one of the great unknown British playwrights [...] very much a language man rather than a man who used whizzy, 'show-offy' radio.\\" 1982's Watching the Plays Together was one of Adrian's most experimental works. Consisting largely of a conversation between a middle-aged married couple troubled by the trend towards social realism in television drama, the play won the Giles Cooper Award for outstanding writing for radio. As a mark of his status as a playwright, Adrian's plays throughout the 1980s boasted casts made up of distinguished actors - including, amongst others, John Gielgud (Passing Time; 1983), Michael Aldridge (Outpatient; 1985) and Peter Vaughn (Toytown; 1987). His last radio play, Upended, was broadcast in 1988. Screenwriter In addition to his work on radio, Adrian wrote a number of television plays. Big Time (1961), his first piece for television, was co- written with Julian Pepper under the pseudonym 'J. MacReady'. 1963's Too Old for Donkeys was an adaptation of his own radio play broadcast earlier that year. Adrian reworked several of his radio scripts for television, often to varying levels of success. His adaptation of Evelyn for the BBC's Play for Today strand was deemed \\"unsatisfying\\" by critic David Wade, who felt that Adrian's stylised dialogue clashed with the physicality of the piece, leaving the play at a disadvantage. Buffet also suffered upon its transition to television. Adrian, however, wrote a number of original works for the medium, often as part of anthology series such as The Wednesday Play, Theatre 625, Armchair Theatre, ITV Playhouse and the aforementioned Play for Today; his 1971 play The Foxtrot marked an early departure from the latter series' emphasis on socially aware, issue-based drama towards broad comedy and non- naturalism. In 1973, his play The Withered Arm was transmitted, alongside contributions from Dennis Potter and David Mercer, as part of the Wessex Tales series for BBC2, a group of plays based on the short stories of Thomas Hardy. Style and themes Adrian's plays are driven by character and dialogue rather than narrative; they are conversation pieces, usually between two characters, which feature highly stylised language used to a jarring, sometimes surreal, effect. In No Charge for the Extra Service (1979), the bereaved central characters, Elizabeth Spriggs and Nigel Stock, brought together by a dating agency, converse in a formal, almost artificial manner that belies the uncomfortable and disturbing truths they reveal about themselves throughout the course of the play. This emphasis on dialogue leaves Adrian's characters constantly seeking a connection with each other, bolstered by the desire to be understood. 'The Man' in Evelyn desperately wants his declarations of love towards his mistress to be acknowledged, while Hugh Burden's disturbed mental patient in 1981's Passing Through attempts to piece together his broken past by engaging lonely signalman Patrick (Harry Towb) in meandering conversation. Similarly, the two down-and-outs in The Clerks (1978), Freddie Jones and Hugh Burden, seek to reclaim their lost past as intelligence agents by scrupulously poring over the events that led to them being homeless and derelict. While highly articulate, both men challenge the other's story, almost as if attempting to expose lies and half-truths. By the end of the play, perhaps owing to their alcohol consumption throughout the piece, their testimonies have become so outrageous as to be nothing but fabrication. Adrian frequently raises the question of his characters' reliability as 'narrators', their recollections viewed only through the prism of personal experience. The two nonagenarians in Passing Time (John Gielgud and Raymond Huntley) constantly back-pedal when recalling their dim and distant pasts, one memory bumping into the next, often cancelling out the previous remembrance. This is also explored in Watching the Plays Together, which examines the relationship between audience and playwright by creating an imaginary dialogue between the two, balancing the fine line between fiction and reality and providing the listener with an active role in the drama instead of a passive one.

He was the first president of the Cooperative Health Federation of America, and an advocate for cooperative health care and preventive medicine. Early life Shadid was born in 1882 in Marjayoun, a town in modern Lebanon, but then in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. He was the youngest of 12 children. He attended the American University's high school in Beirut. In 1898 he emigrated to the United States where he was a pack peddler and sold cheap jewelry and buttons door to door. Shadid attended John Tarleton College in Stephenville, Texas, in 1902 and received a degree in medicine from Washington University in St. Louis in 1907. While in medical school, he joined the Socialist Party of America. He ran for congress as a New Deal Democrat, but was defeated by Sam Massingale. Shadid married Adeeba Shadid and they had six children: Bess, Fred, Ethel, Alexander, Ruth, and Helen. Career In 1923, Shadid left his successful practice in Carter, Oklahoma, and settled in Elk City. He found that farmers of the region did not receive adequate medical care and had no affordable hospital. He called a meeting of his farmer patients and proposed a cooperatively owned clinic and hospital in Elk City. The Oklahoma Farmers' Union supported the measure and the hospital was opened by the Community Health Association, Inc., in August 1931. The reception from the medical community was icy. Although he had been a member of the Beckham County Medical Society for over 20 years, the society expelled him. The Oklahoma Board of Medical Examiners attempted to revoke Shadid's license, and the State Medical Association tried to get a bill passed against medical cooperatives in the Oklahoma Legislature. The bill was defeated with the help of the Oklahoma Farmers' Union. The American Medical Association (AMA) declared that his cooperative was unethical because it put laypersons in charge of business decisions. The union took control of the hospital and the health plan in 1934. By 1939, Community Hospital had served 15,000 farmers in southwestern Oklahoma. During the later years of his life, Shadid suffered from diabetes, resulting in the amputation of both legs. He traveled to Russia alone in a wheelchair to lecture on socialized medicine. Later life Shadid traveled throughout the United States and Europe and gave speeches advocating for cooperative health care. He helped launch a health co-op in Deer Park, Washington, and assisted the organizing committee that led to the formation of Group Health Cooperative. He helped found the Cooperative Health Federation of America in 1947. He served as the foundation's president from 1947 to 1949. In 1960, he built Hospital Haramoon in the Lebanese village where he was born. Shadid died in Kansas on August 13, 1966, and is buried in Oklahoma City at Fairlawn Cemetery.Huls, Glenna L.

It first opened for business on April 15, 1951, as \\"The New London-Waterford Speed Bowl\\", the track has been in continuous operation every season since it initially opened. It has continuously promoted Modified stock car racing as its featured division since its first year of operation. speedbowlhistory.com- Modified Champions It also holds family-oriented events such as the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday Series, Friday Show & Go drag racing and several Sunday Spectacular events throughout the year. Glastonbury businessman Bruce Bemer, won the track property via foreclosure auction bid in October 2014 after several seasons of financial struggles under former owner Terry Eames. Former track champion Shawn Monahan was named the track's new General Manager in February 2015. It formerly operated under NASCAR's Whelen All-American Series banner on Saturday nights. On April 6, 2017, NASCAR announced they ended their relationship with the New London-Waterford Speedbowl following the arrest of track owner Bruce Bemer for charges relating to sex trafficking. History  Original ownership group The New London-Waterford Speedbowl opened on April 15, 1951, as a 1/3 mile crushed blue stone oval race track. Its ownership group, The New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc., was composed of local businessmen: brothers Fred and Frank Benvenuti, Anthony Albino, Conrad Nassetta, William Hoffner and J. Lawrence Peters. John Whitehouse was the track's first Race Director, a position he held through most of the original ownership group's tenure into the early 1970s. Whitehouse lived in Florida during the winter and would then moved up north and stay in a house on the Speedbowl property during the racing season. The Speedbowl featured Modified stock car racing, called Sportsmen Stock cars at the time. The first event winner was Bob Swift. After 3 weeks of operation, the dust created during green flag segments of racing became a nuisance to spectators. The track closed for about a month and re-opened as an asphalt oval, which it remains today. speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review The one and only fatality as a result of injuries from an incident during a race occurred on August 1, 1954, when Jack Griffin's car flipped end-over-end approximately 10 times down the straightaway. The 41-year-old was transported to the local hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after 1am the following morning. His style of racecar, known as a \\"cut-down\\", was banned from the Speedbowl shortly thereafter for being too unsafe for competition. speedbowlhistory.com 1954 Year in Review In the coming years, the cut-downs were eventually banned throughout the northeast. Through the 1961 season, the track held events twice a week, on Saturdays and Wednesdays, featuring the same divisions, meaning each division ran twice a week earning points towards the championship. Since the 1962, the Speedbowl's primary weekly divisions have raced once a week on Saturdays speedbowlhistory.com 1962 Year in Review(although separate divisions and events have since been created over the years and compete exclusively on other days of the week) The operating Board of Directors had some turnover through the years. By 1960, Anthony Albino (now President) and Frank Benvenuti (Vice- President) were the only original owners still part of New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc. About a year later, local businessmen Jack Brouwer and Lou Esposito bought into the track as minority owners. By the early 1970s, the track ownership group consisted of Brouwer, Esposito and 2nd generation members Don Benvenuti and Bob Albino (who was the majority owner). Internal conflict would lead to the group selling the track after the 1974 season, after a 24-year run operating as The New-London Waterford Speedbowl Inc. speedbowlhistory.com 1974 Year in Review The first Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was NEAR Hall of Famer Dave Humphrey, speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review who also won the same title at the Seekonk Speedway that year, and would later win multiple titles in the Northeastern Midget Association (NEMA) later in his career. Midget Madness Other big stars during the track's early days were 2-time Champion Bill Slater, 5-time Champion Don Collins, 4-time Champion Charlie Webster, Moe Gherzi, Melvin \\"Red\\" Foote, Newt Palm and Ted Stack. speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions Harvey Tattersall Jr. buys Speedbowl Prior to the 1975 season, Harvey Tattersall Jr., long-time president of the United Stock Car Racing Association and one-time operator of the Riverside Park Speedway (among other tracks) bought the track from the previous ownership group. Tattersall had been one of the premiere racing promoters in the Northeast for two decades. His ownership tenure saw him as promoter and Race Director in the first few years, then he leased the track out for most of the later years. Tattersall revamped the structure of the supporting Late Model division when he took over in 1975, which was now called the Grand Americans. speedbowlhistory.com 1975 Year in Review During his reign, Tattersall would lease the track to Dick Williams on two occasions. First in 1978, speedbowlhistory.com 1978 Year in Review only for Tattersall take promoter duties back the following year, and then again in the early 1980s when Williams was actually operating four tracks at once, until focusing solely on the Waterford Speedbowl by the 1983 season Speedbowl Plans Purring on all 8-cylinders Both Tattersall and Williams served as both the promoter and Race Director during their respective operational control of the track. In 1983, legendary modified driver Ed Flemke became the Chief Steward at the Speedbowl, working with Dick Williams. speedbowlhistory.com 1983 Year in Review It was the last position in auto racing that Flemke held. He died during the following off-season. His position at the Speedbowl was not replaced. One of the more star-studded events during this time was the Yankee All-Star League events that ran at the track from 1975-1978. Winners of these events at Waterford included future NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stars Geoff Bodine, Ron Bouchard and Ken Bouchard, NASCAR National Modified Champions Carl \\"Bugsy\\" Stevens and Fred DeSarro and legendary Long Island, NY Modified driver Charlie Jarzombek. NASCAR Hall of Famer Richie Evans competed in these events and a few others at the Speedbowl during his career before his death in 1985. The Waterford Speedbowl, however, is one of the few tracks that Evans raced at without ever recording a victory. speedbowlhistory.com-Yankee All-Star League The NASCAR Stroh's Late Model tour, run by Tom Curley, made two appearances at the track in 1982 & 1983\\\\. Dave Dion won both events. Stars on the track during this time were 4-time Modified Champion Dick Dunn, Bob Potter, George \\"Moose\\" Hewitt speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions and Late Models racers Don Fowler, Bob Gada and Ron Cote speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions among others. Arute's 7A Productions By the end of the 1984 season, the track was enduring a tough time. The 1984 season was the only season which didn't have an end of the year banquet to celebrate its champions. But prior to the 1985 season, Tattersall leased the Speedbowl to the Arute family, who owned and operated the Stafford Motor Speedway in Stafford Springs. Two significant changes came during their reign as track operators: The headlining division was changed from the Modified division, to the upstart SK Modified division (at the time, the SK's were designed as a low-budget alternative to modified racing) and they also brought the NASCAR sanction to the track for the first time. The first SK Modified Champion at Waterford was future NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour Champion Rick Fuller, driving the Ted Marsh #55 car in 198 speedbowlhistory.com 1985 Year in Review The Arutes leased the track for 3 seasons, before leaving to once again focus solely on their family owned track in Stafford. Another star who blossomed during the mid-1980s was Late Model driver Phil Rondeau of Baltic, Connecticut. He won a record 6 Late Model Championships in an 8-year span (1985, 1987‚Äì89, 1991‚Äì92) and recorded over 100 victories during his career that lasted into the early 2000s at the track. Rondeau was considered one of the top short track Late Model drivers in the Northeast during his time at Waterford. Other stars on the track in the 1980s included C.J. Frye and Brian McCarthy in the Late Model division speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions and Rick Donnelly, Bob Potter, George \\"Moose\\" Hewitt and Dick Ceravolo in the Modifieds. Potter won 6 Championship between the Modified and SK Modified divisions in the 1970s & 1980's. Hewitt was a 5-time Modified Champion. speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions Korteweg's K Corporation In 1988, the Korteweg family took over track operations. Headed by father George and his sons Dan and Wayne, the Kortewegs invested a lot into track renovations, including the only repaving of the track's racing surface, new steel Armco barrier around the track, new catch fence and renovated restrooms and concession stands. A 3rd division was created in 1988 to support the SK Modified and Late Model divisions, called the Strictly Stocks - an entry level division of 8-cylinder stock cars. This division proved to be wildly popular. speedbowlhistory.com 1988 Year in Review The early 1990s brought some hurdles for the Korteweg family. Local residents complained in numbers about the noise the facility generated during its events. The track made it mandatory for all race cars to have mufflers in 1991. Waterford Getting an Earful Over Noise The town of Waterford did implement a noise ordinance in August 1993, but it excluded racing at the Speedbowl. Waterford is Left Out During July 1991, the Speedbowl was endanger of closing its doors for one of its big events on July 4 weekend, when then- Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker cut the state budget for non-essential jobs, including the DMV officials who regulated race events at all Connecticut tracks. Auto Racing Tracks Get Green Flag Less than 48 hours before the event, the state allowed DMV officials to the Speedbowl, however they would now be paid by the track directly. Connecticut's DMV would no longer have any governing power over the events at the Speedbowl, which remains the case today. Throughout the 90's, more divisions were created. In 1995, the Mini Stock division (a former enduro-type division that ran on Sundays) was revamped as the 4-cylinder alternative to the Strictly Stock class. speedbowlhistory.com 1995 Year in Review Legends car racing, truck divisions and several other enduro-type divisions were also run on Sundays and then Thursdays throughout the decade. Stars on the track during the 90's included Jerry Pearl, Dave Gada, Todd Ceravolo and future NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour Champion Ted Christopher in the SK Modified division; speedbowlhistory.com- Modified Champions Phil Rondeau, Jay Stuart, Tom Fox and future K&N; Pro Series East Champion Matt Kobyluck in the Late Model division; speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions Glen Boss, Ed Reed Jr., Ken Cassidy and Chris \\"Moose\\" Douton in the Strictly Stock division; speedbowlhistory.com- Street Stock Champions Jeff Miller, Dan Darnstaedt and Bruce Thomas in the Mini Stock division. speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions Terry Eames buys Speedbowl In 2000, Terry Eames, who was the Speedbowl's promoter since the Korteweg's left the track in the mid-90s, became owner/operator and secured the return of the NASCAR sanction which had been removed in the late 1980s. speedbowlhistory.com 2000 Year in Review In 2001, the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series debuted featuring the Legends Cars as the headlining division along with enduro-type cars called Super X (8-cylinder) and X-cars (4-cylinder) for a weekly summer series that is largely family oriented and still popular to this day.speedbowlhistory.com 2001 Year in Review It was around this time that the track was remeasured per NASCAR guidelines and officially declared a 0.375 (3/8) mile oval after a half-century of being recognized as a 0.333 (1/3) mile track. The dominate driver in the SK Modifieds during this time was Dennis Gada, who won a record 5 straight Championships from 1999-2003 including the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Series Northeast Regional title in 2003. NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Champions Celebrate Gada's 62 career SK wins at the track is also a record. During the early part of the decade the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour and NASCAR Busch North/East Series visited the track annually. However, by the mid-2000s the track was falling on hard times. In 2006, Washington Mutual Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against Eames. A year later, in late July 2007, a foreclosure auction was avoided when Connecticut businessmen Rocky Arbitell and Peter Borelli bought the note and refinanced with Eames directly. Washington Mutual Bank was now removed from the picture.Brakes on Waterford Speedbowl Foreclosure Eames continued as owner, but leased operational control of the track to Jerry Robinson of Mystic, Connecticut, for the 2007‚Äì08 seasons. Around this time, Harvey Industries bought 8 of the 39 acres from Eames and built a distribution center in what was the north end of the parking lot. Stars during the first decade of the 2000s included: Dennis Gada, Jeff Pearl, Ron Yuhas Jr. and Rob Janovic Jr. in the SK Modifieds; speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions Allen Coates, Corey Hutchings, Bruce Thomas Jr. and Tim Jordan in the Late Models speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions Ed Gertsch Jr., Dwayne Dorr, Walt Hovey Jr. and Al Stone III in the Street Stocks; speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions Danny Field, Phil Evans and Ken Cassidy Jr. in the Mini Stocks. speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions Regional Modified/SK Modified drivers who started out in the Speedbowl's Legends Car division during this time include James Civali, Chris Pasteryak, Mark Bakaj and Jeffrey Paul. New board of directors era In 2009, Terry Eames took back operational control of the track when Robinson's lease was not renewed.As the Speedbowl Management Turns Now the promoter once again, Eames formed a new Board of Directors which included former competitor and 2-time Speedbowl Champion Tom Fox as Race Director, former Mini Stock competitor Mark Caise and local supporter Brian Darling. The original group also featured former Street Stock Champion Shawn Monahan as a joint operator of the track Center Stage for Speedbowl and track historian Tom \\"Sid\\" DiMaggio in a multimedia capacity. However, by February 2009, Shawn Monahan resigned from his post sighting differences in the operational agreement with Eames and returned to racing shortly thereafter. Shawn Monahan Quickly Gone.. DiMaggio resigned 3 days later, although he continues as the track's active historian and part of the track's social media presence via his production company's video work.http://www.sidsview.com Fox would resign as Race Director after the 2010 season and Scott Tapley was named as his replacement at the 2010 awards banquet ceremony in January 2011. Shortly after the 2012 season ended, Tapley then resigned to take the Race Director position with the Valenti Modified Racing Series.http://www.racedayct.com/2012/11/scott-tapley- leaving-waterford-speedbowl-to-become-new-valenti-modified-racing-series-race- director/ Track owner & promoter Terry Eames took over the Race Director duties for the 2013 season, the first promoter to do so since Dick Williams in 1984. Former X-Car Champion Patrick Williams took over Race Director duties in 2014. In addition to the turnover with officials, the foreclosure issues were dragged out in the courts, with each season since 2006 ending with a cloud of doubt towards the facility's long-term future. The Speedbowl's current divisions are SK Modifieds, Late Models, SK Lights, Street Stocks and Mini Stocks. Legend Cars also compete sporadically throughout the Saturday season. The Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series continues to be a successful mid-week series during the summer that features Legends Cars and Bandoleros (for drivers as young as 6-years old), Super-X cars and X-cars and various \\"wacky\\" races throughout their season.

Ponce Ciudad Museo 2001. 2001. p. 57. Physical appearance The First United Methodist Church of Ponce is a magnificent example of early 20th-century eclecticism, integrating Neo-Gothic, Spanish Revival, Spanish Baroque, and byzantine elements. It is constructed entirely of rusticated, reinforced-concrete with gabled wood and corrugated sheet metal roofs. In volume, the church consists of a gabled single-nave, parallel to the street and subdivided into three sections. A large, central cross-gable creates the main facade at Calle Villa, facing north. On Calle Villa, the cross-gable is articulated by a Spanish-baroque style rope pediment. Flanking this gabled, central transept are two square-plan towers, a shorter turret on the west and a taller bell-tower on the east, both resting upon the intersections of the main nave and cross-gable. The main gable is divided into three bays: a wide, central bay with a large, wide, four-centered gothic arch stained-glass window and two flanking bays with similar but smaller and narrower stained-glass windows. Above the central bay, a stained glass Spanish-renaissance oculus (consisting of a square with semicircular projections at each of its four sides) occupies the area within the pediment. The east bell-tower consists of a two-story rusticated base and step-backs to an onion-shaped cupola above the belfry. At the ground level, an entry vestibule is created by an open, four-centered archway. At the second story, still within the tower's rusticated base-section, a series of four narrow, stained-glass strip windows provide a distinct, modernist, element. The first segment of the step-backs of the tower contains two smaller strip windows, and the following, taller set-back houses the church-bell behind narrow arches, one on each of the four sides, supported by Corinthian columns. The onion- cupola caps the composition. The smaller, west tower is completely rusticated and terminates in a rope pediment, at a level slightly lower than the base of the opposite tower. At the ground level there is a vestibule similar to that of the other tower and above, a circular opening with an oculus within. The main nave extends only one bay beyond the towers. These bays are identical to the smaller stained-glass bays of the main gable. A series of low buttresses supports all major walls, one at each extreme of. each wall. The side gables of the main nave repeat, exactly, the articulation of the facade of the main cross-gable. A rusticated concrete and wrought-iron gate surrounds the property, articulated by square pillars at approximately 20 foot intervals, and spanned by an approximately 2 foot high rusticated concrete base and bar- like wrought-iron railings above. Significance The Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Ponce is a very good example of Antonin Nechodoma's religious architecture. This Czech architect was one of the first non-Hispanic designers to work in Puerto Rico. A colleague of Frank Lloyd Wright under Louis Sullivan in Chicago, Nechodoma developed the Puerto Rican Bungalow style for residential housing, which spread rapidly throughout the Island during the 1920s and 1930s. Nechodoma was the architect of at least three Protestant churches and many magnificent prairie-style upper-class residences. Most of Nechodoma's buildings have been demolished because of later developments. Most of his surviving structures are now considered landmarks. Nechodoma designed his projects between 1907 and 1928. As the original plans of the church are dated 1907, historians believe that the Methodist Episcopal Church of Ponce was the first structure erected in Puerto Rico by the celebrated architect. The materials used to construct the church are of importance in the history of construction in Puerto Rico. Reinforced concrete, the principal material, was seldom, if at all, used at this early date in Puerto Rico. Contemporary concrete buildings exhibited a lack of understanding of the then-new material, evidenced by extremely thick walls and excessive use of iron beams (traditional means of construction were applied to modern materials). These characteristics are not found in the construction of this building. Nechodoma used the concrete in an elegant and even decorative fashion, demonstrating his knowledge of North-American construction techniques and his distance from the local building customs. The building looks as if it is made of stone and not concrete. This church is also important in Puerto Rico's religious history, as it was one of the first non-Roman Catholic churches built after the change of sovereignty in 1898, when the United States established rule. Until then, the only non-Catholic church allowed by Spanish colonial authorities to practice in Puerto Rico had been the Anglican church, organized by British residents. The Methodist Church is an example of the freedom of worship instated after the United States occupation of the island. State Historian Felix Julian del Campo and State Architectural Historian Hector F. Santiago consider it the most prominent non-Catholic structure in the city of Ponce.

Traditional versus behavioral clustering Traditional clustering Historically, retailers and manufacturers have grouped stores based on top-down constraints such as store size, total store sales volume, retail banner, or supply chain requirements to ensure the chain is operating efficiently. In other cases, a strategy to group stores into common demographic or geographic clusters is followed. The major benefit of using a top-down traditional approach is that, by using averages to group stores, it ensures the chain is operating at maximum efficiency. The risk when using this approach is in not meeting localized demand on a store-by-store basis, resulting in a potential loss in sales. Behavioral clustering When performing behavioral clustering, store clusters are formed based on analyzing the actual performance (e.g. sales dollars, units sold) of items, categories or departments, in every store within a network. This approach enables store groups to be created based on actual consumer buying behaviors. After placing each store in a cluster, individual consumer-centric strategies can then be created to facilitate targeted marketing, advertising, merchandising, pricing, and promotion plans. In addition, once store groups are formed, retailers and manufacturers are able to analyze the resulting store clusters to identify demographic, psychographic, or geographic similarities. For instance, analysis of one group of stores may highlight that they are all located in a similar geographic location (in the Northeast or near large population centers) or that a particular demographic similarity may exist i.e. a specific ethnic, age or income group may have a strong preference to a particular brand or style. This allows the retailer to determine which categories will be represented in the similar stores, how they will be marketed and promoted, and where they will be positioned and priced within the store. The major benefit of using a bottom-up behavioral clustering approach is that it enables the retailer to quickly identify clusters of stores with similar demand patterns, enabling them to develop truly customer-centric marketing, merchandising, space, and pricing strategies. The risk when using this approach is a potential loss in operational efficiency if too many clusters are established. The key to behavioral clustering is to find the right balance of localization to meet consumer demand while still maintaining operational efficiency.

Artistic practice  Bechrakis is a photographer, painter and video artist. Her work is based on performance art and investigates themes of gender, identity, private and public. Mostly known for her self-portrait photographs where the artist casts herself as protagonist in imaginary scripts and publicly performs private rituals and traditional female roles-often in exaggerated form. In her series ‚ÄúWithin-Without‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrange Weathers‚Äù she stages paradox scenes into public spaces which reverse stereotypical imagery resulting from advertising, films and the visual art tradition putting into question female identity in a humorous manner. At once the author of the image and the object of viewing, Bechrakis makes an ironic commentary of certain consumer and domestic patterns of behavior. She uses photography to construct imaginary, at times surrealist, environments that make reference to everyday life. Images that at first sight appear to be documenting a mundane reality, centering on the figure of a woman ‚Äì the artist herself ‚Äì challenge conventional restrictions and social taboos. Following in the footsteps of women performance artists of the 1980s, who consistently probed the boundaries between various manifestations of mass culture in art and lived experience, Bechrakis investigates throughout her work gender and identity issues, the relationship between the public and the private, real and fictitious space. Shifting between the art of performance, photography in its emancipated form, the composition of classical painting and a cinematic representation of reality, Bechrakis creates pictures that merge theatrical performances (tableaux-vivants) with a documentarian view, exploring the fine line between autobiography and fiction.

It was defined in 1992 by Aleksey Vsevolodovich Nikolayev, corresponding member Russian Academy of Sciences: \\"A tectonic or seismic weapon would be the use of the accumulated tectonic energy of the Earth's deeper layers to induce a destructive earthquake\\".927N0104A Moscow ZNANIYE-Sila (in Russian) No. 1, Jan 92 p2-13, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology, October 1992 He added \\"to set oneself the objective of inducing an earthquake is extremely doubtful\\".  Concept  Theoretically, the tectonic weapon functions by creating a powerful charge of elastic energy in the form of deformed volume of the Earth's crust in a region of tectonic activity. This then becomes an earthquake once triggered by a nuclear explosion in the epicenter or a vast electric pulse. As to the question of whether a nuclear explosion can trigger an earthquake, there was the analysis of local seismic recordings within a couple of miles of nuclear tests in the 1960s at Nevada that showed nuclear explosions caused some tectonic stress. The 1968 Faultless underground nuclear test caused faults to slip up to 40 km away. The United States Geological Survey stated that it produced fresh fault rupture some 1,200 meters long. There is also a theory that 1998 earthquake in Afghanistan was triggered by thermonuclear tests conducted in Indian and Pakistani test sites 2-20 days prior. Reports Roger Clark, lecturer in geophysics at Leeds University said in the respected journal Nature in 1996, responding to a newspaper report that there had been two secret Soviet programs, \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Volcano\\", aimed at developing a \\"tectonic weapon\\" that could set off earthquakes from great distance by manipulating electromagnetism, said \\"We don't think it is impossible, or wrong, but past experience suggests it is very unlikely\\". According to Nature these programs had been \\"unofficially known to Western geophysicists for several years\\". According to the story the Mercury program began in 1987, three tests were conducted in Kyrgyzstan, and Volcano's last test occurred in 1992.R Clark, Nature, 10 October 1996, quoted in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Jan 1997, In Brief section Such weapons, whether or not they exist or are feasible, are a source of concern in official circles. For example, US Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, said on 28 April 1997 at the Conference on Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy, University of Georgia, while discussing the dangers of false threats, \\"Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.\\" Federation of American Scientists: Address by US Secretary of State at 1997 conference on terrorism New Zealand's unsuccessful Project Seal programme during World War II attempted to create tsunami waves as a weapon. It was reported in 1999 that such a weapon might be viable. Nikola Tesla claimed a small steam-powered mechanical oscillator he was experimenting with in 1898 produced earthquake-like effects, but this has never been replicated. The television show MythBusters in Episode 60 .E2.80.93 made a small machine based on the same principle but powered by electricity rather than steam; it produced vibrations in a large structure detectable 100 feet away, but no significant shaking, and they judged the effect to be a busted myth. International treaties The 1978 Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques is an international treaty ratified by 75 states, and signed by a further 17, that prohibits use of environmental modification techniques to cause earthquakes and tsunamis, amongst other phenomena.US State Department: Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques Conspiracy theories After natural tectonic phenomena such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, conspiracy theories, usually relating to the armed forces of the United States and formerly the Soviet Union, often arise, though no evidence is advanced. After the Haiti earthquake it was widely reported that president Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela made unsupported allegations that it had been caused by testing of a US tectonic weapon.LiveScience: Chavez: US 'Tectonic Weapon' Caused Haiti Quake, 29 January 2010 The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda of Moscow reported on page 1 on 30 May 1992 that \\"a geophysical or tectonic weapon was actually developed in the USSR despite the UN Convention\\", but that Chief Seismologist Major- General V Bochrov of the USSR Ministry of Defence categorically rejected any hints on the existence of tectonic weapons.Komsomolskaya Pravda, 30 May 1992, p1, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology, 10 June 1992 \\"Earthquake bombs\\" While the British Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs of World War II were called earthquake bombs, the name came from their way of destroying very hardened targets by shaking their foundations as an earthquake would; they were never intended to cause an actual earthquake.

He currently works with DCTV and the Irish Mail On Sunday having just completed a radio documentary for RTE. Previously he worked for the Sunday Tribune and the Irish Independent.  Journalism  From 2013 to the present, Tyson has been a columnist and analyst with the Irish Daily Mail and Irish Mail On Sunday titles. Recently he exposed how Big Tech companies accept advertising for illegal products and fraudulent activities, only being legally obliged to take them down later, and campaigned for change via the upcoming Digital Services Act. In 2008 Tyson resigned from the Tribune over the immediate sacking of a fellow journalist following a complaint from a leading advertiser about one of his articles. In 2006, as correspondent for the Sunday Tribune he exposed a highly-controversial lend-to-invest spree at ACC Bank, which was followed by the resignation of ACC's CEO, receiving an \\"honourable mention\\" in the inaugural UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School Business Journalism Awards. Tyson won three ESB national media awards for journalism. Two of these (in 2000 and 2002) were for campaigning investigative journalism into the Irish Nationwide Building Society. In 2004, he won another ESB media award for stories on borrowers who were lured into unaffordable debts and subjected to aggressive repossession tactics.  TV  Late 2020 saw production begin on Romancing Ireland, a six part series on sustainable food production for DCTV funded by the Sound & Vision fund that challenges people from different nationalities to source Irish ingredients when preparing traditional meals from their respective countries with Tyson onboard in a producer role. Tyson, who has an MA in screenwriting, co-wrote and produced a four-hour television series for DCTV. The House From 2011 to 2013, Tyson was a reporter on the RT√â TV series The Consumer Show. Tyson exposed the dangers of detergent tabs to children sparking a D√°il debate and child-friendly improvements to safety practices. He has also highlighted the Payment Protection Insurance mis- selling controversy, following which widespread repayments were made by banks to thousands of consumers. He also exposed high mortgage rates charged at the time by Permanent tsb. These rates were reduced shortly after the issue was aired on the show. Two other documentaries produced by Tyson for DCTV with S&V; funding were A Century of Sailing, on the oldest sailing boats in the world still racing, and Little Jerusalem, a portrayal of a tiny Irish Jewish community, which has had an extraordinary impact on Irish Life.  Radio  In 2020 Tyson produced Nicolas Cruz Hernandez: Still Fighting a radio documentary about a Cuban who coached Ireland to Olympic boxing glory for RTE 1's highly regarded DocOn1 team. Tyson also recently produced Dearest Mother, a one hour radio documentary about World War I for Community Radio Youghal funded under the BAI's Sound & Vision scheme. Based on letters home from the front voiced by local actors, the production was inspired when a letter written by a granduncle he had never heard of was unexpectedly read out on an RTE radio history programme.  Film  The Tyson-produced short film \\"Whatever Turns You On\\" premiered at the Galway Film Fleadh and went on to win eight international awards including Best Short Short at Aspen Shortsfest USA 2009, an 'Oscar' qualifying event. In the same month it was short-listed for the award of Best Short Film at the Boston Irish Film Festival and received a theatrical release in Ireland and France. The short was also bought by TV stations in Poland, Ireland, Belgium, France and the UK. The year 2009 also saw the release of the short film Veronique ‚Äì penned and produced by Tyson ‚Äì under the Irish Film Board's Virtual Cinema scheme. Veronique was acquired by NBC Asia and screened in several countries with a potential audience of billions.  Books  Tyson wrote and published an annual finance book ‚Äì Your Money ‚Äì which was a top ten non-fiction best-seller several times between 1996 and 2004. In 2006, a biography of Mayoman Admiral William Brown written by well-known Argentine author Marcos Aguinis and translated by Bill Tyson was published to critical acclaim.  Other work  Through a voluntary group of media professionals, Community Media Associates, Tyson is a member of Dublin Community Television (DCTV) and was involved in a project to teach video production skills to disadvantaged youth in Drogheda in 2010. For the following three years he worked on two major EU media-related youth education projects: Happy Days and Digital Latin Quarter.

The surf smelt grows to be about 10 inches in southern waters, and 8 inches in northern waters near Canada. On average, surf smelt weigh about 10 to the pound. Spawning occurs in the nighttime, which is why it is sometimes called the night smelt, peaking in the months from May to October. With a maximum age of three to four years, some females will spawn at the age of one, and all will spawn at the age of two. Females lay from 1,500-30,000 sticky eggs in the surf zone per spawn, which they may do three to five or more times in a season. H. pretiosus feed on polychaete worms, larval fish and jellyfish, but they primarily feed on small crustaceans. They can be important parts of salmon and halibut diets, and are the most economically important fish among California smelts. Around 225,000 kilograms are harvested there every year.

The Museum opened on October 6, 1937, as one of numerous federal art centers established by the WPA during the Depression era. Only a handful of these centers are in operation today. In commemoration of the museum's opening, celebrated author and museum board member, Paul Horgan stated: \\"Civilization began when the materials of life were not only used, but understood‚Ä¶\\". Early museum exhibits included those traveled by the FAP; artifacts; paintings by Peter Hurd and Henriette Wyeth (daughter of N.C. Wyeth); and other regional archaeological and ethnographic objects. In the 1940s, the City of Roswell assumed control of the museum and a donor program brought in works by Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, Stuart Davis, John Marin, and others. Esther Goddard also gifted the museum with one of its most significant historical collections: Dr. Robert H. Goddard's material research on liquid-fuel rockets.

At the age of 23, he was recruited to work in the Soviet Union. Shortly after his arrival in Stalingrad, Robinson was racially assaulted by two white American workers, both of whom were subsequently arrested, tried and expelled from the Soviet Union with great publicity. Starting with a one-year contract to work in the Soviet Union, Robinson twice renewed his contract. After the publicity of his assault, he felt unable to return to the US and accepted Soviet citizenship. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering. His repeated attempts to visit outside the USSR finally resulted in an approved trip to Uganda in 1974, where he asked for and was given asylum. He married an African-American professor working there. He finally gained re-entry to the United States in 1986, and gained attention for his accounts of his 44 years in the Soviet Union. Life Born in Jamaica, Robinson moved with his parents to Cuba, where he grew up.Robinson; with Slevin: 31. He and his mother were abandoned by his father when he was six.Robinson; with Slevin: 31‚Äì32. His mother was born in Dominica and had gone to Jamaica while employed by a doctor. He and his mother emigrated to the United States and settled in Detroit. He went to local schools and became a skilled toolmaker at the Ford Motor Company during the expansive years in the auto industry. In 1929 Ford and the Soviet Union agreed to cooperate on a car plant in Gorky to turn out Model T cars.James Flanigan, \\"Soviets Failing a Lesson Taught by Henry Ford\\", Los Angeles Times, December 7, 1988. In 1930, a Russian delegation visited the Company, where Robinson worked as a toolmaker.Robinson; with Slevin: 26. The delegation leader offered him and others a one-year contract in the Soviet Union. The pay would be far greater. They were promised free rent in a grand apartment, maid service, and a car. At 23, fearing he could be laid off at any moment due to the effects of the Great Depression and the institutionalised racism in the United States, and taking into account that a cousin of a friend had recently been lynched in the South, Robinson accepted.Robinson; with Slevin: 28‚Äì29.  Soviet Union  He arrived in Stalingrad on July 4, 1930, to begin working in a tractor factory.Robinson; with Slevin: 59, 63, 75. The only African American among a contingent of workers from the United States, Robinson was beaten by two white American workers shortly after his arrival. After the incident the Soviet press turned him into a minor celebrity, publicising his case as an example of American racism. After his first year he renewed with another contract. After his second one-year contract expired in June 1932, Robinson went to Moscow to obtain a return ticket to the United States. Officials persuaded him to accept another one-year contract working at a ball-bearing factory.Robinson; with Slevin: 79‚Äì80. He was one of 362 \\"foreign specialists\\" at the plant when he started working there.Robinson; with Slevin: 80, 141 After the assassination of Sergei Mironovich Kirov, Stalin's assumed successor, on December 1, 1934, the preferred status of foreign specialists ended \\"overnight\\".Robinson; with Slevin: 87. In 1937, the US government ordered Robinson to return home or relinquish his citizenship. Robinson chose to stay in the Soviet Union due to the continuing depression and accepted Soviet citizenship although he later regretted this decision. He survived Stalin's Great Purge while many of his foreign acquaintances in Moscow vanished in 1936‚Äì1939. On June 22, 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Due to the nature of Soviet news reports, Robinson and others at his plant suspected that Soviet forces were suffering devastating losses.Robinson; with Slevin: 143‚Äì145. The Russians flocked to church that day, surprising Robinson, although after 24 years of Communist rule there were no priests to lead the congregation.Robinson; with Slevin: 145. Throughout the rest of the war, the government tolerated attendance to religious services. Robinson survived the German invasion of Russia, during which Hitler's army was stopped only from Moscow. During the war, he almost died of starvation, with some meals consisting of six or seven cabbage leaves soaked in lukewarm water. Despite the war, the Soviets arranged for continued education. According to his autobiography, in July 1944, Robinson graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, but did not receive his diploma until two years later.Robinson; with Slevin: 205‚Äì208. In 1947, he starred as a black American in a film about Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay. He also advised and acted in a Russian film production of the American racial drama Deep Are The Roots, (–ì–ª—É–±–æ–∫–∏ –∫–æ—Ä–Ω–∏).Robinson; with Slevin: 226‚Äì227.Erik Haagensen, \\"NY Review: 'Deep Are the Roots'\\", Backstage, March 13, 2012.  Return to the United States  After World War II, Robinson attempted to return to the US. He asked the singer and actor Paul Robeson, who had traveled to the Soviet Union, to help him leave the country. Robeson declined to do so as it would harm his relations with the Soviet leadership. Since the 1950s, Robinson had annually applied for a vacation visa abroad and each time, it was denied. Through the influence of two Ugandan ambassadors, Robinson was granted permission to visit Uganda in 1974. He bought a round-trip ticket so as not to arouse suspicion. Once there, he appealed for refuge, which was temporarily granted by Idi Amin. In 1976, Robinson married Zylpha Mapp, an African-American professor who was working at a university in Uganda. Through the efforts of Ugandan officials, and US Information Service officer William B. Davis, he was eventually allowed to re-enter the United States and re-gained United States citizenship in 1986. He lived in the US until his death in 1994. Following his return, he gave interviews about his insights into Soviet life from the inside, and was also featured in the Detroit Free Press. He was honored by the Ford Motor Company, 60 years after he began his work there. He moved to Washington, D.C. with his wife. After returning to the United States, Robinson wrote his autobiography, with the writer Jonathan Slevin. It was published as Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside The Soviet Union (1988). Robinson died of cancer in 1994. Among those attending the funeral were his wife, William B. Davis, and Mathias Lubega, former Ugandan ambassador to the Soviet Union.

A compact tension specimen (CT) is a type of standard notched specimen in accordance with ASTMASTM E647-00 Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fatigue Crack Growth Rates. ASTM International, 2000. and ISOISO 7539-6 Corrosion of metals and alloys - Stress corrosion testing - Part 6: Preparation and use of pre-cracked specimens for tests under constant load or constant displacement. 2nd Ed. 2003. standards. Compact tension specimens are used extensively in the area of fracture mechanics and corrosion testing, in order to establish fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth data for a material. The purpose of using a notched sample is to create a fatigue crack by applying cyclic loading through pins inserted into the holes on the sample using a laboratory fatigue test machine. The fatigue crack will begin on the point of the notch and extend through the sample. The length of the crack is typically monitored by measuring the compliance of the coupon which changes as the crack grows, or direct measurement using an optical microscope to measure the position of the crack tip or indirectly from either extensometer readings of the crack mouth opening or attaching strain gauges to the backface of the coupon. According to the standards, the constraining dimension of the specimen is the thickness of the material. Compact tension specimens are used for experiments where there is a shortage of material available due to their compact design. For rolled materials the notch should be aligned with the roll direction where the material is weakest. This will allow the user to insure that all results achieved are conservative (worst-case scenario).  Stress intensity factor  The stress intensity factor at the crack tip of a compact tension specimen is : K_{\\\\rm I} = \\\\frac{P}{B}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{W}}\\\\left[16.7\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{1/2} - 104.7\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{3/2} \\\\+ 369.9\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{5/2} - 573.8\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{7/2} + 360.5\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{9/2} \\\\right] where P is the applied load, B is the thickness of the specimen, a is the crack length, and W is the effective width of the specimen being the distance between the centreline of the holes and the backface of the coupon. The above equation has been fitted using numerical computations for various specimen geometries.  Crack length  The length of the crack is often measured indirectly during testing by calculating the crack length from the compliance of the coupon. The compliance can be determined from either a crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) gauge or from strain measurements on the back-face of the coupon. Crack mouth opening displacement Crack length can be found using a displacement gauge attached to the mouth of the coupon to measure displacements v using the equation : a/W = 1.0010 - 4.6695 {u_x} + 18.460 {u_x}^2 - 236.82 {u_x}^3 + 1214.9 {u_x}^4 - 2143.6 {u_x}^5 : u_x = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[\\\\frac{EvB}{P}\\\\right]^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} + 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}^{-1} This equation is applicable in the range 0.2 < a/W < 0.95.  Back-face strain  The crack length can be determined using the back-face strain \\\\varepsilon with the following equation : a/W = 1.0033 -2.35 U + 1.3694 U^2 - 15.294 U^3 + 63.182 U^4 -74.42 U^5 where U=1/(\\\\sqrt{A} + 1), A = E(\\\\varepsilon W)B/P and E is the Young's modulus of the coupon material. This equation is applicable in the range 0.2 < a/W < 0.95. Electric Potential Difference The crack length can also be determined from voltage measurements of the electric potential difference (EPD) at points at each side of the mouth of the machined slot at opposite sides of the coupon using : a/W = -0.5051 + 0.8857 (V/V_r) -0.1398 (V/V_r)^2 + 0.0002398 (V/V_r)^3 where V is the measured EPD voltage and V_r is the reference crack voltage corresponding to a/W=0.241. This equation is applicable in the range 0.24 < a/W < 0.7.

She is best known for her precise flow and poetic lyrics. Czarnik co-founded Hyperdrive Motivator Productions alongside producer Eric Mire, who is also her producer and performing partner. Since the release of Melissa Czarnik's (Zar-nik) first two albums, Strawberry Cadillac (2008) and Raspberry Jesus (2010), the emcee/poet/singer has received praise from NPR, Bitch, and Bust, among others and was listed as one of the top 50 Hip Hop Albums of 2010 on the Amoeblog. Being compared to the likes of Lauryn Hill, Cat Power and Saul Williams she has toured across the United States and Europe and has co-hosted radio specials such as Billy Jam's ‚ÄúWomen in Hip Hop Special (91.1, WFMU, NJ) which also featured Flipmode emcee Rah Digga, as well as co- hosted the hour long segment, ‚ÄúThe Musicality of Rap‚Äù on VoiceBox with Chloe Veltman (91.7, KALW, San Francisco). Czarnik continues to run her independent label, Hyperdrive Motivator Productions with producer Eric Mire, who is currently pursuing a Master's in Music Composition at New York University. Since 2007 the two have been releasing [hip-hop|hip-hop] music that is heavily influenced by jazz, classical, and spoken word. ‚ÄúHitting the heart, the mind and soul,‚Äù Czarnik states, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all I want, is to make feel-good vibe-music that all kinds of people can enjoy‚Ä¶ because that‚Äôs the type of music I enjoy.‚Äù Her live show can go from intimate confessions to hard hitting tracks packed with explosive energy. Whether performing with the five-piece Eric Mire Band or as a duo with Eric Mire on an upright piano and loop-pedal, the two have mesmerized audiences in France, Belgium, San Francisco, Portland, Chicago, and New York City among others. In 2012 Czarnik released her highly anticipated third album, Non Merci. The 13 track compilation fittingly received its title when Czarnik began planning to write and record at the Centre d‚ÄôArt Marnay Art Center (CAMAC), a 500-year-old French chateau turned artist residency 90 miles outside of Paris, France. The competitive residency hosts artists of all mediums from around the world with as many as 9 present at a time. From April 2 ‚Äì May 31, Czarnik worked across the Atlantic with the sole producer of the album, Eric Mire. For the first 46 days of the project Mire emailed Czarnik a beat per day until he joined her in France to begin recording. Non Merci takes listeners on a journey from poetic-hip hop to vulnerable singer-songwriter stylings. Czarnik mixes love, humor and sarcasm with intelligent commentary on society and politics. Differentiating from her first two albums, creating in France allowed her the opportunity to reflect on the world outside of her typical atmosphere. France seems to attract musicians, poets, writers, as we have witnessed with Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Ernest Hemingway and Quincy Jones seeking temporary refuge in the now socialist run state. ‚ÄúWorking in France allowed me to escape the pressures and stereotypes that often plague female artists in the U.S.‚Äù Czarnik stated, ‚ÄúThe distance and solitude allowed me to remain true to myself as I created.‚Äù The recognizable craft of Non Merci is found in Czarnik's flow: soft and peaceful, provocative and tempting, displaying a constant musicality throughout which is what makes her one of the most soulful and versatile emcees to emerge in recent years. Displaying the patience and intuition of a jazz singer, the instincts of a freestyle emcee and the thought provoking wordsmithings of a poet, Melissa Czarnik's Non Merci is expected to be the project that boosts her career to the next level. Live Show Her live show is an intimate look at Czarnik's personality. Mixing elements of jazz, hip hop and classical stylings she often performs with a backing band made-up of trumpet, piano, drums, djembe and bass.

He had been captain of the Cornelia Marie for more than 20 years at the time of his death. From 2004 and until his death, Harris and his boat were followed by an embedded film crew for the series Deadliest Catch. The Cornelia Marie was first shown during the opilio crab portion of Season 1, as partner ship of the F/V Maverick. The Cornelia Marie was heavily involved in search efforts for the Big Valley after it sank. It became a regular fixture of the show from the second season on. Harris was thrown from his bunk during a storm in the 2008 season, and thought he had broken his ribs. He spent several hours coughing up blood until his sons and crew finally convinced him to seek medical attention and enlisted the film crew to watch his condition. Doctors later determined that he had suffered a pulmonary embolism. Medical treatment for this condition prevented him from fishing for almost a year. He returned for the opilio crab fishing season in January 2009. Some of Harris's sea stories were included in the book Deadliest Catch: Desperate Hours. In 2008, Harris developed a line of coffees, \\"Captain's Reserve\\", with blends named after fishing themes such as \\"Harris Family Blend\\" and \\"Midnight Sunrise.\\"Captain's Brew company website Harris's chain-smoking, which was frequently seen on the show, added to his health woes. Death Captain Harris suffered a massive stroke during the sixth televised opilio crab season of Deadliest Catch. He was offloading crab on January 29, 2010 at St. Paul Island, Alaska. He was flown to Anchorage for surgery, and was placed in an induced coma to reduce intracranial pressure and swelling. He awoke from the coma after his condition improved. He was squeezing hands, talking, and showing other signs of improvement. Harris' doctors were amazed by his extreme improvement, saying that he was making gains in a few days that usually take months for stroke victims. However, Harris died from an intracranial hemorrhage on February 9, 2010. Captain Phil Harris was cremated, and half of the ashes were buried (in an ornately painted Harley Davidson motorcycle gas tank) with the remains of his mother. Harris' family spread the remainder of the ashes at sea. His sons Jacob and Joshua issued a statement from the Harris family, saying, \\"It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to our dad -- Captain Phil Harris. Dad has always been a fighter and continued to be until the end. For us and the crew, he was someone who never backed down. We will remember and celebrate that strength. Thanks to everyone for their thoughts and prayers.\\" The sixth season of Deadliest Catch featured footage of Phil Harris at work for the last time. The series began airing on the Discovery Channel on April 13, 2010. A memorial service to Phil Harris was hosted by the Discovery Channel along Seattle's waterfront on Smith Cove Cruise Terminal at Pier 91 on Friday evening, April 30, 2010. This was the night before the Puget Sound's annual Opening Day for boating season. Phil's sons Jake and Josh Harris spoke at this service. A boat gave a final salute from the location where Phil's vessel is based in Elliott Bay. Personal life Harris was single at the time of his death, but had been married and divorced twice. His first marriage, from 1982 to 1991 was to Mary Harris, mother of his two sons, Joshua and Jacob. Joshua and Jacob worked on board his fishing vessel, Cornelia Marie, as deckhands. His second marriage began January 22, 1992 and ended in divorce in 2006 to Teresa Harris. His hometown was Bothell, Washington. He enjoyed driving fast and owned both a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a Chevrolet Corvette. Besides driving fast and fishing, he also enjoyed building bird feeders. Before his death, Phil Harris set up a coffee company called the Captain's Reserve. His sons Jake and Joshua are now in the process of promoting the brand and expanding the family business. National retail expansion began January 2011, and went global the same year.

It is a Grade II* listed building which is now operating as a hotel. Built in the early 18th century, it was subsequently enlarged in 1901, when the original brick building was encased and extended as a three-storey Jacobean style country house, roughcast with stone dressings. On the north is a projecting hall range with a long gallery above. The east front has eight bays with a three-storey central porch. The west front has three bays and the courtyard front 15 bays, with a round arch entrance flanked by two two-storey towers with pyramidal roofs. The interior is decorated in the Arts and Crafts style with plasterwork by L A Turner and stained glass by Morris and Co. in the library. History Fanhams Hall is noteworthy for being the birthplace and home of the first Lord Croft, Sir Henry Page-Croft, who was the youngest son of Richard Benyon Croft (benefactor of Richard Hale School) and who was Winston Churchill's appointed Under-Secretary of State for War until 1945. The south-east wing of the house served as his living quarters, and the present- day bedrooms numbered 207-210 were Lord Croft's maisonette. In 1874, Fanhams Hall was also the birthplace and home of his sister, Anne, who later became the second wife of Liverpool Brewer Sir Charles Nall-Cain; they lived at Brocket Hall, Welwyn until Lord Brocket's death in 1934, when Lady Brocket returned to Fanhams Hall where she resided until her death in 1949. Earlier Joseph Farington RA visited his friends, Mr and Mrs Offley, at the hall. In 1828-33 it was rented by the first cousin of J.M.W.Turner RA, Charlotte Harpur, and her husband Dr Richard Jordan MD. The house was sold as a training centre to the Westminster Bank in 1951, to the Chartered Building Societies Institute in 1971, and to J Sainsbury plc in February 1986. Garden Lady Brocket's interest in horticulture influenced the employment of Japanese gardeners to create the Hall's formal gardens. Her ornamental lakes and choice of trees (such as Japanese maples) can still be seen in the present-day formal grounds, as can the \\"Fuji-yama Mound\\" which was built with earth from the Hall's lakes. The garden is listed grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Current use The Hall currently serves as a hotel and events venue, and is owned by the hotel group Exclusive Hotels and Venues. The Hall is still open to the public as a local meeting point. For example, the local branch of the Ancient Order of Foresters holds meetings within the grounds, and its buildings are also a location for political fundraising events within the town. Location Fanhams Hall is located in Ware, Hertfordshire.

She was skilled in the media of oil, pastel and watercolor. Her professional career was cut short by the Great Depression, but she still continued to paint well into her nineties with a passion for her craft and nature. She is noted for her plein-air painting while camping the American West and its National Parks. Early life in Chicago Mary Agnes Yerkes was born on August 9, 1886, in Oak Park, Illinois. Her parents, Charles Sherman Yerkes and Mary Greenlees Yerkes, had moved to their North Grove Avenue home a few years earlier from Ohio. She was the third child of four siblings; Reuben Archibald, Alice Agnew, and Charles Greenlees. Mary Agnes graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in 1906, and became an accomplished local artist. Her father died in 1908. In 1913, her mother commissioned a house, the Mary Greenlees Yerkes Residence from architect John S. Van Bergen. Van Bergen was a draftsman and then a contemporary of Frank Lloyd Wright. Where most architects catered to wealthy clients, Van Bergen showed a particular interest in designing for both career women and artists. Their home was specifically designed by Van Bergen with an upstairs art studio for Mary Agnes. He even designed some of the first floor's interior trim in to frame some of Mary Agnes' mural paintings. \\"After the Fire\\" by Mary Agnes Yerkes, 1915, pastel on canvas. The Mary Greenlees Yerkes Residence is an Oak Park Preservation Trust award recipient. The Art Institute of Chicago and listings within Oak Park directories show her living at this 450 Iowa address from 1913 to 1919. Her mother continued living with Mary Agnes until her death in California, in 1935. Yerkes took a two-year course in art history and decorative design at Rockford College. She then studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, where she also taught, and at the currently named School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She had special painting instruction under Wellington Reynolds, John W. Norton and Walter Marshall Clute, and participated in numerous exhibitions, including the exhibits of Chicago Artists, and the American Watercolor Society at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1912 to 1915. Yerkes had a solo two-week showing in October 1915, about which a Chicago critic wrote: California and the Depression \\"Mt. Diablo\\" by Mary Agnes Yerkes, circa 1920s, oil on canvas. \\"It was..California, and more specifically San Francisco, that became the first mecca for women artists in the West\\". In 1917, she married Navy Commander Archibald Nelson Offley, (Archie), and had one child, Mary Yerkes Offley, born in 1918 and who died at the age of 15 from nephritis. The early married life to a naval officer found her transferred to several ports: Portsmouth, Virginia, in the East, and San Diego, Vallejo, Long Beach, and San Francisco, along the coast of California. They eventually took up permanent residence in San Mateo, California, in the 1930s. This time period saw the onset of the Great Depression and she realized that a formal career in painting would be difficult: \\"The Great Depression of the 1930s and the consequent lack of funds to patronize art severely affected the careers of many artists, both men and women.\\" A few artists during this time were lucky to find jobs through the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in painting murals in public buildings, but for many artists their careers were crushed. This situation was confirmed by Yerkes' own journal, on one weekend's journey to San Francisco from San Mateo in 1935. Yerkes had an appointment with the art director of Gump's Department Store. She left very discouraged because the director said \\"nobody is buying art during these times\\". Their lifestyle was modest but far better than most during this period with Offley's secure position at the Office of Censorship in the Navy. Any free time and saved money went for putting gas in the car, to roam the countryside for her artistic exploration. Plein-air and the National Parks Mary Agnes plein-air painting at Carmel,\\" Carmel Beach, California, circa 1920s. \\"The two Yerkes oils in particular, [Crocker Art Museum], are wonderful examples of California Impressionism, and by a woman, which makes them even more rare.\\" . \\\\- Scott A. Shields, Ph.D., Associate Director/ Chief Curator, Crocker Art Museum. With Northern California as a permanent base, Yerkes now painted for herself. She had ready access to some of the West's greatest natural wonders. She traveled, camped and painted from Yosemite Valley to Santa Fe and from Tucson to Alberta, Canada. Travelogues, kept by her husband, showed detailed records of these adventures all throughout the 1930s and 40s. They toured in their specially modified 1920s Buick which was equipped with extra storage pockets and a canvas sling for an interior bed. Yerkes, her husband, and their daughter Mary, (nicknamed Min), spent weekends and holidays traveling on dirt roads to explore the inner sanctums of the newly established National Parks. Extended expeditions took them several times throughout the West and they toured many National Parks including; Crater Lake, Mt Rainier, Glacier, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Rainbow Bridge and Arches, Mesa Verde, Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Grand Canyon, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Yosemite, as well as the Oregon, Washington and California coasts. Yosemite Valley was a particular favorite subject matter and destination because of its beauty and proximity to San Mateo. Mary Agnes camping in Yosemite with their 1920s Buick,\\" Yosemite Valley, California, circa 1936. Yerkes mostly painted en plein-air but she also worked at home in a studio. Numerous photographs were taken by her on each trip to be used as reference later. Archie died in 1945 and Yerkes' painting efforts took a pause. They resumed in the 1950s with encouragement from her second partner, Albert Cobb, although she did not remarry. Yerkes continued to camp and paint the American West well into the 1970s and into her nineties. She also hooked pictorial rugs, wove fabric for her own clothes and accessories, and carved furniture in the same Southwestern and natural motifs she loved to paint. She died in San Mateo on November 8, 1989, at the age of 103. After decades of painting, over [150] of her paintings adorned her own walls at the time of her death. The art world knows her as \\"Mary Agnes\\" Yerkes but she, as well as her family members, used \\"Agnes\\".

History Bahnhofplatz with the Heiliggeistkirche in the background Following the destruction of the third city wall and the Christoffelturm in 1830-32, a plaza was opened up between the Burgerspital and Neuengasse. Initially the plaza was known as Kasernenplatz (Barracks Plaza) due to the neighboring cavalry barracks, though the name quickly changed to Spitalplatz (Hospital Plaza) due to the nearby Burgerspital. The plaza was the site of the cabbage market in Bern. In June 1857, the SCB (, or Swiss Central Train Line) completed a line between Basel and Bern.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 6,713, the second- largest in the county, following the nearby town of Kinderhook. Located on the east side of the Hudson River and 120 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, it was named for the river and its namesake explorer Henry Hudson. Hudson is the county seat of Columbia County. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and , or 7.38%, is water. Hudson is located 120 miles from New York Harbor, at the head of navigation on the Hudson River, on what originally was a spit of land jutting into the Hudson River between the South Bay and North Bay. Both bays have been largely filled in. Across the Hudson River lies the town of Athens in Greene County, New York; a ferry connected the two municipalities during much of the 19th century. Between them lies Middle Ground Flats, a former sandbar that grew due to both natural silting and also from dumping the spoils of dredging; today it is inhabited by deer and a few occupants of quasi-legal summer shanties. The Town of Greenport borders the other three sides of the city. Demographics Fire station in Hudson As of the census of 2010, there were 6,713 people, 2,766 households, and 1,368 families residing in the city. The population was estimated at 6,648 in 2013. These numbers include the approximately 360 residents of the local Hudson Correctional Facility. Population declines since the late 20th century may be attributable to demographic trends in which retirees, young couples, childless couples, singles, and weekenders have been gradually replacing larger families in the city. They have converted apartment buildings to single-family homes, and the number of unoccupied homes and rate of tax delinquency have declined. The population density was 3,110.8 inhabitants per square mile (1,201.8/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 59.0% (55.5% Non-Hispanic) White, 25.0% African American, 0.4% Native American, 7.1% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 5.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.2% of the population. There were 2,766 households, out of which 25.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 24.6% were married couples living together, 19.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.5% were non- families. 40.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 3.09. In the city, the population was spread out, with 22.5% under the age of 18, 9.8% from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 27.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.6 males. The median income for a household in the city was $35,117, and the median income for a family was $37,400. Males had a median income of $26,274 versus $22,598 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,353. About 23.0% of families and 23.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.8% of those under age 18 and 19.1% of those age 65 or over. History Hudson sesquicentennial commemorative half dollar was issued in 1935. It had one of the smallest mintages for a type issued by the US Mint. The native Mahican people had occupied this territory for hundreds of years before European encounter, preceded by thousands of years of indigenous cultures. Dutch colonists began to settle here in the 17th century, calling it \\"Claverack Landing\\", having other settlements in Manhattan and at Albany, downriver and up, respectively. In 1662 some Dutch bought this area of land from the Mahican. It was originally part of the Town of Claverack. After the English took over New Netherland, this area was settled largely by Quaker New England whalers and merchants hailing primarily from the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island. They capitalized on Hudson being at the head of navigation on the Hudson River and developed it as a busy port. Hudson was chartered as a city in 1785, soon after the United States achieved independence from Great Britain. The self- described \\"Proprietors\\" laid out a city grid. Hudson grew rapidly as an active port and came within one vote of being named by the state legislature as the capital of New York state, losing to Albany, an historic center of trade from the 17th century.Margaret B. Schram, Hudson's Merchants and Whalers: The Rise and Fall of a River Port, 1783-1850, Black Dome Printing, 2004 Hudson grew rapidly and by 1790 was the 24th-largest city in the United States. In 1820, it had a population of 5,310, and ranked as the fourth-largest city in New York, after New York City, Albany and Brooklyn. Construction of the Erie Canal in 1824 drew development west in the state, stimulating development of cities related to Great Lakes trade, such as Rochester and Buffalo, although the Hudson River continued to be important to commerce. During the 19th century, considerable industry was developed in Hudson, and the city became known as a factory town. It attracted new waves of immigrants and migrants to industrial jobs. Wealthy factory owners and merchants built fine houses in the Victorian period. Hudson obtained a new charter in 1895. It reached its peak of population in 1930, with 12,337 residents. In 1935, to celebrate the sesquicentennial of the city, the United States Mint issued the Hudson Half Dollar. The coin is one of the most rare ever minted by the United States Government, with only 10,008 coins struck. On the front of the coin is an image of Henry Hudson's ship the Half Moon, and on the reverse is the seal of the city. Local legend has it that coin was minted on the direct order of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to thank the Hudson City Democratic Committee for being the first to endorse him for state senator and governor. In the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Hudson became notorious as a center of vice, especially gambling and prostitution.Bruce Edward Hall, Diamond Street: The Story of the Little Town with the Big Red Light District, Black Dome Printing, 1994 (The former Diamond Street is today Columbia Street.) At the peak of the vice industry, Hudson boasted more than 50 bars. These rackets were mostly broken up in 1951, after surprise raids of Hudson brothels by New York state troopers under orders from Governor Thomas E. Dewey netted several local policemen, among other customers. Land use controversy From late 1998 until spring 2005, a land-use conflict took place when St. Lawrence Cement (SLC), a subsidiary of Swiss multinational Holderbank (since renamed Holcim), then one of the world's largest cement companies, proposed to build a cement-manufacturing plant. The massive coal- fired plant project would have occupied more than in the city of Hudson and the town of Greenport. Supporters cited the project for jobs and stimulating other growth. Sustained grassroots opposition to the project was led by business owner Peter JungPublic Broadcasting System (PBS), from Two Square Miles documentary: \\"Jung co-founded Friends of Hudson and served as president of the organization throughout most of its six-year battle with St. Lawrence Cement.\\" and journalist Sam Pratt,Public Broadcasting System (PBS): \\"Pratt is the devoted co-founder and executive director of Friends of Hudson, the grassroots organization that has helped score a series of against-the-odds environmental and political victories in the Hudson Valley, including the fight against the St. Lawrence Cement plant proposal.\\"The Independent newspaper (Hillsdale, NY): \\"Opposition leader Sam Pratt, executive director of Friends of Hudson, welcomed the decision.\\" NOTE: Newspaper is now defunct, but this article is archived at StopThePlant.com co-founders of Friends of Hudson (FOH).Detailed chronology of cement plant controversy, Stop the Plant website Opponents argued the proposed project violated state environmental regulations and would adversely affect the river, shoreline, and related habitats. The controversy gained national attention from news outlets such as CNN and The New York Times, as well as media outlets in Canada and Switzerland. The project was withdrawn after New York Secretary of State Randy Daniels determined that the company's plans were inconsistent with New York State's 24 coastal policies. Opponents of the cement project described the ruling as \\"a colossal relief\\" and supporters, including the Business Council of New York State, denounced it as \\"flawed in its logic\\". Nearly 14,000 public comments were received by the State's Division of Coastal Resources (87% of them opposed to the project), a record for that agency. Economy After a steep economic decline in the 1960s and '70s, following the loss of jobs due to restructuring in the manufacturing sector, the city has undergone a significant revival. The economy has shifted to one based on tourism, services and related retail. Attracted by its quality architecture, a group of antiques dealers opened shops on the city's main thoroughfare, Warren Street, in the mid-1980s. Among these were the Hudson Antiques Center, founded by Alain Pioton, and the English Antiques Center. In the early 21st century, the city has nearly seventy shops now, represented by the Hudson Antiques Dealers Association (HADA). The business revival stimulated tourism and attracted residents, some taking second homes in the city. It has become known for its active arts scene, restaurants, art galleries and nightlife, in addition to the antique shops.Smith, Gene. \\"America on the Hudson \\", American Heritage, April/May 2004. LGBTQ life In the early 21st century, Hudson has become a destination for LGBTQ people. Many have opened new businesses, moving here from larger urban areas, and have led the restoration of many of the city's historic houses. In 2010, Hudson High School made national history when openly gay seniors, Timothy Howard and Charlie Ferrusi, won prom king and queen. During the same year, Hudson hosted its first gay pride parade, which was attended by several hundred people. National Register of Historic Properties listings With hundreds of properties listed or eligible to be listed in the State and National registers of historic places, Hudson has been called the \\"finest dictionary of American architecture in New York State\\". The vast majority of properties listed within the Hudson Historic District are considered to be contributing, attesting to their quality.Byrne Fone, Historic Hudson: An Architectural Portrait, Black Dome Press, 2005 These properties include the Dr. Oliver Bronson House and Estate and Dr. Oliver Bronson House and Stables (both for Dr. Oliver Bronson), Henry A. and Evanlina Dubois House, Cornelius H.

It shows a wide selection of independent movies. A farmers market takes place on Saturdays, offering a variety of fresh organic products from the Hudson Valley area. The market is conducted outdoors in the warm season and indoor in the wintertime. Olde York Farm is a woman-owned and family-operated distillery sourcing Hudson Valley foraged and farmed ingredients to make seasonal batch spirits. The farm consists of land growing apples for apple based spirits, land for growing grain, and a black walnut tree grove on site at the distillery. The property is part of the historic Jacob Rutsen van Rensselaer House and Mill complex. Rensselaer also had his own distillery and cooperage circa 1805. Today the distillery and cooperage reside in Rensselaer's former carriage house. Barrels are handmade on site to age bourbon, whiskey, and brandy. On weekends, the tasting room is open serving cocktails, local beer, wine, cider, cheese plates, and gourmet grilled cheese. Many local restaurants purchase fresh meat, eggs, herbs, and produce from the nearby Letterbox Farm Collective. Government Hudson City Hall Hudson Area Library The city has a mayor-council form of elected government. Since the 1990s, seven mayors have served: William Allen, Dolly Allen, Richard Scalera, Kenneth Cranna, Richard Tracy, William Hallenbeck, Tiffany Martin Hamilton and Rick Rector. This period has been marked by unusual levels of friction between elected officials and residents, as the demographics and economics of the city have shifted. The Common Council consists of ten members elected from five districts, and a Council President elected citywide, as is the Treasurer.

RLP is one of the most common discomforts of pregnancy and usually starts at the second trimester of gestation and continues until delivery. It usually resolves completely after delivery although cases of postpartum RLP (that is, RLP that persisted for a few days after delivery) have been reported. RLP also occurs in nonpregnant women. The round ligament of the uterus goes from the pelvis, passes through the internal abdominal ring, and runs along the inguinal canal to the labia majora. It is the structure that holds the uterus suspended inside the abdominal cavity.Aguilera PA. (Pregnancy, Round Ligament Pain http://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-round-ligament-pain) WebMD. Retrieved 2010-01-25 There are at least 2 other round ligaments in the human body, the round ligament of the liver (ligamentum teres hepatis) and the round ligament of the head of the femur (ligamentum teres femoris). Symptoms The most common symptoms of RLP are: *Sudden pain in the lower abdomen, usually in the right side of the pelvic area that can extend to the groin. *Shooting abdominal pain when performing sudden movements or physical exercise. Pain is sudden, intermittent and lasts only for a few seconds. Causes The pathogenesis of RLP is varied. Although very common during pregnancy, non- gestating women can also experience RLP. The most common causes of RLP are as follows: *RLP may be caused by a spasm or cramp when the ligament contracts involuntarily. The ligament pulls on nerve fibers and sensitive structures of the female reproductive system. Since the uterus tends to be oriented towards the right side of the body, the pain is also often felt on the right side. This leads to frequent confusion with appendicitis. *During pregnancy, the uterus expands to accommodate the growing fetus. This increase in size and weight of the uterus puts stress on the ligament that holds it, causing it to stretch. During physical exertion or sudden movements, the ligament is overly stretched, causing pain. *Varicosities, e.g. enlargement of the blood vessels of the round ligament can occur during pregnancy, causing pain and swelling. The varicocoele starts at the veins draining the round ligament and the inguinal canal and is associated with engorgement of the veins of the ovaries and the pelvis during pregnancy. *Endometriosis that infiltrates or borders the uterine round ligament can cause RLP in fertile, non-gestating women. *Other pathologies that involve the uterine round ligament can cause RLP. Diagnosis Abdominal pains during pregnancy may be due to various pathologies. RLP is one of the most common and benign of these pains. However, diagnosis of RLP is problematic. Some of the conditions that may present symptoms similar to those of RLP are appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, kidney stones, urinary tract infection, uterine contractions, inguinal hernia, ovarian cysts, and endometriosis. If abdominal pain is continuous and accompanied by vaginal bleeding, excessive vaginal discharge, fever, chills, or vomiting, then it is most unlikely to be RLP and immediate consultation with a health care provider is warranted. Physical examination, ultrasonography, and blood and urine tests may be able to pinpoint the actual cause of abdominal pain. In some cases, however, RLP was only diagnosed during exploratory surgery. Case reports In many cases, RLP is confused with other conditions that cause abdominal pain. Described below are some problematic diagnoses related to RLP. ;RLP and appendicitis A 22-year-old pregnant woman presenting abdominal pains was initially diagnosed with RLP and was discharged. Subsequent symptoms and further tests revealed acute non- perforated appendicitis that required surgery. Appendectomy was successful but premature labor occurred 7 days after discharge, leading to spontaneous abortion. ;RLP and inguinal hernia Several cases of varicosity, of the round ligament during pregnancy leading to RLP have been reported although they were frequently misdiagnosed as inguinal hernia. In one case, a woman in the 28th week of gestation developed a lump in the left pubic area. The swelling was prominent when standing but not in the supine position and has a cough impulse. Ultrasonography revealed varicosities on the uterine round ligament. In another case, a woman at 22 weeks gestation was diagnosed with inguinal hernia and underwent surgery. Explorative surgery did not locate a hernia but revealed varicosities of the round ligament. Resection of the uterine ligament was successfully performed and no perinatal and postpartum complications were reported. ;Postpartum RLP Several cases of postpartum RLP have been reported. In one case, a 27-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain 24 hours after normal vaginal delivery. Another case was that of a 29-year-old woman who presented with RLP 3 days after delivery. In both cases, initial diagnosis was inguinal hernia. In the first case, emergency surgery did not locate any hernia but found the round ligament of the uterus to be edematous and filled with thrombosed varicose veins. The thrombosed part was excised and the patient recovered without sequelae. Another case report described a 37-year- old woman presenting with inguinal mass 6 days after normal vaginal delivery. CT and MRI revealed thrombosed blood vessels along the inguinal course of the uterine round ligament that extended towards the labia majora. ;RLP and endometriosis Several cases of inguinal endometriosis, that infiltrates the round ligament of the uterus have been reported in fertile, non-pregnant women. In the majority of these cases, diagnosis was problematic. In some cases, definitive diagnosis of round ligament endometriosis was only possible during exploratory surgery. ;RLP and myoma Cases of myoma-like growth occurring on the uterine round ligament have been reported. ;RLP and IVF Gonadotropin stimulation during in vitro fertilization can induce cyst development in certain parts of the female reproductive system. A case report documented the development of a mesothelial cyst on the uterine round ligament of a woman after IVF stimulation. Treatment  Once RLP has been diagnosed, there are many ways to reduce the pain without jeopardizing the pregnancy. *Analgesics. Acetaminophen or paracetamol is safe to take during pregnancy, thus is the most commonly prescribed pain reliever for pregnant women with RLP. *Heat application. Applying a hot compress to the area of pain may give some relief. Hot soaks and hot baths may also help. *Modifications in movements and position. Triggering factors that can cause RLP are sudden movements, (e.g. sitting up and down, standing up, sneezing, coughing), physical exertion, and long periods in the same resting position. A change in daily activities can help find relief and prevent worsening of the condition. Avoid sudden movements that can cause spasms of the ligament. When about to sneeze or cough, brace yourself by bending and flexing the hips to minimize the pull on the ligaments. *Rest. Resting is one of the best remedies against RLP. When lying down, changing position slowly and regularly is recommended. *Physical exercises Daily stretching exercise may be recommended by a gynecologist. An example of such an exercise is kneeling with hands and knees on the floor, then lowering your head to the floor, and keeping your bottom up in the air. The so-called pelvic (hip) tilt exercise also appears to help in reducing pain intensity and duration. *Surgery. In RLP pathologies involving endometriosis and ademyosis, surgery may be necessary to perform resection of the ligament or removal cysts and myoma.

It is historically associated with English common law, and contrasted with forced heirship, where part or all of the estate is automatically inherited by the next of kin. Opponents of absolute freedom of testation have pointed to the possibility of a widow or orphan being left destitute while property of a spouse or parent is bequeathed to others. Some opponents of inheritance tax have characterized it as an abrogation of freedom of testation. History After the Norman conquest of England, the Christian church succeeded in allowing a person to leave part of his property to the church to use them as funds for its activities. In law of the Republic of Ireland, the Succession Act 1965 reduces freedom of testation by guaranteeing provision for the spouse and children of the deceased.

He now works for the Global Cycling Network. Since rising to the top of the sport, Powers has been involved in many different media, developmental and education projects aimed at growing the popularity of cyclo-cross in the United States through the JAM Fund, his non-profit organization, Behind THE Barriers video production company, cyclocross camps, instructional DVDs and he has also collaborated on several cyclo-cross books including Skills Drills and Bellyaches and Mud Snow and Cyclocross.http://www.jpows.com Career Early career Born in Niantic, Connecticut, Powers' love of cycling was apparent from an early age as he loved to tear around the house on his BMX bike, and it wasn't long before he started turning heads at local mountain bike races. He soon found his way to the Team Devo junior mountain bike program and, with their support, he won his first major race in 2000, the Junior Mountain Bike World Cup in Napa Valley, California. Powers was introduced to cyclo-cross early in his cycling career as a way to stay fit at the end of the mountain bike season. It was the only time of the year when roadies and mountain bikers would converge in one place, and test each other's skills and fitness. In his native New England, cyclo-cross has been a regular part of each season for decades, and Powers excelled at the short, fast, technical races. Powers discovered that the frenetic pace and camaraderie of cyclo-cross suited his high energy and outgoing personality. Powers earned a reputation as a strong rider, and success in New England earned him an invite to the junior race at the 2001 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in the Czech Republic. In his first international cyclo-cross race, Powers finished in 17th place. Encouraged by several friends and his coach Adam Myerson, Powers moved to Massachusetts, and changed his focus to road racing; however, Powers achieved one of his most significant victories very early in his career, when he won the 2001 Mountain Bike World Cup Cross Country event in the Junior division in Napa Valley, California.

Overview Established as such in 1999, it includes the Clar√≠n newspaper (the most-widely circulated in Latin America), Papel Prensa (the nation's principal newsprint manufacturer), Cablevisi√≥n cable television, the Artear media company, and numerous other media outlets.Funding Universe: Grupo Clar√≠n Rooted in the successful 1945 launch of the centrist daily, Clar√≠n, by the late Roberto Noble, the group is active within the publishing, newspaper, television, radio, and telecommunications industries. Its largest shareholder is Ernestina Herrera de Noble. Other major shareholders include H√©ctor Magnetto, Jos√© Antonio Aranda, Lucio Rafael Pagliaro, and the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Magnetto is the President and CEO of the media group, while Ernestina Herrera de Noble directs the flagship Clar√≠n newspaper. Having become the largest newspaper distributor in the Spanish-speaking world by 1980 (when its revenues topped US$900 million), the group diversified itself significantly in 1990, when it entered into television sector with the acquisition of Channel 13, and into radio with the purchase of Radio Mitre. Following the expansion into cable television in 1992 (Multicanal), Todo Noticias, the group's cable news channel, was established in 1993 and remains one of the most influential in its sector. The conglomerate also controls Patagonik Film Group and numerous regional newspapers (notably Los Andes of Mendoza and La Voz del Interior of C√≥rdoba). Grupo Clar√≠n was listed in the Buenos Aires and London Stock Exchanges in 2007, upon which a 20% share in the group was made available to stockholders (leaving 9% for Goldman Sachs, and 71% for its private shareholders).Clar√≠n (22 Oct 2007) The group's revenues in 2011 were accounted for mainly by its cable television units (principally Cablevisi√≥n and Multicanal), which accounted for 46% of sales, and by advertising revenues (22%). Internet service provider Prima S.A. yielded 14% of total revenues, and the Group's numerous publishing interests netted 9% of the total; and rights to broadcasting, programming and digital content accounted for most of the remainder. Goldman Sachs sold its 9% share in the group to Fontinalis Partners equity fund CEO Ralph Booth in 2012. Amid ongoing controversies between Clar√≠n and Kirchnerism over a 2009 antitrust law that would limit the number of radio and television licenses held by the Clar√≠n Group, the Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services (AFSCA) enjoined the group on December 17, 2012, to divest itself of its majority stake in Cablevisi√≥n and of up to 213 broadcast licenses that would exceed the number stipulated by law; the 2009 Audiovisual Services Law allows companies to have 24 cable licenses and 10 free-to-air licenses for radio and television, and to cover no more than 35% of the pay-per-view population.  Debt default and political influence  One of Grupo Clar√≠n's holdings is the cable company Multicanal S.A. In the early 2000s, Multicanal defaulted on payments to holders of its Notes. According to U.S. Bankruptcy Court records, Grupo Clar√≠n made political moves that ultimately ended up hindering the ability of the Note holders from getting paid back.Gropper, Allan L., Judge. MEMORANDUM OF DECISION. UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. 2004-08-27. In 2002, Argentina was in a financial and economic crisis. Argentina's peso was tied to the value of the U.S. dollar, but in 2002 the government let the value of the peso float. As a result, the value of the peso went down 75% relative to the value of the U.S. dollar in just four months. Multicanal bought programming from the United States. The peso devaluation, along with the country's restrictions on access to U.S. dollars, made it expensive for Multicanal to purchase that programming. Multicanal also struggled to make interest payments on its approximately $509 million USD in debt. By April 2002, Multicanal defaulted on all of its payments to the holders of its Notes. When Multicanal went into bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, a group of investors and holders of Multicanal's Notes (a group referred to as \\"Huff\\"), filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Huff had filed cases in New York State Courts to try and get Multicanal to pay back those Notes, Multicanal had filed what is known as a ¬ß 304 petition because Multicanal does not want to have to pay Huff for its overdue payments on Notes. A new 2003 Argentina law, which Grupo Clar√≠n had successfully lobbied to pass, made it difficult for Huff and the holders of the Notes. The law limited how much stock in a communications company could be owned by people outside of Argentina. Huff later complained that the law gave Clarin and Multicanal and unfair advantage.

One of the oldest Bureau of Reclamation projects in the United States, the project involves a series of dams and canals intended to store, regulate and distribute the waters of the Snake, with electric power generation as a byproduct. The water irrigates more than a million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of otherwise arid land, producing much of Idaho's potato crop. Other crops include alfalfa, fruit and sugar beets. The primary irrigation district lies between Ashton in eastern Idaho and Bliss in the southwestern corner of the state. Five main reservoirs collect water, distributing it through of canals and of lateral distribution ditches. History Jackson Lake Dam Early studies for irrigation in southern Idaho began in 1889-90 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The data developed were made available to the Reclamation Service after the passage of the 1902 Reclamation Act. The Minidoka Project was established in 1904, with construction of Minidoka Dam starting the same year. Water could flow to the north bank of the Snake by gravity, but pumping was required for the south bank. The project was designed to combine flood control and impoundment of spring runoff for use later in the growing season. Jackson Lake and Palisades Reservoir are regulated to keep the flow at Heise, Idaho from exceeding . The Minidoka Project contributed to the settlement of the Snake River Plain and river valley, converting semi-arid land to productive farmland. Population rose from a few thousand people in 1915 to more than 200,000 by the 1980s. During the 1930s the project used labor provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps to construct canals. Later, during World War II, 10,000 Japanese-American internees were held at what is now Minidoka National Historic Site in Jerome County, Idaho. Internees worked on canal maintenance and provided agricultural labor. Population at the Minidoka camp declined to 6500 in 1944, before it was finally closed. The former CCC Camp BR-56 at Paul housed some of the internees in 1943, as well as 148 more internees moved from the Manzanar camp in California. Following the closure of the Minidoka camp, the facilities were used Veterans' Resettlement Program to house returning World War II veterans. Facilities Island Park Dam The project's dams and reservoirs comprise: * Jackson Lake Dam in Grand Teton National Park, which raises the elevation of the natural glacial Jackson Lake by , with a storage capacity of . * Grassy Lake Dam is located in Wyoming in Bridger-Teton National Forest between Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park, directly adjacent to the south boundary of Yellowstone. Built between 1935 and 1939, Grassy Lake Dam is high with a capacity of on Grassy Creek. Grassy Creek's flow was not sufficient to supply the reservoir reliably, so water from Cascade Creek was diverted by a dam and diversion canal long. The lands around Grassy Lake and Island Park Reservoirs are administered by the U.S. Forest Service. * Island Park Dam on the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, north of Ashton, Idaho. The dam has a storage capacity of . It was built at the same time as Grassy Lake Dam. Along with the Grassy Lake Reservoir, the Cross Cut diversion dam and the Cross Cut Canal, it forms the Upper Snake River Division of the Minidoka Project. The canal moves water from the Henrys Fork into the Teton River. American Falls Dam * American Falls Reservoir on the main branch of the Snake River, is the largest reservoir in the Minidoka Project, impounded by American Falls Dam. The original dam was built between 1925 and 1927, and was replaced between 1976 and 1978. Reservoir capacity is . Construction of the dam and reservoir required the relocation of most of the town of American Falls, with many existing structures relocated. * Lake Walcott, impounded by Minidoka Dam on the Snake. Minidoka Dam started construction in 1904 to provide irrigation and power. The lake has a capacity of . The power plant was one of the first to be installed in a Bureau of Reclamation project, providing power principally for pumping operations. Much of Lake Walcott is within Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge, providing habitat for waterfowl. The dam and powerplant are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The five main reservoirs are connected by a network of canals and pumping stations to regulate and distribute the water, supplying more than . Associated projects Grassy Lake Dam and reservoir Palisades Reservoir on the Snake in Idaho and Wyoming is operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, but is not part of the Minidoka Project. Operated as the separate Palisades Project, the zoned earthfill dam is operated in coordination with the Minidoka and Michaud Flats projects, storing and generating up to 176 megawatts of power. Palisades was built in the 1950s to address downstream water shortfalls. The Michaud Flats project serves with a pumping station on the left bank of the Snake, just below American Falls Dam, and 25 wells. The Teton Basin Project on the upper Teton River in eastern Idaho comprised the Teton Dam and reservoir. The dam failed on June 6, 1976 as the reservoir was being filled, leading to extensive flooding in the Minidoka project area.

Parker, the fifth in his Sunny Randall series. Plot summary The novel begins when Sunny Randall is approached by Buddy Bollen to provide protection for his number one client, Erin Flint. Ms. Flint is the star of the Woman Warrior movie series and future star of Bollen‚Äôs major league baseball team. Ms. Flint initially hates the idea of Sunny following her around but begrudgingly agrees to the arrangement at Buddy‚Äôs behest. Bollen‚Äôs fears seem to have been well founded when Erin‚Äôs assistant, Misty, is murdered. Because of Misty‚Äôs striking resemblance to her, Erin is convinced the killer was after her. Sunny meets Paradise Police Chief Jesse Stone at the scene of the crime; however Buddy and Erin lack confidence in the Paradise police, and ask Sunny to solve the crime. Sunny travels to L.A. where she meets her friend Tony Gault, a Hollywood agent with whom she has a casual sexual relationship. He puts her in touch with a sports writer who is convinced that Erin Flint‚Äôs addition to Buddy Bollen‚Äôs baseball team is a publicity stunt. It is his opinion that the baseball team was a bad buy on Bollen‚Äôs part because they have no market or fan base. Neither does he believe that Erin will be able to compete with the male players in the major league. He does think, however, that the publicity will generate enough interest in the team to allow Bollen to dump his bad investment. He proves to be right later when Erin faces a major league pitcher and cannot hit one ball. Next, Sunny contacts Chief Stone back in Paradise who puts her in contact with his old boss, LAPD police Captain Cronjager. After some investigation with the LAPD, Sunny discovers that Erin Flint is actually Ethel Boverini, and Misty Tyler was her sister Edith. She also discovers that Erin is still married to L.A. pimp Gerard Basgall. Sunny and an LAPD detective go to question Basgall who admits to still being married to Erin and still loving her. He also admits to visiting her regularly, and that his last visit was around the time Misty was murdered. Sunny flies back to Paradise, where she reveals this information to Chief Stone. Stone then confronts Erin with the information who breaks down, but later calms down and admits that she was one of Basgall‚Äôs prostitutes, as well as his wife. She and her sister began working for him after their mother died. Further investigation, and another trip to L.A. with Chief Stone this time, reveals more information. It turns out that Buddy Bollen was looking for financing for his first Woman Warrior movie. Meanwhile, Boston mobster Moon Monaghan had a lot of cash that he was looking to invest quietly. L.A. film financier Arlo Delany puts the two together. He also sweetens the deal by getting Buddy Bollen a sister combo of prostitutes to be at his beck and call. The girls also occasionally have sex with Moon Monaghan although Moon denies it when questioned. The girls turn out to be Erin Flint and Misty Tyler. Later, Buddy decides to star Erin in his Woman Warrior movie. The movie turns out to be a big hit; however Buddy has Arlo cook the books to make it look like it made no money in order to stiff Moon Monaghan. Moon gets wind of this and has Arlo killed as a warning to Buddy of what will happen if he doesn‚Äôt get his money back. Misty gets scared and threatens to go to the police. Erin calls Gerard to come out and talk some sense into her. They get into an argument and during the struggle he accidentally breaks Misty‚Äôs neck and kills her. Chief Stone and Sunny confront Erin and Gerard about this. Gerard claims that he killed Misty, while Erin claims that she killed her. Touched by the fact that the two try to protect the each other by taking the blame, Chief Stone decides they have suffered enough and lets them go on the condition that they promise not to avenge her.Parker, Robert B. (2006). Blue Screen. New York, New York: Berkley Books. Subplots A subplot involves Sunny's relationship with Jesse Stone. After meeting, the two start seeing each other. Jesse confides in Sunny that his ex-wife, with whom he had been trying to reconcile, had begun cheating on him again; this time sleeping with her station manager. Sunny has sex with Jesse, but then they decide to slow down. Sunny still has feelings for her ex-husband, Richie, even though he has remarried. However, Richie‚Äôs mobster uncle tells her that Richie‚Äôs wife is pregnant. After this revelation she finally realizes it is over between them and feels free to pursue her relationship with Jesse. Later, while investigating in L.A. she and Jesse have sex in a store fitting room on Rodeo drive. The two become closer and closer, and by the end of the novel confess their love for each other.

In June 2010 the UEFA Supervisory Board decided to approve the country's right to host European Football Championship 2012 in all four Ukrainian cities ‚Äì Kyiv, Donetsk, Lviv and Kharkiv, which Borys Kolesnikov commented as follows: \\"Ukraine may fear no more lest any of its cities was suspended from the list of European Football Championship 2012 hosting cities\\". Borys Kolesnikov's further work on Euro preparations was related to construction and reconstruction of Ukrainian stadiums and airports, and also development of infrastructure objects. According to Borys Kolesnikov, the total UEFA EURO preparation expenditure was about $5 bln. \\"We have built four international level airports in just 18 months. In Kyiv, we have completed the runway and constructed a new terminal. Fifty million euros have been used as operating costs, including for specialist services such as translators, personnel recruitment and training\\", Borys Kolesnikov said in his interview to an Italian newspaper. UEFA President and Executive Committee thanked the Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine Borys Kolesnikov for the excellent organization of EURO 2012 in Ukraine. \\"This EURO was a spectacular success at every level.

The event attracted foreigners to a previously unknown country, which will help develop tourism business in the future. According to the Research & Branding Group survey, nearly two-thirds of Ukrainians were positively impressed with the championship. Three-quarters of Ukrainians believe that their country hosted EURO 2012 at a high level, and only 12 percent think otherwise.http://www.interfax.com.ua/rus/main/111892/ Opinions: \\"Every time I come to Borys Kolesnikov‚Äôs office I see all constructions displayed on the monitor of his PC, and he follows them online\\", said Mr. Tigipko, adding also that he highly estimates efforts made by Mr. Kolesnikov when preparing Ukraine for the European Championship. \\"It‚Äôs very good we keep up with the UEFA schedules, and we fulfil the obligations undertaken, implementation of which had been seriously threatened before. I think it is a personal credit of Borys Kolesnikov, since he is the man actively managing the matters of Euro 2012\\", stated Serhiy Tihipko. For quick paces of construction and reconstruction of stadiums and airports UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino called him Super-Borys. According to Kommentari paper ‚ÄúAfter the Euro 2012 Kolesnikov may become the most popular ‚Äòwhite-and-blue‚Äô politician. Depending on how successfully will be Euro 2012 hosted in Ukraine, the whole activity of Borys Kolesnikov, the Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure, will be evaluated for the whole period of his office in the Cabinet of Ministers‚Äù.

Railway Talking about reforming of Ukrainian Railway at the summary press conference \\"Summing up results of the first half of the year. Development plan of the branch.\\", Borys Kolesnikov defined three priorities. \\"First is to forget night train travelling in six years: any location in Ukraine will be reached during a day. And that thanks to new trains again. Second is traffic electrification (‚ÄúOut of 22,000 kilometres of railroads only a half was electrified, we must increase this figure to 15,000‚Äù). Third is locomotive fleet modernization: we still use out-of-date Soviet Fleet\\". To implement the plans being shaped, to make high-speed train connection between Kyiv and Ukrainian cities hosting the Euro 2012, at the end of December 2010 a contract was signed with Hyundai Corporation under which Ukrainian Railway obtains 10 new multi-region electric trains. Moreover, first six trains will allow express traffic between Kyiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Lviv. For instance, one will be able to get to Kharkiv in 3.5 hrs, Lviv in 4.5 hrs, Donetsk in 5.5‚Äì6 hrs.

It was named \\"Hospital Civil\\" to differentiate it from the original structure built with funds from Mr. Valentin's will. Ermelindo Salazar, Bartolo Mayol, and Francisco Maria Franceschi, headed a drive for the collection of popular funds to build the new annex, but enough funds were collected to build just one wing of the annex. Construction of the entire annex structure did not complete until 1896.Socorro Gir√≥n. Ponce, el teatro La Perla y La Campana de la Almudaina. Historia de Ponce desde sus comienzos hasta la segunda d√©cada del siglo XIX. Ponce, Puerto Rico: Gobierno Municipal de Ponce. 1992. page 208. By 1885 the municipality had completed a one-story neoclassical style structure that covered an entire urban block. This building remained unchanged until the 1918 earthquake which damaged part of the southern side. The reconstruction of this side was completed in 1928. During this reconstruction a second story was added to the south side. The architectural vocabulary used for this addition was similar to the 1885 construction. The first floor and main entrance were restored to their original shape. Since then alterations to the structure have been minimal and mostly due to new regulations by the Department of Health or to serve the community better. The main alteration to the structure was the addition of a new emergency entrance on the southern side on the Bertoly Street facade. The addition did not contribute to the value of the property but neither did it hinder the structure's architectural integrity since it was designed and built with a compatible architectural facade. This was also true of the 1928 second floor, which was clearly separated from the 1885 construction by means of visually acceptable wall. Hospital Tricoche served the Ponce community since 1878. \\"In its 121-year history the hospital gave the best free-of-cost medical attention available to the poor and needy in the city of Ponce.\\"Mariano G.

In 1972 the Municipality adopted a resolution to rebuild the hospital but, after additional consideration, the plan was abandoned in 1974 in favor of building a new facility away from congestion and with sufficient space for parking.Carmelo Rosario Natal.

Between the mid 1970s and early 1980s, a new hospital facility was built on Avenida Las Americas. Once built, however, the municipal government could not appropriate the necessary funds to equip and open its new hospital building and, in 1984, agreed to sell the new facility to the Hospital Dr. Pila corporation for $10.37 million, which moved into the new facilities three years later.Carmelo Rosario Natal.

May 14, 1986. The oldest records found indicate that the structure was built in 1885 consisting of a one-story building organized around two identical anterior courtyards. This original spatial distribution is still preserved today. The southern half was altered in 1928 after the 1918 earthquake damaged part of this side. During this remodeling a second story was added to this half. This southern facade is set back from the street by a fence and front yard. Its main element is the entrance portico articulated by flat tuscan pilasters and three arches, the central one slightly protruding to the front (This portico is part of the original 1885 construction). Over the portico, separated by cornice and parapet with the building's name in sans serif letters. Other decorative elements at this level include overhangs, a segmental round cornice over the recessed center window, louvered casement windows with segmental round openings and plain glass transoms and a rosette on top of the center recess between the two volumes. In contrast, the first floor of this south facade presents large rectangular windows with wide planar moldings and a simple cornice with a segmental pyramidal profile on the top molding, a cornice and rectangular windows with false segmental arch crowned by an equally false keystone all part of the original 1885 construction. The rear half of the building conserves the original one-story configuration with a repetition of rectangular openings surrounded by wide planar moldings and top cornices. Crowning the center bay of the north (Calle Arenas) facade there is a simple triangular pediment with the date \\"1885\\" on top. The Calle Arenas street facade presents a certain rhythm in its treatment of pilasters and bays: two pilasters flank each of the central ones, including the one with the pediment, are flanked and separated by a total of six more pilasters. Wherever the pilasters occur on this facade, the wall is slightly set off to the front. The bottom of this rear part is lifted on a podium and the pilasters are surmounted by an entablure with a very simple frieze and architrave.Mariano G.

After a recent remodeling, most windows and doors were finished in near-duplicative (usually louvered casement) designs. The new annex on the side features arched openings to the street and has glass fenestration. This addition does not contribute to the property's architectural value but due to its disposition and volume it does not harm the main structure's integrity either.

Early career Born in Chicago, Reizner started off as a singer and recorded a 7-track EP of classic cowboy songs entitled 'Chante Cow-Boy' for the French label Le Chant Du Monde, before going to work for Mercury Records. He produced Dick Campbell's debut album Dick Campbell Sings Where Its At in 1965, using Mike Bloomfield and The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, who had previously backed Bob Dylan, to give a Dylanesque sound. Reizner was a keen talent spotter, and moved to England in 1966 where he produced Big Jim Sullivan.[ Allmusic Biography of Lou Reizner by Bruce Eder] Retrieved 10 February 2010 He gave the Greek Rock band Aphrodite's Child their name. He signed and produced The Eyes of Blue, introducing them to Quincy Jones and collaborated with them on the soundtrack of the film \\"The Toy Grabbers\\" (released in the US as \\"Mother\\"). He also arranged for the Eyes to score the music to, and appear in, the film \\"Connecting Rooms\\", and used them as a backing band, when, having signed Buzzy Linhart, he produced his album Buzzy in 1968. The same year, he produced the Buddy Miles Express debut album Expressway to Your Skull. In October 1968 he signed Rod Stewart to his first solo contract and produced his first two albums An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down (called The Rod Stewart Album in the US) and Gasoline Alley. He signed Smile (a precursor to Queen) and was executive producer on their 1969 recordings, although, other than a US single \\"Earth\\" they were not released until 1998, long after his death. He also signed Van der Graaf Generator to Mercury Records in 1968, and arranged a US contract for David Bowie. He even co-wrote, sang on and produced two tracks for the film The Italian Job (another Quincy Jones film), which were issued as a single in 1969. In 1970 he signed Strawberry Dust and co-produced their album Women and Children First with John Weathers, renaming the band Ancient Grease for the album release. The album and band failed but the band later evolved into Racing Cars. Reizner's output was extremely varied. In 1971 he produced Brazilian Tropicalismo artist Caetano Veloso's third self-titled album (his 1971 album or A Little More Blue); Third of a Lifetime by hard rock band Three Man Army; Wishful Thinking's album Hiroshima and its title song \\"Hiroshima\\",[ Allmusic review of Hiroshima by Stewart Mason] Retrieved 10 February 2010 (which became a hit for Sandra in Germany in 1990), and Dave Morgan's solo album Morgan.

The album was launched at a live performance on 9 December 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, London, with The LSO, The ECC, The Who and an all star cast. This, \\"the orchestrated Tommy was to be Lou's crowning achievement\\". The double album was issued in a lavish box set, with a full colour booklet including the story, the lyrics and illustrations of the cast in character, \\"which was at the time the most elaborate album package yet created\\", and which won the Best Album Package Grammy in 1974. Whilst still producing hard rock bands such as Three Man Army, Reizner also continued his symphonic rock work, with Rick Wakeman's concept album Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Issued in 1974, this also featured the LSO and the ECC, conducted by Measham and arranged by Malone. Film soundtracks The success of these extravagant productions encouraged him to work on the soundtrack to All This and World War II, a 1976 film comprising 20th Century Fox World War II newsreels, set to Beatles songs, re-recorded by current artists such as The Bee Gees, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Peter Gabriel. Although the film fared badly, the soundtrack album charted in the UK and US. The album included Elton John's version of \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\", which had been issued in 1974, and Rod Stewart's version of \\"Get Back\\" which became a UK hit single. The film also includes a Will Malone & Reizner cover of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\". Reizner went on to produce the music to the 1977 film Black Joy featuring Gladys Knight and the Pips, Aretha Franklin, The Drifters and The O'Jays. He was still working prolifically, when he died of colon cancer, in June 1977.

It has over 350 members from several European countries. The association organizes a European conference every two years, and ‚Äî in joint action with the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas (CSSSA)http://computationalsocialscience.org/ and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences (PAAA)http://www.paaa.asia/ ‚Äî a World Congress on Social Simulation (WCSS)http://www.paaa.asia/wcss/ every other year.  History  The European Social Simulation Association was founded in 2003 on the basis of a manifesto signed by many social simulation researchers.Moss, S. et al. (2002) 'A European Social Simulation Association' Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 5 (3) 9 . h ttp://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/5/3/9.html These founding members also drafted a constitution which forms the basis of ESSA's constitution. ESSA grew up fast, now it counts about 370 members, who elect their President and the Management Committee members every two years. So far, six Presidents have been taking turns, Scott Moss, Nigel Gilbert, Wander Jager, Rosaria Conte, Andreas Ernst and Flaminio Squazzoni. The ESSA initial community, however, is active since at least 1992, when the first of a series of symposia on Simulating Societies (SimSoc) was organized by Nigel Gilbert at the University of Surrey, in Surrey, UK. The same community gave rise to several initiatives including the SimSochttps://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi- bin/webadmin?A0=simsoc network on the Internet. In 1998, some of the later founders joined in a consortium, the main purpose of which at that time was the editing of a new scientific journal, JASSS (Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation). JASSS is now the main forum for scientific publications in the field of agent-based social simulation. The following events ‚Äî the two Conferences on Computer Simulation and the Social Sciences (ICCS&SS; I and II) held respectively in 1997 and in 2000 ‚Äî which were also organized from within the European community rose up to a more international level. They set the ground for the series of World Congress on Social Simulation (WCSS), which started in Tokyo in 2001. At the same time, a series of workshops on Multi Agent Based Simulation (MABS)http://www.pcs.usp.br/~mabs/ was launched at the 3rd ICMAS conference in 1998, bridging the social simulation to the MAS community. This and the Special Interest Group on Agent Based Social Simulation,http://www.agentlink.org/activities/sigs/sig4.html which was active during the European Network of Excellence AgentLinkhttp://www.agentlink.org/index.php I and II within the fourth and fifth frameworks of the European projects, greatly contributed to consolidate both the interdisciplinary and the international dimension of the field. From 2003 to 2009, ESSA conferences has been organized on a yearly base. Since 2010, ESSA Conferences take place every second year, alternating with WCSS.  Association's goals  ESSA's objectives are to: * Encourage the development of social simulation in Europe and more widely. * Promote international cooperation among those working in the field while recognizing the distinctiveness of European social simulation research. * Promote and support the development of European post-graduate courses and qualifications in social simulation. * Liaise with other groups. * Support and organize regular regional and international conferences.  Main topics of interest  As is exemplified by the ESSA Special Interest Groups, the community is mainly focused on market dynamics, policy, social conflict and social simulation (SCSS), societal transitions. Three main typologies of simulation models have been developed so far within the European community. First, simulation studies of stylised social scenarios have been carried out for the purpose of abstract theoretical modelling, e.g.: * cooperation and coordination; * emergent phenomena; * social and economic exchange and reciprocity; * conventions and social norms; * opinion dynamics. Second, case studies which present a special interest have been simulated, e.g.: * innovation networks; * climate forecast; * land use analysis. Third, relevant issues in given application domains are explored by means of simulation modelling; examples abound: * properties of social networks; * resource management; * organization management and design; * reputation systems; * management of emergencies (both anthropogenic and natural); * monitoring/predicting the dynamics of crime and terrorism; * checking the effect of demographic trends; * checking the speed and width of social contagion.

After signing with Urbe Tevere in 1982, he went on to play for several other Italian clubs, starting his professional footballing career with A.C. Cesena in 1983, remaining with the club until 1986, also spending two seasons on loan with Ravenna (1984‚Äì85, and 1985‚Äì86). He moved to Arezzo for a season in 1987, before moving to Genoa in 1988. During his time with Genoa (1988‚Äì99), he notably won the 1988‚Äì89 Serie B title, helping the club to obtain Serie A promotion, and also winning the 1995‚Äì96 Anglo-Italian Cup; he was also sent on loan to various clubs during his time with Genoa: Brescia (1989 and 1994‚Äì95), Fiorentina (1989‚Äì91), Udinese (1991‚Äì92), and SPAL (1992‚Äì93). He ended his career in 2006, after a season with U.S.D. Sestri Levante 1919. During his time with Fiorentina, he played alongside Roberto Baggio and also Stefano Borgonovo, helping the club to reach the 1990 UEFA Cup Final, where they were defeated by rivals Juventus. Following his retirement, he worked as a coach. Style of play A quick, mobile, and creative forward, with an eye for goal, Nappi was known for his long blond hair, as well as his determination and work-rate on the pitch, and was capable of playing in several offensive positions. A skilful player, he was also known for his control, agility, flair and technical ability, as well as his notable use of tricks and feints to beat opponents when dribbling, such as the sombrero; one of his most famous gestures was his use of the seal dribble, which earned him the nickname foca (seal). His most famous use of the seal dribble came in the first leg of the semi-final of the 1989‚Äì90 UEFA Cup, against Werder Bremen; during the match, Nappi picked up the ball in his area and ran 20 metres with the ball bouncing along his forehead along the right flank. After retirement Nappi served as a pundit for Telenord following his retirement. A good friend of former footballer and ex-Fiorentina team-mate Stefano Borgonovo, Nappi organised the Genoa-Sampdoria derby \\"United against ALS\\" in his honour on 27 March 2009, at the Luigi Ferraris stadium in Genoa, scoring from a penalty. Coaching career In 2007, Nappi began a career as a youth coach for Figenpa, a Genoan amateur side. In the summer of 2012, he returned to his former club Savona (with whom he had played from 2002 to 2003) as a coach for the \\"Allievi Nazionali\\" youth side, reaching the \\"finali nazionali\\" with the youth side.

Different genres of games have different styles and options of unlockable content that is standard among their games. The unlockable content varies, and can be as little as a single weapon or enhancement, to more than doubling the playable characters available to the player. Methods Presale exclusives Many games, such as Left 4 Dead 2 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2, offer presales that come with exclusive unlockable content. In order to get these exclusives, one must order the game through the retailer before it is available for sale, with a small deposit to guarantee the game. Once this presale is made, the buyer gets a code to use to get the unlockable content once the game is available. This has been done by many companies worldwide, such as North America's GameStop,http://gamestop.com/ UK's Gamehttp://www.game.co.uk/ and many other retailers. Achievements Some games have established replayability for players through a rewards system. Once the player does unique or difficult actions in a game, such as killing a boss in a limited time, or collecting a certain number of items over the course of playing the game, the player can earn a reward, potentially unlocking more content, such as additional items for the player to use or vanity items to show the player's prowess at achievements. This extended into a form of metagame with the release of the Xbox 360. The system included a \\"Achievement System\\" by which certain in-game achievements would be recognised and rewarded with an \\"achievement\\"‚Äîa small image and description of the achievement, along with a score value, which is added to the user's total Achievement Score and displayed on their profile. This was followed up by the PlayStation 3 and Steam PC video game distribution system who patched in PlayStation Trophies and Steam Achievements systems, respectively, and the continuance of these systems in the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. The metagame focuses on \\"completing\\" a game by collecting all of its Achievements/Trophies. While Steam's metagame is limited by its lack of overarching counter, part of the metagame on PlayStation and Xbox is increasing your overall score by collecting Achievements/Trophies in multiple games. These Achievements/Trophies can be given for story/level progression, difficulty level, completing a number of actions, completing a difficult action, and more. These Achievements/Trophies need not be connected to any in- game reward. Companies such as Ubisoft have released programs and systems that take advantage of this metagame, by rewarding players who complete certain actions with points. These points, known in Ubisoft's Uplay service as \\"U\\" points, can be redeemed for in-game rewards such as additional in-game currency, character skins, missions, weapons, and the like. Defeating bosses Especially with fighting games, defeating certain bosses or villains can unlock those characters, or other non-starting characters, as playable characters for the player. Games like Tekken and Soulcalibur offer such methods of unlocking content. Internet usage Sometimes, the only action necessary to unlock new content is Internet availability. Games like Professor Layton and the Curious Village offered players additional puzzles every week by downloading the puzzles from the Internet over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection available in all the Nintendo DS handhelds. Hidden items Sometimes a player can unlock content by collecting hidden items found throughout the game. Some games offer a purchase system of additional content, such as images, wallpapers, music and such, great example is the .hack video game series, by collecting the hidden items and redeeming them for the unlockable content. Sometimes the player can get these unlockables based on the total amount of hidden items found.

He served a total of 34 years on the Christchurch City Council. Biography Early life and career Manning was born in Gowerton, Wales, on 11 February 1887. He was the son of Richard Manning (a steel worker) and Sarah Davies. Aged 12 he won a scholarship to attend Gowerton School, but he left after 15 months in order to enter work. At age 14 he became a steel worker like his father. In 1907 he attended his first union meeting at a local pub and joined both the General Labourers' Union and Independent Labour Party. beginning a lifetime association with the labour movement. Together with a friend he emigrated to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1910. He said many years later that the working conditions were hard for contemporary workers to believe and frequently said that if there was one \\"black spot\\" on the history of Great Britain it would be the working conditions of the nineteenth century. His first job upon arrival was at the New Zealand Railways Department shoveling coal. Shortly afterwards he entered the employment of the local drainage board digging ditches. He was then taken on by the Government Life Insurance Office for a three-month probationary period as an insurance officer before being offered a position with the Christchurch Tramway Board in 1911 as a conductor on the Sumner line. He then joined the Tramway Workers' Union. He married Scottish-born Sarah Edith Willmore at the Trinity Congregational Church, Christchurch Central City, on 11 October 1923. He was involved in a multitude of clubs and community groups including the Cambrian Society, the board of governors of the University of Canterbury, the Adult Cerebral Palsy Society (of which he was a life member and patron) and the Victory Park Board. Local politics Manning stood unsuccessfully for Christchurch City Council in 1917 and 1919 as a Labour Party candidate. In 1920, he got offered a position as organising secretary of the Canterbury Workers' Educational Association (WEA) on the condition that he abstained from political office. This restriction was lifted in 1925. He served WEA from February 1921 to 1948, and a room at the WEA building in Gloucester Street is dedicated to Manning. Through WEA classes he took a degree course at University of Canterbury and eventually earned a Master of Arts majoring in economics. He was elected onto Christchurch City Council in 1927 and served one term until 1929. He was again successful in a 1936 by-election and served a continuous 32 years, first as councillor (until 1958) and then mayor. In 1945, there was an undertaking to widen Burnside Road that connected the city with the aerodrome in Harewood and dedicate it as a memorial to fallen airmen. As Burwood Road was located outside of the city boundary, being the responsibility of Waimairi and Paparua county councils, Manning opposed the city council financing much of the proposal, but the scheme went ahead and the road is today known as Memorial Avenue. He also served as a member of the Christchurch Transport Board from 1937 to 1951 (including ten years as chairman) and was also a member of the Lyttelton Harbour Board for several terms. Mayor of Christchurch Manning served as Deputy Mayor from 1950 to 1958, and was elected as Mayor in 1958. In 1959 he was re-elected as mayor despite not a single Labour councillor being returned alongside him. This was interpreted as a testament to Manning's personal popularity which came to be regarded as above party politics despite a lifelong affiliation with Labour. In 1966 he led a delegation to bid for the hosting rights for the 1970 Commonwealth Games which, while unsuccessful, laid the groundwork for Christchurch being awarded the 1974 Commonwealth Games. In the 1968 election, he did not stand as a candidate again, but was re-elected to the Lyttelton Harbour Board for one final term before retiring. In the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours, Manning was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for services to education and local government. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1967 Queen's Birthday Honours, for public services, especially to education and local government. National politics Manning stood for the Labour Party in the 1943 election in the Christchurch North electorate, but lost against Sidney Holland. He was also set to stand there in the cancelled 1941 general election. He stood as a candidate for the Labour nomination for the 1947 Avon by-election, but lost to John Mathison. He then contested the St Albans electorate in the 1949 election, but was unsuccessful against Jack Watts. Later life and death For his contributions to adult education, the University of Canterbury awarded him an honorary doctorate (LLD) in 1972. From 1973 onwards Manning was mostly restricted to a private hospital as a result of failing health. He died in Christchurch on 29 December 1976, survived by his wife and their son Penrhy. His wife died in 1998.

In 1971, BAPA hired its first paid full-time staff, focusing its efforts on housing, schools and economic development. At a time when many south side communities were targeted by unscrupulous real estate agents using blockbusting tactics that fueled white flight and rapid resegregation of communities, BAPA's staff and volunteers facilitated successful integration and increasing home values by encouraging diversity, promoting the neighborhood, and fostering business investment along the commercial strips. BAPA's program areas address housing, economic development, and schools, but also focus on other elements that make the Village in the City prosper: safety, historic preservation, city services, transportation, marketing, and fostering community spirit through a variety of special events. The Beverly Area Planning Association hosts several annual events, including the Beverly Hills/Morgan Park Home Tour, showcasing significant private residences on the third Sunday of May; the Ridge Run, one of Chicago's oldest and most popular neighborhood races offering a 10K run, 5K run/walk, and 1 mile youth run on Memorial Day; the Beverly Hills Cycling Classic, first race in the International Cycling Classic Superweek Pro Tour, held on the second Friday of July; Music Under the Stars, an outdoor family concert and fireworks show held on the first Sunday of August; and the History Mystery Bike Tour, a family biking event through the historic district held in October.

Club career Born in Treviso, Buso initially began his career playing as a striker or as a centre-forward with Juventus in Serie A in 1985, at the age of 16, immediately winning the 1985‚Äì86 Serie A title and the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, although he was mainly a reserve player at the club, behind forwards Aldo Serena, Ian Rush, and Alessandro Altobelli. He later moved to Fiorentina in 1989, where he was deployed alongside Roberto Baggio and Oscar Dertycia as a winger, or as a supporting striker. During his time at the club, he played and scored in the 1990 UEFA Cup Final against his former team, although Fiorentina would lose the tournament. He subsequently moved to Sampdoria in 1991, where he won the 1991 Supercoppa Italiana. He began to be deployed as a midfielder as his career progressed, and he later also played for Napoli (1993‚Äì1996), Lazio (1996‚Äì97), Piacenza (1997‚Äì2000), Cagliari (2000‚Äì01), ending his career with La Spezia in Serie C1 (2001‚Äì04).

Written by Easdale in the mid-1980s, \\"Anything, Anything\\" features a steady beat and lyrics about the breakdown of his marriage. Although initially unsuccessful, the song saw commercial success after being played on KROQ and featuring on the A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master soundtrack. \\"Anything, Anything\\" remains one of the band's most famous songs and is a live favorite. Background \\"Anything, Anything (I'll Give You)\\" was written by Dramarama singer John Easdale in the period from 1984 to 1985, a time he recalled as \\"definitely not a high point in [his] life.\\" The song was written as a reflection on Easdale's deteriorating marriage. Lyrically, the references to drinking and pills were intended to reference partying, with the latter being used to rhyme with \\"one-hundred dollar bills.\\" The song features the same beat throughout, a feature Easdale explains was meant as \\"a way to keep the anguish constant.\\" Release Dramarama were largely unknown until Los Angeles DJ Rodney Bingenheimer began regularly playing \\"Anything, Anything\\" on KROQ. The song garnered phone requests and was added to the station's rotation shortly thereafter. The success prompted Dramarama to move to Los Angeles; the track remains one of the most requested songs in the history of Los Angeles radio station KROQ. Easdale later described the song's success as a \\"miracle.\\" Music video Two versions of the \\"Anything, Anything\\" music video were ultimately released. The first version, featuring clips of Edie Sedgwick from the underground 1972 film, Ciao! Manhattan interspersed with the clips of the band, was initially rejected by MTV due to the use word \\"pills\\" (which the band later rerecorded as \\"chills\\"). A second video was filmed in 1990 to accompany a re-released single by Chameleon Records. Reception and legacy \\"Anything, Anything\\" remains one of the band's most popular songs. Easdale reflected on this, \\"I love that people I have never met know the song. I love hearing strangers perform cover versions. I love that it is still getting played on the radio, on the internet and elsewhere. I love that I still get to sing it and that people still come to hear us play it in concert. I love that 30 plus years later, outlets like NOISEY are asking me questions about it. I have written many, many songs, but it is the only one that has really had a life of its own.\\" The song remains a live favorite for the band; according to Easdale, \\"It's a fun song to play, the crowd more often than not sings along, the best is when the audience is singing louder than me. 'Anything, Anything' is the only song that has consistently been performed at nearly all Dramarama live shows since 1985.\\" The single was featured on the A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master soundtrack. A short clip of it was also featured in an episode of Entourage. Since 2009 the song has been the name and title of Rich Russo's free form radio show Anything Anything with Rich Russo where the song opens the show each week. The song also features in the 2014 film Two Night Stand, as well as the 2003 film 11:14. American talk show host Ellen DeGeneres has said it is her favorite song. For DeGeneres' 50th birthday, Ellen DeGeneres Show DJ Stryker surprised her by bringing Dramarama to the show to perform the song live.

He has written music for orchestra, wind ensemble, chorus and chamber formations. His music often combines computer music and live performance. Biography Mark Engebretson (b. 1964) is Professor of Composition and Electronic Music at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He is the recipient of a North Carolina Artist Fellowship in Composition (for the Concerto for Soprano Saxophone and Orchestra), a Fulbright Fellowship for studies in France, and has received major commissions from Harvard University‚Äôs Fromm Music Foundation (Acrylic Waves), the University of Wisconsin-Madison (They Said: sinister resonance), the Thomas S. Kenan Center for the Arts (Deliriade) and the Barlow Foundation. Current compositional projects include a new work commissioned by the Greensboro Symphony for the 60th birthday celebration of renowned violinist and conductor Dmitry Sitkovetsky. Performers who have championed his music include the Oasis, Vienna and Red Clay Saxophone Quartets, Due East, saxophonists Susan Fancher, James Romain, Steve Stusek, Jonathan Helton and Paul Bro, violinists Dmitry Sitkovetsky and Marjorie Bagley, trombonist Mark Hetzler and flutist Tadeu Coelho. Other significant performances have been given by the Orquestra Sinf√¥nica da Universidade da S√£o Paulo, the Cleveland Winds, the Wroclaw Philharmonic Orchestra and the Greensboro Opera. Engebretson is the founder and director of the UNCG New Music Festival (2003‚Äìpresent), and has had performances of his works at SEAMUS, ICMC, Wien Modern, Third Practice, Festival of New American Music, ISCM, BGSU Festival of New Music and Art, Carnegie Hall, Sala S√£o Paulo, Argentina, Albania, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, China, across America and throughout Europe. Over twenty of his compositions are recorded on the Albany, Innova, Lotus, Parma/Navona and Mark labels. Mark Engebretson taught composition at the University of Florida, music theory at SUNY Fredonia and 20th-century music history at the Eastman School of Music. He studied at the University of Minnesota (graduating summa cum laude), the Conservatoire de Bordeaux and Northwestern University, where he received the Doctor of Music degree. At Northwestern he studied composition with M. William Karlins, Pauline Oliveros, Marta Ptaszynska, Michael Pisaro, Stephen Syverud and Jay Alan Yim and saxophone with Frederick Hemke. His teachers in France were Michel Fuste-Lambezat and Jean-Marie Londeix. www.markengebretson.com Music As a composer his influences include Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Paul Lanski, Steve Reich, and Iannis Xenakis. Eric Stokes introduced him to experimental music and found sound (i.e. found object art using sounds as its material).[1] Engebretson has received commissions from Harvard University‚Äôs Fromm Music Foundation (2007) and the Thomas S. Kenan Center for the Arts (2008). His compositions have been performed at Indiana State University New Music Festival (Terre Haute, Indiana) and International Society for Contemporary Music Festivals (Tirana, Albania and Baku, Azerbaijan) as well as contemporary music festivals such as Wien Modern (Vienna), Gaida Festival (Vilnius, Lithuania), Ny Musikk (Bergen, Norway) and the Florida Electroacoustic Music Festival. The world premiere of SaxMax was given at the 14th World Saxophone Congress in Ljubljana, Slovenia by James Romain.[2] Melody, timbre, virtuosity, clear and balanced formal structure, the integration of new media, multiple levels of associations, and a desire for fresh, engaging expression all drive his creative work. In this case, the concept of melody can be interpreted quite broadly: a melody could be a singing, arcing line, a single tone with constant microtonal or timbre changes, a jumping, jagged, asymmetrical riff, or a lick played on a snare drum. A fascination with both performance and compositional virtuosity joins melody to form the basis of his ongoing interest in writing works that push my boundaries as a composer and that engage superstar performers in technical and musical challenges. Engebretson's view is that such works teach us something about music, endless possibilities, and ourselves. References * 1. Moore, Tom (3 October 2008). \\"Tom Moore Interviews Mark Engebretson\\".

They were caused by a freak storm in the Hindu Kush mountains. Officials: Afghan avalanches kill 157 people Leading up to the disaster About 250 avalanches annually strike the road. During the 2008/9 season, the total loss of life in Afghanistan due to avalanche was about 40 people. On 7 February 2010, the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) reported that 10 people were killed in Kandahar Province. Najibullah Barith, ARCS's director in Kandahar complained about the lack of local and national resources. A spokesman of the Afghanistan National Disasters Management Authority said that 11 people were killed by avalanches in Farah, Bamyan, Ghor, and Daykundi provinces between 4 and 8 February. The Afghan flash floods and avalanches left 20 others dead in the rest of the country on 8 February. The provincial authorities had summoned an emergency meeting and Loya Jurga to discuss responses on 8 February. Shah Wali Kot and Shorandam districts were the worst affected. Avalanches Mountain passes of Afghanistan A sudden blizzard struck the area shortly before the disaster, closing the tunnel and the roads around it on both sides of the tunnel. Heavy wind and rain in the area just before the incident caused up to 17 avalanches that buried at least of roadway in the Salang Tunnel, trapping thousands of people in their vehicles who were travelling in the tunnel. This also cut off one of the major travel links to Northern Afghanistan. Official reports soon after the avalanche report up to 64 people were feared dead and that more could die. Afghanistan's interior minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar believed that there could be at least 2,500 people trapped in their vehicles.Avalanches Kill Dozens on Mountain Highway in Afghanistan Many vehicles were pushed down the mountains, and hundreds of cars were buried in snow. Among the survivors many injuries were reported. The tunnel was reopened on 12 February 2010. Rescue Army medical personnel tending to a wounded survivor at Bagram Airfield The Afghan National Army was forming the main backbone of the recovery effort with at least 500 troops sent to the area as well as two helicopters and several bulldozers. NATO International Security Assistance Force forces also gave their support providing four Chinook helicopters, as well as using helicopters to drop food and medical supplies to those trapped in their vehicles. The injured had been taken to Charikar Hospital in Parwan Province, and the more seriously injured had been taken to Bagram Airfield where they received more advanced medical treatment from coalition doctors.Officials: Afghan avalanches may have killed over 60 Beside the direct injuries from the avalanche, there was also the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning inside the poorly ventilated tunnel, while the traffic was stalled for a long time. By 10 February, about 2,500 people had been rescued, but it was feared that more people were still buried in their snow-trapped vehicles. Criticism Institutional authorities including the National Meteorology Authority (NMA) came under criticism for allowing the disaster to unfold. Although heavy snowfall had been forecast in the Salang area and structural walls had been weakened in previous avalanches, the pass was not closed and no preparations had been put in place. Officials point out that Afghanistan lacks the resources and infrastructure for the prevention and management of natural disasters and relies to some degree upon help by the UN and international forces.

He is currently the offensive coordinator at Parsippany High School in Parsippany, New Jersey, a position he has held since 2013. Gallagher served as the head coach at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania from 1986 to 1988 and at William Paterson University from 1989 to 1996, compiling a career college football record of 44‚Äì64‚Äì1. A native of Morris County, New Jersey, Gallagher attended Morris Catholic High School, where he graduated in 1969. He then attended William Paterson University to play football for the school's first ever team. Gallagher would score the first two touchdowns in the program's history. Gallagher began his coaching career at Morris Catholic High School, where he served as an assistant coach from 1973 to 1976. In 1977, he became the new head coach and held that position until 1983. Gallagher's first college football coaching job was spent at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania for the 1984 and 1985 seasons as an offensive coordinator, followed by three years at Saint Francis and eight at William Paterson. Since 1997 he has coached at Montville High School in New Jersey and in 2006 guided the Montville Mustangs to the State Championship Game at Giants Stadium. Through the 2009 college football season, Gallagher is the only William Paterson coach to guide his team to any playoff appearances. In 1991, William Paterson made it to the first round of the ECAC playoffs, and in 1993 they made it to the second round of the NCAA Division III playoffs. In 2015, Coach Gallagher began coaching the defensive backs at the Delbarton School, in Morristown, New Jersey. He was named Special Teams Coordinator at Delbarton in 2016. In addition, Gallagher was inducted into the New Jersey Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2011 following him being Coach Of The Year in 2006. Offensive philosophy Gallagher has, throughout his coaching career, been a strong adherent to the Delaware Wing-T system. It relies heavily on misdirection and motion to confuse the opposing defense while their linebackers are trying to make reads. Gallagher has experienced varying levels of success with this system throughout his career as the system demands a lot from the offensive linemen. Their abilities to hold blocks, pull with speed and to remember their assignments which are often given in pairs or threes for each play. Gallagher saw the most success with this system most recently in the 2006 football system, where his Montville team matched up against West Essex High School in then-Giants Stadium for the Group 3 State Championship, where he does coached athletes such as John Gauweiler, Mike Todisco, and Chris Collins.

Background Seanchan Torpest was the Chief Poet of Connacht c.645 AD when he succeeded Dall√°n Forgaill as Chief Ollam of Ireland. He died in 647 AD. His father was Cuairfheartaigh from the Araidh sept on the northern Tipperary-Limerick border. Sench√°n gives his own pedigree in his genealogical work called the Concangab M√°r which he composed about 630. It states- Sench√°n, son of √öarchride, son of Ad√≥er, of the Araid.'Three Old Irish Accentual Poems', by James Carney in √âriu Journal, Vol. 22 (1971), p.73 Senchan's mother's name was Dediva (also called Editua or Dedi or Deidi or Deighe or Deidiu or Deaga or Mediva), daughter of Tren, son of Dubhthach moccu Lughair, who was also a previous Chief Ollam of Ireland and royal poet of King L√≥egaire mac N√©ill. Dediva's other children were Saint Senan of Laraghabrine, son of Fintan, Saint Diarmaid the Just, son of Lugna, Saint Felim of Kilmore son of Carill, Saint Daigh of Inniskeen son of Carill, Saint Femia, daughter of Carill, St.Mainch√≠n of Corann, son of Collan of Corann and Saint Caillin, son of Niata, who in the Book of Fenagh, page 215 states: \\"My blessing on thy men of song Who from mild Senchan may descend.‚Äù Seanchan must have been born about 560 AD to have allowed him time to complete the long course of study to be named Chief Ollam of Ireland. Furthermore, in Tromd√°mh Guaire he is referred to as \\"the aged Senchan\\" in c.645 and Geoffrey Keating's History of Ireland states that at the Synod or Convention of Drumceat in 595 AD, \\"Seanch√°n mac Cuairfheartaigh\\" was made chief ollam over the province of Connacht. An explanation for his nickname is given in the C√≥ir Anmann (The Fitness of Names)- \\"Entry 272: Sench√°n Toirp√©ist .i.

Hence he was so named.)\\" Senchan's wife was Brigit, his son was called Muircc or Murgen and his daughter was Maeve Neidigh. Some of Senchan's work is preserved in the Book of Lecan, folio 17, col. 2, a poem on the battles of Fergus, son of Rossa. He wrote a poem beginning \\"Abbair fri sil nEogain moir\\", in Laud 610, fol 73 b 2 (ZCP 12, 1918, p. 378 Kuno Meyer); another called Tr√≠ meic Ruaid; another beginning Find Taulcha tuath cuire Cailte[Find Taulcha tuath cuire Cailte] and a poem beginning \\"Co slonnad Conmaic fri Connad\\" (ZCP 14 1923 p. 48 Margaret Dobbs). Cath Maighe L√©na contains a poem by Sench√°n commencing 'Adhaigh Luain rucadh an r√≠'. In a list of ancient Irish authors contained in the Book of Ballymote, p. 308, it states \\"Sencan Toirpeist in Rigfili\\". King Guaire of Connacht According to the old tale called Tromd√°mh Guaire (The Heavy Company of Guaire) or Imtheacht na Tromdhaimhe (The Proceedings of the Great Bardic Institution) he visited the residence of the King of Connacht, Guaire Aidne mac Colm√°in accompanied by one hundred and fifty other poets, one hundred and fifty pupils \\"with a corresponding number of women-servants, dogs, etc\\". The accommodating powers of Guaire's establishment were strained during their stay of \\"a year, a quarter, and a month.\\" To shame Seanchan into leaving, Guaire asked him to recite the long-forgotten epic the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge, with the words: Bear the cup to Seanchan Torpest Yield the bard his poet's mead What we've heard was but a fore-taste Lays more lofty now succeed. Though my stores be emptied well-nigh Twin bright cups there yet remain Win them with the raid of Cualigne Chant us, bard, the famous Tain. Seanchan was deeply offended; Thus in hall of Gort spoke Guaire for the king, let truth be told bounteous though he was, was weary of giving goblets, giving gold giving aught the Bard demanded but when for the Tain he called Seanchan from his seat descended shame and anger fired the skald. Seanchan departed, with the following farewall: We depart from thee, O stainless Guaire A year, a quarter, and a month Have we sojourned with thee, high King Three times fifty poets, good and smooth Three times fifty students in the poetic art Each with a servant and a dog They were all fed in the one great house. Each man had his separate meal Each man had his separate bed We never arose at early morning Without contentions, without calming. I declare to Thee, God Who canst the promise verify That, should we return to our own lands We shall visit thee again, O Guaire, tho' now we depart. T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge The result of this incident was the gathering of all the poets of Ireland by Seanchan, to determine which one of them knew the entire of the T√°in. While some knew different parts, none knew the whole epic, it been written in a book long since taken abroad. To rectify this, Seanchan, accompanied by his son Murgen and his second cousin Eimena, undertook to travel in search of the book and return the T√°in to Ireland. This resulted in Murgen being lost in a magical mist, when he encountered the ghost of Fergus mac R√≥ich at his grave. Fergus related the whole of the Tain to Murgen, who returned and related the story to his brother and father, thus preserving the tale for future generations. Senchan and his wife also appear in the old tale Sc√©la Cano meic Gartn√°in and in Cormac's Glossary where he visits the Isle of Man. The Middle-Irish poem c. 1100 'Aimirgein Gl√∫ngel tuir tend', attributed to Gilla in Choimded √öa Cormaic of Tulach L√©is, refers to Senchan- Stanza 57. \\"Sench√°n Toirp√©ist ba rind r√°id.\\" ('Sench√°n Torp√©ist he was the apex of speech'). He also appears in the tale \\"Mac telene do feraib Muman\\". Senchan's wandering band of poets occur in traditional tales as far apart as Scotland and Nova Scotia, where they are referred to as \\"Cliar Sheanachain\\" (Senchan's lot) or \\"Cleith Sheanchair\\". A popular Highland tale featuring Senchan is \\"Great Br√≠d of the Horses\\" which is based on 'Tromd√°mh Guaire'. References by Shakespeare William Shakespeare mentions the power of Irish poets \\"rhyming rats to death\\", a remark apparently based on an incident when Seanchan, finding that rats had eaten his dinner, uttered the vindictive aer: \\"Rats have sharp snouts/Yet are poor fighters...\\" which killed ten of them on the spot.

Hopwood became well- known as a jailhouse lawyer who served time in prison for bank robbery. While in prison, he started spending time in the law library, and became an accomplished United States Supreme Court practitioner by the time he left in 2009. Early life Hopwood is the son of Robert Mark Hopwoodhttps://columbustelegram.com/news/local/obituaries/robert-mark- hopwood/article_3307083d-98c3-57ee-af09-2d992cb0f5d8.html and Becky Richards, who raised him in a Christian home. He grew up in David City, Nebraska, approximately an hour's drive northwest of Lincoln, Nebraska. Hopwood is the eldest of five siblings. Hopwood excelled on standardized tests. He was a high school basketball standout, earning himself a scholarship to Midland University in Fremont, Nebraska. After Hopwood realized he was a mediocre talent in basketball, he became disillusioned and did not go to classes. After leaving school, Hopwood joined the United States Navy. He was stationed in the Persian Gulf. While in the Navy, Hopwood guarded warships with shoulder- mounted Stinger missiles. He almost died from acute pancreatitis in a Bahrain hospital, which prompted his discharge from the Navy. Bank robbery Hopwood pled guilty on October 28, 1998, to robbing several banks in Nebraska. United States District Judge Richard G. Kopf sentenced Hopwood to 12 years, three months in prison followed by three years of supervised release and ordered $134,544 in restitution. Kopf was stunned by Hopwood's later transformation and said, \\"my gut told me that [he] was a punk‚Äîall mouth, and very little else. My viscera was wrong.\\" In Kopf's own opinion, \\"Hopwood proves that my sentencing instincts suck.\\" Jailhouse lawyer Hopwood served his prison sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Pekin. While at Pekin, he spent five weeks in solitary confinement, and criticized the practice once he got out. He prepared his first petition for certiorari for a fellow inmate on a prison typewriter in 2002. Since Hopwood was not a lawyer, the only name on the brief was that of the other prisoner, John Fellers. Once the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, he worked with Seth Waxman, a former United States Solicitor General, in preparing the case. Waxman stated that the petition for writ of certiorari was probably one of the best he had ever seen. The court received 7,209 petitions that year from prisoners and others too poor to pay the filing fee, and it agreed to hear just eight of them. One was Fellers v. United States. The court, in a 9-0 decision, found that police had acted unconstitutionally in questioning Fellers, who had been convicted of a drug conspiracy. Fellers's sentence was ultimately reduced by four years. In 2005, the Supreme Court granted a second cert petition prepared by Hopwood, vacating a lower court decision and sending the case back for a fresh look. Hopwood has also helped inmates from Indiana, Michigan and Nebraska get sentence reductions of 3 to 10 years from lower courts. He also won honorable mention in the PEN American Center 2008 Prison Writing contest. Hopwood was released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons on April 9, 2009. In 2010, he was working at Cockle Printing in Omaha, Nebraska, a leading printer of Supreme Court briefs. Law school and legal career Hopwood holds a Bachelor of Science from Bellevue University in Bellevue, Nebraska, and a Juris Doctor from the University of Washington School of Law, where he was a Gates Public Service Law Scholar. He accepted an offer to spend a year working as a law clerk for Judge Janice Rogers Brown of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after he graduated from law school. On September 4, 2014, the Supreme Court of Washington approved the recommendation made by the Character and Fitness Committee of the Washington State Bar Association, permitting Hopwood to take the Washington bar examination, and to become an attorney if he passed. His ability to become of a member of the Washington State Bar Association was named one of the 14 memorable National Law Journal Supreme Court of the United States stories of 2014. In 2015, Hopwood became a licensed lawyer in the state of Washington. In 2015, Hopwood accepted a position as a graduate teaching fellow in Georgetown University Law Center's Appellate Litigation Clinic, where he was pursuing a Master of Laws degree. In 2017, Hopwood became a professor of law at Georgetown. Writings and views Hopwood's memoir, Law Man: My Story of Robbing Banks, Winning Supreme Court Cases, and Finding Redemption, co-written with Dennis Burke, was published in August 2012. In the memoir, Hopwood details both his life as a jailhouse lawyer and his romance with his wife, Ann Marie Hopwood, who Hopwood wrote during eight years of his imprisonment. Law Man received critical acclaim from a number of book reviewers. Hopwood is a criminal justice advocate, and he has written about the need for federal sentencing and prison reform. Hopwood told an ACLU event that his home state of Nebraska should reform sentencing guidelines for prisoners, keep good time credits and not build a new prison.

It is located south of the district of Risskov, along the Bay of Aarhus. History The restaurant Sjette Frederiks Kro (1825). Riis Skov has a long history of recreational activities. This small patch of forest, was formally presented to Aarhus in 1395, by Queen Margaret I. Riis Skov was the first public forest in Denmark, where forests traditionally were owned and managed by the Royal family or the nobility and in some cases ordinary farmers. Timber and firewood were very important resources in former times, needed for shipbuilding, house construction and various other important structures, or simply for heating and cooking. Although Riis Skov was a public forest, there was still active forestry going on until around the year 1800, when the large oaks were cut and used for quay-building in the Aarhus harbour. A few of them are still left, as some of the oldest trees in the forest. The forestry aspect gradually diminished and Riis Skov was increasingly viewed as a recreational area by the citizens. On the evening of October 2, 1951, at 18:15, a meteorite exploded above Aarhus and one of two pieces was recovered in Riis Skov, just a few minutes after impact. A memorial stone commemorates the event. Recreation Riis Skov has a long cultural history as a recreational area for Aarhus and its citizens and several buildings in the forest still stands as witnesses; the public sea-bath Den Permanente from 1933, the inn of Sjette Frederiks Kro (named after King Frederik VI) from 1825,Sjette Frederiks Kro official homepage Aarhus Citizens Shooting Associations headquarters from 1881 and the old Dancing Pavillon from 1869, now a hostel.Danhostel Aarhus The forest is a protected area and the commercial forestry activities are limited nowadays. Nature The forest is largely dominated by beech, but with oak, larch, maple, ash and birch mixed in at some places. Although beech is dominant, Riis Skov is not a natural beech forest and new trees are planted occasionally to replenish the old growth. As a curiosity, the forest floor of Riis Skov is covered by ramsons in the spring. It is said, that this culinary plant was brought here by camping Spanish soldiers during the Napoleonic wars. While Spanish soldiers indeed camped in Aarhus, ramson have been growing in Denmark since the last glacial period and it might have been here in Riis Skov since the 13th century, before the Spaniards came along.

An important precursor of the Barbizon school, Michel was practically unknown during his lifetime, and worked as copyist and restorer. Michel was born in Paris. His father was an employee at Les Halles, a large marketplace in the central part of the city. Michel's first patron, at a very early age, was a certain Monsieur de Chalue. His first painting teacher was one Leduc, a history painter, and later Michel studied under Nicolas- Antoine Taunay. Although he exhibited at the Paris Salon, he failed to achieve recognition and earned his living by working as copyist and restorer; he specialized in Dutch paintings and was helped in business by √âlisabeth-Louise Vig√©e-Le Brun's husband. Most of Michel's work concentrates on rural landscapes in the area around Paris. He was influenced by Dutch landscape painters such as Jacob van Ruisdael and Meindert Hobbema. Michel worked in oil and watercolor with equal facility. He was forgotten for decades after his death; the first large exhibition of his work was presented by the Parisian Jean Charpentier hotel, in 1927. Today his works are found in museums around the world, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Portland Art Museum, Vanderbilt University Gallery, Strasbourg Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Victoria and Albert Museum, and many others.

He is best known as the designer of the Harrington Rod, the first device for the straightening and immobilization of the spine inside the body. It entered common use in the early 1960s and remained the gold standard for scoliosis surgery until the late 1990s. During this period over one million people benefited from Harrington's procedure. Early life Harrington was born September 27, 1911 and educated in the Kansas City school system, from which he graduated in 1930, having been named one of the State of Kansas' 15 most outstanding high-school graduates. He had initially not planned to go to college but changed his mind after being offered a basketball scholarship by the University of Kansas. During his time at the University of Kansas he competed on their basketball team, which won the Big Eight championship three years in a row. In his senior year he was elected captain of the team. An initial interest in the field of physical education bloomed into an interest in medicine. He attended the University of Kansas School of Medicine and graduated in 1939, having worked his way through school playing semi-professional basketball. In 1936 he tried out for the national Olympic team and won the championship of his region in the javelin, but did not end up attending the finals in Chicago due to the cost involved. Harrington undertook his internship and first year of surgical residency at Roper Hospital, Charleston, South Carolina, after which he returned to St Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, where he completed his residency in orthopaedic surgery in 1942, under Doctors Frank Dickson and Rex Dively. He then joined the United States Army. In the Army, from May 1942 to November 1945 Harrington served as a doctor at the 77th Evacuation Hospital in World War II, acting as chief of the orthopaedic service. The 77th Evacuation Hospital was made up largely of medical practitioners from the University of Kansas Schools of Medicine and Nursing, and saw service in Europe and Africa. It was during his time with the 77th that Harrington encountered such military celebrities as General George S. Patton. Following the war Harrington moved to Texas and worked as a surgeon at Jefferson Davis County Hospital in Houston. During the post-war years a poliomyelitis epidemic caused polio cases to swell dramatically and they eventually became his main priority. At this time he worked with the Baylor College of Medicine to create the Southwest Respiratory Foundation of the National Infantile Paralysis Association, the first such organisation in the United States. Polio patients would sometimes develop scoliosis, a condition where the spine becomes curved laterally (from side to side). Harrington realised that existing treatments for scoliosis, which relied heavily on physical therapy, were inappropriate for patients paralysed by polio, and began to research new treatments. An early method he tried for scoliotic polio patients was manual correction of the scoliotic deformity at the time of surgery, and internal fixation of each facet. There were some benefits to this treatment but Harrington found that the fixation would not hold. The hooks and threaded rods used would corrode and break, causing curvature to return to the spine. Two patients of this procedure died. Undeterred, from the late 1940s to late 1950s Harrington worked on what would eventually become known as the Harrington implant, or Harrington Rod. Harrington Rod Lateral curvature of the spine in a scoliosis patient The Harrington Rod, or Harrington implant, is a device for the straightening of the spine inside the body, designed by Paul Harrington. The device consists of a stainless steel rod, attached to the spine at the top and bottom of the curve with hooks. Attached ratchets are then tightened to distract or straighten the spine. Following surgery to insert the rod, the patient wears a postoperative plaster cast or brace for a few months, until vertebral fusion has occurred, after which the cast or brace is removed. Harrington's first uses of the device that would become the Harringon Rod involved creating fresh instruments on the night before a prospective surgery. Following the surgery, he would modify the design for use on the next patient, making alterations based on his perception of the surgery outcome. Once Harrington was satisfied with the basic design, he arranged for extensive testing of the instruments at the Engineering Department at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and at a commercial testing company in Chicago, Illinois. He publicly presented the process at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in Chicago in 1958, where it was met with \\"astonishment and deep skepticism\\". However, the process slowly gained acceptance. In 1959 Harrington contracted with the medical manufacturing firm Zimmer to make his instrumentation available to other doctors. He insisted that no one be allowed to use the rods without first seeing him demonstrate the procedure. Time Magazine reported in 1960, \\"Some ailments seem almost preferable to their cures. A case in point is scoliosis, an abnormal curvature of the spine that occurs in childhood. [The] treatment seems so punishing that [parents] cannot be persuaded to permit it even to save their children from permanent deformity. Last week Houston surgeon Paul Harrington, MD, was winning converts to a new and happier method.\\" The major drawback of the Harrington Rod is that it straightens out the normal front to back curvature of the segment of the spine that is fused, which in many patients results in a flat back deformity, also known as \\"flatback syndrome\\". Advances in surgical techniques and technology in the late 1990s were eventually able, in most cases, to correct scoliosis without causing flatback syndrome, leading to the gradual phasing out of the Harrington Rod. Late life During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harrington traveled extensively, demonstrating the techniques associated with the Harrington Rod. During this time he developed an interest in boats, which led to designing and building a 54-foot aluminium catamaran. He also dabbled in photography and high-fidelity systems. In 1966, Harrington was one of the founding members of the Scoliosis Research Society, of which he later served as President from 1972 to 1973. He also acted as orthopaedic consultant to the United States Air Force and United States Army in San Antonio, Texas. He acted as a Professor of the Division of Orthopaedic Surgery and a Professor of the Department of Rehabilitation at Baylor College of Medicine. In 1973 he received the Cora and Webb Mading Medal from TIRR Memorial Hermann, formerly the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research, and Baylor College of Medicine, and in the same year he also received the Nicolas Andry Award from the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons. In 1975 he received a Most Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Medical Alumni Association at the University of Kansas. Between 1972 and his death in 1980, Harrington worked with Marc Addason Asher to institute the Mary Alice and Paul R. Harrington Distinguished Professorship of Molecular Orthopedics at Kansas University Medical College. Death and legacy Harrington died in Houston, Texas, on November 29, 1980. In an obituary following his death, the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery said, \\"Paul will be remembered not only for the development of the Harrington instruments, but for his straightforward frankness, his bowties, his par golf, his smile, his trumpet, and above all for being a nice person.\\" By will, Harrington left his professional materials to the University of Kansas Medical Centre, where they are now known as the Harrington Archives. The archives contain \\"Harrington's professional papers, photographs, publications, manuscripts, blueprints, drawings, and examples of the Harrington Rod\\". They also include \\"biographical information, presentations, professional correspondence files, personal correspondence, personal photographs, movies, and videotapes. Display cases in the archives exhibit photographs, documents, and artifacts that depict the history of Harrington's life and career\\". In 1992, Harrington's writings were collected by Nancy J. Hulston and Marc A. Asher in The Collected Writings of Paul Randall Harrington, MD, published by Lowell Press.

The Council had been considering the question of Cambodia and the occupation of the country by Vietnamese troops for almost a decade, however, the Council could not act due to lack of agreement amongst its permanent members. Instead, it was addressed by the General Assembly. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Vietnam installed a puppet government, which was opposed by several groups in the country, including the United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia, Khmer People's Liberation Front and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, but supported by both Vietnam and the Soviet Union. Representatives from each party gathered for the Paris Conference in 1989, but an agreement was not reached. After the Fall of Nations, the September 1990 Sino-Vietnamese favored the Beijing-proposed 13 members dialogue6 from the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, 2 from the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, 2 from the king, 2 from Son Sann, and the king Norodom Sihanouk himself instead of the Hanoi-proposed 12 members dialogue solution6 from the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party and 6 from the Party of Democratic Kampuchea.. Following discussions in Indonesia and Japan in October 1990, the parties agreed a plan in which they would be guided by certain principles in order to solve the Cambodian problem. The Security Council, in Resolution 668, acknowledged and welcomed the agreement. The resolution went on to welcome the creation of a Supreme National Council as a source of authority throughout the transitional period. It also requested other countries and the Secretary-General to continue to assist in the peace settlement. A move in the General Assembly to endorse the peace process was also approved in Resolution 45/3 on 15 October 1990.

It is a way to enable severely disabled people to move and so alleviate complaints such as constipation and spasms. Wagon-bed riding may be considered a special kind of hippotherapy. The wagon is a steel construction pulled by two trained horses. Canvas is stretched over the backs of the horses. The patient is placed in supine position on the canvas in the slight hollow between the horses. The rhythm, the warmth of the horses and the ambience has a relaxing and massaging effect on the patient. Wagon-bed riding is suitable for people who do not get enough physical exercise because of a handicap. During wagon-bed riding the blood circulation and vital functions, such as metabolism and digestion are stimulated. It has a beneficial effect on people who find it difficult to walk. Complaints such as constipation, epileptic seizures and lung obstruction (e.g. cystic fibrosis), may be reduced by wagon-bed riding. It has also been shown that wagon-bed riding has a stimulating effect on coma patients. Wagon- bed riding was started in Bennekom (Netherlands), where the \\"Riding school without thresholds‚Äù was established in 1985 upon the initiatives of the Wageningen milkman Johan Roelofsen (1933‚Äì2011).History of wagon-bed riding (in Dutch) As of 2015 there are around twenty locations providing wagon-bed riding, and training for carers is given at the CDB (cursuscentrum Dieropleidingen Barneveld) in nearby Barneveld.Training centers As of 2012 there is a new location in Italy. Close to Rome, in Palidoro.  The horses  The horses used are usually Tinkers, Fjords and Haflingers. A shoulder height between 1.40 and 1.45m is ideal. The horses should be of equal shoulder height, preferably have a long back and an even, calm tread. Training a team of horses usually takes a year. Smaller ponies are used for small wagons, but these are not suitable for bigger children or adults and the ponies do not have such a calm tread.  The canvas fabric beds  There are generally 3 types of wagons: * The three-wheeled ‚Äústandard‚Äù type with one swivel wheel at the front and an axle at the rear, above which the driver‚Äôs frame is located. * The four-wheeled type with two swivel wheels at the front and an axle at the rear, above which the driver‚Äôs frame is located * The three-wheeled balance type with two wheels beside the middle of the horses and one swivel wheel at the rear, behind the driver‚Äôs frame. Four-wheeled wagon-bed The four-wheeled wagon and three-wheeled balance wagon can be provided with a lifting platform to lift the patient onto the canvas fabric bed. With the three-wheeled ‚Äústandard‚Äù type, the patient is lifted onto the canvas with a separate lifting aid. Some wagons are provided with a cushion against which the horses can push, so that they don‚Äôt require a chest harness and ropes and can be taken in and out of harness quicker. The frame to which the canvas is fixed should be adjustable for height appropriate to the horses. In order to intensify the transfer of the motion of the horses to the participant, the canvas on which the participants lies is provided with straps around it or at both sides.  The riding school  The space within the riding school should be as generous as possible (at least 40x20m) and have a firm smooth surface. Depending on the patient, additional (medical) provisions may be necessary. Wagon riding is also combined with care farms and general care institutions.

He served as president and secretary of the Southwestern Indiana Historical Society for a number of years. He was well known for his writings concerning the area of Indiana known as \\"the Pocket\\" and was considered an authority on the history of southern Indiana. Background De la Hunt was born in Cannelton, Perry County, Indiana to Major Thomas James De la Hunt, Sr. (1835‚Äì1872) and his wife, Isabelle (Huckeby) De la Hunt (1845‚Äì1909). He had one other sibling, Charles Mason De la Hunt, who died in 1869. His father was an immigrant from County Tipperary, Ireland. His mother was the daughter of J. B. Huckeby, an Indiana legislator and prominent Cannelton lawyer. He never married. Career De la Hunt received his early education from his mother and in the Cannelton public schools. Afterwards, he attended Sewanee University (now University of the South) at Sewanee, Tennessee, and studied architecture at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Upon leaving college, he taught for seven years in the Cannelton public schools and gave private music lessons to students. He was involved in the insurance business for several years. During his later years, he devoted his time entirely to writing and historical research. In 1916 De la Hunt wrote a script and produced the pageant given at Cannelton to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of Indiana's admission to the Union. In connection with the same celebration, he also wrote a history of Perry County, Indiana, recognized by authorities as unexcelled in that particular field. De la Hunt achieved further distinction in southern Indiana with his column, \\"The Pocket Periscope\\", featured over a number of years in the Evansville Courier and Journal. In this column he presented a series of historical sketches of particular interest to the \\"Pocket Section\\" of Indiana. He was also correspondent of the Indianapolis News, the Louisville Courier Journal, and the Owensboro, Kentucky Messenger. He edited the Cannelton column in the Tell City News over a period of about eight years. At various times he did special research and catalogue work for a number of libraries in southern Indiana. Many of his writings were published in the Indiana History Bulletin and the Indiana Magazine of History. Later life Until incapacitated by ill health, De la Hunt was active in patriotic and historical organizations and took great pride in his membership in the same. In the Sons of the American Revolution he served as vice president and treasurer for Indiana over a period of years. In the Society of Indiana Pioneers he served on various committees. He was president and secretary of the Southwestern Indiana Historical Society for several years. In 1931 and 1932 he was president of the Perry County Historical Society. He also served as president of the Indiana Authors Club and was a charter member of the Men's Community Bible Class of Cannelton. De la Hunt died at his home, the Virginia Place, in Cannelton on July 3, 1933, at the age 66. His house is still standing and is rumoured by local citizens to be haunted.

McNab was born on 11 May 1820 at Achrinich, parish of Morven, Argyllshire, Scotland, son of Patric McNab and his wife Cirsty. He entered Blair College, a seminary near Aberdeen, in 1832 and in June 1835 to the Scots College in Rome but left before taking his oath as a missionary on 8 August 1840. He was ordained a priest in Scotland on 8 March 1845. He later stated that he had dreamed of becoming a missionary to the Australian Aborigines at that time, perhaps inspired by what he had heard from the family of his fathers sister's family the MacKillop family in the colony of Victoria, but was refused by a bishop perpetually short of priests, and spent twenty years in parish work before finally migrating to Australia on board the Chariot of Fame in July 1867. Here he was again refused permission to embark on a mission to Aboriginals until 1875 where he began work in the colony of Queensland. McNab firmly believed in restoring Aboriginal People to equal rights and considering their attachment to their land he believed that the best way of assisting them was to help them to become settlers on sections of their own tribal land and on equal terms to that of white settlers. However, his ideas was met with powerful opposition from settlers as well as from sections of the Catholic leadership, subsequently forced McNab to leave Queensland in 1882. He then began a mission amongst Aboriginal prisoners in Western Australia, later setting up a small mission station in Goodneough Bay in the remote north of the Kimberley region. Age and illness caused him to retire to Victoria where he died in 1896. Duncan McNab, was a first cousin once removed to Sister Mary MacKillop.

The strongest earthquake to originate in the state, it measured 5.1 on a seismic scale that is based on an isoseismal map or the event's felt area. The earthquake's epicenter was near the town of Manhattan. The earthquake had a maximum perceived intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused minor damage, reports of which were confined to Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri, according to the United States Geological Survey. Felt over an area of , the earthquake reached the states of Indiana, Illinois, and possibly Ohio, though the latter reports have been questioned. Manhattan is near the Nemaha Ridge, a long anticline structure that is bounded by several faults. The nearby in particular poses a threat to the city. Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, but an earthquake could occur at any time. A 2016 hazard map from the United States Geological Survey estimated a 1% or lower risk for a major earthquake in Kansas for the following year, though scientists from the agency think an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 remains possible.  Background and geography  The alt=A map displays the Humboldt Fault, located south of the Midcontinent Rift System. The two briefly intersect. The earthquake's epicenter was near Manhattan, Kansas, a town just off the confluence of the Kansas River and the . Manhattan lies near the Nemaha Ridge, an anticline and 300‚Äëmillion-year-old Precambrian granite range bounded by faults, which likely produced the earthquake. It hosts the , which, in addition to serving as the range's easternmost boundary, has produced a large portion of the state's earthquakes. A normal, or dip-slip fault, it is responsible for at least several small tremors smaller than magnitude 2.7 each year. The fault cuts through Permian rock. Despite being previously thought to be a simple, Precambrian structure, according to the Geological Society of America, it may be a complex fault. The Nemaha Range lies roughly east of the Midcontinent rift, which forms a layer of basaltic rock about 1.1 billion years old. This rift extends northward to Lake Superior and the surrounding area and southward to Kansas, then terminates abruptly. Also present in the state is the Central Kansas Uplift, the faults of which produced several small earthquakes during the late 1980s. According to United States Geological Survey geophysicist Don Steeples, earthquakes at the Humboldt Zone have decreased, and activity at the Uplift was increasing as of the 1980s. Felt over an area of , with other sources listing the felt area as or , the 1867 earthquake followed the Midcontinent seismic trend: unlike coastal earthquakes in the United States, events in the central and east-central sectors of the country are spread out over extensive areas. This occurs as a result of the region's stiff soil, and because earthquakes in Kansas tend to occur at a shallow depth. The 1867 Manhattan earthquake remains the largest earthquake to originate in the state, though at least 25 have taken place since, including another powerful earthquake north of Manhattan in Pottawatomie County. In 2016, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake with an epicenter in Oklahoma shook the Manhattan area. According to a report in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, the frequency of moderately strong earthquakes within the state is between 40 and 45 years. One study found that between December 1977 and June 1989, more than 100 earthquakes were recognized by a seismograph network. All were between 4.0 and 0.8 on the Richter magnitude scale.  Damage and casualties  Originating at 20:22 UTC, or around 2:30 local time, the earthquake was assigned a maximum Mercalli intensity scale of VII, considered \\"very strong\\". Minor damage occurred throughout the geographical region, including 22 counties in Kansas, and injuries were reported as well. The earthquake fractured walls, downed chimneys, and otherwise damaged structures, even loosening stones. Within the epicentral area near Manhattan, clocks stopped, people felt electrical shocks and inhabitants were frightened. The following day, an aftershock occurred between 3 and 4 a.m. Damage within Manhattan and a number of other communities may have been exacerbated by their location within alluvial valleys. At a farm south of the city of Wamego, the earthquake caused liquefaction of the ground. To the north of Wamego, in the city of Louisville, the earthquake knocked over horses. In both Louisville and the city of Leavenworth, chimneys fell; in Paola, the earthquake destroyed one wall of a large Republican newspaper office building. Waves were observed on the Kansas River, reaching in height. The city of Atchison felt two shocks, which felled lamps and bottles at a drug store, rocked buildings, and disrupted water flow in rivers and creeks. Though no buildings in the city sustained damage, people fled into the streets. Lecompton, a building at Lane University (pictured) shook from the earthquake.|alt=A stone building can be seen from the street, with a flagpole next to it; this was one of the buildings at Lane University in Lecompton, Kansas. In Emporia, the earthquake was accompanied by a low rumbling sound, windows rattled, and small boxes were thrown off of shelves as people fled buildings. The city's brick and stone houses sustained more damage than framed homes. The city of Fort Scott only experienced trembling, whereas Iola had houses and tableware shake. In Holton, items were knocked off shelves, and buildings shook. Residents of Irving also heard rumbling prior to the earthquake, experiencing severe tremors that lasted 30 seconds, while buildings in Junction City shook violently, moving several inches. In Kansas City, tables moved, walls cracked, water spilled from glasses, plaster cracked, and the shaking caused general panic. The city of Lawrence felt three earthquakes within 30 seconds, with violent shaking of doors and windows, broken plaster, a rumbling noise, stones knocked off a local church, rattling of silverware and glassware, and the overturning of a stove in one home. Similarly, in the city of Leavenworth, three shocks were felt over 30 seconds. In Leavenworth, a man was knocked off a hayload, a rumbling noise was heard, and clocks stopped. Moreover, saws leaning against walls were moved , plaster at one home cracked for the entire length of the house's ceiling, and one woman experienced an electrical shock from spring water. In the city of Lecompton, one of the buildings at Lane University shook, and a high school in the city of Marysville also shook violently. Within Montgomery County, people in moving vehicles did not feel the earthquake. Houses shook in Mound City, Ottawa, and Olathe, as well as in the city of Oskaloosa, where the cupola (a relatively small, most often dome-like, tall structure) of a new school wobbled. In Paola, people standing were nearly knocked over during the earthquake. A train on the Pacific Railroad in Solomon shook violently, and was stopped and evacuated out of fear that its boiler would explode. In Topeka, the capital city of Kansas, the ceiling of a Methodist church was bent, and nearly all of the windows in one schoolhouse were destroyed. Two shocks were felt in the city of White Cloud, and sleeping people were awakened in . Reports from the states of Iowa and Missouri, including descriptions of fallen plaster in Dubuque, shaking of buildings and people in rocking chairs in Des Moines, and fallen and cracked plaster in Chillicothe, complement additional reports of fallen plaster and roof shingles, damaged wells, and cracked walls. Other events reported in Dubuque included three shocks, which caused vibration of gas burners; general panic among residents; rattling of windows; shaking of chairs, cases holding newspapers, and windows; and holes in brick walls. In the city of St. Joseph in Missouri, the windows broke, women fainted, and a rumbling noise could be heard. Within the city, a new school building's brick walls cracked several feet above the ground as people fled into the streets. In Warrensburg, Missouri, the walls of a church shook, but there was no damage. The earthquake also extended into the states of Indiana and Illinois, according to the , and a questionable report came from Carthage in Ohio that a segment of the ground, in area, sunk by , forming a perpendicular wall deep on each of its sides. A series of articles published by the Chicago Tribune describes the extent of the damage throughout the state of Kansas. The article \\"At Kansas City\\" details that the earthquake jolted homes with a sudden burst, giving off a resonating roar like thunder. The Tribune observed in its article \\"At Leavenworth, Kansas\\" that the earthquake was completely unexpected, describing the event as \\"[...] sudden in its coming and departure.\\" It confirmed that earthquakes were not common in earlier times and stated that \\"all were more or less startled, and, indeed, frightened.\\"  Future threats  alt=From the west, a large dam and the body of water it holds sit to the left of a grassy area with some trees Although Kansas is not seismically active, a strong earthquake could pose significant threats to the state. If an earthquake were to occur, it would likely be along the Nemaha Ridge, which is still active. The Humboldt Fault Zone, just off the Ridge, lies just east of the near Manhattan. An earthquake there would likely destroy the dam, releasing of water per second and flooding the nearby area, which would threaten roughly 13,000 people and 5,900 homes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded that a moderate earthquake \\"between 5.7 and 6.6 would cause sand underneath the dam to liquefy into quicksand, causing the dam to spread out and the top to drop up to three feet.\\" A large earthquake would spawn gaps, forcing water to leak and eventually cause the dam to collapse. Earthquakes that could pose a threat to the dam occur on a cycle of roughly 1,800 years. To counter this threat, the Corps of Engineers has galvanized an effort to strengthen the dam. Replacing the sand (which could shift during an earthquake) with more than 350 walls, the group has equipped the dam with sensors, which are connected to alarms that would alert nearby citizens to the earthquake. More than 500 earthquakes have been measured in the state since 2013, contributing to the reactivation of ancient fault lines. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey made hazard maps for the state, determining a 1% or lower risk of a major earthquake within the next year. Because Sedgwick and Wichita counties could both potentially experience shaking from earthquakes that could not be withstood according to existing building codes, officials in the area proposed changing building codes to meet perceived hazards. Scientists at the United States Geological Survey think an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 remains possible, possibly originating from the Nemaha Ridge where the Manhattan quake was produced.

Life and career Garvin was born in Harlem and raised by foster parents in the Bronx. He took piano lessons as a child. In 1954, he helped form The Hearts, a female vocal group with whom he sang bass, played piano and wrote and arranged songs. Managed by neighbor Zelma \\"Zell\\" Sanders, The Hearts' first record \\"Lonely Nights\\" was issued on the Baton label in early 1955 and reached No. 8 on the Billboard R&B; chart. He remained involved with the group as their pianist, arranger, musical director and (in their own word) \\"maestro\\" through various personnel changes during the 1950s, later explaining that he did so \\"mainly to meet girls\\".Rex Garvin at Black Cat Rockabilly Members of The Hearts later performed as The Jaynetts. At the same time, Garvin became Sanders' main assistant at J&S; Records, which she set up in 1956, and he was responsible for the label's typical full, bottom-heavy piano-laden arrangements. The label's greatest successes came with the duo Johnnie and Joe, whose biggest hit \\"Over the Mountain, Across the Sea\\" (#8 Pop and No. 3 R&B; in 1957) was written by Garvin, who sang harmony vocals on the song and was credited as bandleader.The Hearts by J. C. Marion The duo comprised Garvin's friend Joe Rivers, and Sanders' daughter Johnnie. The song was covered in 1963 by Bobby Vinton, whose version reached No. 21 on the Hot 100. Garvin's own recording career started in 1957, with \\"My Darling Dear\\".Rex Garvin discography at SoulfulKindaMusic.com In 1959, his vocal duet with Marie Knight as Marie and Rex on \\"I Can't Sit Down\\" reached No. 94 on the Billboard pop chart. He formed his own group Rex Garvin and the Mighty Cravers in 1961, releasing their first single \\"Go Little Willie\\"/\\"Emulsified\\", on Epic Records; the single was reissued two years later by Okeh. The group toured widely on the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\". Although Garvin had little commercial success, he released a string of records through the 1960s in a variety of styles, including \\"Oh Yeah!\\" (on the Scatt label, an offshoot of J&S;, 1962), \\"Soul Food\\" (on Keynote, 1963), \\"Sock It To 'Em J.B.\\" (originally on the Like label, 1966), \\"I Gotta Go Now (Up on the Floor)\\" (Like, 1967), and \\"You Don't Need No Help (You Can Sock It to Yourself)\\" (WSJ Sound, 1969). Rex Garvin discography at wangdangdula.com Several of these recordings have been anthologized in recent years, particularly on Northern Soul compilations. \\"Sock It to 'Em J.B.\\" had a double meaning, being a tribute to James Bond performed in the style of James Brown; it was issued as a single in the UK as well as the U.S., and later was covered by British band The Specials on their album More Specials in 1980 (a cover which lent the song a potential triple meaning, as it was also a form of homage to drummer John Bradbury).

It was founded in 2007 by Danielle Butin, MPH, OTR after a trip to Tanzania, where she encountered the dire circumstances and severely limited medical resources of their medical clinics. Afya, which means \\"good health\\" in Swahili seeks to spread \\"Good Health Through Giving,\\" and does so by providing medical supplies, consumables, sustainable equipment, and community outreach supplies to international health clinics.  Mission  The primary goal of Afya is to bring good health to those who need it most. One way in which it accomplishes this goal is by collecting donations of surplus medical supplies from New York hospitals. These supplies are stored temporarily in the Yonkers warehouse until volunteers load them into 40 foot containers bound for various international locations. Afya tailors its shipments to the needs of specific communities by maintaining an up-to-date computer-based inventory menu from which international health organizations and professionals can self-select medical supplies from the warehouse via the web.  Programs  Shipments of Supplies: Afya has sent over 30 supply filled 40 foot containers to Haiti, Ghana, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Malawi, and Sierra Leone. Included in these shipments are a range of items from ultrasound machines and operating tables to soccer balls and pens. A wide range of vital supplies are required for clinicians to provide adequate care to the members of the communities they serve. In addition to shipping 40 foot containers, duffel bags can also be requested and shipped with medical personnel who are making a specific international aid trips. Supplies that are generally accepted include: Tents, Sleeping bags, Umbrellas, Rain boots, Bug Spray, Crutches, Wheelchairs, Gloves, Water Purification Tablets, Ensure/Liquid Food, Personal Care Items, Gauze, Bandages, Sheets, and Blankets. Gloria's Gathering: provides a venue for mourning friends and family to honor a loved one by donating rehabilitated medical supplies that were used during recuperation and end of life that would otherwise wind up in a landfill. After rehabilitation, these supplies are distributed in developing nations throughout Africa and the Caribbean. The project is named in honor of Gloria Bobrow, wife of Edwin Bobrow: Afya advisor board member, author, management consultant, and retired Adjunct Associate Professor at NYU. Afya Clubs: Over 15 clubs across the country have already been founded by middle school, high school, and college students to spread the word about Afya and collect supplies in their own communities. Any and all youth are encouraged to get involved and start their own clubs in order to help Afya to continue in providing vital supplies to international health clinics and communities in need. Alex, a teenager from the New York area ran a collection drive for soccer equipment. He started by getting in touch with local youth soccer commissioner, to set up donation boxes at local youth soccer games. By the end of his project, he had managed to collect enough soccer equipment to furnish an entire youth soccer league in Neno, Malawi. The Women's Track and Field team at Haverford College recently completed a collection campaign. Over 100 pairs of shoes were donated and shipped to the Afya warehouse, where they will be distributed to those in need.  Response to 2010 Haiti earthquake  On January 12, 2010 an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 Mw shook Haiti. It has been estimated that the lives of 3 million people have been effected by the event. Within two days, Afya shipped a 40-foot container holding mattresses, respirators, backboards, and surgical packs to aid the ailing nation. Through their collaboration with Partners in Health, Afya shipped 2500 pounds of supplies via airplane, along with four additional 40-foot containers within two weeks of the initial event. On January 28, 2010 Afya shipped its sixth container to Haiti, increasing the amount of supplies sent by Afya to over 400,000 pounds of vital supplies targeted to relief workers to aid them in their amazing efforts. As long as there is a need for these supplies, the Afya Foundation plans to provide as much aid as they are able.

She was one of the first ten women to graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with her degrees in architecture. Luscomb became a partner in an early woman- owned architecture firm before work in the field became scarce during World War I. She then dedicated herself fully to activism in the women's suffrage movement, becoming a prominent leader of Massachusetts suffragists. Early life Luscomb was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Otis and Hannah Skinner (Knox) Luscomb. Her father was an unsuccessful artist. Her mother was a dedicated suffragist and women's rights activist. When Florence was one and a half years old, her parents separated and she moved with her mother to Boston, while her older brother Otis Kerro Luscomb lived with their father. As a child in Boston, she went with her mother to women's suffrage events, at one point seeing Susan B. Anthony speak. She became an ardent suffragist, starting by selling a pro-suffrage newspaper on the street. Education Luscomb was among the first ten women to earn a degree in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Women still experienced significant challenges during her tenure there. For example, Luscomb had to inquire at twelve firms before one of them would hire her for an internship after her second year. Following her graduation, she was hired by Ida Annah Ryan, the sixth woman to earn an architecture degree from M.I.T. She would later become a partner in Ryan's firm. Ryan and Luscomb shared an interest in women's suffrage, and Ryan gave Luscomb a degree of flexibility at work that allowed her to be active in the women's suffrage movement. During this time, Luscomb helped organized various events for the suffrage movement, and during a debate on adding a suffrage amendment to the state constitution gave more than 200 speeches in 14 weeks. She later continued her education in architecture at the newly opened Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture in 1916, and began working with local architect Henry Atherton Frost and landscape architect Bremer Whidden Pond in addition to her work with Ryan. Her career was put on hiatus when new construction slumped due to the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917. New career begun during WWI She accepted a position as executive secretary for the Boston Equal Suffrage Association for Good Government. She went on to work for a number of organizations in the Boston area, including the Boston chapters of the League of Women Voters and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and organizations dedicated to prison reform and factory safety. She was a charter member of the League of Women Voters, formed once women gained the vote. Luscomb also helped found a local of the United Office and Professional Workers of America and served as a volunteer with the local NAACP and ACLU. From 1911 she considered herself a citizen of the world, traveling to nations across Europe and Asia for conferences, yet retained pride in her Yankee heritage. Her political views were well-developed and unique. Upon her mother's death in 1933, Luscomb inherited enough money that she could dedicate her time fully to activism. She ran for public office four times, more to make her causes visible than to win. The first, for Boston Council in 1922, she nearly won. Races for Congress in 1936 and 1950 and for governor in 1952 were largely protest campaigns. An ardent anti-McCarthyist, she was at one point called to testify before a committee in the Massachusetts legislature that was investigating communism. She wrote an early anti-Vietnam War leaflet and would later advise some of the founders of the American feminist movement, encouraging them to include the poor and women of color. Luscombe designed her own holiday cabin in Tamworth, New Hampshire and spent her summers there after WWII and until the 1970s contributing to the Appalachian Mountain Club. Florence Luscomb holding her cat Needles, ca. 1893 After her mother died, Luscomb lived in various cooperative houses, including a Cambridge cooperative house at 64 Wendell Street, where she lived until she moved in 1980 to an elder-care facility in Watertown, Massachusetts, where she died October 13, 1985, at age 98. Commemorations In 1999 a series of six tall marble panels with a bronze bust in each was added to the Massachusetts State House; the busts are of Luscomb, Dorothea Dix, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, Sarah Parker Remond, and Lucy Stone. As well, two quotations from each of those women (including Luscomb) are etched on their own marble panel, and the wall behind all the panels has wallpaper made of six government documents repeated over and over, with each document being related to a cause of one or more of the women. She is commemorated on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

He often published under the name A. A. Pearson.  Background and career  Pearson was born in London, but educated in Belgium. After leaving school he worked as a seaman before joining the firm of British Belting & Asbestos Ltd in Yorkshire, where he spent the rest of his working career, eventually becoming chairman of the firm. He had an interest in music, especially madrigals, folk song, and folk dancing, joining the English Folk Dance Society in 1924 and helping with the publication of the Folksong Index. Researches in mycology Around 1910 Pearson began to research the larger fungi, encouraged by John Ramsbottom, mycologist at the Natural History Museum. His initial papers, co-authored by E. M. Wakefield, were on British corticioid fungi and heterobasidiomycetes, but he subsequently developed an expertise in the taxonomy of agarics, publishing a series of papers on this group of fungi from 1919 to 1952. In 1948 he produced a checklist of British species, co-authored with Dr R. W. G. Dennis of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Pearson spoke several European languages, collected fungi in Spain and Portugal (on which he wrote brief papers), was an active member of the Soci√©t√© mycologique de France, and was credited with introducing new, continental ideas on modern agaric taxonomy into Britain. In 1948 he was invited to survey fungi in South Africa, publishing a number of new species as a result. His last works were a series of keys to British agaric genera, several of which were published posthumously by his friend and fellow mycologist P. D. Orton. Pearson was elected president of the British Mycological Society in 1931 and again in 1952. He was also president of the Yorkshire Naturalists Union in 1946 and a fellow of the Linnean Society.P. D. Orton (1954). Arthur Anselm Pearson. Transactions of the British Mycological Society 37: 321‚Äì323 He described several new species of fungi and at least eight species of fungi are named after him, including Cortinarius pearsonii, Paullicorticium pearsonii, and Squamanita pearsonii.http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp  Selected publications  *Pearson, A.

Primarily a figurative artist, Colson experimented with several different artistic styles, including Cubism, Surrealism, and Neoclassicism. His artistic friends included Jos√© Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. After a short but intense stay in Cuba, Colson developed a close friendship with Cuban painter Mario Carre√±o Morales.

Among them dwells a brooding, sinister man known only as \\"El Hombre,\\" whose memory was destroyed by the brutality of the Nazis. One evening, as El Hombre sits trance-like at the piano and plays a somber melody, his music drifts into the room inhabited by other refugees, Dr. Hoffman, his wife Anna, and their invalid charge, Marya Volny. El Hombre's playing reminds Anna of Jan Volny, a famous pianist from her homeland of Czechoslovakia, and she bitterly reflects upon the life that they lost. After finishing the piece, El Hombre reads a notice from the governor, warning refugees about \\"murder boats\\" that will promise them asylum in the U.S., but will leave them to perish at sea after fleecing them of their savings. The demented El Hombre takes the warning as a sign to destroy the fishing boat owned by his compassionate employer Angelo. El Hombre's act infuriates Angelo's cruel brothers, Luigi and Marco, who loathe the stranger and wish him dead. As Marya's condition worsens, Anna blames herself for forcing the girl to leave her homeland and recalls the conditions that drove them into exile: After invading Prague, the Nazis grant permission to Czech pianist Jan Volny to present a concert. They stipulate, however, that \\"The Moldau,\\" a much-loved patriotic symphony written by Bedrich Smetana, be excluded from the concert. Carried away by the beauty of the music, Volny ends his concert with a four- minute paraphrase of the famed symphony. Realizing that his act will draw the wrath of the Nazis and that his wife, Marya, will also suffer at the hands of their oppressors, Volny arranges for the Hoffmans to smuggle her out of the country, but before he can escape himself, he is captured and subjected to unspeakable violence, which deranges him. En route to a concentration camp, Volny overpowers his guards and escapes. After making his way to Lisbon, he hides on a fishing boat owned by Angelo and his brothers, which embarks shortly thereafter and carries him to the island of Guadalupe. In the fog of his unhinged brain, Volny fails to remember his own name and identity, and is thus dubbed El Hombre. As Anna's thoughts return to the present, Marya, enchanted by the sound of El Hombre's piano, rises from her bed, inches her way down the stairs and then collapses in the street. El Hombre finds her there, and as he fingers the crucifix encircling her neck, his memory begins to return. When the Hoffmans come looking for Marya, El Hombre retreats into the shadows. He begins to recall snatches of his life with Marya, but his reverie is cruelly interrupted by Luigi's harsh voice challenging him. Angelo hears shots and finds Luigi, gun in hand, standing over El Hombre's body. As the brothers argue, Luigi stabs Angelo with an ice pick. Noticing that El Hombre has vanished, the wounded Angelo follows a trail of blood up the stairs to Marya's room, where the Hoffmans are notifying the police of Marya's death. At her bedside, El Hombre cradles Marya's lifeless body in his arms, begging her to return to life. His entreaties echo the words spoken to him by Marya at the time of their separation in Czechoslovakia, affirming her certainty that he will one day come for her.

He was the nephew of painter Enrique Garc√≠a-Godoy, his first art teacher. Along with Yoryi Morel and Jaime Colson, he is considered one of the founders of the modernist school of Dominican painting. Family Born to Jaime Vicente Suro S√°nchez (born in 1890, in Utuado, Puerto Rico) and Isabel Emilia Garc√≠a-Godoy Ceara (born in 1883 to Federico Garc√≠a Godoy and Rosa Ceara Gim√©nez). He had a brother, Rub√©n Antonio (1916-2006). Early career Early on, he became popular as an Impressionist landscape artist, often painting horses and rainy scenes of the Cibao region of his country. Suro had his first solo exhibition in 1938 at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. Subsequently, the same exhibition was shown at the San Cristobal Ateneo and in 1939, he was included in group exhibitions in New York City, at the Riverside Museum and the Dominican Republic Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1940, Suro participated in the Inter-American Exhibition of the Caribbean organized by the Organization of American States. In that same year, he participated in a group show at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. In 1942, he had a solo exhibition at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santo Domingo. Mexico Museo de Arte Moderno, Santo Domingo) In 1943, he married Maruxa Franco Fernandez from Santiago and shortly after, they departed to Mexico where he was appointed cultural attach√© In the Dominican Republic Embassy. On the way, they stayed in Havana for several weeks, where his bride's cousin, Tomas Hernandez Franco, was the Dominican Consul General. There he met with the young art critic Jos√© G√≥mez-Sicre, whom he had encountered previously in Santo Domingo. Later they would renew their friendship in Washington, D.C., where G√≥mez-Sicre was the founder and director of the Art Museum of the Americas, which was established in 1976 by the O.A.S. Permanent Council. While in Havana, Suro also met and befriended important modern artists such as Fidelio Ponce, Carlos Enr√≠quez and Amelia Pel√°ez. Art study Finally arriving in Mexico after their fascinating Cuban \\"sejour\\", Suro had a very busy schedule. In addition to his duties as attach√©, he enrolled at Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\", where he studied art for nearly four years with some of the most prestigious artists in contemporary Mexico, including Diego Rivera, Agust√≠n Lazo, Jes√∫s Guerrero Galv√°n and Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano. Suro soon befriended some of the most prominent people in Mexico City, which was a great cultural center at the time, including the philosopher Alfonso Reyes, the art historian and critic Justino Fern√°ndez, painters Mar√≠a Izquierdo and Angelina Beloff (the first wife of Rivera), and writer and critic Agust√≠n Vel√°zquez Ch√°vez. He also met Jos√© Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo, Lupe Marin and Jos√© Vasconcelos, who would play a crucial role in Suro's career. In 1944, he received word that he had won the Second Prize (Silver Medal) at the Second National Fine Arts Biennial in Santo Domingo. Two years later he won First Prize (Gold Medal) at the Third National Fine Arts Biennial. Impact on work Suro's time in Mexico had a dramatic impact on his work. Moving away from a harmonious palette and depictions of pleasant, often melancholy, genre scenes that made him popular with his countrymen, he opted for something more bold and jarring. Influenced by the Mexican nationalistic spirit that embraced all things ethnic, Suro created a related Dominican vision heretofore unseen, a new kind of painting called \\"Negroide\\", which had its counterpart in Dominican literature of the time, namely in the poetry of his brother Rub√©n Suro (\\"Poemas De Una Sola Intencion\\"). Directly addressing multiracial issues (an obvious component of Dominican reality) through graphic images, was indeed a new approach in a nation where whitewashing was often the norm. Many Dominicans liked to think that their heritage derived exclusively from Spain, forgetting their important African legacy. Suro's take was confrontational and challenging, using imagery that made some of his countrymen uncomfortable. In 1946, he was included in a group show at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at the institution, an event that was widely publicized in the city, bringing him recognition from some of the most important art critics but perhaps leading to his downfall with his own government. His embassy job was suddenly terminated. Before he knew it, he was on a plane with his family going back home where he would be facing an uncertain future. Suro was told by unofficial sources that Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo was not happy with the attention his cultural attach√© had received in Mexico. Dominican Republic Upon his return to Santo Domingo, Suro and his wife were warmly greeted by family and friends, while others, especially some who were close to Trujillo, kept a certain distance. The fall from grace was short lived. Vasconcelos, his friend from Mexico, who happened to arrive in Santo Domingo on an official visit and raved to Trujillo about the recently repatriated diplomat and painter, calling him \\"brilliant\\", and strongly urging the Dominican leader to name Suro Director of Fine Arts of the nation. This happened in early 1947 and once again Suro was celebrated. That same year, he had a successful solo exhibition at the National Palace of Fine Arts in Santo Domingo, showing works that were shown in Mexico with a few recent Dominican additions. Overall, Dominicans were greatly impressed by a new dynamic vision of their nation forged in Mexico by a young Dominican. Director of Fine Arts As Director of Fine Arts, Suro was once again in the spotlight, receiving distinguished guests, including Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin and groups like the celebrated \\"Coros y Danzas\\" from Spain. He was responsible for overseeing new exhibitions at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and setting up cultural programs. He also gave lectures covering a wide range of themes, like the one on his friend Jos√© Clemente Orozco, \\"La Muerte de Orozco\\", which he gave at the Instituto Dominico Americano in Santo Domingo. In 1948, he participated in the 4th National Biennial of Fine Arts. Personal issues During this same period, the Suro family underwent dramatic, painful changes. His son, Jaime, died suddenly shortly before his second birthday. This event became an obsessive recurring leitmotif in several of his paintings. Depicting the dead child becomes a kind of catharsis in those canvases; the native Baquin√≠ ritual of burying children becomes an important point of identity for the artist. In 1948, his son Federico was born and the following year his daughter Rosa. Spain In 1950, Suro's life changed once again when he was sent to Spain as cultural attach√© of the Dominican Republic. Arriving with his family in Madrid, Suro befriended some of the most outstanding Spanish artists of that time, including Antonio Saura, Antoni T√†pies, Manolo Millares, and Jose Caballero (\\"Pepe\\"). Caballero was a close friend of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Luis Bu√±uel and others. Suro was also able to see the great art of Spain, including works by his personal favorites Vel√°zquez, El Greco and Goya. Living in Spain also facilitated extensive travel to other European cities, including Paris, London and Amsterdam. He especially loved Italy, and was particularly impressed by the works of Piero della Francesca. Combining diplomacy and art as he had in Mexico, Suro participated in group exhibitions in Madrid and Barcelona, as well as faraway places like San Francisco (Legion of Honor) and Pittsburgh (Carnegie Institute). He was invited to participate in the Sal√≥n de los Once in 1951, along with ten other artists, a venue organized by the philosopher Eugeni d'Ors. The same year, he participated in the First Hispano-American Biennial, which was exhibited in Madrid and Barcelona. He represented the Dominican Republic in several important congresses (including the Congreso de la Cooperacion Intellectual Latino Americano‚Äî1952) while continuing his travels throughout the Iberian Peninsula and several other European nations. In terms of his artistic development, Spain had a significant impact. This is where Suro painted his first abstract canvases, influenced by European trends. Dominican Republic As in Mexico, his busy professional life came to an abrupt end. His job was suddenly terminated, without any explanation. Upon arrival in Santo Domingo the same scenario was repeated that they experienced upon their return from Mexico. The Suros heard gossip about the termination of his job and a close friend, who happened to be related to Trujillo's wife, recommended that they leave the country. Leaving the country in that era was not simple. Both Dario and Maruxa were interrogated, but in a fairly short time they were on their way to New York City in 1953. Their children joined them the following year. New York City Suro's New York City experience would be decidedly different from his Mexico City and Madrid years. With limited English, the couple had a difficult time adjusting to the metropolis. His wife immediately found work as a seamstress in a factory. Suro, however had a harder time. Visiting several establishments that hired artists to do fairly routine work, he soon realized that there was little demand. He finally found a job on 23rd Street, in a factory where artists painted porcelain, screens and other objects. They were given models to work from, with a limited freedom of artistic expression. Nevertheless, Suro explored the New York City art scene. He started contacting dealers and gallery owners, including Rose Fried, Betty Parsons and Leo Castelli. As an art critic, Suro wrote the first in-depth critical articles on both Piet Mondrian and Stuart Davis in the Spanish language. He reintroduced the work of Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a to the artists within the Rose Fried Gallery circle, where he was asked to write the text of an accompanying monograph for Torres Garcia's 1960 breakthrough exhibition. Among the artists befriended by Suro in New York City were Fritz Glarner, Ronnie Elliott, Jean Arp, Stuart Davis, Adolf Fleischmann, Minna Citron, Bud Hopkins, Burgoyne Diller, Philip Guston, Charmion von Wiegand, John Grillo, Jean Xceron, Judith Rothschild, Lil Picard, Esteban Vicente, Raymond Hendler, John Hultberg and Lynne Drexler. In spite of his busy schedule, working in the factory and painting at home, he wrote for many international publications, including the Paris-based Aujourd'hui and the Madrid-based Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos, and he was a frequent contributor at El Caribe and other newspapers in the Dominican Republic. Through his job, he met Herman Somberg, one of his coworkers who was a quintessential New Yorker and a talented artist who happened to be a close friend of Franz Kline. After a certain reluctance, the latter finally agreed to meet Suro and the two became fast friends (later Suro reminisced about the encounter and ensuing friendship in an article written for Americas Magazine \\"Franz Kline Freedom and Space\\" in 1969). He frequented the Cedar Tavern in Manhattan, which he later called \\"one of the great universities of my life\\" and the place where he drank seriously along with his growing number of acquaintances. Another special friend was Philip Guston, who was fluent in Spanish. Neo-Plasticist world Many of the friends that he met early on through Fried were part of the Neo-Plasticist world. Fritz Glarner had been a close friend of Mondrian, a kindred spirit and the man who photographically documented Mondrian's New York City studio. One of Suro's most intriguing friends was the German Dadaist poet, writer and drummer Richard Huelsenbeck who was also a psychiatrist who went by the name Charles R. Hulbeck. As in Mexico and Spain, Suro changed his style once again, expressing himself through geometric abstract images and eventually going on to works that were decidedly informal and expressionistic. Group shows He participated in group shows at the Rose Fried Gallery, including the International Collage Exhibition in 1956. Barbara Guest, covering this show for Arts Magazine, observed, \\"Suro has carried the Dada idea along, with a frank assemblage of numbers which would have delighted le grand maitre Picabia\\". Suro also participated in many group shows, including the \\"International Avant Garde Perspectives\\" at the Newport Art Association in 1959. He finally had a solo exhibition at the Poindexter Gallery, in Manhattan, in 1962. The new paintings were both a reflection of his American experience, as well as his lifelong obsession with Spain several paintings were entitled \\"Tauromaquia\\", Suro's homage to Goya. Unfortunately, the exhibition coincided with a major newspaper strike and Suro did not receive a normal press coverage. John Gruen, in the New York Herald Tribune, among the few periodicals that covered the event, wrote: \\"A Dominican artist who has shown extensively in Europe but not previously here offers oils and collages in intensely muted colors flavored with textual elements reminiscent of the Spanish concern with the \\"earth\\". They are strong, bold and terse\\". Suro received a congratulatory letter from his old friend Vela Zanetti, who visited the exhibition and was both impressed and surprised by the new paintings. The art magazines had overall positive comments as well. Washington In 1961, events in his homeland once again changed his life. Trujillo was assassinated. Juan Bosch, Suro's childhood friend, was elected President of the Dominican Republic in 1962 and named Suro the cultural attach√© at the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Washington, D.C., as well as the Organization of American States (OAS). Suro remained in these posts for most of the rest of his life. Washington did not offer the same artistic stimulus as New York City, but his new job was more comfortable and better- paying. Suro continued painting and exhibiting worldwide into his old age. His painting went through new phases, constantly changing. In his last decade, he revisited old themes, often combining them and coming up with something new in the process. He also continued writing, frequently contributing to Americas Magazine, several Dominican Republic publications, including Ahora and Listin Diario, as well as international ones, including Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos and Acento Cultural. He was promoted from cultural attach√© to Counselor (1965) to Minister Counselor (1967) to Minister Plenipotentiary, Deputy Chief of Mission (1970) and finally Adjunct Ambassador, Alternate Representative (1980). In October 1996, he returned to the Dominican Republic with his wife. He was hoping to concentrate on his art, developing new ideas for paintings inspired by shadows; however, he died the following January. His funeral was attended by many friends, as well as Dominican dignitaries; three former Dominican presidents were present Salvador Jorge Blanco, Donald Reid Cabral and Juan Bosch who told the Suro family \\"Dario Suro was not only a great artist, he was a great Dominican\\". Recognition Suro was the first artist to receive \\"El Premio Nacional de Artes Plasicas\\" of the Dominican Republic in 1993, which was presented to him by President Joaqu√≠n Balaguer. The \\"Orden de Duarte, Sanchez y Mella\\" medal was presented posthumously to his widow by President Leonel Fern√°ndez in 1999. A comprehensive retrospective, \\"Dario Suro 1917-1997: Metamorfosis y Transmigracones\\", was organized at the Centro Cultural de Espana in Santo Domingo, curated by Ricardo Ramon Jarnes, Laura Gil and Marianne de Tolentino in 2001. The 4th Caribbean Biennial (2002), dedicated to Suro, was organized by Sara Herman, Director of the National Gallery of Modern Art of the Dominican Republic; Ricardo Ramon Jarnes and Laura Gil curated an accompanying retrospective exhibition. President Hip√≥lito Mej√≠a and Vice President Milagro Ortiz Bosch opened this biennial. Self- assessment In 1981, Suro assessed his approach to art in the following manner: \\"I have always been motivated by the existential condition of an object and not by the development of a style.\\" More recently, art historian and critic Alejandro Anreus, who often wrote about Suro, offered a more complete summary of his multifaceted career as follows. \\"Stylistically, Suro transformed the social realism of the Mexican muralists into a neo-realist aesthetic charged with an existential view of tragedy. By the 1950s he had already painted in a kind of pre-Pop Art when he completed his numeric series, and in the 1960s his abstract expressionist phase was a highly original one where the stain, more than the gesture, was his proffered mark-making strategy, while his palette was evocative of 17th century Spanish painting. His erotic period (1970s) culminated in an obsessive calligraphic use of thin, transparent layers of paint, where lines constructed the female sexual forms as pulsating, fully empowered entities with a life of their own. His body of work before his death was a fierce expressionism, where both the human and landscape forms were torn and reconstructed.\\"  Gallery  File:Numbers, 1958.jpg|Numbers, 1958 (Private Collection) Writings * Dario Suro. \\"Orozco en su sitio\\".

Formerly based in Moscow, relocating in 2019 after numerous restrictive Russian federal laws on religion, the press, and Internet regulation forced a decision to change locations, The NLR network broadcasts Christian programming throughout Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East via Hot Bird and Yamal 401 satellites; and by Internet radio at www.NLRadio.net. New Life Radio was configured as Russia's first satellite radio station, designed to transmit in a direct to home satellite broadcast mode to individual homes equipped with free to air satellite receivers. History New Life Radio (NLR) began as Russia's first Christian FM radio station, transmitting on 102.5 MHz in the city of Magadan, Russia (1996). Sensing the need to make Christian programming available in every community throughout the former Soviet Union, the station's management entered into a partnership with the Evangelical Covenant Church denomination (based in Chicago, Illinois) and HCJB World Radio (noted for developing the world's first Christian shortwave radio station in the early 1930s from Quito, Ecuador). The partnership goal was to develop a satellite broadcast operation in Moscow, as made possible by the launch of the LMI satellite, a cooperative satellite venture between Lockheed Martin (a US aerospace company) and Intersputnik, a Russian government controlled satellite organization that allowed for first time transmission of direct to home satellite broadcast signals throughout the territory of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. LMI was launched on September 27, 1999 from a Russian proton rocket from the Baikonour Space launch facility in Kazakhstan. During 1999, Dr. Daniel Johnson was assigned to coordinate the initiation of the radio service, and in that year, set up radio studios inside a restricted access government communication facility located on Nikolskaya Street, directly across from the Kremlin on Red Square in Moscow. As soon as LMI's testing period was completed, the satellite radio service, now known as the New Life Radio Satellite Network, commenced operations over LMI in January 2001. LMI was renamed ABS, after its sale to a telecom company based in Hong Kong. In 2012, New Life Radio Moscow delivered Christian programming in a non-denominational, non-commercial format to a global Russian-speaking audience on a variety of broadcast media platforms, including the Hot Bird satellite at 13 degrees east, the Tricolor TV Network, using the Eutelsat W4 satellite, and on multiple streaming formats at www.NLRadio.net. The radio network (2020) is registered as a non-commercial partnership organization in Odessa, Ukraine and is licensed as a mass media organization under the laws of the Ukraine as RADIO NOVIE ZHITTYA-New Life Radio. Its US-based radio partner is Christian Radio For Russia, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization registered in the State of Illinois, with offices in Jamestown, New York (www.CRFR.org).

Many notable people including a Supreme Court Justice, several congressmen, soldiers and inventors are interred in the cemetery. History As early as 1788, in the year in which he founded the town that now bears his name, David Mead recognized the need to establish a local burial ground. In 1811 he deeded land at the present day corner of Randolph Street and Park Avenue to the Presbyterian Church. In 1813 it was enclosed by a fence. At that time, it cost $0.50 to bury an adult, $0.25 for a child, and $1.00 for a \\"stranger\\". By the middle of the nineteenth century, the limited size of the cemetery and its location in the middle of the growing downtown district suggested the relocation of the burial ground. Several leading citizens of the community agreed to take on the task and arranged for the purchase of land parcels at the end of Randolph Street, some in Meadville itself and many in what is now West Mead Township. They were successful, and the new grounds were incorporated as the Meadville Cemetery. On March 11, 1852 the remains in the Randolph Street Cemetery were disinterred and moved to the present day location. Though they were placed in one large grave, the individual grave markers were also moved and may be found in a central section of Greendale. In 1853 the area gained a new name as Greendale Cemetery and designation as both a park and a burial ground. Though a municipal project, it had been created by private citizens for the community. In accordance with Pennsylvania law and its charter, it was to be administered by an independent board of corporators and managers elected by that board and operate on a non-profit basis as a service to area residents. An archway was built at the cemetery's entrance in 1865 at a cost of $315. In 1874, a receiving vault was erected for $2,100. In 1875, the house originally built in 1856 for the sexton was moved within the gated area, and designated the superintendent's home. Herman Munz was hired in 1875 to plant the grounds. Today more than 1,500 rhododendrons decorate the grounds. The cemetery offers lantern tours of the site during the month of October.

He has an interest in human rights, and is the current Director of the Solicitors' International Human Rights Group (SIHRG), a group he co-founded in 2005 and chaired between 2009-2015. Career Blackman qualified as a lawyer in 1986, opening his own criminal defence practice three years later. He was among the first solicitors, along with Sir David Napley, to take part in higher court advocacy after the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 was passed. In 1999 he was the second solicitor, after Laurence Collins of Herbert Smith LLP who represented the Chilean government against Pinochet in 1998, to appear and the first to lead and win a case in the House of Lords. He has been lead defence counsel in several homicide trials at the Old Bailey and elsewhere. In December 2009 he defended Paul Clarke who was charged after handing in to the police a shotgun he found in his garden. Clarke was found guilty because strict liability applies to possession of a gun, intention is not important. Clarke received a twelve- month suspended sentence. The case was covered by the media because of the controversy over the inflexibility of the law on illegal gun possession. In October 2012 he successfully defended Kai Taliana at the Central Criminal Court against a murder charge and his firm issued a press release drawing attention to failures in the investigation and expertise involved. In December 2012 Mr Blackman successfully defended Daniel Janik who was accused of murdering his friend Przemek Lepkowski in May 2012 in Tooting. The case was a rare instance of sudden and unexpected death from \\"vagal nerve inhibition combined with intoxication\\" following an incident of mutual squeezing of necks. He has an interest in human rights, co-founding the Solicitors' International Human Rights Group in 2005. He was part of a group of delegates who were commissioned by \\"Justice for Colombia\\" to visit Colombia in 2006 to write a report on how law in that country compared with international law. He was one of over 200 groups or individuals who endorsed an open letter sent to EU Foreign Minister Baroness Ashton by the Palestinian Grassroots Anti- Apartheid Wall Campaign. When he was vice-chair in 2007, SIHRG was part of a joint statement, along with the Commonwealth Lawyers Association and the Bar Human Rights Committee, expressing concern about reports of poor treatment of solicitors in Zimbabwe who took part in a march to deliver a petition regarding the arrest of two lawyers. He was part of a group who in February 2010 visited Syed Mustafa Kamal, mayor of Karachi in Pakistan. In October 2010 he submitted to the Chilcot Inquiry into the Legality of the War in Iraq a submission on the lack of a humanitarian justification for the intervention alongside other legal submissions from the Solicitors International Human Rights Group. He visited Syria in February 2011 as a member of a delegation sent by the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network to observe disbarment proceedings convened by the State controlled Bar of Aleppo against leading human rights lawyers in the region. In November 2012 he published a trial observation report on the politically controversial trial of opposition figure Vladimir Kozlov that took place in Aktau, Kazakhstan between August and October 2012. In July 2015 his report on the trial of Egyptian civil society activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah was published (\\"the face of the Tahir Square revolution\\") In March 2016 his report on the trial of two Myanmar migrant workers accused of the murders of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge on the Thailand island of Koh Tao was issued. Several recommendations were made for improvements to the Thailand criminal justice system. In April 2019 his joint report on the trial of Egyptian rights activist Amal Fathy was launched at a press conference in the European Parliament. In 2020 the Columbia Law School Human Rights Clinic in collaboration with TrialWatch and the Clooney Foundation for Justice Initiative published a report on the trial of two environmental activists in Thailand. Lionel Blackman was the expert contributor to the Report. Lionel Blackman is a Visiting Fellow at London South Bank University in Criminal Litigation at Masters level and lectures internationally on various aspects of the English legal system and the use of high technology in criminal trials. Political activities In 2005 Blackman was elected as a councillor in the ward of Woodcote, in Epsom and Ewell, representing the Liberal Democrats. He stood down in 2009. At the 2010 general election he stood as a Liberal Democrat candidate for the Esher and Walton constituency in Surrey. This is a safe seat for the Conservative Party, and Blackman came a distant second. Blackman stood as an independent candidate for the Epsom and Ewell constituency in Surrey in the 2015 General Election. His candidature drew attention to comments from the incumbent MP, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who stated that he wants to \\"scrap the Human Rights Act.\\" This became a promised commitment in the Conservative Manifesto for the 2015 General Election. As a result, Blackman explained in an article for the Solicitor's Journal, he felt compelled to stand against the Lord Chancellor as an independent candidate.

Date accessed: 30 April 2010.  Rationale  An SOA adoption usually results in multiple set of services built by various teams as part of automating different business processes spread across diverse departmental boundaries. Each project team might be following different set of standards and implementation architectures (for developing services) that are more relevant to the team's short-term goals and requirements. Although the built services might provide enough opportunities for reuse and recomposition within the same business domain, however, when it comes to composing services from different business domains, there tends to be an impedance mismatch requiring some sort of bridging or transformation logic in between these services. In a way, such services result in standalone solutions that defy the basic characteristics of service-orientation i.e. by not being enterprise- centric. Quite often such distributed service delivery efforts result in the development of redundant services as project teams are not aware of each other's requirements. In order to foster an environment whereby all the services conform to a single set of standards, the Enterprise Inventory design pattern is applied that results in a common service inventory that is based on a service-oriented enterprise architecture.Mauro. et al. Service Oriented Device Integration - An Analysis of SOA Design Patterns. [Online], pp.1-10, 2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2010. Date accessed: 5 April 2010. This automatically eliminates any redundancy and paves the way for maximum recomposition of services which could mean development of new solutions with reduced efforts and time.Thomas Erl.Introducing SOA Design Patterns[Online]. Date accessed: 5 April 2010.  Usage  Diagram A Two individual service inventories belonging to two different organizational departments built using different standards and based on different implementation architectures. The shaded services represent redundant services. Diagram B A single enterprise-wide inventory built around a common set of standards providing maximum recomposition opportunities and eliminating any redundancies. As depicted in Diagram A, the services belonging to two different departments, although belonging to the same organization, contain architectural incompatibilities as well as redundancy. An inter-department service composition is not possible until and unless there is some sort of transformation logic introduced in between these services. However, in Diagram B, the application of Enterprise Inventory pattern creates a standardized service inventory that is inherently interoperable. In order to be sure that all the services that are being built follow the same design standards, as part of the application of this design pattern, a service inventory blueprintService Inventory Blueprint needs to be created. Such a blueprint only consists of candidate services containing candidate capabilities. By coming up with such a service inventory blueprint, the overall scope of the potential enterprise-wide service inventory is established. This usually requires the application of the top-down service-oriented analysis. Apart from the creation of an enterprise inventory, the application of this pattern also requires that a technology architecture based on the current enterprise architecture needs to be documented as well so that the services could be built within the boundaries of such an architecture. Doing so guarantees service interoperability as well as behavioral predictability.  Considerations  As the application of the Enterprise Inventory design pattern requires upfront analysis, it is more suited towards organizations that have IT systems with well established procedures and documentation in place. If it is a fresh SOA initiative then creation of an enterprise-wide inventory would be rather easy and straightforward. Being an enterprise-wide initiative, it would be rather difficult for existing services to be adapted to the new design standards and would incur financial burden as well as require considerable amount of time. In some circumstances, it might not be feasible to create a single enterprise service inventory because of the sheer size of the organization.Howard Cohen, Josh Taylor.SOA in the DoD[Online]. Date accessed: 7 April 2010. This would also mean that governing and maintaining such an inventory might also become impossible as there are simply too many services to govern and maintain. Last but not the least, a host of cultural issues might prevent the adoption of a common enterprise service inventory. This could include hesitance towards giving up control the way projects are developed, reluctance towards adopting design standards that restrict efficient development of projects and extra burden on service developers in terms of keeping track of enterprise-wide standards and to keep a constant check as to what other projects teams are up to in order to avoid any redundancy.

He found himself obliged to grant sanctuary to Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx, when the latter was on the run from the King's Commissioners, who had been sent north to round up the ringleaders. When the Commissioners arrived at Bolton Castle he fled to join his father-in-law at Skipton Castle but the Abbot was rounded up and ultimately executed. Before leaving the Commissioners fired the castle. However, because of the duress he was deemed to have been put under he was forgiven and allowed to repair and reoccupy his home and retake his seat in Parliament.

Samuelsen was born in Copenhagen. Samuelsen was trained as a locksmith and machinist. In 1889 he moved to Aarhus. In 1890 he married Marie Marianne Florentine Jensen. They eventually had five children. In 1892 Samuelsen and his wife joined the LDS Church. From 1900 to 1917 Samuelsen served as a member of the Aarhus City council. From 1906 to 1918 he served for several terms as a member of the Rigsdag. His election was opposed by the local Lutheran clergy due to his religious beliefs. Samuelsen was the first Latter-day Saint to serve in a national legislature besides that of the United States. In 1908, Samuelsen managed to get included in the funeral regulation law allowances for Mormon elders to conduct funerals and even to do so in the funeral chapels. In 1912, he vocally spoke out against planned bans on Mormon missionaries in Denmark and was successful in getting it stopped. Then in 1913, by his bold challenging of the false claims that Mormon missionaries were part of the trade of white slavery, he got those accusations halted as well. During the First World War, Samuelsen served as president of the Aarhus District of the LDS Church. In 1919, Samuelsen was released as president of the Aarhus District and moved to Utah, where he settled in Salt Lake City.

Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51 (1998), is a United States corporate law case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the indirect liability of a parent corporation under CERCLA is to be determined by its control over a subsidiary's facility, rather than the relationship between the corporation and subsidiary. Facts A chemical manufacturing plant developed a significant pollution problem after many years of operation. The companies in charge of operations at the plant were wholly owned subsidiaries of, first, CPC International Inc. (CPC). Following ownership by CPC, the chemical manufacturing plant was owned by Aerojet- General Corp (Aerojet). In 1981, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered to have the site cleaned up. To reimburse the cleanup, the federal government filed suit under Section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(a)(2). Section 107 grants the federal government permission to seek reimbursement for cleanup costs from \\"any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.\\" The question before the court, was whether a parent corporation that exercised control over the operations of a subsidiary be held liable under CERCLA Section 107(a)(2)? Decision of the Court In a unanimous decision in favor of the United States, Justice Souter wrote the opinion of the Court. The Court noted that, \\"But a corporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of the facility itself may be held directly liable in its own right as an operator of the facility.\\" Notes See also *United States corporate law *Unilever, which acquired the Bestfoods Corporation in 2000 *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 524 External links * Category:1998 in the environment Category:1998 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:United States environmental case law Category:United States corporate case law Category:Muskegon County, Michigan ","title":"United States v.

It was founded in 1905 and is currently the only MD-granting medical school in the state of Utah. History The school began in 1905 when the Biology department offered a two-year medical course. The founding dean was Dr. Ralph Vary Chamberlin. In 1912, the medical program was established as a separate two-year medical school and became a member of both the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association. For the next 30 years, it continued as a two-year program; students were required to complete their final two years of training at other medical schools. The board of regents approved a four-year medical school in 1942. In the 1950s and 1960s, the University of Utah School of Medicine emerged as a prominent center for bio- medical research, thanks to the work of pioneering physicians and scientists such as Maxwell Wintrobe, Louis Goodman, Homer R. Warner, and Willem Kolff. To this day, the school maintains a reputation for strong scientific investigation, especially in fields such as genetics and bio-medical informatics. Medical education expanded significantly in 1977, when the University of Utah formed a partnership with Primary Children's Hospital, thus providing the medical school with a dedicated facility for teaching and research in pediatrics.Intermountain Health Care: Primary Children's History Retrieved June 17, 2018.

Biography Childs was born, on 3 January 1869, in the village of Carrington, situated some north of Boston in Lincolnshire. He was the son of the Revd William Linington Childs, vicar of Carrington, and his second wife, Henrietta Fowles Bell. He had no brothers or sisters, but had a half-brother and two half-sisters by his father's first marriage. He attended Portsmouth Grammar School and graduated from Keble College of the University of Oxford in 1891. In 1892 Childs served briefly as a secretary to Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, who at the time was Vice- President of the Committee on Education, the cabinet post that then supervised education in the United Kingdom. In 1893 he became a lecturer in history at the University College in Reading, being promoted to vice-principal in 1900. In 1903 Childs succeeded Halford Mackinder as principal of the college. He made it his aim to turn the college into a University, working to this end by attracting students from a distance with hostels and, eventually, halls of residence. He also raised funds from prominent local residents, including George William Palmer and Alfred Palmer, both proprietors of Huntley & Palmers, and Harriet Loyd-Lindsay, wife of Robert, 1st Baron Wantage. His first application for a charter, in 1920, was turned down, but a second application, in 1925, succeeded. In 1926, when the University of Reading officially received that charter, Childs became the first vice-chancellor, being born aloft by his students and carried around the grounds. Childs retired at the age of 60, in 1929. He died on 21 June 1939 at his home at Hermitage in Berkshire. Childs Hall, a hall of residence on the University of Reading's Whiteknights Park campus, is named in honour of William Macbride Childs.

In the mid-19th century it was one of the most prominent educational institutions in New York State. It operated from 1835 to 1902. History The Delaware Literary Institute was chartered in 1835 as a \\"literary institution for the instruction and education of youth of both sexes,\\" with a primary aim of educating ministers and missionary teachers. The first building opened in 1836 (Old Stone Hall) and enrollment was 45 male and 38 female students. In 1852, the student body stood at 409. In 1852, a large three story structure known as Ladies Boarding Hall was constructed. In 1855‚Äì1856, Chapel Hall was built and the New Stone Hall constructed to replace the Old Stone Hall that was destroyed by fire. Enrollment declined after the American Civil War and remained at about 225 through the next 30 years. Enrollment dropped in the 1890s due to competition from public schools. In 1902, Delaware Literary Institute succumbed to public and financial pressures and leased its buildings for use as a Union Free School. Chapel Hall and the New Stone Hall are the only remaining structures. Chapel Hall is used by the Franklin Stage Company, a local theatre company founded in 1996. Prominent graduates *Charles W.

The books was published in 2012 and created a major debate in the Faroe Islands and in Denmark about the problems the Faroe Islands were facing with population decline in the islands, where the biggest problems seemed to be that half of the young people who moved away to study abroad never moved back again; especially the women did not move back again. After a period of six years with negative net migration in the Faroe Islands, the country saw an increase in the population in 2014 and 2015.

Most values originate from sacred texts of each respective religion. They can also originate from members of the religion.Religious symbols representing multiple religions. From top left to right (Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Shinto, Sikhism, Baha 'i, Jainism) Members of particular religions are considered to be a prime embodiment of the particular religion‚Äôs values, such as leaders or adherents of a religion who strictly abide by its rules. Each religion has similar and differing values. Being religious does not indicate that certain religions are opposed to particular attitudes or encourage them. These values are also evident in secular society as it shares similarities.

Cort - Religion - 2001 - 267Understanding Latin Americans: with special reference to religious values... By Eugene Albert and in relation to human society.essay Dalai Lama Religions influence areas of living in society such a how they treat money. Money is used more ethically by religious adherents than those who are not. Care of the environment is also a religious moral based on values of creation. There are issues in society such as abortion which religious values impact as well. An adherent‚Äôs attitudes on homosexuality are also affected by religious values. If divorce is taken as a path in marriage or not is affected by how religious the individuals are. Even an adherents consumer behaviour can be shaped by their religion.  Origin of Religious Values  Religious values are usually based on values reflected within religious texts or by the influence of the lives of religious persons. Known as the ‚ÄòIndigenous Religious Values Hypothesis‚Äô, the origin of religious values can be seen as the product of the values held by the society in which the religion originated from. The beliefs of an individual are often centred around a religion, so the religion can be the origin of that individual‚Äôs values. When religion is defined heuristically, it can be used by individuals, communities or societies to answer their existential questions with the beliefs that the religion teaches. Values develop from the answers religions give to those existential questions.  Significance of Religious Values  Every individual does not consider religion to affect the actions and thoughts of a person. Though in some communities secularisation is considered dominant, it does not mean that religion is insignificant in those communities.  Money  Monetary Intelligence is greater among individuals who have a lower interest in making money but are more religious, along with those who wish to make ethical decisions. In a study by Thomas Tang on monetary intelligence found that making ethical decisions in the study was related to recalling the Ten Commandments, which are a Christian set of ethical teachings from which Christian values are developed. These developed values are uniform across many religions, though not all of them from the Ten Commandments.  Environment  The Roman Catholic leader, Pope Francis wrote an encyclical called ‚ÄòLaudato S√≠‚Äô. It focused on the environment and it was thought that it would change the attitudes of Roman Catholics. A study by Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research and Yale University researchers, found that 40% of American Catholics were only aware of the encyclical and the encyclical did not produce much of a difference in their reaction to climate change.  Abortion  A study done by Harris and Mills found that those who associate more with values of self-determination are more likely to agree to abortion than those who associate with values which reflect responsibility for others. Persons who associate with values of self-determination are not as religious as those who identify with values of responsibility for others. Joseph Tamney and his colleagues conducted a study to create a model representing the reasons why or why not individuals support legalised abortion in the American population. They mention that Judaism and Christianity possess values which limits an individual‚Äôs freedom. Christianity values the preservation of natural processes and human life. This is why adherents of Christianity oppose abortion.  Homosexuality  A study investigated the role of religion in how attitudes about homosexuality is shaped in 33 countries. Some countries have liberal policies while others punish homosexuality. They found that nations who value self-expression are more accepting of homosexuality than nations who are focused on survival. Nations which survival values are not tolerant of ideas that are not traditional. Being self-expressive allow more opportunity for personal religious beliefs to be displayed. Muslim nations have harsher punishments for those found guilty of homosexuality. Their attitudes are no different to countries that are Buddhist, Protestant or Orthodox whose penalties are not as harsh. Just living in Muslim countries encourages inhabitants, including those who do not adhere to the religion, to have these attitudes about homosexuality than living in a Catholic country.  Divorce  Religious values are against divorce unless during a situation of abuse or adultery. Studies show that this is due to the fact that religions benefit from marriage. The value of family is evident in many religions, especially Christianity. Christian teachings, which mainly originate in the Bible, consider divorce to be a sin. This is why marriage is considered to be sacred and in need of preservation. Religion is considered to promote sustaining marriage and traditional sexual norms. Being religious indicates that marriages are more likely to be stable and be happy. Religious couples are not likely to cheat on their spouses than non-religious, married individuals. Married couples who are religious are less likely to separate or divorce. A study held by Joshua Tuttle and Shannon Davis found that religion decreases the occurrence of infidelity in married couples. They claimed that this was because religions promote traditional sexual and marital norms and discourage extramarital sexual activity. They also found that being religious did not stop marital infidelity from occurring, but it also did not change the chance of divorce. Marital infidelity also does not appear to have an effect of the chance of divorce in long-married couples.  Consumer Behaviour  Religion influences consumer's purchase. Some religions do not allow the consumption of certain foods such as Islam, which does not allow pork and Hinduism which does not allow beef. Those who are adherents of Islam may shop without much thought and research of the product they purchase. Muslims are also more likely to try new brands and new stores as their religious philosophy is that the outcome of their actions are God‚Äôs will. Hindus are more likely to be rational with their purchases, which follows their religious philosophy. Adherents of Catholicism are more likely to purchase popular products and from well-known brands. Catholics are also likely to research their products and actively search for their desired product. Nittin Essoo and Sally Dibb found in their study that religious consumers were more practical in their shopping than devout shoppers, focusing more on the deals on the price and the credit which is available. They also found that adherents of Catholicism had a more demanding shopping behaviour compared to the shopping behaviour of Hindus and Muslims shoppers. When analysing Hindu behaviours when shopping, Essoo and Dibb described it as fatalism which sided with the religion‚Äôs beliefs of self-control, calmness, detachment and compassion, which the researchers claimed explained their passive shopping behaviour. The studies result suggested that Hindu consumers were less demanding, less thoughtful of their purchases, they were less traditional, less practical with their purchase and their shopping behaviour was also less innovative compared to Muslim and Catholic shoppers. This meant they were less likely to put effort into purchasing and were more accepting of poor service and high prices.  Gender Discrimination  In Australia, the Sex Discrimination Act does not allow gender discrimination in any organisation except in religious grounds. Due to this, religions are allowed to not allow women to perform certain duties or actions, such as the Catholic Church's refusal to allow women to be ordained as clergy. Woman are not allowed to sit at the front of religious places of worship in some religions. Some religions do not allow the entry of women into places of religious worship.  The Study of Religious Values  William Schweiker points out that religion, unlike philosophy, is influenced by the lives of persons significant to a religion, places which are considered important and principles which are unique to a religion, differing one religion from the other. Religious values can be studied with different approaches. Schweiker mentions five of these listed below: *Formalist approach ** When a group of values, practices and principles are considered to be part of a ‚ÄòReligion‚Äô, focusing on the moral implications on an individual‚Äôs life through this manifestation of qualities is called a formalist approach. *Sociolinguistic approach ** Studying the ways in which communities live. *Ethical naturalism ** Where propositions of ethics by the world is examined to define general ethical concepts. *Hermeneutical ** Looks at the perspective of traditions on any given situation. * Multidimensional ** Is similar to a formalist approach, only differing in that it is more perceiving of how knowledge and disciplines were made among the specific labels given by the formalist aspect of this approach.  The Practice of Religious Values in Society   Law in Countries  Saudi Arabia and other countries enforces Islamic law. The public practice of religions other than Islam is illegal, however private practice and religious texts only for personal use are permitted.  Pledging at Court  In Australia, witnesses and jurors who appear at court are asked to make either an oath or affirmation upon any religious text if they wish and by any god recognised by their religion, if they do identify with one. Court Services Victoria detailed the pledge on their website: > ‚ÄúI swear (or the person taking the oath may promise) by Almighty God (or the > person may name a god recognised by his or her religion) that the evidence I > shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.‚Äù > (para. 3).  Clothing  Female adherents of Islam are advised to wear the hijab in public (in-front of anyone they could marry), which is a veil covering their hair. It is compulsory in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. Some Christians wear a cross as an indicator to their beliefs.  Environment  The Mosques and Schools in Jordan are nearing 100% powered by renewable energy, using the energy for activities such as lights and heating water.  Charity  *Caritas Australia is example of a religious affiliated charity, based on Christian values such as justice and equality. * Shamayim is a Jewish animal welfare organisation, encouraging religious communities to go without meat for at least a year. * Jewish Initiative for Animals (JIFA) is another animal welfare organisation which focuses on Jewish values to promote ethical eating.

Early life and education Hombre comiendo ca√±a He was born at the Ingenio Porvenir, in San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Dominican Republic to Corsican immigrants. Giudicelli spent a few years of his early childhood in Europe, but returned to the Dominican Republic in the 1930s, living in Santo Domingo. In 1937, being aged just 16, Giudicelli married with a girl surnamed Vidal; they had 2 boys: Paul Giudicelli and √Ångel Giudicelli. Although he showed a talent and enthusiasm for art in his youth, it was not until 1948, at the age of 28, that he began formal training at the National School of Fine Arts. He graduated from the school in 1951. In a second marriage he begat a girl: Frida. Career Soon after graduating, Giudicelli participated in the S√£o Paulo Biennial and the National Biennial (Dominican Republic) in 1952. He held his first solo exhibition in 1953 at the National Gallery of Fine Arts, showing 70 works. Art critic Horia Tanasecu gave the exhibition a very favorable review, stating that the artist had \\"extraordinary talent\\" and brought \\"new energy to the national art scene\\". Tanasecu also noted the incredible variety of stylistic influences in the artist's work, including Cubism, Abstraction, Impressionism, Symbolism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Fauvism, Naturalism and Academicism. Giudicelli participated in group exhibitions in Barcelona (1956) and Switzerland (1957), as well as other National Biennials in the Dominican Republic. His second solo exhibition was held in 1957, and his third in 1959. The artist also began painting murals in 1959, receiving commissions for various public buildings. In 1959, Giudicelli was offered a grant to study mural painting in France, but was denied a passport from the Trujillo dictator government. Giudicelli's son Pablo, an embassy employee in Costa Rica, had refused to follow an order from the dictator, creating negative effects for the entire family. As a result of the political scandal, in 1960 Giudicelli also lost the positions he had recently obtained as both professor and vice director of the National School of Fine Arts, but was reinstated in 1961 after the dictator's death. Death Giudicelli continued his successful painting career until he died of cancer, aged 43-44, in East Santo Domingo.

The Missional Community doesn't exist for anything less than making disciples of Jesus among these networks or neighborhoods. The participants of missional communities find their primary identity of ‚Äúchurch‚Äù within the missional community, rather than a larger worship service or small group. In essence, this group of people becomes a close-knit spiritual family on mission together. General characteristics Missional Communities (MCs) are designed to be a flexible, local expression of church, not dependent on typical church buildings or church services. MCs have been described as ‚Äúsmall enough to care but large enough to dare.‚ÄùBreen, Mike & Bob Hopkins: Clusters. ACPI Press, 2008. Missional Communities may be called by other names, such as Clusters, Go Communities, Incarnational Communities, or Mission Shaped Communities. MCs are primarily led by laity and are ‚Äúlightweight and low maintenance‚ÄùBreen, Mike & Bob Hopkins: Clusters. ACPI Press, 2008. page 36 and most often meet 3‚Äì4 times a month in their missional context. Missional Communities place a strong value on life together, with the expressed intention of seeing those they impact choose to start following Jesus. With this focus, a Missional Community will often grow and multiply into other MCs. Missional Communities are most often networked within a larger church community, often with many other Missional Communities. An MC has leaders who, through a process of discernment, decide their mission vision and then invite people to join them in reaching that particular context. The leaders of the MC are held accountable by the leadership of the greater church community, both for what they do and for the way in which they do it (i.e., character as well as task). ‚ÄúLow control, high accountability‚Äù is one way to describe relationships between the Missional Community and the church body and leadership. Alex Absalom describes the focus of a missional community in this way: Since Missional Communities are meant to be led by laity, running the community can be spread throughout the group so that it doesn't make a few leaders do all of the work. This sharing of the work is a key ingredient and one of the main benefits of these mid-sized groups. People don't approach it as consumers but as participants. While some MCs meet in homes, it is not uncommon for many of them to meet in the particular mission context they are reaching into. (For instance, a MC reaching out to the homeless would meet on the streets with the homeless rather than trying to bus them to another location.) Missional Communities often have small groups within the larger body, with small-group leaders being held accountable by the Missional Community Leaders. The small groups work as places of support, challenge and closeness, as the wider MC gathering is too large for general sharing of prayer requests and the like. MCs will also gather periodically with the larger church body for what is referred to as a Celebration Service. This usually involves a time for corporate worship, teaching, stories and re-envisioning the wider community. The larger church body determines the frequency of these Celebration Services, ranging from every week to once a month. In an existing church, as opposed to a new church plant, regular Sunday services often perform this function, showcasing and celebrating what is going on across that particular church in their Missional Communities. More often than not, when Missional Communities reach the size of 30‚Äì40 people they begin to intentionally work on starting a new MC. As before, any new MC is driven by the presence of accountable leaders who have sought God for a clear and specific mission vision. This could mean sending out two leaders to start a new community, maybe a Small Group is sent out en masse, or even half the group stays with the current MC while the other half begins a new community. However the group is multiplied, the essential element is expanding the reach of the church into a new context. History Missional Communities emerged in England in the mid 1990s, primarily through the experimenting of the church St. Thomas‚Äô, Crookes in Sheffield. Although they were first experimented with in inner city London in the late 1980s, they became more fully formed when Mike Breen became the senior pastor of St Thomas‚Äô Sheffield in 1994. They were described as being multiplying missionary congregations and called ‚ÄòClusters‚Äô. The focus of the Clusters was on a group of Christians operating as a community together in mission. Leaders were encouraged to seek God for a vision for a new expression of church and, with training and support, they could be released to gather a team and pursue that dream. As St Thomas‚Äô grew, many MCs were planted into the urban center of the city. The church met for Sunday celebrations in a variety of large rented facilities, ending up in a huge disused nightclub, the Roxy, where the Rolling Stones had once played. In 1998, however, with only a couple of weeks notice, the building was closed down for breaking fire code, and the church was forced to scatter into their various MC gatherings for Sunday worship. It took almost a year for a new permanent home to be found ‚Äì during which time the original MCs that had been sent out had doubled in number, with many people coming to know Jesus during that year when the church had been forced to go into all the city. Gradually the stories about MCs started spreading, both across the UK and Northern Europe and more and more churches began using this church structure. In 2004 the Anglican church released a report, ‚ÄúMission-Shaped Church,‚Äù examining the viability and success of this movement within the Anglican church, including a foreword by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.Cray, Graham: Mission-Shaped Church: Church Planting and Fresh Expressions in Changing Contexts. Church House Publishing, 2004. Also, the European Church Planting Network picked up on this approach and hundreds upon hundreds of churches were planted as a result. Between 2006 and 2009, over 720 churches were planted across Europe.European Church Planting Network (ECPN) report This was the first time this had been done in European church history. In the mid 2000s this model of church began to spread to the United States. Early pioneers in this movement, such as Community of Joy in Phoenix, Arizona, Norman Community Church in Norman, Oklahoma and Trinity Grace in New York City were some of the first American churches to embrace this structure. Missiologists such as Eddie Gibbs at Fuller Seminary and Kent Hunter of Church Doctor Ministries began to direct both established churches and church planters to the UK to see these decentralized and reproducible Missional Communities. Mike Breen, the former senior pastor of St. Thomas‚Äô Sheffield who originated Missional Communities, moved to Pawleys Island, South Carolina and in 2008 began 3DM, a coaching entity that comes alongside churches of varying sizes to help them transition to this missional/discipleship model. With the emergence of 3DM within the United States, there was increased interest in these mid-sized communities. In November 2010, Mike Breen and Alex Absalom published a book entitled Launching Missional Communities - A Field Guide,3DM website where they related their experience with and approach to Missional Communities. In 2011, Reggie McNeal, a best selling Christian author, released a book detailing the world-wide rise of Missional Communities entitled, \\"Missional Communities: The rise of the Post-Congregational Church.\\" McNeal, Reggie: Missional Communities: The Rise of the Post-Congregational Church. Jonesy-Bass Press, 2011. The local churches choosing to make this transition vary largely in church denomination, but the largest percentage currently involved with this movement in the United States are Baptists, Lutherans, Assembly of God, Nazarene, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and non-denominational churches.History provided by personal interviews with Mike & Sally Breen, Alex Absalom, Bob & Mary Hopkins, Steve Cockram and Jo Saxton More broadly speaking, even the term Missional Community is seeping into the consciousness of the evangelical world of the United States as the first large-scale conference was held about MCs. Verge: Missional Community Conference happened in Austin, Texas on February 4‚Äì6, 2010 and sold out weeks before the conference. In 2011, Verge united with Exponential, the largest conference for church planters, where the theme was, ‚ÄúMissional Communities: Discovering Old Truths in New Paradigms.‚Äù. In 2012, the emergence of Missional Communities continued its prominent place at the Verge Conference, as well as seeing an expanded Missional track at the Exponential Conference and the Sync Conference at Charleston Southern University. Network and accountability If MCs are ‚Äúlow control/high accountability,‚Äù having a church structure that invests in lay leaders and empowers them while holding them accountable is of paramount importance. Perhaps the most widely used vehicle for this are called Discipleship Huddles, which is a group of 4‚Äì10 leaders. The frequency of these groups differs based on each individual church, but generally speaking they meet at least once a month and as often as once a week. Huddles are a place where leaders are actively being discipled in a community of peers, where they are held accountable for the leadership of their groups by their Huddle leader. The two central questions of a Huddle are: 1) What is God saying to you? 2) What are you going to do about it? By seeing that leaders follow through on the plans they form from answering both of these questions, a culture is developed of both high support and high challenge. Over a period of time, this allows leaders to cultivate and sustain the character, skills and spiritual depth needed to lead. As churches with Missional Communities tend to be far more decentralized than most Western churches, the network of these Huddles are essential to the unity and direction of the wider church. Usually the Senior Pastor will Huddle 4‚Äì10 leaders, these leaders will in turn Huddle 4‚Äì10 leaders, who in turn Huddle the leaders they are responsible for. As the church grows, multiplying Missional Communities and Small Groups, more Huddles are added as necessary. What most churches have found helpful is an agreed upon DNA in the language that all leaders use that filter down to their various groups. Most often this is the language of LifeShapes, a set of 8 Shapes that distill the teachings and principles of the Bible and Jesus, that were fashioned by Mike Breen as Missional Communities first developed and captured in his book ‚ÄúBuilding a Discipling Culture.‚ÄùBreen, Mike & Steve Cockram: Building a Discipling Culture. 3DM Press, 2009. A typical gathering There is tremendous flexibility in the forms of Missional Communities, since the intention is that they are highly accessible to the culture into which they are planted. They are anchored around the three core relationships of life ‚Äì UP to God, IN to family and friends, and OUT to the wider society which they seek to be a blessing to. In practice MCs do tend to certain things pretty regularly, albeit in slightly different ways according to their context, including: * Food ‚Äì ideally sharing a meal together * Socializing/ laughing/ having fun * Breaking Bread/ sharing Communion * Story- telling (i.e. testimony), especially of things people are grateful to God for * Bringing praise and worship to God * Offering prayer for healing and prophetic encouragement to anyone who has particular need * Studying the Scriptures together, especially from what God has been speaking to the leader (or whoever is leading that portion) about during the past week. * Praying for the wider community that you are seeking to reach, as well as for the MCs witness there * Planning practicalities for mission activities In addition to providing this list, Alex Absalom comments, ‚ÄúWe would summarize this as a 1 Corinthians 11-14 model, which seems the fullest unpacking of how a church oikos [extended household] would meet and express its life together. From what Paul writes, it is also clear that those gatherings were led in such a way that people who weren‚Äôt yet Christians could come in and be welcomed, without it throwing all the plans into confusion.‚Äù As well, a Missional Community will go OUT together in specific missional activities, to serve and witness to their place of calling. Such events need to be regular and rhythmic, so that the group sees this as an integral part of their life together. It should be no more a ‚Äòspecial‚Äô than meeting to eat together or pray together is.

Bolata is a locality located in the bay of the same name and is part of the Kaliakra Reserve. It is located in the northern part of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast near the village of Bulgarevo and near a former military station. The area is a wetland of great importance for few rare plant and animal species. The sandy beach is of natural origin and is unique for scandalous shores in the Kaliakra area. A small river has created a narrow gorge and flows into the swamp \\"Bolata\\" (Lake Bolata) with an area of 23 ha, covered with a vast mass of reeds. The limestone rocks in the area should be red in color, creating iron oxides in the clay that fill their cracks. The bay is part of the Natura 2000 Kaliakra Complex protected area. Bolata Cove Bolata within Dobrich Province Bolata cove is located at the northern rocky coastline of the Bulgarian seaside. It is 3 km to the north of the Kaliakra headland. The nearest settlements are Bulgarevo village in about 5 km distance and the town of Kavarna in 13 km to the west. The place represents a small cove with a semi-circular shape, featuring a sandy beach. All this is between a brick-colored high cliffs at the end of a rocky canyon. There is a very small river flowing into the sea. This is the only approachable place where the sea can be reached for kilometers of cliffs spread out northwards and southwards. History In the caves around are found remnants of an ancient settlement dated as far back as 4th century B.C. In the area of Bolata was also found a Maltese cross which testify to the foreign trade relation of the Second Bulgarian Empire with the Republic of Venice and Genoa. During the communist regime, on the right side of the canyon above the cove, there was built a top secret base. That's why few people knew about the place. There is some talk about a telephone cable that started from here and through the cove and sea connected leaders of Bulgaria and Soviet Union. The semi-abandoned buildings and a watch-tower can be seen nowadays on the plateau around Bolata. The Reserve Little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus) Common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) In the sky of Bolata cove passes the so-called Via Pontica one of the main roads (north to south) of the migratory birds. Bolata is the only reserve in Bulgaria that includes sea area in its territory. Many interesting species make their nests here. Among them are: *Little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus) *Little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis) *Common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) *Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) *Tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) *Grey heron (Ardea cinerea) In the area of Kaliakra and Bolata can be often seen short- beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). Of the herbaceous species, common ginger, bulbous meadow, common reed, other cereals, and others are found. Characteristic of the area are shrubs, cup-tufts, fights, jasmine shrubs and more. Several species of amphibians and reptiles are found, such as protected species of Syrian garlic, brown toad, spiked turtle. Above the lake passes Via Pontica, one of the largest airways of migratory birds throughout Europe. Therefore, nesting or passing waterfowl can be observed in the bay - a small water bull, a small diver, a tern, a large cormorant, a river tern, a white- tailed duck and other species of ducks and geese. Cracks and niches are important habitats for bats and steppe mammals, which are typical for the area, white-bellied white-tooth, small white-tooth, common gray voles and more. Plain dolphin can be observed in the waters near the bay  Culture and tourism  Remains of an ancient settlement and evidence of life dating back to 400 BC have been found in the caves of Bolata, as well as the Maltese Cross - a testimony to the trade of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom with Venice and Genoa. Also discovered are stone circles, sacrificial stones, rock caves - dwellings. The beach is also widely known as a dive site. A steep path to the north ascends to the top of the rock wall, offering a view of the entire gorge. Today the beach is popular with locals and tourists alike. It has fine sand and warm clean water. Behind the beach itself, however, the remnants of a once-public establishment and public toilet (which continues to be used today as a toilet) significantly spoil the experience. The human presence in this protected area has left a serious imprint on all sorts of junk.

Considerations of immediacy reflect on how we experience the world and what reality is. It implies a direct experience of an event or object bereft of any intervening medium. An example would be looking at a painting, losing awareness of the medium, and seeing the depiction as real. The medium is an important concept, and somewhat paradoxical, as it is both necessary and yet forgotten. Plato deals with a similar concept in the purity of experience. He tells us that speech is more immediate than writing, because the words emerge more directly from the speaker's mind. Immediacy also possesses characteristics of both of the homophonic heterographs 'immanent' and 'imminent', and what entails to both within ontology. Immediacy also relates to the philosophy of phenomenology, as they are schools of thought which both concern subjective perceptions of objects and time.

He has been a prolific founder of development stage biotech companies. Rosenwald has started many biotechnology companies who have over 100 licensed clinical-stage medicines. Many of those drugs were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as well as in foreign countries. One medicine was approved for Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a routinely fatal disease, that has cured many thousands of incurable patients over the last decade and continues that achievement today, marking a change to how this disease is treated. Another cancer drug developed by one of his start-up companies is today a near billion dollar-selling drug for prostate cancer. Additionally, that company was the first company to be acquired for approximately $1 billion after only phase 2 studies. Other drugs approved by the United States and many other countries include drugs for schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, obesity, influenza, and infant respiratory distress syndrome. Early life Rosenwald graduated from Abington Senior High School, located in southeast Pennsylvania, in 1973, and went on to graduate from Pennsylvania State University with a major in Finance and Economy in 1977, graduating Beta Gamma Sigma. Then he worked as an independent management consultant for health care companies from 1977 to 1979 before entering Temple University at their School of Medicine. After graduating from Temple in 1983, Rosenwald took an internship at Abington Medical Hospital and remained in private medical practice until 1986. At that time, he moved to Wall Street to serve as a physician/financial analyst, a specialized combination of fields which very few boasted at that time.The New York Times: Business People Career In 1988 Lindsay A. Rosenwald became a managing director of corporate finance for D.H. Blair & Co., a privately owned investment firm headed by J. Morton (\\"Morty\\") Davis. D.H. Blair underwrote hundreds of companies, many in the biotechnology industry. Several D.H. Blair brokers were indicted for fraud and the firm was shut down. Rosenwald headed a team of three physician-financiers who searched in the medical community for the latest developments that could be marketed with the help of private investment. They got in touch with hospitals, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, universities, scientific firms and research groups. In 1991, Lindsay Rosenwald founded Paramount BioCapital, where he dealt with fields of bioresearch and biotechnology. Since 1992, he became a NASD-member dealer. In 1995 Paramount Capital Investments LLC, a merchant and investment bank, was founded.

The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Vyking (Harold Carl Everson) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #1 (December 1986). The codename \\"Vyking\\" was introduced in issue #2. Vyking remained in the regular cast of the book, as the principal character and team leader, up until his sudden death in issue #6. Fictional character biography Harold Carl Everson was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the son of Justin and Hilary. Harold was an aspiring young writer, agonizing over how to best use his life and looking for a purpose. Some of his literary works received good reviews in his local network. After the Earth and its Paedia World Government began a savage war against the invading alien race known as the Horde, Everson decided to enlist in the Paedia emergency volunteers, based on an old biomass reactor plant, that was now utilized for junkyard, hospital and defense base. His zealousness also earned him the nickname \\"Rabid Beaver\\" from his colleagues. Still eager to contribute more to his country, Everson tested for the so-called \\"Morituri program\\" and was found genetically compatible, one of the precious few among thousands of applicants. The program subjected ordinary humans to a complicated scientific process and conferred them superhuman abilities, to be utilized as a weapon in the war of Earth against the Horde. However, a fatal flaw in the process also ensured the eventual death of its recipients, their organism invariably rejecting the process within a year of receiving, with always lethal results. Despite his parents' pleas to back off from his decision to enlist to the program, which essentially signified suicide, Everson signed up for it. He had already been fascinated by the cause of the Morituri, after reading a comic book which detailed the adventures of the Black Watch, the first batch of volunteers (now dead) who had undergone the process and had achieved the first major victory of Earth against the Horde. In the Morituri base, Everson watched a video of one of the members of the Black Watch, Woody, and his horrific death due to the Morituri effect. In spite of this, he went on with his decision, partly because of the obligation he felt to defend his planet since he was compatible for the process, and partly because he wanted to write a book, recounting his experiences as a Morituri and immortalizing himself. He was the last member of the first generation of Strikeforce: Morituri to undergo the process.Strikeforce: Morituri #1 The Garden Everson, together with his teammates, were later taken to the Biowar Zone Alpha (nicknamed \\"the Garden\\"), a specially designed facility, filled with traps, which would help the Morituri manifest their superhuman powers quickly, under extreme pressure. During the test, several members of the team almost died, in the process of facing the perils of the Garden. Everson pleaded their Commander, Beth Nion, to abort the test. After her refusal, Everson grew paranoid and began believing that Nion had been either bought or replaced by the Horde, and wanted them all to be killed inside the Garden. In his panic, he developed the ability to sense his fellow Morituri (a process he called \\"imaging\\"), as well as the ability to reroute any form of energy. After trying to help his teammates escape their traps, in vain, he sensed the console room into which Commander Nion was giving orders, behind a wall panel of the Garden. Mad with rage, he broke through the wall panel and attacked Nion, battering her. However, the Morituri managed to come out of the test alive and their powers manifested. Everson was embarrassed for his outbreak and apologized to Nion. He then adopted the codename \\"Vyking\\", as a tribute to his father's Scandinavian roots.Strikeforce: Morituri #2 Leadership Vyking soon became the unofficial squad leader, thanks to his ability to give orders and form strategic plans. He also started growing closer to his teammate, Snapdragon. He also began recording his book in a recorder. In the team's first official mission, in Kramatorsk, Soviet Union, Vyking was initially paralyzed with fear, plagued by insecurities about his ability to lead. In the end, though, he pulled together and proved his leading skills, and the team triumphed.Strikeforce: Morituri #3 Later, the team, by now internationally famous, was invited in a party in New York City, where they met the actors that would portray them in an upcoming soap opera. On their way there, Vyking began experiencing surges of power, a possible sign of the Morituri effect approaching. Terrifed, Vyking managed to suppress it. In the party, Vyking met the actor that depicted him in the series, Greg Mattingly. Vyking again proved his leading skills, when the team battled some Hordians who crushed the party. Shortly afterwards, however, they suffered their first casualty, when Snapdragon died of the Morituri effect.Strikeforce: Morituri #4 Death Sometime later, the team went for some time off in Holowood (21st-century Hollywood). While in a private party, Vyking sensed some Hordians being in the area, an indication that his powers were developing. Vyking left his recorder in the party and led the team to a secret group of Hordians who were stealing famous films from the movie archives of Los Angeles. They soon deduced that the highest earthbound warlord of the Horde had ordered a nuclear strike on L.A. and these Hordians were stealing the movies to later sell them in the black market for profit. Under Vyking's guidance, the team commandeered their ship and decided to move to the Horde fleet in orbit and strike there. En route to the Horde fleet, however, the Morituri effect caught up with Vyking and he exploded in a flash of light.Strikeforce: Morituri #6 His recorder was later given to new Morituri Commander, Yuri Pogorelich, to be listened to for possible valuable information.Strikeforce: Morituri #20 Powers and abilities Vyking had the ability to redirect/reroute energy attacks, albeit he never perfected this skill. He could also detect other lifeforms and their specific states, a process he called \\"imaging\\". Initially, he could sense only those who had undergone the Morituri process. However, later he could also sense the Hordians, possibly because he had been familiarized with them after fighting them repeatedly and/or because of the natural development of his abilities. As a by-product of the Morituri process, like all Morituri, he also possessed enhanced strength and resilience.

Both Pyrite & Marcasite are chemically Iron sulphide, but differ in their crystal structures giving them different physical properties - also known as polymorphism. Pyrite is more stable and less brittle than marcasite. Marcasite can also react with moisture to form sulphuric acid. These are the reasons why pyrite is used instead of real marcasite in \\"marcasite\\" jewellery. Marcasite jewellery is frequently made by setting small pieces of faceted pyrite into silver. Cheaper costume jewelry is made by gluing pieces of pyrite rather than setting. A similar-looking type of jewelry can be made from small pieces of cut steel.

Thailand is one of the large producers of modern marcasite jewellery in silver. Etymology Marcasite (m√§r‚Ä≤ka-sƒ´t) or mercasite an iron ore, a variety of pyrites. History Marcasite jewelry has been made since the time of the Ancient Greeks. It was particularly popular in the eighteenth century, the Victorian era and with Art Nouveau jewelry designers. When diamonds were banned from public display in Switzerland in the 18th century marcasite, along with cut steel, was turned to as a replacement. When Prince Albert died in 1861, Queen Victoria entered a period of mourning, requiring her entire court to wear black and avoid opulent jewelry.

The original proof is due to Ariel Rubinstein in a 1982 paper. For a long time, the solution to this type of game was a mystery; thus, Rubinstein's solution is one of the most influential findings in game theory. Requirements A standard Rubinstein bargaining model has the following elements: * Two players * Complete information * Unlimited offers‚Äîthe game keeps going until one player accepts an offer * Alternating offers‚Äîthe first player makes an offer in the first period, if the second player rejects, the game moves to the second period in which the second player makes an offer, if the first rejects, the game moves to the third period, and so forth * Delays are costly Solution Consider the typical Rubinstein bargaining game in which two players decide how to divide a pie of size 1. An offer by a player takes the form x = (x1, x2) with x1 \\\\+ x2 = 1. Assume the players discount at the geometric rate of d, which can be interpreted as cost of delay or \\"pie spoiling\\". That is, 1 step later, the pie is worth d times what it was, for some d with 0<d<1\\\\. Any x can be a Nash equilibrium outcome of this game, resulting from the following strategy profile: Player 1 always proposes x = (x1, x2) and only accepts offers x where x1' ‚â• x1. Player 2 always proposes x = (x1, x2) and only accepts offers x where x2' ‚â• x2. In the above Nash equilibrium, player 2's threat to reject any offer less than x2 is not credible. In the subgame where player 1 did offer x2' where x2 > x2' > d x2, clearly player 2's best response is to accept. To derive a sufficient condition for subgame perfect equilibrium, let x = (x1, x2) and y = (y1, y2) be two divisions of the pie with the following property: #x2 = d y2, and #y1 = d x1. Consider the strategy profile where player 1 offers x and accepts no less than y1, and player 2 offers y and accepts no less than x2. Player 2 is now indifferent between accepting and rejecting, therefore the threat to reject lesser offers is now credible. Same applies to a subgame in which it is player 1's turn to decide whether to accept or reject. In this subgame perfect equilibrium, player 1 gets 1/(1+d) while player 2 gets d/(1+d). This subgame perfect equilibrium is essentially unique. A Generalization When the discount factor is different for the two players, d_1 for the first one and d_2 for the second, let us denote the value for the first player as v(d_1, d_2). Then a reasoning similar to the above gives 1-v(d_1, d_2) = d_2 \\\\times v(d_2, d_1) 1-v(d_2, d_1) = d_1 \\\\times v(d_1, d_2) yielding v(d_1, d_2) = \\\\frac{1 - d_2}{1 - d_1 d_2}. This expression reduces to the original one for d_1 = d_2 = d. Desirability Rubinstein bargaining has become pervasive in the literature because it has many desirable qualities: * It has all the aforementioned requirements, which are thought to accurately simulate real- world bargaining. * There is a unique solution. * The solution is pretty clean, which wasn't necessarily expected given the game is infinite. * There is no delay in the transaction. * As both players become infinitely patient or can make counteroffers increasingly quickly (i.e. as d approaches 1), then both sides get half of the pie. * The result quantifies the advantage of being the first to propose (and thus potentially avoiding the discount). * The generalized result quantifies the advantage of being less pressed for time, i.e. of having a discount factor closer to 1 than that of the other party.

Though his fame is largely posthumous, he is considered one of the island's most significant artists. Dunkley's scenes are full of references to the unsettling political, economic and social conditions roiling colonial Jamaica in the 1930s and 1940s. The work reflects the racial tension, economic inequality and desire for self-government felt by Jamaicans and other Caribbean islanders. His creative output also coincided with the search for forms of \\"authentic\\" Jamaican expression that preceded the independence movement. Above all, though, Dunkley's oeuvre is a singular exploration of a complicated and often-dark personal and cultural identity. He is associated with a group of Jamaican artists known as \\"The Intuitives\\". The group includes Mallica Reynolds, David Miller Senior, David Miller Junior, Everald Brown, David Pottinger and Albert Huie. His work is generally darker in tone, and has been described as sharing characteristics with Wifredo Lam's paintings. Some critics see commonality with the work of French Post-Impressionist Henri Rousseau. Dunkley was deeply involved in the socio-political issues of his day, in particular the rampant racism that saw him become a pan-Africanist and an admirer of Marcus Garvey. Early life Dunkley's early life was filled with both adversity and adventure, which may account, in part, for his unique artistic vision. At the age of seven, an accident damaged one of his eyes, affecting his ability to learn in school. As a result, he was sent for by his father who was living in Panama. Upon arrival, the teen-aged Dunkley discovered his father had recently died and was buried the day before he landed. Deprived of his father's wealth, Dunkley started earning his own livelihood. Like many of his impoverished black countrymen, he sought work throughout the Caribbean, stopping in Col√≥n, Panama; Chiriqui, Panama; Costa Rica and Camaguey, Cuba. A banana plantation where he worked in Panama would later inspire a number of his paintings. He reportedly started out from Cuba for California to study dentistry when an armed upheaval took place. He lost all of his belongings, but was spared his life. According to his wife, Dunkley, who was a Freemason, sent out the Mason's distress signal, which was answered by a lodge member on a passing ship. Welcomed aboard, he signed on as a sailor, traveling to England, Scotland, North and South America and numerous other places. He may also have worked on the construction of the Panama Canal. He returned to Chiriqui, where he set up a barbershop and started painting in his spare time, encouraged by Clarence Rock, a prominent Panamanian photographer. Sometime between 1926 and 1930, Dunkley returned to Jamaica, establishing his barbering business on lower Princess Street in Kingston. He covered the entirety of the shop's exterior with small painted signs depicting flowers, trees and vines. H. Delves Molesworth, then Secretary of the Institute of Jamaica, was attracted by the paintings. A key figure in the early Jamaican art movement, the young Englishman encouraged Dunkley to keep painting. Later life and work While continuing to ply his trade as a barber, Dunkley maintained his artistic pursuits. Active for little more than a decade before his early death, his output as a painter was small. Less than 50 paintings are known, but they reveal a unique and compelling aesthetic. There is no clearly discernible development in Dunkley's work. Anticipating impending fame, the artist kept his paintings and persisted in refining, even overworking, them. Most of the paintings are imagined, surrealistic landscapes replete with hidden symbolism. The surfaces are delicate and tapestry-like. Fantastic vegetation, trees and shrubs with overblown flowers, are contrasted with bare truncated branches, in a way that encourages the viewer's understanding of them as phallic symbols. A preoccupation with the link between eroticism and death, the Freudian Eros/Thantos concept, is also in evidence. Small mammals, crabs, birds and often spiders with their complex webs, inhabit the gloomy woods. Human figures are rare, though human presence is implied by an occasional house painted in the distance or at the edge of a wood. Dunkley's most persistent motif is the pathway or road, which sometimes pushes through the vegetation to suggest great depth. In \\"Back to Nature\\" (circa 1939), the path, impressed with footprints, bifurcates to encircle a heart-shaped grave. A distinct group of less claustrophobic paintings are thought to be his last. In \\"Lonely Road\\", \\"Springboard\\", \\"Woman Feeding Fish\\" and \\"Footbridge\\", the typically dense vegetation gives way to more expansive vistas and clearer skies. The backgrounds are white rather than grey. Far fewer elements populate the landscape. In some, the black outlines of sparse vegetation are silhouetted against the sky. Though less confined, the works are still disquieting. Surreal touches, such as the isolated platform in \\"Springboard\\", leaves pushing up through the cracks in \\"Feeding the Fishes\\" and the unstable support in \\"Footbridge\\" contribute to the sense of unease. Dunkley was inspired occasionally by current events. There is a mixed media piece depicting boxer Joe Louis. In the \\"Good Shepherd\\" (circa 1938), populist politician Alexander Bustamante is shown gathering flocks of sheep, while in the distance a few straggly goats run away. When the Roosevelt administration built Vernam Field at Sandy Gully during World War II, Dunkley made a painting of the president. From a large piece of Lignum Vitae cut down for the military base, he carved a seated portrait of a proud Jamaican man and named him \\"Sandy Gully\\". Dunkley's small body of sculptures, primarily wood-carvings, are less accomplished than his paintings. In addition to \\"Sandy Gully\\" (1940), notable works include \\"Old Joe\\", an intense portrait of a black man clasping his knees while bent in prayer, and \\"Acrobat\\", a mahogany carving of a man contorting himself with his head between his legs and beneath his posterior. During his lifetime, Dunkley received some local recognition for his artwork as a result of group exhibitions. In 1938, a carving of a reindeer (since destroyed) won a prize at St. George's Exhibition in Kingston. The following year, Dunkley received a bronze medal for \\"notable contribution to the art of the world\\" at the New York World's Fair. Three works, \\"Back to Nature\\", \\"Jerboa\\" and \\"Pastures\\" were exhibited at the Institute of Jamaica's 1945 Survey of West Indian Painting, a show that also traveled to Canada. Four paintings including \\"Banana Plantation\\" were exhibited in London in 1946. Dunkley was in failing health for many months prior to his death. He passed away at 55 years of age, probably from lung cancer, on 17 February 1947. His large funeral was attended by both rich and poor. Posthumous fame Following his death, Dunkley's reputation grew. In 1948, he was honored with a memorial exhibition at the Institute of Jamaica. In 1951, his painting \\"Jerboa\\" was shown at the First Caribbean Exhibition in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A retrospective of Dunkley's work, with fellow intuitive artist Henry Daley, was exhibited in 1960 at the Institute of Jamaica. In 1969, the painting \\"Diamond Wedding\\" was shown at \\"Art in Jamaica Since the Thirties\\" at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. Dunkley was represented by two pieces, \\"Jerboa\\" and \\"Back to Nature\\" in the exhibition \\"Three Decades of Jamaican Painting\\" at Commonwealth Institute Art Gallery in London (1971). An exhibition of Dunkley's paintings and sculptures was held at the National Gallery of Jamaica, 9 December 1976 to 19 February 1977. With the resurrection of a fair percentage of his oeuvre in the retrospective and a subsequent permanent display of his work, Dunkley regained his position as a true Jamaican master. From 26 May 2017 through 14 January 2018, the P√©rez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) held the first major exhibition of Dunkley's work outside of his native country. The show was composed of forty- five works, paintings from the 1930s and 1940s, as well as rare carved wood and stone figures. The show, titled \\"John Dunkley: Neither Day nor Night\\", then traveled to the National Gallery of Jamaica, where it was on display from 29 April 2018 to 29 July 2018. The National Gallery's version contained work not shown at PAMM that explored the themes of tourism, immigration and the emergence of cultural nationalism during Dunkley's lifetime. \\"Daylight Come‚Ä¶Picturing Dunkley‚Äôs Jamaica\\" served as a complement to \\"John Dunkley: Neither Day nor Night.\\" It included rare photographs, artifacts and film footage from the turn of the 20th century to the Jamaican Nationalist movement, providing further context to Dunkley's output. \\"John Dunkley: Neither Day nor Night\\" is currently on display at the American Folk Art Museum, where it runs from 30 October 2018 to 24 February 2019.

Life Henry Scrope, a loyal supporter of Elizabeth I, was Marshal of the Army during the siege of Leith in 1559 which saw the end of the \\"Auld Alliance\\" between Scotland and France. He was appointed Warden of the West Marches and Captain of Carlisle from 1562 until the end of his life.\\"The Almain Armourer's Album\\", The Victoria and Albert Museum In April 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled across the Solway Firth to England after losing the Battle of Langside. She landed at Workington, travelling from there to Cockermouth and from thence to Carlisle. Scrope was at court at the time, but hurried north with Sir Francis Knollys to take charge of her. After a brief imprisonment in Carlisle Castle Mary was moved with a large retinue of servants to Lord Scrope's home in Yorkshire, Bolton Castle. Six months later she was moved on to Tutbury Castle. In 1569, in the abortive Rising of the North, the Catholic Northern Earls rebelled with the objective of releasing Mary, Queen of Scots from her imprisonment at Tutbury and reinstating the old religion with Mary as queen. As Captain of Carlisle Scrope was involved in the suppression of the rising. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1584. In September 1589 James VI of Scotland was expecting his wife Anne of Denmark to sail to Scotland. Scrope sent \\"a brace of verie fatt stagges redy baked\\" to Edinburgh, and sought out a company of her majesty's players who were in Lancashire to send to Scotland. The bride was delayed and these preparations were wasted. James VI wrote to Scrope on 22 October 1589 outlining arrangements for governance in Scotland while he sailed to Norway, especially as the Scottish border warden Sir John Carmichael was going with him. Scrope wrote to William Asheby, the English ambassador in Scotland, saying he could hardly believe the news that the Scottish king was sailing to Norway.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 157, 178, 181.

History The Rocking Chair Ranche was bought by The 1st Baron Tweedmouth in 1883. After his death in 1894, it was owned by his son and heir, The 2nd Baron Tweedmouth, and the 1st Baron's son-in-law, The 7th Earl of Aberdeen. The ranch was sold to the Continental Land and Cattle Company in December 1896. Owners The Hon. Archibald John Marjoribanks, the youngest son of The 1st Baron Tweedmouth, was sent to Texas to work as the assistant ranch manager and bookkeeper. Archibald was not paid by the ranch but his father gave him a living allowance of ¬£400 a year.Marjoribanks, Roger. \\"Coutts and Archie - The Honourable Cowboys\\", The Marjoribanks Journal Number 5, December 1998. Retrieved 22 May 2010 Lord and Lady Aberdeen visited Archibald in the summer of 1887 and found him living in a one-bedroom wood frame house which he shared with the ranch manager, J. John Drew. During their stay, the Aberdeens slept in the bedroom while Archibald and the ranch manager slept on the terrace. The closest township to the ranch was renamed Aberdeen after their visit at the suggestion of Archibald Marjoribanks. Archibald became engaged to Elizabeth (known locally as \\"Myssie\\") Brown, of Nashville, Tennessee, daughter of Judge Trimble Brown, to the disapproval of Archibald's sister, Lady Aberdeen, who regarded Nashville ladies as frivolous and empty-headed compared to sober and industrious Scottish girls. Nevertheless, Archibald and Elizabeth were married and, after the ranch failed, moved to Bath in Somerset, England, where they had two children. After Archibald's death in 1900, Elizabeth married Archibald's cousin Douglas Hogg, who later became The 1st Viscount Hailsham and Lord Chancellor.

The Fort du Replaton was built between 1884 and 1892 using an arrangement that anticipated the later Maginot Line fortifications, and resembles Fort Saint Michel near Toul. It cost approximately 2 million francs. Unlike a Maginot fortification, Replaton was enclosed by a perimeter wall and had surface barracks. The original armament consisted of two 95mm and two 155mm guns along a communicating gallery on the rock behind. The fort received concrete reinforcement in the early 1900s. A renovation project in 1930 added 75mm guns in place of the 95mm weapons. The fort was fired upon in 1940 and 1944. It is the property of the Association de la Travers√©e es Alpes.

Career In 1994, Lim began to start baseball and a promising player with a lot of potential. In his rookie season, Lim batted .250 in 29 games, and .247 with 15 home runs. In 1996, Lim produced .311 with 11 home runs and 76 RBI. During his seven-year career, he began to boost a career total of 345 hits, 47 home runs, and .257 RBI with a .266 RBI. Personal life On April, 2000, Lim suddenly collapsed at the second base against the LG Twins at the Jamsil Stadium in southern Seoul. Reports said that Lim collapsed due to a heart arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat and failed to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation on time. Although an emergency medical service vehicle arrived and transported Lim to a hospital, the brain damage he received from the incident was said to have resulted largely from the lack of first aid soon after Lim collapsed at the stadium. Poor first aid and the ensuing brain damage resulting from lack of oxygen to the brain meant there wasn't much the doctors at the hospital could do to help Lim once he was brought to the hospital. The former baseball player went on to spend the next decade in a vegetative state. His family later sued the Lotte Giants and LG Twins in April, 2003 for 800 million.

The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Shear was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #13 (December 1987). Shear remained in the regular cast of the book until his death in Strikeforce: Morituri #25. Fictional character biography Walther Feyzioglu was born in Germany, the son of Turkish immigrants. He grew to become an aggressive young man, partially because of the racism his family faced. In 2073, he was working in a factory in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey, when he applied to participate in the Morituri program, a scientific program which grants superhuman abilities to its recipients, to be used as Earth's soldiers in its ongoing war against the invading alien race known as the Horde. However, the process also had a fatal side-effect: it inevitably claimed the lives of its recipients within a year, due to an unsolvable flaw. Eager to fight the Horde, Feyzioglu applied for the process and was qualified as one of the few genetically eligible to undertake it. Thanks to the process, he developed the ability to disrupt molecular bonds from a meter away, for both inorganic and organic matter. Subsequently, he gained the codename \\"Shear\\" and became part of the third generation of Strikeforce: Morituri.Strikeforce: Morituri #13 Shear proved to be extremely aggressive and bloodthirsty in battle. To demonstrate he had no mercy for his enemies, he started wearing a costume based on that of 20th-century comic book character Punisher, drawing parallels between Punisher's lack of mercy towards enemies and his own.Strikeforce: Morituri #22 He also proved undisciplined and often defied his superiors, the Paedia World Government, feeling that the Morituri were exploited and used as expendable pawns. He also felt the team was used less frequently in battles than they should. Later, when one of the team members, Radian, was perceived as having gone traitorous, Shear killed him in retaliation.Strikeforce: Morituri #15 Later, Yuri Pogorelich, Commander of the Morituri, decided to appoint Shear the new squad leader of Strikeforce: Morituri, a post he fiercely declined. Despite Shear's wishes to the contrary, Pogorelich forced him to his new position, although the task was later given to another team member, Brava.Strikeforce: Morituri #19Strikeforce: Morituri #22 Death At some point, during a battle in which the team were protecting a TV station from the attack of the Horde, one of the Morituri, Backhand, exploded due to the Morituri effect.Strikeforce: Morituri #22 As a result, Shear was injured in the head. Unbeknownst to him, he began developing a brain tumor. Suffering from headaches, he also began growing increasingly paranoid and began suffering persecution mania, believing that everyone was involved in a massive conspiracy whose purpose was to annihilate him. He also believed that new team member, Scanner, was intentionally giving him these headaches, since he began having them after Scanner joined. Finally, in a psychotic fit, Shear murdered Commander Pogorelich. The team engaged him, and, during a confrontation with Scanner, Shear fell to his death from the roof where they were fighting.Strikeforce: Morituri #25 References Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987 Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Fictional German people ","title":"Shear (comics)"},{"id":"26152918","text":"The SIAI S.19 was an Italian racing flying boat built by SIAI for the 1920 Schneider Trophy race.

Background Edward MacLysaght believed that this name was a later substitution for √ì Maolchairill, a minor erenagh family based at Cloonkeenkerrill, north-east of Athenry in County Galway. They derived their name, though not their descent, from Saint Kerrill, the first Christian missionary in the area. Various members of the family occurred infrequently in late medieval church documents, the majority of them apparently clergy. It is now generally rendered as Mulkerrins, and still found in the Athenry area. Tugaid oinne √ì Maoilchiar√°in's single known extant poem is Tugaid oinne, described by O'Reilly as \\"a beautiful elegy on the death of his son. This very pathetic poem consists of one hundred and seventy-two verses.\\" He noted that as of 1820 a copy was in the library of one \\"John M'Namara, Esq.\\" The poem is notable for been one of the very few intensely personal poems of the period to survive. It can be compared to the notable De√°n oram tr√≥caire, a Thr√≠onn√≥id (Have mercy on me, O Trinity), by Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe, (?1210‚Äì?1272), who similarly woed the death of his children. This may be due in part to the fact that the majority of Gaelic poet's work was professional, concerned mainly with political events, history and praise-poems.

Other objects are also used for this purpose, including trash cans, ladders, ironing boards, and similar-sized objects. For curbside parking spaces, two or more items are normally used; for angle spaces, only one is needed. The practice of using parking chairs is common in snowy weather within urban residential areas of the United States, where vehicle owners do not wish to risk losing their vehicle's previously occupied space in its absence. Other spaces may be hard to find due to accumulation of uncleared and plowed snow, and the owner of a vehicle may have invested considerable work in clearing a parking space to free the car. This is common in areas where side streets are fully lined with parallel parked cars allowing only the center of the street to be cleared of snow, which then has the effect of pushing the snow onto the parked cars. This practice is especially common in the Northeastern United States (for example, in Boston and Pittsburgh) and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions (for example, in Chicago, where it is referred to as \\"dibs\\"). In Pittsburgh and Chicago, the use of parking chairs is considered to be an \\"iconic\\" regional practice. Use in inclement weather In snowstorms, vehicle owners with such a need mark the space as their own that their vehicle previously occupied after digging out the heavy snow that covered the vehicle and blocked them in. The legality and level of enforcement of existing laws pertaining to this practice varies by location. Generally, curbside parking spaces are public property and are available to vehicles on a first-come, first-served basis. Still, respecting these makeshift markers has been accepted by citizens as a common courtesy during snowstorms. The practice is often most effective when accompanied by the threat or actual occurrence of a \\"look of consternation\\" from a vigilant, often elderly neighbor who \\"keeps watch\\" in the vehicle owner's absence. While use is year-round, it is a particularly time-honored tradition in heavy snowfall accumulation, when a resident who \\"digs out\\" their spot on the street essentially declares ownership, which often goes unchallenged by neighbors for fear of retribution. The idea of the practice is that the person reserves the space from which they have freed their vehicle for future parking during the remainder of the storm and as long as snow remains on the ground. It is generally a Lockean recognition that the effort of the physical exertion of digging provides an entitlement to the space where the vehicle was previously located. But in some instances, spaces get reserved in this fashion even before a snowstorm starts. Origin The practice is common throughout areas of the United States susceptible to large amounts of snow and where curbside parking on residential streets is the norm, especially in the Northeast. The items used have sometimes been referred to as the Pittsburgh Parking Chair, due to their common use in Pittsburgh and its nearby suburbs. While such ad hoc parking restrictions have no legal standing in the city of Pittsburgh, common and long standing community tradition supports their use. As the \\"parking chair\\" is part of the culture of the city, local police generally turn a blind eye to these impromptu markers, which under legal jurisdiction, technically qualify as \\"abandoned furniture.\\"Homeowners Protect Parking Spots With Chairs; Can They Do This?, WPXI Pittsburgh, February 8, 2010 Photographic evidence of the tradition has been found dating back at least to the 1950s. It is believed that the practice existed earlier, as the number of vehicles on residential streets has exceeded the number of available spaces. The origin of this practice may be outside the United States, as it is also a common practice in southern Italy. Legality The practice has been outlawed in some places, including the city of Washington, D.C., where enforcement is strict and violators are ticketed. Some places specifically prohibit the practice, with levels of enforcement that vary. Sanctions against violators may include fines and confiscation of the markers. Other places either do not enforce or make legal allowances for this activity. In Baltimore, after the 2010 blizzards on February 5‚Äì6 and February 9‚Äì10, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that the city would not enforce an existing ban on the practice. She said that it could not be stopped, just like \\"people saying Hon\\" could not be stopped. Some places, including Pittsburgh, do not place legal sanctions against those engaging in the practice, but make clear that anyone has the right to claim an informal space that was reserved by someone else for their own vehicle, regardless of courtesy. However, it is a general practice around the city to respect the markers of others. In 1994, Police in Dormont, a suburb of Pittsburgh, confiscated the markers from 200 spaces due to excessive complaints. Pittsburgh retailers sell novelty \\"Official Parking Chairs.\\" In Boston, the law prohibits residents from saving the spaces they clear for longer than 48 hours from the moment a snow emergency is declared to be over. However, they are outright banned in certain neighborhoods of the city, such as the South End.What to do with your car when it snows, boston.gov. Retrieved June 7, 2017. In Aldan, Pennsylvania, the police chief confiscated all markers that were placed following the blizzards of 2010. He stated that he was enforcing a local ordinance in doing so. Criticism Most dense residential urban streets have fewer parking spaces than residents owning vehicles. Despite this, it is rare that all residents require a parking space at the same time. When residents use parking chairs or other markers to claim spaces, they effectively reduce the parking available to everyone, by removing the efficiency that first-come, first-served public parking normally provides. Furthermore, guest and work vehicles are discouraged from using available spaces when needed out of fear of retribution. Many citizens cite that despite the existing law prohibiting space savers' use after 48 hours after a declared snow emergency, residents still use them without penalty. This means that public property is being illegally claimed by an individual for their own private use. Disorderly behavior Even in cities where parking chairs are generally tolerated, such as Pittsburgh, local police make it clear that public street parking cannot legally be reserved. Citizens are explicitly discouraged from using objects to block parking spaces. Because parking chairs are considered abandoned furniture, they may be removed at any time. It is common for municipalities to forcibly remove the offending objects from time to time.

Harvey Rexford Hitchcock (March 13, 1800 - August 25, 1855) was an early Protestant missionary to the Kingdom of Hawaii from the United States. With his three sons, he and his wife started a family that would influence Hawaii's history. He had at least three namesakes in the subsequent generations. Life Harvey Rexford Hitchcock was born March 13, 1800 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. His father was David Hitchcock and mother was Sarah Swan. He was the oldest son of 11 children. He graduated from Williams College in 1828, and Auburn Theological Seminary in 1831. His younger brother George B. Hitchcock (1812‚Äì1872) also became a minister, and was active in the American abolitionism movement known as the Underground Railroad. He married Rebecca Howard (1808‚Äì1890) on August 26, 1831 in Auburn, New York, and sailed on November 26 to the Hawaiian Islands, as part of the fifth company from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. They arrived in Honolulu May 17, 1832. Also on this voyage were missionaries William P. Alexander, David Belden Lyman, and Lorenzo Lyons. His sister Elizabeth Hitchcock (1802‚Äì1857) arrived 3 years later and in 1836 married missionary printer Edmond Horton Rogers (1806‚Äì1853). They were assigned to start the first mission on the island of Molokai. He took a short scouting mission around the island in the summer of 1832, and in September held the first Christian service in the open air. By June 19, 1833, with the assistance of Lowell Smith (1802‚Äì189), a thatched hut was chartered as the first church in an area called Kaluaaha. Ka lua aha means \\"the gathering pit\\" in the Hawaiian language, the name of the ahupuaa (ancient Hawaiian land division) there. On December 6, 1835 a more permanent meeting house was dedicated with a stone base and wooden frame, about long by wide. From 1843 to 1847 they were assisted by Peter Johnson Gulick (1796‚Äì1877) and his wife. An even larger church building was dedicated April 3, 1844 for the growing congregation. This stone building with plaster finish was about long by wide with a gallery level above. Another home was built at a higher elevation called Maunaoluolu to escape the heat.

Banerjee is the third highest salaried professor at a public university in the state of California.http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=PROF-AY Research Earlier work from Banerjee‚Äôs laboratory identified the Son of sevenless (Sos) gene that links RTKs to the oncogene Ras. His laboratory has also identified novel means by which different signal transduction cascades combine to distinguish between neural and non-neural cell types. They have also made critical discoveries in identifying transcription factors and signaling components that are responsible for hematopoiesis in Drosophila. Blood Stem Cell Maintenance Banerjee‚Äôs research focuses on the maintenance of blood stem cells, specifically hematopoietic stem cells that are maintained within a microenvironment where signals from a niche are important for the maintenance of quiescence within a precursor population. Lack of such a niche-derived signal will cause loss of \\"stemness,\\" resulting in increased proliferation and eventual differentiation. His research examines this phenomenon in the Drosophila hematopoietic organ using genetic technologies available in this model organism. Results from Banerjee‚Äôs lab have shown that the \\"stemness\\" of these cells is maintained through the combined action of a Niche Signal, that is generated by Hedgehog (Hh), a local signal generated by Wingless/Wnt and a reverse signal from the differentiated cells to the stem cells. His team has termed this combined action the Equilibrium Signal. Several important concepts underlying Drosophila blood development have allowed them to propose this system as an appropriate genetic model for vertebrate hematopoiesis, and these molecular mechanisms are being explored in the laboratory. Stress Response systems Banerjee‚Äôs studies have led to the investigation of multiple stress response systems. Myeloid blood cells are ideal for the study of response to many kinds of stresses. Hypoxia-related factors and free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role both in hematopoietic development and in stress response. Similarly, his lab has found that the NF-Œ∫B derived inflammatory response plays a major role in the way blood cells respond to injury at distant sites. Banerjee‚Äôs emerging view from these studies is that basic developmental mechanisms are co-opted again for stress, injury and inflammatory responses by the myeloid hematopoietic system. Genetic analysis will allow his team to understand the interrelationship between these important biological phenomena that have great relevance to diseases and disorders in humans. Metabolic control in Cancer pathways Banerjee and his researchers are also interested in the study of metabolic control in cancer pathways. In the past, his lab has identified components of signal transduction pathways that participate in oncogenesis. In addition, they have examined the role of the mitochondrion in controlling cell cycle, particularly that when cells become transformed they choose alternate means of metabolism (a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect). Also of interest to Banerjee and his team is studying the effect of signal transduction pathways on the control of cellular metabolism and the proper balance between cellular growth and metabolism that goes awry in cancer.

Dealer of Chaim Soutine and Amedeo Modigliani, he was one of the first to organize African art exhibitions. He also bought and sold many works from cutting edge artists of the time, such as Henri Matisse, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Pablo Picasso, and Giorgio de Chirico.  Life  Being from modest origins, Paul Guillaume worked in a garage. He found African sculptures which he displayed. This aroused the attention of Guillaume Apollinaire, who in turn introduced him to many of the artists of the beginning of the century in France. He soon organized important exhibitions, such as the Premi√®re Exposition d‚ÄôArt N√®gre et d‚ÄôArt Oc√©anien, on 13‚Äì19 May 1919, with a catalogue by Henri Clouzot and additional text by Apollinaire. Apollinaire, who died the previous year, had also collaborated with Paul Guillaume on the pioneering study Sculptures N√®gres in 1917.Lemke, Primitive Modernism, 1998, pp.35‚Äì41: Paul Guillaume. 'A New Aesthetic', 1919. This exhibition ‚Äì drawn from Guillaume's private collection ‚Äì placed African art at the heart of Modernism. After his death, his wife Domenica married architect Jean Walter and continued Guillaume's collection, selling his most \\"extreme\\" paintings and acquiring impressionist paintings. After her own death, this collection of 20th-century paintings became part of the Mus√©e de l'Orangerie in Paris. Domenica was once accused of the murder of Paul Guillaume, who died early and suspiciously. Some speculate that she was cleared of all charges in exchange for giving the collection to the French state after her death.

It was released on November 27, 2009, through Core Contents Media. T-ara sought to showcase \\"two different charms\\" through Absolute First Album, one embracing a \\"trendy\\" image and the other leaning towards a \\"classic\\" aesthetic. The result is a modern dance record with traces of retro influences. Absolute First Album features contributions by Shinsadong Tiger, Cho Young-soo, Choi Kyu-sung (now of Black Eyed Pilseung), Wheesung and \\"Hitman\\" Bang. The album was preceded by the hit single \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\", with its two lead tracks, \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\" and \\"Like the First Time\\", becoming commercial successes as well. \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\" was a breakthrough single for T-ara, further attaining recognition as one of their signature songs. Absolute First Album peaked at number two on the Gaon Chart and has received positive reviews. The success of Absolute First Album lead to T-ara's newcomer wins at the Golden Disc and Seoul Music Awards. The album was re- released as Breaking Heart on February 23, 2010, spawning \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" which became T-ara's first number-one single. The reissue was nominated for Disk Bonsang and Popularity Award at the Golden Disc Awards. Background and promotion T-ara was formed by Core Contents Media CEO Kim Kwang-soo, and prior to commencing their activities as a sextet, two members bowed out after contributing a song to the Cinderella Man soundtrack, citing creative differences. The label brought in three new members and released their debut single \\"Lie\\" (, Geojitmal) on July 27, 2009. The song was composed by Cho Young-soo, who would become a frequent collaborator of the group. T-ara's debut was made amid an influx of girl groups on the Korean pop music scene, and a writer for weekly magazine SisaIN remarked that the old-school trot influence of \\"Lie\\" did little to appeal to core consumers of the girl group market; those who found nostalgia in 1990s groups like S.E.S. and Fin.K.L. The group utilized a \\"girlish and pure\\" image during its run. T-ara would find wider success with their Supernova collaboration \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\", a track influenced by southern hip hop. The single was marketed as a \\"180-degree transformation\\" of the group, who took on a \\"sexier\\" image compared to their debut. In October 2009, the group revealed their plans for a mini-album release in the coming months. Expanding into a full-length studio album, Absolute First Album was formally announced days prior to its late November release. Core Contents Media brought on Shinsadong Tiger and \\"Hitman\\" Bang to produce songs for the album. The marketing for Absolute First Album revolved around its dual concepts; with T-ara's intent to appeal through \\"two different charms\\", the group released two lead singles simultaneously: \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\" was backed by a \\"charismatic\\" image, whereas \\"Like the First Time\\" (, Cheoeum Cheoreom) was billed as \\"colorful yet classic\\". Absolute First Album was digitally released on November 27, 2009. A physical release followed on December 4, 2009.

Nearly 9,000 respondents from Melon, Cyworld, and Soribada, among others, were given the choice between \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\" and \\"Like the First Time\\", the latter of which won the poll by 53 percent. However, management proceeded with promotions for \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\" as the label intended to present a \\"180-degree transformation\\" of T-ara's image. The group began performing on Korea's televised music programs with the December 4, 2009, broadcast of Music Bank. \\"Like the First Time\\" was subsequently promoted in January 2010, yet their appearances quickly ceased as main vocalist So-yeon contracted H1N1, as did promotions for Absolute First Album as a whole.

Composition  Absolute First Album is primarily a dance-pop and electronic record. Member So-yeon remarked that though \\"idol music [follows] the latest trend\\", adult listeners would be \\"at ease\\" with songs such as \\"Like the First Time\\", \\"Apple is A\\" or \\"You You You\\" (, Neo Neo Neo), as they have ppong (ÎΩï) melodies that \\"stimulate emotion\\". Its lead single, \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\", is billed as a \\"trendy\\" dance song with a \\"funky\\" rhythm; Spin magazine describes it as \\"robotic\\". The song is one of several that feature repetitive hooks, including \\"Tic Tic Toc\\". The album dips into \\"retro\\" territory as evident on \\"Lie\\", which is derived from trot, and \\"Like the First Time\\", which employs 1980s influences. T-ara sings in falsetto on the latter track, and parts of its electronic production is \\"reminiscent\\" of Aphex Twin and Humming Urban Stereo. Furthermore, \\"Like the First Time\\" has been compared to \\"In for the Kill\\" by English synthpop act La Roux. \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" (, Neo Ttaemune Michyeo), from the Breaking Heart re-issue, is an \\"edgy\\" electropop song which has received comparisons to \\"If U Seek Amy\\" by American singer Britney Spears. It has been called a \\"song without breaks\\" and is highlighted for the \\"important key role\\" that synthesizers play in \\"creating a hook song\\". Elsewhere, T-ara explores R&B; on \\"Falling U\\", southern hip hop on \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\", and house music on \\"TTL Listen 2\\".  Singles  Absolute First Album collects each T-ara single prior to its release, though they were not utilized to promote the album directly. \\"Lie\\" was released on July 27, 2009, as a maxi single containing four tracks: \\"Lie (Part 1)\\" and \\"Lie (Part 2)\\", a ballad rendition of \\"Lie\\", and \\"Wanna Play?\\". The songs were re-titled for inclusion on Absolute First Album, with \\"Lie (Part 2)\\" omitted completely. A music video was produced for each song: in \\"Lie (Part 1)\\", the members are coupled with actor Yoo Seung-ho; \\"Lie (Part 2)\\" features the group performing at a waterpark, also known as the \\"Summer\\" version. \\"Lie (Ballad Ver.)\\" was used to promote the MBC horror series Soul, which stars member Ji-yeon. Actress Lim Ju-eun reprises her role as Ji-yeon's twin sister in the music video. \\"Wanna Play?\\" (; Norabollae?) showcases T-ara's \\"powerful\\" dance skills in \\"intense\\" black, white and red. \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\" was released on September 15, 2009; a collaboration with T-ara's labelmates Supernova. The two groups formed a project unit consisting of Eun- jung, So-yeon, Hyo-min, and Ji-yeon with Kwang-su, Ji-hyuk, and Geon-il; the single was Supernova's first release in two years. Qri stars in the \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\" music video. The success of \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\" prompted Core Contents Media to produce the sequel entitled \\"TTL Listen 2\\" with participation from all members of both groups. Originally set for release on October 13, 2009; \\"TTL Listen 2\\" was pushed forward to October 9, 2009, due to the popularity of the original song. The groups performed \\"TTL Listen 2\\" for the first time at the annual Dream Concert on October 10, 2009. Nami Tamaki released a Japanese cover of \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\" with Supernova in 2011. \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\" and \\"Like the First Time\\" were released simultaneously with the album on November 27, 2009. \\"Bo Peep Bo Peep\\" was a breakthrough for the group, with its cat dance becoming a craze in the country. The single peaked at number four upon the advent of the Gaon charts in January 2010.Positions on the Gaon Digital Chart:   \\"Like the First Time\\" was successful for T-ara as well, it charted at number ten and both singles sold more than 1.6 million copies each in 2010.Cumulative sales for \\"Like the First Time\\": * The music video for \\"Like the First Time\\" features the group transforming member Hyo-min into a \\"sophisticated\\" version of herself.  Breaking Heart  In early February 2010, it was announced that T-ara would be re-releasing their album with two new songs in order to thank their fans for the success of their first album. ‚ÄòÌôúÎèô Ï°∞Í∏∞Ï¢ÖÎ£å‚Äô Ìã∞ÏïÑÎùº, 2Ïõî26Ïùº ‚ÄòÎÑàÎïåÎ¨∏Ïóê ÎØ∏Ï≥ê‚Äô Ïª¥Î∞± (T-ara to come back with \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\"). Newsen. February 3, 2010. Entitled Breaking Heart, the reissue centers around a \\"temptation of the devil\\" concept. Initial concept photos typo-ed the release as Braking Heart. Breaking Heart was physically released on March 3, 2010, in two editions: a standard, and a first press edition with a 56-page photobook. This edition was limited to 6,000 copies. The album was subsequently released in Taiwan as a CD and DVD package, with pre-orders that include a file folder. The lead single, \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" (, Neo Ttaemune Michyeo), was penned by singer-songwriter Wheesung, with music by Cho Young-soo and Kim Tae-hyun.

Robbie Daw of Idolator drew comparisons to American singer Britney Spears, commenting: \\"the \\"Womanizer\\" beat, the \\"If U Seek Amy\\" melody and the wardrobe that looks like it was stolen from the storage unit housing the \\"...Baby One More Time\\" video shoot memorabilia. [...] You know, the line \\"you empower me, sexy shadow\\" is simply just not used enough in pop songs these days. So props for that, T-ara.\\" Filming for the music video, directed by Cha Eun-taek, began on February 18, 2010, in a Namyangju, Gyeonggi studio. Member Ji-yeon suffered a knee ligament injury during its production, causing the other members to end their solo shoots with Ji-yeon finishing hers the next morning. \\"You Drive me Crazy\\" peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart; holding its position for two weeks, it sold 3 million copies by the end of 2010 and ranked at number sixteen on the annual chart.Cumulative sales for \\"I Go Crazy Because of You\\": * T-ara began dual promotions for their second single, \\"I'm in Pain\\" (, Naega Neomu Apa), with the March 11, 2010, broadcast of M! Countdown. It was performed alongside \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\", with the music video premiering on March 15, 2010. Two alternate versions of the video were further released, and \\"I'm in Pain\\" peaked at number 31 on the Gaon, selling 1.2 million copies by the end of 2010.Cumulative sales for \\"I'm in Pain\\": *  Critical reception  The album has received generally positive reviews. A columnist for Sohu Music marked Absolute First Album as a \\"clear improvement\\" over their debut single, yet criticized its lack of identity, opining that though T-ara were able to follow popular trends, they had yet to find a suitable music style. Nevertheless, the reviewer picked \\"Falling U\\" as a standout track. In a more negative review, Seo Jung-min of K-pop Archive agreed that their music \\"can't be considered to have its own grammar\\", and called the album's sound \\"mechanical and [simplistic]\\". Seo further expressed their ambivalence towards girl group hook songs \\"flooding\\" the Korean pop music scene in 2009. A writer for Sina Entertainment stated that the album was \\"full of youthfulness\\" and \\"T-ara's color\\". Similarly, a staff writer for Bugs! remarked that the album \\"[makes] you feel the charm of T-ara\\" across its fourteen tracks; singling out the \\"sweet and refreshing\\" \\"Apple is A\\", and \\"body shaker\\" \\"Tic Tic Toc\\". Reviewing the Breaking Heart reissue, a Bugs! staff writer calls the album a \\"turning point showing the essence of fresh electronic music\\", in addition to naming the album's slower offerings such as \\"Good Person\\" and \\"Falling U\\" as high quality songs. Writing for Kpopstarz, Jesse Lent commended \\"Like the First Time\\" for its enduring appeal. Lent highlighted the \\"ethereal restraint\\" in T-ara's vocals, which \\"seems to be out of fashion in an industry built on one-upmanship\\", comparing their technique to that of Kate Bush and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Members Qri, Hyo-min, and Eun-jung have named \\"Like the First Time\\" as their all-time favorite track. In 2017, Jacques Peterson of SBS PopAsia named \\"TTL (Time to Love)\\", \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" and \\"Like the First Time\\" as among the group's best singles. Peterson previously opined that Absolute First Album \\"still stands as one of the best, if not the best, Korean girl group album of the past five years\\". In 2018, SBS PopAsia listed Absolute First Album as one of 10 \\"Essential Modern K-pop Albums You Need to Hear\\".  Commercial performance  Absolute First Album recorded 25,000 in pre-orders, ranking number one on the Hanteo real-time charts for three consecutive days. The album peaked at number two on the Gaon album chart.Positions on the Gaon Album Chart: * The Breaking Heart re-issue similarly peaked at number two,Positions on the Gaon Album Chart: * and sold 40,695 copies by the end of 2010.

It is closely related to Vermeer's The Astronomer, for instance using the same model in the same dress, and has sometimes been considered a pendant painting to it. A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material. Description The Astronomer has been considered a pendant to The Geographer This is one of only three paintings Vermeer signed and dated (the other two are The Astronomer and The Procuress). The geographer, dressed in a Japanese- style robe then popular among scholars,Wheelock (2000) is shown to be \\"someone excited by intellectual inquiry\\", with his active stance, the presence of maps, charts, a globe and books, as well as the dividers he holds in his right hand, according to Arthur Wheelock Jr. \\"The energy in this painting [...] is conveyed most notably through the figure's pose, the massing of objects on the left side of the composition, and the sequence of diagonal shadows on the wall to the right.\\"Wheelock (1995) Vermeer made several changes in the painting that enhance the feeling of energy in the picture: the man's head was originally in a different position to the left of where the viewer now sees it, indicating the man perhaps was looking down, rather than peering out the window; the dividers he holds in his hand were originally vertical, not horizontal; a sheet of paper was originally on the small stool at the lower right, and removing it probably made that area darker. Details of the man's face are slightly blurred, suggesting movement (also a feature of Vermeer's Mistress and Maid), according to Serena Carr. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps squinting in the sunlight or an indication of intense thinking. Carr asserts that the painting depicts a \\"flash of inspiration\\" or even \\"revelation\\". The drawn curtain on the left and the position of the oriental carpet on the table --pushed back--are both symbols of revelation. \\"He grips a book as if he's about to snatch it up to corroborate his ideas.\\"Cant (2009) Faust depicted in an etching by Rembrandt (c. 1650). Faust, also a scholar, is depicted in the same pose as The Geographer, although facing in roughly the opposite direction. The globe was published in Amsterdam in 1618 by Jodocus Hondius. Terrestrial and celestial globes were commonly sold together, and the celestial globe in The Astronomer \\"was also a Hondius (Hendrick rather than Judocus)\\", another indication that the two paintings were created as pendant pieces, according to Cant. The globe is turned toward the Indian Ocean, where the Dutch East India Company was then active. Vermeer used an impasto technique to apply pointill√© dots, not to indicate light reflected more strongly on certain points but to emphasize the dull ochre cartouche \\"frame\\" printed on the globe. Since the globe can be identified, we know the decorative cartouche includes a plea for information for future editions-- reflecting the theme of revelation in the painting. Vermeer's possible model, Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek, painted two decades later by Jan Verkolje The cartographic objects surrounding the man are some of the actual items a geographer would have: the globe, the dividers the man holds, a cross-staff (hung on the center post of the window), used to measure the angle of celestial objects like the sun or stars, and the chart the man is using, which (according to one scholar, James A. Welu) appears to be a nautical chart on vellum. The sea chart on the wall of \\"all the Sea coasts of Europe\\" has been identified as one published by Willem Jansz Blaeu. This accuracy indicates Vermeer had a source familiar with the profession. The Astronomer, which seems to form a pendant with this painting, shows a similar, sophisticated knowledge of cartographic instruments and books, and the same young man modeled for both. That man himself may have been the source of Vermeer's correct display of surveying and geographical instruments, and possibly of his knowledge of perspective. Wheelock and others assert the model/source was probably Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), a contemporary of Vermeer who was also born in Delft. The families of both men were in the textile business, and both families had a strong interest in science and optics. A \\"microscopist\\", van Leeuwenhoek was described after his death as being so skilled in \\"navigation, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and natural science ... that one can certainly place him with the most distinguished masteres of the art.\\" Another image of van Leeuwenhoek (by the Delft artist Jan Verkolje) about 20 years later shows a broad face and straight nose, similar to Vermeer's model. At the time Vermeer painted the two works, the scientist would have been about 36 years old. He would have been actively studying for his examination for surveyor, which he passed on February 4, 1669. There is no documentary evidence for any kind of relationship between the two men during Vermeer's lifetime, although in 1676, van Leeuwenhoek was appointed a trustee for Vermeer's estate. The pose of the figure in Vermeer's painting \\"takes up precisely the position of Faust in Rembrandt's famous etching\\" (although facing the opposite direction), according to Lawrence Gowing. Similar arrangements can be found in drawings by Nicolaes Maes.Gowing (1970) Provenance and exhibitions A less-detailed image of the painting, with more accurate coloring 1720 catalog listing the work. For much of the painting's early history (until 1797), it was owned together with The Astronomer, which it strongly resembles, and the two have long been considered pendants, although their measurements are not identical. The paintings were not among the works in the Dissius sale of 1696, a collection apparently originally owned by the artist's supposed patron, Pieter van Ruijven, and the earliest record of the painting is from 1713. Up until the late 18th century, they were referred to as \\"Astrologers\\". The pair were sold by an anonymous owner together in Rotterdam on April 27, 1713 (No. 10 or 11), for 300 florins (a \\"considerable sum\\", according to Wheelock). Hendrik Sorgh, an art broker, may have bought the paintings at that point. They were among his effects when he died in 1720, and both were sold on March 28 of that year in Amsterdam (No. 3 or 4 in the sale; for 160 florins; described as \\"An Astrologer\\" and \\"a repeat\\"). Govert Looten, a neighbor of Sorgh at the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam bought the paintings, which were sold from his estate on March 31, 1729 (this painting was No. 6 and went for 104 florins, both were described in the catalog as \\"sublimely and artfully painted\\"). Jacob Crammer Simmonsz of Amsterdam (1725-1778) owned the pair before 1778, hanging them in his home on the Prinsengracht (Simonsz also owned The Lacemaker and another Vermeer, now unknown, depicting a lady pouring wine). He sold The Astronomer and The Geographer together on November 25 of that year to a Huguenot banker, Jean Eti√®nne Fizeaux of Amsterdam, who owned The Geographer until his death in 1780. His widow owned the work until perhaps 1785. As of 1794 it was owned by Jan Danser Nijman of Amsterdam, who sold it on August 16, 1797 to Christiaan Josi, a publisher of prints, for 133 guilders. It later was bought by Arnoud de Lange of Amsterdam. This transaction separated the two paintings. De Lange sold it on December 12, 1803 for 360 florins. Sometime before 1821, the painting was owned by Johann Goll van Franckenstein Jr. of Velzen and Amsterdam. Pieter Hendrick Goll van Franckenstein of Amsterdam owned it before 1832, and he sold it on July 1, 1833 for 195 florins to a Nieuwenhuys. It was owned by Alexandre Dumont of Cambrai before 1860, who sold it through Thor√©- B≈©rger to Isaac Pereire of Paris, who owned it by 1866. It was sold on March 6, 1872. Max Kann of Paris owned the painting, perhaps that year, and it passed into the hands of Prince Demidoff of San Donato, near Florence, sometime before 1877, and stayed in his hands until he sold it on March 15, 1880. A.J. Bosch sold the painting in Vienna on April 28, 1885 (for √ïs 8,000) to a Kohlbacher, who sold it to the St√£delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt. The work was exhibited in the Exposition r√©trospective, Tableaux anciens emprunt√©s aux galeries particuli√®res held at the Palais des Champs-Elys√©es, Paris, 1866 ; at the exhibition of Ouvrages de peinture expos√©s au profit de la colonisation de l'Alg√©rie par les Alsaciens-Lorrains, Palais de la Pr√©sidence du Corps l√©gislatif, Paris, 1874 ; and in the Vermeer, oorsprong en involved.

Plot Tired of killing, war veteran Jefferson Waring rides west, but in Missouri he sees \\"squatters\\" mowed down by men working for rich, ruthless Artemus Taylor. He spends the night at Independence newspaperman Peter Sharpe's place, but is jailed when daughter Cathy Sharpe finds this total stranger in her room. The local marshal, John Harding, is just one of many men on Taylor's payroll. Peter's business is threatened by banker Stone unless he takes Taylor's side against \\"squatters\\" settling in the region. The blind and wheelchair-bound Taylor and ambitious daughter Norah are secretly aware that railroad surveyors are considering laying tracks nearby, so they want all the land for themselves. Jeff decides to leave. Norah and henchman Ding Bell intercept him; Norah shoots at him but misses. They take him to see Artemus, who tells a vocally reluctant Bell to take Jeff off to a remote canyon and murder him. Under Norah's instructions, Artemus's chief thug Sam Tobin goes after them to murder both; he wounds Jeff and kills Bell, but not before Bell hits him with a fatal shot. A doctor treats Jeff's wounds but Marshall Harding turns up and charges Jeff with the two killings. When the situation escalates and two of Taylor's thugs gun down Peter Sharpe, Jeff breaks out of jail and organizes a group of settlers to resist Taylor's planned big attack. The settlers slaughter Taylor's thugs; Taylor dies of a heart attack; Norah, having shot and she thinks killed banker Justin Stone in order to get some getaway money, is killed by him as she leaves.

History The exact origin and nature of the Vardariotai is uncertain. The name first appears in the tenth century, when a bishopric of the \\"Vardariotai or Tourkoi\\" is mentioned as subject to the diocese of Thessalonica.. The mid-fourteenth century writer Pseudo-Kodinos calls them \\"Persians\\" by race (a typical Byzantine anachronism for \\"Turks\\"), and recalls that they were settled in the Vardar river valley by an unnamed Byzantine emperor of old. In both cases, however, \\"Turks\\" probably implies the Magyars, who were called \\"Tourkoi\\" by the Byzantines in the tenth‚Äìeleventh centuries. Hence it seems that the Vardariotai were Magyars resettled in Macedonia in the tenth century, and that they had become Christians by the end of that century.. By the twelfth century, the Vardariotai, their Magyar identity by now much diluted, were being recruited into the Byzantine army, and, at the latest during the latter part of the reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180), they were formed into a distinct palace guard regiment... Their functions, however, at least in the Palaiologan period, appear to have been more those of a police force than a military unit: Pseudo- Kodinos lists them not with the guards, but with the unarmed palace personnel, and states that their duty was \\"to keep people orderly\\" during ceremonies. Unlike the armed members of the Varangian Guard and the Paramonai regiment, they were equipped only with a whip (the manglabion) and a staff (the dekanikion).. Kodinos also records that they wore distinctive red uniforms and a \\"Persian\\" hat called angouroton (\\"cucumber-shaped\\"), and that the whip, hanging at their belt, was their symbol. This latter reference has led to the hypothesis that the Vardariotai were the replacement of the older Manglabites guards corps. They were commanded by a primikerios, first attested in the year 1166.. The thirteenth-century historian George Akropolites further states that the Vardariotai accompanied the Byzantine emperor to his military camp whilst on campaign.. It is unclear whether and how the vardarioi, administrative officials of Thessalonica in the tenth‚Äìeleventh centuries, known through their seals, are related to the Vardariotai.

It was originally developed by the Edison2 team for the Automotive X Prize competition. Two such 4-passenger cars were the only qualifiers in the finals of the \\"mainstream\\" division of the competition, and one of them won the 2010 division prize of $5 million with a competition fuel economy of 102.5 MPGe. The design emphasizes mainstream rather than exotic materials, extreme low weight (less than 450 kg (1000 lbs)) and very low aerodynamic drag (coefficient of drag <0.16). Significant design innovations include in-wheel suspension and safety design derived from endurance auto racing.  Edison2 team  Edison2 was founded by Oliver Kuttner, a Virginia entrepreneur and auto enthusiast, and is headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The VLC development involved over 100 of its own and other companies' employees. After the contest, the team brought on designer Jason Hill and electric vehicle expert Ron Cervan.  X-Prize competition vehicles  Their four competition vehicles were powered by small (250cc) one-cylinder E85-gasohol-fueled internal combustion engines. The aim was to achieve the prize's requirement of 100 MPGe or higher fuel economy. A small E85 internal combustion engine was chosen for the competition in order to have the lowest possible powerplant and fuel weight, high energy density, low pumping losses, and an engine design with an efficiency sweet spot at cruising speed; while meeting mileage and emission standards. The fuel-vs-batteries tradeoff was especially onerous in the mainstream class, because it had a higher 200-mile range requirement, doubling the potential size of a heavy battery pack for hybrid and EV designs. Their two 4-passenger cars were the only qualifiers in the finals of the \\"mainstream\\" division of the competition. All other mainstream entrants broke down in qualifying rounds or failed to achieve minimum MPGe requirements. One of them won the 2010 division prize of $5 million with a fuel economy of 102.5 MPGe. Edison2 could not participate in final validation tests at Argonne Laboratories because two engines were damaged during the coast-down portion of final tests before validation. \\"Competition officials ruled that Edison2 was not at fault for the incidents at Coast Down that damaged the engines of both of their Mainstream Class entries.\\" In the absence of time and finances to repair and calibrate engines, \\"officials granted Edison2 a waiver from validation testing. However, Roush laboratories, a separate third party, had conducted dynamometer tests for Edison2 in preparation for Knockout and Finals rounds of the Xprize, and officials reversed an earlier decision to eliminate any vehicle unable to complete validation and agreed to review those results to determine whether they can be accepted in lieu of testing at Argonne.\\" After Coast Down and before tests at Argonne Labs, Xprize officials determined: \\"The engine failures were found to have been caused by third-party drivers of the vehicles, however, and were not blamed on vehicle design or capabilities.\\" Edison2 was permitted to provide independent third-party validation reports instead of undergoing the same validation testing as other finalist teams. Progressive Automotive Xprize posted Edison2's final MPGe results in a press release on their website. In addition to its entries in the X Prize \\"mainstream\\" division, the team also entered one additional vehicle in each of the two \\"alternative\\" (2-passenger) divisions. The side by side alternative class entrant, #96, \\"failed to meet the minimum 67 MPGe fuel- economy requirement\\" during the knockout phase of the X Prize competition and was eliminated.\\"Edison2 Very Light Car\\", Consumer Reports. Retrieved on 30 April 2013. The tandem alternative class entry suffered catastrophic engine failure, possibly due to a software problem, and was also eliminated.\\"A $2.5 million software problem: Catastrophic failure eliminates local supercar from competition\\", \\"The Daily Progress\\", 27 July 2010. Retrieved 30 April 2013  Current work  After winning the X-Prize, Edison2 continues work on further VLC prototypes, developing more aerodynamic bodies, an electric drive train, and further refining the innovative in-wheel suspension. In addition, further prototypes are aimed more at consumer acceptance than bare-bones competition requirements. The eventual aim is to have established auto manufacturers pick up low-weight designs for mass production, and possibly license individual technologies, such as the in-wheel suspension.

The Annual Dinner takes place each year in the spring and attracts a high-level dais of dignitaries and a diverse audience of 700 executives and professionals from global corporations, professional firms, and leading nonprofits.  FWA of New York Educational Fund2013 Annual Dinner & 29th Women of the Year Award Journal  The FWA of New York Educational (Ed) Fund has been the educational arm of the FWA of New York Inc. Through the Ed Fund, FWA members engage in scholarship, mentoring, and learning activities in accordance with the FWA's philosophy of investing in the next generation and the wider business community. Founded as an unincorporated association in 1976, the FWA of New York Educational Fund was granted tax-exempt status as a 501(c)3 charitable organization and incorporated in 1982.  Programs   High School Mentoring Program  The FWA's mentoring activities began at Murry Bergtraum in 1985-86. The FWA matches FWA mentors to students each year, until graduation. The program currently mentors 30 students each year. They participate in SAT and PSAT classes, financial aid workshops, book clubs, career discussion groups and overnight college visits. Students also volunteer at soup kitchens. In 2013, 100% of the mentees graduated high school and enrolled in college. As of 2014, the program is supported by two of underwriters: the Mah Jongg Foundation and U.S. Bankcorp.  Baruch College Mentoring  The FWA's mentoring activities launched at Baruch College in 2002. It evolved into a one-on-one mentoring program where mentors and mentees are paired and encouraged to meet and keep in contact. Currently, the program matches mentors with 30 undergraduate business students. The program offers various events throughout the school years including panel discussions, breakfast with FWA corporate sponsors, professional/business etiquette, holiday and fun events, and cocktail parties, etc. The program helps students explore career paths, gain networking experience and discover internship opportunities. The one-on-one mentoring model achieved recognition as a model program from Harvard University, and it continued to be expanded to online mentoring through the development of a web-based career development community.  Scholarships for High School Mentoring Graduates  Since 1988, the FWA of New York Educational Fund has awarded over $600,000 to over 175 qualifying graduating Murry Bergtraum High School mentees. BMO Capital Markets has generously provided funds for these scholarships since 2009.  FWA/BMO Capital Markets Scholars Fund at Baruch  The FWA endowed full scholarships for students in the FWA-Baruch College mentoring program. Special thanks to BMO Capital Markets, twenty-three young women have received support through this funding since 2005. Through its Equity Through Education \\"Day of Trading\\" Program, BMO Capital Markets has contributed over $1.6 million to the FWA of New York Educational Fund over the past eight years. Over 40 Baruch College students and 19 Murry Bergtraum High School students have received FWA/BMO Capital Market Scholarships in 2012-13.  MBA Scholarships  The program started in 1983. FWA Graduate Scholarships totaling $750,000 have assisted nearly 150 students in completing business degrees at the graduate level. The scholarships support graduate business education for women at four NYC-metro schools: MBA candidates at Baruch, Columbia, Fordham, and Stern (NYU); and an MIA candidate specializing in Microfinance at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA).  Wall Street Exchange  The Wall Street Exchange program typically provides an eight-week summer internship opportunity to enhance soft skillsand job search techniques. It helps the participants to better prepare themselves for the workforce through designated events and programs. Since the 1970s, FWA corporate partners have hosted the workshops and have even hired some of the 1,000-plus WSE participants.  Financial Backpack  Since 2001, FWA members began offering financial lieracy workshops to high school students through the FWA Financial Backpack program. Twice a year, in the fall and spring, a two- session workshop is held on the weekends, in conjunction with the NYC Department of Education's Job Readiness Program for Virtual Enterprise students. Smaller events are also held throughout the year with other education groups. For years ago, HSBC in the Community (USA) granted $900,000 to the FWA to expand the program over five years and offer it to more than 400 students annually. As of April 2013, nearly 3,000 students have come through the program.  Adult Financial Literacy  FWA members began teaching financial literacy to adult clients at University Settlement in lower Manhattan. Now the FWA Financial Literacy program is offering seven week classes at Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) and the Grace Institute. Over 230 people have completed the program since its inception in 2003.  Educational Programs for the General Business Community  Educational programs conducted by the multiple committees are available to all members and guests of the FWA. These include: Professional Development, Not-for-Profit, Entrepreneurs, and Impact Investing.  New FWA/BMO Scholars Program  The FWA/BMO scholars are offered new programs to broader their experience. Two young women from Baruch studied in China, including 2013 annual dinner featured student speaker Fang Fang Nan. 10 Students from Baruch were sent to Conferences at Simmons College in Boston and The National Conference for College Women Student Leaders at University of Maryland at College Park. 4 to 6 students at Baruch College were offered Tools for Clear Speech Program, which involves a variety of resources designated to provide clear speech and intelligibility instructions for non-native English speakers. In addition, the FWA Scholar's Community Online was established to engage all past and current students and mentors allowing them to stay connected.

The name is a play on the host's last name (John Urban). It premiered on July 3, 2000 and recorded its last show on December 6, 2012. It saw two distinct production concepts and has done a limited number of shows taped live on location. History In 2000, a replacement show was needed for a Thursday timeslot on \\"TVW\\" in Madison, WI. John Urban, known for co-hosting a morning radio show on a local rock station accepted the invitation to host the show from the station's sales manager, Ralph Cohen. Production ended in December 2012.http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=37893 Live-on-air format Initially, the show was part of the station's live \\"6:30 Show\\" concept. Each week day, TVW would air a live, interview show with viewer call ins at the start of \\"local prime time\\" (6:30pm, central time). \\"The 6:30 Show with John Urban\\" filled that Thursday slot. While guests included local media personalities, actors, comedians and musicians, performances during this incarnation were rare, as the logistics of staging a live performance live on the air were difficult for the production venue to overcome. Artists who performed did their songs in an acoustic guitar with vocal staging arrangement. In 2001, the WB Network (TVW's network affiliation) wanted programming with broader appeal to lead-in to the start of their national prime time, causing the replacement of the locally produced \\"6:30 Shows\\" by nationally produced syndicated programming. Live-to-recording format With the end of the show airing live, the producers were able to re-shape the show's production concept to fit within the limitations which had made it tantamount to impossible to do full group (band) performances. The revised logistics included: * Bands are required to book an engineer to create the stereo (Left and Right) mix * Bands are required to bring their own audio equipment (microphones, mic stands, cables/snakes, audio mixing console, effects rack, etc., usually supplied by the audio engineer) * Production is held over two days, usually Wednesday and Thursday. ** Wednesday: equipment load in and rehearsal ** Thursday: recording * Show is recorded out of order ** All performance segments first ** Interview segment is taped last, which would then be timed to fill out the remainder of the 22:26 of content ** When the show airs, the interview segment airs as the second segment *** Segment 1: Music *** Segment 2: Interview *** Segment 3: Music *** Segment 4: Music The show is produced live-to-recording in studio, with no audience nor post production editing. To date there have been four shows recorded on location. Location productions add the \\"energy\\" and visual element of a live audience, but add logistical problems (field production equipment, location availability, editing time) which raise production costs and therefore limit these opportunities. The bands/artists are not paid to be on the show; the opposite is generally true, as bands usually incur the cost of providing the audio engineer. Performers can justify this because of the exposure gained by performing on the television station as well as the re-distribution of the video and audio of the performances on the band's personal web sites offset this cost. Bands are invited on the show after submitting a media kit to the producers for review. Not all shows are musical performances, such as shows featuring: *\\"The Prom Committee\\" a Madison-based improv comedy group, which performed three of their sketches *The Wisconsin Film Festival, with clips from some of the featured the films. Past shows are re-run during the week, with the \\"first run\\" on the weekend of the show which is recorded that week.

Arms are similar to those used by the House of Mendoza who dominated the Cantabria region after their merger with the \\"House of Lasso de la Vega\\", well known since the beginnings of the 14th century, mother of the 1st marquess of Santillana I√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza y de la Vega, (1398 - 1458), grandfather of the 1st marquess of Cenete, Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar y Mendoza. Castle of La Calahorra The Marquisate of Cenete (alternatively, of Zenete, El Cenete, or El Zenete; ) is a noble title first granted in 1491 by Queen Isabel I of CastileDate of concession of marquisate: T√≠tulos Nobiliarios espa√±oles y extranjeros autorizados en Espa√±a , Registro Internacional de Armas Gentilicias (riag.es). to Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar y Mendoza, First Count del Cid.Concesi√≥n del marquesado y genealog√≠a de los marqueses del Cenete. The name refers to the Andalusian comarca of Zenete in the province of Granada. Zenete or Cenete may derive from the Arabic sened, meaning the slope that constitutes one side of a mountain range, referring to the north side of the Sierra Nevada. Another possibility is that the name refers to the Zenata Berber tribes, which were highly respected in medeaval Spain for their horsemanship. Jinete, the Spanish word for horseman, is derived from this people. The Marquisate was promoted to grandeeship 15 May 1909. The current marquess is Menc√≠a L√≥pez-Becerra de Sol√© y de Casanova. Castillo de la Calahorra, at some 50 km from Granada The castle of La Calahorra, at some 50km. from Granada on the roads towards Guadix and Almeria, was designed by Italian architects at the beginnings of the 1500s One of the young children besides the senior, a sixth child, of famous literary man I√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, (1398‚Äì1458), was the Bishop of Calahorra and of Sig√ºenza since 1473 and later Cardinal of Toledo, the highest ecclesiastical distinction in Spain from a Pope, came to be known as Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza, (1428‚Äì1495), a.k.a. Cardinal and statesman Cardenal Mendoza. While being a Roman Catholic bishop at Calahorra and therefore supposed not to have a sexiual life leading to descendency, he became attached to Do√±a Mencia de Lemus, a Portuguese lady-in-waiting of the queen. She bore him two sons, Rodrigo, who was once selected in a list of candidates to be the husband of Lucrezia Borgia, one of the children fathered in Rome by the later Spanish Roman Catholic Pope Alexander VI, and Diego, who was the grandfather of the princess of Eboli of the reign of Philip II (see Antonio Perez) By In√©s de Tovar, a lady of a Valladolid family, he had a third son (Juan Hurtado de Mendoza y Tovar) who afterwards emigrated to France. On the death of King Henry IV of Castile, (1425‚Äì1473), on 11 December 1473, the Mendoza family from Guadalajara, who had remained faithful to king Henry, was sought after and much courted by the new 23 years old self-proclaimed Queen of Castile, Isabel I of Castile, (1451‚Äì1504), a half sister of king Henry, against the sectors of the nobility wising to remain faithfdul to the young daughter of the king, 12 years old Juana la Beltraneja, (1462‚Äì1530). Isabel I had married, disregarding the authority, the advice and the political balances thought out by her brother the king, Prince of Aragon, later King of Aragon since 1479, Ferdinand II of Aragon, (1452‚Äì1516). The self-proclamation of Isabel was made in Segovia the day after her half-brother died and without even counting at the time with her husband the Aragon Prince. Civil wars ensued in Castile, the accounts running into many hundreds of books and probably hundreds of thousands of pages since then. To cut short, the by then Archbishop of Seville, Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza, fourth child of poet I√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, was offered by Isabel of Castile to \\"create new nobility lineages\\" with his \\"beautiful children of sin\\", (the Queen \\"dixit\\"), Rodrigo, Diego and their half brother Juan. Rodrigo became Count del Cid, to remember a 400-year-old \\"ancestor\\", the famous El Cid from Medieval Castilian History. The first marquess of Cenete or Zenete, title of 1491, was also awarded by the Catholic Monarchs to Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar y Mendoza, deceased 1523. He built the Castle of La Calahorra, and married twice, first to Leonor de la Cerda y Arag√≥n, deceased around 1497, and later to Mar√≠a de Fonseca y Toledo . His daughter Menc√≠a de Mendoza, Second Marquise, died without issue; his other daughter Mar√≠a, became Third Marquise and married Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 4th Count of Salda√±a, heir to the Duchy of Infantado. Thus the marquisate passed to the House of Infantado, whose members used both titles, alternating each generation between the style \\"Marquess of Cenete and Duke of Infantado\\" and \\"Duke of Infantado and Marquess of Cenete\\".Marqu√©s del Cenete, Grandes de Espa√±a. Detailed genealogy of the marquesses of Cenete. Accessed online 2010-02-10.

Capable of being operated either on wheels or floats, it was successful enough for a further two similar aircraft to be built, with the type remaining in use until the early years of the First World War. Development and design In 1912, the Short S.36 tractor biplane, built for Francis McClean, was loaned to the Royal Navy for use at its Naval Flying School. Impressed by the S.36, the Admiralty ordered two similar tractor biplanes, capable of operating on either wheels or floats, the smaller Short S.45, like the S.36, powered by a 70 hp (52 kW) Gnome Lambda, and the larger Short S.41 powered by a 14-cylinder, twin-row 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome double Omega rotary engine.Barnes 1967, pp. 79‚Äì80. The S.41 was an unequal-span two bay tractor biplane with a slim rectangular section fuselage mounted between the wings. It was first flown by Charles Rumney Samson on 2 April 1912 with a wheeled undercarriage, and shortly afterwards was fitted with floats, consisting of two main pontoons under the fuselage and smaller floats at the wingtips and tail, and was delivered to the Navy.Barnes 1967, p.80. Following the operational flights made during 1912, S.41 was returned to the factory for an overhaul and the fitting of folding wings, which were hinged so that they folded back horizontally alongside the fuselage, reducing storage space required for stowage aboard ship. At this time it was given the RNAS number \\"10\\". In November 1913 it underwent further modifications, being used to perfect a development of the folding mechanism which allowed the wings to be unfolded from the cockpit: at the same time new wings, similar in pattern to those of the Short Admiralty Type 81 were fitted. The folding wing mechanism for shipborne aircraft had been designed by Horace Short, and was the subject of a series of patentsPatents secured by Short Brothers including patents nos. 1792/13, 15727/13 and 28610/13, 5290/14, 20537/14 and 9276/15, see Barnes and James, pp. 92, 110 Operational history The S.41 was flown successfully at the Fleet Review at Weymouth on 8 May, being based on the Battleship HMS Hibernia.Bruce Flight 14 December 1956, p. 923. It was also used by Samson to carry out survey flights of potential sites for seaplane stations, which led to the establishment of the seaplane station at Felixstowe,Barnes 1967, p.82. and for early trials with use of radio from aircraft. The success of the S.41 was such that two similar aircraft, constructor's numbers S.51 and S.52,Barnes 1989, pp. 529. also powered by the two-row Gnome, were ordered by the RNAS,Barnes 1967, p.83. with serial numbers 20 and 21: These were first flown in April 1913.Barnes 1967, pp. 88‚Äì89. These aircraft differed in detail from the first aircraft: the wing section was improved, double-acting ailerons were fitted and the overhanging section of the upper wing was braced by kingposts rather than struts. Like 10, they were used for trials of airborne radio, as well as carrying out tests of beaching gear. They remained in use at the start of the First World War, where, despite the unreliability of the twin-row Gnome,Barnes 1967, p. 97. they were used for anti-submarine patrols early in the war, 20 continuing in use from the seaplane station at Great Yarmouth until July 1915.Flight 14 December 1956, p. 924. Variants A single aircraft, similar in design to the S.41 but slightly smaller, was built by Shorts and exhibited at the 1913 Aero Show at Olympia, London, featuring a number of refinements including manganese-steel tube interplane struts and provision for starting the engine from the cockpit. This had the Shorts manufacturer's number S.53, and was later bought by the Admiralty and given RNAS No. 42, thereby becoming known as the Admiralty Type 42. It was first flown as a seaplane but later fitted with a wheeled undercarriage: in this form it was one of the aircraft which were sent to Ostend at the outbreak of World War I: it was written off by Samson on 28 September 1914 when it crashed on takeoff due to engine failure.Barnes 1967 Operators ; *Royal Naval Air Service  Specifications (S.41 seaplane)  See also Notes References *Barnes, C.H.

He was an important exponent of the works of Riccardo Zandonai, notably starring in the world premieres of his operas I cavalieri di Ekeb√π (1925) and Giuliano (1928). His voice is preserved on a number of recordings made with the HMV, Parlophone, and Path√© record labels. Music critic Alan Blyth described him as a \\"fiery, strong tenor\\" who \\"excelled in verismo parts.\\" Early life and education Born in Patern√≤, Lo Giudice was the older brother of tenor Silvio Costa Lo Giudice and a distant cousin of Portuguese soprano Maria Giudice. He studied singing with Beniamino Carelli at the Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella in Naples, Matteo Adern√≤ in Catania, and with Antonio Savastano, Luigi Lucenti, and Luigi Di Cagno in Milan. His studies were interrupted in 1914 when he was drafted into the Italian Army following the outbreak of World War I. His first public performances were given during the war, singing in concerts for Italian soldiers. He served in the military for the duration of the war, and then continued with further opera studies at its conclusion in 1918. Career Lo Giudice made his operatic debut in 1919 as Gastone in La traviata at the opera house in Livorno. In 1920 he sang Dick Johnson in Giacomo Puccini's La fanciulla del West at the opera house in Tortona. In 1922 he made his first appearance at the Teatro di San Carlo as Prince Vasiliy Ivanovich Shuysky in the Naples premiere of Boris Godunov with Sigismondo Zalewsky in the title role. That same year he had a major triumph at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome singing the title role in Umberto Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier. He made a number of appearances at the Anfiteatro Gangi in Catania in 1922-1923, including Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, Gastone, and Turiddu in Cavalleria rusticana. In 1924 he made his debut at the Teatro Regio in Turin as Romeo in Riccardo Zandonai's Giulietta e Romeo opposite Hina Spani as Giulietta. He returned to that house several times through 1935, singing such roles as Giannetto Malaspini in La cena delle beffe and Pollione in Norma among others. On 7 March 1925 Lo Giudice made his debut at La Scala as Giosta Berling in the world premiere of Zandonai's I cavalieri di Ekeb√π under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. Toscanini was quite taken with his performance and Lo Giudice was contracted by him frequently for performances at La Scala through the mid-1930s. In 1926 he alternated in the role of Prince Cal√†f with tenor Miguel Fleta in the original production of Puccini's Turandot, although Fleta had the honor of singing the part for the opera's opening night. Other roles he portrayed at La Scala included Avito in L'amore dei tre re, Dick Johnson, Giannetto Malaspini, and Giuseppe Hagenbach in La Wally among others. Lo Giudice made his first appearance at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna on 21 November 1925 as Giannetto Malaspini to Carmen Melis's Ginerva and Salvatore Baccaloni's Tornaquinci. He returned to that house in 1927 to portray Mateo in Zandonai's Conchita and again in 1928 to sing Dick Johnson to Iva Pacetti's Minnie. In 1926 he made his debut at the Arena di Verona Festival and in 1927 he sang Prince Cal√†f to Elena Barrigar's Turandot for his first appearance at the Teatro Regio in Parma. He returned to Parma in 1930 to sing Cal√†f to Patrizia Toldi's Turandot and again in 1938 to portray Eugenio Beauharnais in Italo Brancucci's Fiorella. Lo Giudice returned to the Teatro di San Carlo in 1927 to sing the title role in Arrigo Boito's Nerone with Elena Barrigar as Asteria. He sang again at that house on 4 February 1928 when he portrayed the title role in the world premiere of Zandonai's Giuliano. The following 14 March he made his first appearance at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma singing the title role in the world premiere of Giuseppe Mul√®'s Dafni. He sang several roles at the Rome opera house through 1930, including Giuliano and Cal√†f. He also made his first appearance at the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo in 1928 as Des Grieux in Puccini's Manon Lescaut. On the international stage, Lo Giudice performed in opera houses in Hungary, Brazil, and Chile during the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1925 he performed at the Royal Opera, London as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly. He remained active in Italian opera houses up into the mid-1940s. One of his last performances was a portrayal of Andrea Ch√©nier at the Teatro Verdi in Florence in 1944 with Iris Ferriani as Maddalena. After retiring from the stage he taught singing at the Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini in Catania. He died in Catania at the age of 97.

She was one of the first women in the United States to make a living from conducting, and did so at more than 6,000 performances during her lifetime. Her career spanned nearly five decades, from the 1870s, when she first began conducting for touring comic opera companies, until her death in 1929. In the early 1900s, she took a decade-long hiatus from her musical career to move to Alaska, where she was a prospector and traveler. Steiner wrote hundreds of musical pieces, including seven operas. Biography Steiner was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1856. Her father, Colonel Frederick Steiner, was a Mexican War hero and her mother an accomplished pianist. Thus, she was exposed to music at a young age, composing songs by age 7 and a piano duet at 9. Others recognized her talents early, and even suggested to her father that he send her to Paris to study music, but her parents refused and did not encourage her to develop the talent. She nonetheless continued composing, starting on an opera at age 11, Aminaide, one scene of which was produced at the Peabody Conservatory, a prominent music school in Baltimore that Steiner was not able to attend. Music historians are unsure exactly how or when, but by the age of 21, Steiner had left her family behind to pursue her musical career. She moved to Chicago, where she became assistant music director at a small opera company. In the following years, she worked as a conductor for a series of touring light opera companies that performed Gilbert and Sullivan and other comic operas that were popular during that period. In 1889 and again in 1891, her opera Fleurette was produced to good reviews. Steiner rose to further prominence when one of her compositions was performed at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exhibition. The next year, she conducted a performance of her own works in New York City by the well- respected Anton Seidl Orchestra. Nome, Alaska in 1900, a few years before Steiner arrived, was little more than a tent city Despite a bout of pneumonia in 1896, Steiner continued to conduct, compose, and perform. Soon after the turn of the century, however, she experienced a series of tragedies. A 1902 warehouse fire in New York destroyed many of her works, including the only remaining copy of her first opera. She experienced another, more severe illness that affected her eyesight. And in 1909, she filed a lawsuit after the death of her father, who had remarried after her mother's death and had written Steiner out of his will in preference to his stepdaughter. Around this time, Steiner left her career behind, and moved to Nome, Alaska. There, she became traveler and a prospector in the tin mining fields northwest of Nome, where she was the first white woman to enter, and where she discovered important tin deposits. Following her return after nearly a decade, she became an advocate for Alaska, often giving talks about the state. She again turned to music, and continued writing and performing into the 1920s. The Metropolitan Opera held a special performance of her works in 1925, the last time a woman would conduct there until 1976. She also helped found a home for elderly and infirm musicians, to which she dedicated the proceeds of some of her later concerts. In its obituary after her death on February 27, 1929, The New York Times claimed that the stress of running the home had brought on the collapse that ended her life. During her career, Steiner conducted more than 6,000 performances of operas, operettas, and other works including a number of her own. She wrote hundreds of musical pieces, including seven operas. In addition to her original works she is credited along with Caroline B. Nichols as being among the first women in the United States to make a successful career out of conducting musical performances.

It was created by Pat Hutchins, also the creator of the Titch book series. Production According to Pat Hutchins, each episode took three weeks to shoot as it was created in stop-motion animation, using clay models instead of proposed cartoons. The models were miniatures, as ITV gave the animating team a limited budget so that production or scale was minimalistic. After the first two series finished airing in 1999, a third series went into production, and premiered during 2000, before it had its final episode in mid-2001. There is no disclosed reason why the programme was cancelled, but repeats of the programme aired occasionally until around 2003. The series was then repeated on Tiny Living before moving to Milkshake! on channel 5 between 2005-2006. Music and DVD The music for Titch was composed by British pianist & composer Michael Nyman.

Life Thomas was the third son of Thomas Wood (1565‚Äì1649) and Susanna Cranmer (1570‚Äì1650). He was baptised on 22 July 1607 in the Church of St. John's in then fashionable Hackney, where his grandfather Henry had bought land and built a country house at Clapton on the edge of Hackney Downs. Edmond Chester Waters writes in 1877: He was educated at Westminster School amongst the King's Scholars, and was elected in 1627 to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, where he proceeded B.A. on 27 April 1631, and M.A. on 24 April 1634. He had in the meantime taken Holy Orders, and was, by the influence of his family at Court, appointed at the age of 28 a chaplain in ordinary to the King, who presented him in the same year, on 2 July 1635, to the Rectory of Whickham in the county of Durham. He proceeded B.D. on 15 May 1641, and was created D.D. by dispensation on 13 March in the next year. About the same time he obtained from Charles I a royal mandate to the Bishop of Durham to present him on the next vacancy to a prebendal stall in his cathedral, but before this appointment was completed, his course of preferment was interrupted by the Civil War, and he was ejected from his living by the Parliament. He employed this period of compulsory leisure in travelling abroad, and spent some years in Italy. He made a long stay at Rome, where he was confirmed in that strong dislike of Popery and High Church observance which distinguished him through life. After his return to England he lived in retirement on his patrimony at Hackney until the Restoration, when he was restored to the Rectory of Whickham by the House of Commons. At the same time he was reinstated as one of the chaplains in ordinary at Court, and on 15 June 1660 he made petition to the King to give effect to the mandate of Charles I. by bestowing upon him the Prebend at Durham, which had been vacant since the death of the Bishop of Exeter on 7 December 1659. His suit was supported by the powerful influence of his brother Sir Henry Wood, and he was presented on 7 July 1660 to the 11th stall in Durham Cathedral. He was duly installed on 10 December. following, and held this preferment in commendam until his death. In February 1663-4 he was promoted to the Deanery of Lichfield, when Dr. Paul was made Bishop of Oxford. The Dean married, about Michaelmas 1666, Grace Clavering, the youngest sister of Sir James Clavering Bart. of Axwell Park, who was his parishioner at Whickham. The disagreements arising from their disparity of 29 years were maliciously dwelt upon by his brother Canons. The Tanner Mss. in the Bodleian contain a mass of correspondence relating to Dr. Wood, and it is difficult to decide whether he was more detested at Lichfield or Durham. His puritanical principles made him hateful to the Bishops of both dioceses, who were High Churchmen, and were zealously engaged in restoring the fabric and ornaments of their cathedrals, whilst his personal meanness and avarice were a bye-word with his brother Prebendaries. And there is no doubt that the Dean was a constant invalid, although he lived to a great age. It is not surprising that the Dean's wife was of one mind with her husband in his puritanical opinions and his partiality to the Nonconformists, for all her family associations were connected with the extreme Protestant party at Newcastle upon Tyne. He was now living in open warfare with the residing Canons of Lichfield, who served him on 19 February 1667‚Äì8 with formal articles of complaint. The success with which the Dean set at defiance all complaints of his conduct, and his brother's position at Court, caused then a general expectation at Durham and Lichfield that he would be promoted to the next vacant bishopric. And that was realised in the following year, for when Sir Henry Wood concluded with Lord Treasurer Clifford the treaty for the marriage of his only surviving child Mary to the King's eldest son by the Duchess of Cleveland, it was part of the bargain that the vacant bishopric of Lichfield should be given to his brother. Accordingly, the Dean was elected Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry on 9 June 1671, and was consecrated at Lambeth on 2 July by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the same time and place, Dr. Nathaniel Crew (afterwards Lord Crew and Bishop of Durham) was consecrated Bishop of Oxford. He was a prelate of the same type as Bishop Wood, and resembled him in many circumstances of his career. They were both cadets of influential families, and owed their advancement to family interest at Court without any pretension to professional merit. Both eventually succeeded to great estates of inheritance, and died without issue. Each of these Bishops was regarded by the Clergy of his time as a scandal to his order and the Church, but is remembered for munificence and for charitable foundations which are still in existence. Bishop Wood was a great benefactor to Christ Church, Oxford, for he contributed liberally in his lifetime to the rebuilding of the large quadrangle and by his Will he left in trust for students lands of above 200 l. a year, and 3000 l. in money. His arms are graven on the gateway at Christ Church, and his portrait by Lely hangs in the College Hall. He also built two hospitals for the aged poor, one at Clapton, and the other at Ufford. And his Will contained charitable bequests to the poor of Durham, Chester, Whickham, and Hackney. His family In his last years Bishop Wood defended his kinsman Anthony Wood against an attack by Bishop Gilbert Burnet. The Wood family came from Lancashire and the name Wood is common amongst the yeomanry. Anthony told us in his diaries that the family arrived in Oxfordshire in the household of the 6th Earl of Derby. The precise relationship between both branches of the family is not yet established, but it is known that the Bishop's grandfather Henry served in the household of Elizabeth I. At a very early age his father served there too, was Clerk of the Queen's Pastry in 1601 and was promoted Sergeant in the next reign. After the Restoration the Bishop's generation became people of consequence. The eldest brother of Bishop Wood, Sir Henry Wood 1st Bt. (1597‚Äì1671) became a great landowner, who was not tempted by the bargains of the time, because his purchases were confined to voluntary sales by private owners. They include the manor and advowson of Whepsted, the manor and priory of Campsey, and the manors of Ufford, Syleham, Staverton, Eyke, Blyford, Hollesley-cum-Sutton, Dunningsworth, Elmeswell, Woolpit, and Drinkeston, all in Suffolk. He chose as his seat Loudham Park in the parish of Ufford, Suffulk. As Treasurer in the Royal Household he did not desert Queen Henrietta Maria (1609‚Äì1669) when fortunes were at their lowest ebb or because his salary had long been unpaid; he even advanced out money of his own resources for payment. His long and faithful services to the Royal Family - and that of his wife Mary Gardiner (1627‚Äì1665) and his daughter Mary (1664‚Äì1680), were not forgotten. The settlement for his daughter's marriage was beneficial to both parties, and was executed on 23d May 1671. The next day Sir Henry made his Will and the day after that he died. When Mary was 16 she was to be at full liberty to break off altogether the marriage provided for her, but in that case she was to forfeit 20,000 l. to the young Earl of Southampton (1662‚Äì1730) out of the savings of her minority. That same year the provision was set aside by the then all-powerful Duchess of Cleveland, the Earl's mother, and the marriage was celebrated, notwithstanding their ages, only 9 and 7. Mary died ten years later of smallpox, when she was scarcely 17, and was - like her mother - buried in Westminster Abbey. A similar settlement was attempted between another natural child of the King and Charles Wood alias Cranmer (1665‚Äì1743), grandson of Lady Chester who was the Bishop's sister and who as trustee protested to no result the manoeuvrings of the Duchess in the House of Lords. In that dispute her co-trustee, the then Dean of Lichfield, stood passive. The new settlement needed the Bishop's commitment, but again he refused to decide; so, it fell apart. The family fortune was indeed Charles's inheritance after the death of his father, Sir Caesar Wood alias Cranmer Kt. (1634‚Äì1707), and he passed it on to another Lady Chester, Bertha Webb (1683‚Äì1743), the granddaughter of the Bishop's youngest sister Elizabeth. The bishop's brother and second son John Wood (1599‚Äì1651) was a brewer at Hackney. He had issue five children; his only son died in 1668 at the age of 33. Only his eldest daughter Mary, Mrs. Kirke, survived when his wife died in 1675. The bishop's sister, Mary Wood (1604‚Äì1684), eldest daughter first married at St. Margaret's Westminster on 4 July 1633 widower Samuel Cranmer (1575‚Äì1640), proprietor of the Swan Brewery, who was Alderman of Cripplegate Ward when he served as one of the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex. He brought to the marriage the manorial estate of Upper Itchington in Warwickshire and the mansion and manor of Astwoodbury in Buckinghamshire, the seat of the family. To his only sister Anne and her husband Lewis Cawdry he left his father's leasehold estate at Alcester, where he was born. His son Caesar was 6 years old, when he died; the management of his estates was entrusted to his uncle Sir Henry. His mother married 6 years later Sir Henry Chester K.B. (1597‚Äì1669). Caesar's education involved travelling abroad, and he made a long stay at Paris, where Sir Henry resided. He was graciously received by the exiled Queen and was high in her favour when he married some years later one of the ladies of her Court, Lelis de la Garde (1642‚Äì1726); a position she held until her death. Dame Lelis continued to reside at Somerset House with her only surviving daughter Anne (1668‚Äì1723) until the reign of the Stuart's ended, when she purchased the lease of Lady Dover's house in the parish of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, where she died. Caesar brought his wife to England in 1660 in the train of the Royal Family and was appointed one of the Equerries in the household of the Duchess of York; he was promoted to the rank of her Chief Equerry when Maria d‚ÄôEste, the new Duchess, became Queen. The Revolution of 1688 deprived Sir Caesar of his place at Court, but earlier his prospects ‚Äì Loudham Park and 4300 l. a year - had been improved by the death of his cousin Mary, the Duchess of Southampton, when he became entitled in reversion to the great estate of Sir Henry Wood, subject to the life-interest of his uncle the Bishop. In compliance with Sir Henry's Will he had assumed the name of Wood. But within the next few months he encountered a more serious reverse of fortune; for in 1689 the Duke of Southampton was advised to claim a life- interest in the estates of his deceased wife and filed a bill in Chancery to enforce his rights. The Lords Commissioners made in 1692 a decree in favour of the Duke. Sir Caesar appealed to the House of Lords and in the same year they pronounced final judgment; declaring that the Duke's interest had determined on his wife's death, and that in the actual state of facts (which had not been provided for by Sir Henry Wood) the right of Sir Caesar under the Will did not accrue until the Duke's death, and in the meantime the rents and profits belonged to Sir Henry's heirs-at-law (then only the sons of Sir Henry's two sisters, Lady Chester and Mrs. Webb, were alive).

She inherited her name from her predecessor. She was launched in April 2008 and commissioned in May 2009 with the hull number AGB-5003. She began her first voyage on 10 November 2009.  Naming  In Japanese, the name \\"Shirase\\" is written in hiragana. Due to a JMSDF internal naming rule, an icebreaker must take its name from a place. Accordingly, Shirase is said to take its name from Shirase Glacier. This glacier bears the family name of Lieutenant Nobu Shirase, a Japanese pioneer in Antarctic exploration.  Operations  In February 2013, anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society claimed Shirase was sent to monitor its interference with the Japanese cetacean research fleet. However, according to the National Institute of Polar Research, the icebreaker was in fact far to the west off the coast of Antarctica near the Showa Base, at the time. The Japanese Government subsequently confirmed that the vessel was not involved in any operation related to the whaling program, and that Sea Shepherd's claims were \\"completely fake\\". On 17 February 2014, Shirase ran aground just off the unmanned Molodyozhnaya Station in Antarctica.

The six-part series stars William Ash, David Warner, Ian Puleston-Davies, Reece Dinsdale, Nicholas Gleaves, Laura Fraser, Jason Watkins and Zoe Henry. The series was created and was written by Bill Gallagher (previously known for Clocking Off and Out of the Blue), produced by Red Production Company, and directed by Marc Munden (Vanity Fair, Canterbury Tales: The Knight's Tale). The producer was Ann Harrison-Baxter (The Second Coming, The Cops), with Nicola Shindler and Gareth Neame as executive producers for Red Production Company and the BBC respectively. The storyline was later used as the basis for the movie Blood, starring Paul Bettany, Mark Strong and Brian Cox. Premise The series is centred on the Fairburn family, all of whom live in an edgy Lancashire town with a growing tendency towards vigilante justice. All three of the Fairburn siblings are involved with law enforcement: brothers Chrissie (William Ash) and Ray (Nicholas Gleaves) are police officers, while their sister Beth (Zoe Henry) works as a lawyer. Beth, Chrissie and Ray's widowed father Lenny (David Warner) is a retired police officer who berates the political correctness of his children's modern methods: he himself is fighting a losing battle with Alzheimer's disease and struggling to come to terms with the fact that he can no longer be the strong and authoritative head of the family. Ray and Chrissie work as officers in a five-person Criminal Investigation Department team. The other members are the solitary but insightful Robert (Reece Dinsdale); Lucy (Laura Fraser), the newest recruit, with a need to prove herself; and the volatile family man Joe (Ian Puleston-Davies), an 'old school' officer with a barely contained temper and a tendency to both bully Chrissie and clash with the \\"by- the-book\\" Ray. The murder of a 12-year-old girl adds to existing tensions and pushes an already angry community towards action and revenge. In this atmosphere, the various policemen involved in the murder investigation begin to take increasingly dangerous steps towards concluding the investigation. The situation becomes even more complicated when Beth becomes the defence lawyer for the principal suspect, Jason Buliegh (Jason Watkins). As the distinction between right and wrong becomes fatally blurred, two of the officers take things a step too far. Background Conviction was described by the BBC as a drama which \\"explores the notion that everyone has the ability to kill and what it is that can trigger that reaction in any of us (using) the volatile and dangerous world of the CID as a backdrop to show how a group of very real characters are affected practically, mentally and emotionally by what they have to face on a daily basis. It's also about the resilience and humour of family and friends as they too deal with the psychological fallout.\\" The drama makes multiple uses of flashbacks and fast-forwards, interlinking time and obscuring the line between reality and fantasy. Executive producer Nicola Shindler recalled \\"Bill came up with a basic idea about an incident involving two policemen which severely affects their life both at work and at home and, from that, we developed the idea about a family who worked in the police station... I think that Conviction is more of a 'whydunnit' not 'whodunnit' because it looks at people's psyche. It takes apart the idea that there are 'good' and 'evil' people in the world - it shows that things are not as black and white as that.\\" Gallagher commented: \\"I wanted to write a police drama that I would like to watch. One that would thrill me and disturb me. One that would shake me up and be about subjects that really matter, not just the stories, but the way that the stories are told. I tried to take the characters to places that they wouldn't want to go, were scared to go and to see what happened. I wanted to try and take a daring and confrontational approach. This wasn't me and Marc (Munden, the director) indulging some arty idea but looking for ways to crank up the tension, to delight in the storytelling and keep the thing moving at a real pace. Sometimes we have to hang on for two or three scenes until it adds up, 'till the pieces slot together. But when we get there, it's more fulfilling than having it handed to us on a plate. This series isn't based on any particular crime or case, but on what I feel is in the air, how we react when awful crimes happen. We live in angry times and I wanted to build Conviction around how people feel, how they react, how they relate and why.\\" Producer Ann Harrison-Baxter commented: \\"The majority of crime dramas are very black and white, good versus evil, and the police represent good. But life isn't actually like that ‚Äì it's very grey in all those areas of morality. Bill has taken a genre and a group of characters that are portrayed in a particular way in British drama, and turns it all on its head... (The characters) are detectives, they work for the police force, but first and foremost they are human beings like you and I and although they are meant to be the upholders of morality and good, they are human and they do have emotions and sometimes those emotions get the better of them.\\" Cast * William Ash as D.C.

Milano, Rusconi, 1979, 189 pages. The title recalls the ordeal, a judicial practice by which, during Middle Ages, the guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by subjecting them to an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience. Theme Runo, a young scribe at the papal court in Rome, discovers that the famous Donation of Constantine, upon which the temporal power of the Pope is based, is a forgery. His disillusionment is so great that he leaves Rome and sets out on a life of adventure in search of the truth about himself, the world and the Church. In his wanderings through medieval Italy (it is the year 1000) he encounters many situations, some happy and some terrifying, and manages to defeat all his enemies. Master and guide in his journey is a wise monk, Petro, who faced himself directly the ordeal bearing his faith up above his head. In this journey, Runo takes part into battles, discovers true love in the arms of a beautiful countryside girl, and, eventually, meets the young emperor Otto III, to whom he reveals the secret of the forgery in the hope that Otto will build a Church without temporal possessions and power. Critics The novel became very appreciated by the critics very soon after the publication, winning the prestigious Premio Selezione Campiello in 1979.Winners of the Premio Selezione Campiello Inspired novels One year after the publication of L‚Ä≤ordalia, the novel The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco, was published. There are many similarities between the two novels: the time set (Middle Ages), the novel typology (meant as a bildungsroman, or coming-of-age novel), as well as the main character (a novice) and his helper (a wise monk, with the role of the master). These many similarities, and the notoriety of L‚Ä≤ordalia in 1979,in Italian: from the Journal \\"Letture\\", n. 614, February 2005: Memoria. Marco Beck ricorda Italo Alighiero Chiusano of whom a literature expert such as Umberto Eco was definitely aware, make us think that L'ordalia could be one of the sources of inspiration of some parts of The Name of the Rose (which was written between 1978 and 1980Wikiquote of Umberto Eco). Moreover, the important role given by Chiusano to the main character's diary, symbol of his experience and evolution throughout all his adventures. It is chosen to link the main character's story, with the reader's one.

In English, it is sometimes given the common names box honeysuckle or Wilson's honeysuckle. It is widely used as a low hedging plant, and for topiary. It is also a popular low-maintenance ground cover plant for urban landscaping. Description The species is native to China, in the area of Yunnan and West Sichuan, where It grows in scrub form along streams at . L. nitida is a broadleaf evergreen shrub tall and wide if unclipped, with dark green, small leaves (6‚Äì16 millimeters long). The creamy white, fragrant flowers, appearing at the end of spring, are 6 millimeters long, and grow in pairs. The fruit (rarely formed on clipped specimens) is an inedible bluish-purple berry about 6 millimeters in diameter. The stems are layered one on top of the other giving the appearance of a haystack. The growth rate is moderate or fast growing. While resistant to deer and rabbits, it is attractive to birds. When planted, the species is easy to clip and needs frequent clipping because it flops if it grows to a height over 5 feet. The species is commonly confused with cotoneaster species. The difference between the two is that cotoneaster has alternate leaves while this species has opposite leaves. The Latin specific epithet nitida means ‚Äúshining‚Äô, in reference to its glossy leaves. Cultivars include 'Maigr√ºn', 'Baggesen's Gold' and 'Briloni' (a.k.a. 'Edmee Gold') Cultivation When planted, the species should be put in the full sun to light shade in fertile, well-drained soil. The species is more shade resistant than most honeysuckles. The species can tolerate drought and pollution. Lonicera nitida takes clipping well and makes a small hedge. The cultivar ‚ÄòBaggesen‚Äôs Gold‚Äô has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. At Osborne House, a holiday home built in 1845 on the Isle of Wight for Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert, there are L. nitida shrubs clipped in the form of stags rising from beds of Felicia amelloides, Festuca glauca, and scarlet pelargoniums. This plant is often used for bonsai. Because it is an energetic grower, it is possible to collect old and quite sizable L. nitida from the landscape or growing wild, cut most of the roots and branches off to start from scratch to build a new tree-like form.

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato- shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design; the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.  Description  There are six steps in the original technique: # Decide on the task to be done. # Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes). # Work on the task. # End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper. Click the \\"how\\" link and see step 4. Presumably, the piece of paper can be one's task list or similar. In any case, four check marks indicate a longer break (step 6). # If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3‚Äì5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6. # After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15‚Äì30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1. For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is the interval of time spent working. Regular breaks are taken, aiding assimilation. A short (3‚Äì5 minutes) rest separates consecutive pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. A longer (15‚Äì30 minute) rest is taken between sets. A goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible; when interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity must be recorded and postponed (using the inform ‚Äì negotiate ‚Äì schedule ‚Äì call back strategyhttps://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer- to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730) or the pomodoro must be abandoned. After task completion in a pomodoro, any time remaining could be devoted to activities such as: # Review and edit the work just completed. # Review the activities from a learning point of view: What did I learn? What could I do better or differently? # Review the list of upcoming tasks for the next planned Pomodoro time blocks, and start reflecting on or updating those tasks. Cirillo suggests: The stages of planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing are fundamental to the technique.Cirrilo, Francesco. The Pomodoro Technique: The Acclaimed Time-Management System That Has Transformed How We Work, p. 27. In the planning phase, tasks are prioritized by recording them in a \\"To Do Today\\" list. This enables users to estimate the effort tasks require. As pomodoros are completed, they are recorded, adding to a sense of accomplishment and providing raw data for subsequent self-observation and improvement. Tools The creator and his proponents encourage a low-tech approach, using a mechanical timer, paper, and pencil. The physical act of winding the timer confirms the user's determination to start the task; ticking externalises desire to complete the task; ringing announces a break. Flow and focus become associated with these physical stimuli. The technique has inspired application software for several platforms. Variations There are many variations on the Pomodoro Technique. These allow individuals to tailor the principles of the Pomodoro Technique to better suit their personal working style. Some variations include: *Work in 90 minute time periods. Rather than a 25 minute focus period, work in 90 minute blocks. This reflects a natural concentration cycle. *Work in natural time periods. There may be natural time markers in one's life: for example, the period between meetings, or the time until one's kids or partner come home, or the time until the dishwasher finishes. Use these to define focus periods. *Monitor periods of naturally high productivity, and from this data work out the best productivity system. All of these approaches preserve the core Pomodoro Technique principle of working in specific time blocks, but they adjust the periods to better suit individual needs.

The church, a fine example of Romanesque Revival architecture, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The church is a notable example of an adaptive reuse, having been converted into a synagogue and medical office building. Description and history The former Plymouth Congregational Church is located northwest of the New Haven Green in New Haven's Dwight neighborhood, at the northeast corner of Chapel and Sherman Streets. It is a large masonry structure, built out of brownstone with Romanesque Revival styling. The facade facing Church Street is historically its principal facade, with a gable flanked by square towers. The left tower is the taller of the two, with a turreted belfry level topped by a polygonal roof. Original main entrances are set in recesses at the base of this tower. The congregation for which the church was built was founded in 1831 as the Missionary Church, and met in rented spaces until 1848, when its first edifice was built in College Street. The congregation acquired the present lot in 1884, and built in the early 1900s. It was formally renamed the Plymouth Congregational Church at this building's dedication in 1901. The congregation peaked in size in 1929, and declined after World War II. The building was sold to the Temple Kezar Jewish congregation in 1949, and the congregation was eventually merged into the Center Church on the Green. The building was converted for use as a Jewish synagogue, a role it fulfilled until 1968, when Temple Kezar merged with Temple Beth El and moved into a new building. The building was abandoned and vacant for several years, inviting extensive vandalism and water damage.

At the trial level, Peoni was convicted as an accomplice to Dorsey's possession of the counterfeit bills.Bonnie, p. 691 Opinion of the Court In an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, the Second Circuit reversed Peoni's conviction. The court looked to the statute under which Peoni was indicted, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 550 (the predecessor to 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2), which punished anyone who \\"aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures\\" the commission of a crime. The court read this language to require purpose, and held that Peoni had no purpose regarding the use of the counterfeit bills once he had passed them to Regno. Peoni had no purpose regarding Dorsey's possession because Regno was free to do whatever he wanted with the bills.Bonnie, p. 692 References External links * Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cases Category:United States federal criminal case law Category:1938 in United States case law Category:Counterfeit money ","title":"United States v.

In 1931, he graduated from Keio University. In the same year, he entered Keio University's department of preventive medicine. In 1933, he worked in Kuryu Rakusen-en Sanatorium. In 1939, he worked in Tohoku Shinseien Sanatorium. In 1942, he worked in Musashi Sanatorium for the War Disabled. In 1943, he served as the acting director in Ehime Sanatorium for the War Disabled. In 1944, he was the acting director in Tokyo Sanatorium for the War Disabled. In December 1944, he was appointed the director of Suruga Sanatorium for the War Disabled. In December 1945, he became the director of Suruga Sanatorium. In August 1957, he was appointed director of Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium following the retirement of Kensuke Mitsuda. In April 1978, he was made honorary director of Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium. He was given the First Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1978. Takashima died on January 23, 1985. War and leprosy In 1947, he delivered a special lecture on war and leprosy at the Congress of the Japanese Leprosy Association, which was reported in the next year.War and leprosy (1948), Takashima S. Lepra, 17, 8-14, 1948. (in Japanese) He obtained correct data since he had worked for sanatoriums for the war disabled. He reported that the total number of leprosy in-patients who developed during service was 732; 0.13 per 1000 mobilized. If other conditions were included, he estimated that an average of 100 patients developed leprosy among soldiers and sailors per year. He also pointed out that the number of military patients per localities correlated with the number of patients who lived in these localities, and suggested that the military patients had been infected in childhood. Another point he stressed was that only 3 officers developed leprosy, while all others were soldiers and sailors. Other work A Guide to Leprosy Medicine In 1970, he compiled a textbook \\"A guide to leprosy (Rai Igaku no Tebiki)\\", which was the only one textbook of leprosy at that time. It was one year prior to the publication of the first edition of the Handbook of Leprosy by William Jopling. Nagashima Bridge He tried to construct a bridge to Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium from Japan Proper, and the bridge was completed in 1988. It was a step toward lessening leprosy stigma.

Retrieved 2016-07-30.Horowitz, Brian. Empire Jews: Jewish Nationalism and Acculturation in 19th- and Early 20th- Century Russia. Bloomington: Slavica Publishers, 2009. . Chapter 7: \\"The Society for the Promotion of Enlightenment among the Jews of Russia and the Evolution of the Petersburg Russian-Jewish Intelligentsia, 1893-1905\\", p. 116-138; here: p. 116. It was founded as a learned society in December 1863, in Saint Petersburg, at that time the capital city of the Russian Empire, by prominent Russian Jews, including Joseph Yozel G√ºnzburg, who became president; his son Horace G√ºnzburg, first vice-president; Rabbi A. Neumann, second vice- president; Leon Rosenthal, treasurer; Abraham Brodski; and I. Brodski. Lithuanian scholar Mattityahu Strashun was an honorary member. The aim of the society as set forth in its constitution was as follows: :\\"To promote culture among the Russian Jews and to infuse into them love therefor. To this end the society will endeavor to spread the knowledge of the Russian language among them; it will publish and assist others in publishing useful works and journals in Russian, as well as in Hebrew, that will aid in carrying out the purposes of the society; and it will, further, assist the young in devoting themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and of the sciences.\\" Branch societies The idea of establishing such a society in Russia may have been suggested by the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, which was founded in 1860. The time was ripe for such an organization in Russia, inasmuch as the awakening of the Jews of that country to their cultural needs was in progress. There were, however, some drawbacks, on account of which the society was unable to carry out its program in its entirety. Its scope of activity was necessarily limited by the disabilities of the Russian Jews and there was, moreover, a lack of interest on the part of the intellectual Jews themselves, the greater number of whom strove to shake themselves free from everything Jewish. The society thus had to struggle on for some time and to satisfy its ambition with minor achievements. For several years the number of members was less than 250, and in 1880 it was not quite 350; the annual income was less than 12,000 rubles. From that year onward, however, interest in the society increased. The anti-Jewish riots, on the one hand, and the restrictions imposed by the government, on the other, impelled Russian Jews to trust to self-help and to take thenceforth more interest in their own institutions. In the next year (1880) the society inaugurated a branch, with a special fund, for the promotion of agriculture and industry among Russian Jews. The number of members increased to 552 and its yearly income was more than doubled (28,246 rubles). But here, again, the attitude of the Russian government toward the Jews checked the society's operations, the prohibition against Jews engaging in agriculture having become more stringent with the accession of Alexander III, thus defeating the object of the new agricultural section. In the other branches, however, the activity of the society was considerable, the report of its twentieth anniversary (1884) showing an expenditure from the foundation of the society of 78,788 rubles for the support of students at universities, academies, and industrial institutions, and for the maintenance of private and public schools; in addition 35,556 rubles were expended in connection with useful publications issued by the society itself or on its initiative. At the same time, a greater interest in Hebrew literature began to manifest itself among the members, and a special fund for its promotion was voted in 1884. Chief lines of activity The operations of the society have since extended far beyond Saint Petersburg. As early as 1865 a branch had been founded at Odessa, which issued and maintained the newspaper Den (\\"The Day\\"). Other branches were later established at Moscow, Riga, and several other cities; but the most effective work has been done by the Odessa branch. The chief lines of the society's activity are the following: # Assistance of Jewish students at the Russian universities; # Maintenance of general and industrial schools for Jewish children; # Aid to Jewish libraries; # Encouragement of Jewish authors and publication of works (in Hebrew and Russian) pertaining to Judaism, prizes being offered for the same; and # Promotion of a knowledge of Jewish science by series of lectures, particularly in Saint Petersburg. Unfortunately, the society has to struggle for existence. Its educational work is being rendered less important in proportion as education progresses among Russian Jews generally. Moreover, the society having been founded at a time when the idea of assimilation with the Russians was prevalent among the cultured Jews, and having, more or less, retained this spirit, it has now to face an internal conflict with the Jewish national tendencies that have recently been awakened in Russian Jewry, and with which many of the members of the society are strongly imbued.

It was the second of three major snowstorms during the 1960‚Äì1961 winter. The storm ranked as Category 3, or \\"major\\", on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale. Synoptic history The storm was preceded by a cold front that brought cold air, associated with an area of high pressure north of the Great Lakes, into the area. The low pressure system quickly moved towards the East Coast on January 19 from the southern United States. Its track was unusually far north, passing through the mid-Ohio Valley. The low tracked from Tennessee to the southern Appalachian Mountains, and moved off the coast of Virginia. It rapidly strengthened; from 0000 UTC to 1200 UTC on January 20, it intensified from 996 millibars to 972 mb.Kocin and Uccellini, p. 402 The storm's intensification was accompanied by an increase in the precipitation. It ultimately moved northeastward along the coast and reached its lowest barometric pressure of 964 mb late on January 20, while situated east of New England. Widespread heavy snow fell from West Virginia and Virginia through Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, with lighter amounts spreading into Maine. Totals of over were recorded from eastern Pennsylvania through central New England.Kocin and Uccellini, p. 401 Snowfall amounts were similar to that of a winter storm in February 1958. Following the storm, an anticyclone in the central United States maintained the cold air. Impact The nor'easter is sometimes referred to as the Kennedy Inaugural Snowstorm, since it struck on the eve of the inauguration of John F. Kennedy.Kocin and Uccellini, p. 400 In advance of the storm, the Weather Bureau predicted a mix of rain and snow in Washington, D.C., but instead, the precipitation remained frozen. The unexpected snowfall resulted in \\"chaos\\", and thousands of cars were marooned or abandoned, triggering massive traffic jams. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \\"The Engineers teamed up with more than 1,000 District of Columbia employees to clear the inaugural parade route. Luckily much equipment and some men had been pre-positioned and were ready to go. In the end the task force employed hundreds of dump trucks, front-end loaders, sanders, plows, rotaries, and flamethrowers to clear the way.\\" The snowstorm prevented former President Herbert Hoover from flying into Washington National Airport and attending Kennedy's swearing-in ceremony. Additionally, the storm dealt the final blow to the Texas Tower #4, a USAF radar installation in the Atlantic Ocean, causing her to sink with the loss of all 28 crew aboard.http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/05/02/the-tragedy- of-texas-tower-4/ See also *Climate of the United States *List of NESIS storms References * Category:Nor'easters Category:1961 meteorology Category:1961 in Washington, D.C.

The site of the development, which declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010 May, was on the Columbia River, east of Astoria. Bradwood Landing history The site where NorthernStar Natural Gas wanted to build the Bradwood Landing LNG terminal is upriver from Astoria. The site is zoned \\"marine industrial\\" and was once the location of Bradwood, a company town of the Bradley-Woodward Lumber Company. The mill closed in 1962 and burned in 1965. The surrounding area is now a mostly undeveloped mix of forest and wetland. NorthernStar began the process by filing a notice of intent with Oregon state regulators in April 2005. The project was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September 2008. State permits were not obtained. On May 4, 2010, NorthernStar Natural Gas filed for bankruptcy, pulling funding for this project. Bradwood specifics The development would cover of a lot. The facility would consist of two storage tanks, with a peak send-out capacity of 1.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day. Benefits  When the Bradwood Landing project was initiated, it appeared that domestic sources of natural gas were dwindling. Since then, new technology for extracting shale gas in the United States has reversed those predictions as ample new sources of natural gas are being tapped within the United States. However, by having access to both domestic and foreign sources of gas, West Coast natural gas suppliers would have more freedom to play the market and could potentially keep gas prices lower. Construction of Bradwood Landing would have generated 450 construction jobs over a three-year period, plus 65 permanent jobs once the project was complete. The project could bring additional economic benefits to the area by stimulating the local economy and increasing revenue from taxes and port fees. Drawbacks Environmental groups, led by Columbia Riverkeeper, have been at the forefront of opposition to Bradwood Landing, but there are drawbacks to the project in a number of arenas. Environmental issues The construction of Bradwood Landing would require disruption of important salmon habitat, and is in an area where the Chinook salmon and Coho salmon populations have been designated as threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The project calls for dredging of 700,000 cubic yards of material from the Columbia River Engines expelling hot water are another issue as cold water is crucial to the salmon. Natural gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, but much of that benefit is lost when the gas in imported. LNG has as much as 30 percent higher greenhouse gas impact than domestic natural gas The State of Oregon's analysis found imported LNG to be equivalent to coal for greenhouse gas emissions. The construction of an affiliated natural gas pipeline raises additional environmental concerns. Safety LNG tankers and regassification plants in general have good safety records. In the unlikely event of an accident or terrorist attack, however, the results could be catastrophic. Spilled LNG disperses into the air; however, due to its temperature (-260 ¬∞F), it hugs the Earth's surface until it warms by 100-degrees F. Until sufficiently warming to rise into the atmosphere, LNG vapor that can drift with the wind and is capable of igniting if it comes into contact with an ignition source and if the concentration of natural gas in the vapor is between five and 15 percent. (Note: Natural gas vapors have a gas-to-air flammability range of 5-15%, a 10% range, the most flammability of all common hydrocarbon fuels. Gasoline's flammability range is 1.4-7.6%, a 6.2% range. Propane's flammability range is 2.2-9.5%, a 7.3% range.) A report prepared by Sandia National Laboratories analyzing the risks of a large LNG spill over water describes a hazard zone of over a mile for an accidental spill, and of for an intentionally caused breach, as in a terrorist attack. Policy The State of Oregon has objected to the process by which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved Bradwood Landing. The state's Department of Energy determined that Oregon was not in need of additional imported natural gas This raises the question of how LNG fits into Oregon's energy future, with some opponents concerned that the gas would end up being sent to California or that ultimately the terminal could be used to export gas from the United States. The Palomar Pipeline A joint venture of TransCanada and NW Natural, the Palomar Gas Transmission pipeline would be long. A map of the proposed route of the pipeline shows its northern terminus at the Bradwood Landing interconnect. The route travels south through Clatsop, Washington and Yamhill counties, then veers east near McMinnville to pass through Marion, Clackamas and Wasco counties to join an existing pipeline near Shaniko, Oregon. The route includes a large amount of rural private property as well as land in the Mount Hood National Forest. In July 2010, Palomar's sponsors slowed down the application process to review their options in light of Bradwood's bankruptcy.

Hattersley was a textile machinery manufacturer from Keighley, West Yorkshire in England, founded in 1789 and responsible for the Hattersley Standard Loom and other types of looms.  History Richard Hattersley, the founder of the company, served his apprenticeship at Kirkstall Forge. He set up his own business in 1789 at Stubbings Mill, Airworth, manufacturing nuts, bolts, screws and small parts for textile machines. Richard's son George came into the business and took over its running. In 1834 he was asked to build a power loom for weaving worsted cloth which previously had only been woven on handlooms. Although the first loom was produced in 1834, it was never delivered as it was smashed up in transit by a group of handloom weavers of the Luddite persuasion fearful for their livelihood. The replacement was delivered. Hattersley's prospered and developed an extensive catalogue. They adding new products to their range, which included tobacco machines and garden furniture. Hattersley's continued to prosper, with the number of employees peaking at around 1100 just prior to the First World War. They also ventured into production and the subsidiary companies have survived where the parent did not. It closed in 1983. Products Hattersley produced a large range of types of loomsGraces Guide over 120 years for all sectors of the market, from the narrow band looms to sheeting looms. At one time, they had about 26 basic models in their catalogue. Hattersley Dobby Loom In 1867 George Hattersley and Sons created a loom with a dobby head. A dobby a mechanical heald lifting device which allowed weaving of much more intricate patterns on any looms to which it was fitted. Hattersley Narrow Fabric Loom In 1908 Hattersley developed the world's first smallware (or narrow fabric) loom, these were suitable for weaving wicks for oil lamps, and the webbing that is used in the automotive industry. To demonstrate this loom, the firm bought the Cabbage Mills and later the Greegate Shed in Keighley where they started production of these products. The firm survives today as Hattersley Aladdin Ltd. Hattersley Standard Loom In 1921 the Hattersley Standard Loom, designed and built by the company, was to sell in its thousands, bringing considerable financial success to the company.History of Hattersleys Stephen H. Smith After the recapitalisation boom of 1919 cotton yarn production peaked in 1926, a further investment was sparse. Rayon, artificial silk, was invented in the 1930s in Silsden nearby, and the Hattersley Silk Loom was adapted to weave this new fabric. Hattersley Domestic Loom The Hattersley Domestic Loom was part of the Hattersley Domestic System that include other machines such as pirn winder and warping mill. It was a compact machine, combining all the know how and precision engineering of the nineteenth century with the need for a treadle operated loom. This looms has tappets to control up to 8 shafts, healds or boards; most simply have 4 shafts and a set of four 2/2 Twill tappets and four plain weave tappets. 5,6,7,and 8 pick tappets were available. In order to cope with the different gearings the tappet drive cog on the bottom drive shaft could be adjusted and there are two sizes of tapped mounting drive cogs. There was also a Dobby version. The first thirty Hattersley's were sent to the Outer Hebrides in 1919. These were 36 inches in the reed space and single shuttle. In 1924 the first six shuttle, 40 inch reed space looms arrived in Stornoway and this type of loom was the most commonly used loom in the islands' Harris Tweed Industry.Hattersley Loom Club, Feb 2007, accessed 2010-02-10 See also * Hattersley loom  References  External links  *A history written by a descendant *Hattersley Narrow Fabric History *Hattersley Domestic Loom Club Category:Companies based in the City of Bradford Category:British companies established in 1789 Category:Textile machinery manufacturers Category:Weaving Category:Keighley Category:Defunct companies based in Yorkshire Category:1789 establishments in England ","title":"Geo.

The MSRRA was written to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) to include protection of military spouses, with regards to voting, property and taxes, and provide equitable treatment of military spouses. Congressman Carter sponsored the bill after two military spouses, Army spouse Rebecca Noah Poynter and Navy spouse Joanna Williamson, approached him about residency concerns resulting from military moves and increasing deployments due to the War on Terrorism. Military spouses were required to become a resident of the state where they resided, in contrast to service members that could maintain a home state. During the bill's life in the 110th Congress, H.R. 6070 had 72 co- sponsors. It is believed that the bill could have passed during the 110th Congress but due to the housing crisis in 2008 it was quickly dismissed. On February 25, 2009 of the 111th United States Congress, Congressman Carter reintroduced MSRRA; H.R. 1182. Senator Richard Burr introduced the companion bill, S. 475, to the Senate Committee of Veterans' Affairs on February 25, 2009.

She became the World Sprint Champion in 2012, setting world records in both the sprint combination and the 500 metres. She held the world record in the sprint combination until Heather Richardson bettered it in January 2013, and the world record in 500 metres until Lee Sang-hwa broke it in November 2013. The time, 36.94 seconds, was the Chinese record until broken by Wang Beixing in November 2013. Career Yu Jing made her World Cup debut at the Changchun meeting in 2008, after winning a gold and a bronze at the Asian Championships the year before. Already a week later, Yu won her first World Cup victory in the 500 m at Nagano, and a second-place in the 1000 m. During the 2009 World Sprint Championships in Moscow, she managed to secure a bronze medal. The rest of the season, she raced consistently and acquired multiple podium places in the World Cup, but there were no more victories. In the World Cup total, Yu placed 5th in the 500 m and 9th in the 1000 m. At the 2009 World Single Distance Championships in Richmond, Yu missed the podium in both the 500 m and 1000 m events, finishing 4th and 12th, respectively. Her next season at the top level was a lot less fruitful than the first. In the World Cup, she was struggling to copy the results of her first year, and at the end of the season, she was never anywhere near reaching the podium. At the 2010 World Sprint Championships in Obihiro, Yu finished 6th. Yu also represented China at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, but finished a disappointing 32nd in the 1000 m. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Yu returned as a force to be reckoned with and was on the podium three times in the 500 m World Cup stops in Changchun and Obihiro in December 2010. She chose not to compete anymore in the World Cup in order to concentrate on the 2011 Asian Winter Games in Astana, starting in the end of January 2011. The gamble turned out to be successful, and on 1 February, she managed to take the gold medal in the 500 m event, beating Wang Beixing and Lee Sang-hwa. When the World Cup circuit started again in the fall of 2011, Yu began to dominate in the 500 m. At the first meeting in Chelyabinsk, she won both of the races over that distance, each time with a winning margin over 0.4 seconds. After skipping the second meeting in Astana, she likewise went on to triumph in both 500 m races in Heerenveen and also gained a second place in the 1000 m. Obviously, she could be a major contender for the 2012 World Sprint Championships in Calgary, and perhaps the only one capable of challenging the reigning champion, Christine Nesbitt. On the first day of the championships, Yu had technical trouble in the 500 m and finished a disappointing 7th there, as well as gaining a respectable 4th spot in the 1000 m. After the first day of racing, she was in the fifth position, 0.665 points behind Nesbitt, who had set a world record in the 1000 m and looked like the clear favorite. On the second 500 m, Yu was paired with the then-current world record holder Jenny Wolf, but raced phenomenally, and passed the finishing line setting the time 36.94, thereby snatching the world record and becoming the first woman ever to skate a 500 m in under 37 seconds. She also overtook Nesbitt as the leader of the championships, though having a slim lead of 0.57 seconds before the final 1000 m, where the two would face each other in the final pair. There, Yu started aggressively and had the lead over Nesbitt after 200 m and 600 m. As expected, Nesbitt had the better last round and went on to win this distance, but she only managed beat Yu with 0.54 seconds. Yu finished with the time 1.13.47, and cut her personal best with over a second. In the end, Yu became the world champion by only 0.02 point margin, and also set the world record in the sprint combined.

Lisha Kill lies on New York Route 5 (Central Avenue) in the western section of the town. The hamlet received its name from the creek of the same name, Lisha Kill, kill being Dutch for creek or stream. The stream is also referred to as Lisha's Kill and received its name from a local legend about a Native American woman who is buried along its banks. History Lisha Kill's history is intimately tied to the creek of the same name. Originally called Lysiens Kill, local legend says Lisha's Kill is named for a Native American woman who was buried along its banks. Some of the earliest settlers were of the Lansing family, a family long associated with nearby Albany, Cohoes, and Lansingburgh; Jacob Lansing is considered the first to have settled in the area and John V.A. Lansing, another early settler, arrived in 1792. His house still stands and has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985.Barnet, David G., Town of Colonie Historian's Office, John V. A. Lansing Farmhouse, Billsen Cemetery and Archaeological Site. nomination document, 1982, National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places, Washington, D.C. Henry O. Lansing owned a saw mill powered by water or steam from the Lisha Kill in 1875. Several Lansings in the late 19th century were deacons, elders, and officers of the (Dutch) Reformed Church of Lisha's Kill. Colonel Jon T. A. Lansing and his four sons owned four farms consisting of bounded by Central Avenue, and Lisha Kill, Lansing and Consaul roads, the Town of Colonie Golf Course is built on over half of this acreage. The Albany and Schenectady Turnpike, built in 1799, connecting those two cities ran through the middle of Lisha Kill and had a toll-gate here. The hamlet quickly became thickly settled and well developed in the 19th century. There was a black smith, hotel, stores, a tavern run by Josiah Stanford (father of California Governor Leland Stanford); and a post office that was established in 1830. Two school houses served the local children, Watervliet School House (WSH) 7 (to the east on Consaul Road); and WSH 8 (in Stanford Heights). Today the children of Lisha Kill attend Veeder Elementary School and Lisha Kill Middle School (since 1959) east of the hamlet and then Colonie High as part of the South Colonie Central School District. The residents of Lisha Kill for the most part were of Dutch ancestry and belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church, they worshiped at the Niskayuna Reformed Church until 1852 when they petitioned the Classis of Schenectady for their own church. This was granted and the Dutch Reformed Church of Lisha's Kill began meeting in Watervliet School 8 until 1854 when a new church building was dedicated. The church still is in use as the second oldest Reformed Church in Colonie. Geography Lisha Kill is centered along Central Avenue (NY Route 5) in the western part of Colonie, between the cities of Albany and Schenectady. Lisha Kill is also the name of a creek that runs perpendicular to Central Avenue.

It can be found within their DC8 and Forensics8 software programs. A VVA can be used to color the sound of a digital recording by adding \\"tube-warmth\\" or \\"fat-bass\\" in addition to adding subtle harmonics to enhance very old or muffled recordings. The algorithms behind a VVA are based on real vacuum tube circuits and non-linearities, mathematically simulating the large-signal transfer functions of various vacuum tubes and output transformers found in amplifier designs. A majority of this data was originally derived from extensive bench measurements on real vacuum tube amplifier circuits under varying operating conditions by engineers Craig Maier and Rick Carlson in the early 1990s. A VVA is a direct mathematical reconstruction of the same signal passing through a physical electron tube amplifier. The VVA algorithm can be found in the Diamond Cut DC8 and DC Forensics8 software packages. It is also sold as a VST plug-in. Basic operating parameters VVA designs generally include a number of parameters that may be configured to change the sound and operating characteristics of the amplifier design: Operating point Historically referred to as the \\"Q\\" or bias point by engineers, the operating point of a vacuum tube is a condition generally fixed by the amplifier manufacturer. In general, the operating point determines the device's bias value at zero signal input and determines the distribution of harmonics introduced into the output of the amplifier. Tubes that operate with a higher operating point close to cutoff give more \\"headroom\\", enabling greater volume gains to be applied before signal degradation in the form of \\"breakup\\" or saturation results. By contrast, a lower operating point introduces more harmonic distortion into the final output as a result of the different non-linearity distribution near cut- off as compared to operation in the nominally linear portion of the characteristic. Some guitar amplifiers are designed to produce this type of distortion as its sound effect is considered desirable. Drive This describes how loudly the \\"physical\\" equivalent of the virtual valve amplifier is set. However, the output level of a VVA generally remains constant independent of drive due to internal gain compensation algorithms. Instead, the drive determines the amount of distortion that can be introduced into the output signal. As such, the Drive of a VVA describes the degree of modulation applied to a given vacuum tube amplifier circuit centered about the set operating point. The higher the drive level setting, the greater will be the production of predominantly even order harmonics due to the circuit's asymmetrical non-linearity. As a result, the VVA \\"effect\\" increases with increasing drive. Common vacuum tube types Triode 12AX7/ECC83 This is a high-mu dual triode that is generally incorporated into an RC coupled class A audio pre-amplifier configuration and its design is optimized to minimize harmonic distortion. This vacuum tube is still the industry standard pre-amplifier valve. It has a relatively flat linear operating region in the middle of its dynamic operating range, producing relatively lower levels of distortion compared to some of the other devices listed here. But, by moving the Operating Point to either the saturation or cutoff extreme, more \\"tube- warmth\\" effect can be produced by this device. Some VST effects emulate this tube. Triode 12AT7/ECC81 The 12AT7 high-mu dual triode was designed primarily for RF mixing applications where it was incorporated into the oscillator/mixer stage and used to heterodyne incoming RF signals with the local oscillator to create an intermediate frequency in TV and FM sets. Thus, it is intentionally designed to be extremely non-linear. Thus, circuits based around the 12AT7 exhibit a larger degree of non-linearity throughout the entire dynamic operating range, including the middle. As a result, it produces greater even-order harmonic distortion (less objectionable than odd-order distortion). Triode 12AU7/ECC82 The 12AU7 is a medium-mu dual triode often found in the driver / phase inverter stage of a push-pull power amplifier and also results in significant non-linearity in the middle of its dynamic operating curve. Pentode 6EJ7 The 6EJ7 pentode and its equivalents are often found in high-gain vacuum tube microphone amplifiers which require the sharp cutoff of a pentode. It generally produces a very pleasant \\"tube-warmth\\" effect when the operating point is properly set. This device is the same as the European type EF183. Pentode 6267/EF86  The 6267 / EF86 pentode was a vacuum tube well suited for use in low-level pre- amplifiers where low noise and minimal microphonics were important. Its high- gain characteristics and family of operating curves make for useful harmonic distortion and signal compression properties. Common vacuum tube amplifier types Circuits may be \\"single-ended\\", using a single output device (or several connected in parallel), or \\"push-pull\\", using paired devices configured to cancel out even-order distortion products and reduce output transformer magnetisation. Bias of a push-pull amplifier may be set to make both sides conduct at all times (amplifier class A), to make only one side conduct at a time (class B), or intermediate (class AB). Class A uses more power for the same output (i.e., is less efficient), can produce less output power from the same devices, and produces lower distortion, than classes AB and B.  2-Stage Class A These devices generally consisted of a 12AU7 medium-mu triode driving a single 6L6GC beam power pentode audio output valve or similar. Its effects are distinctive due to convolution of the non- linearity of the triode interacting with those of the pentode, with both devices operating in class-A mode. The 6L6GC is similar in performance to the industrial type 5881, and also the European type KT66. 2-Stage Class AB Often consisting of a 12AU7 phase inverter / driver, pushing a pair of 6L6GC beam power pentodes. The symmetrical push-pull circuit cancels out and reduces even-order distortion products compared with a single-ended circuit. The operating point is hard-wired and cannot be adjusted. 2A3 push-pull Also known as a \\"retro‚Äìtriode\\" amplifier, it was invented in the 1930s and incorporated a directly heated cathode resulting in a high power output. It was often used in theatrical applications and public address systems. This vacuum amplifier typically exhibits a more linear output transfer characteristic than its pentode push-pull counterpart and as a result produces a characteristic clean sound. The particular devices used to create the 2A3 VVA models were of the \\"dual‚Äìplate\\" variety taken from unused stock manufactured for the military by RCA Victor in 1953. This configuration is favoured by many jazz musicians including Les Paul who reportedly used this amplifier configuration to cut all the records made from his home studio.DC 7.5 & DC 7 User's Manual 2A3 single-ended This is a single ended class A vacuum tube power amplifier implemented using the 2A3 power triode. It exhibits reasonably good linearity with dominant even distortion products. Vacuum tube exciter Because of the non-linear properties and distortion products of vacuum tubes and their associated amplification circuits, they are useful in the simulation of a vacuum tube rectifier (6X4) to produce harmonics. Asymmetry between the positive- and negative-going transfer function establishes the relationship between the degree of even and odd harmonics produced.Diamond Cut DC8 Users Guide See also *Tube sound References Category:Valve amplifiers ","title":"Virtual Valve Amplifier"},{"id":"26155166","text":"The February 2010 Khyber bombing was a suicide bombing in Khyber Agency in Pakistan, on February 10, 2010.

Ordway as President of the Boston Art Club Alfred T. Ordway (March 9, 1821 ‚Äì November 17, 1897) was an American landscape and portrait painter, and one of the founding fathers of the Boston Art Club. Early years Alfred was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts to mother Currier, and father Thomas Ordway on March 9, 1821. With his father being the city's clerk, Alfred spent the majority of his childhood in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he attended the public schools. His family can be traced back to the early 17th century when James Ordway settled in Dover, New Hampshire. Both his parents fought in the Revolutionary War, and his grandfather, Nehemiah Ordway, a physician in Amesbury, Massachusetts, was put in charge \\"to form and equip a company for Bunker Hill.\\" He first studied under a sign painter in Lowell, then portrait artist George Peter Alexander Healy, in Boston. One of his first commissions was to paint portraits of all the presidents to adorn the Lowell Museum, which shortly after he finished the museum burned to the ground. Career In 1845, Ordway opened up his studio on Tremont Row in Boston, around the same time he and friend, Benjamin Champney, founded the Boston Art Club. He also spent the fall up north with Miss Bangs, Benjamin Champney, Richard William Hubbard, and Sanford Gifford painting landscapes in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. He first exhibited his works at the Boston Athenaeum in 1855, and in 1856 he became Director of Exhibitions of the Boston Athenaeum till 1863, all the while exhibiting his own works each year of his eight-year term. After leaving the Director's position, he began to frequently exhibit his works in New York at the National Academy of Design and the Brooklyn Art Association. In 1898, his works were exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago. By 1890, the aging artist would spend each painting season in North Conway, New Hampshire. He focused his works mainly on New England landscapes particularly: mountain streams, summer valleys, and mountain peaks with a poetic feel for nature. As he often said, he \\"tried to paint nature exactly as he saw it.\\" According to The New York Times obituary, Alfred Ordway died on November 17, 1897, of heart disease while visiting a friend in Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts.

In 1921, together with a handful of other people with biological rarities from Europe, Laurello arrived in the United States. Laurello could turn his head 180 degrees. In the words of fellow sideshow performer Percilla Berjano, known as the \\"Monkey Girl\\", \\"[Laurello] could put his head all the way around\\". To accomplish this feat, he reportedly practised rotating his head for three years and also had to \\"dislocate various vertebrae\\". Being born with a slightly bent spine might have also aided Laurello in pulling off his act of flexibility. For a period of time, Laurello was billed at the Bailey Circus as \\"Bobby the Boy with the Revolving Head\\". Laurello also worked at the New York City-based Hubert's Museum, mostly during the winter, as well as Ringling Brothers and Coney Island. During his stint at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Odditoriums in the 1930s, Laurello managed to attract massive crowds. When performing, Laurello preferred to don a white shirt. He also trained dogs and cats to do acrobatic tricks. Personal life There is not much documented about Laurello's personal life. He was in two different marriages; his first one being Laura [Prechtl] Emmerling (born 1885), and the two had one son, named Alexander Emmerling (1905-1960). After their divorce, he then met and married a woman named Emilie [Wittl] Emmerling (1895-1977), and they had two sons together: Albert (1922-1945) and Walter Emmerling (1926-1983). Berjano described Laurello as \\"perhaps a Nazi\\" who \\"didn't like the American flag\\". On April 30, 1931, Laurello was arrested by Baltimore police during a tent-packed performance for abandoning his spouse and two sons, after she lodged a complaint via telegram. He was reportedly found standing on a platform with his back and face looking towards the crowd, and when the two officers confronted him, he turned his head around and winked at them both, then was placed under arrest.

Al-Jafr is considered to be composed of two skin boxes in which were kept various books of the past Prophets and the books inherited from Muhammad, Ali and Fatimah to the rest of Ahl al-Bayt, with each new Imam receiving them from his dying predecessor Imam, as well as the armour and weapons of Muhammad. Al-Jafr was reportedly one of the sources and origins of knowledge acquired by the 12 Imams, and the sixth Imam of Twelver and Ismai'ili Shi'ite Islam, Ja'far al- Sadiq, took pride in having possession of al-Jafr that comprised the hidden knowledge of Muhammad. The later Twelver Imams were accustomed to refer at times to the sacred and secret book of al-Jafr, which was left in their keeping by Ali and belief in the existence of al-Jafr with the Imams was firm, according to the Twelver Shia. The 12 Imams also learned the science of Huruf (letters of the alphabet) from al-Jafr and used this science to derive facts and rulings from al-Jafr.Henry Corbin, Trilogie ismaelienne, Paris: Maisonneuve, 1961, p. 30.

Al-Jafr al-Abyadh has 14 portions, and each portion has 14 divisions.Shia-crescent.com: Defending the Imam of our time CHAPTER NINETEEN: ON AL-REZA'S WORDS ON THE SIGN OF THE IMAM * A bag that contains the armour and weapons of imam ali, including the sword Zulfiqar, and the Islamic rules, directives and matters about and involving wars. These are all contained in the other part of al-Jafr called al-Jafr al-A·∏•mar (). * The knowledge of the Israelite scholars. Hadiths alleging its existence The following are Twelver ahadith on the existence of al-Jafr: * Shaykh Kulayni narrates from Abu al-Hasan that Imam Musa al-Kadhim said, \\"My son, 'Ali, is the eldest and most beloved of my children. He reads Jafr along with me, while no one except the Prophet (i.e. Muhammad) and his successors look at it.\\" * It has been narrated on the authority of \`AbdullƒÅh ibn SinƒÅn that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq said, when we mentioned before him the activities of the descendants of Imam Al-Hasan and also the Jafr, \\"By Allah I swear; we keep two papers made of skins of goat and sheep. These two papers comprise the dictation of the Messenger of Allah with the handwriting of (Imam) 'Ali.\\" The Imam remained silent for a while and then said, \\"With us there is al-Jafr. Do they know what al-Jafr is?\\" I asked, \\"What is al-Jafr?\\" The Imam said, \\"It is a container made of skin that contains the knowledge of the prophets and the executors of their wills. It is the knowledge of the scholars in the past from the Israelites.\\"Kitab al-Kafi: Vol. 1, Hadith 635, Ch. 40, h1 * A number of people has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Ali ibn Al-Hakam from Al-Husayn ibn Abu  øAla æ who has said that he heard Abu  øAbdallah say the following: \\"With me is the white Jafr.\\" The narrator has said that he asked the Imams \\"What is in it?\\" The Imam said, \\"In it there is the Psalms of David, the Torah of Moses, the Gospel of Jesus, the Suhuf of Abraham, the laws that explain the lawful and unlawful matters, and Mushaf of Fatimah in which, I do not think there is nay thing from the Holy Quran. In it there is all that people need us to do for them and so that we would not need any one else. In it there is information even about a lash, half of a lash and one forth of a lash and about the amount of compensation for a scratch caused to someone. \\"With me there is the red Jafr.\\" The narrator has said that he asked the Imam, \\"What is in the red Jafr?\\" The Imam said, \\"In it there is the Armaments. It is because it only is opened for bloodshed. The owner of the sword opens it to kill.\\" The narrator has said that  øAbdallah ibn Abu Ya øfur asked the Imam, \\"May Allah keep you well, do the descendents of Al- Hasan know this? The Imam said, \\"Yes, I swear by Allah, they know it just as they know the night that it is night and the day that it is the day, but jealousy and worldly gains cause them to act in denial and rejection.

She is an elected member of the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS). She was a board member of the Earth Sciences and Resources division of the NAS from 1995 until 2000. In 2005, she was awarded the Urey Medal, by the European Association of Geochemistry. In 2006, she was awarded the Harry H. Hess Medal, by the American Geophysical Union. She is currently the director of NEAT ORU (Nanomaterials in Environment, Agriculture, and Technology Organized Research Unit), a primary program in nanogeoscience. She is Distinguished Professor at University of California, Davis. Early life and education She graduated from Bronx High School of Science in New York. She received B.S. (1963), M.S. (1964), and Ph.D. (1967) in physical chemistry from University of Chicago, where she studied with Professor Ole J. Kleppa. Career and research In 1967, she went to Germany for postdoctoral work. She came back to the U.S. in 1968 and continued her postdoctoral work at Pennsylvania State University. Then she joined the Chemistry faculty at Arizona State University, for approximately five consecutive years. Later on, she moved to the Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences at Princeton University in 1985. She became the chair of that department from 1988 to 1991. In 1997, she moved to University of California at Davis and became an Interdisciplinary Professor of Ceramic, Earth, and Environmental Materials Chemistry. In 2001, she was chosen as the Edward Roessler Chair in Mathematical and Physical Sciences. As of 2013, she was appointed interim dean of Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the College of Letters and Sciences, at University of California at Davis. Her specializations include: Solid-state chemistry, Ceramics, Physics and Chemistry of Minerals, Geochemistry. Geochemistry Since 1997, she has built a unique high temperature calorimetry facility. She has also designed and enhanced the instrumentation. Navrotsky introduced and applied the method for measuring the energetics of crystalline oxides of glasses, amorphous, nanophase material, porous materials of hydrous phases and carbonates also more recently nitrides and oxynitrides. Obtaining the thermo chemical data is used to understand the compatibility and reactivity of materials in technological and geological application. The energetics provides insight into chemical bonding, order-disorder reactions, and phase transitions. Navrotsky's calorimetry has also been used in providing thermo chemical data for a variety of perovskite-related phases which has major consequences for convection and evolution on a planetary scale. One of Navrotsky's works has shown that many zeolitic and mesoporous phases have energies only slightly higher than those of their stable dense polymorphs. The energy is associated with the presence or absence of strained bond angles not with the density. Nanomaterials Her research is mainly focused on the structure and the stability of both natural and synthetic nanomaterials along with their dependence of temperature and pressure. She is also looking into the application of nanomaterials in geochemical pollutant transport in the air as it relates to the global climate change. Awards and honors *Alfred P.

The first logo was used from March to August 2000, the second from August 2000 to February 2001, and the third from February 2001 to September 2003. Nupedia was an English-language, web-based encyclopedia whose articles were written by volunteer contributors with appropriate subject matter expertise, reviewed by expert editors before publication, and licensed as free content. It was founded by Jimmy Wales and underwritten by Bomis, with Larry Sanger as editor-in-chief. Nupedia operated from October 1999 until September 2003. It is best known today as the predecessor of Wikipedia, but Nupedia had a seven-step approval process to control content of articles before being posted, rather than live wiki-based updating. Nupedia was designed by committee, with experts to predefine the rules, and it approved only 21 articles in its first year, compared to Wikipedia posting 200 articles in the first month, and 18,000 in the first year. Unlike Wikipedia, Nupedia was not a wiki; it was instead characterized by an extensive peer-review process, designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias. Nupedia wanted scholars (ideally with PhDs) to volunteer content. Before it ceased operating, Nupedia produced 25 approved articles that had completed its review process (three articles also existed in two versions of different lengths), and another 150 articles were in progress. Wales preferred Wikipedia's easier posting of articles, while Sanger preferred the peer-reviewed approach used by Nupedia and later founded Citizendium in 2006 as an expert-reviewed alternative to Wikipedia. In June 2008, CNET UK listed Nupedia as one of the greatest defunct Web sites in the still young history of the Internet, noting how the strict control had limited the posting of articles. History In October 1999, Jimmy Wales began thinking about an online encyclopedia built by volunteers and, in January 2000, hired Larry Sanger to oversee its development. The project officially went online on March 9, 2000. By November 2000, however, only two full-length articles had been published. From its beginning, Nupedia was a free content encyclopedia, with Bomis intending to generate revenue from online ads on Nupedia.com. Initially the project used a homegrown license, the Nupedia Open Content License. In January 2001, it switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. Also in January 2001, Nupedia started Wikipedia as a side-project to allow collaboration on articles before entering the peer review process. This attracted interest from both sides, as it provided the less bureaucratic structure favored by advocates of the GNE encyclopedia. As a result, GNE never really developed, and the threat of competition between the projects was averted. As Wikipedia grew and attracted contributors, it quickly developed a life of its own and began to function largely independently of Nupedia, although Sanger initially led activity on Wikipedia by virtue of his position as Nupedia's editor-in-chief. Besides leading to discontinuation of the GNE project, Wikipedia also led to the gradual demise of Nupedia. Due to the collapse of the internet economy at that time, Jimmy Wales decided to discontinue funding for a salaried editor-in- chief in December 2001, and Sanger resigned from both projects shortly thereafter. After Sanger's departure, Nupedia increasingly became an afterthought to Wikipedia; of the Nupedia articles that completed the review process, only two did so after 2001. As Nupedia dwindled into inactivity, the idea of converting it into a stable version of approved Wikipedia articles was occasionally broached, but never implemented. The Nupedia website at nupedia.com was shut down on September 26, 2003. Nupedia's encyclopedic content, which was often described as limited, has since been assimilated into Wikipedia. Editorial process classical era of music. Nupedia had a seven-step editorial process, consisting of: #Assignment #Finding a lead reviewer #Lead review #Open review #Lead copyediting #Open copyediting #Final approval and markup Authors were expected to have expert knowledge (although the definition of expert allowed for a degree of flexibility, and it was acknowledged that some articles could be written by a good writer, rather than an expert per se) and the editors approving articles for publication were expected \\"to be true experts in their fields and (with few exceptions) [to] possess PhDs\\". Ruth Ifcher was someone Sanger depended upon and worked closely with on Nupedia's early policies and procedures. Ifcher, holding several higher degrees, was a computer programmer and former copy editor and agreed to be volunteer chief copy editor. Software development Nupedia was powered by NupeCode collaborative software. NupeCode is free/open source software (released under the GNU General Public License) designed for large peer review projects. The code was available via Nupedia's CVS repository. One of the problems experienced by Nupedia during much of its existence was that the software lacked functionality. Much of the missing functionality had been mocked-up using underlined blocks of text which appeared to be hyperlinks, but actually were not. As part of the project, a new version of the original software (called \\"NuNupedia\\") was under development. NuNupedia was implemented for testing at SourceForge, but never reached a sufficient stage of development to replace the original software.

For over fifty years he had charge of the Public Health Department of Dublin Corporation. He was elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 1885. Early life and education Cameron was born 1830 in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Captain Ewen Cameron of Scotland and Belinda Smith of County Cavan. He was descended from Clan Cameron of Lochiel. He received his early education in chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry in Dublin. In 1852 he was elected professor to the newly founded Dublin Chemical Society, while continuing to study medicine at several schools and hospitals in Dublin. In 1854 he went to Germany where he graduated in philosophy and medicine. While there he published his translations of German poems and songs.Contemporary Medical Men, by John Leyland, vol. ii, Leicester, 1888 In 1862 he married Lucie Macnamara of Dublin. Medical career Upon his return to Ireland he became scientific advisor to the Irish government in criminal cases and over the years took part in many notable trials, including those relating to the Phoenix Park Murders. In 1862 he became public analyst for the City of Dublin, which position was later extended to 23 counties in Ireland. In 1867 he was elected Professor of Hygiene in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). He was also lecturer in chemistry in Dr Steevens' Hospital and the Ledwich School of Medicine, succeeding Dr. Maxwell Simpson, and retained these positions until 1874. In 1875 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. From 1858 to 1863 he was editor and part proprietor of the Agricultural Review, in which he wrote hundreds of articles on various subjects. In 1860‚Äì62, he was also editor of the Dublin Hospital Gazette and afterwards published many reports upon public health to the Dublin Journal of Medical Science. At this time he was in contact with many agricultural associations both in Ireland and abroad and received a number of awards and tributes. In 1874 he became Co-Medical Officer of Health for Dublin Corporation and two years later became Chief Medical Officer. Being in charge of the Public Health Department of Dublin City meant that he was always in the public eye, and due to the level of poverty and disease in the city at the time his work was cut out for him. He made many recommendations for improving the sanitation of dwellings and saw to it that unsanitary housing was either improved or closed down. He published numerous sanitary reports, papers on hygiene, the social life of the very poor and proper eating habits, those of the very poor in particular. On the other hand, he was in a position to meet the major figures of the day, from the monarchy and the government downwards. He was a member of several clubs in the city and dined with local and visiting celebrities alike, which he described in his reminiscences. In 1884 he became vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, and the following year became president. He was knighted in 1885 in consideration of \\"his scientific researches, and his services in the cause of public health\\". In 1886, he published his History of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and of the Irish Schools of Medicine. This work contains nearly 300 biographies of the most eminent medical men Ireland. Later life He was a leading Freemason in Dublin. In 1911 he was made a Freeman of the city and honoured by many from the Sinn F√©in Lord Mayor, Alderman Kelly, to the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Aberdeen. He died at his home on Raglan Road in Dublin on the 27th February 1921 and was interred in Mount Jerome Cemetery. At his death he left a son and two daughters; his eldest son, Captain Charles J. Cameron, died in a boating accident in Athlone in 1913, while another son, Lieutenant Ewen Henry Cameron, shot himself in a train in Newcastle in 1915 while on the way to the Western Front.

Kantorovitch came to radical politics as a young man, joining the Bund (Yiddish: ◊ê÷∑◊ú◊í◊¢◊û◊≤÷∑◊†◊¢◊® ◊≤◊ì◊ô◊©◊¢◊® ◊ê÷∑◊®◊ë◊¢◊ò◊¢◊® ◊ë÷º◊ï◊†◊ì ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ú◊ô◊ò◊¢ ◊§◊ï◊ô◊ú◊ô◊ü ◊ê◊ï◊ü ◊®◊ï◊°◊ú◊ê÷∑◊†◊ì ‚Äî Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poyln un Rusland, the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia.)\\"Kantorovitch Dies ‚Äî Long Ill,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 2, whole no. 75 (August 22, 1936), pg. 3. Kantorovitch emigrated to the United States in 1907, following the failure of the 1905 Russian Revolution.Anna Bercowitz, \\"Haim Kantorovitch,\\" American Socialist Monthly, vol. 5, no. 7 (October 1936), pp. 2-5. In America he worked in the garment industry of Boston, Massachusetts making raincoats. Kantorovitch helped to unionize the factory in which he worked, with the union first affiliating with the Industrial Workers of the World before moving to the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union at a later juncture. Kantorovitch was a native speaker of Yiddish but he was also able to read and write fluently in Russian, German, and English. He wrote two books in Yiddish ‚Äî The History of the Labor Movement in America and In the Light of Marxism. Political career In America, Kantorovitch was initially a \\"labor Zionist,\\" a member of the Poale-Zion movement. Highly regarded for his knowledge of political history and Marxist theory, in the 1920s Kantorovitch was employed as a teacher in the high school operated by the Workman's Circle (Yiddish: ◊ê÷∑◊®◊ë◊¢◊ò◊¢◊®÷æ◊®◊ô◊†◊í ‚Äî Arbeiter Ring), a Jewish fraternal organization based in New York City. Kantorovitch was also the director of the children's camps sponsored annually by the Workman's Circle organization. Haim Kantorovitch was the voice of the Militant faction in several influential pamphlets published during the Socialist Party's internal struggles of the 1930s. In 1926, Kantorovitch left the Poale-Zion movement to join the successor to the Jewish Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America ‚Äî the Jewish Socialist Verband.David Herreshoff, \\"American Socialist Quarterly/American Socialist Monthly/Socialist Review,\\" The American Radical Press, 1880-1960. Joseph R. Conklin, ed. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1974; v. 1, pp. 199-200. Kantorovitch was a frequent contributor to the publications of the Verband before becoming the editor of the official organ of the organization, a newspaper called Der Wecker. Kantorovitch continued to teach at various Workmen's Circle schools in Baltimore, Waterbury, Newark, and New York City. While in Baltimore he published his first English-language article, \\"The Rise and Decline of Neo-Communism,\\" a critical analysis of Communism and the Russian Revolution of 1917. The editor of the Modern Monthly, V.F. Calverton, was so impressed with Kantorovitch and his ideas that he was made an Associate Editor of the magazine, to which he frequently contributed. As the 1930s began, Kantorovitch moved his main activity to the English-speaking Socialist movement. He was an early and enthusiastic adherent to the Militant faction of the Socialist Party which emerged in 1930-31. At the end of 1931 Kantorovitch joined forces with two teachers at the Rand School of Social Science, Anna Bercowitz and David P. Berenberg, as a founder and co-editor of the American Socialist Quarterly, a magazine dedicated to socialist theory and in depth analysis of current questions of policy. The magazine would gain official status as the theoretical journal of the Socialist Party of America during its second year of publication.Herreshoff, \\"American Socialist Quarterly/American Socialist Monthly/Socialist Review,\\" v. 1, pp. 197-198. It was also approximately this same time that Kantorovitch first contracted tuberculosis, the disease which would later claim his life at the age of 46. Kantorovitch was the author of several political pamphlets advocating a move of the SPA towards a perspective of revolutionary socialism. Despite this perspective, Kantorovitch was consistently critical of the Communist Party (CPUSA), particularly hostile to the party's equation of social democrats with fascists and their activity building dual trade unions up through 1934 under the aegis of the Trade Union Unity League. When in 1935 the Militants made common cause with the \\"Progressives\\" around SP Presidential candidate Norman Thomas and launched a newspaper of their own called The Socialist Call in opposition to the organ of the Old Guard faction, The New Leader, Kantorovitch was a regular contributor. Although in ill health throughout his life with chronic tuberculosis, he continued to write for The Call and The American Socialist up to the time of his death. Death and legacy Haim Kantorovitch died on August 17, 1936, at a sanitarium operated by the Workman's Circle in Liberty, New York. His body was returned to New York City, where it lay in state for two days in the auditorium of the Young Circle League, located at 15 Union Square in New York City. A funeral was held on Friday, August 21 in that same location. A measured and intelligent man, Kantorovitch's death oddly parallel the October 1933 death from tuberculosis of his equivalent in the Old Guard faction, Morris Hillquit. Devoid of these two respected leaders, more acrimonious voices held sway for both factions in the Socialist Party and a party split soon followed with Old Guard leaders Louis Waldman and James Oneal exiting the party to form the Social Democratic Federation during the second half of 1936. Those remaining in the Socialist Party were rent with several other factional divisions and the membership of the party atrophied as a result of factional warfare and expulsions. Kantorovitch's colleague David Berenberg eulogized his co-worker in an article published shortly after his death: > \\"After the death of The Class Struggle [in 1919], an interim of ten years > followed during which the Socialist Party had no English publication other > than the daily and weekly propaganda papers. Few, apparently, felt the need > for something more substantial... For some years the writer cast about among > his friends in the party in the hope of finding those few whose enthusiasm > could be concretized into action. Then he found Anna Bercowitz, and through > her Haim Kantorovitch, who had been making the same search independently. * >  > > \\"For the last five years the [American Socialist Quarterly], and in the > last year the [American Socialist Monthly], were Haim Kantorovitch's life. > He gave to it the greater part of his time. He took its problems to the > sanitorium. In the long hours of his loneliness in Los Angeles and at > Liberty [NY] he pondered its future course. In his last days he summoned up > the remnants of his strength to write for it an article of pungent warning > to that party for which he was giving up his life.  * > > \\"He is gone now.

He had a tendency to > emphasize and subtly caricature the failings of his opponents. He was often > cynical and bitter. He was sometimes unjust. But these flaws in him merely > prove his humanity. We who have lost him would not have had him otherwise > than he was.\\"David P. Berenberg, \\"Haim Kantorovitch: A Tribute,\\" American > Socialist Monthly, vol. 5, no. 8 (December 1936), pp. 39-40. Haim Kantorovitch was survived by his wife, Jenny, and two daughters, Miriam (\\"Mary\\") and Malka. Footnotes Works Books and pamphlets * Di geshikh·π≠e fun der Ameri·∏≥aner arbey·π≠er ba·πøegung.

It was a popular model for Honda with 70,000 bikes sold in the UK alone.  Engine  The Super Dream was fitted with a four stroke, air-cooled, twin- cylinder engine. It had three valves per cylinder, two inlet and one exhaust, operated by a chain-driven overhead camshaft. Ignition was provided by capacitor discharge ignition (CDI). It had a 360¬∞ crank layout similar to many traditional British parallel twins, but with two balance shafts to reduce unwanted vibrations. It used a six-speed transmission and chain final drive. Fuelling was provided by twin Keihin carburettors.  CB250N  The CB250N Super Dream was a motorbike. It was a popular model in the United Kingdom due to the licensing laws at the time allowing learners to ride any motorbike with a capacity under 250cc. The CB250N was the most popular selling bike in the UK with over 17000 bikes sold in 1980 alone. Its popularity in the United Kingdom waned along with many in the 250cc class when in 1983, the maximum size of learner machines was reduced to .

Sarah, who was probably the youngest of their eight children, married firstly to Edmund Bridges, by whom she had six children, and secondly to Peter Cloyce (later Cloyes), a widower, by whom she had three more children. Salem Witch Trials On Sacrament Day in the spring of 1692, covenanted church member Sarah Cloyce (Sister #11) walked out of the Salem Village meetinghouse soon after the pastor Samuel Parris (Brother #1) announced that the Biblical text would be John Chapter 6 verse 70:, \\"Have not I chosen you twelve, and one is a devil.\\" She allowed the door to slam behind her. Her departure was interpreted by some as an overt act of protest and solidarity with her sister Rebecca Nurse (a covenanted member of another church near the harbor in Salem Town) who had recently been accused of witchcraft and committed to jail.Robert Calef p.92-3. Calef places this event on April 3, 1692, following the contemporaneously published account by Deodat Lawson, but according to both the Sermon Book of Parris and p. 10 of the church record book kept by Parris, March 27 was the date of the monthly Sacrament and also the relevant sermon. Sarah's husband and fellow covenanted church member Peter Cloyce (Brother #7) had also recently signed a statement of support for Rebecca Nurse (March 24). Soon Sarah Cloyce's name began to surface among the accusers including Abigail Williams, the 11-year-old niece of the Parris, and a teenager girl named Mary Walcott. An official complaint on behalf of the accusers was filed by Parris close neighbor's Jonathan Walcott and Nathaniel Ingersol (Brother #6). Ingersoll was also the senior deacon of the church (one of two, the other being Edward Putnam).Witches of Massachusetts - C-2, LegendsOfAmerica.com; accessed October 23, 2015 On April 11, 1692, Sarah Cloyce was interrogated in public but maintained her innocence. The first accuser questioned that day was an enslaved person owned by Parris and called John Indian.: \\"When did I hurt thee?\\" Sarah asked. \\"A great many times,\\" he said.\\"Oh you are a grievious liar,\\" Sarah responded. Abigail Williams was also questioned. Sarah was committed to jail and soon transferred to Boston prison until June 19 when she was transferred back to a jail in Ipswich. Another sister Mary Eastey was also accused and arrested. Sarah and her sisters repeatedly petitioned the court for an opportunity to present evidence which supported her innocence, and to exclude spectral evidence (testimony that the spirit of someone did something). Rebecca Nurse was executed in July and Mary Eastey was executed in September, so that of the three sisters, only Sarah Cloyce managed to survive. It is unknown why she survived and the other two did not. In September, there was an additional accusation against Sarah coming from Rebecca Towne, daughter of a late brother Edmund Towne. On September 9, 1692, an indictment was made out against Sarah, \\"for certain detestable arts called witchcraft and sorceries, wickedly, maliciously and feloniously hath used practiced and exercised... in, upon and against one Rebecca Towne of Topsfield...and also for sundry other acts of witchcraft.\\"Witches of Massachusetts - C-2, LegendsOfAmerica.com; accessed October 23, 2015 Last years After Governor William Phips dissolved the Court of Oyer and Terminer in October of 1692, a new Superior Court of Judicature was formed in December and given instructions to disregard all \\"spectral evidence\\" or testimony of the afflicted. In January 1693, this new court dismissed the charges against Sarah, the jurors marking the indictment \\"ignoramus\\", literally meaning \\"we do not know.\\" After paying her prison fees, she and her husband moved to Boston. Her husband immediately (February 8, 1693) began working with several other church members (\\"aggrieved brethren\\") including a son of Rebecca Nurse, in bringing action against Parris, hoping for a full apology, or failing that, to have him dismissed from their church.Salem Church Record-book, p. 15. \\"Peter Cloyce comes to me from Boston.\\" Parris includes other references to Cloyce no longer living near the Village and coming from Boston. In April 1695, the aggrieved brethren failed to get Parris ousted by a Council of neighboring churches moderated by Increase Mather, and including his prolific and witch-phobic son Cotton Mather.Robert Calef, p.61. Later that year, Peter Cloyce asked Parris for a dismission so that he and his wife could move their membership to a Church in Marlborough (West of Framingham).Church Record-book, p. 32 The other \\"aggrieved brethren\\" continued their fight and in 1697 were successful in bringing a civil case on behalf of the Village and Parris was removed from their church.Robert Calef, p. 64. Sarah spent the last years of her life trying to clear her sisters' names. After her death, her two sisters were eventually cleared of all charges. In 1706, Ann Putnam Jr. confessed to having falsely accused Sarah Cloyce and her sisters. And particularly, as I was a chief instrument of accusing Goodwife Nurse and her two sisters, I desire to lie in the dust, and to be humbled for it, in that I was a cause, with others, of so sad a calamity to them and their families; for which cause I desire to lie in the dust, and earnestly beg forgiveness of God, and from all those unto whom I have given just cause of sorrow and offense, whose relations were taken away or accused.Upham, Charles W.

Born in Canada, Harper was sent away by her father when she was seven to work as a domestic servant. She worked in that profession for 25 years before she saved enough money to start working full-time producing a hair tonic she invented.\\"Martha Matilda Harper\\" Women of the Hall. National Women's Hall of Fame. Retrieved 2010-02-10. The product, and the creation of special hair salons that utilized it, was successful. Harper began franchising the salon model to low-income women, and by its peak the company included more than 500 franchises and an entire line of hair care products. Early years Martha Matilda Harper was born in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. Her parents were Robert and Beadie Harper. She didn't receive a lot of formal education as a child. Harper's father sent her away at age seven to become a domestic servant for relatives in Orno, Ontario. She worked in that profession for 22 years before moving to the United States to work as a servant in Rochester, New York. Her last Canadian employer, a physician, imparted his knowledge of hair health to her, and bequeathed her his hair tonic formula when he died. She learned to respect scientific principles from the physician which benefitted her while making the hair tonic. While a servant, Harper developed her own hair tonic after becoming concerned that the hair products on the market did more harm than good. She saved enough money to begin producing the hair tonic full-time, and, upon leaving domestic service three years after her immigration to the United States, opened the first public hair salon in the region in order to help market it. Her salon opened in 1888 in Rochester using her life savings of $360. Company Harper's salon the Harper Method Hair Parlour, and many of her innovations underlie the modern concept of the hair salon. Before Harper, hairdressers used to make home visits. H She used her hair tonic on herself to advertise. Her floor-length hair also served as an effective marketing tool and appeared in many advertisements for her products. She hired former servants to staff her salon. In 1891, at the urging of Bertha Palmer of the Palmer House fame, Harper became the first to start modern retail franchising, allowing franchisees to open salons under the Harper name. Her first franchise was in Buffalo, New York. Palmer wanted Harper to open her unique hair salon in Chicago in 1893 in time for the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which Harper did. Each salon was owned by a woman; the first 100 shops only went to poor women like Harper. She trained the franchisees and inspect their salons to ensure quality. Emphasizing customer service and comfort, Harper invented reclining shampoo chairs, which became a common feature of salons worldwide. The salons offered scalp massage and child care, and they provided evening hours. The hair products her company produced were intended to be healthier than those widely available at the time and were made largely with natural products. Harper salons did not carry synthetic dyes or do chemical perms. Famous clientele At the height of its success, her company had 500 franchises and produced a full line of hair care and beauty products. Among the Harper customers were British royalty, Susan B. Anthony, Woodrow Wilson, Grace Coolidge, Joseph P. Kennedy, Rose Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, George Bernard Shaw, and Ladybird Johnson. Company Legacy Harper's own hair was the greatest advertisement for her products and services. This iconic image, and others in a similar pose, appeared in much of her early advertising. The Harper Method Inc. has operated under a variety of different owners. In June 1956, Robert McBain, Harper's husband, sold the enterprise to Earl Freese and Gerald Wunderlich who then made three different attempts to sell the business throughout the 1960s and 70s. In 1971, Robert Prentices, then manager of the Harper manufacturing centre in St. Catharine's, Ontario, purchased the factory assets along with Harper manufacturing and distribution rights, renaming the company Niagara Mist Marketing Ltd, also known as the Soap Factory. On March 10, 1972, other Harper Method Inc., assets were bought by PEJ Beauty Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wilfred Academy. At the time, PEJ was one of the largest operators of trade schools in America. According to Philip Jakeway, then President of the Wilfred Academy, he hoped to expand his operation by marketing the Harper products and shops. An agreement was reached whereby Prentice would supply Harper products to Jakeway for U.S. distribution. Jakeway was unsuccessful.\\"Plitt, Jane R., Martha Matilda Harper and the American Dream. 2000 The Harper Method Founder's Shop operated in Rochester, New York, as the country's oldest, and longest-running, beauty shop until the early 2000s. It was the last Harper shop to remain open. Death and legacy Martha died on August 3, 1950, one month short of her 93rd birthday, survived by her husband Robert MacBain, who later died on April 30, 1965, at the age of 83. At time of her death there were over 350 shops. Her gravesite is at Riverside Cemetery, Rochester, New York. Aside from business affairs, Harper also liked cooking, travel, and golf. She was a Christian Scientist and a member of First Church of Christ, Scientist, Rochester, New York.https://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/research/women-of-history-martha- matilda-harper/ She was a member of the Rochester Country Club and Oak Hill Country Club. She also studied at the University of Rochester for a few classes. In 2003, Harper was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the American Business Hall of Fame for her achievements in business. She is considered remarkable for helping other servants live the American dream by hiring them as staff and allowing them to become franchisees.

His prior professional experience includes time with the NBA Development League's Erie BayHawks, Rio Grande Valley Vipers and Fort Wayne Mad Ants, as well as time abroad with Hapoel Jerusalem, Mersin B√ºy√ºk≈üehir Belediyesi, Oita Heat Devils and Cairns Taipans. He played college basketball for the University of Illinois where he completed his senior season in 2010‚Äì11 and was the 2009‚Äì10 Big Ten assists champion (7.06) and the 2009‚Äì10 NCAA runner-up. He played high school basketball with Big Ten Conference foe Evan Turner on the St. Joseph High School (in Westchester) basketball team. He was a first-team All-state selection according to numerous publications. As a sophomore, he led the 2008‚Äì09 team in scoring average, and he was chosen as a third team 2008‚Äì09 All-Big Ten Conference player by both the coaches and the media. During his junior season, he led the big ten in assists per game. He holds the Illinois single-season assist/game (7.06) and single-game assists (16) records. Following the 2009‚Äì10 All-Big Ten Conference regular season, he was named a first-team All-conference selection by both the coaches and the media. He became the first Fighting Illini to average over seven assists per game over the course of a season during the 2009‚Äì10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. As a senior, he was a third team All-Big Ten selection for the 2010‚Äì11 Big Ten season. As a senior his assist numbers fell, but his shooting percentages rose. High school career He was part of a 2005 Chicago area sophomore class that was considered to be the best in the history of the state of Illinois. It included Derrick Rose and his St. Joseph's teammate Turner. Isiah Thomas is St. Joseph's most famous basketball alum, but McCamey was at the time mentioned as the potential next great St. Joseph's product. The class of 2007 was compared to the Chicago area class of 1979 that included Thomas, Terry Cummings, and Darrell Walker as well as the class of 1998 that included Quentin Richardson, Corey Maggette, Frank Williams, Bobby Simmons, Michael Wright. McCamey was considered the second best area prospect after Rose. As a junior, he and Turner attended 2005 Midnight Madness with the Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team. At the beginning of his junior season, Chicago Tribune named him to its annual top Chicago metropolitan area basketball players list, and it ranked St. Joseph number three in the area. The team went to the state sectional final before its season ended with a 75‚Äì72 sectional final loss to Proviso East High School. After his junior season, he was considered one of the top 25 prospects in the country in his class according to one scout, and he was given special mention by the Chicago Tribune and honorable mention by the Associated Press for all-state honors. During his senior season, his team was listed second to Rose's Simeon Career Academy in the preseason Tribune Chicago area high school basketball team rankings. That season, he was named to the second-team Associated Press 2006‚Äì07 Class AA all- state team, a day before Rose's Simeon eliminated Turner's St. Joseph in the Illinois Class AA supersectional. McCamey and Turner finished sixth and third to Rose in the Illinois Mr. Basketball voting, and the Chicago Tribune chose both of them as first team All-state selections along with Rose. He was also a first team selection by Chicago Sun-Times, Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette and Illinois Basketball Coaches Association. McCamey was ranked as the #10, #11 and #10 point guard in the nation as a high school senior by ESPN, Rivals.com, and Scout.com respectively. College career Freshman season When McCamey posted 31 points on February 7, 2008 against Indiana, it was the season high for the 2007-08 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team and the most by an Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball freshman in fourteen years. During the 2008 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament he made six three point shots in six attempts against Purdue, which set a Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament single-game record and tied the Illinois school single-game record for three point field goal percentage (most made with no misses). Sophomore season He was chosen as a third team 2008‚Äì09 All-Big Ten Conference player by both the Big Ten coaches and the Big Ten media. McCamey was also a National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Division I District 7 All‚ÄêDistrict second team choice. Since the Big Ten Conference was its own district, this is equivalent to being named second team All-Big Ten by the NABC. He led the 2008‚Äì09 Illinois Fighting Illini team in scoring average and was second in assists. On February 12, 2009, he scored the game-winning bank shot with 2.9 seconds remaining against Northwestern. Although he only ranked fourth in the conference in assists, he had the highest assist average in conference games. Junior season McCamey was named co-Big Ten Conference Player of the Week for February 8, 2010. On February 20, he recorded 16 assists, which is the fourth highest single-game total in Big Ten history. This total set an Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball single-game record. McCamey led the Big Ten in assists (7.06). He was also tenth in scoring and eighth in steals. His 254 assists in 36 games resulting in a 7.06 assist per game average eclipsed Deron Williams' 264 in 39 games (6.77 average) posted during the 2004‚Äì05 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Thus, McCamey took over the Fighting Illini single-season assist per game record. His total of 254 was the fourth highest in Big Ten history and only 20 shy of Mateen Cleaves' Big Ten single-season record of 274. Williams' 264 is the Fighting Illini record. McCamey's total of 525 after his junior season left him 291 short of Cleaves' career record of 816. Bruce Douglas holds the Fighting Illini record with a total of 765. At the end of the regular season, he was a first-team All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and the media. McCamey was selected by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association to the ten-man All-District V team covering college basketball players in the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. McCamey was selected to the 2010 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament team. He was recognized as an All-District first-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All‚ÄêAmerica teams. McCamey had entered his name for the 2010 NBA Draft, but did not hire an agent and withdrew his name prior to the May 8, 2010 deadline. Senior season He was a preseason first team all-conference selection by the Big Ten media for the 2010‚Äì11 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season. He was a preseason top 50 candidate for the Wooden Award. McCamey scored 30 points for the first time since his freshman season on December 8, 2010 against the Oakland Golden Grizzlies. On January 3, 2011, he was named co-Big Ten Player of the Week. On January 15, 2011 against Wisconsin, he made a career-high 17 free throws. In December he was named to the 67-man Bob Cousy Award watchlist, and he was named as one of 20 finalists in January. McCamey was selected to the Naismith Award Midseason Top 30 List. Following the 2010‚Äì11 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, he was a third team All-Big Ten selection by the coaches and the media. McCamey was selected by the United States Basketball Writers Association to its 2010‚Äì11 Men's All-District Team. He was among the final ten candidates for the Bob Cousy Award. As a senior, his assist average fell from 7.1 to 6.1 per game, but his three-point shot and free throw percentages rose from his prior years. He shot 45.1% versus 34.1% in three point shots the prior year, which had been a career best. Both his junior and senior seasons he took 164 attempts, but he made 74 as a senior versus just 56 as a junior. His free throw percentage also recovered a bit in his senior season moving to 72.4% from 70.7% but still below his sophomore effort of 76.4%.

These often include co-ops composed of businesses to achieve economies of scale (Retail cooperative), co-ops managed by those who work at the business (Worker cooperative), and bicycle co-ops owned and managed by the cyclists that use their services (Consumers' co-operative). To date, many bicycle co-ops have taken the form of community bike shops and cooperatives organized to give the Local bike shop national scale and buying power.  Bike cooperatives: community and consumer  As a Consumers' co- operative, community bike cooperatives are organized and owned by the cyclists who use them. Members often receive exclusive access and benefits to service and sales.  Shop time  Shop time is considered to be the use of the bike co-op's space and tools. Some bike co-ops charge users a set fee of between US$5 and US$20 per hour. Some bike co-ops will waive the fees for low-income users. Bike Pirates in Toronto is one example of a co-op which uses a pay what you want strategy. They request that each user make a donation. Co-ops with lower overhead costs are often more relaxed about cost recovery. For example, one co-op inside an Australian \\"community environment park\\" existed rent-free until recently. That co-op continued to charge just US$8 for a one-year membership, including unlimited shop time, even after it began paying rent.See and http://www.thebikeshed.org.au/WhatIsCERES.aspx .  Parts  The cost of new or used parts is usually added to the shop fee, but is typically substantially below retail prices. Some workshops stock new items such as brake pads, inner tubes, cables and housing, and bearings, for example. Parts may be sourced from public donations. Children's bikes are often donated when they are outgrown, and abandoned bikes are sometimes obtained through partnerships with police departments (evidence control), street cleaning firms, or from large institutions such as schools and universities.  Bike Cooperatives: retail  When a bicycle cooperatives takes the form of a Retail cooperative, it often takes the form of multiple businesses within the industry coming together to achieve economies of scale to compete with big-box brands, department stores and D2C \\"direct to consumer\\" bike sales.  Membership  Retailers' cooperatives are governed by democratic member control, which generally means one vote per member. For many retailer co-ops, however, it is difficult to achieve a democratic standard. Since the members are businesses rather than individuals, offering one vote per member will leave the larger member businesses underrepresented. If the number of votes is based on the size of the business, there is a risk of all smaller businesses within the cooperative being outvoted by a larger business. A democratic solution that many retailers' cooperatives employ is an increase in votes based on business size, up to a certain point, say five or ten votes. This way, there is a varying degree of representation for member businesses, but no one member can gain too much control.  Financing and economic goals  In order to lower costs, retailers' cooperatives establish central buying locations, providing them with the opportunity to purchase in bulk. Retailers' cooperatives also engage in group advertising and promotion, uniform stock merchandising, and private branding. The aim of the cooperative is to improve buying conditions for its members, which are retail businesses in this case. The incentive to remain in the cooperative is largely due to the profits that members gain.  Locations  An early bike co-op was the Fahrrad.Selbsthilfe.Werkstatt, founded in 1983 in a formerly squatted factory in Vienna, Austria. Another early co-op was \\"P'tit v√©lo dans la t√™te\\", founded in Grenoble, France, in 1994. In the United States, one of the earliest and longest continuous running co-op is BICAS in Tucson, Arizona, founded in 1994 (named changed to BICAS in 1996.) Later, some bike co-ops were founded in the western US. Examples include the Salt Lake City Bicycle Collective in Utah, founded 2002, and the Bike Kitchen, founded in 2003 in San Francisco. Bike co- ops can be found worldwide. The Bike Collective Network includes a regionally sorted list of hundreds of co-ops scattered across a few dozen countries. Bike co-ops are some of the most historical and long standing co-ops, for example, Edinburgh Bicycle Co-operative is the longest established worker co-operative in Scotland. A cooperative for American independent bicycle dealers was established in 2003 as \\"The Biking Solution\\". Now called The Bike Cooperative, this Retailers' cooperative has 300+ members across the country.

Early life Born in Bedford County, Virginia in 1940, at age 3 Shirl became dangerously ill with three illnesses at once: meningitis, polio, and cat scratch fever. \\"His sickness plunged him into a coma, from which he emerged after two weeks with paralyzed legs and damaged eyesight. When he was 7 or 8, Jennings was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive, untreatable disease of the retina that causes blindness. By the time he was 10, he could distinguish only light from dark. He attended the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind and later the YMCA School of Swedish Massage.\\" Treatment and return of sight In 1991, at the urging of his then-girlfriend, Barbara, Shirl visited ophthalmologist Dr. Trevor Woodhams to investigate opportunities to restore his sight. Woodhams suggested surgery to remove his dense cataracts and to determine the true underlying condition of his retinas. Woodhams believed that the removal of the cataracts would return some of Shirl's vision. The surgery did restore some of Shirl Jennings' vision. However, he was overwhelmed with visual sensory data and was unable to connect what he was seeing with his visual memory, which had all but disappeared. The family contacted Dr. Oliver Sacks, a famous neurologist known for his book Awakenings, who, along with other physicians, concluded that Shirl would need to relearn how to identify objects that he could feel and smell by using their visual cues. Shirl's extraordinary metamorphosis was featured in a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, \\"To See and Not See\\", by Dr. Sacks. Re-loss of sight In February 1992, Jennings contracted pneumonia, which led to respiratory failure that deprived his brain of oxygen. After recovering, while he could still see some colors and movement, his sight virtually vanished. Personal life Shirl reconnected with his future wife Barbara in 1988 after learning that Barbara, a woman he had dated 20 years earlier, had since divorced and moved back into the Atlanta, Georgia area. They were married in 1991. In 1996, Jennings began taking painting lessons and became a painter. His first solo art show was held in 2002 at the Center Street Arts Gallery in Conyers, Georgia. Film Shirl and Barbara Jennings became the inspiration for the characters of Virgil Adamson and Amy Benic in the movie At First Sight (1999) starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Val Kilmer spent time with Shirl Jennings in preparation for portraying him in the film. Death Shirl Jennings died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2003 at the age of 63.

It is listed on the Kelowna Heritage Register as a highly valued example of early residential pioneer settlement in the Okanagan Valley. The Home was constructed with adze-cut squared logs and dovetail joints on two-storey wood frame. William Thomas Small, a blind miller at The Lequime Mill built the original portion of the house in 1890 with three of his sons, Fred, Charles and William. The fieldstone fireplace in the parlour is carved with the year of construction '1890'. The house was sold in 1908 to James Hugh Baillie, who added a two-storey wood frame front in 1910. Baillie sold the house in 1918 to C. Graham, whose wife is reputed to have built a second fieldstone fireplace in the sitting room. In 1930, the house was bought by Arthur H. Raymer (1880‚Äì1956) and his wife Edith Small, the daughter of WT Small (1884‚Äì1951) who had grown up in the house. Raymer's father had been Kelowna's first mayor when the city was incorporated in 1905. Raymer's daughter, Hilda and her husband W. Sinclair-Thompson lived there with their son and daughter Terry Gilbert and Wendy Edith. The Mulberry tree on the property was brought to Kelowna on a wagon from Ontario by William Small. The heritage value of the building is characterised by the organic growth of more than a century from early pioneer vernacular architecture to modern additions while retaining the original portions, still easily defined and recognisable today. Small's wife was instrumental in founding the first school in the Mission Creek area in 1894. Six local families (Small, Casorso, Berard, Crawford, Dickson and Smith) gathered to refurbish the old Fred Gillard cabin under the guidance of William Small, the only carpenter in the party, to provide the first school in the area for the eighteen local children. They were taught by Fred Watson until 1900 for the sum of $720 per year (Okanagan Historical Society). References *City of Kelowna Heritage Building: W.T.

History The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture credits Henry Holderman, a member of the Cherokee tribe, as first envisioning Grand River as a source for hydroelectric power for the Cherokee Nation. Even prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907, Holderman began building political support for such a project. A feasibility study by the Army Corps of Engineers attracted favorable attention in the Oklahoma legislature, leading to creation of the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA), a state agency, in 1935. Construction began in 1938 on the Pensacola Dam on the Grand River (lower Neosho River) as a Works Progress Administration project. The dam was completed in March 1940, creating the lake behind it. Between 1941 and 1946, the U.S. government took control of Pensacola Dam to divert power to the war effort. Control was returned to the GRDA by the Congress and President Truman amid local celebration in August 1946. The second hydroelectric facility built by GRDA was the Markham Ferry project. In 1961, the Markham Ferry dam (since renamed as the Robert S. Kerr Dam) was begun downstream of Pensacola Dam on the Grand River. The lake it impounded was named Lake Hudson. The project was completed in 1964.U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. \\"Lake Hudson (Markham Ferry Reservoir).\\" Retrieved September 19, 2011. The powerhouse has four hydroelectric turbines, providing a total capacity of 114,000 kW. GRDA states that an average year can provide 211 million kWh. The Salina Pumped Storage Project constructed for GRDA during 1968 - 1971, created Lake W. R. Holway. It was designed to produce 260 MW of power during peak consumption periods. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.Wagman, David.

Then the hot turbine exhaust gas is cooled by boiling water to generate more steam, which drives a steam-powered generator and generates more electric power. The new generation unit was expected to be put in service in 2017, and has since been brought on-line.

He was notably committed to the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1951 to 1974 where he gave a total of 1,079 performances. Music critic Elizabeth Forbes stated that he had \\"a lyrical voice, a stylish technique and an aptitude for comedy.\\" In 1964 he joined the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music, where he taught singing and worked as an ensemble instructor until his death in Manhattan at the age of 83. Life and career Born in Budapest, Carelli was the son of Hungarian Jews. He studied singing at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music while simultaneously attending E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University where he earned a law degree. He pursued further studies in opera in Rome where he was a pupil of Beniamino Gigli for two years. Carelli made his stage debut in 1938 in Florence as Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me. He spent the next year performing in a variety of Italian theaters before moving to New York City in 1939. He spent the 1940s touring with various opera companies and performing as a recitalist and concert performer throughout North America. He was particularly admired for his work as a soloist in Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem, Gioachino Rossini's Stabat Mater, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly's Psalmus Hungaricus, and Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. In 1951, he sang the role of Dr. Caius for an NBC Radio broadcast of Verdi's Falstaff with conductor Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The performance was re-issued on CD by the RCA music label in 2010. In 1952 he was the tenor soloist for the United States premiere of Puccini's Messa di Gloria in Chicago. On 17 November 1951, Carelli made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Don Curzio in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro with Cesare Siepi in the title role, Nadine Conner as Susanna, John Brownlee as Count Almaviva, Victoria de los Angeles as Countess Almaviva, and Mildred Miller as Cherubino. He spent the next 23 years at the Met appearing in a variety of parts from supporting tenor buffo roles to leading roles. He portrayed a total of 56 different parts in 39 operas with some of his larger roles being Alfredo in La Traviata, the Captain in Wozzeck, Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, Count Elemer in Arabella, the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto, Ernesto in Don Pasquale, Mario Cavaradossi in Tosca, Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly, Rodolfo, Tamino in The Magic Flute, and Tonio in La fille du r√©giment. However, he was more often seen at the house in smaller to mid-sized roles such as Abb√© in Adriana Lecouvreur, Arturo Bucklaw in Lucia di Lammermoor, Gaston in La traviata, the Judge in Un ballo in maschera, Matteo Borsa in Rigoletto, Moser in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, Pong in Turandot, and Trin in La fanciulla del West. On 16 September 1966, he performed the role of the Soldier of Caesar in the world premiere of Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra. His final performance at the Met was on 22 January 1974 as one of the Jews in Richard Strauss's Salome with Grace Bumbry in the title role.

It consists of knowingly and willfully mailing or otherwise making \\"any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the president of the United States\\". This also includes presidential candidates and former presidents. The United States Secret Service investigates suspected violations of this law and monitors those who have a history of threatening the president. Threatening the president is considered a political offense. Immigrants who commit this crime can be deported. Because the offense consists of pure speech, the courts have issued rulings attempting to balance the government's interest in protecting the president with free speech rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. According to the book Stalking, Threatening, and Attacking Public Figures, \\"Hundreds of celebrity howlers threaten the president of the United States every year, sometimes because they disagree with his policies, but more often just because he is the president.\\" The prototype for Section 871 was the English Treason Act 1351, which made it a crime to \\"compass or imagine\\" the death of the King. Convictions under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 871 have been sustained for declaring that \\"President Wilson ought to be killed. It is a wonder some one has not done it already. If I had an opportunity, I would do it myself\\"; and for declaring that \\"Wilson is a wooden-headed son of a bitch. I wish Wilson was in hell, and if I had the power I would put him there.\\" In a later era, a conviction was sustained for displaying posters urging passersby to \\"hang [President] Roosevelt\\".) There has been some controversy among the federal appellate courts as to how the term \\"willfully\\" should be interpreted. Traditional legal interpretations of the term are reflected by Black's Law Dictionarys definition, which includes descriptions such as \\"malicious, done with evil intent, or with a bad motive or purpose,\\" but most courts have adopted a more easily proven standard. For instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that a threat was knowingly made if the maker comprehended the meaning of the words uttered by him. It was willingly made if, in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words, the maker voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution. According to the U.S. Attorney's Manual, \\"Of the individuals who come to the Secret Service's attention as creating a possible danger to one of their protectees, approximately 75 percent are mentally ill.\\" Frequency The first prosecutions under the statute, enacted in 1917, occurred during the highly charged, hyperpatriotic years of World War I, and the decisions handed down by the courts in these early cases reflected intolerance for any words demonstrating even a vague spirit of disloyalty. There was a relative moratorium on prosecutions under this statute until the World War II era. The number increased during the turbulent Vietnam War era. They have tended to fall when the country has not been directly embroiled in a national crisis situation. The number of reported threats rose from 2,400 in 1965 to 12,800 in 1969. According to Ronald Kessler, President George W. Bush received about 3,000 threats a year, while his successor Barack Obama received about four times that amount. This figure has been disputed by Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, who says that Obama received about as many threats as the previous two presidents. According to the U.S. Attorneys' Manual, \\"Media attention given to certain kinds of criminal activity seems to generate further criminal activity; this is especially true concerning presidential threats which is well documented by data previously supplied by the United States Secret Service. For example, in the six-month period following the March 30, 1981, attempt on the life of President Reagan, the average number of threats against protectees of the Secret Service increased by over 150 percent from a similar period during the prior year.\\" For this reason, the agency recommends considering the use of sealed affidavits to keep news of threats from leaking to the press. Incidents Convictions under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 871 have been sustained for declaring that \\"President Wilson ought to be killed. It is a wonder some one has not done it already. If I had an opportunity, I would do it myself.\\"; and for declaring that \\"Wilson is a wooden-headed son of a bitch. I wish Wilson was in hell, and if I had the power I would put him there.\\" In a later era, a conviction was sustained for displaying posters urging passersby to \\"hang [President Franklin D.] Roosevelt\\". In a 1971 interview, comedian Groucho Marx told Flash magazine, \\"I think the only hope this country has is Nixon‚Äôs assassination.\\" U.S. Attorney James L. Browning, Jr. opined, \\"It is one thing to say that 'I (or we) will kill Richard Nixon' when you are the leader of an organization which advocates killing people and overthrowing the Government; it is quite another to utter the words which are attributed to Mr. Marx, an alleged comedian.\\" alt=Cartoon of a man representing \\"politics\\" pointing a gun at George W. Bush's head. A storefront sign says \\"Iraq\\". In July 2003, the Los Angeles Times published a Sunday editorial cartoon by conservative Michael Ramirez that depicted a man pointing a gun at President Bush‚Äôs head; it was a takeoff on the 1969 Pulitzer Prize- winning photo by Eddie Adams that showed South Vietnamese National Police Chief Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner (Capt. Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√©m) at point-blank range. The cartoon prompted a visit from the Secret Service, but no charges were filed. In 2005, a teacher instructed her senior civics and economics class to take photographs to illustrate the rights contained in the United States Bill of Rights. One student \\"had taken a photo of George Bush out of a magazine and tacked the picture to a wall with a red thumb tack through his head. Then he made a thumb's-down sign with his own hand next to the president's picture, and he had a photo taken of that, and he pasted it on a poster.\\" A Wal-Mart photo department employee reported it to police, and the Secret Service investigated. No charges were filed. In 2007, Purdue University teaching assistant Vikram Buddhi was convicted of posting messages to Yahoo Finance criticizing the Iraq War and stating, \\"Call for the assassination of GW Bush\\" and \\"Rape and Kill Laura Bush.\\" The defense had argued that the defendant never explicitly threatened anyone. In September 2009 the Secret Service investigated Facebook polls that asked whether President Barack Obama should be assassinated. Some question has arisen as to how to handle Facebook groups such as \\"LETS KILL BUSH WITH SHOES\\" (a reference to the 2008 Muntadhar al-Zaidi shoe incident) which had 484 members as of September 2009; similar issues have arisen on MySpace. Tweets have come under Secret Service investigation, including ones that said \\"ASSASSINATION! America, we survived the Assassinations and Lincoln & Kennedy. We'll surely get over a bullet to Barrack Obama's head,\\" and \\"The next American with a Clear Shot should drop Obama like a bad habit. 4get Blacks or his claims to b[e] Black. Turn on Barack Obama.\\" In 2010, Johnny Logan Spencer Jr. was sentenced in Louisville, Kentucky, to 33 months in prison for posting a poem entitled \\"The Sniper\\" about the president's assassination on a white supremacist website. He apologized in court, saying that he was, as WHAS news put it, \\"upset about his mother's death and had fallen in with a white supremacist group that had helped him kick a drug habit.\\" In 2010, Brian Dean Miller was sentenced in Texas to 27 months in prison for posting to Craigslist: \\"People, the time has come for revolution. It is time for Obama to die. I am dedicating my life to the death of Obama and every employee of the federal government. As I promised in a previous post, if the health care reform bill passed I would become a terrorist. Today I become a terrorist.\\"Associated Press, \\"Man Who Threatened to Kill Obama Sentenced to Two Years in Prison\\", The Guardian, November 1, 2010 Later in 2010, a 77-year-old white man named Michael Stephen Bowden, who said that President Obama was not doing enough to help African Americans, was arrested after making murder-suicide threats against Obama. On July 19, 2011, the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of Walter Bagdasarian for making online threats against Obama. The court found that his speech urging Obama's assassination (\\"Re: Obama fk the niggar , he will have a 50 cal in the head soon\\" and \\"shoot the nig country fkd for another 4 years+, what nig has done ANYTHING right???? long term???? never in history, except sambos\\") was protected by the First Amendment. In 2017, Stephen Taubert, a 59-year-old Air Force veteran and resident of Syracuse, New York, called the office of Senator Al Franken and, in a rant full of racial slurs, said he was going to ‚Äúhang‚Äù former President Barack Obama. On April 29, 2019, United States District Court Judge Glenn T. Suddaby sentenced him to federal prison for 46 months for that crime and for making threats against the life Congresswoman Maxine Waters and her staff. His sentence came six weeks after a jury found him guilty of threatening to kill a former United States president, transmitting a threat in interstate commerce and making a threat to influence, impede or retaliate against a federal official. At his sentencing, Taubert said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the offensive language. That‚Äôs all it was. It does get me upset when I listen to the news and they attack [President Donald Trump]. He‚Äôs a good person and he‚Äôs done a lot for this country and the veterans.‚Äù After his sentencing, Grant C. Jaquith, the United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, said in a statement, ‚ÄúRacist threats to kill present and former public officials are not protected free speech, but serious crimes.\\" History The prototype for Section 871 was the British Treason Act 1351, which made it a crime to \\"compass or imagine\\" the death of the King.25 Edw. III, c. 2 (1351) The statute prohibiting threats against the president was enacted by Congress in 1917. The maximum fine it allowed was $1,000. The law was amended in 1994 to increase the maximum fine to $250,000. Among the justifications that have been given for the statute include arguments that threats against the president have a tendency to stimulate opposition to national policies, however wise, even in the most critical times; to incite the hostile and evil-minded to take the president's life; to add to the expense of the president's safeguarding; to be an affront to all loyal and right-thinking persons; to inflame their minds; to provoke resentment, disorder, and violence; and to disrupt presidential activity and movement.Rogers v. United States, . Justice Marshall (concurring): \\"Plainly, threats may be costly and dangerous to society in a variety of ways, even when their authors have no intention whatever of carrying them out. Like a threat to blow up a building, a serious threat on the President's life is enormously disruptive and involves substantial cost to the government. A threat made with no present intention of carrying it out may still restrict the President's movements and require a reaction from those charged with protecting the President.\\" It has also been argued that such threats are akin to treason and can be rightly denounced as a crime against the people as the sovereign power. Congressman Edwin Y. Webb noted, \\"That is one reason why we want this statute ‚Äì in order to decrease the possibility of actual assault by punishing threats to commit an assault ... A bad man can make a public threat, and put somebody else up to committing a crime against the Chief Executive, and that is where the harm comes. The man who makes the threat is not himself very dangerous, but he is liable to put devilment in the mind of some poor fellow who does try to harm him.\\"53 Cong.Rec. 9377-78 (1916) Prisoners are sometimes charged for threatening the president though they lack the ability to personally carry out such a threat. The courts have upheld such convictions, reasoning that actual ability to carry out the threat is not an element of the offense; prisoners are able to make true threats as they could carry out the threat by directing people on the outside to harm the president. Sometimes prisoners make such threats to manipulate the system; e.g., a case arose in which an inmate claiming to be \\"institutionalized\\" threatened the president in order to stay in prison; there was a case in which a state prisoner threatened the president because he wanted to go to a federal institution. Penalties Threatening the president of the United States is a federal felony under United States Code Title 18, Section 871. The offense is punishable by up to 5 years in prison, a $250,000 maximum fine, a $100 special assessment, and up to 3 years of supervised release. Internet restrictions such as a prohibition on access to email have been imposed on offenders who made their threats by computer. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines set a base offense level of 12 for sending threatening communication, but when a threat to the president is involved, a 6-level \\"official victim\\" enhancement applies. Moreover, \\"an upward departure may be warranted due to the potential disruption of the governmental function.\\" Further enhancements can apply if the offender evidenced an intent to carry out the threat (6-level enhancement); made more than two threats (2-level enhancement); caused substantial disruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services (4-level enhancement); or created a substantial risk of inciting others to harm federal officials (2-level enhancement). Since each 6-level increase approximately doubles the Guidelines sentencing range, it is not particularly rare for an offender who threatens the president to receive a sentence at or near the statutory maximum, especially if he/she has a criminal history and/or does not qualify for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. There is a 4-level decrease available for a threat involving a \\"single instance evidencing little or no deliberation\\", which would usually apply to spur-of-the-moment verbal threats. The maximum penalty for threatening a United States judge or a Federal law enforcement officer is 10 years imprisonment -- double the maximum penalty for threatening the president. Interpretation There has been some controversy among the federal appellate courts as to how the term \\"willfully\\" should be interpreted. Traditional legal interpretations of the term are reflected by Black's Law Dictionarys definition, which includes descriptions such as \\"malicious, done with evil intent, or with a bad motive or purpose.\\" In U.S. v. Patillo, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a threat to the president could lead to a verdict of guilty \\"only if made with the present intention to do injury to the president\\". Specifically, the court opined that \\"The word [willfully] often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose...We believe that a 'bad purpose' assumes even more than its usual importance in a criminal prosecution based upon the bare utterance of words.\\" Most of the other circuits have held that it is not necessary that the threat be intended to be communicated to the president or that it have tendency to influence his action. The legislative history, which contains debate over a rejected amendment that would have eliminated the words \\"knowingly and willfully\\" from the statute, reflects that the word \\"willfully\\" was included in order to avoid criminalizing behavior carried out with innocent intent (e.g. mailing to a friend, for informational purposes, a newspaper article containing a threat to the president). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that a threat was knowingly made if the maker comprehended the meaning of the words uttered by him. It was willingly made, if in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words, the maker voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution. Watts v. United States In the case of Watts v. United States 394 U.S. 705 (1969). , the United States Supreme Court ruled that mere political hyperbole must be distinguished from true threats. At a DuBois Club public rally on the Washington Monument grounds, a member of the assembled group suggested that the young people present should get more education before expressing their views. The defendant, an 18-year-old, replied: > They always holler at us to get an education. And now I have already > received my draft classification as 1-A and I have got to report for my > physical this Monday coming. I am not going. If they ever make me carry a > rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L. B. J. According to court testimony, the defendant in speaking made a gesture of sighting down the barrel of a rifle. The audience responded with laughter and applause, which the Court of Appeals would later view as potentially ominous: > [I]t has not been unknown for laughter and applause to have sinister > implications for the safety of others. History records that applause and > laughter frequently greeted Hitler's predictions of the future of the German > Jews. Even earlier, the Roman holidays celebrated in the Colosseum often > were punctuated by cheers and laughter when the Emperor gestured thumbs down > on a fallen gladiator. The boy was arrested and found to be in possession of cannabis, but a Court of General Sessions Judge suppressed the cannabis because he found that there had been no probable cause for the Secret Service agents to believe the defendant's words constituted a threat to the president. This did not prevent a federal court from convicting him for threatening the president. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed his conviction, but the Supreme Court reversed, stating, \\"We agree with petitioner that his only offense here was 'a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the president.' Taken in context, and regarding the expressly conditional nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners, we do not see how it could be interpreted otherwise.\\" In a concurring opinion, William O. Douglas noted, \\"The Alien and Sedition Laws constituted one of our sorriest chapters; and I had thought we had done with them forever ... Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution.\\" Other cases Courts have held that a person is guilty of the offense if certain criteria are met. Specifically, the person must intentionally make a threat in a context, and under such circumstances, that a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by persons hearing or reading it as a serious expression of an intention to harm the president. The statement must also not be the result of mistake, duress or coercion. A true threat is a serious threat and not words uttered as a mere political argument, idle talk, or jest. The standard definition of a true threat does not require actual subjective intent to carry out the threat. A defendant's statement that if they got the chance they would harm the president is a threat; merely because a threat has been conditional upon the ability of the defendant to carry it out does not render it any less of a threat. It has been ruled that taken together, envelopes containing ambiguous messages, white powder, and cigarette butts that were mailed to the president after the 9/11 anthrax outbreaks conveyed a threatening message. The sending of non-toxic white powder alone to the president has been deemed to be a threat. A broad statement that the president must \\"see truth\\" and \\"uphold Constitution\\" or else the letter writer will put a bullet in his head count as not expressly conditional as it does not indicate what events or circumstances will prevent the threat from being carried out. However, the statement \\"if I got hold of President Wilson, I would shoot him\\" was not an indictable offense because the conditional threat was ambiguous as to whether it was an expression of present or past intent. The posting of a paper in a public place with a statement that it would be an acceptable sacrifice to God to kill an unjust president was ruled not to be in violation of the statute. The statute does not penalize imagining, wishing, or hoping that the act of killing the president will be committed by someone else. Conversely, the mailing of letters containing the words \\"kill Reagan\\" and depicting the president's bleeding head impaled on a stake was considered a serious threat. An oral threat against the president unheard by anyone does not constitute a threat denounced by statute. Since other statutes make it a crime to assault or to attempt to kill the president, some question has arisen as to whether it is necessary to have a statute banning threats. As the Georgetown Law Journal notes, \\"It can be argued that the punishment of an attempt against the life of the president is not sufficient; by the time all the elements of an attempt have come into existence the risk to the president becomes too great. On the other hand, the punishment of conduct short of an attempt runs the risk of violating the established principle that intent alone is not punishable ... While ordinarily mere preparation to commit an offense is not punishable, an exception may perhaps be justified by the seriousness of the consequences of an executed threat on the president's life.\\"Comment, Threatening the President: Protected Dissenter or Potential Assassin, 57 Geo. L.J. 553 (1969) Psychiatric matters According to the U.S. Attorney's Manual, \\"Of the individuals who come to the Secret Service's attention as creating a possible danger to one of their protectees, approximately 75 percent are mentally ill.\\" The Secret Service notes, \\"These are probably Secret Service's most serious cases because it must be determined whether the person making the threat really wants to hurt [Secret Service protectees] or whether they may have some medical problems of their own, for which they need help.\\" It is not uncommon for judges to order psychological evaluations of defendants charged under this statute in accordance with United States federal laws governing offenders with mental diseases or defects. Psychiatrists divide people who threaten the president into three classes: Class 1 includes persons who have expressed overt threatening statements but have made no overt action, Class 2 comprises individuals who have a history of assaultive behaviors toward authority figures, and Class 3 includes person who are considered dangerous and typically have been prosecuted under Section 871. Dilemmas related to patient confidentiality sometimes arise when a mentally ill subject makes a threat against the president. The termination of nurse Linda Portnoy was upheld after she reported such a statement to the Secret Service. The court noted that the patient was restrained and unable to act on his threats, so he was not an immediate safety risk. It also considered the patient's psychiatrist, not Portnoy, the appropriate person to assess the gravity of his threats. In a study found that in those who threaten the president, the primary differentiating variable related to lethality was \\"opportunity and happenstance\\". Conversely, a defendant's writings in his anger management workbook threatening to kill the president upon the defendant's release from the penitentiary were ruled to have fallen within the dangerous patient exception to psychotherapist-patient privilege. Federal law provides that the director of the facility in which a person is hospitalized due to being found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty only by reason of insanity of a Section 871 violation shall prepare annual or semiannual reports concerning the mental condition of the person and containing recommendations about the need for his continued hospitalization; a copy of the reports shall be submitted to the Director of the United States Secret Service to assist it in carrying out its protective duties. The Ninth Circuit ruled that it is constitutional to hold a presidential threatener beyond Section 871's prescribed five-year statutory maximum if he is found to be dangerous and mentally ill. It is possible under federal law to hold some presidential threateners indefinitely.

The group also includes relatives of victims of earlier human rights abuses, including mass executions during the 1980s. The principal demand of the Mourning Mothers is government accountability for the deaths, arrests, and disappearances of their children. The mothers meet on Saturdays in Laleh Park in Tehran, and are often chased by the police and arrested. The Mourning Mothers have called for the revocation of death sentences for political prisoners, the release of prisoners of conscience, and trials of \\"those who were responsible for and who ordered their children's murders.\\" In 2009, Iranian Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi urged women around the world to show solidarity with the Mourning Mothers by wearing black and meeting in neighborhood parks on Saturdays from 7 to 8 pm. Arrests and imprisonment On January 9, 2010, more than thirty Mourning Mothers were arrested by security agents at Laleh Park. According to eyewitnesses, the mothers were attacked by over 100 police and plainclothes agents, who violently forced the mothers into police vans. These arrests were widely condemned by human rights organizations. The mothers were released from prison on January 14, 2010. On December 27, 2011, group member Zhila Karamzadeh- Makvandi was arrested and sentenced to two years in Evin Prison for \\"founding an illegal organization\\" and \\"acting against state security\\".

He also served in the Utah State Senate and as chairman of the Utah Democratic Party. Bennion was born in Taylorsville, Utah Territory. At age six he moved with his parents to present-day West Point, Nevada a small community in the Muddy River Valley where they had been called to settle by the LDS Church. For five years they were involved in raising sheep and cattle at that location, and then when Bennion was about 13 he moved back to Taylorsville with the rest of his family. At age fourteen he was involved in a major cattle run from Nevada to Rush Valley, Utah along with his father. In 1876 the Bennion family moved to Vernon in Tooele County, Utah. In 1878 Bennion began studying at the University of Deseret (now the University of Utah) from which he received a certificate as a teacher after one year. However, for the next seven years Bennion was involved in sheep herding and farming in Vernon. He later worked for George M. Cannon who was the Salt Lake County recorder. After leaving employment there in 1893 Bennion married Vilate Kimball Nebeker, the daughter of George Nebeker. Bennion then moved to Vernal, Utah in 1893, where his brother Samuel R. Bennion was the stake president. He served as manager of the Ashley Cooperative Mercantile Institution in Vernal and was involved in organizing the Bank of Vernal. Bennion also served as a member of the Board of Tuustees of the town of Vernal and town clerk. Vernal then became a city and Bennion was elected a member of the city council. He also held the position of postmaster in Vernal. In the LDS Church Bennion served in the YMMIA presidency in the Vernal Ward and then as a counselor in the bishopric of that ward. In 1898 Bennion was elected to the State Senate, representing Uintah County, Utah, Grand County, Utah, San Juan County, Utah, Emery County, Utah and Carbon County, Utah. Since Daggett County, Utah did not yet exist and was still in the boundaries of Uintah County it was also part of Bennion's district. Bennion was re-elected to the state senate in 1902 and so continued in that position through the end of 1906. In 1906 Bennion became a member of the Uintah stake (based in Vernal) high council. Shortly after that he became a counselor in the Uintah Stake presidency. Shortly after that in 1908 in business affairs Bennion began to work full-time as a rancher. However, in 1909 Governor William Spry appointed Bennion to the Utah State Board of equalization. For the next eight years he served in either that position or as a member of the Utah Commission on Taxation and Revenue. With his new appointment in 1909 Bennion moved to Salt Lake City and was released from the Uintah Stake presidency and called as a member of the Salt Lake Stake High Council. From 1914 to 1916 Bennion served as stake clerk of the Duchesne Stake, based in Roosevelt, Utah. In 1916 Bennion was elected Secretary of State of Utah. He then was involved with irrigation boards and worked with Joseph R. Murdock to found the Wasatch Livestock Loan Company. In 1924 Bennion became head of the Utah Democratic Party and in that position successfully oversaw the election of George H. Dern as governor. From 1925 to 1933 Bennion was Utah Commissioner of Agriculture. From 1923 to 1929 Bennion also served as a counselor in the Salt Lake Stake presidency. Bennion and his wife Vilate had five daughters, four of whom lived to adulthood.

It amounts to a sentence reduction of about 35%. The 3-level reduction is only available to defendants with an offense level of 16 or greater, and it requires a timely guilty plea. Federal plea agreements usually include a stipulation that the government will support granting the defendant the acceptance of responsibility reduction. The guideline states, in reference to the 2-level reduction: Because the vast majority of federal criminal cases are settled by plea bargains, the application of this reduction is extremely common and has a great impact on the number of prisoner-years served altogether throughout the U.S. justice system. Research indicates that the offender's race/ethnicity, controlling for offender and offense characteristics, has a significant influence on the sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that \\"lack of remorse\\" and \\"acceptance of responsibility\\" can be separate factors and that a district court may consider each independently of the other. The concept of remorse, within the framework of federal sentencing law, has been described as posing epistemological problems. Some courts use the \\"acceptance of responsibility\\" guideline to impose harsher punishments on defendants whose lawyers engage in aggressive forms of representation, such as making factually or legally dubious arguments, seeking tactical delays, or misleading the court. Whether or not a defendant has accepted responsibility for his crime is a factual determination to which most circuits have decided to apply the \\"clearly erroneous\\" standard of review. The guideline commentary states, \\"The reduction of offense level provided by this section recognizes legitimate societal interests. For several reasons, a defendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense by taking, in a timely fashion, the actions listed above (or some equivalent action) is appropriately given a lower offense level than a defendant who has not demonstrated acceptance of responsibility.\\" However, the specific \\"several reasons\\" are not provided. A defendant cannot be denied the reduction in sentence provided by ¬ß 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines because he refused to make self-incriminating statements relating to conduct included in counts to which he had not pleaded guilty and which were dismissed as part of a plea agreement.US v.

She leads the Microbial Research initiative within the Innovative Genomics Institute, is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and has a position at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Some of her most noted work includes publications on the structure and functioning of microbial communities and the nature, properties and reactivity (especially crystal growth) of nanomaterials. Early life and education Banfield at the Franklin Award Ceremony with her husband Peregrine (Perry) Smith in April 2011 Banfield was educated at the Australian National University where she completed her bachelor's and master's degrees (1978‚Äì1985) both examining granite weathering. She attributes her initial interest in geomicrobiology to Dr Tony Eggleton who drew her attention to processes at the earth's surface, mineral weathering and the regolith. Banfield graduated with a PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences from Johns Hopkins University for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies of metamorphic reactions supervised by David R. Veblen. Career and research Banfield is an earth scientist who studies the structure, functioning and diversity of microbial communities in natural environments and the human microbiome. Her laboratory and collaborators pioneered the reconstruction of genomes from natural ecosystems and community metaproteomic analyses. Through genomics, her group has provided insights into previously unknown and little known bacterial and archaeal lineages, leading to a new rendition of the Tree of Life. She has conducted extensive research on natural and synthetic nanomaterials, exploring the impacts of particle size on their structure, properties and reactivity. Her lab described the oriented attachment-based mechanism for growth of nanoparticles and its implications for development of defect microstructures. She has also studied microorganism- mineral interactions, including those that lead to production of nanomaterials. Banfield was a Fulbright Student in Medicine from the Australian National University to Johns Hopkins University in 1988, and a Mac Arthur Fellow in 1999. She has been a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1990 to 2001 and The University of Tokyo (1996‚Äì1998). Since 2001, she has been a researcher and professor at the University of California Berkeley. Here she heads their geomicrobiology program and works as a researcher under the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Her current research spans from field sites in Northern California to Australia and from subjects including astrobiology and genomics/geosciences. The Banfield lab studies microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems, including soils, sediments and groundwater, as well as the human environment (human microbiome and the built environment). Topics of current interest include the process of microbial colonization, organism interdependencies, diversity and microbial evolution. This research includes consideration of microbial impacts on mineral dissolution and precipitation and the structure and reactivity of finely particulate nanomaterials and clays that are abundant and important in earth's near-surface environments. Research exploring microbial diversity and metabolic capacities draws heavily on genome-resolved metagenomic methods coupled to tools that provide insight into function in situ (proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics). In fact, the Banfield lab led the first research that achieved reconstruction of draft genomes from shotgun sequence information (metagenomics, also described as community genomics) as well as the first community (meta)proteomic studies of microbial communities (2004 and 2005, respectively). The combined approaches have been used to investigate many aspects of ecosystem function, including microbial impacts on the carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, iron and hydrogen cycles. Emphasis is placed on analysis of reconstructed genomes because these provide detailed information about genetic potential, with strain resolution, without reliance on laboratory isolation of the organisms or the need for sequences from related (but potentially metabolically distinct) species. Studies conducted in an underground research facility in Japan are relevant for predicting the implications of microbial activity for the safety of geological disposal of high-level radionuclide wastes. Research conducted at Crystal Geyser (Green River, Utah) probes the potential for subsurface microbial communities to take up CO2 that could leak from CO2 sequestration sites, should such storage be pursued to limit CO2 contamination of the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels. Research on the sediments and aquifer fluids at a site adjacent to the Colorado River near Rifle, Colorado, targets knowledge gaps related to how subsurface microbial communities are structured, respond to changes in environmental conditions, and influence the chemical form and reactivity of contaminants such as vanadium, selenium, arsenic and uranium. Important outcomes of this work include the first descriptions of hundreds of little known or previously unknown organisms, including those from massive groups of uncultivated bacteria (now referred to as the Candidate Phyla Radiation) and archaea. In a study that involves collaboration with the Harrison Lab at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, the group is investigating microbial communities in bioreactors that breakdown thiocyanate, a toxic waste product of gold mining. The objective of this work is to develop understanding of how these communities function under different SCN loadings, and to provide clues as to the how to improve the effectiveness of biological decontamination of mining wastewater so that it can be recycled back into the mining process. Research conducted at the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in northern California is comparing the membership and functioning of microbial communities involved in cycling of carbon and other compounds in soils and the vadose zone. Of particular interest is the response of soil consortia to the first fall rain event(s), when massive pulses of carbon and nitrogen compounds propagate through the system. Research approaches developed initially to study mining- related sites (acid mine drainage-associated ecosystems) has been adapted to investigate the human microbiome. Of particular interest has been the process of colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of premature infants during their critical first weeks of life. In parallel, the lab is studying the sources of microbes that colonize the gut and the flow of microbes between the infant and the surrounding environment. A 2017 study demonstrated low level of overlap in the strain membership of microbial communities in different infants hospitalized in the same neonatal intensive care unit at the same time. The group continues to study nanomaterials, including the process of oriented attachment-based crystal growth that they first described in detail in the mid- to late 1990s. Also of current interest is the impact of salinity on nucleation and growth of iron oxyhydroxides and on the structure of smectite clay materials.

General information Dendraster excentricus is an irregular echinoid that is flattened and burrows into the sand, unlike the regular echinoids, or sea urchins. It can be found living in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Baja California.The range for Dendraster excentricus is larger and includes the range of the other two extant species of Dendraster: D. vizcainoensis and D. terminalis. The flower pattern in this species is off- center, giving it the species name excentricus. Its test (skeleton) is compared to that of a sea urchin below. Description They are colored gray, brown, black or shades of purple. Their size is variable, averaging 76 mm with the world's largest found measuring 120 mm wide.# Sand dollar from Olympia beach may break a record HeraldNet, August 21, 2013 They have a dome shaped carapace varying in height to about 10 mm with a circular body or test. Their body is covered with fine, spiny tube-like feet with cilia, and like other echinoderms they have five-fold radial symmetry. The mouth, anus, and food grooves are on the lower (oral) surface and the aboral surface has a petalidium, or petal shaped structure, with tube feet. Dead individuals have a gray/white test, or skeleton, which is often found washed up on beaches. It has a water-vascular system from the internal cavity or coelom that connect with tube feet. The tube feet are arranged in five paired rows and are found on the ambulacra‚Äîthe five radial areas on the undersurface of the animal, and are used for locomotion, feeding, and respiration. Spines are generally club shaped in adults, and less so in juveniles. The five ambulacral rows alternate with five interambulacral areas, where calcareous plates extend into the test. At the center on the aboral side is the madreporite‚Äîa perforated platelike structure, and on the interambulacra are the four tiny genital pores. Radiating out from the genital pores are the five flower petals, which represents the ambulacral radii. The mouth is in the center on the bottom side, with the anus toward the edge.

It can live at a depth of 40 to 90 meters, but usually is found in more shallow areas. Sand dollars are usually crowded together over an area half buried in the sand. As many as 625 sand dollars can live in one square yard (0.85 sq m). It is the only sand dollar found in Oregon and Washington. It has been found on Burfoot Beach in the South Puget sound. Behavior and feeding Like its cousins, dendraster is a suspension feeder which feeds on crustacean larvae, small copepods, diatoms, plankton, and detritus. Adult sand dollars move mainly by waving their spines, while juveniles use their tube feet. The tube feet along the petalidium are larger and are used for respiration while tube feet elsewhere on the body are smaller and are used for feeding and locomotion. They frequently move around if they are lying flat. When feeding they usually lay at an angle with their anterior end buried and catch small prey and algae with its pedicellariae, tube feet, and spines and pass them to the mouth. Their mouth includes a small Aristotle's lantern structure found in most Echinoids. In high currents adults grow heavier skeletons while juveniles swallow heavy sand grains to keep from being swept away. They will bury themselves when they are being preyed on. Hydrofoil design This particular species of sand dollar is known for its curious behavior: When exposed to a steady flow of water, they gather in groups, forming aligned rows in the sand, while digging their front edge in and raising their back edge into the flow of water, lined up so it passes from right to left across their bodies. Because the shape of a sand dollar is a hydrofoil, this draws particles of food closer in to their mouths during feeding, a benefit enhanced by the alignment of many individuals together into a communal feeding group. Reproduction Sexes are separate, with no noticeable differences in external features of the two sexes. Reproduction is sexual and D. excentricus reaches sexual maturity between 1 and 4 years of age, spawning in late spring and early summer. Fertilization is external, the female Dendraster discharges the eggs through her gonopores and they are fertilized by the male, who protrudes his genital papilla from his body wall. This is one reason they are believed to live in large groups and tend to release gametes at the same time into the water column. Eggs are pale orange, and are covered by a thick jelly coat which keeps adults from eating the eggs. Development The first larval stage is called a prism. After this stage the embryo will develop two arms transforming itself into an echinopluteus larva. This is followed by the development of arms, until it reaches 8 arms all together. After this the larva develops an echinus or juvenile rudiment, which will become the juvenile. The nektonic larvae are pelagic and travel away from the parent group with the current. The developed larvae will receive a chemical cue from adults to settle down into a bed of sand dollars and begin to undergo metamorphosis to their adult sand dollar form. As adults they are benthos and stay on the sandy bottom. Lifespan and predation Predators include the seastar Pisaster brevispinus and the starry flounder Platichthys stellatus as well as crabs and sea gulls. They are sometimes settled on by a small barnacle, Paraconcavus pacificus. Large storms or high temperatures and desiccation can cause mass mortality if low tide coincides with a hot midday and the animals are exposed to air for just 2 to 3 hours or washed up and buried in the sand. Old age is thought to be the main cause of death of Dendraster excentricus. They may live up to 13 years and can be aged by counting growth rings on the plates of the test or by counting the pores in a petal of the petalidium. Conservation The habitat they live in on the sandy seafloor is sometimes damaged by bottom trawling, causing harm to many organisms. Ocean acidification and sea surface warming also harm populations of sand dollars.

In artillery, caliber or calibredifference in British English and American English spelling is the internal diameter of a gun barrel, or by extension a relative measure of the length. Rifled barrels Rifled barrels introduce ambiguity to measurement of caliber. A rifled bore consists of alternating grooves and lands. The distance across the bore from groove to groove is greater than the distance from land to land. Projectiles fired from rifled barrels must be of the full groove to groove diameter to be effectively rotated by the rifling, but the caliber has sometimes been specified as the land to land diameter before rifling grooves were cut. The depth of rifling grooves (and the consequent ambiguity) increases in larger calibers. Steel artillery projectiles may have a forward bourrelet section machined to a diameter slightly smaller than the original land to land dimension of the barrel and a copper driving band somewhat larger than the groove to groove diameter to effectively seal the bore as it becomes enlarged by erosion during prolonged firing. United States Navy guns typically used rifling depth between one-half and one percent of caliber. Projectile bourrelet diameter specification was less than land to land diameter with a minus manufacturing tolerance so average clearance was about . Driving band diameter was groove to groove diameter plus . Barrel length The length of the barrel (especially for larger guns) is often quoted in calibers. For example, US Naval Rifles or larger. The effective length of the barrel (from breech to muzzle) is divided by the barrel diameter to give a dimensionless quantity. As an example, the main guns of the s can be referred to as 16\\"/50 caliber. They are 16 inches in diameter and the barrel is 800 inches long (16 √ó 50 = 800). This is also sometimes indicated using the prefix /L; so for example, the most common gun for the Panzer V tank is described as a \\"75 mm /L70,\\" meaning a barrel with an internal bore of 75 mm, and 5,250 mm long (17 ft 2.69 in). The bore to barrel length ratio is called caliber in naval gunnery, but is called length in army artillery. Before World War II, the US Navy used 5\\"/51 caliber (5\\"/L51) as surface-to-surface guns and 5\\"/25 caliber (5\\"/L25) as surface to air guns. By the end of World War II, the dual purpose 5\\"/38 caliber (5\\"/L38) was standard naval armament against surface and air targets. All three had a bore diameter of 5 inches (not 5.51 or 5.25 or 5.38 as often misread). Naval rifles, although constructed and manufactured in roughly the same manners as land based artillery, were built to much more stringent and studious standards than land based weapons, and for good reason. At sea, a weapon had to perform, without fail. There was no ready replacement, nor one that could be readily supplied. Over time, the terms of pound (weight of shell) and bore (the actual bore of the weapon) became confused and blurred. Eventually, when the technology existed, the bore (in inches or millimetres) came to be the standard measure. For naval rifles, the initial change was to actual bore, thus facilitating the manufacture of standard projectiles. They then began to measure the effective length (and therefore range) of the weapon in calibers. These are a measure of the standardized bore of the barrel versus the rifled bore of the barrel. In other words, a 12/45 is 12\\"√ó45= the length of the rifled bore of that gun in inches. This explains the differences in both penetration and long range performance of various naval rifles over the years. In addition to the possible improvements in overall performance (i.e. muzzle velocity and striking force), the increase in barrel length also allowed, in some circumstances, an increase in projectile size as well. For example, the American 14/45, as introduced in the s, fired a 1250 lb. projectile. Later improvements to the design, lengthening the rifle itself and also altering the breech, allowed a 1400 lb. projectile and, overall, a greater barrel life. Again we see this pattern with the US 16\\" guns. The initial design was 45 calibers in length and fired a 2200 lb. shell. The later re-design to 50 calibre not only allowed a higher velocity but also a heavier 2700 lb. shell, which ultimately came to be accepted as the greatest naval shell ever deployed in combat. Early gun barrels were short and thick, typically no more than 26 calibers, as the gunpowder propellant they used burned very quickly and violently, and hence its acceleration time was short. Slower-burning \\"brown powder\\" formulations of gunpowder allowed gun barrel length to increase slightly in the 1880s but enormous quantities of brown powder were required. New slower-burning \\"smokeless powder\\" propellants available from the 1880s onwards such as Poudre B, cordite and nitrocellulose allowed a gentler prolonged acceleration, hence gun barrels were made progressively longer and thinner. The new formulations were far more powerful propellants than gunpowder and far less was needed by weight as they transformed almost entirely to gasses when burned. Muzzle velocity became limited only by the length of barrel that was feasible, both in terms of the construction methods of the day and in terms of any practical constraints imposed by the gun's manner of use. The practical effect of long barrels for modern guns is that the projectile spends more time in the barrel before it exits, and hence more time is available for expanding gas from the controlled burning of the propellant charge to smoothly accelerate the projectile, bringing about a higher velocity without placing undue strain on the gun. In internal ballistics terms, if the base of a projectile is thought of as a piston propelled by the expanding gas, then as barrel length increases the volume swept by the piston also increases, and hence the amount of energy that can be extracted from the gas's burning increases. A longer barrel allows more propellant to be used: the propellant is all burned fairly early in the projectile's journey along the barrel, except in the very common instance where combustion is still occurring as the projectile leaves the muzzle and a visible muzzle \\"flash\\" is produced. The projectile continues to accelerate as long as the pressure behind it is sufficient to overcome bore friction. The excess energy will continue to accelerate the projectile until it exits the muzzle. If the pressure behind the projectile drops sufficiently before the projectile leaves the bore, the projectile can and will slow while still within the barrel, despite residual bore pressure behind the projectile. A light charge with insufficient pressure to expel the projectile will result in a \\"squib\\", or projectile lodged in the bore. Canadian Army. B-GL-306-006/FP-001, 1992-06-01 This pressure is reduced by the increasing barrel volume the gas has to fill, and in order to achieve maximum muzzle velocity with the shortest barrel length, the projectile should exit the barrel as the gas pressure reduces to a small fraction of the maximum, although unlike chamber maximum chamber pressure, the small fraction desired is impossible to measure. In modern guns, increased muzzle velocities can be produced by altering powder composition and/or using duplex charges containing two different powders in order to extend the \\"pressure curve\\" farther down the bore. By exposing the projectile base to a given pressure for a longer length of time, velocity can be increased without elevating the pressure level generated. Technological improvements had made it possible to introduce into use long gun barrels that are strong enough to withstand the forces involved in accelerating the shell to a high velocity, while remaining light enough to be reasonably mobile, rigid enough to maintain accuracy, and having a bore able to withstand many firings before needing refurbishment. In World War I 45-caliber naval gun barrels were typical, in World War II 50- to 55-caliber barrels were common, with Germany already manufacturing tank guns of 70 calibers by 1943. Today 60- to 70-caliber barrels are not uncommon, but the latest technology has allowed shorter barrels of 55 calibers to attain muzzle velocities of , as with the Rheinmetall 120 mm tank gun. However, by using discarding sabots, many such guns fire projectiles which are much smaller than the gun bore, so the relationship of projectile size to barrel length is not as straightforward as with older ordnance.
