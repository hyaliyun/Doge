The four major peaks of Los Testigos are (west to east): Aparam√°n-tepui (2,100 m), Murisip√°n- tepui (2,350 m), Tereke-yur√©n-tepui (1,900 m), and Kamarkawarai-tepui (2,400 m), the latter three sharing a common slope area. There however remains some confusion in the literature regarding the names of these peaks. The Los Testigos chain has a total summit area of around and an estimated slope area of (the collective slope area of the three eastern tepuis being around , with the isolated Aparam√°n-tepui contributing a further ). The chain is situated entirely within the bounds of Canaima National Park. Torres, I.N. & D.D. Mart√≠n (November 2007). Mejorando Nuestra Herencia. In line with and to the west of the Los Testigos chain lies the Los Hermanos massif, which consists of two upland peaks: Amaruay-tepui and Padapu√©-tepui.

The estate is now the Shaw Hill Hotel, Golf Club and Country Club. The house is a three-storey building of ashlar with hipped slate roofs concealed by a parapet, and it incorporates elements of a smaller, earlier house. Three structures from the estate are separately recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II listed buildings: the lodge, the gate piers, and the house itself. History The Crosse family of East Lancashire first acquired property in the Chorley area around 1400 and built a house on the Whittle-le-Woods site in the 1700s. Richard Crosse Legh was the High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1807 and a deputy-lieutenant of Lancashire. He bequeathed Shaw Hill to his daughter Anna Mary Crosse, who in 1828 married Thomas Bright Ikin, who then adopted the Crosse name as his surname. He commissioned Charles Reed of Birkenhead to rebuild the existing house during the 1830s and asked William Sawrey Gilpin to landscape the estate. Thomas Bright Crosse was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1837 and was briefly MP for Wigan in 1841 (before his election was declared void). After his death ownership of the property passed to his son Thomas Richard Crosse, Hon. Colonel of the 3rd and 4th Battalions, North Lancashire Regiment, who died in 1897. He had married Mary, the eldest daughter of the 4th Earl of Castle Stewart and had two daughters; Kathleen Mary and Ella Beatrice. Kathleen Mary never married and Ella Beatrice married John Ormerod Scarlet Thursby. The estate is now operated as a country house hotel and golf club. The house is owned and run by the Stokes family and offers 30 bedrooms, a restaurant and an indoor swimming pool. The golf club was founded in 1923 and now maintains an 18-hole course.

They are located within the caudal medulla oblongata, in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). HSD2 neurons are activated during a prolonged deficit in body sodium or fluid volume, as occurs after dietary sodium deprivation or during frank hypovolemia. They are also activated by supraphysiologic stimulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor. They are inactivated when salt is ingested. To date, HSD2 neurons have been identified and studied only in rats and mice.  Basic characteristics  Brainstem(where HSD2 neurons are located) The term \\"HSD2 neurons\\" is used in the scientific literature to refer to a subpopulation of neurons in the NTS which express both the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2). HSD2 is an enzyme that metabolizes cortisol and other glucocorticosteroids, which typically prevent aldosterone from binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor. This pre-receptor mechanism for modifying hormone binding is necessary for cellular sensitivity to aldosterone because, under physiologic conditions, cortisol circulates at 100-1000 times higher concentrations than aldosterone. As both cortisol and aldosterone bind the mineralocorticoid receptor with equal affinity, cortisol effectively crowds out aldosterone in cells without abundant HSD2. In cells with HSD2, however, aldosterone has increased access to the MR, such that increases and decreases in the circulating concentration of this hormone will produce a change in receptor activity. In HSD2 neurons (and all other cells that express both HSD2 and MR), aldosterone binds to MR and translocates it from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, causing transcriptional changes. Unlike aldosterone-sensitive cells in epithelial tissues (e.g. in the kidney), the physiologic effects of aldosterone-MR activation in HSD2 neurons are unknown. It has been suggested, but not proven, that aldosterone promotes the firing activity of these neurons. Aldosterone is not necessary for HSD2 neuron activation because this can be evoked by sodium deprivation even in rats without adrenal glands, which are the exclusive source of circulating aldosterone. HSD2 neurons express the transcription factor Phox2b. This means that HSD2 neurons probably release the excitatory transmitter glutamate onto their synaptic target neurons, as all Phox2b-expressing neurons in the NTS express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGlut2. HSD2 neurons do not produce a wide array of other proteins that typify most other subtypes of NTS neurons, including tyrosine hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, nitric oxide synthase, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, neuropeptide FF, substance P, somatostatin, inhibin-Œ≤, glucagon-like peptide-1, corticotropin-releasing hormone, dynorphin, calretinin, and calbindin. A small number of HSD2 neurons (less than 2%) may express the neuropeptide galanin. Their lack of expression of the aforementioned markers suggests that HSD2 neurons form a unique subpopulation within the NTS. To date, there is no information available about the electrophysiologic characteristics of these neurons.  Input and output connections  The efferent projections (axonal output) of HSD2 neurons have been investigated to a significant degree using conventional neuroanatomical tracers. Their primary output targets are the pre-locus coeruleus (pre-LC), the innermost portion of the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (PBel), and the anterior, ventrolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTvl). The next-order input and output connections of these target regions have been investigated in detail as well. Additional information about the efferent projections of HSD2 neurons can be found in ref. Regarding the afferent (input) connections to HSD2 neurons, available information is less complete. Experiments with conventional tracers and immunofluorescence staining have demonstrated peripheral viscerosensory input from the vagus nerve, input from nearby neurons in the NTS and area postrema, and descending input from the medial central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN). It is likely that other sources of input exist, but a comprehensive study of HSD2 neuron afferent connections has not been conducted.  HSD2 neuron activity  An immediate-early gene, c-fos, has been used to study the activation and inactivation of HSD2 neurons extensively in vivo. The presence of nuclear c-Fos implies recent, elevated neuronal activity, and c-Fos disappears after neurons become quiescent. Very few HSD2 neurons exhibit any c-Fos in a normal animal. If, however, sodium is removed from the diet for several days to a week, most HSD2 neurons become c-Fos- positive. Then, if salty food is eaten or a concentrated saline solution is imbibed, their c-Fos disappears. Several other experimental conditions that reduce extracellular fluid volume‚Äîincluding PEG-hypovolemia, diuresis, and adrenalectomy‚Äîalso activate HSD2 neurons, although none do so to as great an extent as simply removing sodium from the diet. Fos All of these conditions, with the exception of adrenalectomy, cause a large elevation of circulating aldosterone. Correspondingly, repeated administration of the mineralocorticosteroid hormone deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) produces a moderate increase in HSD2 neuron activity (c-Fos) without any sodium or volume deficit. However, even after adrenalectomy, HSD2 neurons become activated by sodium deprivation, proving that MR activation is not necessary for their activity. Thus, aldosterone may be sufficient, but is not necessary for their activation, meaning that these neurons integrate additional neural or hormonal input signals. All of the aforementioned manipulations which activate HSD2 neurons also produce sodium appetite in rats. If sodium-deprived rats are allowed access to salt, they imbibe a large quantity of it, and soon afterwards their HSD2 neurons are inactivated (they exhibit little or no c-Fos within 1‚Äì2 hours). This phenomenon of salt-intake-induced inactivation also occurs after sodium appetite and HSD2 neuron activation are produced by DOCA, which does not produce any sodium or volume deficit. Thus, HSD2 neuron inactivation by salt intake does not reflect simply the repletion of a physiologic deficit, and may instead reflect active inhibition triggered by salt ingestion. The exact mechanism for this inhibition remains unknown. An interesting and unique feature of HSD2 neuron activity is that they are not activated by several stimuli that produce pronounced c-Fos activation in most other neurons in the NTS. These stimuli include severe dehydration induced by hypertonic saline administration, salt ingestion (above), and changes in blood pressure. Thus, HSD2 neurons are selectively activated by conditions which do not significantly affect surrounding NTS neurons, and they are not stimulated (or are actively inhibited) by conditions that do prominently activate most other NTS neurons.  HSD2 neuron functions  The close association between sodium deprivation and HSD2 neuron activation‚Äîand between salt ingestion and HSD2 neuron inactivation‚Äîled to the suggestion that these neurons are important for driving sodium appetite. Other functional roles have been hypothesized. For discussion, see reviews in and. At present, however, no data exist to show whether these neurons are necessary or sufficient for any particular neurologic or physiologic function.

Bluff Point State Park is a public recreation area and nature preserve on an undeveloped peninsula located between the Poquonnock River and Mumford Cove on Long Island Sound in the town of Groton, Connecticut. The state park's encompass a barrier beach, steep cliffs, forested sections, and tidal wetlands; are designated as a coastal reserve. Recreational opportunities include hiking, mountain biking, boating, saltwater fishing, and shell fishing. The park is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.  History  The Pequot used Bluff Point as a source of seafood before the arrival of European colonists. In 1649, the Town of New London granted John Winthrop the Younger a plot of land that became the plantation called Winthrop's Neck. It included present day Bluff Point State Park, Haley Farm State Park, Poquonnock Bridge, Mumford Cove, and Groton Long Point. The property was subsequently divided into Great Farm, also known as Bluff Point, and the Fort Hill Farm. The farm building called Winthrop House was constructed on Bluff Point circa 1712 by Edward Yeomans on land leased from the Winthrop family. When it burned down in 1962, it left only a chimney standing that would later be used to reconstruct the Ebenezer Avery House's chimney after its relocation to Fort Griswold. The foundations of the farmhouse are still visible. The farm's crops included blackberry bushes and apple trees which continue to thrive. In the early 20th century, Bluff Point was part of an area known as Poquonnock Farm that was leased for potato farming by John Abbott Ackley. In 1892, Walter Denison opened a summer resort on Bushy Point. As interest in camping rose in the 1910s, Bluff Point became a popular destination by the 1920s. Tents and shacks grew into a small community of summer cottages by the 1930s. The owner of the property decided to stop subleasing the property in June 1938, with the termination in October 1 and the removal of the structures by November 1. Leary writes, \\"[b]efore a legal protest could be mounted, nature adjudicated the issue. On September 21, 1938, a massive hurricane came ashore at high tide. Except for the old Winthrop place, it destroyed nearly every building on the site.\\" Some 106 homes were lost. Bluff Point was proposed as a state recreation facility as early as 1914. The state acquired the western one-third of Bluff Point from Henry A. Gardiner III in 1963. During that time, the State sought to acquire the land because Bluff Point was the \\"last remaining significant portion of undeveloped shoreline in Connecticut\\" and that its \\"rocky bluffs standing behind narrow beaches typified the Connecticut coast.\\" The Bluff Point Advisory Council, a committee formed of local citizen groups and government representatives, successfully petitioned the state to acquire the land and protect it. The Connecticut legislature established Bluff Point as a Coastal Reserve in 1975. The act gave Bluff Point State Park the highest possible protection in the State Park system and serves to protect the high number of endangered and threatened species that are found within the park. According to legend, a boulder on the beach, known as Split Rock, suddenly split with \\"the sound of a cannon shot\\" in January 1780. Leary notes that it was likely split by freezing water that expanded in a crack in the rock. Sunset Rock was used by residents of the summer community for meetings and religious services; the sunset can no longer be seen from the rock. Plants and animals Diverse flora can be found at Bluff Point, owing to an intermingling of habitat areas including salt marshes, coastal woodlands, dunes and intertidal grass beds. This array of habitats also contributes to the broad range of birds found at the park. Several uncommon species of gulls, shorebirds and landbirds are among the more than 200 species of birds that have been observed throughout Bluff Point. In contrast, terrestrial animals residing in the park are of fairly common species, including deer, coyotes, foxes and smaller mammals such as rabbits, raccoons and opossums. Offshore wildlife includes horseshoe crabs, clams, mussels, snails and a multitude of crustaceans. Activities and amenities The park is notable for bird watching; over 200 species have been seen at the site. Other activities include picnicking, saltwater fishing, shell fishing, hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking. A ramp for car-top boating is available. Fish caught at Bluff Point include striped bass, sea trout, bluefish, and summer flounder.

It was established in 1986. It is considered the best example of coastal mangrove swamp on the island. It includes the Hungry Bay area and the largest mangrove coastal swamp in Bermuda. It is protected by a Tree preservation order (T.P.O.) and designated as an official Nature Reserve within the Parks system of Bermuda. The Hungry Bay Mangrove Swamp Reserve, a wetland site, is one of the seven Ramsar Sites in Bermuda. This designation recognises its international importance as a northerly mangrove swamp, as a habitat for its native crustaceans and as an important destination for migratory birds. Most of the reserve consists of mangrove swamp, while in the southern part there is a small area of saltmarsh. Much damage was done to the site by a storm in 2003 and residents have expressed concern about possible environmental damage resulting from pollution from the village of Seabright. History The reserve was proposed as a National Nature Reserve under the Development and Planning Act of 1974. It was part of the Development Plan of 1983. While the mangroves are under the Tree Preservation Order, the reserve in general is decreed as a National Reserve under the Bermuda National Parks Act of 1986. The Hungry Bay Mangrove Swamp Reserve is one of the seven Ramsar Sites in Bermuda. It was approved as a Ramsar site of international importance on 10 May 1999, meeting the criteria (1, 2, 3, 4 and 8) for its unique characteristics. Its significance is due to being the largest northerly mangrove swamp in the Atlantic Ocean, the many migratory bird species which visit during winter, and the many native crustacean species, including the endangered terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus) and giant land crab (Cardisoma guanhumi). During Hurricane Fabian in September 2003, the outer (western) third of the swamp, accounting for 25‚Äì30% of the total area of mangroves, suffered total destruction. Global warming has also caused rise in tidal levels resulting in damage to the swamps. More recently, residents have begun to voice concerns over the Seabright sewage outflow, which enters Hungry Bay itself. A resident of the Bay noted the persistent appearance of a \\"shiny slick\\" emanating from Seabright extending to the \\"reef-line a few hundred yards off\\". Geography Bermuda's largest tidal mangrove swamp is situated in a sea bay on the east coast of Bermuda, in an enclosed coast with a narrow opening from the sea, Hungry Bay. Reported as the most northerly mangrove swamp in the world, it is shallow with a depth of about during high tide. The area is small at , of which 99% is of tidal mangrove forest and the balance 1% is made up of permanent brackish marshes. The soil conditions comprise clay, mud, peat and sand. It has perennial source of water and is of water quality varying from brackish to mixosaline, saline and euhaline in different zones. Climatic conditions in the reserve is subtropical with mild temperatures with humidity. Storms and gales are a common feature during winter. The reserve consists of dense forest of red and black mangrove trees. A large number of sea water channels flow through the area which rise and fall with the tides. These tidal channels are an important habitat for small fish. Crabs and other marine creatures are found here. The trees are the habitat for many species of birds. Snails and insects are commonly found in the reserve. The reserve can be reached by road, though access is limited, or by boat travelling directly through the bay. The reserve operates a small wharf capable of receiving boat traffic. Flora Vegetation in the mangrove swamps consists primarily of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) and red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). Other species of trees reported around the mangroves are buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus), rush (Juncus acutus), sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum), sea ox-eye (Borrichia arborescens), sea lavender (Limonium caroliniatum), Paspalum vaginatum, Sporobolus virginicus, woody glasswort (Sarcocornia perennis) and West Indian grass (Eustachys petraea). Tropical mangrove swamp characterises the northern areas of the reserve while the southern areas primarily represent temperate saltmarsh. Invasive plants, notably among them casuarina, are adversely affecting the growth of the mangrove swamp, and therefore in addition giant land and hermit crabs, endemic snail species. Habitat restoration measures are underway to retain the mangroves and other native species. Fauna The faunal species reported from the mangrove swamp include several species of crabs: the giant land crab (Cardisoma guanhumi) ( only two colonies exists in the upper regions of the swamp), the terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus) (54 individuals recorded in 1990), and the mangrove crab (Goniopsis cruentatus). =Avifauna= Significant avifauna reported in the reserve are the great blue heron (Ardea herodias), yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea), snowy egret (Egretta thula), mallard (Anas platyrhynchus), belted kingfisher, Megaceryle alcyon and northern waterthrush (Parkesia noveboracensis), which are all wintering bird species. Feral pigeons, which are displacing tropic birds from their nesting sites in cliff-holes and ledges, need to be eliminated from the reserve to preserve the native species of birds, according to efforts made to control their population thus far.

It is based on the stage play When Women Wee scripted by Hirons, devised by Natasha Sparkes, Stephanie Jay, Emily Wallis, Amirah Garba, Amy Revelle, Stef O'Driscoll, and Jennifer Davies. The film stars Sheridan Smith, Jaime Winstone, Kate Nash, and Oona Castilla Chaplin. Plot The comedy follows Sam, as her life is turned upside down on a big night out. When reunited with her old college friends, Sam is forced to re-evaluate her life and constructs an elaborate fa√ßade in order to convince herself and her friends that she has it all. But once her dysfunctional yet devoted trio of best mates intervene, her carefully crafted charade begins to crumble amidst the shots, cigarettes, ciders and toilet transgressions. Faced with some very harsh realities, Sam must struggle to remain true to herself and reassess exactly what she wants from life. The film tells its story in a series of vignettes showing conversations held in the powder room of a nightclub. The story was partly inspired by a clubbing trip on which Hirons overheard two women talking candidly about anal sex in a cubicle of a women's toilet.

He was a three-time Swiss champion in cross-country skiing. In 1921, he took part in the first ascent of the Mittellegigrat (the northeast ridge of the Eiger).  Skier  Fritz Steuri came into contact with skiing in the early 1890s when he saw the Englishman Gerald Fox (who lived at Tone Dale House) skiing in Grindelwald. In 1898, he bought his first pair of skis from a Grindelwald manufactory. The first ski race was held in Grindelwald before the turn of the century, in which Steuri, who pursued regular ski training, took part with other locals. Even in his job as a postman, which he held from 1899 until he became a mountain guide, he rendered valuable services to skiing.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), pp. 83, 149. In 1902, he was among the founding members of the Grindelwald Ski Club.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), p. 155. Fritz Steuri became one of the best skiers in the early days of Swiss ski racing. Especially in endurance or alpine endurance, as cross- country skiing was called, he was a leading athlete in the early twentieth century. In January 1903, Steuri won the Grindelwald ski club's second race in downhill skiing and came second in both ski jumping and endurance.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), p. 157. In January 1904 he won the third club downhill race.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), p. 160. In February 1903, Steuri won the \\"International Cup in alpine endurance\\" organized in Adelboden by the Ski Club of Bern, which he also won in 1904 (again in Adelboden) and 1905 (in Zweisimmen).Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), pp. 158-159. From 1904 to 1906, he won three consecutive major Grindelwald endurance ski races. After the founding of the Swiss Ski Federation on 20 November 1904, on 21 and 22 January 1905 the first Swiss ski championships (\\"Erstes Grosses Skirennen der Schweiz\\") were held in Glarus. Steuri was the Swiss champion in endurance. On the 20-kilometer route over the Pragel Pass with 560 meters slope and 1160 meters down, he came in first of 32 participants in a time of 1 hour, 54 minutes and 7 seconds. In 1906 in Zweisimmen and 1907 in Davos Steuri was again the Swiss champion in endurance, whereupon he was asked not to participate in this race to offer other athletes a chance to win.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), pp. 159-160, 183. Steuri also worked as a ski instructor. He instructed Hermann and Othmar Gurtner and Walter Amstutz in alpine driving technique and the \\"classic\\" snowplough turns Telemark, stem Christie and stem turn.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), p. 217. In 1926 Steuri was president of the Grindelwald ski club.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), p. 223. He gave ski lessons into the 1930s.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), p. 219.  Mountain guide  Besides skiing, Fritz Steuri was also a renowned mountain guide. In 1905 he earned his leader patent, having previously climbed numerous summits, including the Jungfrau, the Eiger, the Finsteraarhorn and the Wetterhorn. Steuri worked for 45 years as a mountain guide, mainly around Grindelwald and in the Valais and Grison Alps. On 10 September 1921 he took part in the first ascent of the Mittellegigrat (the northeast ridge of the Eiger) with the Japanese climber Yuko Maki and fellow guides Fritz Amatter and Samuel Brawand.Vom Bergbauerndorf zum Fremdenort (Rubi), p. 171. The descent of the ridge had been made for the first time in 1885. Shortly beforehand, Steuri had climbed the Dufourspitze, the Matterhorn and the Aletschhorn with Maki and Brawand. Subsequently Steuri led many Japanese on Alpine summits, including Prince Chichibu, with whom Steuri and other guides climbed the Wetterhorn, the Finsteraarhorn, the Schreckhorn, the Matterhorn, the summit of Monte Rosa and other mountains in September 1926. On 26 May 1926 Steuri, Prince Chichibu, Walter Amstutz, Arnold Lunn and two others first climbed the Grindelwalder Gr√ºnhorn on skis. Among other famous clients Steuri counted the writer Konrad Falke, whom he guided in September 1907 in the Jungfrau region. This resulted in Falke's 1909 published book Im Banne der Jungfrau (Under the Spell of the Virgin). From about 1930, Steuri specialized as a Jungfrau guide. He worked as one of the \\"Jochf√ºhrer\\", the guides who after the construction of the Jungfrau railway were always stationed at Jungfraujoch and led tourists from there to the surrounding peaks. As a result, in his lifetime Steuri made 1139 ascents of the Jungfrau - sometimes twice in a day.Der Sommer- und Winterkurort (Rubi), pp. 51-52. In summer 1938 Steuri led the search party that discovered the body of Italian climber Bartolo Sandri, who had died along with his partner, Mario Menti, in an attempt on the north face of the Eiger.The White Spider (Harrer), p. 80. Steuri was sometime landlord of the Konkordia Hut and chairman of the Grindelwald mountain rescue.  Family  Fritz Steuri had four sons, the three eldest of whom were also known as mountain guides:Vom Bergbauerndorf zum Fremdenort (Rubi), p. 207. Fritz Jr. (1908-1953), Hermann (1909-2001), Hans (1911-1975) and Rudolf (1913-1987). Fritz Jr. and Hermann scored numerous successes in ski racing.

Newton never married, and was regarded as a friendly and persistent individual with drive and a warm personality. She often \\"worked to the point of exhaustion\\". Early life Newton was born in Montreal on 20 April 1887 to John Newton and Elizabeth Brown. She had four younger siblings, three brothers named Robert, John, and William, and a sister named Dorothy. Her father was a chemist interested in the application of science to farming. Her formal education began in a one- room schoolhouse at North Nation Mills, a mill town of about 300 residents on the Petite-Nation River north of Plaisance. The family moved to Montreal when her father took a higher-paying job. There, Newton completed middle school and two years of high school, after which the family returned to Plaisance. Here, Newton completed high school, attended country school for two more years, then taught at the North Nation Mills schoolhouse for one year. She then moved to Vankleek Hill in Ontario, continuing her education at Vankleek Hill Collegiate Institute before completing her teacher training at the Toronto Normal School. She then taught in Lachine for three years, and at the North Nation Mills schoolhouse for one year. The money she saved was used to finance her post- secondary education. Passionate about art, Newton enrolled in an Arts program at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, completing one year of studies before returning to Montreal, where she enrolled in an agricultural program at Macdonald College. There, she was the only female in a class of 50 students, and was the recipient of the Governor General's Academic Medal for top achievement. At this time, she joined the Quebec Society for the Protection of Plants, becoming its first female member. She was also a member of the debating society, and president of the literary society for one year. In her second year at Macdonald College, She took W.P. Fraser‚Äôs myology course and became interested in his research on cereal rust diseases of plants, which led to her interest and study in plant pathology. Her advisor W.P. Fraser travelled to Western Canada in 1917 so he could begin researching stem rust from a devastating epidemic in 1916 that had destroyed 100 million bushels of wheat worth about $200 million. He assigned Newton to study the samples he collected, who accepted only after the school's dean eliminated restrictions on women using laboratory facilities at night; she still had to contend with the 22:00 curfew of her residence. During her research, she discovered that stem rust spores infected wheat with different rapaciousness. Newton and her friend Pearl Clayton Stanford graduated in 1918 with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (B.S.A.), becoming the first women to complete a degree at the college. The next year, she received a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree, for which her thesis The Resistance of Wheat Varieties to Puccinia graminis covered \\"different spore forms within the stem rust fungus\\". Throughout, her academic achievement was the top of her class. Research Stem rust Puccinia graminis on a stalk of wheat. In 1920, as a result of her research into grain rusts while completing her undergraduate and master's degrees at Macdonald College, she was offered a research position at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. She accepted, and from 1922 to 1925 was on faculty as an assistant professor in the Department of Biology, joining her former advisor W.P. Fraser, among which duties was included teaching. During this time, she conducted her doctoral studies at the University of Minnesota, where under the supervision of Elvin C. Stakman she was the first woman in Canada to complete her Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in agricultural science in 1922 with the dissertation Studies in wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis tritici). Stakman had also been researching stem rust. She did this by spending six months in Minnesota, then six months in Saskatoon. In 1925, she was invited by William Richard Motherwell, the federal Minister of Agriculture, to help manage the newly opened Dominion Rust Research Laboratory at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, established as a response to rust outbreaks in 1916, 1919, and 1921. She was appointed the laboratory's senior plant pathologist, a position she maintained until retirement, and brought with her former student Thorvaldur Johnson as her research assistant. She established an annual stem rust survey in Western Canada, discovering a diversity of races in rust populations, which eventually enabled her to discover and catalogue the wheat species and cross-species resistant to stem rust. She published 45 scientific papers on stem rust fungi and 11 research summaries. In 1929, she became a charter member of the Canadian Phytopathological Society and became one of the editors for the journal Phytopathology. Newton identified physiologically distinct races of Puccinia graminis and focused on determining their genetic structure, physiology, origin, and life cycle. She investigated stripe rust on wheat and barley and wheat leaf rust, and the environmental factors on disease expression in wheat plants. She also researched the genetic structure of wheat rust pathogens. The research attracted global attention, particularly from scientists in grain-growing nations dealing with productivity losses from stem rust. She was by this time internationally regarded as an authority on plant rusts, and represented Canada at scientific conventions in the United States, Europe, and Russia. Her research was economically significant, as it was used to develop rust-resistant wheat cultivars and resulted in a \\"reduction of annual losses of wheat due to rust from 30 million bushels to practically none\\". Wheat rust is no longer a significant problem in Canada. In 1933 the Government of the Soviet Union, worried about persistent crop losses caused by stem rust, invited Newton to Leningrad at the behest of Nikolai Vavilov to \\"train fifty carefully selected students in the problems of rust research\\". She was there for three months, during which she enjoyed a privileged status similar to a Russian official, and was shown every phase of plant research conducted at the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Vavilov had attempted to lure her to work in Leningrad in 1930 by offering a generous salary, technical support, and a camel caravan for travel. Retirement Her continued exposure to stem rust spores exacerbated a respiratory ailment, which would lead to an early retirement in 1945 and a move to Victoria. Farmers petitioned on her behalf for the Government of Canada to grant her a full pension, as she had \\"saved the country millions of dollars\\". In retirement, she continued to share her expertise, travelling to Russia and Africa to assist in rust mitigation programs, and attending conventions and conferences. In 1950, she attended the International Botanical Congress in Sweden and the International Federation of University Women conference in Switzerland. She became active in women's groups and tended a garden at her home, and had active hobbies including birdwatching and canoeing. Newton died in Victoria on 6 April 1971. Legacy and awards Newton earned many awards and honours throughout her life. In 1942, she became the second woman to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) after Alice Wilson. She was awarded the Flavelle Medal from the Royal Society of Canada in 1948, the first person to graduate from an agricultural college to receive the award, and the only woman to have earned that distinction. In 1956, the University of Minnesota gave her an Outstanding Achievement Award, presented by her Ph.D. advisor Elvin Stakman, and on 13 May 1969 the University of Saskatchewan gave her an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree. In 1964, the University of Victoria completed construction of the first phase of a residence complex for female students; one of the four-storey buildings was named Margaret Newton Hall in her honour. The others were named for Emily Carr, David Thompson, and Arthur Currie. On 1997 September 22, she was registered in the Persons of National Historic Significance, a register of people designated by the Government of Canada as being nationally significant in the history of the country. A plaque was installed at the Fort Garry campus of the University of Manitoba to recognize this honour. Newton was inducted to the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 1991. On 17 July 2008, she was inducted into the Manitoba Agricultural Hall of Fame, and a plaque in her honour was erected in Portage la Prairie and officially revealed in a ceremony attended by her relatives and \\"representatives from grain research centres\\".

The site of the state park once formed part of the lands granted to Governor John Winthrop and later became a dairy farm. The park's are connected to the adjacent Bluff Point State Park by way of a pedestrian bridge over railroad tracks. Park activities are restricted to bicycling and walking. The park is managed by Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History Haley Farm homestead walls and ruins today. Land containing the acreage for Haley Farm State Park was part of a larger parcel granted to John Winthrop, Jr., in 1649. Known as \\"John Winthrop the Younger,\\" Winthrop was governor of the Saybrook Colony and is often recognized as \\"Connecticut's first governor.\\" The land was later split up, with the piece containing Haley Farm designated as Fort Hill Farm. The farm was purchased by Starr Chester in 1789 and passed to Noyes Barber in 1833. The land was split again in 1852 with the farm being sold to Henry B. Lewis. Four hundred acres were sold to Caleb Haley in 1869 for the price of $12,000. Haley farmed the land, built stone walls throughout the property and raced horses around \\"Racetrack Pond.\\" The land passed to his son, Samuel Haley, after his death in 1924. Samuel Haley continued to operate the farm until his death in 1947, when it was passed to his daughter Juliet Haley. The farm produced cream and milk that was shipped to Noank, West Mystic and Mystic. In 1953, the farm was sold out of the Haley family to A. C. White who abandoned the farm to develop a gully called Mumford Cove and placed the 250-acre parcel of land containing Haley Farm for sale. In 1960, the homestead burned down and the other buildings eventually were demolished in 1973 after being documented for possible future reconstruction. In 1963, efforts were made to purchase the land to prevent it from being developed. The town opposed re-zoning the site for multi-residential development. The land was sold from Alcor Inc. to O&G; Construction Co. as a 250-acre parcel in 1966. A total of 198 acres of land was returned to White when O&G; Construction \\"were in arrears on their payments and back taxes.\\" In July 1970, the state acquired 198 acres of Haley Farm from A. C. White for a total of $300,000, with federal funding accounting for $150,000, state funding for $100,000, and the remaining $50,000 coming from the Groton Open Space Association, a local organization that completed raising the required funds in early 1970. At the time, the Park and Forest Commission said there were no plans to make it into a park. However, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection recognizes that Haley Farm was officially made a Connecticut State Park in July 1970. In 1975, a bike trail from Mystic to Noank was established, part which goes through the Haley Farm State Park. In 2001, the \\"Racetrack Pond\\" area was purchased from the Mumford Cove Association. In 2002, a total of 57 acres was added to the park through the purchase 49.95 acres from Guerra-DeAngelis Trustees and 7.14 acres from Bowen Briggs for a total purchase price of $913,300. The funds for the purchase, which was 30 years in the making, were provided by the State of Connecticut's Recreation and Natural Heritage Trust Program. Vegetation Pedestrian bridge connecting Haley Farm and Bluff Point state parks The park hosts a wide range of upland and wetland vegetation. Algae and intertidal plants can be found at the shore including salt meadow grass, sedge, and sphagnum moss; the park's swampy areas have red maple and tulip trees; the upland sections include cherry, hickory, and shrubs. Activities and amenities The park offers trails for non-motorized uses: hiking, jogging, and cycling. The park is connected to Bluff Point State Park over a pedestrian bridge that crosses Amtrak railroad tracks, built atop the former Groton and Stonington Street Railway bridge. The park's bike trail forms part of a town- owned bikeway from Mystic to Groton.

At that time, Ryan Cohen prepared to take Chewy public as both Petco and PetSmart approached with merger offers.Susan Adams, \\"The Man Who Found Gold in Dog Food,\\" Forbes, January 24, 2017. Petco's offer would be paid for in part using stock, whereas PetSmart offered an all-cash bid that would also allow Chewy to remain a completely separate business. Chewy was acquired by PetSmart in May 2017 for $3.35 billion, which at the time was the largest ever acquisition of an e-commerce business.Jason Del Ray, \\"Ryan Cohen kept Chewy under the radar until it sold for more than $3 billion,\\" Recode, December 6, 2017. Allen & Co. served as financial advisor to Chewy on the deal.Jessica Dye, \\"PetSmart makes online push with Chewy.com deal,\\" Financial Times, April 18, 2017. PetSmart later transferred 20% of its ownership stake in Chewy to private equity firm BC Partners, which has owned PetSmart since 2014, and also spun off an additional 16.5% of Chewy to an unrestricted subsidiary in 2018. Between 2017 and 2018, Chewy‚Äôs sales increased from $2.1 billion to $3.5 billion, with 66% of sales coming from customers signed up for automatic recurring shipments. Chewy received the Stevie Award for Favorite Customer Service in Retail in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, Chewy created Chewy Pharmacy, an online pharmacy providing pet-targeted prescription medications. Orders placed through the business are completed in coordination with a team of in-house veterinarians. On April 29, 2019, Chewy filed an S-1 for an initial public offering, intending to trade under the ticker symbol CHWY. In its filing, Chewy reported a net loss of $268 million on total sales of $3.5 billion for its 2018 fiscal year. Chewy went public on June 14, 2019, at $22 per share. Corporate affairs The company's founder and first CEO, Ryan Cohen, stated that he used Jeff Bezos's 1997 letter to shareholders as a roadmap for how to grow Chewy by using Amazon's guidelines on the convenience of shopping online and customer service. Sumit Singh was named the company's CEO in March 2018 after working as its COO since 2017 and as an executive at Dell and Amazon.Stephanie Crets, \\"Roundup: Chewy CEO steps down and other personnel news,\\" Internet Retailer, March 16, 2018.

He is an associate professor at George Mason University and the BB&T; Professor for the Study of Capitalism at the Mercatus Center.https://www.mercatus.org/garett-jones Early life and education Jones was raised as a Mormon, but left the church.https://www.exmormon.org/whylft18.htm He completed a B.A. in history with a minor in sociology from Brigham Young University in 1992. He did an M.P.A. in public affairs at Cornell University in 1993, followed by an M.A. in political science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1994. Jones completed a Ph.D. in economics at the University of California, San Diego in 2000. Academic career After holding a number of visiting scholar and other academic positions, Jones joined the faculty of George Mason University in 2007. He is on the editorial board of the Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics. =Research on IQ and its role in productivity and economic growth= Jones started his research on IQ in a paper with Joel Schneider in 2006 that argued that IQ is a statistically significant explanatory variable of economic growth, thus agreeing broadly with the thesis advanced by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen in their book IQ and the Wealth of Nations. The chief observation that Jones made, and popularized, is that national IQs have much greater predictive power for individual earnings than individual IQ. Jones' further research has been on identifying the causal mechanisms by which IQ might affect productivity and economic growth at a national level. One mechanism posited by Jones is that smarter groups tend to be better at arriving at and enforcing norms of cooperation. Jones has used laboratory experiments involving repeated prisoner's dilemma, combined with the SAT scores of participants, to offer support for this hypothesis. He has also suggested that patience and delayed gratification might offer an explanation. Jones has argued that certain sectors requiring very high quality work and with very low error-tolerance can only exist and thrive given access to a high-IQ population, because in such sectors, it is not possible to replace a single high-IQ worker by multiple low-IQ workers and achieve the same output. Jones informally dubs such sectors \\"O-Ring sectors\\", in contrast to \\"foolproof sectors\\", where a larger workforce of people with lower productivity can produce the same output as a smaller workforce of people with high productivity. Jones offers a summary of his and others' research on the relationship between IQ and national productivity in an article for The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. =Research on money= Some of Jones' research has focused on the role of money, monetary policy, and mechanisms to reduce the risk of financial crisis. Books Jones wrote the book Hive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, which builds on his research on the relationship between IQ and national productivity. It was released in November 2015 by Stanford University Press.http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/npe/?tab=2 He was the editor of the book Banking Crises (2016), produced for The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics.http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137553782 His book 10% Less Democracy: How Less Voting Could Mean Better Governance, was published on 7 February 2020.

Early life and education  Zhou was born in 1957 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. He was admitted to Wenzhou Medical College in 1977 and graduated 1982. His wife Xiao-Yi Sun (Â≠ôÂ∞è‰æù) was his classmate at the college. He subsequently earned a master's degree from Zhejiang Medical University, where he pursued his research interest in HPV. He then earned his M.D. at Henan Medical University (now medical school of Zhengzhou University) and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Beijing Medical University, before moving to the University of Cambridge in 1988 to continue his research in cancer and virus.  HPV and Papilloma vaccine  Zhou met future research partner Ian Frazer at the University of Cambridge in 1989, bonded by a mutual respect and willingness to push the limits of their research. The two considered the problem of developing a vaccine for HPV ‚Äì a virus that cannot be cultured without living tissue. Frazer convinced Zhou to join him at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, and in 1990 they began to use molecular biology to synthesize particles in vitro that could mimic the virus. In March 1991 Zhou's wife and fellow researcher, Xiao-Yi Sun, assembled by Zhou's instructionsVaccines Forgotten Man [www.theaustralian.com.au/news/tribute-to-vaccines-forgotten-man- story-e6frg600-1111116233989] two proteins into a virus-like particle (VLP), resembling the HPV shell, from which HPV vaccine would ultimately be made. The vaccine completely protects unexposed women against four HPV strains responsible for 70% of cervical cancers, which kill about 250,000 women annually. Estimates of the contemporary global mortality rate have remained in the 190,000 to 300,000 range from 2000 to 2010. The 2007 WHO progress report says that preventable cervical cancer \\"was responsible in 2005 for up to 500,000 new cases, and up to 257,000 deaths, more than 90% in low- and middle- income countries\\", but, \\"According to WHO‚Äôs projections, deaths from cervical cancer will rise to 320,000 in 2015 and to 435,000 in 2030\\" (p.4). These projections may be little effected by vaccination programs (anyway unlikely on cost grounds) because \\"A reduction in cancer incidence and mortality might not be measurable before 10 to 30 years after the vaccine is introduced.\\" (p.5). Other estimates of the problem's scale are broadly in agreement:  * Frazer and Zhou filed a provisional patent in June 1991 and began work on developing the vaccine within UQ. To finance clinical trials, Australian medical company CSL, and later Merck, were sold partial patents. (CSL has the exclusive license to sell Gardasil in New Zealand and Australia, Merck the license elsewhere.) GlaxoSmithKline independently used the same VLP-approach to develop Cervarix, under a later US patent, licensing Frazer's intellectual property in 2005.  Death  In March 1999, Zhou died of hepatitis, a disease he had contracted as a young man in China. He was survived by his wife Xiao-Yi Sun and son Andreas Zhou.

It is located next to St. Paul's Church along Middle Road in Paget Parish, to the south of Hamilton Harbour. The official reserve is protected by the Bermuda National Trust and Bermuda Audubon Society. It is also a Ramsar wetland of international importance. The reserve's extensive peat marsh remains unchanged since the days of the first settlers. It is dotted with Bermuda cedar and Sabal bermudana palmetto trees. An extensive boardwalk, erected in 1999, has made the ponds, mangroves, grasslands, and forests accessible. The water bodies and forests in this area provide habitat for a variety of wildlife, especially birds. Geography The reserve is located in Paget Parish adjoining the St. Paul's Church at the crossing of Middle Road and Lover's Lane. It is prehistoric forest land, which covers an oval area of . The marsh has peat to depths of which is acidic and does not permit growth of many of the natural species of Bermuda, as it gets flooded during high tides. It is well preserved, whereas similar marshes in the island have become garbage dumps. To view the natural beauty of its giant ferns, palmetto fronds and delicate forest of Carex bermudiana Bermuda sedge in the bogs, a long, wide wooden boardwalk has been erected on floating pontoons. This boardwalk passes through the following ecosystem in the order of ecological succession: the red mangrove forest, thick browny-green wax myrtle bushes, savannah saw-grass terminating in the ancient primeval forest of Bermuda cedars and palmettos. History The discovery of the marsh is credited to Sir George Somers and his crew from England on their voyage which was shipwrecked between two reefs just off the coast of Bermuda in 1609. They were then the first to report on the dense primeval forest of cedar and palmetto found in the marsh lands of the island. Another historical incident reported is of the destructive introduction of two scale insects, Lepidosaphes newsteadi and Carulaspis minima, which caused extensive damage to cedar forest between 1946 and 1951. This reduced the extent of the cedar to just one percent of what had earlier existed. However, introduction of cedar resistant to them has enabled restoration to the extent of about ten percent now. Further increase in growth has been inhibited on account of introduction of casuarina trees and other invasive plant species. Yet the reserve is reported to be the \\"best surviving example of native cedar, palmetto, and mangrove forests.\\" Paget Marsh is now one of the 12 nature reserves and 63 parks established to protect the ecosystem of the island. It is under the joint ownership of the Bermuda National Trust and the Bermuda Audubon Society and is very well managed; the former organization holds the central part of the reserve, the latter organization has ownership of the lands on either side of the reserve. A reforestation program is being conducted by the Bermuda Department of Conservation Services. Wildlife The pond was created in the preserve, which in the 1920s was a garbage dump, at the initiative of the Audubon Society. It has become a sanctuary for resident and migratory birds and many species of wildlife. Efforts are now being made to introduce male and female species of the endemic killifish (Fundulous bermudae), a rare species mentioned in the \\"Field Book of Shore Fishes of Bermuda\\" (1933) by Beebe and Tee-Van. The vegetation found in the reserve includes palmetto trees, Bermuda cedars and mangrove swamp.

In the aftermath, the reactor experienced hydrogen gas explosions and suffered a partial meltdown, along with the other two reactors in operation at the time the tsunami struck, unit 1 and unit 2. Efforts to remove debris and coolant water contaminated with radiation are ongoing and expected to last several decades. 2011 tsunami and aftermath The was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. It is the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.\\"Analysis: A month on, Japan nuclear crisis still scarring\\" International Business Times (Australia). 9 April 2011, retrieved 12 April 2011; excerpt, According to James Acton, Associate of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \\"Fukushima is not the worst nuclear accident ever but it is the most complicated and the most dramatic ... This was a crisis that played out in real time on TV. Chernobyl did not.\\" The plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in the cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However, the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent a meltdown. Saltwater flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point, it was already too late to prevent meltdown.F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139 As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened? Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident, workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, seawater that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance. Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.Stricken reactors may get power Sunday, The Wall Street Journal, 19 March 2011 Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.Justin McCurry. Japan raises nuclear alert level to seven. The Guardian. 12 April 2011 The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. The Japanese government estimates the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30‚Äì50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants.Japan mulls Fukushima food ban: IAEA, Reuters, 19 March 2011 In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \\"into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone\\" although it has been said staff may have been told to lie, and give false readings to try and cover up true levels of radiation. An \\"Official Use Only\\" report obtained by FOIA from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (3/18/2011) written one week after the tsunami hit Fukushima states, \\"The source term provided to NARAC was: (1) 25% of the total fuel in unit 2 released to the atmosphere, (2) 50% of the total spent fuel from unit 3 was released to the atmosphere, and (3) 100% of the total spent fuel was released to the atmosphere from unit 4\\".http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1212/ML12122A949.pdf NARAC produced a \\"worst case\\" speculative model based on these assumptions. However, this model did not include an assumption of a release from Unit 1, and the assumption of \\"100% of the total spent fuel was released to the atmosphere from unit 4\\" has since been proven incorrect with the subsequent removal of the fuel from the spent pool fuel. A few of the plant's workers were severely injured or killed by the disaster conditions resulting from the earthquake. There were no immediate deaths due to direct radiation exposures, but at least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged from none to 100 to a non-peer-reviewed \\"guesstimate\\" of 1,000. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. On 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. Unit 3 Reactor Reactor Unit 3 (right) and Unit 4 (left) on 16 March. Three of the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi overheated, causing meltdowns which released large amounts of radioactive material into the air. Pipes are the direction of the ocean. Unlike the other five reactor units, reactor 3 ran on mixed core, containing both uranium fuel and mixed uranium and plutonium oxide, or MOX fuel (with the core comprising ~6% MOX fuel), during a loss of cooling accident in a subcritical reactor MOX fuel will not behave differently from UOX fuel. The key difference between plutonium-239 and uranium-235 is that plutonium emits fewer delayed neutrons than uranium when it undergoes fission. While water-insoluble forms of plutonium such as plutonium dioxide are very harmful to the lungs, this toxicity is not relevant during a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) because plutonium is very involatile and unlikely to leave the reactor in large amounts. Plutonium dioxide has a very high boiling point. The toxic effect of the plutonium to the public under these conditions is much less than that of iodine-131 and caesium. During a loss of cooling accident, the fuel is not subject to such intense mechanical stresses, so the release of radioactivity is controlled by the boiling point of the different elements present.J.-P. Hiernaut, T. Wiss, D. Papaioannou, R.J.M. Konings, V.V. Rondinella, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 2008, volume 372, pages 215 to 225 =Cooling problems= Following the reactor SCRAM, operators activated the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC) and the residual heat removal system and core spray systems were made available to cool the suppression pool; whether they were activated prior to the tsunami has not been made clear. The RHRS and CS pumps were knocked out of commission by the tsunami. With DC battery power remaining, the RCIC continued to keep the water level stable, and the operators switched to the high-pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system when water level began to drop. On 13 March, the HPCI system failed, the reason for which is not completely clear due to instrumentation not being available. It is believed to be either due to loss of DC power due to depletion of batteries or to reactor pressure dropping below the level at which it can operate. Operators were unable to restart it as batteries were exhausted. After this, the operators were unable to start the RCIC system and began injecting seawater. Although it was not clear at the time, some of the fuel in Reactor 3 apparently melted around sixty hours after the earthquake (the night of the 12th to 13th). Early on 13 March an official of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) told at a news conference that the emergency cooling system of Unit 3 had failed, spurring an urgent search for a means to supply cooling water to the reactor vessel to prevent a meltdown of its reactor core. At 05:38 there was no means of adding coolant to the reactor, owing to loss of power. Work to restore power and to vent excessive pressure continued. At one point, the top three meters of the uranium/mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods were not covered by coolant. At 07:30 JST, TEPCO prepared to release radioactive steam, indicating that \\"the amount of radiation to be released would be small and not of a level that would affect human health\\" and manual venting took place at 08:41 and 09:20. At 09:25 JST on 13 March, operators began injecting water containing boric acid into the primary containment vessel (PCV) via the pump of a fire truck. When water levels continued to fall and pressure to rise, the injected water was switched to seawater at 13:12. By 15:00 it was noted that despite adding water the level in the reactor did not rise and radiation had increased. A rise was eventually recorded but the level stuck at 2 m below the top of reactor core. Other readings suggested that this could not be the case and the gauge was malfunctioning. Injection of seawater into the primary containment vessel (PCV) was discontinued at 01:10 on 14 March because all the water in the reserve pool had been used up. Supplies were restored by 03:20 and injection of water resumed. On the morning of 15 March, Secretary Edano announced that according to TEPCO, at one location near reactor Units 3 and 4, radiation at an equivalent dose rate of 400 mSv/h was detected. This might have been due to debris from the explosion in Unit 4. =Explosion= At 12:33 JST on 13 March, the chief spokesman of the Japanese government, Yukio Edano said hydrogen gas was building up inside the outer building of Unit 3 just as had occurred in Unit 1, threatening the same kind of explosion. At 11:15 JST on 14 March, the envisaged explosion of the building surrounding Reactor 3 of Fukushima 1 occurred, owing to the ignition of built-up hydrogen gas. The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency of Japan (NISA) reported, as with Unit 1, the top section of the reactor building was blown apart, but the inner containment vessel was not breached. The explosion was larger than that in Unit 1 and felt 40 kilometers away. Pressure readings within the reactor remained steady at around 380 kPa at 11:13 and 360 kPa at 11:55 compared to nominal levels of 400 kPa and a maximum recorded of 840 kPa. Water injection continued. Dose rates of 0.05 mSv/h were recorded in the service hall and of 0.02 mSv/h at the plant entrance. Eleven people were reported injured in the blast. TEPCO and NISA announced that four TEPCO employees, three subcontractor employees, and four Self-Defence-Force soldiers were injured. Six military personnel from the Ground Self Defense Force's Central Nuclear Biological Chemical Weapon Defense Unit, led by Colonel Shinji Iwakuma, had just arrived outside the reactor to spray it with water and were exiting their vehicles when the explosion occurred. Iwakuma later said that TEPCO had not informed them that there was a danger of a hydrogen explosion in the reactor, adding, \\"Tokyo Electric was desperate to stabilize (the plant), so I am not angry at them. If there is a possibility of an explosion, I would be reluctant to send my men there.\\"Kyodo News, \\"GSDF colonel recounts fearing for life in Fukushima reactor blast\\", Japan Times, 7 June 2011, p. 2. =Possibility of criticality in the spent fuel pool= TEPCO claimed that there was a small but non-zero probability that the exposed fuel assemblies in the Unit 4 reactor could reach criticality. The BBC commented that criticality would never mean a nuclear explosion, but could cause a sustained release of radioactive materials. Criticality is usually considered highly unlikely, owing to the low enrichment level used in light water reactors.Wikibooks:Radioactive Waste Management/Spent Nuclear Fuel American nuclear engineer Arnold Gundersen, noting the much greater power and vertical debris ejection compared to the Unit 1 hydrogen blast, has theorized that the Unit 3 explosion involved a prompt criticality in the spent fuel pool material, triggered by the mechanical disruption of an initial, smaller hydrogen gas explosion in the building. On 11 May, TEPCO released underwater robotic video from the spent fuel pool. The video appears to show large amounts of debris contaminating the pool. Based on water samples analysed, unnamed experts and TEPCO reported that the fuel rods were left \\"largely undamaged\\",Underwater robot captures Fukushima wreckage, The Telegraph, 11 May 2011 and that it appears that the Unit 3 explosion was entirely related to hydrogen buildup within the building from venting of the reactor. =Cooling efforts= Around 10:00 JST on 16 March, NHK helicopters flying 30 km away videotaped white fumes rising from the Fukushima I facility. Officials suggested that the Reactor 3 building was the most likely source, and said that its containment systems may have been breached.\\"Japan says 2nd reactor may have ruptured with radioactive release\\", The New York Times 16 March 2010. The control room for Reactors 3 and 4 was evacuated at 10:45 JST but staff were cleared to return and resume water injection into the reactor at 11:30 JST. At 16:12 JST, Self Defence Force (SDF) Chinook helicopters were preparing to pour water on Unit 3, where white fumes rising from the building was believed to be water boiling away from the fuel rod cooling pond on the top floor of the reactor building, and on Unit 4 where the cooling pool was also short of water. The mission was cancelled when helicopter measurements reported radiation levels of 50 mSv. At 21:06 pm JST, the government reported that major damage to Reactor 3 was unlikely but that it nonetheless remained their highest priority. Early on 17 March, TEPCO requested another attempt by the military to put water on the reactor using a helicopter and four helicopter drops of seawater took place around 10:00 JST.Helicopter starts spraying water on Japan nuclear plant Reuters 17 March 2011 The riot police used a water cannon to spray water onto the top of the reactor building and then were replaced by members of the SDF with spray vehicles. On 18 March, a crew of firemen took over the task with six fire engines each spraying 6 tons of water in 40 minutes. 30 further hyper rescue vehicles were involved in spraying operations. Spraying continued each day to 23 March because of concerns the explosion in Unit 3 may have damaged the pool (total 3,742 tonnes of water sprayed up to 22 March) with changing crews to minimise radiation exposure. Lighting in the control room was restored on 22 March after a connection was made to a new grid power supply, and by 24 March it was possible to add 35 tonnes of seawater to the spent fuel pool using the cooling and purification system. On 21 March grey smoke was reported to be rising from the southeast corner of Unit 3 ‚Äì where the spent fuel pool is located. Workers were evacuated from the area. TEPCO claimed no significant change in radiation levels, and the smoke subsided later the same day. On 23 March, black smoke billowed from Unit 3, prompting another evacuation of workers from the plant, though Tokyo Electric Power Co. officials said there had been no corresponding spike in radiation at the plant. \\"We don't know the reason for the smoke\\", Hidehiko Nishiyama of the Nuclear Safety Agency said. On 24 March, three workers entered the basement of the turbine building and were exposed to radiation when they stepped into contaminated water. Two of them were not wearing high boots and received beta ray burns. They were hospitalized, but their injuries were not life-threatening. From 25 March, the source of water being injected into the core was switched from seawater to freshwater. In August, TEPCO began considering changing the core injection method for the no. 3 reactor as it required a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized that this may be because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen to the bottom of the pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes, and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably more effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70‚Äì80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3. =Further developments= Unit 3 reactor temperatures, 19 March to 28 May On 25 March 2011, officials announced the reactor vessel might be breached and leaking radioactive material. High radiation levels from contaminated water prevented work. Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) reiterated concerns about a Unit 3 breach on 30 March. NHK World reported the NISA's concerns as \\"air may be leaking\\", very probably through \\"weakened valves, pipes and openings under the reactors where the control rods are inserted\\", but that \\"there is no indication of large cracks or holes in the reactor vessels\\". As with the other reactors, water was transferred from condenser reservoirs to the suppression pool surge tanks so that condensers could be used to hold radioactive water pumped from the basement. On 17 April, remote control robots were used to enter the Reactor Building and performed a series of inspections. On 27 April, TEPCO revised its estimate of damaged fuel in Unit 3 from 25% to 30%. Radiation measurements of the water in the Unit 3 spent fuel pool were reported at 140 kBq of radioactive caesium-134 per cubic centimeter, 150 kBq of caesium-137 per cubic centimeter, and 11 kBq per cubic centimeter of iodine-131 on 10 May. On 15 May, TEPCO revealed that the pressure vessel that holds nuclear fuel \\"is likely to be damaged and leaking water at Units 2 and 3\\", which meant most of the thousands of tons of water pumped into the reactors had leaked. On 23 May, TEPCO reported that Reactor 3 had suffered a meltdown some sixty hours after the earthquake. On 9 June, staff entered the Reactor Building to conduct radiation surveys. On 25 June and the following day boric acid dissolved in 90 tons of water was pumped into the spent fuel pool of Reactor 3. Concrete debris from the March hydrogen explosion of the reactor building has been detected in the spent fuel pool. In June TEPCO discovered that the water in the pool was strongly alkaline: the pH had reached a value of 11.2. Leaching of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) or calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) from the concrete could have caused this. The alkaline water could accelerate the corrosion of the aluminium racks holding the spent fuel rods. If the fuel assemblies would fall, this could lead to re- criticality. In the meantime preparative works began to install a recirculation cooling system at the fuel pool, that should be operational in the first weeks of July. On 14 July, TEPCO began injecting nitrogen into the containment vessel, which was expected to reduce the likelihood of further hydrogen explosions. On 1 July, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection cooling system to a circulatory cooling system. After 2 July, the Reactor was cooled using fresh water treated by the on-site water treatment plant. On 11 January 2012, radioactively contaminated water was found in two tunnels. On 12 January, TEPCO admitted that around 300 cubic meters of water had accumulated in a tunnel near reactor No.3, with electric cables. Radioactive caesium was measured in concentrations varying from 49 to 69 becquerels per cubic centimeter. Smaller amounts of contaminated water with lower concentrations caesium was found in a tunnel near reactor no.1. How the water could accumulate at these places was under examination.The Mainichi Daily news (13 January 2012) 300 tons of tainted water found near No. 3 unit at Fukushima plant In a study that began two months after the earthquake and tsunami, mutant butterflies were found and are considered a possible reaction to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Some of the butterflies had abnormalities in their legs, antennae, and abdomens, and dents in their eyes. In the morning of 18 July 2013 at 8:20 a.m. (2320 GMT) small amounts of steam escaped from the reactor building. Video images made by a subcontractor, filming the destroyed building and preparing to remove rubble from the place, showed some vapors rising, but it was unclear where it came from. Although there was no change in the afternoon, TEPCO said that radiation levels did not change, and the reactor was still cooled.The Mainichi Shimbun (18 July 2013) TEPCO sees steam but no crisis at nuclear plant According to TEPCO rain could have found its way to the primary containment of the reactor, and because this vessel was still hot, it could cause the steam.The Asahi Shimbun (18 July 2013) Steam rising from reactor building in Fukushima The next day at 7:55 a.m. the steam was gone. Because the radiation levels were too high all work to remove rubble was done by remote control. Operations stopped after the steam was found. According to TEPCO the rain on 17 and 18 July was to blame.The Mainichi Shimbun (19 July 2013) Steam coming out from Fukushima reactor building disappeared: TEPCO On 18 July the actual dosage measurement was 562 millisieverts per hour, therefore the NRA ordered TEPCO to make further investigations. On 23 July at 9:05 the steam was seen again coming out of the fifth floor just above the reactor containment. The night before a rain shower did hit the building, and water might have reached the - 38C - reactor container lid, or might have reached hot fuel left behind in the reactor vessel. At that moment, the ambient temperature was 20.3 C, and the humidity was 91.2 percent. All work removing rubble from the place was halted.The Mainichi Shimbun (23 July 2013) Steam again seen at No. 3 reactor building at Fukushima Daiichi plant , During the last event, radiation levels were measured at 24 locations around the fifth floor of the reactor building. The dosage ranged between 137 millisieverts and 2,170 millisieverts per hour.The Asahi Shimbun (24 July 2013)High radiation levels found near area where steam spotted at Fukushima plant See also * List of civilian nuclear accidents * Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents * Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster * Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents References External links * The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report website in English * Executive summary of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report * Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report - An outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report, as provided by the BBC, 5 July 2012 * Webcam Fukushima nuclear power plant I, Unit 1 through Unit 4 * Investigation Committee on the accidents at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company * Schematic drawing of Unit 1 reactor building * TEPCO News Releases, Tokyo Electric Power Company * NISA Information update, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the nuclear safety authority of Japan * JAIF Information update, Japan Atomic International Forum * JAEA Information update, Japan Atomic Energy Agency * IAEA Update on Japan Earthquake, International Atomic Energy Agency * Nature Journal ‚Äì Specials: Japan earthquake and nuclear crisis * TerraFly Timeline Aerial Imagery of Fukushima Nuclear Reactor after 2011 Tsunami and Earthquake * Documentary photographs: residential damage within \\"No Go\\" Zone * In graphics: Fukushima nuclear alert, as provided by the BBC, 9 July 2012 *PreventionWeb Japan: 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster * \\"What should we learn from the severe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant?\\" by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011 Category:Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ","title":"Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (Unit 3 Reactor)"},{"id":"38378051","text":"Edmund King is a British public relations professional, best known for media appearances on the subject of motorists in his role as President of The Automobile Association.

It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986,\\"Analysis: A month on, Japan nuclear crisis still scarring\\" International Business Times (Australia). 9 April 2011, retrieved 12 April 2011; excerpt, According to James Acton, Associate of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \\"Fukushima is not the worst nuclear accident ever but it is the most complicated and the most dramatic...This was a crisis that played out in real time on TV. Chernobyl did not.\\" and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines. Despite this, there were no deaths caused by acute radiation syndrome. Given the uncertain health effects of low-dose radiation, cancer deaths cannot be ruled out. However, studies by the World Health Organisation and Tokyo University have shown that no discernible increase in the rate of cancer deaths is expected. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged  in the academic literature from none to hundreds. Many deaths are attributed to the evacuation and subsequent long-term displacement caused by mass evacuation that was not necessary for the most part. For evacuation, the estimated number of deaths during and immediately after transit range from 34 to \\"greater than 50\\". The victims include hospital inpatients and elderly people at nursing facilities who died from causes such as hypothermia, deterioration of underlying medical problems, and dehydration. For long-term displacement, many people (mostly sick and elderly) died at an increased rate while in temporary housing and shelters. Degraded living conditions and separation from support networks are likely contributing factors. , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \\"disaster-related deaths\\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. \\"Disaster-related deaths\\" are deaths attributed to disasters and are not caused by direct physical trauma, but does not distinguish between people displaced by the nuclear disaster compared to the earthquake / tsunami. As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1368 have been listed as \\"related to the nuclear power plant\\" according to media analysis. Reports have pointed out that many of these deaths may have been caused by the evacuation period being too long, and that residents could have been allowed to return to their homes earlier in order to reduce the total related death toll. A few of the plant's workers were severely injured or killed by the disaster conditions resulting from the earthquake. Furthermore, at least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 175 (0.7%) have received significant radiation doses. Workers involved in mitigating the effects of the accident do face minimally higher risks for some cancers. One worker is postulated to have died from lung cancer as a radiation induced illness in a Japanese court and the family has got compensation on that ruling.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45423575 BBC News: Fukushima nuclear disaster: Japan confirms first worker death from radiation. However this is based on law and not science. To get lung cancer from the isotopes and concentrations, released under a nuclear accident, is as impossible as it gets, because the isotopes does not build up in the lungs, but get absorbed to the blood stream almost right away, so the lungs does not receive any high dose of radiation, . Besides lung cancer does not develop as fast, that it will cause death a few years after exposure. In people that smoke or have inhaled asbestos it takes decades for the lung cancer to develop and the risk to develop lung cancer is much higher in those cases. The T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima. Summary of events The plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139 As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance. Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.Stricken reactors may get power Sunday, The Wall Street Journal, 19 March 2011 Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.Justin McCurry. Japan raises nuclear alert level to seven. The Guardian. 12 April 2011 The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. Radiation release Experts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30‚Äì50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \\"into the atmosphere in March, 2011 alone.\\" Reports =Japanese government report= On 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on October 12, 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. = UNSCEAR Report = Annex A of the UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee for the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2013 report to the UN General Assembly states that the average effective dose of the 25,000 workers over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 millisieverts (mSv). About 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 35). No radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among the workers and general public exposed to radiation from the accident (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 38). Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30). No discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public or their descendants (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 39). Average annual exposure in the region from naturally occurring sources is about 2.1 mSv, and average lifetime exposure is 170 mSv (Chapter II A(2) paragraph 29). For comparison, the average dose from an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, with and without contrast, is 20 to 30 mSv. = WHO Report = In 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect. The WHO calculations using this model determined that the most at risk group, infants, who were in the most affected area, would experience an absolute increase in the risk of cancer (of all types) during their lifetime, of approximately 1% due to the accident. With the lifetime risk increase for thyroid cancer, due to the accident, for a female infant, in the most affected radiation location, being estimated to be one half of one percent [0.5%]. Cancer risks for the unborn child are considered to be similar to those in 1 year old infants. The estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group - infants. A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently[2013] ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture, this screening programme is, due to the screening effect, likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases. About one third of people [33.3%] in industrialized nations are presently diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes, radiation exposure can increase one's cancer risk, with the cancers that arise being indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes. No increase is expected in the incidence of congenital or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to within the womb radiation exposure. As no radiation induced inherited effects/heritable effects, nor teratogenic effects, have ever been definitely demonstrated in humans, with studies on the health of children conceived by cancer survivors who received radiotherapy, and the children of the Hibakusha, not finding a definitive increase in inherited disease or congenital abnormalities. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants. =Other Reports= Evacuation flight departs Misawa. Major news source reporting at least 2 TEPCO employees confirmed dead from \\"disaster conditions\\" following the earthquake. \\"The two workers, aged 21 and 24, sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss, TEPCO said. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks.\\" A Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster. They found that some deaths were early, during evacuation processes, while other deaths gradually happened after the disaster. The agency found out that the cause of these early deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life. It is stated that the vast majority of people who died during their evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days. The Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone. On 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation. In a nuclear accident situation it is essential for authorities to understand and communicate the direction that contamination is spreading and where it may be deposited on land. Given this information, as well as basic knowledge of the risks of radiation, residents would not feel unnecessary anxiety. The wind measurably increased the radiation levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Radioactive iodine, which can lead to increased risk of thyroid cancer if absorbed into the body, was released into the air along with other fission products. To counteract the radioactive iodine the distribution of potassium iodide is used, as it prevents the absorption of the potentially dangerous radioisotopes of that element. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high. According to the Japanese Government, over 160,000 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health.p. 41, no. 6 of Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.p. 42, no. 2 of In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. Natural radiation levels are higher in some part of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer. , six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. Workers on-site now wear full-body radiation protection gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, but it means they have another enemy: heat. , 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded. In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s have died from heart failure. , there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures. Cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures cannot be ruled out, and according to one expert, might be in the order of 100 cases. A May 2012 United Nations committee report stated that none of the six Fukushima workers who had died since the tsunami had died from radiation exposure.Jiji Press/Associated Press, \\"Radiation didn't cause Fukushima No. 1 deaths: U.N.\\", Japan Times, 25 May 2012, p. 1 According to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \\"disaster-related\\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. A disaster-related death certificate is issued when a death is not directly caused by a tragedy, but by \\"fatigue or the aggravation of a chronic disease due to the disaster\\". According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself. These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life. Finally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial Radiation and Public Health Project which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and infant mortality rates in the United States to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died. Those who have responded to this paper in the literature have noted a number of errors, among them that this figure was based on an assumption of acute deaths from low radiation doses. There is no known mechanism for this, and \\"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\\" and concluded that \\"innumerable factors other than radiation\\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster. The author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979,Mangano, Joseph (2004), \\"Three Mile Island: Health study meltdown\\", Bulletin of the atomic scientists, 60(5), pp.31-35 \\"In Dauphin County, where the Three Mile Island plant is located, the 1979 death rate among infants under one year represented a 28 percent increase over that of 1978, and among infants under one month, the death rate increased by 54 percent.\\" but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. In their final 1981 report, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, examining death rates within the 10-mile area around TMI for the 6 months after the accident, said that the TMI-2 accident did not cause local deaths of infants or fetuses.Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective, Samuel Walker, p234 Another cause of death is the increased number of suicides due to mental stress, despair, anxiety and depression caused by media coverage, and through long periods of evacuation. Perinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in Europe after Chernobyl. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.

In 1522 John Mackay of Strathnaver made a bond to serve Alexander, then Master of Sutherland, as he had served his father.

According to Robert Gordon, Alexander had defeated armed incursions by the Mackays into Sutherland territory. Adam and Elizabeth had fought the Mackays at the Battle of Torran Dubh in 1517. Perhaps in connection with Alexander's marriage to Janet Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl, his parents resigned the Earldom of Sutherland to Alexander in November 1527, and a crown charter to this effect was issued in December.

By a cabinet decision, the Japanese government has approved the use of expression \\"Great East Japan Earthquake\\" in reference to the disaster, including the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, caused by this earthquake. ICANPS(2011) p.19 At the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (Fukushima Daiichi NPS),The power station has six boiling water reactors (BWRs) originally designed by General Electric (GE) and Toshiba. operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the earthquake and tsunami caused the compound accident (hereinafter called Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident) consisting of Station BlackOut (SBO) incident, Unit 1, 2, 3 severe core damage accidents, Unit 1, 2, 4 hydrogen explosion accidents, radioactive releases The Japanese government estimates the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. : In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \\"into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone\\" although it has been said staff may have been told to lie, and give false readings to try and cover up true levels of radiation. : and so on. The accident was initially assessed by Japanese officials as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). Later, the level was raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value. :Justin McCurry. Japan raises nuclear alert level to seven. The Guardian. 12 April 2011 In response to the early events of this accident, Japanese government declared a nuclear emergency situation and established the Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters (NERHQ), which instructed the Fukushima Prefectural Governor and relevant local governments to issue an evacuation order to citizens from the nearby Fukushima Daiichi NPS.ICANPS(2011) p.303 Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30‚Äì50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area.Japan mulls Fukushima food ban: IAEA, Reuters, 19 March 2011 A few of the plant's workers were severely injured or killed by the disaster conditions resulting from the earthquake. There were no immediate deaths due to direct radiation exposures, but at least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged from none to 100 to a non-peer-reviewed \\"guesstimate\\" of 1,000. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. = A process overview of the accident = At the Fukushima Daiichi NPS, all the off-site power supply was lost due to the earthquake. Later, the subsequent arrival of the tsunami caused flooding of many cooling seawater pumps, emergency diesel generators (EDGs), and power panels which were housed in low-lying rooms.Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining Units 1-3 shutdown automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. By the way, Units 1-3 were operating at the time of the accident; Units 4, 5 and 6 were in planned shutdown. IAEA(2015) p.1 This resulted in the total loss of AC power at Unit1 through 5. As nuclear reactor coolant systems stopped for a long time from cutting power, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat producedsmaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting. in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown.F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139 As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened? Investigation Groups ; National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission The National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) was established by the National Diet of Japan as the first independent investigation commission on 8 December 2011.A profile description in the NAIIC top page. On 5 July 2012, NAIIC released an executive summary reportNAIIC_summary(2012) of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident. The panel is due to deliver its final report at the end of July. ; Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company The Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company (ICANPS) was established by the Cabinet decision on 24 May 2011.ICANPS_summary(2011) p.1 On 2 December 2011, ICANPS issued an interim report. On 23 July 2012, the government appointed the committee submitted its final report to the Japanese government. ; TEPCO Internal Investigation On 20 June 2012, TEPCO released its final internal investigation report. In the report, TEPCO complained that top politicians, including the prime minister, interfered with recovery efforts during the initial stages of the disaster by making specific requests that were out of touch with what was actually taking place at the plant. TEPCO concluded that the direct cause of the accident was the tsunami which knocked out the reactors' cooling system. TEPCO also admitted that it was at fault in not being prepared for the situation, but said that its workers did the best they could \\"amid unprecedented circumstances.\\"Nagata, Kazuaki, \\"Tepco lashes prime minister's office\\", Japan Times, 21 June 2012, p. 1 Tepco admitted for the first time on October 12, 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. ; Others As part of the government inquiry, the House of Representatives of Japan's special science committee directed TEPCO to submit to them its manuals and procedures for dealing with reactor accidents. TEPCO responded by submitting manuals with most of the text blotted out. In response, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ordered TEPCO to resubmit the manuals by 28 September 2011 without hiding any of the content. TEPCO replied that it would comply with the order.Jiji Press, \\"Tepco must submit reactor accident manuals without deleted portions\\", Japan Times, 28 September 2011, p. 2. On 24 October NISA published a large portion of Tokyo Electric Power Company's procedural manuals for nuclear accidents. These were the manuals that the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant earlier did send to the Lower House with most of the contents blacked out, saying that this information should be kept secret to protect its intellectual property rights, and that disclosure would offer information to possible terrorists. NISA ordered TEPCO to send the manuals without any redaction, as the law orders. 200 pages were released from the accident procedural manuals used for Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. All their contents were published, only the names of individuals were left out. From these documents could be concluded: * TEPCO did not make sufficient preparations to cope with critical nuclear accidents. * After the batteries and power supply boards were inundated on 11 March, almost all electricity sources were lost * TEPCO did not envision such a power failure or any kind of prolonged power loss. * TEPCO thought that in a serious incident, venting pressure in the reactor containment vessels or carrying out other safety procedures would still be possible, because emergency power sources would still be available. The agency said, the decision to publish the manuals was taken, for transparency in the search what caused the nuclear accident in Fukushima and also to establish better safety measures for the future.NHK-world (24 October 2011) Parts of TEPCO's accident manuals made public. On 24 October 2011 the first meeting was held by a group of 6 nuclear energy specialists invited by NISA to discuss the lessons to be learned from the accidents in Fukushima. Their first remarks were: * Japanese nuclear power plants should have multiple power sources * plants should be able to maintain electricity during an earthquake or other emergencies * TEPCO should examine why the equipment failed to work and should take appropriate actions to prevent such failures in the future On 28 February 2012, the Independent Investigation Commission on the Fukushima Nuclear Accident by the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation announced an investigation report. The Independent Investigation Commission on the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Oregon's United States Senator Ron Wyden toured the plant and issued a statement that the situation was \\"worse than reported.\\" He sent a letter to Japanese Ambassador Ichiro Fujisaki urging Japan to seek international help to relocate spent fuel rods stored in unsound structures and prevent leakage of dangerous nuclear material.Phred Dvorak, Fukushima Daiichi‚Äôs Achilles Heel: Unit 4‚Ä≤s Spent Fuel?, Wall Street Journal, 17 April 2012.

At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a Generation II nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was too late to prevent meltdown.F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139 As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened? Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance. Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.Stricken reactors may get power Sunday, The Wall Street Journal, 19 March 2011 Assessment Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.Justin McCurry. Japan raises nuclear alert level to seven. The Guardian. 12 April 2011 The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. Radioactivity released The Japanese government estimates the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30‚Äì50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants.Japan mulls Fukushima food ban: IAEA, Reuters, 19 March 2011 In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \\"into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone\\". Injuries Several of the plant's workers were severely injured or killed by the disaster conditions resulting from the earthquake. There were no immediate deaths due to direct radiation exposures, but at least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged from none to 100 to a non-peer-reviewed \\"guesstimate\\" of 1,000. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. On 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of causing lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. Accident rating Comparison of radiation levels for different nuclear events. The severity of the nuclear accident is provisionally rated 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). This scale runs from 0, indicating an abnormal situation with no safety consequences, to 7, indicating an accident causing widespread contamination with serious health and environmental effects. Prior to Fukushima, the Chernobyl disaster was the only level 7 accident on record, while the Three Mile Island accident was a level 5 accident. Arnold Gundersen, an engineer frequently commissioned by anti- nuclear groups, said that \\"Fukushima is the biggest industrial catastrophe in the history of mankind\\". However, current estimates of the total amount of radioactivity released from the 3 Fukushima Daiichi reactors is only 10-20% that from Chernobyl. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency initially rated the Unit 1 situation as below both of these previous accidents; on 13 March it announced it was classifying the event as Level 4, an \\"accident with local consequences\\". On 18 March it raised its rating on Units 1, 2 and 3 to Level 5, an \\"accident with wider consequences\\". It classified the situation at Unit 4 as a Level 3 \\"serious incident\\". Several parties disputed the Japanese classifications, arguing that the situation was more severe than they were admitting at the time. On 14 March, three Russian experts stated that the nuclear accident should be classified at Level 5, perhaps even Level 6. One day later, the French nuclear safety authority and the Finnish nuclear safety authority said that the Fukushima plant could be classified as a Level 6. On 24 March, a scientific consultant for anti-nuclear environmental group Greenpeace, working with data from the Austrian ZAMG and French IRSN, prepared an analysis in which he rated the total Fukushima accident at INES level 7. Radiation dose rates during the initial hydrogen explosions. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported on 26 March that the accident might warrant Level 6, based on its calculations. The Wall Street Journal stated that Japan's NISA would make any decision on raising the level. INES Level 6, or \\"serious accident\\", had only been applied to the Kyshtym disaster (Soviet Union, 1957), while the only level 7 was Chernobyl (Soviet Union, 1986). Previous Level 5 accidents included the Windscale fire (United Kingdom, 1957), the Lucens reactor (Switzerland, 1969), Three Mile Island accident (United States, 1979), and the Goi√¢nia accident (Brazil, 1987). Assessing \\"seriousness\\" as partial or full meltdown at a civilian plant, The New York Times reported on 3 April that based on remote sensing, computer \\"simulations suggest that the number of serious accidents has suddenly doubled, with three of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi complex in some stage of meltdown.\\" The Times counted three previous civilian meltdowns, from World Nuclear Association information: Three Mile Island, Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant (France, 1980, INES level 4), and Chernobyl. On 11 April, the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) temporarily raised the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi to Level 7 on the INES scale, by considering the whole event and not considering each reactor as an individual event (each rated between 3 and 5). This would make Fukushima the second Level 7 \\"major accident\\" in the history of the nuclear industry; however, radioactivity released as a result of the events at Fukushima was, as of 12 April, only approximately 10% of that released as a result of the accident at Chernobyl (1986), also rated as INES Level 7. As of 21 October 2011, the largest study on Fukushima fallout concludes that Fukushima was \\"the largest radioactive noble gas release in history not related to nuclear bomb testing. The release is a factor of 2.5 higher than the Chernobyl 133Xe source term\\", although the \\"Xenon-133 [main noble gas] does not pose serious health risks because it is not absorbed by the body or the environment.\\" Xenon does not remain in the atmosphere. As occurred in releases at Three Mile Island, radioactive noble gases rapidly vanish upward, and dissipate into space.http://scitechdaily.com/xenon-gas-has-almost-vanished-from-the- atmosphere/ Arnold Gundersen said Fukushima has 20 times the potential to be released than Chernobyl. Hot spots are being found 60 to 70 kilometres away from the reactor (further away than they were found from Chernobyl), and the amount of radiation in many of them is the amount that caused areas to be declared no-man's-land for Chernobyl. In off-the-record-interviews with Japanese newspapers like the Tokyo Shimbun, former Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan said that there were moments he believed the disaster could have surpassed Chernobyl, many times. At first TEPCO denied that fuel-cores were melted, after all cooling functions were lost. Trade minister Banri Kaieda mentioned that TEPCO seriously considered pulling away all staff members from the plant and leaving it abandoned. Kan could not accept this: \\"Withdrawing from the plant is out of the question.\\" He claimed that \\"If that had happened, Tokyo would be deserted by now. It was a critical moment for Japan's survival. It could have been a led to leaks of dozens of times more radiation than Chernobyl.\\" He said that might have \\"compromised the very existence of the Japanese nation\\". TEPCO's president at that time, Masataka Shimizu, was never clear in his answers, and TEPCO failed to obey the orders to vent one of the overheating reactors. In an interview to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Kan revealed that he went to the plant itself and visually inspected it from above in a helicopter because: \\"I felt I had to go there in person and speak to the people in charge or I would never have known what was going on.\\" Kan said that the American government was seriously concerned about the Japanese response to the accident: \\"We were not told straight out, but it was obvious that they questioned whether we were really taking this seriously.\\" Kan defended his changed attitude to a non-nuclear energy policy, \\"If there is a risk of accidents that could make half the land mass of our country uninhabitable, then we cannot afford to take that risk.\\" See also * List of civilian nuclear accidents * Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents * Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster * Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents References External links * The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report website in English * Executive summary of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report * Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report - An outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report, as provided by the BBC, 5 July 2012 * Webcam Fukushima nuclear power plant I, Unit 1 through Unit 4 * Investigation Committee on the accidents at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company * Schematic drawing of Unit 1 reactor building * TEPCO News Releases, Tokyo Electric Power Company * NISA Information update, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the nuclear safety authority of Japan * JAIF Information update, Japan Atomic International Forum * JAEA Information update, Japan Atomic Energy Agency * IAEA Update on Japan Earthquake, International Atomic Energy Agency * Nature Journal ‚Äì Specials: Japan earthquake and nuclear crisis * TerraFly Timeline Aerial Imagery of Fukushima Nuclear Reactor after 2011 Tsunami and Earthquake * Documentary photographs: residential damage within \\"No Go\\" Zone * In graphics: Fukushima nuclear alert, as provided by the BBC, 9 July 2012 *PreventionWeb Japan: 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster * \\"What should we learn from the severe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant?\\" by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011 Category:Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ","title":"Accident rating of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster"},{"id":"38378327","title":"Whatever It Takes (Leona Lewis song)"},{"id":"38378337","text":"The Classical was a sports website featuring long-form sports articles.

He did not sign and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was then drafted by the Washington Nationals in the first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. Prior to the 2012 season, Baseball America ranked Goodwin as the Nationals fifth best prospect. Goodwin made his debut that year for the Class-A Hagerstown Suns. He was promoted to Double-A Harrisburg Senators after hitting .324/.438/.542 with nine home runs and 38 runs batted in. At Harrisburg he hit .223/.306/.373 with five home runs. After the season, he played in the Arizona Fall League and was the MVP of the Rising Stars Game. Prior to the 2013 season, Goodwin was ranked as the Nationals third best prospect by Baseball America. He was also ranked as the 52nd best prospect in baseball by MLB.com. He was called up to the Nationals in August 2016 after hitting .284 in the minor leagues. On August 10, 2016, Goodwin connected for his first major league hit, a single, against the Cleveland Indians. After starting the 2017 season with the Triple-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, Goodwin was promoted to the majors in May, taking the place of injured outfielder Chris Heisey. Goodwin hit his first major league home run on June 2, 2017, at the Oakland Coliseum, connecting for a two-run shot to right-center off Oakland Athletics relief pitcher Zach Neal, amid a four-hit outburst that marked his best day at the plate in his major league career to that point. On July 27, 2017, Goodwin touched off back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs for the Nationals against Michael Blazek of the Milwaukee Brewers, hitting a two-run shot that scored pitcher Max Scherzer from first base to begin the onslaught.

His ancestral home was Suncheon (È†ÜÂ§©).He was also known under the names Gukgyeong(ÂúãÂçø) and Jeoljae(ÁØÄÈΩã), and his posthumous name is Chungik(Âø†Áøº). In 1405, he passed the state examination and became a rank 13 official. He served King Sejong the Great as a general during the campaign against the Jurchens. In 1453, he was assassinated on the order of Prince Suyang along with his two sons. His tomb is located near Sejong City. Biography =Early life= Kim Jong-Seo was born in 1383 in Yanggwang-do, Gongju as the son of Kim Su(ÈáëÈåò), and a lady from the Bae clan. He was the second of 3 brothers. All three siblings achieved successful political careers: his older brother Kim Jonghan(ÈáëÂÆóÊº¢) was a high-ranking official, and his younger brother Kim Jongheung(ÈáëÂÆóËàà) was the magistrate of Yangju. =Career= He passed the state examination in 1405 and in 1411 he was posted as a royal inspector to Gangwon Province. In 1433, he was sent by King Sejong the Great to conquer the Manchu. Kim's military campaign captured several castles, pushed north, and restored Korean territory roughly to the present-day border between North Korea and China.Reference 1 Î∞ïÏòÅÍ∑ú (2008).

Since the times of the Goryeo Dynasty, they have been conciliatory efforts through trade as well as attempted suppression of the raiders by force, but the border conflicts did not cease. Early in the Joseon Dynasty, the northern part of Yeongbyeon county was lost to the Jurchen invaders. To solve the issue once for all, in 1433, King Sejong sent General Choi Yun-deok to suppress the Yeren in the Yalu River Basin. In October of the same year, Kim Jong-seo led another expedition to the northern part of Hamgyeong province, where he defeated the Jurchens and strengthened the borders against future attacks. =Later life and death= Following King Sejong's death, Grand Prince Suyang's ill brother, Munjong took the throne but soon died. The crown passed to his 12-year-old son, Danjong. The new king was too young to rule the nation and all political processes were controlled by then-Chief State Councilor Hwangbo In and General Kim Jongseo. As Kim Jongseo and his faction, which included Danjong's guardian Princess Gyeonghye, used the chance to extend the power of court officials against many royal family members, the tension between Kim and Suyang greatly increased; not only Suyang himself, but his younger brother, Grand Prince Anpyeong, also sought an opportunity to take control of the kingdom. Suyang surrounded himself with trusted allies, including his famous adviser, Han Myung-hoi. Han advised Suyang to take over the government in a coup, and in October 1453, he killed Kim Jongseo and his faction, thereby taking the reins of power into his own hands. After the coup he arrested his own brother, Anpyong, first sending him into exile, then putting him to death.

The bill was introduced to establish the Food Desert Oasis Pilot Program, intended to combat food deserts. A food desert defined by the United States Department of Agriculture's Healthy Food Financing Initiative working group, is a \\"low income census tract where a substantial number of\\\\r share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store.\\" The bill identifies several US cities as food deserts, defines a qualified food desert business, grants certain tax benefits for those designated food deserts, amends the Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 and directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report on the health of such communities. The bill did not come to a vote and did not become law, but other federal initiatives have been created to address food deserts. Sections ;Title I Section 101 of the Food Desert Oasis Act lists 20 cities as food desert zones. It defines qualified food desert businesses as any wholesale or retail business whose gross sales are at least 25% gained from the sale of fresh fruits and vegetables. Section 102 of the Food Desert Oasis Act increases the tax credits a qualified food desert business can claim for the rehabilitation of a structure in a food desert. Section 103 of the Food Desert Oasis Act designates food deserts as empowerment zones for tax purposes, allowing employers of qualified food deserts to seek employment tax credits. Section 104 of the Food Desert Oasis Act determines that states with designated food deserts are eligible for tax exempt bond financing to acquire, construct or rehabilitate commercial property located in a food desert for the use of a qualified food desert business. ;Title II Section 201 amends and expands the Food Conservation Act of 2008, specifically the section dealing with the Hunger Free Communities Program. The bill would expand the federal government's fiscal responsibility to shoulder 100% of the costs associated with any activity in an identified food desert under the Hunger Free Communities Program in the years 2010 through 2015. The bill amends the time frame of appropriations for the Hunger Free Communities Program from 2012 to 2015. ;Title III Section 301 of the Food Desert Oasis Act instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to congress no later than December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2016 on changes in the health of the residents of designated food desert zones. In addition the Secretary of the Treasury must report to congress the effect Title I (sections 101, 102, 103 and 104) on the amount of investments by private business in food desert zones.

Beginning on March 31, 1919, a force of British, American, Polish, and White Russian troops engaged several Red Army partisan regiments at the village of Bolshie Ozerki. Although the initial Allied attacks were repelled, the outnumbered Allies managed to repel the Soviet flanking attempts that followed and the Red Army was later ordered to withdraw. Allied forces began to withdraw rapidly from northern Russia shortly thereafter. The battle was the last engagement of British forces in the intervention. It was also one of the last significant engagements to involve American forces. Two months later, American forces of the Siberian Intervention successfully defended their camp from a Red attack at Romanovka by forces that greatly outnumbered them. The following month, they inflicted hundreds of casualties during the Suchan Valley Campaign.  Background  Bolshie Ozerki was a small village situated between the port city of Onega and an important Allied position at Obozerskaya Station, along the Arkhangelsk-Vologda railroad. Because the port of the main Allied base at Arkhangelsk froze every winter, reinforcements had to be brought overland to the front line from the port of Murmansk, which did not freeze. The road linking Murmansk to Obozerskaya ran through Bolshie Ozerki, so when the British 6th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment (\\"Green Howards\\") was dispatched to the front, the Red Army decided to seize the village in order to prevent the British column from reaching Obozerskaya. After destroying the British column and taking control of the railroad, the Red Army would then proceed by clearing the way to Arkhangelsk, which would then be taken. Several skirmishes occurred at Bolshie Ozerki immediately before the main battle, which began on March 31. The first occurred on March 17, when a Red Army ski detachment led by Osip Palkin reconnoitered the village's defenses. Stealthily, the Reds captured two sentries and learned the precise locations of the Allied positions. Armed with this information, Commander Petr A. Solodukhin's brigade of 600 to 800 men attacked and overwhelmed between 80 and 160 French and White Russian troops garrisoning the village, capturing the outpost intact. On the following day the Allies launched an abortive counterattack. The 6th Red Army commander, Major General Aleksandr Samoilo, ordered his men to cease all offensive operations on the same day, citing shortages of warm gear and other necessities, the tenuous hold Commander Solodukhin (who had not captured every building) had on the village, and reports of troops in other sectors being frozen to death or frostbitten by bitter -30 ¬∞C (-22 ¬∞F) temperatures. Samoilo issued orders for the 6th Army to resume offensive operations on March 25, but the Red Army commander-in-chief, Colonel Ioakim I. Vatsetis, countermanded it \\"because of the severe frost.\\" On March 23, about 320 British soldiers from the 6th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment and 70 American troops from Company H, 339th Infantry Regiment launched coordinated attacks on Bolshie Ozerki from positions west of the village. Waist-deep snow, which prevented the Allies from charging, and heavy enemy machine gun fire repulsed the attack. Simultaneously, 300 White Russians and between 40 and 80 British soldiers assaulted the eastern approaches along the road, also foundering in the face of effective enemy withering fire. Company E, 339th Infantry attempted to flank the enemy defenses by skirting through the forest north of the road. However, the movement required the unit to cover three miles of snow-covered forest in four hours time. Exhausted from already marching ten miles and hampered by awkward Shackleton boots (canvas and leather footwear with smooth soles and low heels designed by the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, they were extremely slippery on ice or packed snow and generally considered inferior to the natives' felt boots by the Allies), the Americans failed to traverse the forest in time and were ordered to return. The Allies lost about 75 men as result of the two attacks. General Edmund Ironside, who had personally taken command in the sector, ordered an artillery bombardment of Bolshie Ozerki. With the village mostly destroyed by March 25, General Ironside returned to Arkhangelsk. Despite the weather, both sides continued to bring up reinforcements. The Allies constructed a series of wooden blockhouses, log barricades, and troop shelters at a site about 4 miles east of the village on the road to Obozerskaya, which was 12 miles further east. By the end of March, the Allies had brought up all of their available artillery from their railroad, mostly consisting of 75 mm guns manned by White Russians. They also concentrated all available troops from Arkhangelsk and other sectors, including Companies E, I, and M of the 339th Infantry Regiment, three White Russian companies (three infantry, one machine gun), two Yorkshire platoons, and one invaluable section from the US 310th Engineers. The Allied force, totaling less than 2,000 soldiers, faced an estimated 7,000 Red Army troops drawn from the 2nd Moscow Regiment, the 9th Saratov Regiment, and a Kamyshin brigade, possibly from Commander Fyodor Kuznetsov's Kamyshinsk Division. A Soviet artillery battery of 4.2-inch guns had been hauled into position over 37 miles at the cost of uncounted dead horses. Battle The Battle of Bolshie Ozerki (March 31 - April 2, 1919). At about 8:30 AM on the morning of March 31, 1919, the elements of the Red Army cut the telephone lines between Obozerskaya and the Allied positions along the road. Three battalions of the 2nd Moscow Regiment then flanked the Allies from the north and attempted to capture two 75 mm guns. Lieutenant Kukovsky, the White Russian responsible for these guns, reversed them in time to fire four shrapnel rounds into the Reds at point-blank range. The effective fire from the Lewis gun team under Corporal Pratt, Company M, 339th Infantry, halted the Muscovites with heavy losses. Fighting then shifted to frontal positions as the Red Army launched repeated attacks from Bolshie Ozerki throughout the day. Combined with the added toll inflicted by Allied artillery, devastating fire from the forward blockhouse and front line positions drove back every Soviet attack until nightfall. The main Red Army assault began at about 3:30 AM on April 1, shortly after daybreak, with determined frontal attacks and a weaker demonstration at the Allies' rear. Again, all Soviet attacks were driven back by machine gun, rifle, and artillery fire. At times, rifle grenades were employed when Soviet troops came within their 200-yard range. Several Soviet deserters revealed demoralization within Red units, reporting that an entire company of the 97th Saratov Regiment had refused to advance. Despite this, Allied launched a diversionary attack against on the village from the west in order to relieve the pressure on heavily engaged Allied units to the east. The Allies had planned the diversionary attack for 3:00 AM on April 2, 1919. Lieutenant Marsh, leading Company C of the Yorkshires, accompanied by White Russian guides would move along a forest trail that had been recently reconnoitered by a White Russian officer. Company A, Yorkshires, under Captain Bailey would advance along another trail blazed about a week earlier, protected on its right flank by a detachment moving along the main road leading into the village from the northwest. Along with part of a White Russian machine gun company, an American trench mortar detachment and machine gun team from Company H, 339th Infantry would also assist Captain Bailey, providing two infantry platoons for a reserve. A Polish company would advance along the main road and deploy south of the road upon contact with the enemy. The attack was, however, no more successful than the concurrent Red Army offensive. Lieutenant Marsh reported at 2:00 AM that his company was lost, his horses were belly-deep in the snow, and that he could not proceed, thus neutralizing a main element in the attack until it returned to the main road, far from its objective, at 5:10 AM. The Poles had suffered heavy casualties by this time, forcing them to withdraw temporarily. Company A was partially surrounded at 6:10 AM and forced to yield ground. Lieutenant Goodloss assumed command when Captain Bailey was killed and subsequently ordered a retreat. Lieutenant Clifford F. Phillips, leading a platoon from Company H, 339th Infantry, rushed up from the reserves to cover the British retreat. Lt. Phillips was also mortally wounded in this subsequent delaying action, repelling enemy counterattacks for an hour with a few men and 2 Lewis guns until reinforcements arrived. The citation for his posthumous receipt of the Distinguished Service Cross for bravery reads as follows: Artillery and mortar exchanges ensued throughout the remainder of the day until a successful Allied counterattack occurred at 5:30 PM in response to Soviet pressure on both flanks. The Bolsheviks disengaged at 7:00 PM and roughly an hour later, the Allies withdrew under cover of darkness to nearby quarters in settlements in the rear. Many soldiers suffered from exhaustion and severe frostbite. A heavy Soviet artillery and mortar barrage east of Bolshie Ozerki was met by an Allied counter-barrage on April 2. By noon, even weak infantry attacks had effectively ended. No more attacks followed, and by April 5 the Soviets withdrew from the area as further delay would have risked the loss or immobilization of guns and sleighs in spring mud. The Allies began evacuation from Arkhangelsk immediately after the thaw of ice. Aftermath Men of the American 339th Infantry Regiment in northern Russia. The fierce engagements at the turn of the month were the last major battles of the campaign in northern Russia. The Allies temporarily checked Soviet forces, defending their road positions, but did not succeed in budging them from their defenses at Bolshie Ozerki. Both sides suffered heavily from exposure despite sunny days and nighttime temperatures that did not fall below -20 ¬∞C (-4 ¬∞F). Sunshine melted snow which soaked through the canvas tops of Allied Shackleton boots, causing more cases of frostbite than even the coldest days of winter and conditions below -40 ¬∞C (-40 ¬∞F). A Soviet source acknowledged 500 frostbite casualties in the Kamyshin brigade alone, which was recklessly committed from the milder climate of the southern Volga region before receiving proper winter clothing, such as felt boots and sheepskin coats. The deployment of thousands of Soviet troops in the open for days on end condemned many to frostbite or death by freezing. In light of these facts, the Allied estimates of 2,000 Bolshevik casualties from all causes may have conservatively erred. At least 10 members of the Yorkshire Regiment died during the April 1919 fighting. In mid-April 17, Brigadier General Wilds P. Richardson arrived in Arkhangelsk after a personal briefing from President Woodrow Wilson to take charge of the evacuation of U.S. forces from North Russia. As the phased withdrawal from fighting fronts to bases in and around Arkhangelsk continued through the following months, operational control of the theater shifted to the White Army under the command of Governor-General Yevgeny-Ludvug Karlovich Miller.

He spent roughly a year in the region, enough time to initiate manufacturing and turning over management of the factory to his son, Alcander. Later, Hutchinson returned to the United States, where he conducted research on other applications of rubber, which he (correctly) predicted would be useful for a variety of products, including tires, boots, and sealant, all of which are now manufactured by Hutchinson SA. Despite undergoing corporate restructuring on more than one occasion, Hutchinson's company still operates the original plant at Ch√¢lette-sur-Loing.

The public frequently convey, especially to researchers or pollsters, preferences that differ from what they truly want, often because they believe the conveyed preference is more acceptable socially. The idea of preference falsification was put forth by the social scientist Timur Kuran in his 1995 book Private Truth, Public Lies as part of his theory of how people's stated preferences are responsive to social influences. It laid the foundation for his theory of why unanticipated revolutions can occur. The concept is related to ideas of social proof as well as choice blindness. Original formulation According to the theory, when articulating preferences individuals frequently tailor their choices to what appears socially acceptable. In other words, they convey preferences that differ from what they genuinely want. Kuran calls the resulting misrepresentation \\"preference falsification\\". In his 1995 book, Private Truths, Public Lies, he argues that the phenomenon is ubiquitous and that it has huge social and political consequences. These consequences all hinge on interdependencies between individuals' decisions as to what preference to convey publicly. A person who hides his discontent about a fashion, policy, or political regime makes it harder for others to express discontent. One socially significant consequence of preference falsification is widespread public support for social options that would be rejected decisively in a vote taken by secret ballot. Privately unpopular policies may be retained indefinitely as people reproduce conformist social pressures through individual acts of preference falsification. In falsifying preferences, people hide the knowledge on which their true preferences rest. In the process, they distort, corrupt, and impoverish the knowledge in the public domain. They make it harder for others to become informed about the drawbacks of existing arrangements and the merits of their alternatives. Another consequence of preference falsification is thus widespread ignorance about the advantages of change. Over long periods, preference falsification can dampen a community's capacity to want change by bringing about intellectual narrowness and ossification. The first of these consequences is driven by people's need for social approval, the second by their reliance on each other for information. Kuran has applied these observations to a range of contexts. He has used the theory developed in Private Truths, Public Lies to explain why major political revolutions catch us by surprise, how ethnic tensions can feed on themselves, why India's caste system has been a powerful social force for millennia, and why minor risks sometimes generate mass hysteria.Kuran, Timur, Private Truths, Public Lies, (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1995). Academic research Kuran has published a number of papers on the themes of preference falsification (his book Private Truth, Public Lies is based on these papers). The idea of preference falsification has been studied by a number of social scientists. Economist Robert H. Frank reviewed Timur Kuran's book and offered his own thoughts on the political economy of preference falsification. William Davis considered preference falsification within the economics profession. According to a 2020 study, the vast majority of young married men in Saudi Arabia express private beliefs in support of women working outside the home but they substantially underestimate the degree to which other similar men support it. Once they become informed about the widespread nature of the support, they increasingly help their wives obtain jobs.

It resulted in the regional municipality's current boundaries.  First Amalgamation  The current boundaries of Halifax County were established in 1908. Owing to the need for a more efficient county-wide government, the Municipality of the County of Halifax was incorporated in 1962, including all areas in the county outside of the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth. The City of Halifax gradually grew to occupy the entire Halifax Peninsula by the end of World War II. The late 1960s was a period of significant change and expansion of the city when surrounding areas of Halifax County were amalgamated into Halifax: Rockingham, Clayton Park, Fairview, Armdale, and Spryfield were all added in 1969. The biggest change to Dartmouth came in 1955 when the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge opened, connecting Dartmouth to Halifax. Unprecedented suburban growth led In 1961 the communities of Woodlawn, Woodside and Westphal along with the area of the town of Dartmouth joined together to become the \\"City Of Dartmouth\\" the city was the third largest city in Nova Scotia, after Halifax and Sydney. The A. Murray MacKay Bridge opened in 1970, furthering growth and leading to the economic integration of what many were terming Nova Scotia's \\"twin cities\\". Bedford was organized as an unincorporated rural community in 1921 and underwent rapid suburban growth during the post-war years. One of the largest unincorporated municipalities in Nova Scotia by the 1970s, Bedford incorporated as the Town of Bedford in 1980.  Second Amalgamation  =Precursor to amalgamation= In 1993, the Conservative provincial government of Nova Scotia began to consider merging the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth with the town of Bedford and Halifax County. Halifax, Dartmouth and Bedford were relatively densely populated while Halifax County was largely rural with large areas of wilderness. Amalgamating these regions had been proposed as far back as 1974. Bill Hayward, a consultant, was hired by the government of premier Don Cameron to prepare a report on the potential savings resulting from the merger of municipalities in Halifax County and Cape Breton County. Before the report was completed, Cameron's party was defeated in a provincial general election and a former mayor of Dartmouth, Dr. John Savage won the election. Savage had previously declared his opposition to regional amalgamations, but he relented and his administration backed the creation of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality in August 1995 to solve a funding and demographic short-fall facing several communities in Cape Breton County. The merger was controversial but appeared to achieve the predicted economic goals in the short-term so Savage's government opted to proceed with the Halifax County merger; Bill Hayward was retained to oversee the process on behalf of the government. Hayward's report had predicted that a regional amalgamation in Halifax County would save over $20 million annually, through reductions in duplicate services and by eliminating duplicate high-level administrative positions for the population of 350,000. Many residents in Halifax County municipalities were against the merger with rural areas tending to generate the most opposition; those residents feared that they would be forced to pay higher taxes and follow urban standards without receiving a higher level of municipal services. Hayward's predicted cost savings were widely criticised as unrealistic, with many feeling that he had arbitrarily determined the figures. Politicians were equally divided on the merger, as many saw the influence of their local constituencies being reduced in a larger municipality, which would be dominated by the former cities of Halifax and Dartmouth. The actual public debate over the planned amalgamation was fairly muted, with a few sparsely- attended public information sessions and some discussion in various media. The prevailing attitude among residents and outside observers was that amalgamation would be inevitable and could not be stopped. The New Democratic Party call unsuccessfully for a plebiscite on the matter. = Incorporation = In 1995, an Act to Incorporate the Halifax Regional Municipality received Royal Assent in the provincial legislature and the Halifax Regional Municipality was established on April 1, 1996, the same day all former municipalities were dissolved. In 1996 the provincial government amalgamated all municipal governments within Halifax County to create HRM, a regional municipality comprising approximately 200 individual communities or placenames for civic addressing grouped into eighteen planning areas for zoning purposes. It is one of the newest municipalities in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, in terms of incorporation. It was formed on April 1, 1996, by dissolving and amalgamating the following municipalities: * City of Halifax * City of Dartmouth * Town of Bedford * Municipality of the County of Halifax All municipal services and staff were merged into the new municipal unit. The awkward name of the municipality was quickly shortened by media, residents and politicians to the informal \\"HRM,\\" which is commonly heard. With the creation of HRM, the Municipality of the County of Halifax was officially dissolved, however the geographic division of Halifax County continues to exist and the boundaries of HRM are contiguous with the county, except for several First Nations reserves. The provincial government designated the area occupied by the former Cities of Halifax and Dartmouth as the Halifax Metropolitan Area, and the area occupied by the former Town of Bedford as the Bedford (Urban Community). =Aftermath of amalgamation= Several problems with the amalgamation were noted, with the most obvious being that many of the predicted cost savings did not materialize. Some savings to be achieved by eliminating duplicate jobs were offset by the fact that staff from rural areas now demanded to paid at the same rate as their urban counterparts, forcing the cost for amalgamation to double from initial estimates. Small scandals such as the purchase of $1,000 chairs for the new Halifax Regional Council cast a negative light on the process, and unflattering articles in the national media portrayed the Halifax amalgamation as an example of how not to merge municipalities. Halifax was repeatedly referenced as a scenario to avoid when the Government of Ontario was looking at amalgamating municipalities in the Greater Toronto Area during the late 1990s. Since amalgamation, the municipality has experienced dramatic growth and prosperity, mainly resulting from HRM benefiting from a much-delayed urban growth in Atlantic Canada ‚Äì this being one of the last regions in North America to urbanize. Critics have pointed out that the majority of economic development has benefited the former cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, with many rural areas of HRM continuing to experience economic stagnation and decline. The term Haligonian refers specifically to residents of the former City of Halifax. Since amalgamation, there have been attempts to apply the term more broadly to all residents of HRM, however the majority of citizens in Dartmouth, Bedford and other communities in the municipality tend to avoid its use. Despite amalgamation, residents of the municipality, maps, (and Canada Post) still refer to the names of the pre-amalgamation municipalities when describing the geographic area and when referring to their specific groupings of citizens. In 2004, there was some discussion in the Eastern Shore area of applying to the province of Nova Scotia to form their own municipality. This was due to the perceived lack of services to and representation from this part of HRM.

He previously played for the San Francisco Giants, for whom he made his MLB debut in 2017. Career =High School career= Crick attended Sherman High School in Sherman, Texas. He played for the school's baseball team as a first baseman and third baseman, and only occasionally as a pitcher. He became a full-time pitcher in his senior year, and he had a 7‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and a 1.11 earned run average (ERA) with 95 strikeouts. Crick committed to attend Texas Christian University (TCU) to play college baseball for the TCU Horned Frogs. =San Francisco Giants= The San Francisco Giants selected Crick in the first round, with the 49th overall selection, of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. Citing arm injuries suffered by TCU pitchers, Crick opted to sign with the Giants rather than attend college. He received a $900,000 signing bonus. After signing, he made his professional debut that year with the AZL Giants of the Rookie League Arizona Fall League, going 1‚Äì0 with a 6.43 ERA in seven relief innings pitched. Crick pitched to a 7‚Äì6 record and 2.51 ERA with 128 strikeouts in innings pitched in 23 games (22 starts) for the Augusta GreenJackets of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2012. Prior to the 2013 season, Baseball America ranked Crick as the Giants' best prospect. He was also ranked as the 86th best prospect in baseball by MLB.com. He pitched for the San Jose Giants of the Class A-Advanced California League in 2013, and was the Giants' lone representative in the All-Star Futures Game. Crick pitched to a 3‚Äì1 record and a 1.57 ERA with 95 strikeouts in innings pitched in 14 starts for San Jose. He missed two months of the season with an oblique injury, and was assigned to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League to make up for missed innings. He earned comparisons to Giants pitcher Matt Cain. Before the 2014 season, MLB.com ranked him as the 32nd best prospect in all of baseball, jumping 54 spots from his previous ranking of 89th overall in 2013. He was also ranked by Baseball America as the 33rd best prospect in baseball.2014 Baseball America Top 100 Prospects: The 25th Edition/ Crick pitched for the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League in 2014, compiling a 6‚Äì7 record and 3.79 ERA in 23 games (22 starts). Crick returned to Richmond in 2015, and struggled with his control, walking 66 batters in 63 innings pitched. He was removed from the starting rotation and used as a relief pitcher. In 36 games (11 starts) for Richmond, he was 3‚Äì4 with a 3.29 ERA and 1.79 WHIP. After the 2015 season, the Giants added Crick to their 40-man roster to protect him from being eligible for selection in the Rule 5 draft. Crick returned to Richmond in 2016 as a starting pitcher. In 23 starts, he pitched to a 4‚Äì11 record and a 5.04 ERA. After a strong performance in spring training in 2017, he was assigned to the Sacramento River Cats of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League to begin the season. As a relief pitcher, he had a 1‚Äì2 record and a 2.76 ERA in innings pitched across 24 appearances, with 39 strikeouts. On June 20, the Giants promoted Crick to the major leagues as a middle reliever. He made his major league debut on June 22. Crick remained with the Giants for the remainder of the season and had a 3.06 ERA in major league innings, striking out 28 and allowing 17 walks. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On January 15, 2018, the Giants traded Crick, Bryan Reynolds and $500,000 of international bonus slot money to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Andrew McCutchen and cash considerations. Crick began the 2018 season with the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA International League, and was promoted to the Pirates on April 13. Crick spent the entire season pitching out of the bullpen, leading the team in ERA with a 2.39 ERA in 64 games. He struck out 65 batters in innings. Crick had a 4.96 ERA in 52 games for Pittsburgh in 2019. On September 10, Crick and Felipe V√°zquez got into a clubhouse fight. Crick broke his finger, requiring season-ending surgery on the tendon. Personal life Crick has a fraternal twin named Kevin.

Born in Middlesbrough, Miller played for local youth team South Bank Casuals, scoring 42 goals as centre forward in the 1934‚àí35 season. He signed for Middlesbrough a couple of seasons later but failed to make a first team league appearance. His career was interrupted by the Second World War. Miller was drafted into the RAF in 1940 as a PTI (Physical Training Instructor) and spent two years training servicemen in Canada. On returning to England he was stationed at various RAF bases and guested for local league teams when league football resumed. A subsequent move to Wolverhampton Wanderers gained him three League games before a serious leg muscle injury sidelined him for a season. A move to Derby County brought him a single appearance in half a season. Doncaster were having a surprisingly bad season and were wanting to make improvements, so they brought Miller to Belle Vue in January 1948. In his 5 1/2 seasons there he helped them win the Division 3 North title and sustain their place in Division 2. He made 146 appearances, scored 4 goals, and had a spell as captain. He left to Aldershot in March 1953. At the end of the season with the 'Shots, he transferred to Boston United. Whilst there he was a regular feature, clocking up 192 games and 15 goals.

Discovery and naming Metacarpal four In 2009, M√°ty√°s Vremir at LancrƒÉm near Sebe≈ü-Glod in Transylvania at the SbG-B site uncovered the remains of a pterosaur. He donated these to the Erd√©lyi M√∫zeum, of the SocietƒÉ»õii Muzeului Ardelean (Transylvanian Museum Society). Subsequent excavations by Vremir discovered additional bones of the same individual animal and were added by him to the collection of the Babe»ô-Bolyai University. In 2013, Vremir, Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner, Darren Naish, and Gareth Dyke named and described the type species Eurazhdarcho langendorfensis. The generic name combines the name of Europe with that of the related form Azhdarcho. The specific name refers to Langendorf, the name of Lancr«ém in the language of the German ethnic minority in Romania. The article appeared in the electronic journal PLoS ONE without an accompanying printed version; it nevertheless validly names the taxon under the new rules of the ICZN. The holotype, EME VP 312, was found in a layer of the Sebe≈ü Formation dating from the upper Early Maastrichtian, about 69 million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It includes three neck vertebrae among which the almost complete third and the fourth; the third and fourth right metacarpal; the upper part of the first phalanx of the wing finger; the lower part of the second phalanx; a lower phalanx of one of the other fingers and a number of undetermined fragments. The Babe»ô-Bolyai University material is included within this enumeration and is not indicated by a separate inventory number. Generally the quality of the bones is poor with much of the outer cortex broken or eroded and internal structures present as (impressions of) natural moulds. The fossils have not been completely flattened, preserving three-dimensionality, but compression has caused some distortion. The carcass had probably by flooding been deposed on its back in mud near a riverbank. Afterwards it was exposed to the air, weathering and being scavenged as proven by circular bite-marks inflicted by the conical teeth of some member of the Crocodyliformes. Later covered by a thin layer of dirt, it was damaged by beetles and termites. The authors noted that from the same Romanian layers the related giant form Hatzegopteryx is known; the known fossil material from both genera does not overlap. The authors considered an identity to be unlikely because the much smaller EME VP 312 seems to represent an adult individual. Description Silhouette restoration showing known remains Life restoration Eurazhdarcho is a medium- sized azhdarchid. The authors estimated its wingspan at , extrapolating from an estimated length for the fourth metacarpal of about . The authors established some distinctive traits, all present in the cervical vertebrae. The third neck vertebra has three-quarters of the length of the fourth vertebra, whereas 60 percent would be normal with azhdarchids. The necks of the prezygapophyses, the front joint processes, are well-developed and elongated, obliquely pointing forwards and outwards under an angle of 30 degrees with the long axis of the vertebra. The preexapophysis, a secondary joint process on the side of the prezygapophysis, is well-developed with a forward pointing articulation facet and separated from a process, itself the remains of the diapophysis and possibly a neck rib, on the outer base of the prezygapophysis, by a deep trough on its underside. The pneumatic openings, the entrance holes for the air sacks, at the sides of the neural arch are small and placed in a low position. Phylogeny Eurazhdarcho was by the authors assigned to the Azhdarchidae, based on the method of comparative anatomy; a cladistic analysis was not performed. In 2018 however, Nicholas Longrich and colleagues included Eurazhdarcho in a large phylogenetic analysis of the Pterosauria, where it was recovered within the family Azhdarchidae.Nicholas R. Longrich; David M. Martill; Brian Andres (2018). \\"Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary\\". PLOS Biology. 16 (3): e2001663. Their cladogram is presented below: Paleobiology Cervical vertebra three The area where Eurazhdarcho was found, in the Upper Cretaceous was localized on the Ha»õeg Island, part of the European Archipelago. The SbG-B site, though encompassing a surface of just 200 m¬≥, has yielded several distinct animal species among which the turtle Kallokibotion bajazidi, the hadrosaur Telmatosaurus and a form referred to the titanosaur Magyarosaurus. This terrestrial fauna suggests that Eurazdarcho was not a coastal piscivore catching fish on the wing, affirming the \\"superstork\\" model for azhdarchids, in which they are terrestrial stalkers snatching small prey animals while walking on all fours. Map of azhdarchid sites with size distinction If Eurazhdarcho was indeed distinct from Hatzegopteryx, its discovery implies the presence of two azhdarchid forms in the Ha»õeg fauna, the one gigantic, the other medium-sized. This suggests a niche partitioning between them, although it is as yet unclear how this correlates with differences in prey preference and hunting techniques. This reflects a pattern seen in other Late Cretaceous faunae which also show a combination of a large azhdarchid species with a smaller one. The Javelina Formation from the Maastrichtian of Texas has brought forth the giant Quetzalcoatlus northropi but also a smaller Quetzalcoatlus sp. and the azhdarchoid represented by specimen TMM 42489-2. The Two Medicine Formation fauna from the Campanian of Montana includes the smaller Montanazhdarcho minor, with a wingspan of , but also fragments of larger forms with a span of . In the coeval Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada the smaller specimen RTMP 92.83 was discovered with a wingspan of but also the large specimen PMA P.80.16.1367 indicating a wingspan of about wide.

In reality, Cabell was one of Congress' biggest supporters of slavery, and was one of the spearheads behind the Compromise of 1850. Cabell also refused to support the Whig candidate for president, General Winfield Scott, as Scott was perceived to be a trojan horse for abolitionism among many Southern Whigs, most of whom supported President Millard Fillmore at the 1852 Whig National Convention.

College career After graduating from Tupelo High School, Stratton attended Mississippi State University from 2010 to 2012. In 2011, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. As a senior, he was a consensus All-American after going 11‚Äì2 with a 2.38 earned run average and 127 strikeouts. He was also the SEC Pitcher of the Year. He also won the C Spire Ferriss Trophy as Mississippi's top collegiate baseball player. Professional career =San Francisco Giants= Stratton was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. In August, he was hospitalized after a line drive struck him in the head. Before the 2013 season, Baseball America ranked Stratton as the Giants' third best prospect. The Giants added him to their 40-man roster after the 2015 season. Stratton was called up from the Sacramento River Cats (AAA-Pacific Coast League) to the majors on May 28, 2016, to replace the injured Matt Cain. Despite being primarily a starter in the minors, the Giants added Stratton to their bullpen and he made his major league debut against the Atlanta Braves on May 30, pitching a scoreless bottom of the eighth inning and recording two strikeouts while retiring all three batters he faced. On June 11, he was credited with his first major league win as he pitched the top of the 10th inning in the Giants victory against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On June 13 he was sent down again when Cain returned from the DL, but was recalled from the minors the following day when Cain was put back on the DL with a reinjured hamstring. Stratton pitched in seven games for the Giants with a 1-0 record and a 3.60 ERA. He compiled a 12-6 record and a 3.87 ERA during the year for the Sacramento River Cats. In 2018, Stratton was 'up-&-down' twice with Giants and the River Cats. On September 14, 2018, Stratton threw his first MLB complete game against the Colorado Rockies, winning by a score of 2-0. It was his 10th win of the season, making him the Giants‚Äô first pitcher to reach double-digit victories since 2016. It was also the first complete game of the season for the Giants, and the first shutout for the team in over a year. Stratton finished the 2018 season with 10 wins, leading the Giants in wins. =Los Angeles Angels= On March 26, 2019, Stratton was traded to the Los Angeles Angels in exchange for Williams Jerez.

Voyages East Indiamen traveled in convoys as much as they could. Vessels of the British Royal Navy often escorted these convoys, though generally not past India, or before on the return leg. Even so, the Indiamen were heavily armed so that they could dissuade pirates and even large privateers. =Voyage #1 (1789‚Äì90)= For her first voyage, Ocean sailed to Madras and China under the command of Captain James Tod (or Todd). She left Torbay on 26 February 1789, and 10 March she reached Madeira. She then left Madras on 24 June, reaching Whampoa on 26 September. She crossed the Second Bar on 10 January 1790, and reached Saint Helena on 15 April. She arrived back at the Downs on 6 June. =Voyage #2 (1791‚Äì93)= For her second voyage, Ocean was under the command of Captain Andrew Patton, who would remain her captain for the next three voyages. This was his fifth voyage to the east for the company, and his second on Ocean, as he had been her first lieutenant on her previous trip under Tod. On this voyage, Patton sailed her for St Helena, Madras and China. She left the Downs on 17 December 1791 and reached St Helena on 27 February 1792. From there she went on to Madras, which she reached on 10 May. By 23 June, she was at Penang, and one month later, on 25 July, she was at Malacca. She reached Whampoa on 16 August, and on her return trip she crossed the Second Bar on 3 November. She reached St Helena by 12 February 1793, and the Downs by 17 April. The EIC inspected the East Indiamen as they arrived and on 15 October fined Patton and ten other captains ¬£100 each for having not stowed their cargoes in conformance with the Company's orders. The money was to go to Poplar Hospital. =Voyage #3 (1794‚Äì95)= When Ocean was ready to sail, the British government held her at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on √éle de France (Mauritius). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid ¬£586 13s 4d for having delayed her departure by 22 days. Captain Patton left Portsmouth on 2 May, bound for China. Ocean arrived at Whampoa on 27 September. She crossed the Second Bar on 3 December, homeward bound. She arrived at St Helena on 13 April 1795, and the Downs on 23 July. Because this voyage began after the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, Ocean sailed under a letter of marque issued to Captain Andrew Patton on 22 February 1794. The letter authorized her to take prizes should the opportunity arise. =Voyage #4 (1796-loss)= Ocean's fourth voyage was again to Madras and China. Patton left Portsmouth on 17 May 1796, and arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 2 August. From there she sailed to Madras, which she reached in November. She arrived at Colombo on 7 December. From there she sailed to China in company with five other Indiamen: , Captain James Farquharson; , Captain Charles Lennox; , Captain Edward Studd; Canton, Captain Abel Vyvyan; and , Captain George Palmer. Farquahrson was the senior captain of the fleet and hence Commodore. On 28 January 1797 the Indiamen were off the east end of Java heading northward through the Bali Strait Here they encountered Admiral de Sercey and his squadron of frigates, who had left Batavia and wss sailing southward through the Bali Straits on his way back to Mauritius. Farquharson realized that he could not outrun the French force and instead decided on a bluff. He hoisted the flag of Commodore Rainier, the British commander in chief in the East Indies, and made his other ships hoist pendants and ensigns to correspond. Farquharson then detached two of his ships to chase and reconnoitre the enemy. As these advanced towards the French reconnoitering frigate (commanded by Captain Thr√©ouart), the latter crowded sail to join her consorts, with the signal at her mast-head, \\"The enemy is superior in force to the French.\\" Afraid of being unable to repair his frigates and under express orders to avoid giving battle led de Sercey to behave with discretion rather than valour; he withdrew.James (1837) , Vol. 2, pp.79-80. The bluff made Farquharson a celebrity and was greeted with rejoicing by the British press.Some six years later a second fleet of British East Indiamen, including a new Ocean, would pull a similar bluff, though with some exchange of fire, in the battle of Pulo Aura. On 1 February, a storm caused Ocean to strike a reef off Kalatea (). Patton sent the ship's cutter to contact the locals. The crew scuttled Ocean on 5 February; in the evacuation, the ship's boats, except for the longboat, were lost, and two crewmen drowned. The crew then camped on the shore. On 15 February, locals attacked the survivors, killing seven and wounding four. On 18 February, the British left the island in the long boat and three hired proas. Patton and his men reached Amboina on 28 February, after having sailed some 500 miles. On her homeward voyage from China a storm damaged Taunton Castle, forcing her to stop at Ambonya on 16 September 1797. There she took on board survivors from Ocean. Taunton Castle reached Yarmouth on 7 February 1798.'British Library: Taunton Castle. The EIC valued the cargo lost on her at ¬£63,216.

In 2009, (at Scholars‚Äô Colloquium Days on November 7), Gayle Gibson, Rom Teacher & Egyptologist, and Stephanie Holowka, Technician at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, presented evidence to support a theory that Paankhemamun, a mummy on display in the Art Institute of Chicago, is the husband of Djedmaatesankh. Gibson cited that the iconography on the two coffins are very similar and that Pa- ankh-entef would be an acceptable short form of Pa-ankh-en-amun. Holowka noted that scans that she performed showed that there were \\"peculiarities in the mummification process that the mummies also shared.\\" The scan performed by Holowka also revealed that it is unlikely that Djedmaatesankh had any children as her pubic bone was perfectly intact. Dr. Peter Lewin, a pediatrician at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and researcher in the field of paleopathology, led the team that Holowka was a part of, and notes that it is possible that Djedmaatesankh was infertile. He suggests that as a married woman of her age (scans show bone fusion and wear on her teeth indicate her age as 30-35) it was customary for most Egyptian women to have already had several children. \\"A Mummy of a Tale\\", Canada.com, July 25, 2008.

Death  CT-scans performed on the body of Djedmaatesankh (in 1978 and 1994) have shown that she likely died of a dental abscess, which upon erupting, may have led to a fatal blood infection. The results of the scan show a swelling of her left upper jaw, and a 3-D image inside her skull revealed a dental abscess, approximately one inch in diameter, which was caused by a diseased upper left incisor. It is likely that the abscess was there for several weeks prior to erupting and that the infection had spread to her upper left jaw bone, as the scan indicated that the bone was pitted with small holes. Additionally, high-resolution scans show tracks on the jawbone that are believed to be a result of unsuccessful attempts to drain the abscess.

The band plays a fusion of traditional heavy metal with power metal and melodic death metal. History Unleash the Archers was formed in late 2007 by vocalist Brittney Hayes (a.k.a. Brittney Slayes) and drummer Scott Buchanan with former member Brayden Dyczkowski on guitar, whom Scott had played with previously in an independent death metal project. Former member Mike Selman was brought on after his departure from Canadian death metal band Meatlocker Seven. The position of bass player was unfilled for the first few months of Unleash The Archers' career, until Zahk Hedstrom joined in October 2007 to complete the lineup. In late 2008 the band recorded a self-titled four song demo, which featured two songs they would end up re-recording for their first studio album. Their debut studio album was recorded with Jason Hywell Martin at Omega Mediacore Studios in Richmond, BC and was released independently in August 2009. This was the only album to feature the band's original lineup in its entirety. The band's second album was recorded with Nick Engwer and Stu McKillop at the Hive Soundlab in Burnaby, BC and was released independently in May 2011. This album included the first appearance of guitarist Grant Truesdell, who provided solos for their songs Battle in the Shadow (of the Mountain) and The Outlander. He would step in as the new guitar player later that same year after the departure of Mike Selman prior to the recording. The album was a concept album based on the exploits of a mercenary in space and was set far into the future.\\"Unleash The Archers ‚Äì Demons of the AstroWaste\\", Hellbound.ca This album was a three-song EP released solely on 7-inch vinyl. A bonus fourth track titled ‚ÄòArise‚Äô was given to those that pre-ordered, but was later released on the band's bandcamp page in digital format only. This record also marked the departure of original bassist Zahk Hedstrom. In February 2015 the band announced their signing with Napalm Records, and soon after the title, track listing and release date for their upcoming studio album Time Stands Still were revealed. The album was released in Europe on June 26 and in North America on July 10. The album was originally slated for a late-Summer/early-Fall 2014 release, but the release was pushed back after the band was signed by Napalm Records. This album was the first without Brayden Dyczkowski, who had been one of the main songwriters up until his parting with the band in late 2013; this lineup change has affected the band's sound and driven it towards a more traditional heavy metal direction with the addition of Andrew Kingsley, who is also trained in jazz, on guitar. On May 26, 2015, the band released the \\"Tonight We Ride\\" video, inspired by Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The video was filmed in the Nevada desert, using props from the Death Guild Thunderdome camp at Burning Man. Since leaving for a tour of Europe in November 2016, Unleash the Archers mentioned they would be recording a new album at the end of 2016. This album would be the first to include then bassist, Nikko Whitworth. The first single, \\"Cleanse the Bloodlines\\" was released on April 8, 2017. Apex' was released on June 2, 2017 through Napalm Records. The album debuted at No. 3 on iTunes metal charts, and became their first to make Billboard charts. The album debuted at No. 9 Heatseeker, No. 29 Top Hard Music Albums, No. 29 Record Label Independent Current Albums, No. 34 Top Current Rock Albums, No. 116 Overall Digital Albums, No. 119 Top Current Albums, and No. 197 Top Albums by Strata. It also debuted at No. 12 on Canadian Top Hard Music chart. The band announced they would be touring Europe, accompanying Orden Ogan, to promote the album in the fall of 2017, with a US tour to be announced. In end of January it was announced that bassist Nikko Witworth had decided to leave the band.Unleash the Archers: Nikko Whitworth lascia la band. Brittney Hayes gave interviews and tweeted saying that they are currently working on an EP of covers with a \\"bit of a UTA spin\\" on them. They are also writing and recording a full-length album as a follow up to 2017's Apex to be released some time in 2020. On August 30, 2019, the band released the first single off of the EP Explorers, a cover of Stan Rogers' \\"Northwest Passage\\". The full EP was released October 11, 2019.

(later known as World War I.)National World War I Museum at Liberty Memorial, 100 W. 26th Street, Kansas City, Mo. 64108 The volunteer civilian relief organization was founded by philanthropist Anne Morgan (1873‚Äì1952) and her friend Anne Murray Dike (1879‚Äì1929). Morgan's commanding personality and social status helped her rally potential volunteers and raise funds while traveling across the United States. Dike, a physician, organized field work in France. Headquarters were set up in the 17th-century Ch√¢teau de Bl√©rancourt, less than from the war's front. The group's efforts followed the volunteer work of the American Fund for French Wounded (1915-1919). Morgan, youngest daughter of financier John Pierpont Morgan and his second wife, the former Frances Louisa Tracy, used photographs to document the suffering in France, a nation that provided crucial help during the American Revolution. Images of ruined communities and French refugees highlighted the human cost of war. Committee applicants had to speak French, hold a driver's license, and most had to pay their own expenses ‚Äî $1,500 for a typical six-month tour of volunteer duty. Blue martial uniforms were required. They could be custom-made for $45, by B. Altman Company. Anne Morgan told potential volunteers they would face hard work and devastation. \\"We do not want sightseers who would like to go over for half a year to view France's battlefields,\\" The New York Times reported. The women lived in barracks and worked long hours. Some 350 volunteers from the American Committee for Devastated France served in France. Among them was Mary Carson Breckinridge (1881-1965). Many female physicians in the United States ‚Äî an estimated 6,000 during The Great War era ‚Äî wanted to serve in Europe. The military medical corps would not accept women as officers, so the committee provided an opportunity to serve. Breckinridge gained key experience in post- war Europe that helped inspire her to create the non-profit Kentucky Committee for Mothers and Babies, later known as the Frontier Nursing Service.http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=36/ The Morgan Library and Museum archives Anna Lander West McDonnell (1876-1966), youngest child of Charles and Marguerite Rode Lander West of San Francisco, California, was already living in France at the time of the war, having moved to Paris with her husband in 1907. Widowed in 1910, owning land in France and with no children, McDonnell served as a hospital auxiliary or nurse in Bordeaux until around the start of the Great War. She returned to the United States, but went back to France in 1918 to serve the committee.http://knowledgecenter.unr.edu/specoll/mss/96-13.html/ University of Nevada-Reno archives Another volunteer was future diplomat Lucile Atcherson Curtis, who was eventually transferred to Paris to become director of personnel there for the American Committee for Devastated France, and in December 1919 was given the Medaille de la Reconnaissance Francaise for her work. Established landscape architect Mary Rutherfurd Jay would also join the ranks of Morgan's Committee, commanding an agricultural unit of women who trained wounded soldiers to raise crops by seed. Jessie Carson was an American librarian who was appointed the director of children's libraries for the American Committee for Devastated France in 1918. She is credited with making lasting change in French libraries, particularly by extending services to children, who had not traditionally been served by French libraries.

Hamilton (1853) On the geometrical interpretation of some results obtained by calculation with biquaternions, Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 5: 388‚Äì90, link from David R. Wilkins collection at Trinity College, Dublin The Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is expressed by bivectors. In particular, if r1 and r2 are right versors so that r_1^2 = -1 = r_2^2, then the biquaternion curve traces over and over the unit circle in the plane Such a circle corresponds to the space rotation parameters of the Lorentz group. Now , and the biquaternion curve is a unit hyperbola in the plane The spacetime transformations in the Lorentz group that lead to FitzGerald contractions and time dilation depend on a hyperbolic angle parameter. In the words of Ronald Shaw, \\"Bivectors are logarithms of Lorentz transformations.\\"Ronald Shaw and Graham Bowtell (1969) \\"The Bivector Logarithm of a Lorentz Transformation\\", Quarterly Journal of Mathematics 20:497-503 The commutator product of this Lie algebra is just twice the cross product on R3, for instance, , which is twice . As Shaw wrote in 1970: :Now it is well known that the Lie algebra of the homogeneous Lorentz group can be considered to be that of bivectors under commutation. [...] The Lie algebra of bivectors is essentially that of complex 3-vectors, with the Lie product being defined to be the familiar cross product in (complex) 3-dimensional space.Ronald Shaw (1970) \\"The subgroup structure of the homogeneous Lorentz group\\", Quarterly Journal of Mathematics 21:101-24 William Rowan Hamilton coined both the terms vector and bivector. The first term was named with quaternions, and the second about a decade later, as in Lectures on Quaternions (1853). The popular text Vector Analysis (1901) used the term.Edwin Bidwell Wilson (1901) Vector Analysis Given a bivector , the ellipse for which r1 and r2 are a pair of conjugate semi-diameters is called the directional ellipse of the bivector r. In the standard linear representation of biquaternions as 2 √ó 2 complex matrices acting on the complex plane with basis :\\\\begin{pmatrix}hv & w+hx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-w+hx & -hv\\\\end{pmatrix} represents bivector . The conjugate transpose of this matrix corresponds to ‚àíq, so the representation of bivector q is a skew-Hermitian matrix. Ludwik Silberstein studied a complexified electromagnetic field , where there are three components, each a complex number, known as the Riemann-Silberstein vector. \\"Bivectors [...] help describe elliptically polarized homogeneous and inhomogeneous plane waves ‚Äì one vector for direction of propagation, one for amplitude.\\"Telegraphic review of Bivectors and Waves in Mechanics and Optics, American Mathematical Monthly 1995 page 571 References * P.H.

These include sending a bouquet of roses with a CD and concert invite to supermodel Amber valletta during an appearance at Neiman Marcus, Darlington appearing onstage in drag, and regular appearances on KTCK radio station on a former night time talk radio show called the Wild Ass Circus. =Sex offense= After a three-year legal battle over a charge of sexual assault stemming from a 2006 encounter with a 16-year- old girl, Darlington accepted a plea bargain in 2009 for five years deferred adjudication probation as well as mandatory counseling. He was also required to register as a sex offender. Texas state law prohibited Darlington from presenting mitigating evidence that the female had misrepresented her age to him in court as a defense. Darlington appealed the case on that basis, but the appeal was denied. Darlington completed probation and counseling in November 2014. In 2016 the state of Texas approved application for Darlington to be removed from the sex offender registry, but the judge would not sign off on the removal unless the Dallas district attorney's office also signed off on the removal. The DA office refused.

Synopsis Bob Carson (Bob Baker) and his sidekick Grizzly (George Cleveland) hear that a stagecoach owned by Mary (Marjorie Reynolds) is being mysteriously robbed of gold shipments. The gold is placed in the strongbox, but has vanished when the stagecoach arrives at its destination. Carson takes on the job of driving the stage. It turns out that a local bad guy has a small accomplice who hides in a case that is shipped on the stage, and slips out to steal the gold from the strongbox during the journey, then retreats to the case. At the other end, the case is taken away but the strongbox is empty. Carson works out the trick, hides in the case, is discovered, escapes, and the villain is captured. With the problem solved, Carson marries Mary. Production The Phantom Stage was the last of Universal's singing cowboy movies featuring Bob Baker.

The Rockies selected Dahl in the first round of the 2012 MLB draft out of Oak Mountain High School in Birmingham, Alabama. Dahl made his major league debut on July 25, 2016. Amateur career Dahl attended Oak Mountain High School in Birmingham, Alabama. As a freshman, he made the school's varsity baseball team as a shortstop. In 2011, Dahl was selected to play for the United States 18-and-under national baseball team, and appeared in the 2011 Pan American Games. Dahl recorded 11 runs batted in (RBIs) during the 15 games of the tournament, in which the United States won the gold medal. In 2012, his senior at Oak Mountain, Dahl had a .412 batting average, 34 RBIs, and 18 stolen bases as an outfielder. He committed to attend Auburn University on a scholarship to play college baseball for the Auburn Tigers. Professional career The Colorado Rockies selected Dahl in the first round, with the tenth overall selection, of the 2012 MLB draft. Dahl signed with the Rockies, receiving a $2.6 million signing bonus, rather than follow through on his commitment to attend Auburn University. He made his professional debut for the Grand Junction Rockies of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, hitting .379/.423/.625 with nine home runs and 57 RBIs. He was named the Pioneer League's most valuable player. 2016 Colorado Rockies spring training Prior to the 2013 season, Dahl was ranked as the Rockies second best prospect by Baseball America. He was also ranked as the 58th best prospect in baseball by MLB.com. The Rockies suspended Dahl at the beginning of the season, reportedly because he missed a team flight, and played in ten games for the Asheville Tourists of the Class A South Atlantic League, missing the remainder of the season due to a torn hamstring. Dahl began the 2014 season with Asheville, and was promoted to the Modesto Nuts of the Class A-Advanced California League in July. Between Asheville and Modesto, Dahl batted .299, hit 14 home runs, and stole 21 bases for the season. On May 28, 2015, while playing for the New Britain Rock Cats of the Class AA Eastern League, Dahl collided with a teammate during a game while chasing a fly ball, and suffered a spleen laceration. After surgery to repair the damage, Dahl opted to have his spleen removed, rather than waiting for it to heal, in order to return to baseball with less recovery time. Allowing it to heal would have cost Dahl the remainder of the season, while removing it left him with a recovery time of four to six weeks. He resumed playing baseball in July, with a six-game rehabilitation stint with the Boise Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, before returning to New Britain. Dahl finished the season with a .278 batting average, six home runs, and 22 stolen bases. The Rockies invited Dahl to spring training as a non- roster player in 2016. Dahl began the 2016 season with the Hartford Yard Goats of the Eastern League. After he batted .278 with 13 home runs, 45 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases for Hartford, the Rockies promoted Dahl to the Albuquerque Isotopes of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Dahl appeared in the All-Star Futures Game as an injury replacement for Austin Meadows. After batting .484 in 16 games for Albuquerque, the Rockies promoted Dahl to MLB on July 25, 2016, and he made his MLB debut that night as the Rockies' starting left fielder. Dahl recorded his first MLB hit off the Baltimore Orioles' Yovani Gallardo during his debut. On August 11, 2016, Dahl pushed a career-opening hitting streak to 17 games, tying the MLB record set by Chuck Aleno in 1941. The hitting streak ended at 17 games. During spring training in 2017, Dahl had a stress fracture in a rib, making it painful to swing the bat. After developing back spasms while rehabilitating in July, the Rockies shut Dahl down for the season. In 2019, Dahl played 100 games, hitting .302 with 15 home runs and 61 RBI. He was named to the National League All-Star roster and recorded a single in the All-Star Game. Personal life Dahl lives with his dog, a Golden Retriever named Rookie, and his wife, Jacquelyn Dahl, founder of 1UP Sports Marketing, where she represents high-profile athletes such as Patrick Mahomes, Julian Edelman, and Danny Amendola.

Egypt has an embassy in Damascus. Syria has an embassy in Cairo. Both countries were members of the Arab League, but as of November 2011, Syria has been suspended from the League due to its failure to follow up with an agreement concerning its current civil war.World Report:2012, Human Rights Watch Relations were generally well under the reign of Hosni Mubarak, but since has been strained after the election of hardline Mohamed Morsi. Egypt closed down its embassy in Damascus in 2011. However, relations were restored in July 2013, and the embassies in both countries were reopened at that time.  History of relations = United Arab Republic = Pan-Arab sentiment was traditionally very strong in Syria, and Nasser was a popular hero-figure throughout the Arab world following the Suez War of 1956. There was thus considerable popular support in Syria for union with Nasser's Egypt. The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was the leading advocate of such a union. On 1 February 1958, a group of political and military leaders in Syria proposed a merger of the two states to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Thus, on 22 February 1958, the United Arab Republic was formed. However, the newly-created republic was short-lived and collapsed a mere three years later, on 1961 following the 1961 Syrian coup d'√©tat.Middle East Record Volume 2, 1961 Nonetheless, relations between Egypt and Syria were cordial after the collapse of the union, and Syria stood by Egypt during the Six-Day War of 1967, which resulted in Egypt losing the Sinai and Syria losing the Golan. = Yom Kippur War = In 1973, Egypt and Syria launched the Yom Kippur War on Israel with a coordinated attack to retake Sinai and the Golan. Although the 2-weeks long war ended with Egypt regaining Sinai and Syria restoring a strip of land from the Israeli-occupied Golan, Egyptian-Syrian relations have become strained due to Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat's peace treaty with Israel in the Camp David Accords. Hafez al-Assad severed all relations with Egypt after the signing of the peace deal, and diplomatic relations were not re-established until 2005, when Egypt once again enjoyed warm relations with Syria under the rule of Bashar al-Assad. = Post- Revolution Egypt = 2011‚Äì2013 After the Arab Spring and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, relations became extremely strained. The Muslim Brotherhood is a banned organisation and its membership is a capital offence in Syria. Egypt severed all relations with the Syrian Arab Republic in 2013 but resumed months later. Under Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, Egypt supported the Syrian opposition and called on Assad to step down, largely due to the rule of Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Egypt. On 15 June 2013, President Morsi ordered the closing of the Syrian Embassy in Cairo and called for a no-fly zone over Syria. An estimated of between 70,000 and 100,000 Syrian refugees were living in the country under Morsi's rule and the government tried to support Syrian refugees by offering residency permits, assistance on finding employment, allowing Syrian refugee children to register in state schools and access to other public services. 2013‚Äìpresent Diplomatic relations were restored, and the embassies reopened after Morsi was removed from office just weeks later in July 2013. In July 2013, the two countries agreed to reopen the Egyptian consulate in Damascus and the Syrian consulate in Cairo. In late November 2016, some Arab media outlets reported that Egyptian pilots arrived in mid-November to Syria to help the Syrian government in its fight against the Islamic State and Al Nusra front. This came after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi publicly stated that he supported the Syrian military in the civil war in Syria. However, several days later, Egypt officially denied it has a military presence in Syria.Egypt denies its military is in Syria Although Egypt has not been vocal in support for any sides of Syria's ongoing civil war, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said in 2016 that his nation's priority is \\"supporting national armies\\", which he said included the Syrian Armed Forces. He also said regarding Egypt's stance in the conflict: \\"Our stance in Egypt is to respect the will of the Syrian people, and that a political solution to the Syrian crisis is the most suitable way, and to seriously deal with terrorist groups and disarm them,\\". Egypt's support for a political solution was reaffirmed in February 2017. Egypt's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said that Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, \\"during his meeting with UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, on Saturday confirmed Egypt‚Äôs rejection of any military intervention that would violate Syrian sovereignty and undermine opportunities of the standing political solutions.‚Äù Egypt has also expressed great interest in rebuilding postwar Syria, with many Egyptian companies and businessmen discussing investment opportunities in Syria as well as participation in the reconstruction effort. Tarik al-Nabrawi, president of Egypt's Engineers Syndicate said that 2018 will witness a ‚Äúboom and influential role for Egyptian construction companies in Syria and to open the door for other companies ‚Äî in the electricity, building material, steel, aluminum, ceramics and sanitary material fields among others ‚Äî to work in the Syrian market and participate in rebuilding cities and facilities that the war has destroyed.‚Äù On 25 February 2018, Syrian state news reported that an Egyptian delegation composed of \\"members of the Islamic and Arab Assembly for supporting Resistance and Future Pioneers movement as well as a number of figures\\", including Jamal Zahran and Farouk Hassan, visited the Syrian consulate in Cairo to express solidarity with the Syrian government. Despite Egypt's close support to the Syrian regime of Assad, Egypt has also been tangled in keeping a good relationship with Saudi Arabia, a major anti-Assad country. As a response, Egypt has distanced itself from Saudi policies, thus this caused a temporary tension between Saudi Arabia and Egypt in 2016 in regard to Syria.https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/a-familiar- pattern-in-egypts-spat-with-saudi-arabiahttps://www.memri.org/reports/egypt- saudi-dispute-over-resolution-syria-crisis-goes-public  See also  * Foreign relations of Egypt * Foreign relations of Syria * United Arab Republic  References   External links  * http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/63677/World/Region/More- than-,-Syrian-refugees-in-Egypt.aspx Syria Category:Bilateral relations of Syria ","title":"Egypt‚ÄìSyria relations"},{"id":"38380063","title":"Comedown Machine"},{"id":"38380105","text":"The Breaka Burleigh Pro is a surfing competition which has been held annually since 2010 in February at Burleigh Heads, Queensland, Australia.\\"2013 Breaka Burleigh Pro to Break New Ground By Adding Womens ASP 6 Star Division.\\" It is sponsored by Breaka Flavoured Milk.\\"Breaka Burleigh Pro WQS - 2010.\\" Surfing Queensland.

Under Emirati law, multiple crimes carry the death penalty, and executions are carried through either a firing squad, hanging, or stoning. Current laws allows the death penalty for treason, espionage, murder, successfully inciting the suicide of a person \\"afflicted with total lack of free will or reason\\", arson resulting in death, acts of indecent assault resulting in death, apostasy, rape, aggravated robbery, terrorism, sodomy, homosexuality, drug trafficking and joining the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Overseas nationals and UAE nationals have both been executed for crimes. Notable cases In 1995, Sarah Balabagan, a Filipino worker, caught the attention of many people living in the UAE. She was reported to have murdered her employer in his Al Ain house, although she has always maintained that she only killed him in self-defence after he tried to rape her. After the UAE president himself got involved, Balabagan was set free and had to pay compensation instead. However, she was deported back to her country and her right to remain in the country was cancelled. On 10 February 2011, Rashid Al Rashidi was executed by firing squad, the convicted was charged of raping and murdering a four-year-old child Moosa Mukhtiar in the toilets of a mosque on 27 November 2009. In June 2015, the Federal Supreme Court sentenced an Emirati terrorist woman, Alaa Bader al-Hashemi, to the death penalty for the murder of Ibolya Ryan and planting a \\"handmade bomb\\" in an Egyptian-American doctor's home in Abu Dhabi. The woman committed the crime in December 2014 and was executed at dawn on July 13, 2015. This is the only time that a prisoner has been executed within such a short time frame and this is the one of the few cases of a woman being executed.

The database focuses on species (as opposed to higher ranks such as families) and has entries for all currently recognized ~13,000 species and their subspecies, although there is usually a lag time of up to a few months before newly described species become available online. The database collects scientific and common names, synonyms, literature references, distribution information, type information, etymology, and other taxonomically relevant information. History The database was founded in 1995 as EMBL Reptile Database when the founder, Peter Uetz, was a graduate student at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany. Thure Etzold had developed the first web interface for the EMBL DNA sequence database which was also used as interface for the Reptile Database. In 2006 the database moved to The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) and briefly operated as TIGR Reptile Database until TIGR was merged into the J Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) where Uetz was an associate professor until 2010. Since 2010 the database has been maintained on servers in the Czech Republic under the supervision of Peter Uetz and Jir√≠ Ho≈°ek, a Czech programmer. Content Number of reptile genera with a given number of species. Most genera have only one or a few species but a few may have hundreds. Based on data from the Reptile Database (as of May 2015). As of September 2020, the Reptile Database lists about 11,300 species (including another ~2,200 subspecies) in about 1200 genera (see figure), and has more than 50,000 literature references and about 15,000 photos. The database has constantly grown since its inception with an average of 100 to 200 new species described per year over the preceding decade. Recently, the database also added a more or less complete list of primary type specimens. Relationship to other databases The Reptile Database has been a member of the Species 2000 project that has produced the Catalogue of Life (CoL), a meta-database of more than 150 species databases that catalog all living species on the planet.Catalogue of Life Source databases, accessed Aug 2015 The CoL provides taxonomic information to the Encyclopedia of Life (EoL).

It is preceded by several observances such as Lent and Carnival, as well as an observance of a day dedicated to the Virgin of the Sorrows, as well as a Mass marking the abandonment of Jesus by the disciples. Holy Week proper begins on Palm Sunday, with the palms used on this day often woven into intricate designs. In many places processions, Masses and other observances can happen all week, but are most common on , Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday, with just about every community marking the crucifixion of Jesus in some way on Good Friday. Holy Saturday is marked by the Burning of Judas, especially in the center and south of the country, with Easter Sunday usually marked by a Mass as well as the ringing of church bells. Mexico's Holy Week traditions are mostly based on those from Spain, brought over with the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, but observances have developed variations in different parts of the country due to the evangelization process in the colonial period and indigenous influences. Several locations have notable observances related to Holy Week including Iztapalapa in Mexico City, Taxco, San Miguel de Allende and San Luis Potos√≠. Religious and cultural observance Procession with crosses at the La Cuevita church in Iztapalapa Palm Sunday observance at a school Holy Week is one of the most widely celebrated and important religious observances in Mexico. Almost all towns and cities in the country have some kind of public observance during a two-week period that starts from Palm Sunday at least to Easter Sunday and can extend into the week after. Mexican television features movies, documentaries and other shows focused on the religious event and other topics related to the Catholic faith, especially in Latin America. The U.S. traditions surrounding Easter have made very little inroads in Mexico, with icons such as the Easter Bunny and events such as Easter egg hunts limited to supermarkets and areas right along the border with the United States. Like most Mexican Catholic traditions, those related to Holy Week and Easter are based on the Spanish Catholic calendar. Holy Week is preceded by Lent and Ash Wednesday, which itself is preceded by Carnival . However, a number of traditions and customs have developed over the centuries. As most events related to Holy Week occur outside and in large gatherings, antojitos (roughly translated as Mexican street food or snacks) is most associated with the holiday. Prior to Easter Sunday, Lenten dietary rules are still in effect for the observant, so popular street foods include pambazos with cheese, fried fish, fried plantains, hot cakes/pancakes with various toppings. Candies are a popular street food at this time, especially traditional and regional ones made from coconut, tamarind and various fruits. Holy Week was also the traditional start of the ice cream and flavored ice season, which was originally made in Mexico City with ice and snow brought down from the Popocatepetl volcano. Ice cream fairs are still held at this time. Today's frozen treats include ice cream in tubs, as well as popsicles made from both fruit and cream, as well as snow cones called ‚Äúraspados.‚Äù Another popular refreshment is called ‚Äúaguas frescas‚Äù or sugared drinks made from fruit or other natural flavorings such as tamarind or hibiscus flowers. The reason for the popularity of both frozen desserts and flavored drinks is that spring to early summer is generally the warmest part of the year in many parts of Mexico. Just before Holy Week proper, there are two events celebrated in various parts of the country. The first is the feast of the Virgin of Sorrows (Virgen de los Dolores). This occurs the Friday before Good Friday and focuses on the pain and sacrifice of Mary knowing that Jesus had to die to save mankind. This image of the Virgin is usually dressed in purple and altars are set up to her on this day. On the Wednesday before Easter, a Mass called the ‚Äúvespers of darkness‚Äù (los matines de la tinieblas) recalls the disciples‚Äô abandonment of Jesus. The altar of the church will have a candelabra with fifteen candles, with one candle extinguished after the singing of a Psalm until only the center candle, representing Jesus, remains lit. Holy Week begins on Palm Sunday, and many communities have special Masses dedicated to the blessing of palm fronds. These fronds are often woven into crosses and other designs, sometimes quite intricate and brought by parishioners to have holy water sprinkled on them. Some fronds are later burned and the ashes saved for marking foreheads on the following Ash Wednesday. Maundy Thursday is the beginning of the celebration of Easter proper. Cathedrals in the country have special Masses celebrated by bishops when ‚Äúchrism‚Äù, a sacred oil used in the sacraments, is consecrated. Many churches also hold reenactments of the Last Supper, but Masses usually omit the exchanges of greeting of peace as a reminder of Judas‚Äô betrayal of Jesus. From this day through Holy Saturday, church bells are traditionally not rung. Reenactments of the day of crucifixion take place in almost all communities in Mexico on Good Friday and for a number these traditions extend to a passion play enacted most or all of Holy Week. The focus of these reenactments is on the carrying of the cross by Jesus and his crucifixion, as told by the Stations of the Cross. In major productions, hundreds of people participate including the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, the Betrayal, the Judgment, the procession with the cross, the Crucifixion up to the Resurrection. Holy Saturday is dedicated to vigil as the waiting time between Jesus‚Äô death and resurrection. Statues of the Virgin Mary are dressed in black as a symbol of mourning. Frequently there is a solemn evening Mass during which participants hold lighted candles. This is then followed by an event called the Burning of Judas mostly practiced in central and southern Mexico. Originally, it was the burning in effigy of the disciple that betrayed Jesus, a custom introduced to Mexico as part of the evangelization process. During the Mexican Inquisition, effigies were also burnt to mock and protest the burning of people at the stake. These effigies were banned but the idea of protest was transferred to the Judas figures. The Burning of Judas continues in other places but it has been banned in Mexico City because of safety and pollution concerns. The figures are still made in the city but many are now collector's items. Easter Sunday is celebrated with Mass which is usually crowded. Church bells will again ring and the plazas around the churches after Mass will be crowded with churchgoers as well as street vendors selling food, toys, balloons and more. Regional variations in observance Amuzgo Good Friday procession in Xochistlahuaca. Participant dressed as a Roman soldier for the Iztapalapa passion play In many areas, processions, Masses and other activities extend for another week. Mexico's Holy Week traditions are based on Spanish ones brought over during the Conquest, along with those created during the evangelization process with some indigenous influence. This has resulted in variations in the celebrations in various regions and towns. A number of these variations have become well known, such as those in Taxco, San Luis Potos√≠, San Miguel de Allende, Ajijic, and Iztapalapa in Mexico City. Other communities with notable celebrations include P√°tzcuaro, Tzintzuntzan, Quer√©taro, Huajicori, Mesa de Nayar, Creel, Cusarare (Chihuahua), San Ignacio Arareco (Chihuahua), Jerez, Atlixco, Temascalcingo, San Juan Chamula and Zinacant√°n. The most famous passion play in Mexico is held in Iztapalapa in the east of Mexico City. This production involves over 4000 local residents (all of whom are born in Iztapalapa) whom perform scenes related to the last week of Jesus's life from Palm Sunday to Good Friday. The production has been done each year since 1843 and today the spectacle attracts over 2 million spectators, mostly Mexican. The play is not a strictly Biblical production as there are a number of characters such as a spy, a dog, a ‚Äúwandering Jew‚Äù and others that are unique to this event. When Christ is captured, Aztec drums and flutes are played. Pontius Pilate sentences Jesus on the town of Iztapalapa's main square then whipped. He then carries a cross from this square to the Cerro de la Estrella on a route over a mile long through eight of the borough's oldest neighborhoods. The most important event is the procession with the cross and the crucifixion scene portrayed on Cerro de la Estrella. Many others called ‚ÄúNazarenes‚Äù follow, carrying their own crosses and wearing real crowns of thorns like Jesus. The play ends with Judas hanging himself after the crucifixion. Statue of a Flagelante penitent in Taxco Another important and unique commemoration of Holy Week occurs in Taxco in the state of Guerrero. It begins on Palm Sunday, with a large wooden statue of Christ traveling on a donkey from the town of Tehuilotepec about four miles to the center of Taxco. The image is preceded in its entrance to Taxco by children on bicycles and residents portraying the Twelve Apostles as well as a drummer. Processions continue all week, led by very young children dressed as angels, immediately followed by older girls dressed in white with white veils, walking barefoot and swinging incense burners containing copal. In these processions, Biblical figures related to the Passion of Christ are represented by wooden statues from the town and surrounding villages, carried on litters, accompanied by musical instruments playing melodies with pre-Hispanic influence. The most notable aspect of these processions are the penitents who inflict pain and suffering on themselves during the processions. While these displays have moderated or disappeared in other parts of Mexico, they remain severe in Taxco. Penitents form into three brotherhoods called the Animas or Bent Ones, the Encruzados (the Crossed) and the Flagelantes (Flagellants). All wear black robes, a horsehair belt and a hood to hide their identity. The Animas walk in procession bent at the waist, never straightening, carrying relics, crosses or candles. This is the only brotherhood that admits women, who are distinguished by lighter chains attached to their ankles. The Encruzados carry a bundle of thorned blackberry canes of up to 100 pounds tied onto their shirtless back and arms with a candle in each hand. The Flagelantes are also bare-backed and carry a large wooden cross in their arms; in their hands are a rosary and a whip with metal points. At appointed places, the penitent hands off the cross, kneels and whips his back. On Maundy Thursday, a scene recreating the Garden of Gethsemane is set up at the Santa Prisca church and on Friday, the statue of Jesus praying is ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù and ‚Äújailed.‚Äù On Friday it is ‚Äúcrucified‚Äù inside the church with the penitent brotherhoods looking on. A candlelight vigil is on Holy Saturday, ending late in the night with the announcement that Christ has risen. Easter Sunday is quiet. San Miguel de Allende is noted for its observances of Holy Week, and for two weeks there is at least one procession per day. The focus for much of the pageantry is the ‚ÄúEl Se√±or de la Columna‚Äù Christ image, which is brought from the sanctuary of Atotonilco and paraded among the various churches of the area from the Sunday before Palm Sunday to the Wednesday after Easter when it returns to Atotonilco. On Good Friday, this image is carried to the parish church of San Miguel, accompanied by residents dressed as the disciples and Roman soldiers. At noon, images of the Holy Family, the disciples, Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist are also in procession and a passion play is performed. At dark, the images reappear in procession but dressed in black and accompanied by measured drumbeats. During this time, Concheros dancers sporadically appear, especially in the main square of San Miguel. The Burning of Judas occurs on Easter Sunday, not Holy Saturday. A number of cities and towns hold Processions of Silence, where people march on the street holding candles in silence. The custom comes from the Spanish city of Seville. The most important of these processions is held in the city of San Luis Potos√≠ on Good Friday. It begins at 8 pm at the Plaza del Carmen, with actors dressed as Roman troops playing drums and bugle. This guard then knocks on the door of the Carmen Church. The beginning of the procession leaves the church, carrying crosses and paschal candles. They are joined by more as they move onto the streets, dressed in white robes with cone-shaped hoods with symbols denoting what religious group they belong to. In addition to the robed participants, there are also those dressed as charros, and Adelitas (women of the Mexican Revolution) as well as some in indigenous dress. The focal point of the procession is a large figure of the Virgin of Solitude, the Virgin Mary left alone after the death of Jesus. It and its platform weigh more than a ton and are carried on the shoulders of forty men. The procession continues around the town, punctuated by ritual speeches until midnight, when the last of the robed figures returns to the Carmen Church. In Tzintzuntzan for most of Holy Week, there are men on horseback, in red hoods and lavender robes, that patrol the area to make sure that stores or craftsmen are doing business as usual. A central activity is processions with penitents led by seven large crosses which have been in the care of seven family for generations. These crosses are then at the front of the parish church on Good Friday as a passion play is performed. Local legend says that as recently as the 1970s, in a nearby village, penitents still had themselves nailed to crosses. A major pilgrimage site for Holy Week is Chalma, the second most visited pilgrimage site in Mexico after the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The focus of the pilgrimage is an image of a black, crucified Christ and the rites here are a mix of Christian and pre-Hispanic influences, such as bathers dipping into a fresh water spring for purification. Dance is a central part of the rites, and an Aztec tradition states that newcomers are obliged to dance for at least one tune. Other important events for Holy Week include a procession behind a black-faced Christ figure in Patzcuaro, the veneration of a purple-robed paper mache image of Christ at the San Francisco Church in the historic center of Mexico City and that of the Tarahumara in Chihuahua, who paint themselves white for ritual. The vacation period Procession of the Via Crucis that takes place on Good Friday in the community of Las Mesas, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tlaxcala In addition to its importance religiously, it has also become a very important vacation period. Many companies shut down in order to provide time off especially between Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday, with some having the following week off as well. Schoolchildren up through high school generally get two weeks off but university students get only one week. The only class of workers working in full that week are those in the tourism industry. While the original reason for the time off was for religious observance, many skip this aspect at least for part of the time to go on vacation. Hotels, restaurants and more are crowded, especially at major resorts and other tourist destinations. Airline and other transport prices tend to be higher with terminals crowded at the very beginning and end of the vacation period. Highways will also be heavily used. In 2010 over nine million Mexicans traveled somewhere for the holiday with an economic impact of over ten billion pesos. In 2011 the Mexico City eastern bus terminal, TAPO, served 180,000 people per day during Holy Week, about double its normal volume. However, major metropolitan areas such as Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara tend to be quieter than normal during this week, as many workers in these cities leave for vacation and/or to visit family in the provinces. The most important vacation spots at this time are beach areas such as Acapulco, Canc√∫n, Puerto Vallarta, Veracruz, Mazatlan, Los Cabos and Huatulco. These vacations are generally taken together as families. Beach towns and other resorts fill with vacationers as well as street vendors and wandering musicians who take advantage of the business opportunity. Occupancy rates climb to over 85% and 100% occupancy is not uncommon, leading to rooms rented in private homes. Those who cannot find accommodations often sleep in their vehicles or even on the beach. Other vacation destinations include colonial cities in the center such as Morelia, Guanajuato, Quer√©taro, San Miguel de Allende, Taxco, San Luis Potos√≠ and Zacatecas, which receive significant numbers of visitors as well. Many also cross the border into the United States during this week, especially those who live in the north and/or who have family there to visit. It is also popular to go shopping in the country at this time, making it an important time for some US retailers, especially those near the Mexican border.

The election coincided with the elections of other offices, including the presidential election, the senatorial election, the gubernatorial election, and various state and local elections. The winning candidate would serve a two-year term in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1857, to March 4, 1859. Background Florida's single seat in the House of Representatives had been held by the Democrats since 1852. In the 1854 election, the Democratic Party made key gains in the former Whig strongholds of Pensacola and Jacksonville. By 1856, the Whig Party had collapsed, and they were replaced in the South by the Know Nothing Party, also known as the American Party, which was serving as a successor to the prior Anti-Masonic Party.

The Herrn [Lords] von Merveldt were among the oldest families in the M√ºnsterland. Merfeld, the eponymous seat of the family, is now a neighborhood of the city of D√ºlmen in the District of Coesfeld in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. History =Origin= The first documented member of the family was in 1169, when the Ministerialis Henricus de Merevelde appeared in documents.(de) Westf√§lisches Urkundenbuch, Band II [Book of Westphalian Records, Volume II], No. 342 The reliable line of descent began with 1227, the date mentioned in documents with ‚Äúministerialis beati Pauli‚Äù [Latin, ‚ÄúMinistrialis of St. Paul‚Äôs‚Äù], the office of Hermannus de Mervelde, Ministerial of the Prince-Bishops of Munster.(de) Westf√§lisches Urkundenbuch, Band III [Book of Westphalian Records, Volume III], No. 245 Bernd and Hermann von Merveldt mentioned in documents from 1251, were Burgmannen [castle defenders] of D√ºlmen for the Prince-Bishops of M√ºnster. =Development= , built in the second half of the 17th Century, one of the earliest Baroque castles in Westphalia The grandson of the progenitor Hermann founded three lines. The first of them was derived from Johannes, the Ritter [knight] and Schenk [butler] of the Bishop of M√ºnster and who later called himself only Schenk, and was established until 1400 in D√ºlmen. Hermann, the Burgmann of Stromberg, the second line, which became extinct in 1691 (based on the eponymous family seat, Merfeld). The third and still flourishing line began with Heinrich, the knight and, like his brother, Burgmann of Stromberg (later a resident at Schloss Westerwinkel). A branch of this line was later also established in Courland (now western Latvia). Numerous members of the family remained in the service of the Prince-Bishops of M√ºnster and were canons in the M√ºnster Cathedral. Later, they also appeared in the cathedral chapters of Hildesheim, Osnabr√ºck and Paderborn. In St. Mauritz (now in the east side of M√ºnster) and Xanten they were canons. Female members of the family performed as canonesses in Kanonissenstift (secular nunnery) √úberwasser in M√ºnster, Borghorst and the St. Boniface Frauenstift (secular nunnery) in Freckenhorst. Bishop Heidenreich of M√ºnster granted Marshal Heinrich von Merveldt in 1389 the manor of Wolbeck (now in the southeastern part of M√ºnster). There, the Herrn von Merveldt held the office of Drosten (bailiffs) until the Secularization. The goal of an independent Imperial estate was not achieved because of the disputes within the family and of the encroachments of the episcopal lords. With his efforts as the moderator, Hermann von Merveldt Hermann participated in the completion of the Treaty of Kranenburg (23 October 1457) to end the M√ºnster Bishops Feud (1450-1457). During the Anabaptist Rebellion (1534‚Äì1535) in M√ºnster, the Herrn von Merveldt went to the side of the Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster. Dietrich von Merveldt (died 1564), Drost of Wolbeck, undertook in 1532 an unsuccessful attempt to restore the order of a levy on the farmers in the city. While the Westerwinkel Line therefore always stayed in contact with the sovereign of the Prince-Bishopric, the Merfeld Line looked in late 16th and early 17th Centuries to defend its domains against all sovereign influences. Claiming its own jurisdiction, including the place of execution and the development of a Reformed church system in Merfeld was for Adolf III von Merveldt (1546‚Äì1604) and Johann Adolf von Merveldt (1580‚Äì1619) the appropriate tools for the defense of their local domination. The religious opposition against the Prince-Bishop - typical of many families of the Westphalian nobility at this time - after the Thirty Years' War and the inheritance of the House of Merfeld by the Herrn von Merode (1693) cost the family its importance, but the jurisdiction claimed by the House of Merfeld was kept for it until the end of the Prince-Bishopric (1803). , Baroque castle still owned by the family From the Westerwinkel Line was Dietrich Hermann von Merveldt (1598‚Äì1658) the Lord Chamberlain of the Electorate of Cologne and minister at the Imperial Diets of Regensburg. Beginning with his son Dietrich Hermann II von Merveldt (1624‚Äì1688), all the hereditary heads of the family were (Obrist-)Hofmarsch√§lle [(Colonel-) Court Marshals], members of the (Secret) Councils and Drosten of Wolbeck, all for the Prince-Bishops of M√ºnster. Maximilian Friedrich von Merveldt (1764‚Äì1815), Austrian Feldmarschall-Leutnant [Lieutenant Field Marshal] and regimental commander, participated in the 1813 Battle of Leipzig and later became an ambassador in London. =Possessions= During the 19th Century the family owned the manors of Lembeck, Ostendorf and Hagenbeck in the District of Recklinghausen, Steinhaus in Werne, the Burg Geinegge (a castle in Bockum- Hovel) and the Schloss Westerwinkel (in Ascheberg-Herbern) in the District of Ludinghausen (after 1975, District of Coesfeld), Wolbeck bei Muenster, Huxdiek and Seppenhagen in the District of Beckum (after 1975, District of Warendorf), Feckenhorst in the District of Warendorf, Empte in the District of Coesfeld and - because of the marriage into the family of the Barons Droste zu H√ºlshoff (most famous family member was Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff) - the manor of F√ºchtel in Vechta (Lower Saxony). From 1717 to 1923 the family also had a Familienfideikommiss(de) ‚ÄúFamilienfideikomiss‚Äù, German Wikipedia, :de:Familienfideikommiss [a legal way to keep its lands and finances together in its single head for generations]. =Achievements= Dietrich Hermann von Merveldt (1624‚Äì1688), Privy Chamberlain of the Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster and the Drost of Wolbeck, was raised on 17 February 1668 by Emperor Leopold I to the rank of Reichsfreiherr [Imperial Baron]. (1661‚Äì1727) was, between 1721 and 1727, the Grand Prior of the Order of St. John ‚Äúin the German lands‚Äù and, in this position, also the Reichsf√ºrst [Imperial Prince] of Heitersheim. On 20 December 1726 was Dietrich Burchard Reichsfreiherr von Merveldt, Councilor and Lord Chamberlain for the Elector of Cologne and the Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster, and all his descendants were raised by Emperor Charles VI to the rank of Reichsgraf [Imperial Count] with the title of Hoch- und Wohlgeboren [‚ÄúHigh and Well-Born‚Äù] and an upgrade for his coat-of-arms. Furthermore, the Lords von Merveldt were awarded the diploma of the Hereditary Marshals of the District of Merveldt in the Principality of M√ºnster by Prussian ceremony in Berlin on 28 December 1846 in primogeniture (for the first-born of the either gender).

Early life  Hungate was born on March 2, 1906 in Cheney, WA, where his father taught biology at the State Normal School at Cheney (now Eastern Washington University) for 46 years. Hungate's father was strongly influenced by his brother-in-law, Charles Piper, and encouraged Hungate's interest in the ecology of Eastern Washington through outings in the local area. Hungate graduated from Cheney Normal in 1924, and served as principal of the Spokane Indian Reservation's elementary school for a year, followed by another two years teaching in Sprague, Washington. He entered Stanford University with the goal of teaching biology at the high school level, but abandoned his plan after his first quarter at Stanford due to his dislike of pedagogy courses and his fellow education students, and instead completed an A.B. in biology magna cum laude in 1929. Hungate had not yet selected a research topic for his Ph.D. before taking C. B. van Niel's first course at Hopkins Marine Station in 1931. Hungate was the only student, and Van Niel's intimate instruction‚ÄîVan Niel sat beside him at a table and sketched illustrations on a yellow notepad, which Hungate kept at the end of the lecture‚Äîwas a turning point in Hungate's scientific career. At Van Niel's suggestion, Hungate selected the symbiotic bacteria of termites as his thesis topic, investigating their role in cellulose digestion. However, he was unsuccessful in his attempts to isolate cellulolytic bacteria from the termite gut because culturing techniques for anaerobic bacteria had not yet been developed, a result that spurred his continued efforts to find methods to do so after he received his Ph.D. in 1935.  Work and discoveries  = Termite biology = Hungate continued his work on the biology of termites after his appointment as lecturer in the Zoology department of the University of Texas, Austin. Hungate first identified the production of as a fermentation product in worker termites, and undertook a study of nitrogen fixation in experimental termite colonies. = Rumen microbiology =  The \\"Hungate\\" method  While investigating the role of cellulolytic protozoa in the rumen of cattle, Hungate isolated a colony of Clostridium cellobioparum, but the difficulty in observing the cellulose clearings they produced in shake tubes spurred him to develop a culturing method using thin agar layers in roll tubes.  Washington State University, Pullman  At the end of the World War II in 1945, Hungate accepted the offer to join the Bacteriology Department at Washington State College (now Washington State University). Hungate‚Äôs laboratory at Washington State University was the first to isolate methanogens using - as an energy source.

After the capture of Beersheba, by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), the Gaza to Beersheba line became increasingly weakened and, seven days later, the EEF successfully forced the Ottoman Turkish Empire's Seventh and Eighth Armies to withdraw. During the following seven days of pursuit, the Turkish forces were pushed back to Jaffa. There followed three weeks of hard fighting in the Judean Hills before Jerusalem was captured on 9 December 1917. During five and a half weeks of almost continuous offensive operations, the EEF captured of territory. After a joint attack by the XX and the Desert Mounted Corps, Beersheba at the eastern end of the Gaza to Beersheba line, was captured. The next day, on 1 November, the Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe began, with an advance north of Beersheba into the Judean foothills, by the 53rd (Welsh) and the ANZAC Mounted Divisions. This move up the road from Beersheba to Jerusalem, also threatened Hebron and Bethlehem. Then, during the night of 1/2 November, the Third Battle of Gaza took place on the Mediterranean coast, when limited attacks by the XXI Corps were made against strongly held, formidable defences. The next day, the fiercely contested fighting south of Tel el Khuweilfe by the EEF was not designed to capture Hebron, but to create sufficient area for the deployment of the XX Corps, for a flank attack on the central defences of the old Gaza to Beersheba line. Fighting for the Beersheba to Jerusalem road, also encouraged the Turkish commanders to deploy their reserves, to hold the EEF threat. On 6 November the Battle of Hareira and Sheria was launched on the centre of the old line, half-way between Gaza and Beersheba, and Hareira was captured; but it was not until late the next day, that the Sheria position was finally captured by the 60th (London) Division, after a failed charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division). The Seventh and the Eighth Armies were by now in full retreat from the remains of the old Gaza to Beersheba line. On 7 November, the second day of the battle for Hareira and Sheria, the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade advanced unopposed through Gaza to attack strong rearguard positions at Wadi el Hesi, which were captured the next day.  Background  On the edge of the Eastern Desert After the first two battles for Gaza, it was obvious to British commanders that large reinforcements were needed \\"to set General Murray's army in motion again.\\"Wavell 1968 p. 89 Indeed, Murray made it clear to the War Cabinet and the Imperial General Staff early in May, that he could not invade Palestine without reinforcements.Keogh 1955 p. 122 The War Office assured him in the same month, that he should prepare to receive reinforcements, which would bring the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) up to six infantry and three mounted divisions.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 360 However by July, when General Edmund Allenby took command of the EEF, 5,150 infantry and 400 yeomanry reinforcements were still needed after the casualties suffered during the battles for Gaza.Allenby to Robertson 12 July 1917 in Hughes 2004 pp. 34‚Äì5 By the end of the 1917 summer in the northern hemisphere, the political and the strategic interests of the British government and the EEF coincided. This was due in part to the failure on the Western Front of the French Republic's Nivelle offensive and the success of the German submarine campaign against British Empire shipping.Downes 1938 p. 660 The destruction of British shipping caused severe shortages in Britain, and although the United States of America had entered the war, their military support would not be apparent for some time. Britain was about to enter a fourth year of extremely costly war, and their Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, appreciated the need to take into account the \\"Home Front.\\" He believed a striking military success could bolster the morale of the civil population, and he told Allenby that \\"he wanted Jerusalem as a Christmas present for the British nation.\\" Lloyd Gorge made clear that this victory was needed in order \\"to strengthen the staying power and morale\\" of Britain.Wavell 1968 p. 96 The British War Cabinet needed a successful Palestine offensive at a time when there was not much good news coming out of the Western Front, and when it was beginning to look like the war could extend into 1919. If they could capture Jerusalem this would put pressure on the Ottoman Empire, which could in turn place a strain on the German alliance, at the same time enhancing Britain's long term aim of strengthening their influence in the Middle East. By the end of October, the EEF was ready to attack.Bruce 2002 p. 116 The decision to launch a major offensive in Palestine, in the autumn of 1917, was also based on \\"very sound strategical reasons.\\" The collapse of the Russian Empire in the spring led to the withdrawal of Russia from the war, as a consequence of the Russian Revolution, and freed up large numbers of Ottoman Empire troops, which had been fighting the Russians on the Eastern Front. These Ottoman units became available to reinforce the Palestine front and were in the process of assembling near Aleppo, along with German soldiers and equipment. They were to launch operations to recapture Baghdad, which had been captured by the British in March. The threat to Baghdad could be more economically opposed by an EEF offensive in southern Palestine. Rather than sending reinforcements to General Frederick S. Maude's Mesopotamian army holding Baghdad, British reinforcements from the Salonika front, which the War Office wanted to scale down, would strengthen the EEF.Wavell 1968 pp. 96‚Äì7 Allenby's strategical objective was a defeat of the Ottoman army in Southern Palestine, decisive enough to ensure Ottoman reinforcements destined for Baghdad were diverted to Palestine. However, by 5 October, General William Robertson, CIGS, telegraphed Allenby that the War Cabinet desired him to eliminate the Ottoman Empire out of the war by a \\"heavy defeat\\", followed by the occupation of the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem line. He was to be supplied with \\"fresh British divisions ... at the rate of one every sixteen days.\\" It was not until after the launching of the offensive that Allenby was told such increases to his force were improbable.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 27 A military railway bridge over the Wadi Ghazzeh, with water storage beyond. EEF horses watered in this vicinity during September and October 1917 Allenby estimated the Ottoman Army could have 20 divisions, with no more than 12 on the front line. However, as these could be replaced by the Ottoman Army, the EEF could not field more than 14 divisions after the doubling of the railway line from Kantara, because of the limitations of the EEF's supply lines. Between April and October 1917, both the EEF and the Ottoman Army laid railways and water pipe lines, and sent troops, guns and huge quantities of ammunition to the front.Cutlack 1941 p. 64 By mid-October 1917, a staff appreciation from London acknowledged the strength of the Ottoman defenders in Southern Palestine, and that any attempt to dislodge them from the Gaza to Beersheba line could cost three divisions. The appreciation acknowledged that \\"[T]he Turk is a stubborn fighter in trenches and we must expect that in any event he will stand long enough to cause us serious loss ... we must be prepared to supply General Allenby with three more divisions\\" to relieve weakened divisions.Erickson 2007 p. 124 = Battlefield = The Gaza to Beersheba line was defended by both sides during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine from April to the end of October 1917. The EEF front line extended for from the Mediterranean coast at Gaza to a point on the Wadi Ghazzeh near El Gamli, about south-west of Sharia and west of Beersheba on the southern edge of the plain of Philistia. On the coast, a strip of sand dunes varying between wide was impassable for wheeled vehicles. Between the sand dunes and the Judean Hills, which rise to , the mainly undulating \\"down-land\\" plains stretched between wide. The plains were intersected by many wadis, which transformed into \\"raging torrents,\\" rushing down from the bare rocky Judaean mountains during the wet winters. The region was sparsely populated, with each village depending on its well for water, while crops of barley were grown. From this area, the topographical conditions of the plain are unchanged for northwards, becoming the Plain of Sharon from Jaffa, to finally end at Mount Carmel near Haifa.Blenkinsop 1925 p. 200  Prelude  The Ottoman Army in Palestine commanded by Marshal Erich von Falkenhayn was nearly 50,000 strong, while General Allenby‚Äôs EEF was 76,000 strong.Jerusalem Memorial 1928 p. 9 = Defending force = Until June 1917, Sheria was the headquarters of the German-commanded defenders holding the Gaza-Beersheba line.Cutlack 1941 p. 57 note In August 1917, the Fourth Army was structured as: * Fourth Army (Syria-Palestine) * 3rd Cavalry Division  VIII Corps * 48th Division  XII Corps * 23rd Division * 44th Division  XV Corps * 43rd Division  XX Corps * 16th Division * 54th Division  XXII Corps * 3rd Division * 7th Division * 53rd DivisionErickson 2001 p. 170 The Fourth Army in Palestine was reorganised into two corps, the XX Corps was expanded from the 16th and 54th Infantry Divisions to include the 178th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Cavalry Division, while the XXII Corps' three divisions remained unchanged.Erickson 2001 p. 163 The XX Corps was headquartered at Huj, while the XXII Corps defended Gaza with the 3rd and 53rd Divisions.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35 By July the Eighth Army commanded by Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein consisting of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division, had an estimated strength of 46,000 rifles, 28,000 sabres and 200 guns.Hill 1978 p. 120Bruce 2002 p. 115  Yildirim Army Group  Ottoman Arab Camel Corps Germany had suggested that six or seven Ottoman divisions released as a consequence of the Russian Army's withdrawal from the war, should attack Mesopotamia with German support. Germany would supply ammunition, equipment, troops and gold along with one of Germany's \\"most distinguished soldiers\\", Erich von Falkenhayn, and an Army Headquarters staff. These German reinforcements included the German Asia Corps, three battalion groups of \\"handpicked and thoroughly trained\\" infantry, very strongly supported by artillery, machine guns, mortars, aircraft and mechanical transport. The Ottoman Empire would contribute a new Seventh Army made up of divisions transferred from the Caucasus and the Balkan fronts.Keogh 1955 pp. 129‚Äì30 Following the formation of the Yildirim Army Group in June 1917, substantial forces were deployed to Syria and Palestine, where they continued to hold the Fourth Army defences. Already in Palestine were the 3rd, 7th, 16th, and 54th Infantry Divisions while the 26th 27th, and 53rd Infantry Divisions arrived during the summer. The 3rd, 7th 16th, and 26th Infantry Divisions had fought in the Gallipoli campaign and the 3rd Cavalry Division had fought in the Caucasian Campaigns. These seven infantry divisions and one cavalry division formed the recently activated Ottoman Eighth Army.Erickson 2007 p. 102Erickson 2001 p. 172 On establishment, the Yildirim Army Group consisted of Ottoman Army troops already in Palestine and Mesopotamia. These included the 19th and the 20th Divisions from Galicia, the 24th and the 42nd Divisions from the Dardanelles, the 48th Division from the Caucasus, the 50th Division from Macedonia and the 59th from Adana in the Gulf of Iskanderun.

Enver Pasha took von Falkenhayn's advice to send the Yildirim Army Group to Palestine, to face the growing threat reported by Kress von Kressenstein. Enver Pasha issued orders on 26 September for the Fourth Army headquarters to move to Damascus, at the same time dividing the area in half, leaving Cemal Pasha with responsibility for Syria and western Arabia. On 2 October, Enver Pasha activated the new Eighth Army, commanded by Kress von Kressenstein, and deployed it along with the Seventh Army, commanded by Mustafa Kemal, to the Yildirim Army Group, commanded by von Falkenhayn. However, in late September Mustafa Kemal disagreed with some of Enver Pasha's decisions and the new command structure. He advised adopting a defensive military policy, in response to the superior British lines of communications, which would ensure continued numerical superiority in any contested theatre. He thought this imbalance would make it impossible for the Yildirim Army Group to go on the offensive. He advised merging the Seventh and the Eighth Armies, offering to step down in favour of Kress von Kressenstein. Several weeks later Mustafa Kemal resigned and Fevzi Pasa took command of the Seventh Army which was still assembling near Aleppo.Erickson 2001 p. 171, 2007 p. 115 By October 1917 the headquarters of the Eighth Army commanded by Kress von Keressenstein was at Huleikat to north of Huj.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 36 These massive reorganisations began to be implemented in October, but by the end of the month, only the headquarters of the Seventh and Eighth Armies were in position to take the field.Erickson 2001 171‚Äì2 On 1 October, the Eighth Army consisted of 2,894 officers, 69,709 men, 29,116 rifles, 403 machine guns, 268 artillery pieces, and 27,575 animals.Erickson 2007 p. 128 Between 10 and 28 October 1917, the Eighth Army shifted three infantry divisions to reserve positions, although the defence of Beersheba remained the responsibility of the Ottoman III Corps, consisting of the mainly Arab 27th Infantry Division, and the 2nd Infantry Regiment \\"minus its machine guns,\\" with the two regiments of the 3rd Cavalry Division.Erickson 2007 p. 117 On 28 October, orders were issued by von Falkenhayn's Yildirim Army Group headquarters, directing Kress von Kressenstein's Eighth Army to assume responsibility for the western, or Gaza half, of the Ottoman front line, while Fevzi Pasa's Seventh Army took responsibility for the eastern half including Beersheba. The III Corps headquarters which commanded the 27th Infantry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division was transferred from the Eighth to the Seventh Army. The 16th and 24th Infantry Divisions and the 19th Infantry Division on its way south were also assigned to the Seventh Army.Erickson 2007 pp. 115‚Äì6 Both the 19th and 24th Divisions arrived before the battle began. Kress von Kressenstein later described the 27th Infantry Division defending Beersheba, as 'badly trained, badly organised, and composed of Arabs who had to be watched'. He recommended the division be deactivated and its soldiers deployed elsewhere as reinforcements. He suggested the 19th Infantry Division, Mustafa Kemal's \\"famous Gallipoli division,\\" replace it at Beersheba. Regarded by the Ottoman General Staff as the most powerful infantry division in the Ottoman Army's order of battle, the 19th Division which had also served in Galicia, had an unusually powerful artillery component. The commander of the Yildirim Army Group, von Falkenhayn, ordered the 19th Infantry Division moved into reserve near Cemame [Jemame?] nearer to Gaza than Beersheba. By 31 October, nine Ottoman infantry divisions and one cavalry division with a total strength of up to 45,000 rifles, 1,500 sabres and 300 guns defended the Gaza to Beersheba line. Gaza was defended by the Eighth Army's XXII Corps, with its XX Corps defending Sheria, while the Seventh Army's III Corps defended Beersheba. The recently arrived commander of the Seventh Army, Fevzi Pasha, \\"played no active role in command during the early stages of the third battle of Gaza and the entire front remained under Kress's control.\\"Bruce 2002 p. 125  Assault battalions  Each infantry division was reorganised into three infantry regiments, each consisting of three infantry battalions, and one assault battalion. The specialised assault or storm troop divisions of the German Army were never formed by the Ottoman Army.Erickson 2007 pp. 104‚Äì5 However, the assault battalions were established by order of Enver Pasha on 1 September 1917, during a general activation of Sto√ütruppen style assault troops, across the whole Ottoman Army. The XV Corps, the First Army and the Fourth Army established the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Assault Battalions respectively. In addition, Enver Pasha ordered each infantry division in the Yildirim Army Group and in the Fourth Army, to establish assault detachments consisting of the best officers, NCOs, and men from the best units in the division. These soldiers were required to be 27 years old or younger, intelligent, healthy and strong. Each assault unit was given a one-month assault course, better rations, and a badge embroidered with a hand grenade.Erickson 2007 p. 104  Aircraft  During October, 56 aircraft in Nos. 301, 302, 303 and 304 Squadrons of the German Flying Corps, arrived in Palestine from Germany. At the time No. 14 (Ottoman) Squadron's A.E.G. two-seaters, were stationed at Kutrani.Cutlack 1941 p. 81 Characteristics It has also been claimed that after \\"Russia's collapse in 1917\\" that reinforcements needed in Palestine were sent to the Caucasus, leaving the Ottoman army low in morale. In describing the situation, Hughes writes that \\"many had received no mail from home in years. The hapless Turkish recruits awaited the EEF assault in 'fragile tents' with 'nothing to cheer their spirits'.\\"Hughes 1999 p. 51 This was because \\"the condition of the Ottoman railway system was such that the Turks had difficulty maintaining any substantial force in Palestine either for defensive or offensive operations.\\" Based on a single track for 1,275 miles, with sections of standard and narrow gauge, the Ottoman lines of communication have been described as \\"appalling.\\"Hughes 1999 p. 54 The Ottoman Army in Palestine in 1917 continued to demonstrate most of the characteristics they had during the first two years of war. The army was operationally and tactically aggressive, executing both defensive and offensive operations and training continuously in realistic, up-to-date methods at troop level and in centralised settings. According to Erickson, \\"[d]ivisions were task-organised\\" for a variety of \\"specific tactical missions.\\" The commanders were experienced, highly trained and capable leaders who \\"continued to function well in its third year of a multi-front total war.\\"Erickson 2007 p. 109 However, it has also been claimed that the Ottoman front line infantry battalions were \\"operating at about half strength.\\" The 21st Infantry Regiment on 26 October, according to the Turkish General Staff Archives was claimed to be \\"at half strength in trained men\\" and reinforcements were failing to keep up with \\"sick and battle casualties.\\" Their last battle had been a decisive victory seven months previous, in April, from behind strong fortifications. Captain H√ºseyin H√ºsn√º Emir, Assistant Chief of Staff of the Yildirim Army Group, claimed the 16th Division which had 200 officers, 400 NCOs and 10,900 men in September 1916, had been reduced to only 5,017 officers and men by 15 October 1917. Then the \\"three infantry battalions in its 78th Infantry Regiment numbered about 400 men each (out of an authorisation of about 750 men per battalion).\\" He also claimed that every division in the Gaza defences was below strength by 50 per cent, but there is no mention of the establishment of assault battalions. In addition, chronic failures due to casualties and manpower shortages, were reported as being \\"compounded by terrible attrition from disease and desertion.\\" On 3 August 1917, the Yildirim Army Group reported \\"a deficit of some 70,000 soldiers\\", and that even the proposed reinforcements would leave them 40,000 short.Erickson 2007 pp. 105, 107‚Äì8, 109 According to Hussein Husni's Yilderim, \\"in September 1917 Mustafa Kemal, the commander of the Seventh army in Palestine, reported to Enver Pasha that 50 per cent of the arriving 54th division were either too young or old; [no source] a battalion of one of the best divisions left Istanbul 1,000 strong, only to arrive at Aleppo with 500 men. [note 76 Hussein Husni, Yilderim, Part 1, Chapter 4 (also appendix 16).] \\"Hughes 1999 p. 55 According to Massey, rations and leadership amongst the divisions facing the British Empire troops were also poor, writing \\"if the...[Ottoman Army]...had been well led and properly rationed,\\" the Ottoman 3rd, 7th, 16th, 19th, 20th, 24th, 26th, 27th, 53rd, and 54th Divisions and the 3rd Cavalry Division, should have been able to resist more strongly.Massey 1919 p. 12  Gaza-Beersheba line  Western section of the Gaza‚ÄìBeersheba Line After April, the defences at Gaza had been strengthened. Many of the houses were built on a ridge, each with its own garden surrounded by high cactus hedges, enclosing an area at least deep. Along with this formidable area the of trenching west of the town needed to be attacked by infantry as Allenby did not have enough artillery to do the job.Massey 1919 p. 15 Both Sheria and Beersheba were particularly strongly fortified by the Ottoman force, permanent strongly entrenched and wired positions were constructed from the sea at Gaza to Shellal on the Wadi Ghazzeh, defended by infantry.Preston 1921 p. 12Woodward 2006 pp. 87‚Äì8 An Ottoman appreciation stated that due to lack of water any attack on Beersheba could only be made by one cavalry and one infantry division.Downes 1938 p. 661Based on an 11 November 1917 report by Major Pardoe titled \\"Turkish Machine Gun Defences and Emplacements\\" it has been claimed \\"Gaza's defences were so weak that Allenby should have concentrated his cavalry opposite Gaza and made his main attack there, and ignored or, at most, launched a diversionary attack on Beersheba.\\" [Hughes 1999 p. 50] The well-sited Ottoman defences relied on entrenched Ottoman soldiers ready to take every opportunity to counterattack. Both Gaza and Beersheba were virtually ringed by fortifications. An attack was expected by the EEF and the Ottoman Army knew about EEF preparations for an attack. The strength of the Yildirim Army Group units holding the Gaza to Beersheba line was estimated at 40,000 rifles, although the figure was later found to be closer to 33,000 rifles, 1,400 sabres and 260 guns, including the reserve 19th Division at 'Iraq el Menshiye, and the 12th Depot Regiment at Hebron.These figures do not mention machine guns. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35] While both Sheria and Beersheba were particularly strongly fortified by the Ottoman defenders, there were permanent strongly entrenched and wired positions stretching from the sea at Gaza to Shellal on the Wadi Ghazzeh. On 31 October, the defenders of the Gaza to Beersheba line had been increased to nine divisions and one cavalry division.Wavell 1968 p. 114 The Yildirim Army Group's pre‚Äìbattle deployment saw the Gaza‚ÄìBeersheba line held by two field armies \\"abreast.\\" On the right, the Eighth Army with headquarters at Huleikat north of Huj deployed, :XXII Corps commanded by Refet Bey with headquarters at Jebaliye holding the strongly fortified positions around Gaza with the 3rd, 53rd Divisions :XX Corps commanded by Ali Fuad Bey with headquarters at Huj held Sheria with the 16th, 26th, 54th Divisions, holding the line eastwards with the 26th and 54th Divisions :Army Reserve at Deir Sneid the 7th Division and the 19th Division, which was either at Iraq el Menshiye north of beersheba and north‚Äìeast of Gaza, or at an assembly area behind the front.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 35‚Äì6 Gaza had been developed into a strong fortress, heavily entrenched and wired. Stretching from the Mediterranean Sea on either side of Gaza a series of strong groups of positions at Sihan, Atawineh, Abu Hariera- Arab el Teeaha and Beersheba, ran eastwards for to a point south of Sharia. Extending across the railway, these groups of defensive positions had \\"every advantage of observation over the long bare slopes which an attacker must cross.\\" Beyond these main positions there was a gap of about to the defences at Beersheba where the desert country, minimized the threat of an EEF attack. However strong defences had been developed to the west and south‚Äìwest of Beersheba with a garrison from the Seventh Army of 5,000 protecting its important wells, supported by a number of high entrenched hills around Beersheba.Massey 1919 p. 26 Beersheba end of the Gaza‚ÄìBeersheba Line The Seventh Army on the left, commanded by Fevzi Pasha was deployed ‚Äì :III Corps at Kauwukah or in XX Corps reserve near Kh. Jemmame east of Huj (24th Division) at Beersheba (27th, 16th Divisions, 3rd Cavalry Division) also at Beersheba. Beersheba was defended by the Ottoman 27th Division, reinforced by battalions from the 16th and 24th Divisions.Gullett 1941 p. 384 Here, the fortifications consisted of two lines of defensive positions. The outer line circled the town from the Gaza to Beersheba road where the line passed through the high ground to the north‚Äìwest of Beersheba before continuing to the west and south‚Äìwest of Beersheba, to Ras Ghannam. Situated on average about from Beersheba, this semi‚Äìcircle of defences was heavily entrenched and wired. To the north‚Äìeast, east and south‚Äìeast the outer line of defences consisted of a series redoubts or strong posts on the high ground at Tel el Sakaty and Tel el Saba, along with two stone block‚Äìhouses defending the north bank of the Wadi Saba. The second inner line of defences completely encircled Beersheba the town itself, crossing the Wadi Saba just to the south of the railway bridge.Preston 1921 p. 20 Before the battle, Kress von Kressenstein recommended that the wells at Beersheba be destroyed and the garrison withdrawn to the hills north of the town, because he considered there were not enough troops to successfully defend Beersheba. He argued that from the hills to the north, the Beersheba garrison could attack the flank of any EEF units moving against Hareira and Sheria, but von Falkenhayn rejected this advice.Keogh 1955 p. 140 = Attacking force = The EEF had been reorganized and strengthened during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine to overcome the strongly reinforced and entrenched Ottoman forces holding the Gaza to Beersheba line.Blenkinsop 1925 p.199 Allenby was directed by the War Cabinet to \\"strike the Turks as hard as possible,\\" and defeat hostile forces wherever they opposed the EEF. He was to commence the offensive as \\"early as possible in September\\" before the Ottoman Army could redeploy their forces after the withdrawal of Russia from the war. Robertson assured Allenby was assured that \\"everything possible\\" was being done to bring the EEF back to full strength and fully supplied with munitions. However there was \\"no prospect at present of being able to send you the further reinforcements ... required for operations beyond the line Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem.\\"Robertson CIGS to Allenby 10 August quoted in Hughes 2004 p. 52 By this time the EEF was competing for finite British resources, which were being restricted by the very successful German submarine attacks which destroyed British ships and supplies, with the Third Battle of Ypres which had commenced on 31 July. However, more artillery was in transit, and the doubling of the railway had been authorised on 21 July.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 14‚Äì15 The fighting strength of the EEF was 100,189: :Desert Mounted Corps 745 officers, 17,935 other ranks in the Anzac, Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions :XX Corps 1,435 officers, 44,171 other ranks in the 10th, 53rd, 60th and 74th Divisions :XXI Corps 1,154 officers, 34,759 other ranks in the 52nd, 54th and 75th Divisions.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 660‚Äì1 The force consisted of: XX Corps (Lieutenant General Sir R.W.

Massey 2007 p. 7 The official rifle strength of the EEF on 28 October 1917, was 80,000 in the infantry divisions and the Imperial Camel Brigade, and 15,000 cavalry including the mounted rifles and mounted infantry brigades.Half the brigades in Desert Mounted Corps were light horse and mounted rifle brigades armed only with rifle and bayonet. [Keogh 1955 pp. 125‚Äì6] However the \\"actual strength ... [was] about 60,000 and 12,000 respectively.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35 note This represented a comparable ratio of 2:1 infantry, 8:1 cavalry and about 3:2 guns.It has been claimed that the EEF had 17,000 sabres while the Ottoman cavalry had 1,500. [Young 1986 pp. 2390‚Äì1] The numbers of machine guns have not been included by the sources. Most of Allenby's infantry were Territorial divisions, mobilised at the outbreak of the war with most, if not all the battalions having some regular army officers and NCOs. A number of the divisions had fought against the Ottoman Army, during the Gallipoli Campaign. The 52nd (Lowland) Division at Cape Helles, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 54th (East Anglian) Division fought at Suvla Bay, while the 60th (2nd/2nd London) Division had fought on the western front and at Salonika. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division recently formed from was 18 under‚Äìstrength Yeomanry regiments had all fought dismounted at Gallipoli. The 10th (Irish) Division, a New Army (K1) division had also fought at Suvla Bay and at Salonika.Erickson 2007 pp. 111‚Äì2 All three of the brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division and the two light horse brigades of the Australian Mounted Division had fought the Ottoman Army on Gallipoli.Erickson overlooks the Sinai and Palestine campaign. The 52nd (Lowland) Division fought at the Romani on the Sinai peninsula and the First and the Second Battle of Gaza, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, along with the 54th (East Anglian) Division fought at the First and the Second Battles of Gaza, while the Anzac Mounted Division fought at Romani, Magdhaba, Rafa, the First and Second Battle of Gaza. Allenby agreed that he would take the offensive as soon as arrangements were complete and he had seven infantry divisions ready for action.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 17 During October Allenby was waiting \\"for reinforcements from England.\\"Pugsley 2004 p. 139 On 17 October Allenby wrote to Robertson that the 75th Division was complete but the 10th (Irish) Division had about 3,000 cases of fever and lacked its \\"B\\" echelon of its Divisional Ammunition Column. He was hopeful that the Irish division would be complete and able to field between 8,000 and 9,000 rifles \\"on the day.\\" In addition Allenby had been in close touch with the naval captains, while waiting for reinforcements, to ensure they had personally reconnoitred their sea and land so they \\"know exactly what to do.\\"Allenby to Robertson 17 October 1917 in Hughes 2004 p. 66‚Äì7  Aircraft  The Army Wing aircraft were assigned to carry out strategic reconnaissances, to report on Ottoman reserves well behind their lines, and carry out photography duties and air raids. Army fighter squadron was to provide protection from hostile air attack, while the Army bombing squadron was prepared to conduct bombing air raids. The Corps Squadrons of aircraft attached to the two infantry corps, carried out artillery and contact patrols, along with tactical reconnaissance. Photography of the opposition's trenches was normally carried out daily by the Army Wing. One flight of aircraft attached to XX Corps, was responsible for carrying out artillery and contact patrols and tactical reconnaissances for Desert Mounted Corps.Massey 1919 p. 120 Appendix VI Force Order 22 October 1917 As well as the arrival of British troops, all types of war material along with heavy guns, motor transport, up-to-date fast aircraft replaced the slow aircraft, which had been outpaced by the German Fokker and Albatross Scout aircraft. The first of the new R.E.8s arrived at No. 1 Squadron on 17 October along with new Martinsydes, fitted with a 160-hp engine instead of the old 120-hp engines. As a result, control of the air gradually moved to the EEF from the Ottoman Army, which had held it since the Sinai campaign.Powles 1922 p. 122Downes 1938 p. 628Cutlack 1941 pp. 76‚Äì7 New Bristol Fighter aircraft arrived in ones and twos to establish No. 111 Squadron RFC which was shortly followed by No. 113 Squadron RFC, which took over corps operations, and to relieve No. 1 Squadron of some trench reconnaissances, as it in turn became a specialist bombing squadron. New pilots and observers from the training school, reported to the squadrons and in August, No. 1 Squadron was authorised by A.I.F. Headquarters, to hold a reserve of fifty per cent of flying officers above establishment. The full value of this provision not become fully utilised until the air war of 1918.Cutlack 1941 p. 74  Sherifial Forces  Allenby was hopeful that Lawrence and the Sherifial Arab force could support a September attack, recognising that they were involved with harvests before September, but \\"must get going before the end of September\\" prior to their normal move to camel grazing lands in the Syrian desert. \\"They, naturally, won't and can't do much unless I move; and it is not much use their destroying the Turks' communications unless I take immediate advantage of such destruction ... If I bring them into the fight and do not make progress myself, this will also expose them to retaliation ‚Äì which to some tribes, such as the Druzes, S. of Damascus, may mean annihilation.\\"Allenby to Robertson 19 July 1917 quoted in Hughes 2004 p. 41  Supplies  Allenby's strategic plans for the capture of the Beersheba line and the eventual capture of Jerusalem, required the complete determination of the commander, and efficient supply lines to support the mobility of his force. The offensive relied completely on efficient lines of communication.Wavell 1968 p. 239 In order for two divisions to cross the arid country to attack Beersheba, elaborate arrangement for the supply of water, food and ammunition were necessary. Indeed the absence of water dictated that the attack had to be decisive, otherwise the mounted divisions would be forced to withdraw to water.Keogh 1955 pp. 135‚Äì6 However, a series reconnaissances and work by field engineers in the apparently waterless desert, based on intelligence produced sufficient water, to the west of Beersheba for the horses, and the horses circling to the south in a wide arch.Bou 2009 pp. 171‚Äì2The infantry attacked from the west. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 sketch map 1 Situation at 18:00 28 October 1917] Records of the Palestine Exploration Society revealed that Khalasa had been the site of the Greek city of Eleusa, south west of Beersheba and that Asluj had been a large town, south of Beersheba. The likelihood of finding water at these two places was investigated by the Commander of the Royal Engineers, Desert Mounted Corps and confirmed during discussions with the inhabitants of the area. Plans were made to develop these water sources.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 23 A 48-hour reconnaissance from Tel el Fara was carried out from 23 to 25 September to survey the roads and water in the Esani and Khalasa areas.11th Light Horse Regiment War Diary September 1917 AWM4-10-16-24 During the night of 20/21 October units of the XX Corps were sent forward to form supply dumps and to store water at Esani while Desert Mounted Corps engineers developed water at Khalasa and Asluj which had previously been reconnoitred by them. The standard gauge line to Imara was completed and the station opened on 28 October. The railway line was extended to a point north-north-east of Karm and a station opened there on 3 November. The light railway from the east bank of the wadi Ghazzeh at Gamli via Karm to Khasif was completed on 30 October. Between 22 October and 1 November water at Mendur to Sheik Ajilin was developed by the XXI Corps, at Esani, Imara, Karm and Khasif by the XX Corps and at Abu Ghalyun, Malaga, Khalassa and Asluj by Desert Mounted Corps. Cisterns in the Khasif and Imsiri area were filled with 60,000 gallons of water for the 53rd and 74th Divisions, to be supplemented by camel convoys.Massey 1919 p. 27Blenkinsop 1925 p. 201 After the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved to Bir el Esani and the ICCB to Abu Ghalyun, the work continued night and day on the development of water. These two brigades were supported by the field squadrons of the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions. Allenby personally inspected the watering points at Shellal works and watched the engineers cleaning out the wells at Khalassa and Asluj. His surprise arrival and keen interest gave those carrying out the difficult, dirty work a sense of the importance Allenby attached to their work.Keogh 1955 pp. 151‚Äì2Powles 1922 pp. 132‚Äì3 Regarding the importance of water, historian Matthew Hughes wrote: \\"[w]ater was the determining factor in the success or otherwise of Allenby's plan at the third battle of Gaza.\\"The return of the Australian Mounted Division to water at Karm has been describes as negating \\"the whole purpose of the flanking operation ... the attempt to cut off the enemy forces had failed\\" due to delays caused by water difficulties. [Hughes 1999 p. 57] Allenby acknowledged the problem on 21 August, saying \\"[t]he wells will probably be blown\\". He believed that there would be \\"some water\\" in the Wadi es Saba and Wadi el Imaleh but he was uncertain of the amount, acknowledging that it was \\"...the driest time of the year.\\"Allenby to Robertson 21 August 1917 in Hughes 2004 p. 54 Fortunately for the British plan, though, thunderstorms on 25 October had left pools of water over a wide area.Gullett 1941 pp. 406‚Äì7 While all possible steps were taken to ensure full and regular supplies, Allenby's administrative instructions included the following caveat: \\"[t]hese calculations are based on the scale of full mobile rations. It may be necessary to double all distances and to place the force on half rations.\\"Wavell 1968 p. 240 Nevertheless, Hughes notes that \\"without the water at Beersheba the cavalry was reliant on the rail terminals at Karm or even Rafah.\\"Hughes 1999 p. 58 = XX and XXI Corps transport = There was not enough transport to keep both the XX and the XXI Corps in the field at the same time. As a result, most of the lorries, tractors (excepting ammunition tractors), and camels of the XXI Corps holding the Gaza sector, were withdrawn and transferred to strengthen XX Corps' supply in the Beersheba sector, \\"striking flank.\\" The movement of the XXI Corps transport to Shellal and Karm, along with the extension of the railway to Karm, was delayed until the last moment, to avoid drawing attention to that section of the front line.Keogh 1955 p. 136Massey 1919 p. 24Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 21 Meanwhile, dumps of rations, ammunition and engineer stores were formed in the XXI Corps area in concealed positions.Keogh 1955 p. 137 31 October to 7 November =Capture of the Gaza-Beersheba line= Force Order No. 54 by Allenby states on 22 October that it was his intention to \\"take the offensive\\" at Beersheba and Gaza, then make an \\"enveloping attack\\" towards Hareira and Sheria.Falls 1930 Vol 2 p. 676 \\"Allenby turned the Turks out of their defensive positions,\\"Erickson 2007 p. 97 the Gaza-Beersheba line was completely overrun, and 12,000 Ottoman soldiers were captured or surrendered. The subsequent advance would take the EEF to Jerusalem on 9 December.Carver 2003 p. 223Woodward 2006 p. 147 Allenby describes the capture of Beersheba in his report written on in the evening after the battle: Although the Ottoman defenders suffered many casualties at Beersheba, \\"stubborn fighting continued\\" against strong Ottoman rearguards, which delayed an EEF breakthrough for seven days.Wavell quoted in Erickson 2007 p. 124 The continuation of the offensive so far from base depended on efficiently supplying the attacking force. The Australian Mounted Division was supplied by their divisional train which brought supplies to them at Beersheba on 2 November.Also on 2 November the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent a letter to the most prominent Jew in Britain, Baron Rothschild a wealthy banker and head of the British branch of European Jewish causes. The letter known as the Balfour Declaration, proposed a national home for the Jewish People in Palestine, was published in The Times on 9 November 1917. [Grainger 2006 p. 178] On 31 October the Australian Mounted Divisional Train moved back from Esani to Gamli, where they loaded supplies before heading out for Reshid Beck where they arrived at 17:00 on 1 November. Departing at 09:30 on 2 November, they moved along the long dusty wadi Salia towards Beersheba via Hill 1070. The divisional train halted for a meal and rest when the animals were fed, before continuing on to arrive at Beersheba and bivouac at 20:00. At 08:00 on 3 November, they began offloading the supplies.Australian Mounted Divisional Train War Diary, November 1917 AWM4-25-20-5 = Medical situation = The ambulance stretcher bearers following closely behind the regiments collected the wounded where they fell. The first divisional collecting station was formed by mobile sections at Khasm Zanna, some east of Beersheba at 12:30. When this was full, at 19:00 second was formed nearer Beersheba. The 165 wounded from the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions were retained overnight. These wounded were transferred to the Ottoman hospital in Beersheba which was taken over after the operating unit and the Australian Mounted Division receiving station arrived at 07:00 on 1 November. The Anzac Mounted Division receiving station and convoy cars in reserve, arrived at 11:00 when evacuation was to Imara by Motor Ambulance Convoy and light (Ford) motor ambulance wagons began. On 2 November the XX Corps took over the Ottoman hospital when the Australian Mounted Division receiving station, transferred to the town hall where wounded from the fighting in the hills north of the city started to arrive.Downes 1938 pp. 663‚Äì4  Southern Judean Hills towards Hebron  For a week, the Ottoman defenders continued to hold most of the old Gaza to Beersheba line after the capture of Beersheba, including Sheria, and Gaza along with Tank and Atawineh redoubts.Keogh p. 161 \\"It was not water so much as strong defence and cool action under fire by the enemy which held its line for seven days after the fall of Beersheba which allowed its army to retire in an orderly fashion.\\"Keogh 1955 p. 161 However recent histories have remained focused on the issue of water. \\"Water was the determining factor in the success or otherwise of Allenby's plan at the third battle of Gaza.\\"Hughes 1999 p. 56 Indeed, the return of the Australian Mounted Division to water at Karm has been describes as negating \\"the whole purpose of the flanking operation ... the attempt to cut off the enemy forces had failed\\" due to delays caused by water difficulties.Hughes 1999 p. 57 After the loss of Beersheba, the Ottoman defenders withdrew north north west towards Tel esh Sheria and northwards towards Tel el Khuweilfe.Bou 2009 p. 176Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 108 Those who retired northward were to defend the Seventh Army headquarters at Hebron and the road north to Jerusalem less than away. Here a considerable Ottoman force, including all available reserve units, were deployed in the Tel el Kuweilfeh area to face strong attacks by the Anzac Mounted Division. These attacks which began the day after Beersheba was captured, were strongly resisted during the Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe by the Ottoman defenders who feared a major cavalry attack.Grainger 2006 p. 135Dalbiac 1927 p. 125  Mediterranean coast  During the Third Battle of Gaza, several attacks were made by the XXI Corps by the 52nd (Lowland), the 54th (East Anglian) and the 75th Divisions.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 67‚Äì8, 71, 664‚Äì5 The main purpose of these operations was to keep the Ottoman garrison of 8,000 riflemen supported by 116 guns in place. The XXI Corps launched an attack at 23:00 during the night of 1/2 November towards Umbrella Hill. The second attack a few hours later at 03:00 was launched towards the El Arish Redoubt.Woodward 2006 pp. 111‚Äì2Cutlack 1941 p. 79Erickson 2001 p. 173 These attacks, which concentrated on a long section of the defences between Umbrella Hill and the coast, aimed to capture three groups of trench complexes or redoubts, called el Arish, Rafa, and Cricket by the EEF. These fortifications were strongly connected by a \\"series of trench lines several layers thick, and backed by other trenches and strongpoints.\\"Grainger 2006 pp. 124‚Äì5 During these attacks, which were never intended to capture Gaza, just the first line of Ottoman trenches, the XXI Corps utilised new infantry tactics, and were supported by tanks and a large quantity of artillery, organised according to a western front-style of deployment.Erickson 2007 p. 123  In the centre  Ottoman Artillery at Hareira The main flank attack on the Ottoman front line stretching from Gaza, was made on 6 November by the EEF in the centre at Hareira and Sheria, and a gap was created for the Desert Mounted Corps to advance to capture Huj on their way to the Mediterranean coast.Grainger 2006 pp. 136‚Äì7Dalbiac 1927 p. 124 However, there were less than 8,000 horsemen available out of the 17,000 in Desert Mounted Corps.Grainger 2006 pp. 150‚Äì1 Only three light horse and one mounted brigades were immediately available on 7 November to participate in the breakthrough. They were the 1st and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades (Anzac Mounted Division), the 4th Light Horse and the 5th Mounted Brigades while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division), waited to be relieved from outpost work connecting the XX and the XXI Corps.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 86, 111‚Äì2, note p. 112 Desert Mounted Corps‚Äô strength had been cut by one third by the decision to leave the Yeomanry Mounted Division, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, and the 11th and the 12th Light Armoured Car Batteries in the Judean Hills supporting the 53rd (Welsh) Division attacks at Tel el Khuweilfe. The Anzac Mounted Division was also less two squadrons and machine guns, and most of the Division's Field Squadron Australian Engineers which were still working to improve the amount of water flowing from the Beersheba wells.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 111‚Äì2, note p. 112 Tel es Sheria bridge By 09:00 the Australian Mounted Division (less one brigade) was to connect at Kh. Buteihah with the Anzac Mounted Division which was steadily pushing back Ottoman posts to gain space for manoeuvre.Egyptian Expeditionary Force War Diary 7 November 1917 AWM4-1-6-19part2 However, the Australian Mounted Division was not in a position to advance until after dark, because of delays in the capture of Tel esh Sheria.Bruce 2002 p. 142 After participating in the unsuccessful charge, the horses of the 11th Light Horse Regiment were watered at 06:00 at the Sheria Water Tower on 8 November, where the regiment was issued with rations and forage from their B1 echelon's special emergency rations. At 07:30 the 4th Light Horse Brigade informed the regiment that the brigade was moving at 09:00 in a northerly direction up the Wadi Sudeh.11th Light Horse Regiment November 1917 AWM4-10-16-26 The 4th Light Horse Brigade concentrated south of Tel el Sheria and the 12th Light Horse Regiment moved off with the brigade northwards. Ottoman columns were reported retreating northwards from Atawineh towards Huj and Beit Hanun at midnight 7/8 November.12th Light Horse Regiment November 1917 AWM4-10-17-10 Meanwhile the opposing forces fighting for the Khuweilfeh Ridge, continued their long drawn-out struggle on 7 November without much change. Towards the evening the Ottoman forces began to withdraw, to conform with a general retirement along the length of the whole Ottoman defensive line, including Gaza and Sheria.Wavell 1968 pp. 136‚Äì7 At Gaza, a series of EEF infantry attacks during the night of 6 November were not strongly resisted and when a general advance occurred during the morning of 7 November the town was found to have been abandoned.Preston 1921 p. 48 The town which had a population of 40,000 people before the war, was completely deserted.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 75Moore 1920 p. 67 By that evening, although not many prisoners had been captured \\"the enemy had been ejected from strong positions\\" which had been held successfully against the EEF for eight months.Hill 1978 p. 130  Ottoman withdrawal  The Ottoman XXII Corps was not defeated, but had skilfully conducted a tactical retreat from Gaza, demonstrating both operational and tactical mobility.Erickson 2007 pp. 124‚Äì5 Nor did the Yildirim Army Group attempt a strong counterattack. The Seventh Army commanded by Mustafa Kemal and the Eighth Army commanded by Kress von Kressenstein were instead ordered to \\"conduct a fighting withdrawal,\\" with the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division screening the left flank of the Seventh Army. While the headquarters of Yildirim Army Group retired back to Jerusalem the headquarters of the Seventh Army retired back from Hebron to Bethlehem. A new defensive line north of Gaza had begun to be established, before disengaging their forces to withdraw during the night. Numerous rearguards covered the disengagement when many Ottoman troops died or were captured defending these rearguards. Under pressure from the main EEF advance in the centre and along the coast towards the Eighth Army, Kress von Kressenstein had great difficulty maintaining control and cohesion. By 9 November the Eighth Army had retreated while the Seventh Army had lost hardly any ground.Erickson 2001 p. 173 = Rearguards = Situation as known to General Headquarters of the EEF at 18:00 7 November 1917 Although they had been retiring during the two previous nights, they strongly resisted, fighting the EEF mounted divisions on the intervening day. Rearguards formed by groups ranging in size from a company to several regiments, occupied every tell or other commanding ground to establish a strong rearguard position, from which they fought \\"tenaciously.\\"Preston 1921 p. 51 Many Ottoman troops died or were captured defending their rearguards, but the sacrifice of the Ottoman rearguards delayed the EEF advance and saved the Eighth Army from encirclement and destruction.Erickson p. 173 After they evacuated Gaza, the Ottoman 53rd Division was ordered to advance across the front, passed Huj to stop Desert Mounted Corps' breakout. They attacked leading squadrons of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade which were driven in, before attacking the 7th Mounted Brigade on their left, which stopped the advance. However when threatened by the 1st Light Horse Brigade on the right, the 53rd Division withdrew to the Wadi Hesi, but the delay to the mounted advance allowed the 16th and 26th Divisions to escape capture.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp.117‚Äì8 By the evening the Anzac Mounted Division reached Tel Abu Dilakh, the Australian Mounted Division on their left with the 60th (London) Division on their left.Massey 1919 p. 42 The breakthrough was only partial as strong well organised counterattacks blocked the mounted divisions at Tel Abu Dilakh, north of Tel esh Sheria and on the Wadi el Hesi line enabling the rearguards from the Atawineh, Tank and Beer defences to withdrawal. This disciplined withdrawal succeeded in preventing a rout, but the Ottoman defences were now only rudimentary and could not stop Desert Mounted Corps for long.Grainger 2006 pp. 152‚Äì3 Two factors influenced the speed of the EEF advance, the frequent counterattacks and water. It was known that water was available at Bir Jamameh, at Tel el Jejile and Huj.Preston 1921 p. 44 However only part of the Desert Mounted Corps was armed for mounted attack. \\"But the fact that only two of the six brigades available were armed with the sword undoubtedly affected their tactics and pace in dealing with the opposition of the Turkish rearguards.\\"Wavell 1968 p. 149Wavell is probably including both the 5th and 7th Mounted Brigades and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade which did not rejoin Desert Mounted Corps from Tel el Khuweilfe until 12 November, two days after the Yeomanry Mounted Division. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 124] During 7 November, the Australian Mounted Division was delayed by strong Ottoman rearguards during the Battle of Hareira and Sheria near Sheria, while only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division were available to advance and threaten the Ottoman withdrawal, which continued unaffected. Chauvel requested the return of the Yeomanry Mounted Division to the Desert Mounted Corps.Hill 1978 p. 132  Pursuit 7 to 16 November  However, recent historians have overlooked the successful allied campaign of manoeuvre which resulted in the capture of Jerusalem,Hughes 1999 pp. 55‚Äì59 claiming the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918, was the \\"only successful allied campaign of manoeuvre in the entire Great War.\\" The pursuit was hampered by problems with watering horses, lack of supplies, both of which were exacerbated by a khamsin, the hot southerly wind that stirred up clouds of dust and sand. One hundred motor lorries carrying full water tanks shuttled between Beersheba and Karm away.Smith p. 85 Insufficient water and the frequent counter-attacks, which were most often directed against the right of the advancing mounted corps from the foothills of the Judean Hills, were the two major factors which slowed the pursuit.Powles p. 143 = 7 November = The Anzac Mounted Division (less the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade still attached to Barrow's detachment with the 53rd (Welsh) Division near Khuweilfe) received orders to advance to Ameidat on 7 November.Keogh 1955 p. 160 They pushed through a gap in the Ottoman defensive line at Kh. Umm el Bakr. This gap had been created when the defenders closed up towards Tel esh Sheria and Tel el Khuweilfe. They rode to Umm el Ameidat, north west of Tel esh Sheria station on the Beersheba to Junction Station railway without being opposed for the first couple of miles. As the lead brigade, the 1st Light Horse Brigade moved in open formation over the plain they were shelled by Ottoman artillery from the west and north-west. As the 1st Light Horse Brigade approached the station at 11:00, the leading regiment were fired on. Instead of dismounting to the attack, they charged into the place which was captured after a \\"sharp fight,\\" along with large supply and ammunition depots.Preston 1921 p. 45‚Äì6Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 112‚Äì4 At Ameidat they captured 396 prisoners and 27 trucks loaded with ammunition, ordnance stores including arms and saddlery.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 113 From their position behind the old Ottoman front line the Anzac Mounted Division was shelled from the Judean Hills on their right and the Ottoman heavy guns firing from Sheria and Atawineh redoubts on the left. These Ottoman guns also fired on the XX and XXI Corps covering the country in shrapnel, smoke and dust.Powles 1922 pp. 142‚Äì3 At noon patrols from the Anzac Mounted Division rode out from Ameidat north towards Tel en Nejil away on the railway, and north-west towards Kh. Jemmame on the Wadi Jammame also away. Half an hour later they were informed that Gaza had fallen and the division was urged to attempt to cut off the retreat of the Gaza garrison by advancing to Kh. Jemmame although the centre of the line around Hareira and Atawineh was still held by Ottoman rearguards.Powles 1922 p. 143 Both patrols were stopped by Ottoman rearguards, a very strong one was located on the Tel Abu Dilakh half way to Kh. Jemmame. Although the 2nd Light Horse Brigade rode forward to support the 1st Light Horse Brigade's attack on the Tel at 15:00, and the combined force of the two brigades pushed the defenders back off the hill, the rearguard took up another strong position a short distance to the north. Although there was no water available, the Anzac Mounted Division bivouacked near Ameidat holding a battle outpost line stretching from Abu Dilakh to east of the railway. During the night scouts from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (after being relieved from the outpost line connecting the XX with the XXI Corps) found touch with the Anzac Mounted Division near Abu Dilakh,Preston 1921 p. 46 and the 7th Mounted Brigade was sent to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division, as the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was still in the Tel el Khuweilfe area with the 53rd (Welsh) Division.Chauvel has been criticised for not ordering the Australian Mounted Division to join the Anzac Mounted Division's advance which would have placed the 4th Light Horse Brigade in a position to make the Charge at Sheria from the flank. [Baly 2003 p. 125] = 7‚Äì8 November = Beit Hanun and Wadi el Hesi It has been claimed the XXI Corps had no cavalry to \\"pursue\\" the retreating Ottoman army \\"up the coastal plain.\\" However, the pursuit which eventually ended some north, began during the morning of 7 November when the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade advanced out of Gaza to reach Beit Hanun where they encountered part of the Gaza garrison defending a strong rearguard position on a ridge south-east of Beit Hanun. While they succeeded in occupying a ridge west of Beit Hanun the village remained in Ottoman hands, until retiring behind the Wadi Hesi, north north east of Gaza in the sand dunes and in the cultivated area. Yildirim Army Group had marched through the night, to gain distance and time to establish a light entrench line defending water sources. Here, they were attacked by the 157th Brigade (52nd Division) which had marched north from Gaza. However, the Ottoman forces succeeded in holding the Wadi all day, resisting the EEF advance strongly, until late on 8 November.Preston 1921 pp. 50‚Äì1Gullett 1919 p. 16Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp.130‚Äì4 The casualties suffered by the XX Corps between 31 October and 7 November were, 932 killed, 4,444 wounded and 108 missing. During this period they captured 2,177 prisoners, 45 guns, seven trench mortars and 50 machine guns.Paget 1994 Vol. 5 p. 168 = 8 November = By the morning of 8 November, Ali Fuad's force was found north of Tel el Sheria, operating independently of the Seventh and Eighth Armies.Grainger 2006 p. 154 Patrols by the Composite Regiment (Royal Glasgow Yeomanry, Duke of Lancaster Yeomanry 1/1st Hertfordshire Yeomanry squadrons) at Sheikh Abbas, found the redoubts along the Gaza to Beersheba road lightly held. Large sections of the Ottoman 26th and 54th Divisions had quietly retreated during the night of 7/8 November, while the EEF had been held up by the 53rd Division's machine gun screen. The Ottoman force withdrew through the narrowing gap between the EEF's mounted troops advancing on the coast and those inland.Grainger 2006 pp. 153‚Äì4Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 665 The rearguard trenches still held on the Gaza to Beersheba road, resulted in the XX Corps and XXI Corps transport making long detours, to avoid fire. The 232nd Brigade with the South African Brigade Field Artillery, 495th Field Company Royal Engineers and two sections of a field ambulance managed to advance to Deir Sneid during the day.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 138 Hodgson ordered the 3rd Light Horse and the 5th Mounted Brigades of the Australian Mounted Division to advance, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade's right on Kh. el Kofkha, and the 5th Mounted Brigade's left on Huj. Chauvel, aware of the advance by troops of the XXI Corps along the coast ordered Hodgson at 13:00 to send a regiment of the 4th Light Horse Brigade (which had returned to his command earlier in the day) to make touch them. The 12th Light Horse Regiment rode in one and a half hours, across country to join up with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade near Beit Hanun.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp.118‚Äì9 And, late in the afternoon the Australian Mounted Division reached Huj, where the Yeomanry charge captured 30 prisoners, 11 field guns and four machine guns.Powles 1922 p. 144  Huj  Ottoman Army howitzer captured near Huj now on display outside Victoria Barracks, Melbourne. The advance towards Huj by the Australian Mounted Division, with the 60th (London) Division, resumed on 8 November, when another strong rearguard of artillery and machine-guns was encountered.Woodward 2006 pp. 124, 127Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 117 While suffering \\"considerable shell fire,\\" the 5th Mounted Brigade advanced on the left of the 60th (London) Division. During a personal reconnaissance by Major General Shea commanding the 60th (London) Division, he saw a \\"straggling column of enemy moving from west to east some ahead and a flank guard with artillery hastily taking up a position to the right front.\\" He commanded the 5th Mounted Brigade to charge the Ottoman flank guard.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 120‚Äì1 A small contingent made a cavalry charge at Huj with sabres. These 200 men from the 1/1st Warwickshire Yeomanry and the 1/1st Worcestershire Yeomanry suffered heavy casualties but managed to reach the guns and cut down the gunners. In doing so they destroyed the last of the Ottoman strength south of Huj.Carver p. 218 However, no large groups of enemy soldiers were cut off. While the Australian Mounted Division captured Huj, which had been the site of the headquarters of Kress von Kressenstein's Eighth Army, the Anzac Mounted Division captured Wadi Jemmame and the water supply.Grainger 2006 pp. 135, 156 The 60th (London) Division reached the end of their lines of communication when they bivouacked about east of Huj. The division had marched between 05:30 on 6 November and 16:30 on 8 November, capturing the Kauwukah and Rushdi systems, and the bridgehead at Sheria; stopping a determined counterattack and pushing Ottoman rearguards from three defensive positions. They captured two 5.9 howitzers, 10 field guns, 21 machine guns, two Lewis guns and anti aircraft guns. The 179th Brigade suffered 28 killed, 274 wounded and two missing, the 180th Brigade suffered 50 killed, 249 wounded and six missing, and the 181st Brigade suffered 35 killed, 207 and 10 missing. The divisional artillery suffered 11 killed and 44 wounded.Dalbiac 1927 pp. 134‚Äì5  XX and XXI Corps transport problems  Transport wagons. Gaza in the background Only one infantry division could be supplied and maintained at a distance of from railhead, with the camels and wheeled transport allotted to the EEF infantry corps.Massey 1919 p. 13 During the attack on Beersheba the transport of the XXI Corps had been assigned to supply the XX Corps, which marched back to near railhead at Karm after the victory. Here minimal transport was needed so the transport was sent back to the XXI Corps. Many thousands of camels in long lines slowly converged on their allotted areas, before being loaded up for the advance. Motor lorries caked with dust, also drove westwards across the sand and powdered earth. The sleepless drivers' vehicles were then load up before driving off to supply their infantry units.Massey 1919 p. 45 The 60th (London) Division which could not be supplied north of Huj, remained in that area while the transport of the two infantry corps were being reorganised.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 124 and note  Desert Mounted Corps  So it was only units of the XXI Corps on the coast advancing to attack the Ottoman rearguard defending the Wadi Hesi line, and six mounted brigades of Desert Mounted Corps inland which were available to pursue the Ottoman army. Urgently needing reinforcements, Chauvel ordered the Yeomanry Mounted Division back to Desert Mounted Corps from Barrow's Detachment in the Tel el Khuweilfe area on 8 November. The Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade, Yeomanry Mounted Division) covered in 54 hours.Bruce 2002 p. 144Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 661, 664 Many of the frequent counterattacks directed towards Desert Mounted Corps, were against the right from the foothills of the Judean Hills held by the Seventh Ottoman Army. A major Ottoman rearguard south-west of Nejile determined to keep the EEF pursuit away from the water for 24 hours.The average number of times Desert Mounted Corps horses were watered during the advance was once every 36 hours. [Preston 1921 p. 316] The pressure of the Anzac Mounted Division with the 7th Mounted Brigade attached, (while the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was detached from its division) eventually forced the rearguard to give way. However, the 1/1st Sherwood Rangers and the 1/1st South Notts Hussars (7th Mounted Brigade) were vigorously counterattacked at Mudweiweh on the Anzac Mounted Division's right which they \\"gallantly held off.\\"Massey 1919 p.42 The Anzac Mounted Division (less the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) had ridden out at dawn towards Bureir, about north‚Äìeast of Gaza, with the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades in line covering a front of about centred about Abu Dilakh with the 7th Mounted Brigade in reserve on the right of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 118 The 1st Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) advanced at 05:45 towards Tell en Nejile, while the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) remained at Ameidat to guard the right flank. The 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade), on the left advanced towards Kh. Jemmame. The division rode across open, rolling, treeless, firm country dotted with prominent hills or 'tels' designed for cavalry with the Australian Mounted on their left. In the process, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured two guns, which had held them up the evening before. Horses queue for water at Jemmameh 8 November 1917. Ambulance horses and the end of the queue at 08:30 were watered at 17:30 From 09:00 long columns of retreating Yildirim Army Group units, with guns and transport, were seen moving northwards through Kh. el Kofkha towards Jemmame. After watering their horses at the Wadi Sheria, the 7th Mounted Brigade, arrived at divisional headquarters at 09:00 and was immediately ordered to reinforce the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades in the centre. At 11:00 the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was counter‚Äìattacked strongly on the right of the mounted infantry line, near Tel el Nejile, and was held up while the 7th Mounted Brigade, in the centre, continued to advance towards Bir el Jemameh. By about 13:00 they had nearly reached their objective, when they were heavily attacked by the Ottoman defenders covering the water supply, forcing the brigade back, and endangering its left flank. The 1st Light Horse Brigade came up on the western side of the 7th Mounted Brigade, and drove the Ottoman attackers back, the leading troops of 1st Light Horse Brigade, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment fought their way into Bir el Jemameh/Kh Jemmame shortly after 15:00. Here they captured the wells, cisterns and steam pumping plant intact, including the engineer in charge. While a regiment of the 1st Light Horse Brigade secured the high ground to the north overlooking Bir el Jemameh protecting the area, the remainder of the brigade and the 7th Mounted Brigade, watered all their horses.Preston 1921 pp. 51‚Äì2 Meanwhile, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade occupied Tel el Nejil station after dark, when the Ottoman 53rd Division's defenders had retired. Although some water was found here in the Wadi Hesi, it was not possible to water the horses of the outpost troops which established a night outpost line, protecting Nejil.Preston 1921 p. 52 The Anzac Mounted Division had captured the country from Nejile to the north bank of the wadi Jemmameh, along with 300 prisoners and two guns.Massey 1919 p. 43 While the Australian Mounted Division advanced round the north side of Huj, their 4th Light Horse Brigade in touch with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (XXI Corps) at Beit Hanun. During the day, their 3rd Light Horse Brigade captured prisoners and two Austrian 5.9 howitzers. By the evening of 8 November, all the Ottoman positions which had made up the Gaza‚ÄìBeersheba line had been captured and the enemy was in full retreat. During 8 November the EEF advanced to occupy a position due east of Huj, which had been the army headquarters and military railway terminus of the coast line. EEF artillery was then able to get into position just before dark, to fire during the night on the main road leading north from Huj. By the morning of 9 November, the road was littered with guns, limbers, ammunition wagons and transport of all descriptions, jumbled up into heaps with their teams shot.Powles 1922 pp. 143‚Äì4 Historians have characterised the pursuit as a failed attempt to capture the withdrawing Ottoman forces.Woodward 2006 p. 122Paget 1994 Vol. 5 pp. 258‚Äì9 That the XXI Corps advance from Gaza and the Desert Mounted Corps advance from Tel esh Sheria were to form \\"two jaws\\" to cut off and capture the retreating Ottoman armies.Grainger 2006 pp. 151‚Äì2 During this period, some horses only had one good drink in four days which had a serious effect on their condition. So only six of the 11 brigades of Desert Mounted Corps were available for the pursuit and having been short of water since leaving Khalasa/Asluj/Easni on 30/31 October their horses were far from fit. The unfit brigades were formed into a reserve corps and returned to areas where feed and water were available. When revived, they became available as reinforcements as the water situation north of Hareira and Sharia was sparsely populated with few very deep, low yielding water wells. Yildirim Army Group's tactics took the geographic conditions into account. They knew that if the EEF was delayed more than 48 hours without water it the pursuit would have to stop so strong rearguards were established to allow their infantry to withdraw well ahead of the slower British infantry. The EEF forces persevered in spite of the long marches on very limited forage and water, to attack the Ottoman forces relentlessly.Veterinary History pp. 204‚Äì5Powles 1922 pp. 133‚Äì4 = Manoeuvre warfare armaments = The vast transformation of warfare by the machine gun was demonstrated during 8 November, as it was not the Ottoman artillery which interfered with the Anzac Mounted Division's advance, but machine guns which prevented them from breaking through to attack and capture the columns. The 8 November also demonstrated the value of swords in mounted attack, directly during the attack at Huj and indirectly when the swordless Australian light horse were \\"compelled to make dismounted attacks\\" instead of attacking large retreating Ottoman columns. Before Allenby arrived, the British command had \\"contemplated withdrawing the swords from the Yeomanry regiments to lighten the burdens of their horses, on the ground that the arme blanche was little likely ever to be used.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 123 =Air attacks and support=  No. 304 Bavarian Flying Squadron  Yildirim Army Group suffered a serious loss of aircraft, stores and aerodromes during the retreat. In order to protect their air force, it was decided on 4 November during a conference with Felmy commander of the German Air Force, that one of the new German squadrons based at Irak el Menshiye aerodrome, should move north to a new aerodrome near Junction Station. This move was delayed for three days \\"owing to urgent need of pilots\\" but by 7 November, when the move was finally ordered, transport was not available. A staff officer of the Ottoman Eighth Army arrived at 18:00 in a car to order an immediate retreat. No. 304 Squadron requested railway wagons to transport the flying material, but the only ones available were full of corn. The military commissioner argued that the Army Group had ordered provisions be sent back as a priority but the Flying Squadron officer threatened to machine gun the railway station if the wagons were not handed over. The corn was emptied, and the flying squadrons loaded holding up the departure of the train.Cutlack 1941 pp. 82‚Äì4  EEF aerial support  Three RE8 fighter aircraft of No 1 Squadron AFC prepare to take off on a bombing raid during the Southern Palestine offensive in November 1917 Air raids by the EEF were carried out during the night of 1/2 November when twelve bombs were dropped on Gaza. On 3 and 4 November air raids were made over the hills north of Beersheba. By 6 November it was reported that Ottoman hospitals were seen being moved back indicating the beginnings of a general retreat towards Mejdel which was also bombed by aircraft.Cutlack 1941 pp. 79‚Äì80 Bombs were also dropped on the main positions behind the Kauwukah defences, near Um Ameidat, on Gaza and on shelters west of Sheria, and three aerial combats were fought against three hostile aircraft.Egyptian Expeditionary Force War Diary November 1917 AWM4-1-6-19part2 During this time German aircraft had rarely been seen, but that afternoon two R.E.8s and two B.E.12.a aircraft from No. 1 Squadron on photography patrol were attacked by four Albatros aircraft and badly damaged.Cutlack 1941 p. 80 While a German aircraft was shot down in flames near the Wadi Hesi.Gullett 1941 p. 448 'Iraq el Menshiye aerodrome and railway station after EEF air raid on 8 November 1917 Up until the Ottoman withdrawal became apparent on 7 November, the Royal Flying Corps had mainly been involved in strategical reconnaissance by the 40th (Army) Wing, while the 5th (Corps) Wing had been undertaking artillery registration and tactical photography. Now most aircraft began bomb and machine gun attacks on the retiring columns.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 138‚Äì9 During the pursuit No. 1 Australian Flying Squadron, carried out the photographic work, taking detailed photos of the country and the position of the enemy immediately ahead, and took part in air raids. For a full week, they attacked the Ottoman columns with machine guns and bombs, as well as Ottoman infrastructure including aerodromes, transport and artillery, hitting many of their targets.Massey 1919 p. 107 Concentrations of Ottoman forces were reported on 7 November at el Mejdel and Beit Duras, to the north of the Wadi Hesi.Grainger 2006 p. 155 While the morning reconnaissance on 8 November reported the enemy retreating from everywhere, but the Ottoman aerial squadrons appeared to have been delayed. On the aerodromes at Julis (just beyond Mejdel), at Arak el Menshiye, and at Et Tine, aircraft were on the ground and many hangars had not yet been dismantled. A bombing raid by 30 aircraft, including nine Australian aircraft, attack the largest aerodromes at Arak el Menshiye in the morning. This raid, together with a repeat in the afternoon, caused considerable damage as 200 bombs were dropped including 48 hits, ten of which hit aircraft on the ground. Several hangars were set on fire or damaged, while aircraft on the ground were also damaged. Aircraft which escaped from Arak el Menshiye and Julis were bombed twice on 9 November. And at Et Tine on 9 November at least nine aircraft were destroyed. When Desert Mounted Corps reached Arak el Menshiye and Et Tine, on 10 and 11 November they found eight destroyed aircraft and the aerodromes along with the Arak el Menshiye railway station in ruins. Other targets included railway stations and junctions, troops on the march, supply dumps, transport were all continually bombed and machine gunned. A further five hostile aircraft were destroyed at Ramleh aerodrome and another one at Ludd while the battlefield was covered with debris from aerial and ground bombardments. Hostile aircraft flew in formations of between two and four aircraft in an attempt to challenge the new superiority of the EEF aircraft but on almost every occasion were unsuccessful. EEF aircraft controlled the skies for a time, although a renewal of the air war occurred on about 24 November. =9 November= The only infantry unit capable of advancing on 9 November was the 52nd (Lowland) Division's 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Archibald Herbert Leggett. The 155th and 157th Brigades of the 52nd (Lowland) Division were regrouping on 9 November, after fierce fighting for Sausage Ridge on 8 November.Grainger 2006, p. 158Preston 1921, p. 60 Most of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's infantry divisions were at the end of their lines of communication and were not able to follow up the Ottoman withdrawal. XXI Corps's 54th (East Anglian) Division was forced to rest at Gaza and the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade at Beit Hanun. In the rear, Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode's XX Corps had transferred its transport to XXI Corps. XX Corps's 60th (2/2nd London) Division (Major General John Shea) was resting at Huj and its 10th (Irish) (Major General John Longley) and 74th (Yeomanry) (Major General Eric Girdwood) Divisions were at Karm. In the field were the 53rd (Welsh) Division (Major General S. F. Mott), corps cavalry, the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, deployed in the front line near Tel el Khuweilfe in the foothills of the Judean Hills north of Beersheba.Wavell 1968, pp. 150‚Äì1Bruce 2002, pp. 147‚Äì9New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade War Diary 8 and 9 November 1917 AWM4-35-1-31 Allenby ordered the Yeomanry Mounted Division back from Khuweilfe to Chauvel immediately, in the afternoon of 8 November but they did not arrive on the right flank of Desert Mounted Corps until two days later, on 10 November. The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade was also returned to Chauvel's command on 11 November when the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was ordered forward from Beersheba. They arrived 18 1/2 hours later.Hill 1978 pp. 132‚Äì3 Meanwhile, Chauvel was forced to send the Australian Mounted Division back to water on 9 November, so only the Anzac Mounted Division (less the New Zealanders) which had watered at Jemmameh was available to continue the pursuit. Had the Australian and New Zealand regiments been armed with the sword they may have had opportunities for decisive shock actions in addition to the yeomanry cavalry charges at Huj, El Mughar and Abu Shushe.Hill 1978 pp. 132‚Äì3 The Ottoman Eighth Army troops were retiring in some order as quickly as possible, protected against serious attack, and fairly well ahead of their pursuers, while the Seventh Army in good condition, had retired about without interference, and was preparing to launch a counter‚Äìattack. While the EEF issued orders for the pursuit to advance on 9 November towards the Nahr Suqreir, more than north of Gaza, the next possible line of defence.Grainger 2006 p. 157 Isdud By 9 November the Eighth Army had retreated while the Seventh Army \\"had lost hardly any ground.\\" Soon after daylight, Chaytor's Anzac Mounted Division set out to ride across the maritime plain towards the coast, having watered their horses the previous evening.Preston 1921, p. 59 By about 08:30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade entered Bureir and around an hour later the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was approaching Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein's Eighth Army headquarters at Hulayqat, where an Ottoman rearguard occupied a strong position. The brigade made a dismounted attack capturing 600 prisoners, large amounts of supplies, materiel and an abandoned German field hospital. At midday El Mejdel, north-east of Gaza, was occupied by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, when they captured 170 prisoners and found a good well with a steam pump, enabling the brigade to quickly water all horses. After passing the ancient town of Ashkelon the Anzac Mounted Division was notified by the Desert Mounted Corps that the XXI Corps was marching up the coast towards El Mejdel and Julis. As the main Ottoman road and railway leading north from Gaza were both cut Chauvel ordered the division to advance towards Bayt Daras, requiring the division to turn north-east. Subsequently the 1st Light Horse Brigade entered Isdud close to the Mediterranean Sea while, on their right, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured the villages of Suafir el Sharkiye and Arak Suweidan, a convoy and its escort (some 350 prisoners). As the brigade was reorganising to secure the prisoners, Ottoman guns further north opened fire, shelling both captors and captives alike. Just before dark the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured a further 200 prisoners, before the Anzac Mounted Division took up a night battle outpost line, along high ground south of the Wadi Mejma, from near Isdud to Arak Suweidan.Powles 1922 p. 144Preston pp. 59‚Äì60 Meanwhile Hodgson's Australian Mounted Division, spent most of 9 November searching for water, which was eventually found at Huj. By the evening of 8 November, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had not watered since 7 November and the 5th Mounted Brigade since the evening of 6 November, and that if these two brigades were not watered the following day, the divisional war diary reported, \\"results will be most serious.\\" After relieving these two brigades at 07:30 on 9 November, the 4th Light Horse brigade sent out patrols searching for water. The 12th Light Horse Regiment found one small well at Nejed, while another patrol found two wells at Simsim with basic lifting appliances which made watering very slow. They also found touch with the Anzac Mounted Division. By noon on 9 November the division was watering at Jemmameh, which was not expected to be completed until 18:00.Australian Mounted Division General Staff War Diary November 1917 AWM4-1-58-5 After most of the horses had been watered, they advanced to the Kastina‚ÄìIsdud line capturing prisoners, guns, and transports on the way. This march made during the night of 9/10 November was the only night march made during the Sinai and Palestine campaign, through Ottoman territory.Wavell 1968, pp. 150‚Äì1Keogh 1955, p. 168 The Australian Mounted Division's 12th Light Horse Regiment (4th Light Horse Brigade) advanced north from Burieh to Al-Faluja arriving at 24:00 on 9/10 November when engineering stores and five burnt out aircraft were captured.Preston 1921, p. 66 The division was followed by the 4th Light Horse Brigade Field Ambulance and the divisional train made up of brigade transport and supply sections carrying rations. The field ambulance set up a dressing station and treated about 40 wounded men before moving through Huj at 16:00. After encountering rugged mountainous ravines and of very rough terrain, at around midnight they set up camp in a wadi bed.Hamilton 1996, p. 80 Barrow's Yeomanry Mounted Division, had been fighting in the Tel el Khuweilfe region until Allenby ordered it to rejoin the Desert Mounted Corps, away on the coast. Meanwhile, infantry in the 10th (Irish) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions remained at Karm, while the 60th (London) Division remained at Huj.Grainger 2006, p. 157Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 663 =10 November= Wadi Sukereir Falls' Sketch Map 9 shows position of the advance at 1800 on 10 November 1917 Ottoman forces were encountered on 10 November near Isdud on the Mediterranean Sea.

The 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade pushing across the Nahr Sukereir at Jisr Esdud, to Hamama. Here they successfully established a bridgehead on the Ottoman right flank. Ample water was found and the bridgehead was enlarged the following day.Grainger 2006, pp. 160 & 163 They followed the 1st Light Horse Brigade which had reported \\"All Clear\\" at Isdud at 08:30.1st Light Horse Brigade War Diary November 1917 AWM4-10-1-40 Although the Anzac Mounted Division reported on the morning of 10 November that the division was \\"ridden out\\" and had to halt for water,Falls p. 143 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had found water the previous afternoon at el Medjel and so was able to advance to occupy Isdud. However, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was unable to advance on 10 November because of strong Ottoman rearguards near \\"New Beit Duras\\" and Kustine. They spent the day searching for water and watering the brigade, before moving to Hamama at night, to complete watering of the horses.2nd Light Horse Brigade War Diary November 1917 AWM4-10-2-35 Summeil The 4th Light Horse Brigade was ordered at 10:40 on 10 November to threaten the Ottoman force opposing 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the Menshiye‚ÄìAl Faluja line.Preston 1921, p. 66 Between 08:00 and 10:30, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had occupied the Arak el Menshiye Station while the 4th Light Horse Brigade entered Al-Faluja to the north-west.Falls 1930 p. 144 The Australian Mounted Division was joined a few hours later by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which had left Huj early in the morning. They came up on the right of the Australian Mounted Division and took over Arak el Menshiye extending the line a little further east. By the afternoon of 10 November the whole of the Desert Mounted Corps with the exception of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, (still at Tel el Khuweilfe) were in line from a point a little east of Arak el Menshiye to the sea.Bruce 2002, pp. 148‚Äì9Preston 1921, pp. 58‚Äì9Desert Mounted Corps was less the Anzac Mounted Division. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 143] Both the Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions reconnoitred the eastern half of the Ottoman line running from Qastina, roughly through Balin and Barqusya, to the neighbourhood of Bayt Jibrin in the Judean Hills.Preston 1921, p. 66 Chauvel ordered the Yeomanry Mounted Division to move westward to the coast to support the Anzac Mounted Division, leaving the Australian Mounted Division on the right flank. Neither he nor Hodgson commanding the Australian Mounted Division were aware at that time, that the division was threatened by three or four Ottoman Eighth Army infantry divisions. The 16th and 26th Divisions (XX Corps) and the 53rd Division (XXII Corps) were holding a line between the railway line and Bayt Jibrin, all more or less reorganised and all within striking distance.Falls 1930, pp. 146‚Äì7 Ottoman trenches had been dug from Summil north of Arak el Menshiye to Zeita, to the north-east, and to the east of the railway line.Grainger 2006, p. 160 With its headquarters at Al-Faluja on 10 and 11 November, the Australian Mounted Division became engaged (during 10 November) in stubborn fighting, when the three brigades of the Australian Mounted Division ran into this Ottoman rearguard's left flank near the village of Summil.Gullett 1939, p. 460 At 12:55, Ottoman forces were seen advancing from Summil, and the 4th Light Horse Brigade deployed to attack them, with the 3rd Light Horse and the 5th Mounted Brigade in support. By 16:30 3rd Light Horse Brigade headquarters were established south-east of Al-Faluja on the railway line, but owing to darkness at 17:15 the attack was not developed and night battle outpost lines were established at 20:00. The 4th Light Horse Brigade held a line linking to the Anzac Mounted Division at Beit Affen, while the Ottomans rearguard were holding a ridge near Barqusya with three cavalry troops, three guns and about 1,500 infantry. =11 November= The mounted infantry and cavalry brigades of the Australian Mounted Division were unable to advance further on 10 November, due to intense Ottoman artillery fire which continued throughout the day. However, Summil was occupied unopposed, at 06:00 by patrols of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on 11 November when the place was found to be deserted. However by 09:30 Ottoman units were holding a high ridge north east of the town and Ottoman field guns began shelling Summeil from about away. In the afternoon the brigade carried out active patrolling making themselves as conspicuous as possible without becoming engaged, while the division advanced north.4th Light Horse Brigade War Diary AWM4, 10/4/113rd Light Horse Brigade War Diary AWM4, 10/3/34 Allenby's force was deployed with infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 75th Division in the centre, the Australian Mounted Division on their right flank with the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions on the infantry's left flank.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 158Bruce 2002, p. 150 He ordered the 52nd (Lowland) Division to extend their position across the Nahr Sukereir on the Ottoman right flank. And, reinforced with two additional brigades, he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined and substantial Ottoman counterattack.Powles 1922, p. 145Preston 1921, pp. 72‚Äì3 The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was ordered to rejoin the Anzac Mounted Division on 11 November.

Prisoners had been captured from almost every unit of the Ottoman Army, indicating that rearguards had been driven back in on the main body of the Eighth Ottoman army. However, all along their line Ottoman resistance grew noticeably stronger.Preston 1922, p. 70Wavell 1968, p. 153Bruce 2002, p. 149 Erich von Falkenhayn, commander of the Yildirim Army Group, had decided to make a stand in front of Junction Station, deploying his forces by the evening of 11 November and he ordered a counterattack against the British right flank which was covered by the Australian Mounted Division. His plan was to overwhelm them, cut their supply lines, outflank and capture all the forward units. Originally ordered for 11 November it was postponed until the next day.Keogh 1955, p. 170 =12 November= Infantry attack As part of the preparations for the attack on Junction Station, planned for the next day, the 52nd (Lowland) Division made a preparatory attack near the coast. They were to attack north of the Nahr Sukhereir between the villages of Burqa and Yazur with the Yeomanry Mounted Division acting as flank guard.Falls 1930, pp. 148‚Äì9Carver 2003 p. 219Grainger 2006 p. 165 Their objective was an important Ottoman rearguard position which ran from the village of Burqa to Brown Hill. While the village was easily taken the steep sided Brown Hill proved an extremely difficult attack. The hill was topped by a large cairn and commanded a long field of fire over the plain southwards across the Nahr Sukhereir.Grainger 2006 p. 163 By the time a battalion of the 156th Brigade, covered by two batteries of the 264th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and the South African Field Artillery Brigade of 75th Division captured the crest, the battalion had been reduced to one officer and about 100 men. However, just 20 minutes after their victory, the remnants of the Scots battalion was unable to withstand an Ottoman counterattack and was driven off after a fierce struggle at close quarters.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 152‚Äì4 The 2/3rd Gurkha Rifles were then ordered to renew the attack at dusk. Owing to poor light, the artillery was no longer able to give much assistance, but the Gurkhas quickly retook the hill with a bayonet charge, suffering 50 casualties, and in the process recovering two Lewis guns.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 154 The fighting here has been described as equal in intensity to the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade's assault at Sausage Ridge on 8 November.Grainger 2006 p. 160 The success of these operations north of the Nahr Sukhereir opened the way on the Mediterranean coast for the main attacks the following day, on the Ottoman armies' front line positions. Ottoman counterattack alt=Map shows the positions of the Australian Mounted Division on 12 November and Ottoman divisions' attacks. While the infantry attack was in progress, the Australian Mounted Division advanced in the direction of Tel es Safi, to press the left flank of the Ottoman forces as strongly as possible.Wavell 1968 p. 151 About 4,000 Australian and British mounted troops of 3rd and 4th Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades moved northwards in a conspicuous demonstration of aggression. The Ottoman force appeared at first, to have retired altogether, and the 9th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) was able to ride through Barqusya, with one troop pressing on to occupy Tel es Safi. The 5th Mounted Brigade also found Balin unoccupied, and rapidly advanced northwards towards Tel es Safi and Kustineh. By 12:00 the Australian Mounted Division was spread over at least facing the north and east, when four divisions of the Ottoman Seventh Army (about 5,000 soldiers) began their counterattack.Grainger 2006 pp. 162‚Äì4 Ten minutes later the British Honourable Artillery Company horse artillery battery opened fire, but was hopelessly out shot, outnumbered, and out ranged by Ottoman guns of greater power and weight.Grainger 2006 p. 164 alt=An artillery battery of four guns deployed in the hills The Ottoman infantry divisions were moving south from El Tineh east of Qastina from the Ottoman controlled branch line of the railway line. Here and further north along the railway, trains were arriving with huge numbers of Ottoman soldiers, deployed for the attack in three separate columns (of all arms). They were seen advancing towards Tel es Safi from the north and north-east. Not long afterwards, the 11th Light Horse Regiment (4th Light Horse Brigade) was forced to retire from Qastina, as Ottoman units occupied the place in strength.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 149 The approach of the Eighth Ottoman Army's XX Corps (16th, 26th, 53rd, and 54th Divisions) was at first unknown to the 5th Mounted Brigade in Balin. But at about 13:00 they were attacked by about 5,000 Ottoman soldiers in two columns, one coming down the track from Junction Station to Tel el Safi, and the other arrived by train and marched south from El Tineh Station. The 5th Mounted Brigade, was pushed back out of Balin before they could be reinforced by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade which rode from Summil, followed by two batteries of the Australian Mounted Division. One light horse regiment which managed to occupy Berkusie, was forced to retire by a very strong Ottoman force supported by heavy artillery fire from several batteries. All available troops of the Australian Mounted Division were now engaged, but the Ottoman attack continued to be strongly pressed.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 148‚Äì150Grainger 2006 pp. 163‚Äì4 The 4th Light Horse Brigade had been unable to support the 3rd Light Horse or the 5th Mounted Brigades, as they were being heavily attacked on the left of the 5th Mounted Brigade, while holding the line to the west towards Dayr Sunayd railway line. Ottoman units managed to advance to within of the 4th Light Horse Brigade's position, but were eventually stopped at the end of the day by machine-gun and rifle fire.Falls 1930 pp. 151‚Äì2Preston 1921 pp. 73‚Äì4 Hodgson (commander of the Australian Mounted Division) had ordered a slow withdrawal by 3rd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades to high ground on the line Bir Summil ‚Äì Khurbet Jeladiyeh. The order had only just been given when another Ottoman train was seen moving south. It stopped west of Balin and a fresh force of Ottoman soldiers rapidly deployed to attack the left flank of the 5th Mounted Brigade. Fighting steadily and withdrawing skilfully, the 3rd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades reached the edge of Summil village, where the Ottoman attack was finally held. Two batteries of Australian Mounted Division had come into action on the high ground north-west of Summeil firing on the fresh Ottoman force moving over the open plain in full view of the gunners. Effective EEF artillery fire halted this attacking Ottoman advance, forcing them to fall back a little where they dug trenches. The attack ended at 18:00 in darkness.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 150‚Äì2 Chauvel's reliance on the steadiness of the Australian Mounted Division was \\"amply justified.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 147 The Yildirim Army Group commander had been forced to halt his Seventh Army's attack, and then to take away from it the 16th Division, plus one regiment.Grainger 2006 pp. 164‚Äì5 While in their eastern sector, the 3rd Cavalry Division (Seventh Army's III Corps) and 19th Division (Eighth Army) held a line in front of Beit Jibrin.Wavell 1968 p. 114 This force waited throughout the day, prepared to begin a flank attack, but the opportunity never eventuated.Keogh 1955 pp. 170‚Äì1 =13 November= Mughar Ridge alt=Detail of Falls Map 9 shows EEF attacks from 12 to 14 November and infantry attack on 13 November A 20,000-strong Ottoman force was deployed to defend the Jaffa to Jerusalem railway along the Wadi al-Sarar and Al-Nabi Rubin. They held the prominent high ridge, which stretched north towards Zernukah and El Kubeibeh dominated the battlefield, which consisted of mainly bare and open cultivated land. This naturally strong ridge formed the backbone of the Ottoman Army's long defensive position defended by the Eighth Army's 3rd Division (XXII Corps) to the north, the 7th Division (Eighth Army Reserve) to the east, the 54th Division (XX Corps) near el Mesmiye, with the 53rd Division linking to the 26th Division (XX Corps) holding Tel es Safi.Grainger 2006 pp. 165‚Äì6Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Map 9 On the ridge, the villages of Qatra and Al-Maghar had been fortified to become two strong defensive positions, each with commanding views of the countryside. These villages were separated by the Wadi Jamus, which links the Wadi al-Sarar with the Nahr Rubin.Keogh 1955 p. 171 alt=Photo of mounted rifles brigade crossing a three arched stone bridge. Allenby's plan for 13 November was to turn the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast, despite aircraft and cavalry reconnaissances revealing the large Ottoman force, inland on his right flank facing the Australian Mounted Division. Indeed the division was ordered to make as big a demonstration of their activities, as possible, to focus Ottoman attention away from the coastal sector. Here Allenby planned for the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions to advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank, assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre.Wavell 1968 p. 151Preston 1921 p. 76 In the centre, the XXI Corps' 52nd (Lowland) and the 75th Divisions were to advance towards Junction Station between the Gaza road on the right, and the village of El Mughar on the left. These infantry attacks were held up by very strong Ottoman defences.Bruce2002 p. 150Wavell 1968 pp. 153‚Äì4 At Mesmiye the Ottoman Army was strongly deployed on high ground in and near the village, and well-sited machine-guns swept all approaches. However, infantry in the 75th Division made steady slow progress, eventually forcing the main body of the Ottoman rear guard, to fall back to a slight ridge to the north-east. Towards dusk the final stage of the infantry assault was supported by two troops of 11th Light Horse Regiment (4th Light Horse Brigade), who galloped into action on the infantry's right flank and gave valuable fire support. An infantry frontal attack covered by machine-gun fire drove the Ottoman defenders off the ridge, enabling Mesmiye esh Sherqiye to be occupied soon after. Subsequently they halted in darkness not far from Junction Station.Wavell 1968 p. 155Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 160‚Äì2Keogh 1955 pp. 171‚Äì2 alt=Detail of Falls Map 9 shows the EEF approaching Junction Station On their right flank the Australian Mounted Division's 3rd and 4th Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades, reinforced by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade (Anzac Mounted Division), the 7th Mounted Brigade (Yeomanry Mounted Division) and two cars of the 12th Light Armoured Motor Battery, attacked in line advancing northwards towards Junction Station.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 175Although Falls Map 9 shows the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the left of the 155th Brigade near Yebna on 13 November and south of Summil on 12 November, this light horse brigade's War Diary confirms the brigade remained with its division, on the right of the main attack.

As soon as Junction Station was captured they were to swing north to occupy Ramla and Lod and reconnoitre towards Jaffa. After capturing Yibna, the 8th Mounted Brigade (Yeomanry Mounted Division) continued their advance northwards, to El Kubeibeh and Zernukah.Paget 1994 pp. 191‚Äì2 However, the 22nd Mounted Brigade was held up by Ottoman units defending Aqir, while the 6th Mounted Brigade (with the Imperial Camel Brigade covering their northern flank) was directed to attack el Mughar.Wavell 1968 pp. 154‚Äì5Grainger 2006 pp. 167 & 170 The 52nd (Lowland) Division had been halted at about 11:30 by heavy shrapnel and machine-gun fire forcing them to the shelter of the Wadi Jamus about from their objective. Every attempt to leave the wadi was stopped by very heavy fire from well placed Ottoman machine-guns.Keogh 1955 p. 172 At about 14:30 it was agreed between the GOC 52nd (Lowland) Division and the GOC Yeomanry Mounted Division that the 6th Mounted Brigade should attack the El Mughar ridge in combination with a renewed infantry assault on Qatra and El Mughar. Half an hour later two mounted regiments, the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade), already deployed in the Wadi Jamus, advanced in column of squadrons extended to four paces across , at first trotting then galloping up and onto the crest of the ridge.Wavell 1968 pp. 153‚Äì4 The horses were completely exhausted and could not continue the pursuit of the escaping Ottoman units down the far side.Blenkinsop 1925, p. 205 However, the Ottoman defenders continued to hold El Mughar village until two squadrons of the Berkshire Yeomanry regiment (6th Mounted Brigade) fighting dismounted, with two battalions of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, renewed the attack.Grainger 2006 p. 168 Fighting in the village continued until 17:00 when both of the crucial fortified villages of Qatra and El Mughar were captured.Wavell 1968 pp. 153‚Äì5 = 14 November = Units of the 75th Division supported by several armoured cars occupied Junction Station during the morning of 14 November, cutting the Ottoman Jaffa to Jerusalem railway.Bruce 2002 p. 151Falls 1930 p. 164 While the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions concentrated and reorganised their ranks during the day,Keogh 1955 p. 175 the 4th Light Horse Brigade entered El Tineh early in the morning, with the remainder of the Australian Mounted Division following a couple of hours later.

They pushed on towards the Wadi Hunayn where Ottoman rearguards were encountered in the orange groves and on the hills between El Kubeibeh and the sand dunes.Powles 1922 pp. 145‚Äì6 About noon the 1st Light Horse Brigade drove an Ottoman rearguard from a ridge facing Yibna and occupied the village of Rehovot also known as Deiran.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 176Powles 1922 pp. 153‚Äì4 At the same time the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (commanded by Brigadier General William Meldrum) ran into a determined and well entrenched Ottoman rearguard near Ayun Kara, which they attacked. Fierce close quarter fighting against the Ottoman 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon.Grainger 2006 pp. 172‚Äì3 Although severely threatened, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and they occupied Jaffa two days later, unopposed.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 177‚Äì8 The official New Zealand historian concluded in 1922 that the engagement at Ayun Kara demonstrated the ability of the New Zealand mounted rifles regiments to rapidly attack and reinforce successive positions on horseback. During this intense engagement, the attacking power of the mounted rifle arm, against a strongly entrenched infantry position was comprehensively proven.Powles 1922 p. 150 =15 November 1917= Abu Shusheh, Ludd and Ramleh alt=In the distance a group of people walk down a dirt road away from the village. At midnight on 14 November von Falkenhayn ordered a general withdrawal and the Ottoman Seventh Army, which retreated back into the Judean Hills towards Jerusalem, while the Eighth Army was ordered to retreat to the north of Jaffa across the Nahr el Auja about north of Jaffa.Keogh 1955 pp. 175 & 178Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 217 These Ottoman armies had suffered heavily, and lost between of Ottoman territory north of the old Gaza‚ÄìBeersheba line.

An Ottoman rearguard above Abu Shusheh blocked the Vale of Ajalon on the right flank of the advance towards Ramleh. The Yeomanry Mounted Division reached the Jerusalem road, after the 6th Mounted Brigade made a cavalry charge, which overwhelmed an Ottoman rearguard position. This charge has been described as even more difficult than that at Mughar Ridge, owing to the rocky nature of the ground over which the horsemen rode.Bruce 2002 pp. 151‚Äì2Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 178 =16 November= The pursuit continued as the EEF pushed north, Jaffa was captured by the Anzac Mounted Division in mid‚ÄìNovember, and Jerusalem was captured by the XX Corps on 9 December.

He decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills, and another separate force to operate on the maritime plain, could be maintained at an extended distance from base.Keogh 1955 p. 177Wavell 1968, p. 157Bruce 2002 pp. 152, 155Moore 1920 p. 95 On 18 November, while Allenby was at the XXI Corps headquarters at El Kastine, the decision was made to closely follow the Ottoman Seventh Army into the Judean Hills.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp.188‚Äì9 This decision, to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Seventh Army in the Judean Hills, was to keep the pressure on this Ottoman army with the hope of capturing Jerusalem, while denying them time to complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack. Two infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) (Major General J. Hill) and the 75th Division,(Major General P. C. Palin), and two mounted divisions; the Yeomanry and the Australian Mounted Divisions, were to begin the advance into the Judean Hills.Carver 2003, p. 222 The Ottoman forces they encountered on the road into the hills, were rearguards von Falkenhayn had ordered the XX Corps to establish, as it retired back to defend Jerusalem. Established on commanding ridges, these rearguards were made up of small groups dug in on the hills, each of which were attacked one after the other by Indian and Gurkha troops who outmanoeuvred the Ottoman defenders.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 190‚Äì1 \\"[A]ll the armies that have sought to take Jerusalem have passed this way, save only that of Joshua.

These two divisions of the XXI Corps commanded by Bulfin had been involved in the extremely successful, but almost continuous fighting advance from 7 November. Their part in this first campaign of manoeuvre has them \\"advance[ing] in stages and then faltered in the hills around Jerusalem ...

Two bridgeheads were established by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. The first was across the bridge on the main road near Khurbet Hadrah, while the second was established on the coast Sheik Muanis, near the mouth of the river. Their aims were to discourage the Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army, and to gain territory. The New Zealand Mounted Brigade, and two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, continued to hold these two bridgeheads on the northern bank, until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November.Bruce 2002, pp. 158‚Äì9 The 3rd and 7th Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army pushed back the bridgeheads and restored their hold on the Nahr el Auja, and the tactical situation. Relief of XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps 24 November to 2 December On 24 November also, Allenby ordered the relief of the XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps by the XX Corps. This relief of the XXI Corps has been described as, \\"[t]his unnecessary shifting of troops [which] was a time‚Äìconsuming procedure that delayed Jerusalem's fall ... [due] to the timid nature of the British advance.\\" Owing to supply problems during the advance from Beersheba, Allenby had left Philip W. Chetwode's XX Corps in the rear close to the lines of communication where they could be easily supplied and refitted. After 10 days rest, these fresh troops were ordered to the front in the Judean Hills to take over the offensive against the Ottoman Seventh Army.Keogh 1955 p. 182 On 23 November, the 60th (London) Division, commanded by Major General John Shea, arrived at Latron from Huj and relieved the seriously depleted 52nd (Lowland) and the 75th Divisions, without much of a reduction in fighting ability on 28 November. On the same day, the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, commanded by Major General E. S. Girdwood, arrived at Latron from Karm, and two days later the 10th (Irish) Division, commanded by Major General J. R. Longley, also arrived at Latron from Karm. The movement of such large formations made a pause in the fighting unavoidable, and so the attack was discontinued, but von Falkenhayn and his Ottoman Army took notice of the temporary cessation of hostilities.Bruce 2002, p. 158Falls 1930, p.218 Ottoman counterattacks 27 November to 1 December Ottoman counterattacks 18:00 hours 28 November 1917 Von Falkenhayn and the Ottoman Army sought to benefit from the weakened and depleted state of the worn out British Empire divisions which had been fighting and advancing since the beginning of the month.Bruce 2002, p. 159 During the week beginning 27 November the Ottoman Army launched a series of infantry attacks employing shock tactics in the hope of breaking the British lines during the period of destabilisation created by EEF reinforcements and withdrawals. Counterattacks were launched by the Ottoman 16th and 19th Divisions in the Judean Hills on Nebi Samweil and on the Zeitun plateau. Attacks were also launched against British lines of communication via a gap between the British forces on the maritime plain and those in the Judean Hills and also against several British units spread out on the maritime plain.Grainger 2006, pp. 195‚Äì6 & 199 Turkish attack the 4th Northamptonshire Regiment at Wilhelma on 27 November 1917 The Ottoman forces on the maritime plain advanced in strength in the region of Wilhelma (a German colony) to attack the 162nd Brigade (54th Division). Here a strong attack was launched against the EEF units holding Wilhelma Station. The attackers also established a strong firing line in the Wadi Rantye. By 17:00 these coordinated attacks had progressed to within of the British infantry line, where they were held while both flanks of the Ottoman force were attacked and driven in, forcing the attackers back to Rantye.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 221‚Äì2 On the left the 54th (East Anglian) Division a company of the 4th Battalion (Imperial Camel Brigade) was attacked at Bald Hill, south of Mulebbis and pushed back off the hill, which was later targeted by EEF artillery.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 223 Also on 27 November, the Yeomanry Mounted Division's advanced post at Zeitun on the western end of the Beitunia Ridge was attacked by a larger Ottoman force. They managed to hold off the attackers until 28 November, when the division was forced to withdraw from Sheik Abu ez Zeitun and Beit Ur el Foqa as well as Zeitun.Wavell 1968 p. 163 On 28 November, the Australian Mounted Division (less the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade) which had been resting at Mejdel from 19 to 27 November, was ordered to return to the Judean Hills. The 4th Light Horse Brigade's march to Berfilya was diverted straight on to Beit Ur el Tahta.Falls 1930, pp. 223‚Äì4 When they reached south of Beit Ur el Tahta, the brigade covered a dangerous, isolated position, out of contact with either the 8th or the 6th Mounted Brigades. By nightfall, the line, was held by the 60th (London) Division, the 8th Mounted , the 22nd Mounted, the 7th Mounted, the 156th Brigade, the 155th Brigade, the 4th Light Horse Brigade still out of touch with the 8th and 6th Mounted Brigades.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 227 This line was \\"hard pressed\\" after night fall when the Ottoman attackers launched a \\"very fierce bombing attack\\" reopening a gap in the EEF line.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 228 These operations were supported on 28 November by a combined force of the British and Australian Nos. 1 and 111 Squadrons, which attacked the Tul Keram aerodrome with aerial bombing. This attack was repeated the following morning and evening after German planes bombed the Julis aerodrome and hit No. 113 Squadron's orderly room.Cutlack 1941, pp. 86‚Äì7 Detail of Ottoman counterattack on morning of 28 November 1917 As the Ottoman counterattacks continued on 29 November, the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade was ordered to rejoin its division, while the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) remained under orders of the 60th (London) Division. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade marched on to Berfilya west of el Burj.Falls 1930, p. 229A quarter of the men of these light horse brigades took the horses to the rear. Each man had four horses to look after day and night and as these \\"led horses\\" were prime targets for aerial bombing, it was both solid and dangerous work.[Hamilton 1996, p. 91] The Yeomanry Mounted Division was relieved by the 74th (Yeomanry) Division; two brigades of infantry were substituted for four brigades of cavalry resulting in a sixfold increase in the number of rifles. With additional reinforcements from the dismounted Australian Mounted Division, these proved sufficient troops to hold all subsequent Ottoman counterattacks.Preston 1921, p. 115 At about 01:00 on 1 December a battalion of the Ottoman 19th Division, armed with hand grenades, launched a series of attacks at Beit Ur el Tahta against the 157th Brigade, and north east of El Burj against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.Preston 1921, p. 117 After two attempts at Beit Ur el Tahta, they succeeded in driving a severely weakened infantry company of the 5th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, 52nd (Lowland) Division, off of the ridge in front of the village, but by 04:30 they had reoccupied the position. The 8th Light Horse Regiment north east of El Burj withstood four separate onslaughts by enemy forces armed with stick grenades. A squadron of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars of the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade, attached to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was rushed up to fill gaps in the line, and the Hong Kong Battery came into action. They were reinforced by the 4th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers with a small group of bombers from Beit Sira, which arrived just as Ottoman soldiers launched a new assault. The British bombing party attacked Ottoman bombers and after a fierce engagement forced them back. The Ottomans continued desperately to attack and another company of the 4th Scots Fusiliers came up. Combined with the steady fire of the dismounted 3rd Light Horse Brigade, the shower of bombs from the Fusiliers forced the Ottoman soldiers to fall back and dig in. At dawn they surrendered.Falls 1930, pp.234‚Äì5One Scotsman furiously roared as he hurled one Mills grenade after another: \\"They mairched us a hunnder miles! (Tak' that, ya ...!)

And both side began to adjust and improve their lines, leaving insecure or hard to defend places. The fresh EEF soldiers increased the strength of their line, creating a powerful concentration. Over four days the 10th (Irish) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions extended their positions, while the extended position held by the 60th (London) Division was decreased.Wavell 1968 p. 162 Although it is claimed that on 3 December the Ottoman Army had abandoned their counterattacks and that fighting in the Judean Hills ceased,Wavell 1968 pp. 163‚Äì4 as a consequence of units of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division recapturing Beit Ur el Foqa, during a night time attack,Falls 1930, p. 235 the position was impossible to hold. At daylight they found they were overlooked by Ottoman positions on higher ground. Bombing and hand-to-hand fighting continued all morning, and the Yeomanry infantry battalion was forced to withdraw, suffering 300 casualties. =Mott's Detachment= The 53rd (Welsh) Division (XX Corps), with the Corps Cavalry Regiment and a heavy battery attached, remained on the Hebron road north of Beersheba, after that place was captured on 31 October and during the advance up the maritime plain. Now they came under direct orders from General Headquarters (GHQ) and became known as Mott's Detachment. The detachment was ordered to advance north along the Beersheba to Jerusalem road and by 4 December had arrived south of Hebron. Here two Australian light armoured cars from a Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB), drove in from the north. They reported no Ottoman units in Hebron, so the detachment continued their advance to the Dilbe valley that night.Falls 1930, p. 239Grainger 2006, p. 205A Light Car Patrol raided Beit Jibrin and Beit Netief, and the Wadi es Sunt. Unable to retire, they drove on towards Solomon's Pools and south to Hebron and on towards Beersheba.

At the crucial moment, Mott's Detachment had been unable to cover the southern flank of the 60th (London) Division, forcing the Londoners to pause during daylight, as enfilading fire would have made their advance extremely costly.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 246, 250‚Äì1 =Surrender= The surrender of Jerusalem to the British, 9 December 1917 During almost continuous rain on 8 December, Jerusalem ceased to be protected by the Ottoman Empire.Hill 1978, p. 136Powles 1922, p. 167 At the same time Chetwode launched the final advance taking the heights to the west of the city. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated during the evening and the city surrendered the following day.Bruce 2002, p. 162 Jerusalem was almost encircled by the EEF, although Ottoman Army units briefly held the Mount of Olives on 9 December. They were attacked by units of the 60th (London) Division which captured the position the following afternoon.Bruce 2002, p. 163  Casualties  From 31 October to the capture of Jerusalem the Ottoman armies suffered 25,000 casualties.Falls p. 262 A total of 14,393 battle casualties were evacuated to Egypt from the EEF along with 739 Australians during October and November 1917. These Australian wounded were mainly treated in the 1,040 beds of No. 14 Australian General Hospital at the Abbassia Barracks, Cairo. Here 754 surgical cases, the heaviest battle casualties admissions of the Sinai and Palestine campaign, were admitted during November. These had been evacuated by ambulance trains from the British casualty clearing stations at Deir el Belah and Imara. During the same period it received 720 medical cases, which rapidly increased during the following months.Downes p. 753 Aftermath =Capture of Arsuf 20‚Äì21 December= Falls' Sketch Map 20 Passage of the Nahr el Auja Allenby planned to establish a defensive line running from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea. With both flanks secured, the line could be held with reasonable security.Allenby to Robertson 7 December 1917 in Hughes 2004 pp. 102‚Äì3 In order to establish this line, it was necessary to push the 3rd and 7th Infantry Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army back away from the Nahr el Auja north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast. After the first attempt between 24 to 25 November, this second attempt in the same area was officially designated a subsidiary battle during the Jerusalem Operations. One historian thought these operations \\"hardly merit in size or importance the name 'Battle of Jaffa'.\\" Now, three infantry divisions of the XXI Corps began moving their units into position on the coastal plain on 7 December. The 75th Division was on the right with the 54th (East Anglian) Division in the centre and the 52nd (Lowland) Division on the coast.Bruce 2002, p. 166Wavell 1968, p. 169 They relieved the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, which had been heavily involved in the first attempt to capture the Nahr el Auja, fought shortly after their victory at the Battle of Ayun Kara.Powles 1922, p. 170 Military operations resumed a fortnight after the surrender of Jerusalem with the final EEF attack of this campaign.Wavell 1968, p. 162 Preparations were, however, complicated by the sodden state of the low and swampy ground on the southern banks of the Nahr el Auja where the attack would be launched, and the river was swollen by rain which had fallen on 19 and 20 December. From Mulebbis to the sea the river was between wide and deep except for the ford at the mouth known as Sheik Muanis. To the north of the river two prominent spurs ran down to the river from a series of sandy ridges. These overlooked the damaged stone bridge at Khurbet Hadrah to the east and the village of Sheik Muannis, near Jerisheh to the west where a mill dam bridged the stream.Bruce 2002, p. 167Wavell 1968, pp. 168, 170 The Ottoman Eighth Army held strong commanding positions covering all the possible crossing places which had been used by the attackers in November. They held both spurs in addition to a post opposite the ford at the mouth of the Nahr el Auja. They also held a line extending east of Khurbet Hadrah which crossed to the south bank of the river to include Bald Hill and Mulebbis. All three infantry brigades of the 52nd (Lowland) Division managed to cross the River Auja on the night of 20/21 December, completely surprising the defenders who surrendered without firing a shot.Woodward 2006, p. 156 Temporary bridges were subsequently built so the infantry's artillery could cross the river. On 23 December the 52nd (Lowland) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions moved up the coast a further , while the left of the advance reached Arsuf north of Jaffa, capturing key Ottoman defensive positions.

Situation on 30 December 1917 at 1800 Dead Ottoman soldiers at Tel el Ful in 1917 After the Ottoman evacuation, Jerusalem remained within range of Ottoman artillery, and with the opposing sides in such close proximity, there was still the risk of counterattack. An offensive to push the Ottoman Army further northwards away from the city was planned for 24 December 1917, but was delayed due to bad weather.Bruce 2002, p. 168 So the EEF was prepared for battle when the Ottoman Army launched their counterattack at 01:30 on 27 December. This fell on units of the 60th (London) Division holding the Nablus road.Keogh 1955, p. 186Woodward 2006, p. 152 The initial objective of the Ottoman attack, was a line of villages, including Nebi Samweil in front of their starting positions.Grainger 2006, pp. 222‚Äì3 Their focus was towards Tell el Ful, a hill east of the Nablus road about north of Jerusalem defended by the 60th (London) Division. This Ottoman attack on Tell el Ful initially drove the British outposts back and captured several important places. However, the engagement continued for two days and was ultimately unsuccessful. A general EEF infantry advance on a front moved their front line northwards on the right and on the left.Bruce 2002 p. 169 They pushed the whole line along the Nablus road to beyond Ramallah and Bireh by 30 December.Grainger 2006 p. 223 Final objectives were gained and the line along the whole front secured.Wavell 1968 pp 171‚Äì2 In the middle of February 1918 the line was extended eastwards to Jericho in the Jordan Valley, when it was finally secured on the Dead Sea.Jerusalem Memorial 1928, p. 10 =Summation of offensive= Lydda in 1947 The EEF had evolved into a \\"genuinely imperial all‚Äìarms force\\" and the offensive was a \\"nearly ideal instance of the proper use of all arms in combination.\\" The scale of the enormous territorial gains of the Southern Palestine offensive, contrasted with the British offensive on the Western Front at Cambrai. Fought in Flanders from 20 to 30 November, it ended with heavy losses and no territorial gains. The French army was still recovering from a serious mutiny, while the Italians were defeated at the Battle of Caporetto, and Russia was out of the war following the Bolshevik Revolution. Allenby's advance by comparison made considerable territorial gains, helped secure Baghdad and the oilfields at Basra in Mesopotamia, encouraged the Arab Revolt, and inflicted irreplaceable losses on the Ottoman Army. These substantial victories of the EEF's campaign from October to December 1917 resulted in the first military defeat of a Central Power, which led to a substantial loss of enemy territory. In particular the fighting from 31 October to 7 November against the Ottoman Gaza‚ÄìSheria‚ÄìBeersheba line resulted in the first defeat of strongly entrenched, experienced and, up until then, successful Ottoman armies which were supported by artillery, machine guns and aircraft.Grainger 2006, p. 230  Footnotes  = Notes = = Citations =  References                   *  External links  *The Beersheba ANZAC Memorial Center Category:Conflicts in 1917 Category:1917 in British-administered Palestine Category:Ottoman Empire in World War I Category:British Empire in World War I Category:German Empire in World War I Category:Middle Eastern theatre of World War I Sinai and Palestine Category:Military campaigns and theatres of World War I involving Australia Category:Battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign Category:Battles of World War I involving Australia Category:Battles of World War I involving New Zealand Category:Battles of World War I involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles of World War I involving the Ottoman Empire Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Category:Aerial operations and battles of World War I Category:History of the Royal Air Force during World War I Category:October 1917 events Category:November 1917 events Category:December 1917 events ","title":"Southern Palestine Offensive"},{"id":"38380696","text":"Nikoleta Jovanoviƒá (Montenegrin: –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∞ –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ, born 1995 in Bar) is a Montenegrin beauty pageant titleholder who was appointed as Miss Earth Montenegro 2015 and should've represented her country at the Miss Earth 2015 pageant, but at the end she didn't.

Kennedy. The film was written and directed by Peter Landesman, and produced by Playtone's Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, Bill Paxton, and Exclusive Media's Nigel and Matt Sinclair. The film is based on Vincent Bugliosi's 2008 book Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Plot Parkland weaves together the perspectives of a handful of ordinary individuals suddenly thrust into extraordinary circumstances: the young doctors and nurses at Parkland Hospital; Dallas's chief of the Secret Service; a bystander who captured what became the most famous home movie in history; the FBI agents who were visited by Lee Harvey Oswald before the shooting; the brother of Oswald, left to deal with his shattered family; and JFK's security team, witnesses to both the president's death and Vice President Lyndon Johnson's succession to office.

Writer/director Peter Landesman has stated that the film does not explore the various conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The major hospital scenes were filmed in a building housed on the campus of Austin State Hospital in Austin, due to the period look and feel of the building. Release Parkland premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival, and was also screened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Coinciding with the assassination's 50th anniversary year, the film was released theatrically in the United States on October 4, 2013. Reception Parkland received mixed reviews, holding a 50% rating, based on 123 reviews, on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: \\"Although its decision to look at John F. Kennedy's assassination through uncommon perspectives is refreshing, Parkland never achieves the narrative cohesion its subject deserves.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 51/100 rating, signifying \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 5, 2013. Historical accuracy Historian Peter Ling awarded Parkland four out of five stars for enjoyment and three stars for historical accuracy. Reviewing the film, he praised its attempt to \\"capture the desperate efforts made to save Kennedy in the operating room.\\" He told historyextra, \\"It shows that the head nurse, Doris Nelson (played by Marcia Gay Harden), had to take a piece of JFK's skull and some brain tissue from Mrs Kennedy [Jackie picked up a piece of her husband's skull at the scene], and that junior doctor, Jim Carrico (played by Zac Efron), had to be told to stop the frenetic but fruitless cardiac massage at one o'clock, when the team declared JFK dead.\\" However, he noted the \\"suspect influences\\" on Abraham Zapruder's decision to hand over his film to Life magazine. He said, \\"Once copies have been given to the Secret Service and the FBI, Zapruder has to choose from many media outlets who want to buy the film. He chooses Life because he says he respects the publication, but the movie seems to hint that any suppression of the film's contents is in line with Zapruder's wishes, and not because of suspect influences at Life itself, whose managing director [C D Jackson] had CIA connections.\\" See also * Killing Kennedy (2013), a made-for-TV film about the same events, also commemorating the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination. * Bobby (2006), a film detailing events, some fictional, around the RFK assassination, directed by Emilio Estevez.

These are upland marshes occurring in shallow peat-filled valleys, the basins of dried lakes, and the borders of existing lakes. The vegetation mosaic includes a range of mostly herbaceous plant communities, varying based on water depth. Deep water supports various submerged and floating plants. Approximately meter-deep supports emergent herbaceous perennials, typically in dense, monospecific stands; species include bulrush (Typha latifolia), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), American lotus (Nelumbo lutea). Shallow areas only submerged during wet season support more graminoid vegetation, including maidencane (Panicum hemitomon) and southern cutgrass (Leersia hexandra). Subsurface subsidence and changing drainage patterns make these habitats shift and change over time. Soils can be mucky, loamy, or sandy, but they are generally above permeable subsoils that create standing water much of the year. These marshes may also be called meadows or prairies.

The sisters were also highly skilled amateur naturalists and collectors, rare accomplishments for women of their time. They were most notable for their magnificent drawings of moths and butterflies for the publication of the first volume of their father Alexander Walker Scott‚Äôs work Australian Lepidoptera and Their Transformations. Early life Ash Island (artist A.W. Scott) Harriet Scott was the daughter of Alexander Walker Scott, entomologist and entrepreneur and Harriet Scott (n√©e Calcott). Harriet was born in Sydney and she and her sister Helena were educated by their father on Ash Island. Through their education they acquired extensive knowledge of the natural world, including Australian plants, animals and insects. Professional illustrator Aglaosoma lauta & Cerura Australis Harriet earned admiration and praise from leading colonial scientists who she collected for and corresponded with. After the publication of Australian Lepidoptera and their transformations, drawn from the life by Harriet and Helena Scott she was elected an honorary member of the Entomological Society of NSW. However, she was constrained by her class and position in society. Her father suffered financial hardship in the 1860s but no matter how poverty stricken he became, he did not want either of his daughters to accept commissions, sign their own published drawings or be formally educated, however Alexander Scott did finally relent and permitted his daughters signing their published drawings. Harriet was forced to work when he became bankrupt and she drew and painted commercially for the rest of her life. While finishing some plates of birds' eggs for Edward Ramsay in 1866, Harriet asked \\"... above all ... let nobody know you are paying me for doing them for you\\". Harriet drew botanical illustrations for the 1879, 1884 and 1886 editions of the Railway Guide to New South Wales, and with her sister produced designs for Australia‚Äôs first Christmas cards in 1879. Scott married Dr Cosby William Morgan in 1882. Publications Harriet was one of the illustrators for the publication of Australian Lepidoptera and Their Transformations written by her father Alexander Walker Scott. The success of the Lepidoptera presented many opportunities for her and her sister. Apart from gaining honorary membership of the Entomological Society of NSW Harriet received copious requests for commissions. The following decades saw her and Helena produce most of the art for science publications in Sydney including Gerard Krefft‚Äôs Snakes of Australia (1869), Australian Fossil Remains (1870) and Mammals of Australia (1871), Edward Ramsay‚Äôs On the Oology of Australia (proposed but never published) and JC Cox‚Äôs Monograph of Australian Land Shells (1868). Her work is still used by scientists today. The artwork from Snakes of Australia and Mammals of Australia received a Very High Commendation at the Sydney Intercolonial Exhibition in 1870. Death and legacy Harriet died in Granville in 1907 leaving no descendants. Harriet, with her sister Helena, were largely forgotten until the 2011 exhibition Beauty from Nature: art of the Scott Sisters at the Australian Museum in Sydney.

It was formed in 1970 by composer and music conductor Stanis≈Çaw Ga≈Ço≈Ñski (b. 1936), its first director and general manager. Capella Cracoviensis specializes in early music, Renaissance polyphonies, Polish Baroque, and classical chamber music played on period instruments, as well as oratorios, and operatic scores including works of Mozart. The home base for the Orchestra is the historic Krakow Philharmonic Hall located at Zwierzyniecka street. Regular performances in many world- renowned venues have confirmed its status as one of the Poland's most outstanding period instrument ensembles. Profile Interior of Krak√≥w Philharmonic Hall, home of Capella Cracoviensis Capella Cracoviensis (CC) has made numerous CD recordings over the years, most notably of the J. S. Bach Mass in B minor, W. A. Mozart Coronation Mass, and of Darius Milhaud's 6 chamber symphonies and 3 Op√©ras-Minutes. The group performed in many European countries including in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, with the concert held for John Paul II at the Vatican on April 9, 2000, upon his return from the pilgrimage to Bethlehem. The ensemble's performances feature instrumentalists and singers acclaimed in Poland and abroad. Its guest performers as well as concertmasters included Alessandro Moccia of the Orchestre des Champs-√âlys√©es, Alberto Stevanin (Il Giardino Armonico, I Barocchisti of Ravenna, Ensemble Matheus), Fabio Ravasi (Europa Galante), Peter Hanson (Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique); conductors Paul Goodwin, Andrew Parrott, Andreas Spering, Paul McCreesh, Roy Goodman, Fabio Bonizzoni, Matteo Messori and others. The orchestra works on projects with other early music companies such as Nachtmusique and Oltremontano. In 1992 the company received two prestigious awards for their recordings of Milhaud: the French Diapason d'Or, and Grand Prix du Disque of the Acad√©mie Charles Cros. In 2008 a new director was appointed by the city, and a period of transition followed. The orchestra received nearly two million zloty in new-project sponsorship money from the Polish Ministry of Culture in 2011, which is a record for music locally. The funds helped them launch the Verba et Voces festival of early music featuring international stars such as Kai Wessel. The CC produced grand oratorios by Handel (Theodora, Athalia, and Deborah), as well as Le nozze di Figaro by Mozart, along with a series of great Masses and Polish Baroque concerts across the region, which were free of charge. Music director Jan Tomasz Adamus stirred considerable controversy in January 2011 when he requested that all of the CC instrumentalists switch from standard to period instruments, or leave the group if they did not. Eight senior members were dismissed, and organized a street-level protest backed by the union committee, but the changeover has proved beneficial for the company. The CC has experienced a music revival since it switched to old instruments, resulting in renewed interest among the general public and some enthusiastic reviews from the critics (Gazeta.pl; Wyborcza.pl).

It was originally released in 1991 on Wax Trax! Records. Described by lead vocalist Groovie Mann as their \\"sexy\\" album, Sexplosion! is one of the band's biggest commercial and critical successes. Background Vocalist Groovie Mann called Sexplosion! the group's \\"sexy\\" album in 1995, adding that it was \\"total disco\\". He said it was intended as an open-ended fantasy for listeners and that it was genderless in its suggestions. Release Sexplosion! was released in 1991 on Wax Trax! Records. The title track peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs on October 26, 1991. The song \\"Sex on Wheelz\\" peaked at No. 15 on the same chart on July 27, 1991. After appearing on the Cool World soundtrack in 1992, \\"Sex on Wheelz\\" charted again, this time on the Modern Rock Tracks Chart, where it peaked at No. 17 on August 15, 1992. Reception Sexplosion! was well received by critics. Ned Raggett of Allmusic said it was the band's best album, calling it a clever blend of pop music sensibilities and trashiness. He went on to say the album mostly concerned itself with \\"who is doing whom and whether or not there will be enough spangles, muscle boys, and cocktails available.\\" He noted with approval its lounge music vibe in places, as well as its sampling of theme songs from James Bond movies including Thunderball. He particularly praised the album's hit single \\"Sex on Wheelz\\" for its \\"nutty stomp and leer\\" and called it \\"as compressed and propulsive a celebration of fornication and driving as anything else America has ever come up with.\\" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was similarly enthusiastic, and began his review by saying, \\"This record has absolutely no redeeming social value whatsoever, and it's wonderful.\\" He went on to call the album a blend of \\"sleaze ... camp ... and neon stylishness\\", and said it is all about having adult fun. Touring The band toured in support of the album in July 1991. Eric Brace of The Washington Post said the live show was quite strong considering how devoted to camp the band is. He noted Groovie Mann's vocals and the excessive use of smoke machines as the show's primary weak points, while praising the performances of the instrumentalists in the group.

It consists of two intimately coupled parts; a bio-recognition layer and a physicochemical transducer, which acting together converts a biochemical signal to an electronic or optical signal. The bio-recognition layer typically contains an enzyme or another binding protein such as antibody. However, oligonucleotide sequences, sub- cellular fragments such as organelles (e.g. mitochondria) and receptor carrying fragments (e.g. cell wall), single whole cells, small numbers of cells on synthetic scaffolds, or thin slices of animal or plant tissues, may also comprise the bio-recognition layer. It gives the biosensor selectivity and specificity. The physicochemical transducer is typically in intimate and controlled contact with the recognition layer. As a result of the presence and biochemical action of the analyte (target of interest), a physico-chemical change is produced within the biorecognition layer that is measured by the physicochemical transducer producing a signal that is proportionate to the concentration of the analyte. The physicochemical transducer may be electrochemical, optical, electronic, gravimetric, pyroelectric or piezoelectric. Based on the type of biotransducer, biosensors can be classified as shown to the right.  Electrochemical biotransducers  Electrochemical biosensors contain a biorecognition element that selectively reacts with the target analyte and produces an electrical signal that is proportional to the analyte concentration. In general, there are several approaches that can be used to detect electrochemical changes during a biorecognition event and these can be classified as follows: amperometric, potentiometric, impedance, and conductometric. =Amperometric= Amperometric transducers detect change in current as a result of electrochemical oxidation or reduction. Typically, the bioreceptor molecule is immobilized on the working electrode (commonly gold, carbon, or platinum). The potential between the working electrode and the reference electrode (usually Ag/AgCl) is fixed at a value and then current is measured with respect to time. The applied potential is the driving force for the electron transfer reaction. The current produced is a direct measure of the rate of electron transfer. The current reflects the reaction occurring between the bioreceptor molecule and analyte and is limited by the mass transport rate of the analyte to the electrode. =Potentiometric= Potentiometric sensors measure a potential or charge accumulation of an electrochemical cell. The transducer typically comprises an ion selective electrode (ISE) and a reference electrode. The ISE features a membrane that selectively interacts with the charged ion of interest, causing the accumulation of a charge potential compared to the reference electrode. The reference electrode provides a constant half-cell potential that is unaffected by analyte concentration. A high impedance voltmeter is used to measure the electromotive force or potential between the two electrodes when zero or no significant current flows between them. The potentiometric response is governed by the Nernst equation in that the potential is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the analyte. =Impedance= Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) involves measuring resistive and capacitive changes caused by a biorecognition event. Typically, a small amplitude sinusoidal electrical stimulus is applied, causing current to flow through the biosensor. The frequency is varied over a range to obtain the impedance spectrum. The resistive and capacitive components of impedance are determined from in phase and out of phase current responses. Typically, a conventional three-electrode system is made specific to the analyte by immobilizing a biorecognition element to the surface. A voltage is applied and the current is measured. The interfacial impedance between the electrode and solution changes as a result of the analyte binding. An impedance analyzer can be used to control and apply the stimulus as well as measure the impedance changes. =Conductometry= Conductometric sensing involves measuring the change in conductive properties of the sample solution or a medium. The reaction between the biomolecule and analyte changes the ionic species concentration, leading to a change in the solution electrical conductivity or current flow. Two metal electrodes are separated at a certain distance and an AC potential is applied across the electrodes, causing a current flow between the electrodes. During a biorecognition event the ionic composition changes, using an ohmmeter the change in conductance can be measured.  Optical biotransducers  Optical biotransducers, used in optical biosensors for signal transduction, use photons in order to collect information about analyte.Sergey M. Borisov, Otto S. Wolfbeis, Optical Biosensors, Chemical Reviews, 2008, Vol. 108, No. 2 These are highly sensitive, highly specific, small in size and cost effective. The detection mechanism of optical biotransducer depends upon the enzyme system that converts analyte into products which are either oxidized or reduced at the working electrode.Ligler, Frances S.; Rowe Taitt, Chris A. Optical Biosensors - Present & Future. Elsevier.2002 Evanescent field detection principle is most commonly used in an optical biosensor system as the transduction principle . This principle is one of the most sensitive detection methods. It enables the detection of fluorophores exclusively in the close proximity of the optical fiber. A. P. Abel, M. G. Weller, G. L. Duveneck, M. Ehrat, M. Widmer, ‚Äú Fiber-optic Evanescent Wave Biosensors for the Detection of Oligonucleotides‚Äù Anal. Chem, 1996, 68, 2905-2912.  FET-based electronic biotransducers  Electronic biosensing offers significant advantages over optical, biochemical and biophysical methods, in terms of high sensitivity and new sensing mechanisms, high spatial resolution for localized detection, facile integration with standard wafer-scale semiconductor processing and label-free, real-time detection in a nondestructive manner [6]. Devices based on field-effect transistors (FETs) have attracted great attention because they can directly translate the interactions between target biological molecules and the FET surface into readable electrical signals. In a FET, current flows along the channel which is connected to the source and the drain. The channel conductance between the source and the drain is switched on and off by gate electrode that is capacitively coupled through a thin dielectric layer [6]. In FET-based biosensors, the channel is in direct contact with the environment, and this gives better control over the surface charge. This improves the sensitivity of surface FET-based biosensors as biological events occurring at the channel surface could result in the surface potential variation of the semiconductor channel and then modulate the channel conductance. In addition to ease of on-chip integration of device arrays and the cost-effective device fabrication, the surface ultrasensitivity of FET-based biosensors makes it an attractive alternative to existing biosensor technologies[6].  Gravimetric/Piezoelectric biotransducers  Gravimetric biosensors use the basic principle of a response to a change in mass. Most gravimetric biosensors use thin piezoelectric quartz crystals, either as resonating crystals (QCM), or as bulk/surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. In the majority of these the mass response is inversely proportional to the crystal thickness. Thin polymer films are also used in which biomolecules can be added to the surface with known surface mass. Acoustic waves can be projected to the thin film to produce an oscillatory device, which then follows an equation that is nearly identical to the Sauerbrey equation used in the QCM method. Biomolecules, such as proteins or antibodies can bind and its change in mass gives a measureable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample.  Pyroelectric biotransducers  Pyroelectric biosensors generate an electric current as a result of a temperature change. This differential induces a polarization in the substance, producing a dipole moment in the direction of the temperature gradient. The result is a net voltage across the material. This net voltage can be calculated by the following equation.Heimlich et al. Biosensor technology: Fundamentals and applications, Marcel Dekker, INC.: New York, 1990.

He also helped turn the old auto racetrack at Rockingham Park into a horse racing course. Tuckerman and his second wife Milicent founded Little Sunswick Farm. The couple would breed a number of stakes winners including Lavender Hill, 1954's American Champion Older Female Horse. In 1973 he was inducted into the National Racing Hall of Fame.

It was discovered at Pushchino in December 1968, original designation of this pulsar was PP 0943,PSR B0943+10  Pulsar in SIMBAD it became the first pulsar, discovered by Soviet astronomers. Characteristics The pulsar is estimated to be 5 million years old, which is relatively old for a pulsar. It has a rotational period of 1.1 seconds and emits both radio waves and X-rays. Ongoing research at the University of Vermont discovered that the pulsar was found to flip on a roughly a few hours timescale between a radio bright mode with highly organized pulsations and a quieter mode with rather chaotic temporal structure. Moreover, the observations of the pulsar performed simultaneously with the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton X-ray observatory and ground-based radio telescopes revealed that it exhibits variations in its X-ray emission that mimic in reverse the changes seen in radio waves ‚Äì the pulsar has a weaker non-pulsing X-ray luminosity during the radio bright mode and is actually brighter during the radio quiet mode emitting distinct X-ray pulses. Such changes can only be explained if the pulsar's magnetosphere (which may extend up to 52,000 km from the surface) quickly switches between two extreme states. The change happens on a few seconds timescale, far faster than most pulsars. Despite being one of the first pulsars discovered the mechanism for its unusual behavior is unknown. A research group from Peking University published a paper suggesting that the pulsar may actually be a low-mass quark star.

Written by Michael Hitchcock and directed by co-creator Ian Brennan, it aired on Fox in the United States on March 7, 2013, and features the 500th musical number filmed by Glee since its inception. Plot Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) dreams of singing \\"You're All the World to Me\\" with his ex-fianc√©e, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), who left him at the altar, and becomes inspired to assign New Directions to perform songs from their favorite movies. In preparation for Regionals, Will makes it the club's annual mash-up competition, and announces that the winning team will star in a low-budget student film directed by Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale). Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) and Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) lead the club in a performance of \\"Shout\\" to warm up for the competition. In New York City, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Adam Crawford (Oliver Kieran Jones) get stuck in Rachel and Kurt's apartment during a snowstorm and decide to watch Moulin Rouge! together, during which Kurt fantasizes about singing \\"Come What May\\" with Blaine. Santana later voices her suspicions that Brody Weston (Dean Geyer) is a drug dealer after finding a large amount of money in his possession and due to his constant disappearances, which irritates Rachel. In Lima, Ohio, the boys perform a mash-up of \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Danger Zone\\", followed by the girls' performance of \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\" and \\"Material Girl\\". Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) confides with Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) that Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner) kissed her on Valentine's Day, and Finn tricks Emma's parents into revealing that she's at her sister's house, and convinces Will to fight to get her back. Will and New Directions serenade Emma with \\"In Your Eyes\\", and Emma admits she ran away because she feels that she doesn't know Will anymore. They agree to take their relationship slowly. Meanwhile, Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist) admits that his Valentine's Day presents to Marley were Ryder's idea, and invites her to do pottery with him, during which he sings to her \\"Unchained Melody\\". Marley, however, is divided between him and Ryder, and confesses about Ryder kissing her, causing Jake to storm off. In NYC, Kurt admits to Adam that he's still in love with Blaine, but wants to move on, and Adam decides to progress with their relationship, while Santana confronts Rachel about the pregnancy test that she found. Rachel breaks down in her arms, and Santana realizes Rachel might be pregnant. In Lima, Will announces that both groups won the competition and will appear in Artie's movie, and thanks Finn for finding Emma. Finn then admits that he kissed her when she began to have a breakdown over the marriage, and an enraged Will leaves him alone, while the students gather to celebrate their shared victory with a performance of \\"Footloose\\". Production The episode was written by Glee supervising producer Michael Hitchcock and directed by co-creator Ian Brennan. The 500th musical number filmed for the series thus far was shot for it: \\"Shout\\" from the movie Animal House, performed by the show's glee club, New Directions. The song was filmed on January 30, 2013. Recurring characters in this episode include school guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), glee club members Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen), Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell), Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist), Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) and Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner), NYADA senior Adam Crawford (Oliver Kieran Jones), and Emma's parents Rose and Rusty Pillsbury (Valerie Mahaffey and Don Most). The ten songs from the episode, all of which are movie-related, are being released as eight singles. These consist of two mash- ups: \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\" from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and \\"Material Girl\\", based on \\"Sparkling Diamonds\\" from Moulin Rouge! and performed by Benoist and Newell, and \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" from Risky Business and \\"Danger Zone\\" from Top Gun performed by Chord Overstreet and Darren Criss, and six individual songs including \\"Come What May\\" from Moulin Rouge! sung by Criss and Colfer, \\"Unchained Melody\\" from Ghost sung by Artist and Jenner, \\"You're All the World to Me\\" from Royal Wedding performed by Matthew Morrison and Mays, \\"Footloose\\" from the movie of the same name performed by Overstreet, Kevin McHale and Larsen, and \\"In Your Eyes\\" from Say Anything... performed by Morrison and Newell. The proceeds from downloads of the remaining song, \\"Shout\\", which is performed by Criss and Heather Morris with New Directions, are being donated through the end of the fourth season to the Give a Note Foundation, a music education charity for children.

Callahan; who performed, wrote and recorded solo synth-pop music between 1983 and 1986. James Callahan (aka Solitaire) was the first ‚Äútruly computerized‚Äù artist in the Baltimore area. As Solitaire, Callahan played keyboards and electronic drum machines as a one-man show. Live electronics overview Solitaire's performance system was manufactured by Sequential Circuits (SCI). It consisted of the Sequential Circuits Six-Trak a six-voice, polyphonic, analogue synthesizer that was among the first MIDI instruments designed to be used with a computer. The computer and software allowed Solitaire to program the Six-Trak sequencer and SCI's Drumtraks to form one of the earliest known MIDI-based [live] performance systems. In 1984 the system used by Solitaire was said to \\"create instruments that have never been heard before,\\" at that time \\"musicians [were] just beginning to tap its potential\\". However, by modern computer standards the electronic rhythm section used by Solitaire was crude and had several limitations. For example, the SCI Model 64 Sequencer was limited to six voice sequencing. To play back more songs required sequences be saved to disk (loading of disk sequences had to be done live, on stage, during the performance). Live performance reaction From 84‚Äì85 Solitaire performed at numerous clubs and colleges in the USA mid-Atlantic region, both as a headliner and as a supporting act for bands such as MCA recording artists The Ravyns. Many of Solitaire's early club performances were documented by rock journalists from Maryland Musician Magazine. Solitaire was frequently mentioned in Maryland Musician articles such as the Baltimore-centric Red Rocker Report and the Sammie‚Äôs Jammin‚Äô column who wrote, ‚Äùit all sounded damn good especially since he [Solitaire] was the only one on stage along with a monster stack of keyboards and one in hand . . . bravo.\\"Kidd, Bill. (November 1985). Sammie's jammin. Maryland Musician Magazine, 11(85). Print Solitaire's live performances continued to be met positively and in 1986 Solitaire [James Callahan] was voted Maryland's \\"Best keyboard player\\" in the Maryland Musician Magazine 2nd Annual Readers poll.Staff. (August 1986). 2ND Annual reader's poll. Maryland Musician Magazine, 8(86). Print Recordings In 1985 Solitaire released the 7-inch single \\"System Overload\\" b/w \\"Nothing Left to Say\\". The single enjoyed limited success locally but was later \\"discovered\\" by European DJ's and became a highly sought after record. Upon its initial release a regional critic described it as \\"an ambitious but somewhat compromised mixture of new wave. 'System Overload' is top heavy with beat box and electronic percussions [with] a synth laden metronomic melody\\". In contrast 'Nothing Left to Say' is a wistful little ballad whose lyrics preen with a clever romanticism\\".Gill, Doug. (November 1985). Record reactions. Maryland Musician Magazine, 11(85). Print In 1986 Callahan played keyboards and recorded for the new wave rock band Toy Soldier, whose album Forward March was produced by Rob Fahey (Ravyns) and recorded at Sheffield Studios, MD. The group released the single \\"Never my Love\\" on the Texas-based Yellow Rose Records Label.CREEM Magazine. Vol. 18 No. 2, Toy Soldier Debut LP \\"Forward March\\". Birmingham, MI: Cambray Publishing Inc., 1986. p. 2 inside cover. Print Unfortunately in late 1986 James‚Äô music career was halted due to ill health after being diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs Disease.Solitaire Music Net Official Archive. Retrieved from http://www.solitairemusic.net Musical comparisons Solitaire was often compared to English solo synth-pop artists of the period such as the UK‚Äôs Thomas Dolby and Howard Jones. From a performance technology standpoint Solitaire more closely mirrored Jones who during his Human's Lib tour 1983‚Äì84 decided to forgo a band and perform solo Howard Jones Fan Site using only automated accompaniment. Howard Jones notes that during early performances he, ‚Äútriggered sequencers live on stage whilst playing and singing, something that no one had done before\\". Although Jones's claim is not disputed, Solitaire may be considered the first American synth-pop act who can claim similar ‚Äútechnological firsts‚Äù: playing and singing on stage completely solo, accompanied only by a computer, 5 ¬º-inch floppy disks and synthesizers. With health issues looming and without chart support from his debut single, Solitaire‚Äôs notoriety never reached that of his UK solo synth counterparts. Despite heavy tour schedules up until 1986 and national promotion in American publications such as Star Hits, pg. 24. Print. Solitaire‚Äôs international recognition as a synth-pop pioneer would not come for another twenty years. Renewed interest 2001 saw the first reappearance of Solitaire‚Äôs music. Solitaire attributes the international interest to his longtime friend and collaborator Tony Prescott (keyboardist for Liverpool 1980s synth-pop band Cook da Books). Prescott helped Solitaire gain global exposure by introducing his early works to Australian sound engineer Mark Woods. Woods known for his indie label e-pop, and work as sound engineer for 1980s Aussie-based bands such as INXS and Men at Work mastered and released a number of previously unreleased Solitaire tracks on a CD entitled \\"Solitaire: Selected Tracks‚Äù on Woods own e-pop label in Australia. The Solitaire CD released by e-pop renewed international interest in Solitaire. The original 7-inch single \\"System Overload\\" was \\"discovered\\" by European DJs and became a highly sought after record. Solitaire landed a distribution deal with EraRecords, Netherlands who re-released the original 7\\" recording. International attention for Solitaire continued when his 1984 recording \\"After Darkness\\" was released on the 2007 Anna Logue Records compilation LP Echoes From Our Past, in Germany. German critics appreciated Solitaire's early dark electronic synth-pop. One European critic wrote, \\"The American solo project Solitaire is bringing his despair into sound with a catchy dark electropop\\". In 2002 Solitaire formed Solitaire Music, a studio project, with keyboardist Paul Demme releasing records into the 00s including the Baltimore release entitled \\"Retrophaze: Digital Folklore‚Äù in 2004. In 2008 SolitaireMusic.Net released a 12 song digital LP entitled ‚ÄúSolitaire ‚Äì Best Of: 83‚Äì86‚Äù on various MP3 download and streaming media sites.

Synopsis Sheldon is forced to take care of Amy when she gets sick, thanks to a special clause he built into their Relationship Agreement. He takes care of her the way his mother did by putting a damp cloth on her forehead, singing to her and naively rubbing VapoRub on her chest, which excites Amy. He also reads to her from a science textbook as if it were a bedtime story. She loves the extra attention (as well as being bathed by Sheldon) so much that she continues to pretend to be sick even after she has recovered. When Sheldon finally discovers that Amy tricked him, he tells her that his father would have spanked him for the ruse she has pulled (he thinks of corporal punishment), and though he doesn't want to hurt her, the idea excites Amy (she thinks of erotic spanking). Meanwhile, Howard is forced to have his in-laws over for dinner. Bernadette volunteers him to go on a fishing trip with her macho father. Howard has no clue how to fish, so he enlists Penny to teach him. Howard, Leonard and Raj all find handling the worms and preparing dead fish to be disgusting. Howard eventually tells Bernadette's father, Mike, that he does not want to go fishing and discovers that Mike does not want to go either, admitting that his wife makes him go fishing often. They bond over being bossed around by the women in their lives and then the two of them decide to go to a casino instead and Mike offers to teach him to play craps. In the final scene, Amy plays mood music before receiving the first spank, and is excited after receiving it. Sheldon tells her she should not be enjoying her punishment; she responds that he should spank harder, which he agrees.

The Big Bang Theory was also the highest rated television show of the night. =Reception= Jesse Schedeen from IGN gave this episode an 8.3/10 and called this episode \\"a new romantic milestone for Sheldon and Amy\\". Jesse praised \\"Some clever subversion of typical sitcom gender roles\\" and \\"Plenty of funny awkwardness at Casa de Wolowitz\\" in this episode. However, Jesse also said that \\"the Sheldon/Amy plot ended on a creepy note\\", he thought \\"Raj deserves more varied material\\", too. Oliver Sava from The A.V. Club gave this episode a B. She praised the Howard storyline, and said \\"when the writers put [Howard's marriage] at the forefront, the episodes are fresher and have a stronger emotional hook\\". She also felt that the Sheldon and Amy storyline was OK, but the last scene that shows Sheldon spanking Amy was kinky and creepy to her.

The University of Dhaka, established in 1921, acted as the driving force in producing many renowned scientists in Bangladesh. Since its independence in 1971, Bangladesh has been plagued with many social issues like poverty, illiteracy etc. Hence, science and technology have lagged behind in the priority list of the successive governments. However, induced by the recent economic progress, science and technology has been witnessing intense growth in the country after a period of stagnation, most notably in the information technology and biotechnology sectors. The national policies for science and technology is planned and developed by the National Council for Science and Technology which is controlled by the ministry of science and technology.  History  According to the recent excavations made at the archaeological site of Wari-Bateshwar, it can be said that the history of science and technology in Bangladesh starts in the Chalcolithic age; some evidences of pit-dwelling from that period were found in those excavations. The history of modern science began after the arrival of the British empire in the country. The educational reforms during this period gave birth to many distinguished scientists in the region. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, born in Bikrampur of present-day Munshiganj District of Bangladesh, pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made very significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian subcontinent.Chatterjee, Santimay and Chatterjee, Enakshi, Satyendranath Bose, 2002 reprint, p. 5, National Book Trust, IEEE named him one of the fathers of radio science. He was the first person from the Indian subcontinent to receive a US patent, in 1904. In 1924‚Äì25, while researching at the University of Dhaka, Prof Satyendra Nath Bose well known for his works in quantum mechanics, provided the foundation for Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics and the theory of the Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. After the Partition of India in 1947, Bangladesh or erstwhile East Bengal (later named as East Pakistan) became a part of the Muslim majority country of Pakistan and several talented Hindu scientists of Bangladeshi origin decided for moving to India because of the growing communal dissonance in the region. The regional branch of Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research was established in 1955 in Dhaka, which was the first scientific research organisation in East Pakistan. It was later renamed as Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The economic and other discriminations towards East Pakistan and extensive investments in militarisation by the central Government of Pakistan led to a slow growth in the positive development of science and technology in this period. At the time of independence of Bangladesh, there were six research organisations with twenty institutions operating under their authority. After gaining independence in 1971, some more research institutions began to be established. Several universities were also established focusing on major disciplines of science and technology. In 1983, the National Committee on Science and Technology was created, having the President of Bangladesh as its head, to set up a national policy. The Government of Bangladesh passed a university act in 1986 to give special importance in science and technology education. Shahjalal University of Science and Technology was established as the first specialised science & technology university of the country. After SUST, seven more science and technology universities have been established in Bangladesh.

He matriculated from the CMS High School, Thrissur in 1899 and did the FA Course in the Maharaja's College, Ernakulam and graduated from the Presidency College, Madras in 1903. He took his degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery in 1912 from the Madras Medical College and then joined the Cochin Government Service. While in service, he went to England for higher studies in Medicine. During the World War I, Poduval was recruited in England for war service and went to Mesopotamia and Burma as an army doctor. In recognition of his war service, he was appointed as Captain and was reinstated in the Cochin Government Service. Again he went to Germany in 1928 to take his MD Degree from the University of Hamburg. Returning from Germany, Poduval continued as Civil Surgeon, mostly in Thrissur and Ernakulam. He retired from the service as Director of Public Health, in 1939. Shortly after retirement, Poduval died at the age of 56, after a brief illness at his house \\"Umaramam\\" in Trichur. It was the famous Malayalam poet Vallathole who gave the name for his newly built house. He was also the founder president of the Indian Medical Association, Trichur. Artistry Even as a young boy, Poduval had shown extra ordinary talent in art and wanted to take art as a profession. It was while he was a student in Madras that he came to develop a close acquaintance with the great master of Indian art, the late Raja Ravi Varma. In a letter written in 1904, Varma recommended Poduval for a state scholarship to study art in Europe. Varma, on seeing his art collections wrote \\"Considering that he had been engaged till recently in his university studies, devoting only his leisure hours to drawing, the progress he has made in it seems to be remarkable. Now that he has passed his BA examination, his object seems to be to take art as a profession ‚Äì a very laudable ambition indeed for one so gifted. With liberal education he has received, and with his natural talents for art, if he undergoes a term of training in Europe, I have no doubt he would make a name for himself as an artist\\". This letter handwritten by Varma dated 24 February 1904 is preserved in the Poduval Collections. But because his family's preference, Poduval was forced to take up Medicine as his profession. While in England, he got a chance to take a course in art, attending evening classes. But his instructors suggested that he should not spoil his own individual style of art by formal training. His travels abroad gave him a chance to realise his long cherished ambition of visiting the famous galleries of art in Europe. Wherever he went, Poduval always had his sketch-book or easel with him. He wielded his scalpel and the paint brush with equal dexterity. The experience he gathered during his journey around the world as a part of his medical profession when he was in military service during World War I reflected in his works with the absolute authenticity of realism a surgeon could impart in painting along with his rational imagination and values of aesthetics. Pencil, charcoal, oil, tempera and water were the mediums he was comfortable with, but his favourite medium was water colour in which his talents were remarkable. As he was a busy surgeon, the time he could devote for art was very little and this limitation forced may pictures to remain unfinished. Still he has left behind a good collection of paintings and sketches. The first solo exhibition of his paintings was held in 1955 at the museum centenary hall, Madras. It was inaugurated by Mr V K Krishna Menon who remarked that Poduval's paintings directly communicate with the ordinary individual. In 1966, the Kerala Lalithakala Academy honoured Dr Poduval by celebrating his birth anniversary and unveiling his portrait. In 1996, another exhibition of his paintings was held Academy Gallery in Trichur. Poduval was a highly industrious person and in spite of his busy life as a top ranking medical surgeon, he found time not only to practise art, but also to write articles and gave lectures, both in English and in Malayalam, relating to Medicine, art and various other topical subjects. This article written by Dr A R Poduval was so much appreciated by Mahatma Gandhi that he got it reprinted in Young India One of his articles, \\"The Creative Delight\\" was so much appreciated by Mahatma Gandhi that he got it reprinted in Young India. Gandhi wrote \\"Under the heading 'The Creative Delight' there appears in St. Berchmans' College Magazine a very readable and thought provoking article by Capt. A R Poduval of Cochin. Though for the pages of 'Young India' it may be considered somewhat long, I have not had the courage to mutilate it. I present the reader with the whole of Capt. Poduval's article in the hope that it will bring converts to the great cause of Daridranarayan.\\" The article, with Gandhi's introduction was again published in The Hindu of August 1929. Poduval's family He belonged to the well-known family of Ambadi in Thrissur. His father was T Sesha Iyer. His mother died while he was very young and he was looked after by a relative, who he called 'Ammini Amma'. He was married to Thekke Kuruppath Parukutty Amma who was a great help and support to him in his medical and artistic career.

Duties  The Office of the Legislative Counsel is a team of specialist government lawyers who draft Welsh laws. The office's main role is to give effect to Welsh Government policies by drafting legislation. The office also advises the Welsh Government on matters of legislative competence, interpretation and procedure. The office is accountable to the Counsel General for Wales, a member of the Welsh Government. Welsh primary legislation must fall within the devolved competence of Senedd Cymru (the Welsh Parliament) and be consistent with European law and the rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. The Office drafts legislation in both Welsh and English: Acts of the Senedd must be enacted in both languages, with each language having equal legal status. The office also seeks to draft legislation in a way that is consistent with the Welsh Government‚Äôs wider responsibility to the rule of law. The way in which laws are drafted make a key contribution to a properly functioning legal system: laws must be drafted clearly to promote public understanding and to avoid unfair enforcement; laws must avoid contradictions; and laws must not command the impossible. The Office of the Legislative Counsel shares a responsibility, along with legislators and policy makers, to maintain the clarity and order of laws applicable to Wales on what is commonly referred to as the statute book. Working within a single England and Wales jurisdiction and within the context of existing legislation that was enacted both for Wales and England (or the United Kingdom as a whole), the aim is to separate and demarcate Welsh laws where practicable.

The film had its World Premiere at South By Southwest in 2013, followed by its UK Premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film centres around Melanie (Nora Tschirner), whose life is going nowhere. When a mysterious man, Ray (Rob Knighton), comes into town, she sees an opportunity to save herself. Attempting to leave their pasts behind and move on, the pair endeavours to change their lives for the better. Plot We first see Melanie (Nora Tschirner), a young German woman who's moved to an English seaside town to be with her fianc√©, dressed as Charlie Chaplin, the morning after a party. Her fianc√© has left her there, which is where she meets Ali (Kellie Shirley) who offers to find her a job waitressing. She seems to be drifting, with no job, money or friends - her aimless existence broken up by supervising her fianc√©'s niece ‚Äì a task that she doesn't appear to relish. She meets 50-something Ray (Rob Knighton), when he offers to pay for the coffee that she can't afford. Ray looks and sounds like a clich√©d East End hitman, and we soon learn that it's not far from the truth... but it's not the whole truth. Ray has returned to the town he grew up in to pay his respects to his recently deceased brother's family. Their relationship grows slowly, as they reveal confidences, share awkward, darkly funny situations (meeting Ray's eccentric relatives) and enjoy being together. When Ray & Melanie meet Ray's niece Laura (Madeline Duggan) it sparks a new effort in Ray to deal with his family past. For Laura, it‚Äôs her chance to find a confidante in her uncle. After a long day together, where they are closer than ever, Melanie gets a call from Ali saying there is a job going at the restaurant she works at, Beavers. Reluctantly, Melanie says yes and leaves Ray to start work as a roller skating waitress. It‚Äôs rock bottom for her, and later that night she leaves and wanders to ‚Äòtheir spot‚Äô, on the harbour. Only to find Ray there, in a similar state of mind. This is the turning point for both of them. Melanie jumps into the harbour to challenge Ray‚Äôs fear of water. He jumps in after her and together they agree now is the time to stop looking back and start looking forward. Melanie goes home and packs her things ‚Äì not a lot admittedly ‚Äì while Ray attends to his own unfinished business. As Melanie takes the train out of town she looks out at the landscape speeding past, whilst a familiar figure walks through the carriage.

Born in West Hollywood and raised in Woodland Hills, California, he currently resides in Brooklyn, New York City. After a short career in battle rap that started in late 2008, in which he appeared in American circuits such as Grindtime and Smack/URL, as well as outside the United States, notably in Canada (KOTD) and United Kingdom (Don't Flop), he retired from the scene to focus his attention on his musical career in early 2010. He is a member of the Brown Bag AllStars, a collective of emcees and producers from the Brooklyn area. Music career Soul Khan started his rap career after he met his current group, The Brown Bag Allstars while working at Fat Beats in Manhattan, NY. In late 2010, Soul Khan released his free album Soul Like Khan. The following year, he started releasing his Love Supreme series, four EPs in dedication to John Coltrane's legendary album by the same name, A Love Supreme. The first EP, Acknowledgement was produced by DeeJay Element with an upbeat approach to help listeners feel \\"renewed.\\" The second EP, Resolution, was produced by Marink. Pursuance EP, produced by Audible Doctor is the third and Psalm, produced by Abnormal completed the series. Soul Khan's song \\"Speeding Bullets\\" was also on the 2012 compilation album College Radio Day. Soul Khan performed at 2013 Bonnaroo with Black Violin, Jeni Suk, & Knower as the collective \\"Sooper Groop.\\". Soul Khan lists Pharoahe Monch, Posdnous, Paul Robeson, & David Ruffin as musical influences. Soul Khan was listed in Allhiphop's Top 50 Underground Hip Hop Artists of 2012. Battle career Soul Khan burst onto the battle scene with a decisive victory over Yellow Rat Bassterd in a 2008 GrindTimeNow battle. From here Khan continued to battle in the GrindTimeNow circuit against many other GrindTimeNow heavyweights such as Cortez and Syd Vicious. Soul Khan's popularity grew within battle rap as more and more fans were being introduced to the subculture. In early 2010 a fresh-shaven Soul Khan made his first appearance on the Ultimate Rap League(URL) stage against an Ohio rapper named Deacon Frost. Although this battle was highly debated, it is an example of why Soul Khan is so highly respected amongst many different battle rap leagues, and has such a diverse following of fans. Also in 2010 Soul Khan had two international battle rap performance in Canada's main battle league King of the Dot (KOTD) where he defeated Aspire, and top ranked Canadian battler Porich in a controversial decision. Soul Khan continued to battle throughout 2010 in GrindTimeNow against other big names such as QP (SONS), Madness, and Fresco until he eventually got invited for another international appearance. This time Khan appeared in the United Kingdom on the prominent Don't Flop stage where he battled Don't Flop veteran Sensa in a classic three round clash. Soul Khan went on to perform one more battle on the URL main stage in December 2010 against SONS rapper Fox, in what is widely considered one of the most one-sided battles in URL history. Soul Khan announced his retirement from battle rap for the sake of wanting to focus on his more lucrative music career, and getting out while he was still on top. Occasionally, Khan attends big name battle rap events as either a guest judge, or even just as a fan of the battle rap culture, but has stated that he has no intention of ever coming back to battling. In a recent interview with buzzntheburgh.com, Soul Khan reiterated that he will never battle rap again unless his music career took off dramatically. After retiring from battle rap, Soul Khan became outspoken about his regret over using language that many consider offensive to marginalized groups like the LGBT community and women. Since as early as 2012, he has expressed his remorse on social media, and explained his stance at greater length in interviews. This sentiment led to backlash from some fans, to whom Soul Khan has often responded directly, maintaining his criticism of his past actions. Soul Khan returned to the battle scene on November 24th 2019, competing against Dizaster via an exclusive PPV event hosted by KOTD. .

Adolf Ellegard Jensen (1 January 1899 ‚Äì 20 May 1965) was one of the most important German ethnologists of the first half of the 20th century. Jensen's main research interests were myth, ritual and cult. He furthered the theory of Cultural Morphology founded by Leo Frobenius. Jensen is mostly known for his research on religious sacrifice that led him to the introduction of the concept of Dema Deity.The study of religion(s) in Western Europe II - Michael Stausberg His best-known work is 'Myth and Cult Among Primitive Peoples', published in 1951. Life Jensen studied physics in Kiel and in Bonn, concluding his studies with a dissertation on Max Planck and Ernst Mach in 1922. One year later he became acquainted with Leo Frobenius and became his faithful disciple. As a member of the Institute for Cultural Morphology founded by Frobenius and known today as Frobenius Institute, Jensen took part in research journeys to South Africa, Libya, Southern Ethiopia and Seram Island in the Moluccas. He became a full-time ethnologist after publishing a paper on circumcision and rite of passage ceremonies.Short Portrait: Adolf Ellegaard Jensen He held a teaching position at the University of Frankfurt beginning in 1925.Karl-Heinz Kohl, Editha Platte (editor): Gestalter und Gestalten. 100 Jahre Ethnologie in Frankfurt am Main. Frankfurt a. M. and Basel 2006 During the Third Reich Jensen was chosen to be appointed to lead the Frobenius Institute, also known as Institute for Cultural Morphology, as well as Frankfurt's Museum of Ethnology (Museum f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde) after Frobenius' death in 1938. However, his appointment fell through owing to the opposition of the Nazi authorities, who also withdrew his Venia legendi in the University of Frankfurt, for Jensen had not divorced his Jewish wife. Finally in 1945, after Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, Jensen was appointed Director of the Frobenius Institute, as well as Director of Frankfurt's Museum of Ethnology. He would keep both posts until his death.Frobenius Institut, Ad. E. Jensen Memorial Lecture Together with fellow ethnologist Franz Termer, Jensen reestablished the German Anthropological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde) which he led between 1947 and 1954. This organization had to be established anew during the postwar reconstruction of West Germany Along with Frobenius himself, Jensen is one of the most important representatives of the Cultural Morphology viewpoint. At the center of his theoretical work stood the concepts of 'emotion' (Ergriffenheit), 'expression' (Ausdruck) and 'application' (Anwendung), which he sought to identify in the religious manifestations of indigenous people groups. His criticism was directed mainly against cultural evolutionism, as well as some other theories in ethnology and anthropology. He argued against those scholars who sustained that there is a \\"primitive mentality\\" distinct from modern methods of thought.Adolf Ellegard Jensen, Myth and Cult among Primitive Peoples, University of Chicago Press, 1963 Jensen is renowned for having introduced the concept of 'Dema deity', a term that he took from the language of the Marind-anim people of New Guinea, in ethnology. According to Jensen the belief in a Dema deity is typical of cultures based on basic plant cultivation as opposed to cultures of hunter-gatherers, as well as complex agricultural cultures such as those based on the cultivation of grain. Jensen identifies the veneration of Dema deities in the context of many different cultures worldwide. He assumes that it dates back to the Neolithic revolution in the early history of mankind. One of the main characteristics of Dema deities is that they are killed by the men of their community and hacked to pieces which are strewn about or buried: from their dismembered bodies the staple agricultural products grow forth.Adolf E. Jensen, Myth and Cult among Primitive Peoples, University of Chicago Press, 1963, pp. 88-111 Jensen developed this concept through the Hainuwele legend, an important origin myth from the folklore of the Wemale people in Seram that he himself recorded.The Oxford Companion to World Mythology - Hainuwele This myth was recorded by Jensen along with many other myths of the oral tradition of the Maluku Islands during a 1937-8 Frobenius Institute expedition.Adolf Ellegard Jensen: Hainuwele.

In the gas phase vibronic transitions are accompanied by changes in rotational energy also. Vibronic spectra of diatomic molecules have been analysed in detail;Available for download at community books emission spectra are more complicated than absorption spectra. The intensity of allowed vibronic transitions is governed by the Franck‚ÄìCondon principle. Vibronic spectroscopy may provide information, such as bond-length, on electronic excited states of stable molecules. It has also been applied to the study of unstable molecules such as dicarbon, C2, in discharges, flames and astronomical objects.Hollas, p. 211.  Principles  Electronic transitions are typically observed in the visible and ultraviolet regions, in the wavelength range approximately 200‚Äì700 nm (50,000‚Äì14,000 cm‚àí1), whereas fundamental vibrations are observed below about 4000 cm‚àí1.Energy is related to wavenumber by E=hc \\\\bar u, where h=Planck's constant and c is the velocity of light When the electronic and vibrational energy changes are so different, vibronic coupling (mixing of electronic and vibrational wave functions) can be neglected and the energy of a vibronic level can be taken as the sum of the electronic and vibrational (and rotational) energies; that is, the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation applies.Banwell and McCash, p. 162. The overall molecular energy depends not only on the electronic state but also on vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, denoted v and J respectively for diatomic molecules. It is conventional to add a double prime (v\\", J\\") for levels of the electronic ground state and a single prime (v', J') for electronically excited states. Each electronic transition may show vibrational coarse structure, and for molecules in the gas phase, rotational fine structure. This is true even when the molecule has a zero dipole moment and therefore has no vibration-rotation infrared spectrum or pure rotational microwave spectrum.Banwell and McCash, p. 163. It is necessary to distinguish between absorption and emission spectra. With absorption the molecule starts in the ground electronic state, and usually also in the vibrational ground state v=0 because at ordinary temperatures the energy necessary for vibrational excitation is large compared to the average thermal energy. The molecule is excited to another electronic state and to many possible vibrational states v'=0, 1, 2, 3, ... . With emission, the molecule can start in various populated vibrational states, and finishes in the electronic ground state in one of many populated vibrational levels. The emission spectrum is more complicated than the absorption spectrum of the same molecule because there are more changes in vibrational energy level. The Morse potential (blue) and harmonic oscillator potential (green). The potential at infinite internuclear distance is the dissociation energy for pure vibrational spectra. For vibronic spectra there are two potential curves (see Figure at right), and the dissociation limit is the upper state energy at infinite distance. Energy level diagram illustrating the Franck‚ÄìCondon principle. Transitions between v = 0 and v' = 2 are favored For absorption spectra, the vibrational coarse structure for a given electronic transition forms a single progression, or series of transitions with a common level, here the lower level v = 0.Hollas, p. 214 There are no selection rules for vibrational quantum numbers, which are zero in the ground vibrational level of the initial electronic ground state, but can take any integer values in the final electronic excited state. The term values G(v) for a harmonic oscillator are given by : G(v) = \\\\bar u _{electronic} + \\\\omega_e (v+{1 \\\\over 2}) \\\\, where v is a vibrational quantum number, œâe is the harmonic wavenumber. In the next approximation the term values are given by : G(v) = \\\\bar u _{electronic} + \\\\omega_e (v+{1 \\\\over 2}) - \\\\omega_e\\\\chi_e (v+{1 \\\\over 2})^2\\\\, where œáe is an anharmonicity constant. This is, in effect, a better approximation to the Morse potential near the potential minimum. The spacing between adjacent vibrational lines decreases with increasing quantum number because of anharmonicity in the vibration. Eventually the separation decreases to zero when the molecule photo- dissociates into a continuum of states. The second formula is adequate for small values of the vibrational quantum number. For higher values further anharmonicity terms are needed as the molecule approaches the dissociation limit, at the energy corresponding to the upper (final state) potential curve at infinite internuclear distance. The intensity of allowed vibronic transitions is governed by the Franck‚ÄìCondon principle.Hollas, p. 215. Since electronic transitions are very fast compared with nuclear motions, vibrational levels are favored when they correspond to a minimal change in the nuclear coordinates, that is, when the transition is \\"vertical\\" on the energy level diagram. Each line has a finite linewidth, dependent on a variety of factors.Hollas, pp. 30‚Äì33. Vibronic spectra of diatomic molecules in the gas phase have been analyzed in detail.Hollas, pp. 210‚Äì228 Vibrational coarse structure can sometimes be observed in the spectra of molecules in liquid or solid phases and of molecules in solution. Related phenomena including photoelectron spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy, luminescence, and fluorescence are not discussed in this article, though they also involve vibronic transitions.  Diatomic molecules  The vibronic spectra of diatomic molecules in the gas phase also show rotational fine structure. Each line in a vibrational progression will show P- and R- branches. For some electronic transitions there will also be a Q-branch. The transition energies, expressed in wavenumbers, of the lines for a particular vibronic transition are given, in the rigid rotor approximation, that is, ignoring centrifugal distortion, byBanwell and McCash, p. 171 :G(J^\\\\prime, J^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}) = \\\\bar u _{v^\\\\prime-v^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}+B^\\\\prime J^\\\\prime (J^\\\\prime +1)-B^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} J^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(J^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} +1) Here B are rotational constants and J are rotational quantum numbers. (For B also, a double prime indicates the ground state and a single prime an electronically excited state.) The values of the rotational constants may differ appreciably because the bond length in the electronic excited state may be quite different from the bond length in the ground state, because of the operation of the Franck-Condon principle. The rotational constant is inversely proportional to the square of the bond length. Usually B‚Ä≤ < B‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ as is true when an electron is promoted from a bonding orbital to an antibonding orbital, causing bond lengthening. But this is not always the case; if an electron is promoted from a non-bonding or antibonding orbital to a bonding orbital, there will be bond- shortening and B‚Ä≤ > B‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. Fortrat diagram created with B‚Ä≤=0.8, B‚Ä≤‚Ä≤=1, showing displacement of rotational lines from the vibrational line position (at 0 cm‚àí1). Centrifugal distortion is ignored in this diagram. The treatment of rotational fine structure of vibronic transitions is similar to the treatment of rotation-vibration transitions and differs principally in the fact that the ground and excited states correspond to two different electronic states as well as to two different vibrational levels. For the P-branch J^\\\\prime = J^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}-1 , so that :\\\\bar u_P = \\\\bar u _{v'-v}+B' (J -1)J-BJ(J+1) ::= \\\\bar u _{v'-v} - (B '+B)J + (B'-B){J}^2 Similarly for the R-branch J = J'-1 , and :\\\\bar u_R = \\\\bar u _{v'-v}+B'J'(J'+1)-BJ'(J'-1) ::= \\\\bar u _{v'-v} + (B '+B)J' + (B'-B){J'}^2 Thus, the wavenumbers of transitions in both P- and R- branches are given, to a first approximation, by the single formulaStraughan and Walker, p. 74 : \\\\bar u_{P,R} = \\\\bar u _{v^\\\\prime,v^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}+(B ^\\\\prime+B^{\\\\prime\\\\prime})m +(B^\\\\prime-B^{\\\\prime\\\\prime})m^2,\\\\quad m=\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 2 \\\\ etc. Here positive m values refer to the R-branch (with m = +J ‚Ä≤ = J +1) and negative values refer to the P-branch (with m = -J ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤). The wavenumbers of the lines in the P-branch, on the low wavenumber side of the band origin at \\\\bar u _{v^\\\\prime,v^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}, increase with m. In the R-branch, for the usual case that B‚Ä≤ < B‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, as J increases the wavenumbers at first lie increasingly on the high wavenumber side of the band origin but then start to decrease, eventually lying on the low wavenumber side. The Fortrat diagram illustrates this effect.When centrifugal distortion is included the R-branch lines below the vibrational origin do not coincide with P-branch lines In the rigid rotor approximation the line wavenumbers lie on a parabola which has a maximum at :x=-\\\\frac{B^\\\\prime + B^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}}{2(B^\\\\prime-B^{\\\\prime\\\\prime})} The line of highest wavenumber in the R-branch is known as the band head. It occurs at the value of m which is equal to the integer part of x, or of (x+1). When a Q- branch is allowed for a particular electronic transition, the lines of the Q-branch correspond to the case ‚àÜJ=0, J‚Ä≤=J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ and wavenumbers are given byHollas, p. 172. :\\\\bar u_Q=\\\\bar u _{v',v}+(B'-B)J(J+1) \\\\quad J=1, 2 \\\\ etc. The Q-branch then consists of a series of lines with increasing separation between adjacent lines as J increases. When B‚Ä≤Banwell and McCash, p. 174 illustrates a spectrum with pre-dissociation. = Applications = Spectrum of the blue flame from a butane torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and Swan bands due to C2. The analysis of vibronic spectra of diatomic molecules provides information concerning both the ground electronic state and the excited electronic state. Data for the ground state can also be obtained by vibrational or pure rotational spectroscopy, but data for the excited state can only be obtained from the analysis of vibronic spectra. For example, the bond length in the excited state may be derived from the value of the rotational constant B‚Ä≤. In addition to stable diatomic molecules, vibronic spectroscopy has been used to study unstable species, including CH, NH, hydroxyl radical, OH, and cyano radical, CN.Banwell and McCash, p. 176 The Swan bands in hydrocarbon flame spectra are a progression in the C-C stretching vibration of the dicarbon radical, C2 for the d^3\\\\Pi_u \\\\Leftrightarrow a^3\\\\Pi_g electronic transition.Gaydon, p. 259. Vibronic bands for 9 other electronic transitions of C2 have been observed in the infrared and ultraviolet regions.  Polyatomic molecules and ions  Formaldehyde For polyatomic molecules, progressions are most often observed when the change in bond lengths upon electronic excitation coincides with the change due to a ‚Ä≥totally symmetric‚Ä≥ vibration.In a ‚Ä≥totally symmetric‚Ä≥ vibration the lengths of all symmetrically-equivalent bonds vary in phase with each other. The symmetry of the molecule is the same in the vibrational excited state as in the vibrational ground state. This is the same process that occurs in resonance Raman spectroscopy. For example, in formaldehyde (methanal), H2CO, the n ‚Üí œÄ* transition involves excitation of an electron from a non-bonding orbital to an antibonding pi orbital which weakens and lengthens the C-O bond. This produces a long progression in the C-O stretching vibration. Another example is furnished by benzene, C6H6. In both gas and liquid phase the band around 250 nm shows a progression in the symmetric ring-breathing vibration.Hollas shows the vibration on p. 140 (Fig.6.13f) and the spectrum on p. 245 Absorption spectrum of an aqueous solution of potassium permanganate As an example from inorganic chemistry the permanganate ion, , in aqueous solution has an intense purple colour due to an O ‚Üí Mn ligand-to-metal charge transfer band (LMCT) in much of the visible region.Housecroft C. E. and Sharpe A. G. Inorganic Chemistry (2nd ed., Pearson Prentice-Hall 2005), p. 612 This band shows a progression in the symmetric Mn-O stretching vibration. The individual lines overlap each other extensively, giving rise to a broad overall profile with some coarse structure. Progressions in vibrations which are not totally symmetric may also be observed.Hollas, p. 245. d-d electronic transitions in atoms in a centrosymmetric environment are electric-dipole forbidden by the Laporte rule. This will apply to octahedral coordination compounds of the transition metals. The spectra of many of these complexes have some vibronic character. The same rule also applies to f-f transitions in centrosymmetric complexes of lanthanides and actinides. In the case of the octahedral actinide chloro-complex of uranium(IV), UCl62‚àí the observed electronic spectrum is entirely vibronic. At the temperature of liquid helium, 4K, the vibronic structure was completely resolved, with zero intensity for the purely electronic transition, and three side-lines corresponding to the asymmetric U-Cl stretching vibration and two asymmetric Cl-U-Cl bending modes. Later studies on the same anion were also able to account for vibronic transitions involving low-frequency lattice vibrations.

It covers standards and authorisation for rolling stock; workforce skills; independent management of infrastructure; and the liberalisation of domestic passenger services in an attempt to reduce European rail subsidies. Background The fourth railway package attempts to reform railways companies (whether private or public) that are able to raise prices if they dominate both tracks and the trains. Because of scepticism in most countries about the value of liberalisation, the package permits tracks and trains to be owned by a single holding company. The \\"compliance verification clause\\" could allow regulators to place sanctions on parts of a vertically integrated rail business which place obstacles in the way of competitors trying to provide services on their network; this would improve competition. Responsibility for authorising rolling stock to use a network would be shifted away from network owners and towards the European Railway Agency. This is expected to be faster and cheaper.

It is one of a pair of cottages built in the 1840s, from School Lane in Himley. The pair of cottages from School Lane in Himley originally operated as a corner shop. The setting of the display was designed to represent a small scale business. The shop takes its name from a well known Black Country pawnbroker, Joseph Wiltshire, who owned shops in Great Bridge, Wolverhampton and Carter's Green in West Bromwich. The exhibition combines pawnbroking with retail, as did many pawnbroking businesses in the 19th century. In the museum's reconstruction the unredeemed goods and other stock are sold in the front room, while pawning of goods was done in the 'pledge room' at the back. The shop window of the Pawnbroker's gives an example of the types of goods that customers would 'pledge'. The display includes shoes, clothes, furs, musical instruments, children's toys and a set of false teeth. Historical context Window of pawnbrokers shop at Black Country Living Museum Pawnshops prospered in areas where the wages were low and unstable. In the Black Country in 1870 there were 160 pawnbrokers in the area, Walsall had 15 and Wednesbury had 48.Wilkinson, John A. 'Pawnbroking in the Black Country'. Black Country Living Museum, 1991, p.15. For a housewife with a large family to look after it was a constant struggle to make ends meet. It was not uncommon for a family to have linen or clothes that they would pawn as a bridging loan until next payday. The struggling family could pawn their goods on a Monday and could buy them back the following Friday or Saturday.Wilkinson, John A. 'Pawnbroking in the Black Country'. Black Country Living Museum, 1991, p.15. The items pawned were taken as security for a loan, the value of the item was based on what the pawnbroker thought he would get if he sold the item on. In return the customer would receive the loan a ticket. To redeem their pledge the customer had to pay the loan back in full plus any charges this included the valuation of their items and the cost of the ticket. Pawnbrokers in the Black Country needed to be where the people were. Some of these businesses started in public houses, which were frequently visited and saved customers a trip into town.Wilkinson, John A. 'Pawnbroking in the Black Country'. Black Country Living Museum, 1991, p.16. Other Pawnbrokers operated out of converted houses in prominent positions like corner shops.

He helped design the Hawker Fury biplane, the Hurricane monoplane, and the Harrier jump-jet. He graduated with a degree in engineering from London University and retired in the 1960s.  Early life  Chaplin was educated at Tiffin Boys School, Kingston upon Thames. He studied engineering at London University. The First World War interrupted his studies, when he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, serving in France and Belgium until 1919. Chaplin was then obliged to repeat his second year at London University, graduating with an honours degree in engineering (BSc) in 1921. In 1922, Chaplin started his first job,at pump manufacturer Gwynnes of Hammersmith.  Hawker  Chaplin worked on the Hawker Fury. This No. 43 Squadron RAF example c. 1931 In 1926, Chaplin joined Hawker Aircraft at Kingston, when it had fewer than forty design staff. Chaplin worked on the Hawker Fury biplane design. He recalled that, in 1933, many Air Ministry diehards believed that the monoplane structure was unsuitable and dangerous for use as a military aircraft. Hawker's developed the idea of a monoplane version of the Fury biplane fighter with other refinements, such as an enclosed cockpit. Chaplin played a role in the 1934 development of the 'Hawker Fury Monoplane', which became the 'Hurricane'. The Hurricane prototype first flew from Brooklands on 6 November 1935. Chaplin's contributions to the design of the Hurricane were rewarded in 1946 with an OBE. Pre-production version at Brooklands, 6 November 1935By March 1936, test flying of the prototype was completed. The Hawker Board issued instructions planning, jigging, and tooling for the production of one thousand aircraft. The official contract followed three months later. According to Chaplin, \\"The Hurricane brought down more enemy aircraft in the Battle of Britain than all the Spitfires, Blenheims, Defiants, and ground defences put together.\\" In 1939, Chaplin was promoted to assistant chief designer. Ralph Hooper recalled during an interview with Thomas Lean in 2010 that \\"Sydney Camm used to reduce his secretaries to tears from time to time and Roy Chaplin who was his number two used to come in and cheer them up again\\". In 1940, Chaplin and most of the Hawker Design Office moved down the Portsmouth Road from Kingston to Claremont, an 18th-century mansion at Esher. From 1937 until after the Second World War, he was involved with the design of the Typhoon, Tempest and Sea Fury aircraft. In 1946 Chaplin's role in the design and development of the Hurricane was acknowledged when he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.  Jets  Harrier jump-jet (P.1127). Less than twenty years after Chaplin joined Hawker's, the company moved into the jet era when work was started on the P.1040 in 1944. The 1957 Defence White Paper contained the pronouncement that the defence of the country would in the future be achieved with guided weapons, rather than piloted fighters. Hawker's were then proceeding with a private venture design of a Mach 2+ fighter designated P.1121. The cancellation of the P.1121 led to increased emphasis on another project which soon became the P.1127. In 1957, Chaplin became chief designer and in 1959 an executive director on the Hawker Board. That year an order for two prototypes of the P.1127 was placed, with first flights of this revolutionary machine in 1960. It was eventually developed into the operational Harrier jump-jet which was notable for its role in the Falklands conflict. In 1960, the Royal Aeronautical Society awarded Chaplin its Silver Medal \\"for his achievements in the design and development of military aircraft\\". In mid-1961 Chaplin suffered a heart attack; he retired in 1962.  Retirement  Hawker's had full UK government support for the supersonic vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) P.1154 while its competitor, the British Aircraft Corporation, was building the TSR2. In 1965, Harold Wilson's government realised that the country could afford neither of these aircraft, and abruptly cancelled them. The 1982 Falklands conflict might not have been won by Britain but for the Harrier, in the opinion of Admiral of the fleet Terence Lewin, Baron Lewin. Libby Fawbert interviewed Chaplin in his quiet Wiltshire home for PM on BBC Radio 4. 1985 was the fiftieth anniversary of the first flight of the Hurricane. The Royal Aeronautical Society organised a Hurricane Golden Jubilee symposium. At eighty-seven years old, Chaplin was the oldest of four speakers who had worked on the design of the aircraft. Chaplin died on 13 December 1988 at age 89. A Harrier jump-jet flew over the village church in tribute, at the end of his memorial service.

To Katzir's right is Shmuel Sever, Library Director, and to his left Eliezer Refaeli, University President. The librarians are Rina Irmai (left) and Sarah Spiegel (right). The Library's location has changed over the years since it first opened in 1963, in the High School in Edelstein House on Y.L. Peretz Street in the Hadar HaCarmel neighborhood. In the mid-1960s the Library ‚Äì in the framework of the University Institute of Haifa - moved to a new location in the Haifa city school ‚ÄúIroni Heh‚Äù, on Bikurim Street in Hadar HaCarmel. From 1969 until summer 1973 the Library was temporarily transferred to the upper floor of the Multi-Purpose Building on the new University campus. In the early 1970s, construction of the Library in its current location commenced, as part of the project for establishing the University, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. In keeping with the architect's conception of a ‚Äúuniversity under one roof,‚Äù the Library was founded as a central library serving all the faculties, constituting an academic center where people from varied disciplines would interact for mutual enrichment. Professor Shmuel Sever,Sever, Shmuel. Establishment and Management of the University of Haifa Library, 1969-2000 : Personal Summary. Haifa, [n.p.] 2000 (In Hebrew) the Library's director at the time, devoted several months to planning a modern, large library that would serve well into the future. Architect Shlomo Gilad translated his concepts and vision into architectural plans. Oscar Niemeyer designed the building in which the Library is located in the style of ‚ÄúBrutalistic architecture,‚Äù characterized by building with bare concrete in both simple and compound forms to create broad, open spaces that facilitate interior division and future expansion. This approach was common between the 1950s and mid-1980s, due to the influence of Le Corbusier. The planning and construction work continued several years, and as luck would have it, concluded just at the unexpected outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. Despite the constraints and the lack of male workers for putting up shelves, maintenance and carrying loads, Shmuel Sever requested that the Library move to its new quarters as scheduled. And in fact, after detailed planning and despite the severe shortage of workers, librarians and books alike were transferred to the new location. Readers could now make use of a large, high-ceilinged reading room (which was said to be, at the time, the largest in the Middle East), whose eastern fa√ßade was composed entirely of windows facing onto the splendid view of Haifa Bay. The reading room itself held tens of work tables and chairs, the angle of whose backrests had been selected from several models by a poll of readers. The books themselves were housed in galleries on the Library's four levels. Broad corridors, stretching from east to west in the building, ensured maximal illumination. An explicit order from architect Gilad forbade closing these corridors, lest the daylight be blocked. New, brown carpets added warmth to the Library, and wood paneling on shelves and walls softened their grayish color. It seemed, at the time, that the bookshelves would last forever, that the Library had no boundaries, and was destined to serve its patrons for many years. In fact, the Library that Niemeyer designed fulfilled its purpose for over thirty years. But at the beginning of the 21st century, the Library found itself too small and outdated to accommodate its growing collections and the advanced services and technologies it provided. It was not equipped to respond to changing research and teaching needs and its patrons' expectations of an inviting, friendly environment. Baruch Kipnis, director of the Library from 2001‚Äì2005, initiated the idea of expanding and renovating the Library according to the planning principles that he set forth and the architectural program that he prepared along with the Library staff. His persuasive efforts succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the University's administration to support the idea of expansion and renovation. In 2002, an architectural competition took place based on the principles and program that had been formulated. Architect Asaf Lerman was selected to carry out the planning and supervise the construction of a new wing. The project of erecting the building received impetus following receipt of a generous donation from the Nazarian family [see below]. Library director Oren Weinberg oversaw the construction work until its completion. Lerman selected fashionable materials such as bare concrete, glass and wood, and planned the new wing in a neo-modernistic spirit, creating a successful dialog with the old wing built in the modernistic style of Niemeyer. Construction was completed in 2010. For his planning of the new wing, Architect Lerman was selected as one of five finalists for the 2010 Rechter Prize in architecture. Renovation of the original library wing, including reorganization of the Library entrance, interior spaces, study corners, a central service area and circulation desks, was completed in June 2012. Expansion, 2007‚Äì2012 Entrance and patio, south wing 2012. In 2007, Soraya and Younes Nazarian, leading members of the community of expatriate Iranian Jews in Los Angeles, made a generous donation to the University for the purpose of renovating and expanding the Library, including construction of a new wing. The Nazarians are known for their philanthropic activities on behalf of the community in a variety of fields, including the arts, health and the development of institutions of higher education in the United States and Israel. The couple donates to educational institutions in Israel out of a conviction that education is essential for Israel's future. They believe that investment in education will improve not only the personal condition of each citizen, but also the economic situation of the whole nation. In June 2007, Younes Nazarian received an honorary doctorate during the meeting of the University's Board of Governors, in recognition of his donation and commitment to the State of Israel and to Jews the world over. The dedication ceremony for the new wing, officially named the Southern Wing, took place on 31 May 2011, at which time the Library was renamed the Younes and Soraya Nazarian Library, University of Haifa. On 3 June 2012, during the 40th annual meeting of the University's Board of Governors and in the presence of the donors, an additional festive dedication ceremony was held to mark the conclusion of the Library renovation. Technological development Traditional card catalog From the time the Library opened in the early 1960s, it has developed in keeping with changes in the technological environment. A central change was the transition from use of the Dewey Decimal classification system to that of the Library of Congress, which was at the time unknown in Israel. This transition was led by Elhanan Adler and Aviva Shichor Adler, Elhanan and Shichor, Aviva. Cataloging : Fundamentals and Rules. Jerusalem: Center for Public Libraries in Israel, 1995.(In Hebrew) Additional milestones were the computer revolution that the Library underwent from the end of the 1970s and the introduction of the Internet at the beginning of the 1990s. Technological developments influenced the means of storing information, the Library catalog and databases on the one hand, and retrieval of information, on the other. The many transformations in the professional work of librarians and information specialists and in the use of the Library and its resources included remote access to the Library catalog and bibliographic databases, electronic periodicals and books, and remote reference services (by means of telephone, email and WhatsApp). The influence of technological advancement is evident throughout the Library. The traditional card catalog was replaced in the 1980s by a computerized catalog, which itself evolved over years and became accessible via the Internet. Access to many databases was transformed from a local CD network to online formats. Most periodicals were converted to digital format, accessible from anywhere at any time. Collections of slides, photographs and products of University research were scanned and merged into the Digital Media Center. Over time, electronic books constitute an ever-larger proportion of the Library's collection. A unique project of the Library is the Index to Hebrew Periodicals, a multi-disciplinary tool that provides users access to academic articles as well as business and popular ones. The Index contains citations to hundreds of thousands of articles from selected periodicals, collections and daily newspapers in many fields: Judaica, literature, education, history, archeology, the arts, architecture, medicine, law, agriculture, nature, science, technology, society and the nation. Since its inception in 1977, the indexing project was transformed over the years from a printed format to a computerized one, and was eventually incorporated into the Library services available via the Internet. Since 2009 the Library's online services were unified under the OneSearch portal ‚Äì based on the Primo system ‚Äì which provides a single entry point to all the Library's resources. The Library was the first in Israel to adopt Primo and to develop and integrate the Hebrew interface (including graphic design and text display), based on usability testing. Library Assessment Activities Since 2007, the Library has regularly carried out Library assessment activities aimed at determining the quality of its services based on user feedback via satisfaction surveys, Wayfinding, Usability and Focus Groups. These surveys examined: the physical environment, services, user needs, the collection, and user interfaces both within the Library and via remote access. Once every three years the Library conducts a LibQUAL user satisfaction survey. LibQUAL, established and managed by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in the United States, is an international survey that has been carried out in more than 1000 academic libraries worldwide.

With a half- century of appearances for his county, he played for Donegal in two All- Ireland senior finals. A fixture in the Donegal teams of the Jim McGuinness era, Molloy won an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 2012 and three Ulster Senior Football Championships, in 2011, 2012 and 2014. Early life He was educated at St Eunan's College in Letterkenny. As a ten-year-old he wrote in a scrapbook of his wish to play for Donegal and win an All-Ireland medal. Playing career =Club= Molloy has had great success with his club Naomh Conaill, winning Championships at under-age level and then the Donegal Senior Football Championship. He first encountered McGuinness while with his club and first played under him in 2009, a year in which reached the final of the Donegal Senior Football Championship but lost. He captained the Naomh Conaill team that won the Under-21 Football Championship in 2012. He also played in five consecutive Under-21 Football Championship Finals, winning three from those five. Molloy scored 1‚Äì4 (including one free) for his club in the final of the 2010 Donegal Senior Football Championship. He then finished top scorer overall in the 2010 Ulster Senior Club Football Championship when they reached the final against Crossmaglen Rangers but narrowly missed out on winning the club's first Ulster Football Championship title. He played for his club in the final of the 2015 Donegal Senior Football Championship. They won. =Inter-county= Minor Molloy played minor inter-county football for Donegal in 2008 and 2009. Under-21 Molloy played for the under-21 footballers in 2010, 2011 and 2012, and captained the team in 2012. He played for Donegal in the 2010 Ulster Under-21 Football Championship campaign, contributing six points (including three frees) to the team's three-point quarter-final victory over Armagh, three points (all frees) to the team's four-point semi-final victory over Derry and to the team's comprehensive final victory over Cavan, with all three games played at neutral Brewster Park. He then played in the final of the 2010 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship, which Donegal (managed by Jim McGuinness) narrowly lost to Dublin (managed by Jim Gavin), though Molloy scored five points (including four frees). Senior Following the 2010 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship final loss, and while returning home to Galway (where he lived with Leo McLoone at the time), Molloy received word that he had been called into the senior county team. Molloy made his senior inter-county debut against Down in the 2010 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter-final as a 19-year-old. He scored 1‚Äì3 on the day. He was then cited a week later for an incident with Down player Damian Rafferty with a leading elbow. He thus missed Donegal's 2010 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier match against Armagh in Crossmaglen. Molloy scored a late goal in the 2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship semi-final victory over Tyrone in Clones. He was a member of the Donegal panel that won the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final against Mayo, coming on as a substitute for Martin McElhinney in injury time in the second half. Molloy started Rory Gallagher's first match in charge of the county, a 2015 Dr McKenna Cup away defeat to Derry. He left the team later that month, ahead of the start of the 2015 National Football League.

The most senior match official is the referee, they may be assisted by a range of other officials depending on the level and rules of the competition. Equipment The match officials may use the following equipment: ;Coin :The referee organises a coin toss with the team captains to decide who taps off and what end each team takes initially. ;Whistle :Referees must carry a whistle to stop play and then signal to players about many things during a game. A referee will let players know when to stop after foul play or while awarding a touchdown and at other times in a game. Uniform All referees wear an official uniform of a colour (generally white) distinguishable from those being worn by the two sides playing each other. Referees wear a coloured badge to indicate which level of accreditation they have achieved. Accreditation Referees must first pass refereeing exams set by their national governing body before officiating at progressively more senior levels of the sport, gaining experience in lower-level competitions and then moving onto higher-level competitions where they will progress to the top if good enough. =Levels= Referees are accredited according to a numbered level system, with Level 1 generally being the lowest, introductory, level. The number of levels as well as badge colours, shapes and sizes differ depending on the governing body. Touch Football Australia operates under a six-level structure while Touch NZ uses a four-level system and Touch Europe uses five. Gold Badge The Gold Badge is the most distinguished badge that can be awarded to a referee and is awarded by the Federation of International Touch. At present, they are awarded to the ten highest ranked referees at the Touch Football World Cup, which is held every four years. Refereeing systems Different refereeing systems are in use: ;Single Referee :One referee officiates the match, without the help of sideline officials. The single-referee system is usually only used in park-level/social competition where the availability of referees is low. ;Dual Referee :Two referees control the match and alternate between the role of central referee and sideline official. The dual-referee system is used only in park-level/social competition where the availability of referees is low. ;Triple Referee :Three referees control the match in a similar way to the dual-referee system, with one central referee and a sideline official on each sideline. The triple-referee system is the standard system and is required at all representative levels of the game. Positions and responsibilities =Player safety= Referees are to inspect player uniforms, playing boots, jewellery and fingernails to ensure player safety. =Tap-off and direction= The referees organises a coin toss with the captains of the two teams playing to decide which team taps off and which end they play at from tap-off. =Area of control= Referees have control over all players and team officials participating in the match, including substitute players. A referee's area of control extends to a general radius of 10 metres from the edge of the field. =Referee's signals= The referee uses signals to communicate his/her decisions with the players, team officials and spectators. =Central Referee and Sideline Officials= Generally, matches are controlled by three referees, alternating between the role of central referee and sideline official. The central referee controls play and makes all decisions. Sideline officials are responsible for controlling substituting players, advising the referee of forward passes (through discreet signals), and assisting the central referee in controlling onside defenders. Only the central referee uses his/her whistle.

This test is based on imitation of coagulation processes occurring in vivo, is sensitive both to pro- and anticoagulant changes in the hemostatic balance. Highly sensitive to thrombosis. The method was developed in the Physical Biochemistry Laboratory under the direction of Prof. Fazly Ataullakhanov. Technology description Thrombodynamics analyser scheme Thrombodynamics designed to investigate the in vitro spatial-temporal dynamics of blood coagulation initiated by localized coagulation activator under conditions similar to the conditions of the blood clotting in vivo. Thrombodynamics takes into account the spatial heterogeneity trombodinamiki processes in blood coagulation. The test is performed without mixing in a thin layer of plasma. The measurement cuvette with the blood plasma sample is placed inside the water thermostat. Clotting starts when activator with immobilized TF is immersed into the cuvette. The clot then propagates from the activating surface into the bulk of plasma. Image of growing clot is registered via the CCD camera using a time-lapse microscopy mode in scattered light and then parameters of coagulation are calculated on the computer. Thrombodynamics analyser T-2 device also supports measurement of spatial dynamics of thrombin propagation during the process of clot growth via usage of the fluorogenic substrate for thrombin. Blood plasma sample is periodically irradiated with the excitation light and the emission of the fluorophore is registered by CCD camera. Mathematical methods are used to restore spatio- temporal distribution of the thrombin from the fluorophore signal. This experimental model worked well in research and has demonstrated good sensitivity to various disorders of the coagulation system. Features *Observing spatial growth of fibrin clots in vitro *Measuring thrombin generation as a function of space and time during thrombus formation *Time- and space- resolved imaging of other active coagulation factors *High sensitivity to both pro- and anticoagulant changes in the hemostatic balance Applications *Prothrombotic disorders *Hypercoagulation in the perioperative period, DIC, cancer patients, patients with thrombotic risk factors Diagnostics of coagulopathy Monitoring of anticoagulant therapy Individual therapy planning *Bleeding disorders Hemophilia A and B, DIC, blood loss, anticoagulant overdose Diagnostics of coagulopathy Monitoring of replacement therapy *Identification of coagulopathy pathogenesis *Development of drugs and biomaterials See also *Blood coagulation References Category:Blood tests Category:Mathematics in medicine ","title":"Thrombodynamics test"},{"id":"38382622","text":"Scopula xanthocephalata is a moth of the family Geometridae.

It was written in 1937 and first published in book form in MacNeice's poetry collection The Earth Compels (1938). The poem reflects on MacNeice's childhood in Carrickfergus, a large town in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Although the title of the poem is \\"Carrickfergus\\", the text of the poem refers to \\"Carrick\\", as the town is known locally and colloquially. Background Louis MacNeice was born in 1907 in Belfast, as he notes in the opening lines of \\"Carrickfergus\\": 'Gantries' refers to the Harland and Wolff shipyard, and the Arrol Gantry which dominated the skyline. This was constructed just after MacNiece's birth but was well-known within a few years as the building place of . The 'mountain' is the Black Mountain, which forms a backdrop to inland Belfast. In November 1908 Louis MacNeice's father, John MacNeice, was appointed Rector of St Nicholas' Church, Carrickfergus, and in January 1909 the family moved to Carrickfergus, a town ten miles from Belfast on the northern shore of Belfast Lough: The MacNeices lived first in a house at 5 Governor's Walk, facing the harbour. \\"Its front door opened on the street, the farther side of which was flanked by the harbour wall, so that in rough weather spray would lash the windows. The rector liked its closeness to the sea as well as to the historic castle (a stone's throw to the left) and to his church.\\" Jon Stallworthy: Louis MacNeice. London: Faber and Faber, 1995. Paperback edition 1996, p. 20. In early 1911 the MacNeices moved into Carrickfergus Rectory, a large house with a garden, \\"far from the dirt and noise of the harbour, on the other side of town.\\" Jon Stallworthy: Louis MacNeice, p. 22. Here Louis MacNeice spent his childhood until, at the age of ten, he began at Sherborne Preparatory School, Dorset: In \\"Carrickfergus\\", Louis MacNeice reflects on his childhood growing up in Carrickfergus. One stanza describes his position as the son of John MacNeice ‚Äì \\"I was the rector's son, born to the anglican order\\" ‚Äì and mentions the Chichester Monument, an elaborate marble monument in St Nicholas' Church which made a deep impression on the young Louis MacNeice. He would later include a description of the Chichester Monument in his unfinished autobiography, The Strings are False: \\"a huge Elizabethan monument to the Chichester family who had then been the power in the land.\\" Louis MacNeice: The Strings are False: An Unfinished Autobiography, ed. E. R. Dodds (London, 1965). \\"Carrickfergus\\" also describes a wartime childhood, with rationing and \\"maps above the fireplace\\", and a \\"huge camp of soldiers\\" in sight of Carrickfergus Rectory. Structure \\"Carrickfergus\\" is a poem of eleven stanzas, each of four lines. The second and fourth lines of each stanza rhyme. (The sixth stanza has the same word, \\"long\\", at the end of the second and fourth line.) MacNeice makes use of poetic devices such as assonance ‚Äì \\"the clang of trams\\" ‚Äì and alliteration ‚Äì \\"sweat and khaki in the Carlisle train\\".

Description Glenormiston is located about west of Boulia and north of Birdsville in Central West Queensland. Located at the top of the Channel Country the property shares a boundary with Marion Downs Station. The Georgina River flows through the north eastern part of the property as it journeys southward further into the channel country. The station occupies an area of and encompasses a variety of country from the Toko Range to the west to the floodplains to the east. The land on the property is described as being composed of open and broken downs, with river and creek flats, low limestone ridges, inferior flats and rough hills. An assessing commissioner also noted that it is light carrying country, safe if not over-stocked and is excellent country for raising an fattening heavy cattle. History The Wongkadjera were one of the tribes local to this area and aborigines once traded Pituri north along the Georgina River into Wangka-yutyurru country and south along the Mulligan River to the Lake Eyre system. The creek near the homestead is named Pituri Creek and it flows into Lake Idamea. J.A. Coglan lived in the homestead in the 1890s. The station was established in 1877 along with several other well known properties in the Channel Country as pastoralists expanded westward from the grasslands at the headwaters of the Diamantina. Other properties established at the same time included Marion Downs Station, Headingly Station, Herbert Downs, Noranside and Roxburgh Downs. The station was put up for auction in 1881 by its owner, Walter Douglas. At this time the station was in area and was stocked with a herd of 3000 highly bred Durham cattle and Hereford cattle, some horses, all plant, stores and stock. The lands were described as open rolling downs with saltbush and cotton bush, thickly grassed with Mitchell grass and other varieties. Interspersed with open patches of gidyah, mulga and other timbers. Later the same year an unfortunate cook, who had only taken up the position a couple of days earlier, was killed by Aborigines in the area. The station was successfully sold at auction to Mr William Kelman. Flooding occurred at the station in 1885 when somewhere between and of rain fell over the course of a month. The Georgina River and the Diamatina Rivers both were flooded and the nearby Sandringham station was submerged. At some point prior to 1890 the station changed hands and the new owner was James Tyson who owned several other stations including Tupra, Mooroonowa, Juanbung and Bangate in New South Wales and Meteor Downs, Albinia, Mount Russell and Tinnenburra in Queensland. The property was stocked with 25,000 cattle in 1890. In 1893 the region was struck by a terrible drought and the station would be thought to be lucky to be able to muster 10,000 cattle, with carcasses laying all over the property. Drought struck again in 1897 but to a lesser extent. Tyson died in 1898, Glenormiston was stocked with about 10,048 cattle and 220 horses at this time. When the station was advertised for sale in 1899 it had an area of and as adjoining Herbert Downs and Roxborough Downs stations. The station sold later that year to Collins, White and Co. along with Carnarvon and Babiloora Stations in the Warrego district. Rabbits were first seen at the station in the late 1890s with at least one permanent colony known to be located near Toco lake on the station which was the furthest north that the rabbit had ventured in 1899. A meteorite, known as the Glenormiston meteorite, was found on the station by the manager Mr F. H. Story, in 1925. Story sold the object to the University of Queensland in 1926. The meteorite had a mass of , has an irregular sub- triangular shape with convex and concave surfaces. The area was struck by drought in 1952. In 1955 the property was completely cut off by floodwaters. A Trans Australia Airlines aeroplane was chartered to do an airdrop of food to the property which had been without fresh food for a week. The North Australian Pastoral Company acquired Glenormiston in 1968. The adjoining property, Marion Downs, was acquired at about the same time. Stephen and Narda Bryce moved to the property in 2001 and Stephen was still managing the property and about ten staff in 2012. The property has a carrying capacity of about 7000 head of cattle depending on the season. Moderate flooding was experienced at Glenormiston in 2010 following heavy rains locally and further north in the Georgina catchment.

Working closely with government departments the UKPSF has clarified several laws relating to paintball in the UK, one policy that was clarified was the \\"Anti Social Behaviour Act 2003. The UKPSF has also created guidelines for subjects such as HPA system safety, correct paintball goggle/mask use, correct use of barrel \\"plugs\\" \\"socks\\" \\"bungs\\" or \\"condoms\\" and importantly \\"buying and selling paintball guns in the UK\\" all of which work inside all known government legislation. These practices should be enforced so that the safety aspect of paintballing in the UK is not compromised. In extreme cases, accidents or injuries that go to court to be settled could lead to full investigation of the paintball industry, this could damaging the paintball industry irreparably leading to higher insurance costs, and new government legislation restricting paintball in the UK. The UKPSF work to raise awareness of the risks, and to protect the paintball industry.  UKPSF Site Accreditation scheme  This Accreditation means that Parents, Schools and government services can be assured that venues have met the high standards of health and safety expected from a UKPSF Accredited venue. Individual membership The UKPSF also run a personal membership for paintball players, membership covers the players insurance for playing paintball at any UKPSF accredited venue. They ensure the safety of paintball players at all levels, from an occasional player, or a fully sponsored Professional paintballer. Full membership covers you under the UKPSF insurance at all \\"UKPSF accredited venues\\" or \\"UKPSF Affiliated Events\\", however public liability insurance already covers you in the even of any injury or mishap. One of the UKPSF's goals is to get paintball as a recognised sport in the UK, to send the application to the UK Sports Council the UKPSF need a minimum of 1800 \\"active\\" members, as well as being able to check off a huge list of criteria set out by the UK sports council. Legal Status The UKPSF is not a legally accredited organisation and despite claims of liaising with The Home Office to aid in legal matters, The Home Office does not recognise them as such and uses internal experts to clarify controversial elements such as frangible ammunition and replica firearms laws. Controversy The UKPSF is often subject within the UK paintball community to heavy criticism, this is due to the fact that despite its claims as being the governing and legal body of UK paintball, it holds no such position. The largest criticism of the group is its offer of insurance among any UKPSF affiliated site; this is misleading in that it falsely leads to the belief that UKPSF membership is the only way to insure and protect both the customers and the site owners; in fact among UK law customers are covered by Public Liability Insurance and owners are covered by legal waivers. Larger criticism comes from the organisations make-up, made up of large names and groups in the industry including product makers and large site owners, meaning there is legal group for the group to be classed as a business cartel, something that is legally grey under UK law. The group has little popular support within UK paintball and has yet to meet its membership requirement of 1800.

It was discovered on 25 August 2008 by astronomers at the Andrushivka Astronomical Observatory in northern Ukraine. The asteroid was named after the online encyclopedia Wikipedia in January 2013.  Nomenclature  The decision of the Committee for Small Body Nomenclature to assign the name \\"Wikipedia\\" to the asteroid was published in the Minor Planet Circulars on 27 January 2013 (). The asteroid received the number . The name was proposed by Andriy Makukha, a board member of Wikimedia Ukraine. It was submitted to the Committee by the owner of the observatory, Yuri Ivashchenko. It reads:  Characteristics  Wikipedia is a member of the Vesta family (), one of the most numerous asteroid families in the asteroid belt. It is located in the proximity of 21791 Mattweegman, one of the family's principal members. Vestian asteroids have a composition akin to cumulate eucrites (HED meteorites). They are thought to have originated deep within Vesta's crust, possibly from the Rheasilvia crater, a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere which formed as the result of a subcatastrophic collision. Wikipedia orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of once every 3 years and 8 months (1,342 days; semi-major axis of 2.38 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins almost 11 years prior to its official discovery, with its first observation being by the ODAS survey in September 1997.  Observation  Wikipedia was discovered by astronomers from the Andrushivka Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine, the country's only privately owned observatory, which has discovered nearly 90 asteroids since 2003. It was first observed by the Andrushivka team on 25 August 2008 at 22:47 UTC. It was also observed on the next night and it received provisional designation . After it was also observed on 6 September by the Andrushivka team, the orbit of the asteroid was calculated accurately. It was shown that the asteroid was the same as and previously spotted by observatories Caussols-ODAS (France), Mount Lemmon Survey and Steward Observatory (both in Arizona, U.S.).

A stadium is a two-dimensional geometric shape constructed of a rectangle with semicircles at a pair of opposite sides. The same shape is known also as a discorectangle, obround, or sausage body. The shape is based on a stadium, a place used for athletics and horse racing tracks. A stadium may be constructed as the Minkowski sum of a disk and a line segment. Alternatively, it is the neighborhood of points within a given distance from a line segment. A stadium is a type of oval. However, unlike some other ovals such as the ellipses, it is not an algebraic curve because different parts of its boundary are defined by different equations.  Formulas  The perimeter of a stadium is calculated by the formula P = 2 (\\\\pi r+a) where a is the length of the straight sides and r is the radius of the semicircles. With the same parameters, the area of the stadium is A = \\\\pi r^2 + 2ra = r(\\\\pi r + 2a). Bunimovich stadium When this shape is used in the study of dynamical billiards, it is called the Bunimovich stadium. Leonid Bunimovich used this shape to show that it is possible for billiard tracks to exhibit chaotic behavior (positive Lyapunov exponent and exponential divergence of paths) even within a convex billiard table. Related shapes A capsule is produced by revolving a stadium around the line of symmetry that bisects the semicircles.

The house consists of a main 3-storey block with set back pavilions at each end. The main block is built of sandstone ashlar with 5 bays on three sides, a hipped slate roof and a central Ionic entrance portico. It has 15 bedrooms and 4 reception rooms. History The Quernmore Park estate was sold by the Crown to Roger Downes of Wardley in 1630, passed c.1675 to Sir Thomas Preston of Furness and then passed by marriage to Hugh Clifford, 2nd Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. It descended through the Clifford family until it was sold in 1794 to Charles Gibson of Preston. The present house was probably built by Thomas Harrison of Chester in 1795‚Äì1798, when the estate covered some 1900 acres (770 ha), which Gibson completely reorganised, creating new farms and fields. He died in 1823, after which it transferred to his son, also Charles, High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1827, who died soon after him in 1832. Charles Gibson senior's wife continued to live at the house after the death of her son. In c.1842 the house was acquired by William James Garnett (1818‚Äì1873), a prosperous cotton merchant of Lark Hill, Salford, conditional on the widow Gibson remaining in residence until her death, which occurred in 1843. He then commissioned Alexander Mills to remodel the frontage (adding the portico) and the interior entrance hall. He served as MP for Lancaster from 1857 to 1864. It then passed down to his son, also William Garnett (1852‚Äì1929), who was a Justice of the Peace (J.P.), Deputy-Lieutenant and appointed High Sheriff for 1879 and then in turn to his son, diplomat William James Garnett (1878‚Äì1965), who was High Sheriff for 1937 and 1941. On his death the property devolved to his younger brother Noel Trevor Garnett, an overseas civil servant, and then on the latter's death in 1961 to his son William Francis Garnett. The estate was sold in 1990 by William Francis to the Oldroyd family. The estate was for sale in 2012, with the house itself in 20 acres of grounds, for ¬£2.5m.

The estate of the family was Csengerbagos (today: Boghi»ô, Romania). They were received the right of blood court by Louis I of Hungary in 1354. Later Sigismund confirmed their jurisdictional privileges along with the Vet√©si family in 1409. The Diet of Szatm√°ry Country were held several times (e. g. 1306 and 1718) in Csengerbagos.

The first of this kind was the title naming issue, where the Hindu Makkal Katchi party demanded the change from its current Sanskrit title to a purely Tamil one. When Kamal Haasan announced a direct-to-home (DTH) premiere of the film, theatre owners demanded a rollback of this plan, as they feared major revenue losses to DTH companies. Threatened by a complete theatre boycott of Vishwaroopam, Haasan agreed to release the film first in theatres. Later, Muslim groups in Tamil Nadu demanded the ban of the film and claimed, that the film would hurt Muslim sentiments. Although the film was cleared by Central Board of Film Certification of India, district collectors in the state of Tamil Nadu gave orders to the theatre owners to not show Vishwaroopam, citing law and order problems, however the film released in other states with greater Muslim populations than in Tamil Nadu. The ban in Tamil Nadu triggered the stop of screenings in neighbouring Indian states as well as a few foreign markets. The film fraternity of India condemned the actions instructed by Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalitha as a critical attack on freedom of speech in India, but she denied all allegations against her regarding political and business interests. After persistent pressure to cut the film by allegedly objectionable scenes, Kamal Haasan said, he could be forced to leave the state of Tamil Nadu and India, because he was \\"fed up at being played around in a dirty political game\\". He estimated the loss of revenues, due to banning policies, somewhere between 300‚Äì600 million. A mutual agreement with the Muslims of Tamil Nadu was finally settled on 2 February 2013, when Haasan accepted to mute five scenes.  Title naming  In June 2012, the film ran into trouble with the Hindu Makkal Katchi who demanded that the title be changed. They claimed that Vishwaroopam was a Sanskrit word rather than a Tamil word, and argued that Kamal Haasan was being against his native language - Tamil - by naming the film in another language, citing \\"Kamal Haasan, who has been in the industry for more than half a century must be an example for young film makers to take up Tamil titles for their films.\\" The same political party had earlier protested against the song Kannodu Kannai Kalandhal in Haasan's Manmadhan Ambu (2010), following which it was removed from the film.  Direct-to-home release  Vishwaroopam was about to see its premiere on direct-broadcast satellite, or direct-to-home (DTH), platforms, wherein Haasan had roped in many DTH operators for the simultaneous release on DTH along with the theatrical release. However, it was later reported that the concept would be dropped after the Tamil Nadu theatre organisations protested against such a television release. Reports again emerged that Hasaan is keen on releasing Vishwaroopam on DTH platform, stating \\"If only three percent of population in Tamil Nadu use DTH services, then how much loss can one show of my film possibly cause the producers or theatre owners?\\". He also added that it would be one time show, few hours before the film actually releases in theatres and would approximately cost . Talks with theatre owners ended in a compromise, where the DTH version would be released one week after the theatrical release in Tamil and Telugu and one day after its release in Hindi in North India, on 2 February. However, Haasan filed a complaint at the Competition Commission of India against the Tamil Nadu theatre owners association for \\"anti-competitive practices\\" in restricting the release of Vishwaroopam. The CCI ordered a probe by its investigation arm Director General as there exists a comparable prima facie case.  Islamic protests and banning  Islamic organizations had earlier demanded that the film be screened to them prior to its release, expressing concern over the depiction of the community in the film. Haasan had organized a special screening of the film for them following their demand. However, the screening of the film had been put on hold for 15 days by the government of Tamil Nadu under Section 144 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, due to persistent allegations made by Islamic organisations including the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazagham (TMMK), while negotiations are still in progress. TMMK leader M. H. Jawahirullah claimed, \\"There is a danger that the public may view any Muslim with a beard as a terrorist waiting for an opportunity to plant a bomb\\". Kamal Haasan released a protest note, criticising them for using an \\"icon bashing\\" tactic in order to politically profile themselves. Contrary to Jawahirullah, he also stated, that the movie would be giving Muslims a sense of pride. Haasan took the matter to the Madras High Court, seeking an immediate rollback of the government ban on the basis of approval by the Central Board of Film Certification, however justice K. Venkatraman stayed the screening of Vishwaroopam until 28 January, delaying the release in Tamil Nadu for three days, to review the film. The Madras High Court uphold the ban in Tamil Nadu on 30 January 2013. As a reason was suggested, that the judge was awaiting the result of Haasan's other case against District collectors, who gave orders to ban the film's release. The Andhra Pradesh government stopped the screening in Hyderabad and other areas, where the Milad-un-Nabi festival is celebrated by Muslims, while a precautious stop of screenings was enacted by the distributor in Bangalore in light of Tamil Nadu's ban. Kerala saw an unlimited release of the film, although some Muslim outfits were reportedly arrested by the police of Kerala for disrupting screenings. In Thiruvananthapuram, a group of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) supporters took out a protest demonstration to the theatre complex. The film was later confirmed to release on 26 January in Hyderabad and on 27 January in 25 theatres across Karnataka including 15 in Bangalore. Despite protests Vishwaroopam was screened in Karnataka on 26 January 2013 itself. Screening of the film was disrupted in some parts of Mysore, Bangalore, and Shimoga districts following protests. However, Vishwaroopam was taken off theatres across Karnataka following police advisory. Meanwhile, theatres in Malaysia and Sri Lanka removed the film, citing the ban in Tamil Nadu. The film was released in Uttar Pradesh, where leaders initially reserved a possible ban for the film, without any major incidences. Haasan said that he would file a petition in the Supreme Court to overturn the ban. Haasan expressed grief during a press conference he held at his residence, which he had pawned as part of securing the budget for Vishwaroopam. At the widely broadcast press conference, which numerous film personalities from Tamil cinema had attended in solidarity, he stated his intent of leaving Tamil Nadu for some other secular state in India. Kamal Haasan said, \\"I mean no harm. The film is not about hurting Muslims. The good Muslims in the films are Indians and bad Muslims are terrorists who are not from India. How can I paint terrorist...terrorism white.\\" For further talks, the Muslim party demanded a cut of around nine minutes of the film. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa defended the government's action, stating it was not in a position to provide security across all 524 theatres where it was to be screened from 25 January. A mutual agreement was finally settled on 2 February 2013, when Haasan agreed to mute five scenes. The Malaysian government will hold a meeting with distributor of Vishwaroopam to find a solution to lift the ban on it. The National Censorship Board and the Malaysian Islamic Development Department reviewed the film and the Home ministry lifted the ban on 19 February 2013. = Reactions = These developments have been widely criticised by several filmmakers and politicians alike. Backing Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth stated, Leela Samson, chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification, condemned the allegations of the film being anti-Islamic stating that: Shah Rukh Khan, who also faced obstructions during the release of Billu Barber (2009) and My Name is Khan (2010) and whose Red Chillies VFX was responsible for Vishwaroopam's visual effects, expressed sympathies for Haasan's situation, stating that a ban is \\"the most unfortunate thing to happen to a film\\". The banning of Vishwaroopam was deemed \\"unfair\\" by Prakash Raj, who stated that \\"cultural terrorism should stop\\". The film's ban was decried by Ajith Kumar who questioned whether India was \\"a secular nation or being played on the basis of vote bank politics\\". Fellow filmmaker Bharathiraja compared Haasan along the likes of Bharathiyar for his bold statements on social issues in his films. Demonstrating solidarity, Vijay and the crew of Thalaivaa halted filming until the release of Vishwaroopam in Tamil Nadu. Actor-director R. Parthiban stated that \\"people are the best judges and that they should decide on whether the film is against a community or not\\". Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt stated that humiliation of an \\"immaculate actor\\" and \\"national treasure\\" is \\"one of the darkest moments for the entire film fraternity\\". Other individuals who expressed their disapproval of the film's ban include Sushilkumar Shinde, Aamir Khan, Anubhav Sinha, Manoj Bajpayee, Siddharth, R. Madhavan, Dhanush, A. R. Murugadoss, Linguswamy, Ameer Sultan, Muktha Srinivasan, Salman Rushdie, Deepa Mehta, Salman Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Chitrangda Singh, Amitabh Bachchan, Farhan Akhtar, Akshay Kumar, Mahesh Babu, Pawan Kalyan, Anupam Kher, Karan Johar, A. Samad Said, Madhur Bhandarkar, Shabana Azmi, Shyam Benegal and Ketan Mehta. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan mentioned \\"This film glorifies Islam, portraying the Muslim as an upstanding specimen who won‚Äôt think twice before punishing a wrongdoer from his own faith.\\" = Political conflicts = Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M. Karunanidhi alleged that the inactivity of the J. Jayalalitha administration on the film is the result of a wrath over Kamal Haasan who had recently expressed his opinion \\"on wanting to see a dhoti-clad Tamilian\\" for prime minister at a function in Chennai. The comment was made at a function attended by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and Karunanidhi. Karunanidhi accused Jayalalithaa for being involved in a conflict-of-interest; Jaya TV, a television network closely associated with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, had previously placed a bid on the satellite distribution rights for Vishwaroopam, which Haasan declined citing a low offer. Jayalalitha justified the ban to maintain law and order based on intelligence reports and said that there was no political motive behind the move. She also offered support from government to facilitate talks to see the release of the film and said she will sue Karunanidhi and media for maligning her on the issue.  Other issues  Tamil Nadu Brahmin Association (TAMBRAS) filed a complaint with City police commissioner that film contained scenes that offended the community and requested to remove the same. A petition asking for a nationwide ban on screening the film citing some of scenes offending the Christian community was dismissed by the Madras High Court. Director Ameer stated that Vishwaroopam portrayed Talibans as \\"cruel and inhumane\\", while according to him they were actually \\"helpless citizens fighting for the right of their own country\\", an issue which was not debated about. He compared the Talibans to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, saying \\"Just like how Prabhakaran and his associates fought for their Eelam rights, the Taliban fight for their country. And similar to how it is injustice to the Eelam if we were to portray them as raw terrorists, it is equally absurd of Vishwaroopam to have portrayed Taliban as mad destroyers\\".

The company bought three properties in 1939/40 in order to provide holidays for staff and workers during the war. Mottram Hall was bought for the works, a small hotel in Llandudno for the middle level staff and a property in Criccieth for senior staff. Mottram Hall was sold as surplus to requirements by GEC in 1968 and is now a luxury country house hotel. The company was acquired by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in 1928. Following the restructuring of AEI in 1960, Ferguson, Pailin & Co ceased to be a separate subsidiary and was merged into AEI switchgear. Following the takeover of AEI by GEC in 1967, the Higher Openshaw works became part of GEC Switchgear. In 1989, GEC merged its electrical engineering interests with those of Alsthom to form GEC Alsthom. The factory was later closed by Alstom in 2003, with most of the employees finishing on 22 November 2002.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors. It contains a Ras exchange motif, a diacylglycerol-binding domain, and two calcium-binding EF hands. This protein was shown to activate H-Ras in a cation-dependent manner in vitro. Expression of this protein in myeloid cell lines was found to be correlated with elevated level of activated RAS protein, and the RAS activation can be greatly enhanced by phorbol ester treatment, which suggested a role of this protein in diacylglycerol regulated cell signaling pathways. Studies of a mast cell leukemia cell line expressing substantial amounts of abnormal transcripts of this gene indicated that this gene may play an important role in the final stages of mast cell development. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009].

On 18 March 1989, Aidgylara organised the mass gathering at the historical meeting place of Lykhny that demanded from the Soviet leadership the reversal of Abkhazia's 1931 Stalin-era incorporation into Georgia and restoration of full Republic status. In 1989, Aidgylara also started publishing two newspapers, the eponymous Aidgylara and Edineniye, as well as the regional publication Bzyb in Gudauta District. On Aidgylara's initiative, the founding congress of the Assembly of the Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus was held in Sukhumi on 25 and 26 August 1989. Aidgylara's second congress was held on 3 February 1990, it elected Sergei Shamba to succeed Gogua as Chairman, as well as a board of 51 members.

The company's CEO, Douglas Harris, is a former vice president of TNK-BP. The company is a resident of the Energy Efficient Technologies cluster of the Skolkovo Foundation. RRT Global is the first company to implement the conversion of light gasoline fractions in a combined process. History The company was founded in St. Petersburg by chemical engineers Oleg Parputs () and Oleg Giiazov (), who had previously worked in an engineering company that served the oil refining sector. Startup financing was provided by Foresight Ventures, Bright Capital and the Skolkovo Foundation. The first laboratory was established on the campus of the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology. The laboratory was unheated, which meant that researchers had to work there for 6‚Äì8 hours in padded jackets. The company became a resident of the Energy Efficient Technologies cluster of the Skolkovo Foundation in 2011. Douglas Harris, the former Vice President of Refining at BP and TNK-BP, became the company‚Äôs CEO in the same year. The company has patented the PRIS technology in Russia, Europe and the United States. The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, met with the company‚Äôs management team in October 2011, and visited the company‚Äôs laboratory in September 2012 during his official visit to Saint Petersburg. The company was rated one of the Top 10 Startups of the Year in 2012 by the Russian Startup Rating. After conducting a company audit in 2012, PricewaterhouseCoopers awarded the company an AAA rating. In 2015-2016 RRT Global formed technology alliances with American engineering company KBR and Russian IT company Yandex. Management and company structure The company is headquartered in the United States. RRT Global has subsidiary operating in the Russian Federation RRT Global‚Äôs R&D; center is located in St. Petersburg. The center includes a pilot plant park, laboratory facilities for studying catalytic systems, an analytical laboratory, and an administrative and logistics center. The company‚Äôs senior management includes Dmitry Shalupkin (CTO), Douglas Harris (CEO), Oleg Giiazov (Director in Russia). Technologies One of the company‚Äôs areas of focus is to improve the technology to obtain MSAT-2 gasoline components based on combining catalytic systems and refining in a single unit. The company is making extensive use of 3D printing for the production of certain equipment components. =PRIS= thumb PRIS is a technology developed by the company for converting light gasoline fractions in a combined process. Papers on this technology have been published in the journal Chemical Engineering and Processing, as well as other specialized scientific journals. Worldwide Refinery Processing Review Included the technology in four of the State-of-the-Art commercial isomerization technologies, together with international providers of advanced technologies: UOP, Axens, GTC. Rossiyskaya Gazeta called the technology ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù. According to this technology, refining and catalytic systems are combined in a single unit, reducing capital and energy costs and reducing environmental pollution. A similar combination principle had previously been used primarily in the pharmaceutical industry. The PRIS technology allows the use of a low- octane straight-run gasoline fraction with a benzole-containing fraction as raw materials. The technology allows the production of high-octane gasoline components meeting the EURO 5 standard. =IC7= I–°7 is a technology developed by the company for isomerization product of oil refining, heptanes. Earlier heptanes not found practical applications and have been used as solvents. The technology helps to increase production of high-octane gasoline.

In these designated areas citizens, interest groups, business owners, and policy makers work together in order to formulate long term economic goals and strategies to meet those goals. There are many different avenues and forms an economic development project can take dependent on the desired outcome.  History  Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, life drastically changed for the citizens of North Carolina. What was once a rural state branded by natural resource exploitation and simple crop cultivation, it has formed a burgeoning labor structure characterized by high capital investment, industrial production, and service provision. From the dark hollows of Murphy, North Carolina to the windy coastal dunes of Nags Head, North Carolina, this socio-economic transformation could be witnessed throughout time. Said proliferation of labor and investment opportunities served to be a magnate for individuals to migrate into the state. During this golden age of growth though, North Carolina's local governments and citizens myopically viewed industries as completely stable means of labor opportunity. Over time, individuals and families within mill and factory towns grew highly dependent upon these jobs and often only invested time, education, and training towards their single industry. This trend was especially evident within the smaller rural communities of North Carolina, and it was thru these industries departure that these communities and governments met the harsh reality of the dangers of a homogenous economic base. In order to assuage the harsh conditions.  Notable regional economic development entities in rural WNC  * The Rural Center of North Carolina * United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development * The North Carolina School of Government * Advantage West * County and City Economic Development Entities  The Rural Center  Founded in 1987, The North Carolina Rural Center was established to aid rural communities in economic advancement. It was because of this narrow mission, that the General Assembly looked towards the Rural Center to assuage the growing unemployment problem in North Carolina. But with a changing economic climate, and rising social and political urgency, the organization realized that there needed to be some restructuring of the organization's methods and strategies, if the needs of the state's citizens were to be fulfilled. Between 2004 and 2005, members of the North Carolina State Legislature sought out the aid of The Rural Center, in order to undergo a study that was to evaluate the state of North Carolina's small rural towns. This formal community analysis was to be conducted in order to give state legislators invaluable insight into their constituents' demographic statistics, and their communities' strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. With the research project underway, representatives Joe Sam Queen of Waynesville, and Walter Dalton of Rutherfordton desired to further expand upon the efforts of The Rural Center in economic development. Through this desire, they initiated and sponsored the creation of the NC STEP Program, which was to be the new muscle of the Rural Center. Small Towns Initiative Adopted on November 4, 2005, the Small Towns Initiative was established by the North Carolina Rural Center, with the mission to incite and facilitate positive economic change and growth within North Carolina's rural small towns. Spearheaded by Lieutenant Governor Bev Perdue, this new policy came into effect in order to make the Rural Center more efficient in providing their services. This policy was created in order to streamline the Rural Center's approach towards economic development, while adjusting some of the shortcomings the organization had under their old strategy. With the implementation of this initiative, The Rural Center postulated that the overall quality of life of North Carolinians would be amplified if real economic growth was realized. Entering Cullowhee NC Waynesville, NC sign IMG 5165 = Programs = Business programs # Agricultural Advancement Consortium # Small Business Credit Initiative # Institute for Rural Entrepreneurship # Micro-enterprise Loan Program Community programs # Building Reuse # Community Development Corporations # Rural Hope, A Healthcare Program # NC Small Towns Prosperity Program (NCSTEP) # Workforce Development Leadership and engagement # Leadership Training # Rural Partners Series # Youth Initiative = Community implementation (economic development case studies) = Within the mountains of Western North Carolina, fourteen communities and three cluster demonstration sites have sought out the initiative. Many of these communities, such as Canton, Old Fort, Robbinsville, and Marshall, enrolled into the program early, so they have since finished the program. Thus, their stories can be analyzed to study how the Small Towns Initiative was implemented in these communities. Canton For many, Canton, North Carolina is a small rural town that is often negatively remembered for an assault on the olfactory senses that one must endure when traveling to Asheville, North Carolina. For those individuals who live within the community, there is a much different perspective of the town. To their community, Canton is a strong and productive place, where individuals overcome obstacles that may seem unconquerable to others. This sense of pride has always been within the hearts of the community, but was amplified in the aftermath of Hurricanes Ivan and Hurricane Francis. As many know, Canton was inundated by the waters that came with the hurricanes of 2004. This led to 9.2 million dollars in damages to the town's small businesses, which ultimately led 192 of them to close down or uproot, thus leaving 370 individuals without jobs. Under the guidance of a Rural Center-appointed team coach, Canton formulated and adopted a long-term master-plan to repair their damaged economy. Under this newly adopted plan, the town is now focusing on improving their aging and dilapidated infrastructure. Also on the community agenda is the plan to enact downtown building beautification and restoration projects. These projects were to be realized by heavy investing both by Canton and though The Rural Center's grant programs. Old Fort Another town that can be used to observe how the Small Towns Initiative implements its NC Step Program, is the small town of Old Fort, North Carolina. Incorporated in 1872, Old Fort grew into a productive society that was well known for its American Revolutionary historic influence. The presence of a recreated revolutionary fort, served the town as the main economic engine for most of the early 1900s. With time though, tourists seemed to lose interest in the attraction and tourism began to decline. Another factor that led to Old Fort's economic decline was the closure of two major employers, which were a furniture factory and a textile mill. With unemployment rising without restraint, community leaders felt as though economic development was just driving by the town on Interstate-40. At this time many other communities such as: West Jefferson, Crossnore, Bakerville, and Todd were facing the same economic issues as Old Fort, but were working together to combat the problem. These towns and cities were analogous to Old Fort in many ways but their historical attributes and economic problems were almost parallel. It was through these similarities, that the Rural Center's community coach for Old Fort helped community leaders join The High Country Cluster, which was a regional economic development cluster that had previously been established by the Rural Center. By Old Fort joining the cluster, they were aided by other communities and their coach to adopt a long-term economic development plan, which would incite sustainable job growth through, heritage tourism, arts and crafts production, and secondary home development. Robbinsville Yet another town in the region that has sought out the benefits of The Small Towns Initiative is Robbinsville, North Carolina which is located in Graham County. Robbinsville was an extreme case for the Rural Center, because it had previously been distinguished as being located in a highly economically distressed Tier 1 County. The town was not always characterized in this way though. Once Robbinsville was well known for its natural aesthetic beauty and the city once enjoyed a highly lucrative tourism base and boasted one of the most traveled roads by motorcyclist, The Tail of The Dragon. But with time the factories and mills that provided a labor base for the community shut down and most development migrated to the US-129 Bypass. Income made from the motorcycling tourist market, proved to be insufficient for the shrinking economy, so the community drastically needed to make changes. With the help of their community coach, the citizens of Robbinsville developed a plan that would pursue business development and job creation, while simultaneously preserving the town's character. Leaders placed natural resources and cultural heritage preservation as economic development tools by considering tourism and second home development as ways to boost their local economy. The promotion of these areas would involve downtown revitalization, and the enhancement of infrastructure to bolster population retention and growth, which would provide a larger more diverse capital base. Marshall The Town of Marshall, North Carolina also participated in the NC STEP because they were struggling to develop or even stay economically afloat. The way in which the Town of Marshall implemented the initiative differed slightly from that of the other towns though. While Marshall was assisted by a community coach, they also sought out the help of faculty and students from North Carolina State University. With this assistance, the community defined their vision for the growth out of the formation of \\"community charrettes.\\" These were to be community leadership team committees, charged with the responsibility of working on specific projects, which were business resources and entrepreneurship, promotions and communications, and master planning. The USDA Rural Development Program Since 2009 the USDA has invested $6.3 billion in rural housing and businesses development, utility construction, and other community programs across North Carolina. More than $1.6 billion was invested in 2012, in which over 8000 families were aided through the Single Family Housing Program. Also during this time 752 jobs were created or saved through Business & Cooperative Programs. =Business and Industry Loan Guarantees= This program provides loan guarantees if expansion and preservation of jobs in rural areas criteria are met. Loan guarantees are available to commercial lenders of whom make credit available for business activity in rural areas with populations up to 50,000. The funds received from this program may be used to purchase land, buildings and equipment, and working capital. Funds received may also be used to refinance debts. =Intermediary Re-lending Program= Through this program, loans are made available to private nonprofit corporations, state or local governments, Native American tribes, or cooperatives of whom provide credit to finance business facilities and economic development projects in rural areas. These work on a revolving loan basis. =Rural Business Opportunity Grants= These Grants provide funding for technical assistance and training, as well as planning activities. =Rural Business Enterprise Grants= These grants finance the development of small and emerging private business enterprises in rural areas. =Rural Economic Development Loans and Grants= The purpose of this grant system is to develop projects that will result in job creation and higher income levels in rural areas. Applicable projects to these grants range from business start-ups and expansion, to medical training projects. =Cooperative Services Technical Assistance= This program assists residents in rural areas in inciting new cooperative business networks, while also maintaining and improving existing cooperatives. =Rural Cooperative Development Grants= These grants are given for the establishment of operation centers for cooperative development. =Value-added Program Grants= This participatory program enables producers of specific agricultural commodities to encounter the economic returns to be made in the value-added market.  NC School of Government  = Publications = Small Towns Big Ideas, NC School of Government This packet provides community leaders with avenues for economic development and brings development theories and ideas to life through the usage of case studies. Within this text, there are forty-five studies of communities that underwent successful economic development projects, which varied widely in approach but all led to economic growth. = Courses = This four-day annual course provides introductory instruction and training for economic development professionals employed by public, civic, private development agencies, and any other individuals pursuing the field. The course is also appropriate for experienced professionals of whom are seeking to update knowledge and skills. This course instructs the fundamentals of economic development practices. The course operates in a manner in which the theoretical and practical meet. By the end of the course it is the goal of the SOG to provide individuals enrolled in the class with the skill-set needed to set proper agendas, formulate affective policy, and implement correctly economic development programs.  Advantage West, Economic Development Group  Certified Entrepreneurial Communities Program (CEC) = Certified Communities = Colonial Theater - Canton NC # Black Mountain # Burke County # Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians # Haywood County # Macon County # Mitchell County # Polk County # Transylvania County # Watauga County # Yancey County = Purpose = The CEC program provided by Advantage West aids communities within western North Carolina formulate goals and strategies pertaining to economic development. Communities that finish the program garner many benefits such as distinguishing signs, advertisement tools such as community profile videos and posters, and much more. With this certification comes much more than a title and a sign as one drives into the county. The certification is meant to be representative of a total reconstruction of how a community views economic development. Above policy change, the certification serves an even greater function, this is to foster economic growth by way of community involvement and action. Hence the goal is to make a local government only a facilitator in the process, the real and affective economic development occurs from the interaction of the community with existing and prospective businesses.
