Description and history The Amory-Appel Cottage is located on the grounds of the former Amory country estate, a large tract of land rising on the northern slope of Mount Monadnock between Old Troy Road to the west and the mountain's Pumpelly Ridge to the east. It is accessed via a private road that snakes across the historic estate. It stands in a grassy clearing east of the site of the estate's main house (no longer extant). It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a steeply pitched gabled roof and exterior finished in wooden shingles. The roof is pierced by small gabled dormers, and a square brick chimney rises above it. Most windows are small-paned sash. The cottage was built about 1911 to a design by Charles Goodell of Parsons, Wait & Goodell, originally to serve as a garage and chauffeur's residence for the Amorys. About 1954, Thomas Handasyd Cabot, a local builder-designer, remodeled it, replacing the original stone chimney with one of brick. It has elements of Shingle and Arts and Crafts styling reminiscent of the early work of Frank Lloyd Wright. At the time of its National Register listing in 1985, it was owned by a grandson of Louise Amory, the estate's principal developer.

The causes normally involve the intensity of casualties—financial, civilian, and military. It also occurs when a belligerent has the ability to leave the conflict easily but continues to stay. War-weariness normally leads to a distrust in government or military leadership and can spark protest and anti-war movements. It can also be fueled when a belligerent is found guilty of war crimes, which can create domestic and international backlash. Rates of enlistment and the morale of the armed- forces are often affected by war-weariness. War-weariness is less likely to appear in military dictatorships, especially those with heavy propaganda and censorship. According to Immanuel Kant, democratic nations have a better chance of having unpopular news of the war reach the masses, which increases their chance and level of war-weariness.

The bill was introduced by the Progressive Conservative government. History The Bill was introduced during the 28th Alberta Legislature in 2013 by Finance Minister Doug Horner. The bill passed first, second, and third readings and went into effect on December 11, 2013. The law applies only to negotiations with the province's largest public-sector union, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees (AUPE). =Government position= The Alberta government described the legislation as a necessary measure for \\"hold(ing) the line on public sector salaries\\" with the intent to \\"bring AUPE back to the negotiating table.\\" =Union position= AUPE launched a legal challenge against the bill, which threatens to impose a wage deal on the 22,000 members of the union. The union claimed that Bill 46 was introduced with little warning and no consultation with the union or its members. > Dave Hancock, then Government House Leader, invoked closure, \\"imposing > severe limitations on debate ... allowing Bill 46 to be passed extremely > quickly,\\" the statement says. The union also claims in the lawsuit that the > bill creates an environment where good-faith bargaining is impossible. > \\"Furthermore, free collective bargaining cannot take place within the long > shadow cast by Bill 46,\\" the statement of claim says. Statements of claim > contain allegations that are not proven in court. A statement of defence has > not yet been filed. A statement of claim filed in December 2013 claims that the bill \\"was introduced with no consultation, was rammed through the legislature and violates its members' fundamental freedoms under the Charter.\\" AUPE at that time was without a collective agreement from March 2013, and negotiations had broken down earlier in the year, subsequent mediation also failing. The union claimed that the province had agreed to arbitration in 2014. Arbitration had not been sought by the union for over 30 years. The Bill would effectively end the option of arbitration and instead impose a settlement by a January 31, 2014 deadline, giving 0% salary increases automatically for the next two fiscal years, followed by 1% increases the following two years. The statement of claim asks the court to strike the law down and reinstate arbitration, award unspecified damages, costs incurred during bargaining and in preparation for arbitration. =Legal challenge and outcomes= In February 2014 Court of Queen's Bench Justice Denny Thomas granted an indefinite injunction against the Bill saying \\"the legislation could irreparably harm labour relations, guts the collective bargaining process and effectively emasculates the AUPE\\" > In a firmly worded decision, Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Denny Thomas > wrote that the government had not negotiated in good faith and appeared to > have intended to impose the 2011 collective agreement from the outset. > Justice Thomas also wrote that in his opinion the legislation was a \\"clear\\" > case of a breach of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \\"The effect is > much more than a salary cap, instead it freezes all of the non-monetary > features of the relationship as well. In addition, it guts the bargaining > process by removing any effective leverage on the part of the workers who, > as a result of other provincial laws, cannot withdraw their labour.\\" One source notes that \\"(t)he injunction suspends the new law and clears the way for the union to proceed with a Charter challenge.\\" After the injunction, Premier Alison Redford continued to defend the legislation and \\"reiterated the government’s intent to appeal the judge’s order.\\" In March 2014, Redford resigned as Premier of Alberta. Guy Smith, President of AUPE, intimated that Bill 46 may have contributed to the decline in popularity that led to her decision to resign. > If the Conservatives want to signal the contentious Redford era is over, > interim Premier Dave Hancock should seriously consider dropping draconian > Bill 46 that suspended collective bargaining and imposed a wage settlement > on 22,000 public servants. Hancock could start by reversing the government’s > decision to an Alberta Court of Queen's Bench ruling that suspended > temporarily Bill 46 last month. \\"Then they need to need to remove Bill 46 > which is a hammer looming over what should be free collective bargaining,\\" > said Smith. \\"Hancock is an intelligent man who understands the lay of the > land. He can change the tone of relations and return to respectful dealings > between government and its front line employees.\\" The next leader should be > aware that Redford’s hard line on labour contributed to her serious slide in > the polls, he added. On April 28, 2014, details emerged of a deal reached between the Hancock government and the AUPE. The tentative agreement called for a lump-sum payment of $1,850 the first year followed by pay increases totalling 6.75 per cent over three years. Members of the AUPE will vote on the agreement in June 2014 before the government ratifies it. > The deal was announced Monday, the same day the government dropped its > appeal of an injunction the union won against legislation that would have > imposed an austere contract similar to ones that went into effect last year > for Alberta physicians and teachers.

The Snokomish did indeed speak Halkomelem. Their dialect was 'Downriver,' rather than 'Upriver,' or 'Island.' Their particular dialect was 'Nicomekl.' History They population was decimated by a smallpox epidemic in 1850, and thereafter some individuals were absorbed into the neighbouring Semiahmoo, whose territory was immediately to the south, and who absorbed the saltwater portion of Snokomish territory (the rest is now Kwantlen territory).

In 1984 he became the world record holder in the discus winning gold at the Summer Paralympics, following this with silver in the discus and bronze in the Pentathlon four years later. Career history Harris was born in Sebastopol, Torfaen, a suburb of Pontypool in south Wales. A keen athlete as a youth, Harris was involved in gymnastics, rugby union and boxing. At the age of 18, Harris was on holiday at a Butlins holiday camp when he fell 18 metres from a big wheel resulting in the paralysis of his legs. The injury left him hospital for five months, and after his release he \\"wasted the next three years in the pub\\". Harris' involvement in parasports began when a friend persuaded him to attend a gym in an attempt to improve his fitness and give him focus. Harris then joined a paraplegic sports club and showed promising as a competitor after winning multiple events at a local sport event. His progress was noticed and the next year he was selected for the 1980 Summer Paralympics in Arnhem in the Netherlands. Harris entered three events, the category 5 discus and shot put and the 85 kg Light- heavyweight weightlifting, but failed to medal. Four years later Harris was back in the Great Britain team at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. Harris originally decided to not apply for the team, after being disgusted at what he saw was the poor treatment of Paralympic athletes in comparison to their Olympic counterparts. He believed that Atlanta should not have been allowed to pull out of hosting the Paralympic sport in 1980, but was talked around to taking part by a friend. At the Games, held at short notice in Stoke Mandeville, England, Harris was entered for the discus, shot put and javelin. Before taking part in the events, he was chosen to take the Paralympic Oath on behalf of all the athletes, an event he described as a \\"phenomenal honour\\". Although Harris did not finish in the top three in either javelin or shot put, his main focus for a medal was the discus. Before his final attempt he was sitting in sixth place, but his Paralympic record breaking throw gave him the gold medal. Harris states that his outlook to life changed after the games, becoming less self-centered and in 1986 he joined up with his training partner and good friend Chris Hallam, who was also an outstanding Paralympic athlete having won gold in the pool at Stoke Mandeville. The two decided to raise funds for, and awareness of, disability sport by taking part in a 400-mile wheelchair trip around Wales in just 11 days. This led to a further fund raising event in 1997 when the two men completed 600-mile in 37 days. The funds they raised allowed for the building of national centre for disability sport to be built at the University of Wales Institute, at the Cyncoed Campus site. In 1988 Harris took part in his third Summer Paralympics, joining the Great Britain team when they travelled to Seoul. He entered two events, the category 5–6 pentathlon and the discus. In the discus he threw 34.98m, to take silver, 1.70m behind the eventual winner Egypt's Mohamed Abdulla Mohamed. He finished fourth in the pentathlon, but was later awarded the bronze medal.Although the Paralympic record of the Pentathlon finals state that Harris finished fourth, in contemporary reports Harris is recorded as winning the bronze in the Seoul Pentathlon which is supported by images of Harris showing his three medals including a bronze and silver Seoul medal here. Harris took part in two more Sumer Paralympics though he did not medal again. At the 1992 Games in Barcelona he competed in the javelin, pentathlon and 4 × 100 m relay, while in 1996 he represented Britain in the Pentathlon. Awards and honours Harris was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1986 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. In 2013 Harris was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame.

Photo by Björn Becker. Casimirsborg is a country house just south of Gamleby, Småland, Sweden. It is situated on Gamlebyviken lake and was built in 1829 in the so-called neoclassical Tjust empire style, after the original 17th-century mansion was destroyed by fire. Early history During the Middle Ages, the site of the present mansion was close to a village named Mæm (as spelled in 1379). The village consisted of two farms, and is first mentioned in 1379 when an Olof of Mem is mentioned as a witness to a land sale at the district court. The following year 1380, Tyrgils Geme, freeman in Västervik, and his wife Catherine sold a small parcel of land in the village to Bo Johnsson Grip (a seneschal), who bought more land in the village in 1383 and named the entire estate Vinäs. In the early 17th century Mem was owned by Sidonia Grip (1585-1652) who on October 6, 1616, married her cousin Count Johan Casimir Lewenhaupt (1583-1634). The latter combined all the farms in the into a unified estate and received manor privileges in 1618. He built a mansion with two wings and renamed the manor for himself, Casimirsborg. The present day estate consists of consists of 13 houses, farmland and forestry. The mansion In 1809, the seventeenth century mansion was destroyed by fire; twenty years later, in 1829, its owners, Count Gustaf Lewenhaupt and his wife Sophie, commissioned architect Uppman and builder Jonas Jonsson to rebuild the house in the then fashionable neoclassical Empire style. Like its predecessor, the new house was built on the foundations of the previous mansion; thus, the cellars date from the 14th century and still contain a dungeon from the first castle on the site dungeon. These cellars are all that remain of the previous buildings.. The house consists of a central block of three floors, flanked by two wings of three floors. It contains informal, low-ceilinged family living accommodation on the ground floor, and a high-ceilinged piano nobile above. The piano nobile contains the grandest and most formal rooms; these include six bedrooms and the principle reception room, the Grand salon, which is believed to be northern Småland's largest room in a private house (about 100 m²). Adjoining the Grand Salon is a chapel designed in the Gothic revival style; this is one of the earliest examples of Gothic revival in Sweden, and was inspired by the Gothic Room at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. The chapel is decorated with trompe-l'œil, and has not been altered since its completion in 1829.Official website. During the late 19th century, the house was mentioned in various travel guides as a destination worth visiting. After Countess Lewenhaupt's death, in 1850, the estate passed from the Lewenhaupt family. Today, it is owned by Björn Becker and his wife Louise Klingspor. The house is not generally open to the public, but private tours, and occasional function hire are possible.

It is a Grade II listed building. There may have been a wooden church on the site at the time of the Domesday book, although the first written record from the Bath cartulary is of 1235. The oldest part of the current stone church is the chancel at the eastern end, which now contains the altar and has a small priest's door, above which is a small carved figure. The nave was added in the 14th century. The three-stage tower, which was added in the 14th or early 15th century, is supported by diagonal buttresses and has a stair turret in the northeast corner. It has six bells which are regularly rung for services. Five of the bells are from the local foundry of the Bilbie family, to which a sixth from the Whitechapel Bell Foundry was added in 1991. The Last Judgement by Henry Strachey above the chancel arch The church, which is adjacent to Stowey House, is built of the same local red sandstone, with alternating lias and red sandstone bands to the nave. It has a tiled roof above the chancel, while the nave and north porch have a slate roof. The church was altered in the 17th century, and in the 19th it underwent a Victorian restoration that included replacement of part of the roof and removal of the double-decker pulpit and a gallery. Inside the church are wall paintings by Henry Strachey from the early 20th century. There are life-sized representations of St Nicholas and St Mary on either side of the altar. Also in the chancel are paintings of the miraculous Feeding the multitude and of disciples on the road to Emmaus. The Last Judgment is pictured over the chancel arch with an equal number of angels of light and darkness. There are also wall monuments from the mid-18th century by Thomas Paty and other sculptors, commemorating the Jones and Sandford families. The font is from the 14th century. The organ was installed in the 1930s and electrified when electricity was brought into the church in 1965. Above the entrance door is a funerary hatchment which was made to celebrate the restoration of Charles II in 1660. During the 16th or 17th century, the parish was a chapelry of Chew Magna. The parish is now part of the benefice of Clutton with Cameley, Bishop Sutton and Stowey within the archdeaconry of Bath.

Its release as a single was limited to the United States. The track features The Leytonstone City Mission Choir and contains a sample of \\"Lions\\", from the 1959 album Way Out Humor as written and performed by Richard Buckley. The track is produced by both Albarn and Richard Russell, whom Albarn had previously worked with on Bobby Womack's comeback album The Bravest Man in the Universe and on the DRC Music album, Kinshasa One Two.  Background  \\"Mr Tembo\\" was recorded for a baby elephant that Albarn met in a national park in Mkomazi, Tanzania. He said in an interview for Rolling Stone: \\"It was recently orphaned and walked onto this aerodrome; the people I know took it in and called it Mr. Tembo. I was there, and I met this little elephant, and he was very sweet. I sang it to him.\\" \\"Tembo\\" in Swahili means \\"elephant\\". On 17 February 2014, Albarn was the subject of an episode of The Culture Show, in which he talked about the album, and his own personal experiences from his earlier life and how they had a profound effect on his songwriting. Albarn spoke about \\"Mr Tembo\\", and said that the eponymous elephant had grown up around gospel music, as his owners were fans, so Albarn decided to incorporate The Leytonstone City Mission Choir, to offer a more gospel element to the track, saying in the programme: \\"If the elephant does hear the finished track, hopefully he'll like it...\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01sdzgl As for the recording process of the album, Albarn started it with nearly 60 songs written down, and then would allow co-producer Richard Russell to pick his favourites, which would then become tracks on his album. With regards to \\"Mr Tembo\\", Albarn said \\"It was recorded on a phone, and in a light-hearted moment, I put it on a list for Richard. He said, 'I'd really like you to try that,' so I did. I started off giving Richard a lot of songs, 60 or 60-plus – he had the editorship. Hence a song like 'Mr Tembo', which I never would have considered recording, because I put that in my 'songs I write for other things', like for kids' birthdays, or in this case, it was for a baby elephant I met in a place called Mkomazi, in Tanzania.\\" An article on the baby elephant that Albarn wrote \\"Mr Tembo\\" about was released. The baby elephant became separated from his mother and Albarn wrote the song as a tribute to the elephant. The track was played in a demo form, for the elephant by Albarn and Paul Simonon when they visited Tanzania. Despite his new carer's efforts, the elephant's mother was nowhere to be found, and Albarn dedicated the song to him. It was played live on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and was very well received by critics, applauding the song for its upbeat nature.http://www.nme.com/news/damon- albarn/76058http://damonalbarn.tumblr.com/post/74509381514/know-more-about-mr- tembo-the-baby-elephant-damon The sample used on the song is that of \\"Lions\\" by American comedian Lord Buckley, from the 1959 album Way Out Humor and features the lyrics: \\"Fred, will you take those lions off the front of the boat? Good God man, lets have some heart in you! Will you please...!?\\" \\"All right.\\" \\"I'm trying to run this expedition in a decent manner...\\"http://www.airbrushmuseum.com/wig_bubbles_lions.htm When asked how the elephant responded to the track Albarn said: \\"To be honest to you, when I sang it to the elephant, it shat itself. Because it was on milk, it was white elephant baby poo, if you can imagine that. It’s quite something at close vicinity.\\" Speaking of the collaborations with The Leytonstone City Mission Choir, Albarn felt that the choir held a nostalgic importance to him and asked the Church if he could record with the choir, \\"Back in Leytonstone, there was a Pentecostal Church at the end of my road that belonged to the city mission. I remember standing outside with my bicycle listening to the singing, but never being able to find an entry point. But it was a very strong childhood memory that I've carried with me. I got in contact with that church, and they've still got a small choir, so they very kindly agreed to sing on the record a bit.\\" On Tuesday 25 March 2014, the track was heard in its full studio form, which features the prominent Lord Buckley sample and a spoken- word portion from Albarn as well. According to Dan Cains of The Sunday Times, \\"Mr Tembo\\" was written for Albarn's daughter Missy: \\"The album's one anomaly, was intended as a birthday gift to his daughter, Missy, for whom Albarn has long written songs. 'I knew it was time to stop,' he deadpans, 'when my daughter cried when I played her one on one of her recent birthdays – out of embarrassment, not pleasure.' All that, plus a gospel choir and an Albarn rap.\\"http://damonalbarn.tumblr.com/post/81927742044/damon-albarn-interview- and-album-track-by-track-guide  Live performances  The track has been performed live many times by Albarn; however the song was heard in its full form on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 12 March 2014, when Albarn and his live band \\"Damon Albarn and the Heavy Seas\\" performed the track with a local American choir. Albarn's band consists of Seye, drummer Pauli the PSM, guitarist Jeff Wootton and Mike Smith on keyboards.http://www.clashmusic.com/videos/damon- albarn-lonely-press-play The band's first performance was at BBC Radio 6 Music Festival on 28 February 2014. Albarn told the audience, \\"This is our first ever gig and it's quite nerve-wracking to be not only playing your first gig but playing it live on radio as well, but I suppose I should be used to it after all these years.\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26390036 The gig also saw the first exclusive plays of songs such as \\"The Selfish Giant\\" and \\"Mr Tembo\\", Albarn also played \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\" from Gorillaz eponymous debut album and The Good, the Bad & the Queen single \\"Kingdom of Doom\\" as well as \\"El Mañana\\" from Demon Days and the Blur B-side \\"All Your Life\\".http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/03/watch-damon-albarns-first-solo- performance-at-bbc-6-music-festival/  Music video  On 22 April 2014, guitarist Seye updated on Tumblr that Albarn and his live band The Heavy Seas were filming a music video for the song.http://damonalbarn.tumblr.com/tagged/audio The music video was released on 13 May 2014. The video features Albarn and his band The Heavy Seas plus footage of the real Mr. Tembo – an orphaned baby elephant Albarn met while travelling in Tanzania. The studio-shot portions of the video were filmed in the Pentecostal City Mission Church in Leytonstone and features the church choir, who also sing on the album.https://www.nme.com/news/damon-albarn/77284  Critical reception  Matthew Horton of NME wrote in his track-by-track review: \\"It takes a song about a baby elephant to inject a spring into the album's step, despite Mr. Tembo needing a 'helping hand' to get up the hill. At times, Mr. Tembo's African guitar bounce is so jaunty it feels as if it could launch into 'Upside Down', surf-bum folkie Jack Johnson's deathless theme to the venerated movie adaptation of Curious George.

Life and career =Early life and WWII career= Nobuhiko Ushiba was born 16 November 1909 in the city of Kobe in Japan.The Asia Who's Who, p. 379. His grandfather was an executive with the San'yō Railway (which had its headquarters in Kobe). His father was a silk merchant whose business failed under pressure from low-cost imports.Rix, p. 4.Malcolm, Andrew H. \\"Japan's Doughty Trade Aide at U.S. Talks.\\" New York Times. December 13, 1977. His second cousin was Haru Matsukata, who later married the United States Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer (1961 to 1966). Nobuhiko was the third son in the family, and his older brother, Tomohiko Ushiba, later was private secretary to Prince Fumimaro Konoe.Welfield, p. 219. He did not attend school until his parents moved to Tokyo soon after the Taishō period began in July 1912. He graduated from two of the city's most prestigious public schools, the First Middle School and the First High School (now the Tokyo University of Agriculture First High School). Due to Japan's growing ties with the German Empire and his father's experience in international trade, he became somewhat fluent in the German language in high school.Rix, p. 5. Ushiba then entered the Tokyo Imperial University, where he graduated in 1932 with a degree in law. He was a championship rower, and just missed qualifying for the 1932 Summer Olympics. Ushiba did not aspire to a career in the foreign service, but with a worldwide depression depressing job prospects, his fluency in German, and his family's experience in international trade, he entered the diplomatic corps after graduation.Burgess, John. \\"Ex-Japanese Ambassador Ushiba Dies.\\" Washington Post. January 1, 1985. (Had he qualified for the Olympics, he would have been unable to sit for his foreign service qualifying exam.) He received an appointment as first secretary at the Japanese Embassy in Berlin, and served there until the end of World War II (with a brief stint in the Japanese embassy in London just prior to the outbreak of the war).\\"Seasoned Negotiator: Nobuhiko Ushiba.\\" New York Times. November 14, 1970. He was very close to General Hiroshi Ōshima, Japan's ambassador to Nazi Germany. By at least 1939, he was helping to run a \\"bureaucratic intelligence service\\" which spied on Nazi Germany for the Japanese government.Mathias, p. 31. He made at least one trip back to Japan during the height of the war. He flew from Berlin to Turkey (then a neutral nation), then pass over the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, and Siberia before reaching Japan. In early 1944, he tried to persuade Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, an Imperial Japanese Army general and commander of the General Defense Command, that Japan was losing World War II and should negotiate with the United States.Shillony, p. 58; Hoyt, p. 185. =Early post-war career= Ushiba's foreign service career faltered badly in the post-war period due to his close association with General Ōshima and his service in Germany. Although he was never formally purged from the service, he quit. He served as Ōshima's defense counsel during the Tokyo War Crimes Trials, and then went into private business. He and some friends attempted to import Malaysian iron ore, but their business quickly failed.Rix, p. 9. He was rehabilitated and brought back into the foreign service by Shigeru Yoshida, Prime Minister of Japan, who knew him when Yoshida was Japan's ambassador to the United Kingdom just before the war.Nish, p. 228. Ushiba's post-war career was heavily involved in economics. Upon his return to government service, he was appointed to Japan's Foreign Exchange Control Board in 1949, where as chief of the secretariat he supervised the investment of foreign funds in industries that were essential to Japan's economic recovery. He was appointed Director-General of the International Trade Bureau in Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry in 1951. He was appointed a counsellor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1954, and later that year served as a delegate to the Japan-Sweden trade talks. Ushiba's overseas service began in 1955, when he was appointed deputy minister in Japan's embassy in Rangoon, Burma. In January 1957, he left Burma and was appointed Consul-General at the Japanese Consulate General in New York City. That same year, he was elevated from counsellor to Chief of the Economic Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Yokio, p. 218. a position which he held until June 23, 1964, when he was promoted to Deputy Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs. He held that position until April 14, 1967.Gatz and Keefer, p. xxix. Ushiba was appointed Ambassador to Canada in 1961, serving until 1964.Saxon, Wolfgang. \\"Nobuhiko Ushiba, Ex-Envoy to U.S.\\" New York Times. December 31, 1984. Accessed 2014-03-21. He left that position to lead the Japanese delegation to the Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which lasted from 1964 to 1967.Barnhart, p. 236, fn. 36. When the Kennedy Round ended, Ushiba returned to Tokyo and was promoted to Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in April 1967,Rix, p. 12. the highest position possible for a career official. =U.S. ambassadorship and later career= Ushiba was appointed Ambassador to the United States on July 10, 1970, and presented his credentials on September 21. Ushiba's term as ambassador was tumultuous. He himself believed that the fundamental relationship between Japan and the United States was changing. Although the relationship remained exceptionally strong, in the past Japan had asked the United States to do things for it. Now, Ushiba felt, Japan was in a position to do much more economically for developing nations in Southeast Asia, and was being asked to do favors for the United States economically (such as permit more imports and lower trade barriers). Ushiba also had to handle the fallout from several major American foreign policy decisions. As The Washington Post put it: Ushiba's ambassadorship \\"is remembered as a tumultuous time in the two countries' relations, due to the two 'Nixon shocks' — detente with China and the devaluation of the dollar.\\" A treaty ending the American military occupation of Okinawa was signed by him in June 1971.Smith, Terence. \\"Pact for Okinawa Return Signed.\\" New York Times.

March 2, 1972. the Nixon administration imposed stringent new restrictions on imports despite Ushiba's pleas. Ushiba retired from the foreign service in 1973 and returned to Japan. He served as an advisor to the Foreign Ministry, and became more active in politics. In November 1977, Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda appointed him Minister of State for External Economic Affairs, a cabinet post that was created specially for him.Ofusa, Junnosuke. \\"Reaction Positive to Fukuda's Shift for Cabinet Posts.\\" New York Times. November 29, 1977. Within two months, he negotiated and signed a major agreement easing trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan which was widely hailed.Malcolm, Andrew H. \\"U.S. and Japan Reach An Accord on Easing of Tensions.\\" New York Times.

Ushiba resigned as minister on July 31, 1979.\\"Japan Trade Official Quits.\\" United Press International. August 1, 1979. The Japanese government immediately appointed him chair of the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group, a commission set up by the governments of Japan and the United States to study trade issues affecting the two nations. The commission changed its name to the Japan-U.S. Advisory Commission in 1983. =Personal life and death= Nobuhiko Ushiba was a tall man of rugged build, and an avid sportsman. He married Fujiko Kobayashi, and the couple had four children (a son and three daughters). Ushiba died of an unspecified liver problem at a Tokyo hospital on December 31, 1984. His wife and four children survived him. The same day he died, the Government of Japan conferred the Order of the Paulownia Flowers, the highest regularly conferred honor in the Japanese honors system. In popular culture is a 2009 made- for-television motion picture about Jirō Shirasu, a government official who famously demanded respect from General Douglas MacArthur in a Christmas 1945 meeting. The role of Nobuhiko Ushiba was played by actor Kanji Ishimaru. On October 13, 1986, the Ushiba Memorial Foundation was established to provide research and new thinking on issues of global trade.London, p. 54. It is headquartered in the former Moral Re-Armament headquarters in the Nishi-Azabu District in Tokyo.Davis and Roberts, p. 177.

Its role is aerial reconnaissance and signals intelligence. The squadron is nicknamed the \\"World Watchers\\" and is based at NAS Whidbey Island, flying Lockheed EP-3E Aries II aircraft.  Squadron History  The lineage of VQ-1's \\"World Watchers\\" can be traced back to two PBY-5A Catalina \\"Black Cats\\" modified for electronic reconnaissance during World War II. The unit formally established as the Special Electronic Search Project at NAS Sangley Point, in October 1951. By 13 May 1953, when it was redesignated Detachment Able of Airborne Early Warning Squadron One (VW-1), the unit operated four P4M-1Q Mercators. = 1950s = When Detachment Able was reorganized into Electronic Countermeasures Squadron One (VQ-1) at Iwakuni, Japan on 1 June 1955, it was the first squadron dedicated to electronic warfare. The EA-3 Skywarrior served the squadron for the next three decades. = 1960s = An EC-121M Warning Star of fleet VQ-1 World Watchers accompanied by a McDonnell F-4B Phantom II In 1960, not only was VQ-1 moved to Atsugi, Japan, and redesignated Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE, but the last Mercator was retired and replaced by the first of many WV-2Q Super Constellations (also known as \\"Willie Victor\\"). They would remain the backbone of VQ-1's long-range, land-based reconnaissance efforts through the Vietnam War. The squadron's involvement in the Vietnam War started characteristically, at the very beginning when a Skywarrior crew was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for their role in the Gulf of Tonkin incident of 2–5 August 1964. For the next nine years, VQ-1 would operate from Da Nang, NAS Cubi Point, Bangkok, and aircraft carriers on patrol in Yankee Station and other bases in Southeast Asia. VQ-1's aircrews supported countless air strikes and are credited with assisting in the destruction of numerous MiG aircraft and Komar patrol boats. 15 April 1969, an EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-1 on a reconnaissance mission was shot down by North Korean MiG-21 aircraft over the Sea of Japan. All 31 Americans (30 sailors and 1 marine) on board were killed, which constitutes the largest single loss of U.S. aircrew during the Cold War era. The first EP-3 Aries I joined the squadron in 1969, beginning the replacement program for the Super Constellations. = 1970s = A VQ-1 EP-3B at NAS Agana, Guam, April 1972 On 16 March 1970, a Super Constellation crashed while landing at Da Nang with the loss of the majority of the crew. The next aircraft lost by VQ-1 was in September 1973 when an EA-3B, with five crewmen, was on an overwater navigational training flight from Guam to the Philippines. Unable to locate land, the crew was forced to bail out at the fuel exhaustion point. The entire crew was picked up by a helicopter from the Japanese destroyer Haruna. In 1971, VQ-1 moved its homeport to NAS Agana, Guam, while retaining a permanent detachment at Atsugi, Japan. At that time it absorbed Heavy Photographic Squadron 61 (VAP-61) and its former parent unit, VW-1. At the end of U.S. combat operations in Vietnam in 1973 VQ-1 began a move back to providing open ocean tactical electronic support to Seventh Fleet carrier battle groups. In April 1975, two VQ-1 EP-3B aircraft and three aircrews were tasked and deployed to NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, in support of the pending evacuation of Vietnam as part of CTF 72. VQ-1 was given the responsibility of providing 24-hour-a-day overlapping coverage in the Vietnam Combat Zone with supporting maintenance, intelligence and operations personnel. Given a specific list of criteria, VQ-1 personnel made the first call to recommend the start of Operation Frequent Wind. Those squadron aircrew members directly involved in the flight operations were recognized as serving in the Vietnam Combat Zone and were eventually awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation, Humanitarian Action Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal when in 2003 Operation Frequent Wind was reclassified as the 18th and final campaign of the Vietnam War. EA-3B VQ-1 in flight near NAF Atsugi = 1980s = CDR John T. Mitchell assumed command of VQ-1 in March 1984. Ten months later, on 23 January 1985, he and eight other VQ-1 personnel were killed when the squadron VIP aircraft was lost at sea en route to Guam from Atsugi. A massive air and sea search and rescue effort failed to locate any trace of the VA-3B or its crew and passengers. They were presumed killed or lost at sea. After the departure of the last Skywarrior in the late 1989, the squadron flew the EP-3 Aries I exclusively. = 1990s = In 1991 the squadron closed its permanent detachment in Atsugi, Japan after 30 years and moved it to Misawa, Japan. In the same year, VQ-1 received the first EP-3E Aries II, an upgraded version of the Aries I using modified P-3C airframes. The squadron played a key role in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In 1994, as a result of the base closure of NAS Agana, VQ-1, the homeport changed to NAS Whidbey Island, USA. In July 1994, VQ-1 retired the Navy's oldest operational P-3, EP-3E Aries I. Its retirement also marked VQ-1's transition to all EP-3E Aries II mission aircraft. = 2000s = An EP-3E Aries II of VQ-1 in flight in 2006. On April 1, 2001, an incident occurred when a mid-air collision between an EP-3E of VQ-1 and a People's Liberation Army Navy J-8II fighter jet resulted in an international dispute between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. The accident happened after one of the J-8s, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Wang Wei made two close passes to the EP-3. On the third pass, it collided with the EP-3. The J-8 broke into two pieces. The EP-3 made an unauthorized emergency landing at Lingshui airfield, due to severe damage, after at least 15 distress signals had gone unanswered. For 15 minutes after landing, the EP-3 crew continued to destroy sensitive items and data on board the aircraft, as per Department of Defense protocol. They disembarked from the aircraft after soldiers looked through windows, pointed guns, and shouted through bullhorns. The crew of the EP-3 was released on April 11, 2001, and returned to their base at Whidbey Island via Honolulu, Hawaii, where they were subject to two days of intense debriefings, followed by a heroes' welcome. Within in a month of the September 11 attacks the squadron was flying missions over Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2002, VQ-1 maintained a permanent detachment in Misawa, Japan, in addition to its home base at Whidbey and its presence in the Persian Gulf. Its area of responsibility reaches from the east coast of Africa to the west coast of the United States, roughly two-thirds of the world's surface. When defense budget reductions mandated the disestablishment of VQ-1's sister squadron, VQ-2, in May 2012, VQ-1 became the U.S. Navy's sole fleet air reconnaissance squadron flying the EP-3E Aries II and dedicated to the signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission.http://www.whidbeynewstimes.com/news/a-sad-day-at-nas-whidbey-as- vq-2-disestablished/# References External links * VQ-1 Homepage Category:Fleet air reconnaissance squadrons of the United States Navy ","title":"VQ-1"},{"id":"42275800","text":"James Bateman (born September 16, 1954) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the World Hockey Association (WHA).

The Japoma Bridge (also known as the Edea German Bridge or the German Bridge) is a railway bridge over the Sanaga River near Edea, Cameroon. Note there is another bridge on the Dibamba River called the Yapoma Bridge. This is sometimes transcribed as the Japoma Bridge which causes confusion, for example, in accounts of the fighting during WW1 - see sources to the First Battle of Edea. Gorges (1920: 153) shows the other one.  History and technical details  The steel arch bridge was designed and built by the Gutehoffnungshütte of Oberhausen. Before being delivered, the bridge was assembled in Germany so it could be tested. It was then disassembled and transported in pieces by boat to Cameroon in 1911. It measures 160m in length, and was the largest in Africa at the time of erection. The vertical columns starting at the arch grille are used as a suspension for the roadway. One half of the arch was first assembled on the ground and the other built on floating barges, which were then correctly assembled. It remains an architectural relic of the German colonial era in Cameroon. The strategic location of the bridge was seen during the First and Second Battles of Edea during World War I. The bridge was also visited by the entire German crew of the Wahehe, with certain officers going right up to the bank of the river, August 2, 1937, in what was thought to be a reconnaissance of the area. The bridge was the only passage point over the Sanaga Rivery for trains, vehicles and pedestrians until the early 80s. It is now used as a footpath and cycle track.

The Company markets a portfolio of branded products, including: TREXIMET®, SILENOR®, a non-narcotic product indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep maintenance, KHEDEZLA™, as well as CEDAX®, an antibiotic for middle ear infections. The Company promotes its branded products to physicians through its Pernix sales force and distributes its generic portfolio through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Cypress Pharmaceuticals and Macoven Pharmaceuticals. Founded in 1996, the Company is based in Morristown, New Jersey. In 2014, Pernix became one of the fastest growing specialty pharmaceutical companies in the US, with an expanding CNS franchise and opportunities to branch out into adjacent therapeutic areas. Additionally, in 2014, the company completed several acquisitions including the acquisition of TREXIMET® from GSK and KHEDEZLA™ from Osmotica. In 2013, the company completed several acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies including Cypress Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hawthorn Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Somaxon Pharmaceuticals Inc. On February 18, 2019 Pernix Therapeutics Holdings filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code meaning that the payments on its debt obligations should be immediately paid due to the event of default. Pernix and its subsidiaries simultaneously have filed a variety of “first day” motions in order to continue their operations in ordinary course of business without interruption pending the sale of their assets in one or more going concern sales pursuant to a competitive bidding and auction process. According to Cbonds, overall amount of outstanding notes is equal to $254 million. Disgraced former CEO of Pernix Therapeutics, John Sedor, filed a claim in bankruptcy court for the amount of $1,534,375 after robbing the company, employees, and shareholders of any wealth. John Sedor willingly and knowingly misled employees and shareholders of the company while backdoor negotiating an exit plan for Highbridge Capital Management to inflate the stock price a week before the bankruptcy was declared. This allowed all the insiders who knew of the impending Chapter 11 bankruptcy to sell their shares at a premium.

Its large 4-cylinder engine placed it initially in the 10CV car tax class, though a larger engine later made it a contender in the 11CV class. The \\"G7\\" long wheelbase version of the car was offered for taxi work from April 1933, and Vivaquatre taxis continued to operate till the end of the 1950s. Origins The Vivaquatre originated as an offshoot of the development of the Renault Primaquatre which had come to the market a year earlier. The two cars shared a broadly similar chassis design, although the Vivaquatre featured, even in its \\"normal\\" configuration, a wheelbase lengthened by . Factory assigned project codes also hint at the shared origins of the two models. The original Vivaquatre was identified as project \\"KZ7\\" while the original Primaquatre was coded \\"KZ6\\". The predecessor model was in both cases known at the time as the Renault 10CV, but is identified in retrospect by the more distinctive project code as the \\"KZ\\". Description =Body= The Vivaquatre replaced the Renault 10CV which had been as a robust unpretentious car. The Vivaquatre followed the same pattern, closely resembling the earlier car in terms of its principal mechanical elements. The manufacturer offered various \\"berline\\" (sedan/saloon) bodies but there was nothing so frivolous as a cabriolet or coupé bodied version. There was, however, a choice of two wheelbase lengths, the longer of which supported a \\"six-light\\" body (with three windows on each side) and underpinned the Vivaquatre's long running popularity with the trade of the taxi version. The Vivaquatre was, in its time, the largest of Renault's four-cylinder models. It could easily be distinguished from models further up in the Renault range by its stand alone headlights and uncovered rear wheel at a time when the manufacturer's larger cars had their head-lights integrated into the front wings and the rear wheels partially covered by fashionable so- called \\"spats\\". The Vivaquatre's four cylinder engine also allowed for a shorter bonnet than that to be found on the six-cylinder Renaults. The car's no-nonsense image was further enhanced by a choice, at the time of the motor show in October 1935, between just two colours on the \\"Luxe\\" version, these being black and dark blue. Buyers of the \\"Grand Luxe\\" version found the colour palette extended to four, through the addition of grey and bordeaux. For the interior there was no choice but to go for standard \\"marron\\" (chestnut) coloured fabric. =Engine and runnings gear= The 4-cylinder side-valve 2120cc fitted on the original Vivaquatre provided a claimed maximum output of 35 hp. The listed power output increased, but the engine size remained constant through the subsequent \\"KZ17\\" (1934) and \\"KZ23\\" (1935) versions of the car. Power was delivered to the rear wheels, and the three speed transmission came without synchromesh. =Evolution= The car's evolution followed the Renault tradition of a long series of incremental changes, and there were also frequent body changes, as the car's style became progressively more modern and \\"aerodynamic\\". The situation is complicated, in retrospect, by the tendency of the Renault catalogues to offer for sale more than one generation of the model at a time. From April 1932 the manufacturer added the option of paying (in 1932) an extra 4,000 francs of an \\"SA\\" version of the engine. \\"SA\\" stood for \\"Suspendu Amorti\\" which was intended to highlight changes to the engine mountings designed to reduce the effects of engine vibration. This presumably was in response to the \\"Moteur flottant\\" (\\"floating engine\\") introduced at the same time by Citroën. 1933 (1934 Model Year) Renault Vivaquatre KZ13 (1933) At the 27th Paris Motor Show in October 1933 Renault were displaying the \\"KZ13\\" version of the Vivaquatre. Both the \\"normal\\" and \\"long\\" bodied cars retained the conventional square- backed style of the early 1930s, but the corners were a little more rounded and, most obviously, the previously vertical front grill was now raked at an angle. (The same fashion driven change was being applied to the Citroën Rosalie at this time.) Renault were advertising six different standard body options, all of which were types of \\"berline\\" (sedan/saloon). Two featured two side windows on each side and four were \\"six-light\\" designs, with three windows on each side of the body. The six body types (with October 1933 listed prices) were: * \\"Berline Luxe: 5 places\\" 23,900 francs, * \\"Berline Grand Luxe: 5 places\\" 25,400 francs, * \\"Conduite Intérieure Luxe: 7 places\\" 29,600 francs, * \\"Conduite Intérieure Grand Luxe: 7 places\\" 28,400 francs, * \\"Taxi: 7 places & sliding roof\\" 30,000 francs, * \\"Berline commerciale 880 kg\\" 21,000 francs. A more slippery shape would join the line-up in Spring 1934 with the addition of the \\"Conduite Intérieure Aérodynamique: 5 places\\" 23,100 francs, the price of which suggested that it was intended for production in relatively large volumes. A new sequence of project codes was marked by the arrival of the Vivaquatre \\"ADL1\\" in 1936. Although the car still used a large 4-cylinder engine, the engine size was increased to 2383cc and claimed maximum power was now 56 HP achieved at 3,300 rpm. 1936 (1937 Model Year) By the time of the 30th Paris Motor Show in October 1936 the Vivaquatre used what appeared to be the same \\"aérodynamique\\" body shell as the manufacturer's 6-cylinder models, but from the side it was clear that the nose and therefore the overall length of the car was nevertheless still significantly shorter, reflecting the lesser length of its four cylinder side-valve engine (by now grown to 2,383cc). The Vivaquatre was a large car by the standards of the time and place, but its power unit and \\"familiale\\"/\\"utilitaire\\" character placed it at the bottom end of Renault's extensive range of large cars. While the publicity from his principal rival, Andre Citroen, made much of the \\"tout-acier\\" (\\"all- steel\\") body structure of his modern mass-produced cars, Louis Renault's relationship with Ambi Budd was characterized by a long standing litigation involving alleged patent infringement, and Renault publicity avoided mention of the structural principals used to construct Renault car bodies, but the increasingly curvaceous shapes of the car bodies and the maximisation of shared body panels across several different sizes of car model indicate that Renault car bodies by now had little in common with the heavier labour- intensive timber frame car bodies that had still been mainstream five years earlier. For the 1937 model year the Vivaquatre \\"ADL2\\" received the new \\"wrap- around trapedoidal\\" front grill shared with other Renaults and the headlights integrated into the front wings now had wind-cheating covers. Plain disc wheels were replaced by disc wheels each with 12 holes placed in a ring pattern between the hub and the outer rim of the wheel. The sloping rear made it possible to include an extra bulge for a boot//trunk accessible from outside, although the entry level cars came without any opening at the back apart from the flap that covered the now horizontally stowed spare wheel. Although the bodies were more streamlined, the range of standard bodies listed was not so different. The five body types (with listed prices also little changed, reflecting several deflationary years experienced at this stage of the economic depression) at the 1936 motor show were: * \\"Berline Luxe without/with boot/trunk\\" 23,800 francs/24,600 francs, * \\"Berline Grand Luxe without/with boot/trunk\\" 25,000 francs/25,800 francs, * \\"Berline Conduite Intérieure Luxe: 6-light (6 side windows)without/with boot/trunk\\" 26,300 francs/27,100 francs, * \\"Berline Conduite Intérieure Grand Luxe: 6-light (6 side windows)without/with boot/trunk\\" 27,500 francs/28,300 francs, * \\"Berline Commerciale\\" 24,000 francs, Final Years During the ensuing years three more versions followed, the \\"BDH1\\", \\"BDH3\\" and \\"BDH4\\". Mechanically, however, the new numbers reflected no further significant changes after 1936. What did change was the all-steel bodies which became progressively more \\"streamlined\\" and featured increasingly complex panel shapes. More steeply sloping tails and more intricately styled fronts also correlated with longer overhangs, and by 1939, when the Vivaquatre was pensioned off,Odin, L.C.

History  The protein was discovered in Masatoshi Takeichi’s lab while looking for potential binding partners for the N-terminal region of p120-catenin. PLEKHA7 was identified by mass spectrometry in lysates of human intestinal carcinoma (Caco-2) cells in a GST-pull down using N-terminal GST- fusion p120 catenin as bait. It was also independently discovered in Sandra Citi’s group as a protein interacting with globular head domain of the Paracingulin in a yeast two-hybrid screen. PLEKHA7 localizes at epithelial zonular AJs.  Structure  The structure of PLEKHA7 is characterized by two WW domains followed by a Pleckstrin homology domain (PH) in the N-terminal region. In the C-terminal half, the protein contains three coiled coil (CC) domains and two Proline-rich (Pro) domains. PLEKHA7 has been detected in different isoforms in a tissue specific manner. Two isoforms of 135 kDa and 145 kDa have been reported in colon, liver, lung, eye, pancreas, kidney and heart. Additionally, two major transcripts of 5.5 kb and 6.5 kb have been identified in brain, kidney, liver, small intestine, placenta and lung, while only one PLEKHA7 mRNA transcript of 5.5 kb is identified in heart, brain, colon and skeletal muscle.  Protein-protein interactions  In vitro interaction studies were pursued to map the interaction(s) of PLEKHA7 with p120Catenin (residues 538-696), Nezha (CAMSAP3) (residues 680-821), paracingulin (residues 620-769) and Afadin (residues 120-374). The protein PDZD11 was identified as a protein interacting through its N-terminal region with the N-terminal WW domain of PLEKHA7, based on 2-hybrid screen and analysis of PLEKHA7 immunoprecipitates Unlike most other AJ proteins, but similar to afadin, PLEKHA7 is exclusively detected in the zonular apical part of AJ, but not in the “puncta adherentia” along lateral membranes of the epithelial cells. Cellular localization and tissue distribution of PLEKHA7 has been confirmed by Immunoelectron microscopy (Immuno-EM) of wild type and knock down intestinal epithelial tissues.  Function  The first identified function of PLEKHA7 was is to contribute to integrity and stability of the zonula adherens junctions by linking the E-cadherin/p120 complex to the minus ends of microtubules (MTs) through Nezha (CAMSAP3). The PLEKHA7-Nezha- MTs complex allows transport of the KIFC3 (a minus end directed motor) to the AJ. However, in Eph4 cell line, PLEKHA7 is recruited to E-cadherin based AJ by Afadin, independently of p120. PLEKHA7 knockdown studies in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells indicated its requirement for the AJ localization of paracingulin. Furthermore, the PLEKHA7 homolog in zebrafish, Hadp1, is required for proper heart function and morphogenesis in embryo, regulating the intracellular dynamics through the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PIK4) pathway. In 2015, researchers discovered that PLEKHA7 recruits the so-called microprocessor complex (association of Drosha and DGCR8 proteins) to a growth- inhibiting site (apical zonula adherens) in epithelial cells instead of sites at basolateral areas of cell–cell contact containing tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 and active Src. Loss of PLEKHA7 disrupts miRNAs regulation, causing tumorigenic signaling and growth. Restoring normal miRNA levels in tumor cells can reverse that aberrant signaling.Distinct E-cadherin-based complexes regulate cell behaviour through miRNA processing or Src and p120 catenin activity. Kourtidis et al. 2015 In 2015 it was also discovered that PLEKHA7 has a role in controlling susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin Cells lacking PLEKHA7 are injured by the toxin, but recover after intoxication. Mice knockout for PLEKHA7 are viable and fertile, and when infected with methycillin-resistant S. aureus USA300 LAC strain they show a decreased disease severity in both skin infection and lethal pneumonia, thus identifying PLEKHA7 as a potential nonessential host target to reduce S. aureus virulence during epithelial infections. In 2016, researchers found that PLEKHA7 recruits the small PDZ protein PDZD11 to adherens junctions, thus resulting in the stabilisation of nectins at adherens junctions.http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2016/04/04/jbc.M115.712935.full.pdf Knock-out of PLEKHA7 results in the loss of PDZD11 from epithelial adherens junctions, and this is rescued by the introduction of exogenous PLEKHA7. The N-terminal 44 residues of PDZD11 interact with the first WW domain of PLEKHA7. In the absence of either PLEKHA7 or PDZD11, the amount of nectin-3 and nectin-4 detected at junctions is decreased, as well as total nectin levels, through proteasome-mediated degradation. PDZD11 interacts directly with the cytoplasmic PDZ-binding motif of nectins, through its own PDZ domain. Proximity ligation assay shows that PLEKHA7 is associated to nectins in a PDZD11-dependent manner. Nectins are the second major class of transmembrane adhesion molecules at adherens junctions, besides cadherins. Therefore, PLEKHA7lstabilises both cadherins and nectins at AJ.  Clinical significance  Genome-wide association studies suggest that PLEKHA7 is associated with blood pressure and hypertension and primary angle closure glaucoma. Also, an increased expression of PLEKHA7 in invasive lobular breast cancer has been reported. In a more recent study, the expression of PLEKHA7 protein in high grade ductal breast carcinomas, and lobular breast carcinomas was found to be very low or undetectable by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, despite the detection of PLEKHA7 mRNA A Mayo Clinic study published online in August 2015 found that PLEKHA7 is mis-localized or lost in almost all breast and kidney tumor patient samples examined.

The Lamalcha War On 20 April 1863, a shelling of their village on Kuper Island by the Royal Navy's HMS Forward led to a series of events known as the Lamalcha War or Lamalchi Affair. The reason for the shelling was the colonial authorities of the Colony of Vancouver Island believed the village was home to three men who had killed settlers.

The Hwlitsum were never granted reserves or band status and are currently seeking recognition as a band government from the governments of British Columbia and Canada. The Hwlitsum are descendants of the Lamalchi (also called Lamalcha) peoples of Penelakut Island (formerly Kuper Island) in the Gulf Islands.Miller 2007, p. 131. Hwlitsum refers to Canoe Pass, near Steveston in Richmond, British Columbia and means “People of the Cattails”.Cryer 2007, p. 333.Miller 2003, p. 152.  Origin stories  * On Penelakut Island, two cedar logs lay on the shore. From these logs came the first man and woman on the island. These people became the ancestors of the Hul'qumi'num-speaking nations along with others who landed on mountains and hills on Vancouver Island or emerged from sands of Penelakut Island.Arnett 1999, p. 17. * Two Sqwxwa'mush families, Ah-Thult and Hola-Pult, built houses on an island. The houses were at different bays with a point of rock in-between them. Ah-Thult's family was unsuccessful hunting and sought the advice of Hola-Pult. Hola-Pult's family had great success hunting and suggested that perhaps Ah-Thult was not clean and pure enough to be visited by the hunting spirit. Ah-Thult left his family to go into the mountains until he was clean. While there he was visited by spirits who showed him how to be a successful hunter. Upon Ah-Thult's return Hola-Pult decided to steal this ability but Ah-Thult tricked him into leaving the Island. Hola-Pult and his men were lured to Penelakut Island and decided to relocate there.Cryer 2007, p. 319-324. This became the home for the Lamalchi people who lived on the land until relocating to Hwlitsum (Canoe Pass).Miller 2014, p. 14.  History  Hul'qumi'num custom identifies groups of people by the location of their winter village.Miller 2014, p. 14. The Lamalchi's winter home was on Penelakut Island at Lamalcha Bay.Cryer 2007, p. 145. Prior to 2010 Penelakut Island was named Kuper Island.Maclachlan 1998, p. 172.

When the Lamalchi were prevented from returning to winter in Lamalcha Bay in 1892 they wintered in Hwlitsum and, in keeping with Hul'qumi'num custom, changed their name to Hwlitsum at that time.Miller 2014, p. 14. The Hwlitsum Nation's ancestry can be traced back to the late 1790s.Miller 2014, p. 12. References and maps verify the Lamalchi living and working on Penelakut Island in the early eighteen-hundreds.Miller 2014, p. 12. European explorers had only made brief, and superficial exploration into Hul'qumi'num territories by the early 1850s.Egan 2008, p. 139. At contact and when the British claimed sovereignty in 1846, the Lamalchi “were an autonomous social entity within the larger Coast Salish social network.”Miller 2014, p. 21. The Lamalchi had family ties and marriage connections to the Lummi Nation, Musqueam Nation, and Katzi Nation.Miller 2007, p. 131. and are part of the larger Cowichan community. The Lamalchi were one of the subtribes of the Cowichan people and had different histories and cultural practices from their ancestral neighbours on Penelakut Island.Miller 2003, p. 153.Miller 2003, p. 152. Penelakut Island was shared between the Penelakut, the Yekaloas and the Lamalchi who all maintained separate and individual villages.Miller 2014, p. 14. The Lamalcha Nation was not recognized by the British when the international border between Canada and the United States was drawn in 1846.Miller 2003, p. 152. The Lamalchi were not identified by the British and United States authorities that settled the border dispute by agreeing to use the 49th parallel as the international border. This oversight left the Lamalchi in a position of not being accounted for in any treaty agreements. The Hwlitsum, descendants of the Lamalchi, are working with the Canadian government today to correct this omission in the written records. Prior to and at the time of contact, the Lamalchi were involved in intertribal wars along the coast. Warriors would speak to an approaching canoe in Hul'qumi'num. If the occupants did not respond in Hul'qumi'num they were prevented from travelling in Hul'qumi'num waters.Miller 2007, p. 132. The Lamalcha/Hwlitsum defended themselves against Royal Navy attack in the days of the Colony of Vancouver Island, and in the wake of that, their former territories were taken up by other peoples who did get reserves and status rights, which were denied to the Lamalcha (see the Lamalcha War section on the Hwlitsum article). Political organization Their political organization, the Hwlitsum First Nation, is currently seeking legal recognition as a band government under the Indian Act, are in joint action with the Tsawwassen First Nation on mutual interests in the Fraser Estuary.

Methods of travel  The Lamalchi travelled primarily by canoe.Suttles 1987, p. 238.Miller 2014, p. 24. In September 1828, a European fur-trader counted 550 Cowichan canoes returning with fish along the Lower Fraser River.Egan 2008, p. 150.  Traditional territory  Closely-related groups of people occupied villages on Penelakut Island, Galiano Island, Valdez Island and the east coast of Vancouver Island. These groups identify themselves by the names of their winter villages such as Penelakut and Lamalcha among others.Arnett 1999, p. 21. “Lamalcha and Penelakut families controlled access to certain lands and resources on both sides of Trincomali Channel from Sqthaqa'l to Kulman, including the north end of Salt Spring Island from stulan on the west side to Shiyahwt on the east, and all of Galiano Island.”Arnett 1999, p. 21. The Lamalchi occupied “lands at Brunswick Point, Lamalcha Bay, portions of Salt Spring Island and Galiano Island, and elsewhere” to the exclusion of others.Miller 2014, p. 3. Up until contact in 1849 the Lamalchi usually spent November to March at Lamalcha Bay, and April to October at Hwlitsum (Canoe Pass). They also travelled to the Coquitlam River and Pitt River to harvest plants during the growing season.Miller 2014, p. 22-23.  Food  The Lamalchi and Penelakut were the only people who regularly hunted sea-lions around the south end of the Georgia Strait.Suttles 1987, p. 245. Fishing was a central and defining feature of the Lamalchi People.Miller 2014, p. 3. They fished at xegetinas (long beach) by Deas Island at the mouth of the Fraser River and shared the site with other Hul'qumi'num speaking communities.Miller 2014, p. 16. During their stay at the winter camp, they harvested “chum salmon, winter springs, oysters, clams, cockles, mussels, crab, cod, rock-cod, halibut, sole, red snapper, prawns, shrimp, cuttlefish (occasionally), sea urchins, kelp, sea weed, octopus, squid, herring, dogfish, and perch from local waters and beaches.”Miller 2014, p. 22. They also hunted deer, elk, black bear, raccoon, mink, seals, otter and grouse. They gathered salal, ferns, cedar bark, alder, maple, and berries for medicines and food. They were able to store food by smoking or drying it and storing it in boxes or bentwood boxes and caches.Miller 2014, p. 23. Spring, summer, and winter, food consisted of eulachon, spring salmon, coho salmon, sockeye salmon, steelhead, pink salmon, chum salmon, and sturgeon along with clams, crab, shrimp, halibut, ling cod, smelt, flounder, trout, and dogfish.Miller 2007, p. 131. They hunted “deer, mountain goat, black bear, muskrat, red fox, pheasant, mink, marten, ducks, geese, pigeon, widgeon, otter, seal, brant and snow geese.”Miller 2014, p. 22. Plants harvested were “cedar bark, cascara bark, devil's club, huckleberries, salmonberry, strawberry, salal, alder, maple, squasum berry, cattails, rhubarb, plums, crab apples, and wapato.”Miller 2014, p. 23.  Population  In 1824 Francis Annance estimated the population to be approximately 1,000.Maclachlan 1998, p. 172. In 1827 George Barnston estimated the collective population of the three largest Cowichan villages as approximately 1,500 people. This figure includes Somenos, and Quamichan of the Cowichan River and the Penelakuts (and Lamalchi) of Penelakut Island.Maclachlan 1998, p. 172. Barnston made this estimation from the deck of a ship while sailing past these communities. In 1849 an HBC employee recorded 122 people living in Lamalchi Bay.Miller 2014, p. 26.  Traditional houses  The Lamalchi traditionally lived in longhouses.Suttles 1987, p. 200.Arnett 1999, p. 21.Miller 2014, p. 14.

It was manufactured by Thales Alenia Space under the supervision of CNES, the Direction générale de l'armement (DGA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). It complements the lower-throughput but more secure Syracuse 3 satellites. The satellite has a wet mass of 3080 kg and was placed on geostationary orbit in 2014. Its expected lifetime is 15 years.  Manufacturing  The manufacturing contract was awarded in February 2010 to Thales Alenia Space. The satellite bus is a Spacebus 4000B2, smash in Cannes Mandelieu Space Center.  Launch  The satellite was launched by a Ariane 5 ECA rocket on 6 February 2014 during the VA217 mission. After some on-orbit tests, official satellite commissioning took place on 14 March 2014.  Payload  Although this is a common program, each country operates its own share of the payload. The satellite provides an encrypted, 3 Gbit/s throughput, using mostly Ka-band links. It carries 14 antennas including 7 mobile spot antennas, enabling positioning of steerable 1750-km diameter spot beams over operational theaters requiring a high bandwidth. France owns five beams and Italy, two. The system will enable communication with deployable ground stations (420 for France), and with drones.  Ground Segment  The ground segment for the French part of the capacity is called Comcept. Comcept will provide a network of fixed and deployable ground stations using full-IP (Internet Protocol) technology. The system includes high-data-rate (HDR) ground stations which are installed in a transportable shelter and provide a speed of approximately 10 Mbit/s. The Comcept system is provided by Airbus Defence and Space and Actia Sodielec.

Its features are especially connected to the ancient Neolithic cultures such as the Hongshan culture.Nelson, Matson, Roberts, Rock, Stencel. 2006. Chinese shamanic traditions are intrinsic to Chinese folk religion.Hong Zhang and Constantine Hriskos, Various ritual traditions are rooted in original Chinese shamanism: contemporary Chinese ritual masters are sometimes identified as wu by outsiders,Nadeau, 2012. p. 140 though most orders don't self-identify as such.

Meaning of wu A wu master The Chinese word wu \\"shaman, wizard\\", indicating a person who can mediate with the powers generating things (the etymological meaning of \\"spirit\\", \\"god\\", or nomen agentis, virtus, energeia), was first recorded during the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), when a wu could be either sex. During the late Zhou dynasty (1045-256 BCE) wu was used to specify \\"female shaman; sorceress\\" as opposed to xi \\"male shaman; sorcerer\\" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE Guoyu). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include nanwu for \\"male shaman; sorcerer; wizard\\"; and nüwu , wunü , wupo , and wuyu for \\"female shaman; sorceress; witch\\". The word tongji (lit. \\"youth diviner\\") \\"shaman; spirit-medium\\" is a near-synonym of wu. Modern Chinese distinguishes native wu from \\"Siberian shaman\\": saman or saman ; and from Indian Shramana \\"wandering monk; ascetic\\": shamen , sangmen , or sangmen . Berthold Laufer (1917:370) proposed an etymological relation between Mongolian bügä \\"shaman\\", Turkish bögü \\"shaman\\", Chinese bu, wu (shaman), buk, puk (to divine), and Tibetan aba (pronounced ba, sorcerer). Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root *' \\"magician; sorcerer\\" for Chinese wu < mju < *mjag \\"magician; shaman\\" and Written Tibetan 'ba'-po \\"sorcerer\\" and 'ba'-mo \\"sorcereress\\" (of the Bön religion). Further connections are to the bu-mo priests of Zhuang Shigongism and the bi-mo priests of Bimoism, the Yi indigenous faith. Also Korean mu (of Muism) is cognate to Chinese wu . Early history The Chinese religion from the Shang dynasty onwards developed around ancestral worship. The main gods from this period are not forces of nature in the Sumerian way, but deified virtuous men. The ancestors of the emperors were called di (), and the greatest of them was called Shangdi (, \\"the Highest Lord\\"). He is identified with the dragon (Kui ), symbol of the universal power (qi). Cosmic powers dominate nature: the Sun, the Moon, stars, winds and clouds were considered informed by divine energies. The earth god is She () or Tu (). The Shang period had two methods to enter in contact with divine ancestors: the first is the numinous-mystical wu () practice, involving dances and trances; and the second is the method of the oracle bones, a rational way. The Zhou dynasty, succeeding the Shang, was more rooted in an agricultural worldview. They opposed the ancestor-gods of the Shang, and gods of nature became dominant. The utmost power in this period was named Tian (, \\"heaven\\"). With Di (, \\"earth\\") he forms the whole cosmos in a complementary duality.  Qing period  The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty (1636–1912) introduced substantial elements of Tungusic shamanism to China. Hong Taiji (1592–1643) put shamanistic practices in the service of the state, notably by forbidding others to erect new shrines (tangse) for ritual purposes. In the 1620s and 1630s, the Qing ruler conducted shamanic sacrifices at the tangse of Mukden, the Qing capital. In 1644, as soon as the Qing seized Beijing to begin their conquest of China, they named it their new capital and erected an official shamanic shrine there. In the Beijing tangse and in the women's quarters of the Forbidden City, Qing emperors and professional shamans (usually women) conducted shamanic ceremonies until the abdication of the dynasty in 1912. In 1747 the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796) commissioned the publication of a Shamanic Code to revive and regulate shamanic practices, which he feared were becoming lost. He had it distributed to Bannermen to guide their practice, but we know very little about the effect of this policy. Mongols and Han Chinese were forbidden to attend shamanic ceremonies. Partly because of their secret aspect, these rituals attracted the curiosity of Beijing dwellers and visitors to the Qing capital. French Jesuit Joseph-Marie Amiot published a study on the Shamanic Code, \\"\\" (1773). In 1777 the Qianlong Emperor ordered the code translated into Chinese for inclusion in the Siku quanshu. The Manchu version was printed in 1778, whereas the Chinese-language edition, titled Qinding Manzhou jishen jitian dianli (), was completed in 1780 or 1782.di Cosmo, Nicola (1999), \\"Manchu shamanic ceremonies at the Qing court\\", in McDermott, Joseph P. (ed.), State and Court Ritual in China, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 355, note 5 (Manchu text printed in 1778, Chinese text completed in 1782); Rawski, Evelyn S. (1998), The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions, p. 240 (Chinese text completed in 1780). Even though this \\"Shamanic Code\\" did not fully unify shamanic practice among the Bannermen, it \\"helped systematize and reshape what had been a very fluid and diverse belief system.\\" Rawski, Evelyn S. (1998), The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions, p. 298\\"  Northeast shamanism  Shamanism is practiced in Northeast China and is considered different from those of central and southern Chinese folk religion, as it resulted from interaction of Han religion with folk religion practices of other Tungustic people such as Manchu shamanism. The shaman would perform various ritual functions for groups of believers and local communities, such as moon drum dance and chūmǎxiān (出馬仙 \\"riding for the immortals\\").

Founding Golden Harvest Seeds members included Akin Seed, Columbiana Seed, Garwood Seed, Golden Seed, J.C. Robinson Seeds, Sommer Bros. Seed, and Thorp Seed. Akin Seed left the partnership early, while Columbiana Seed was purchased by SeedTec following bankruptcy; the remaining five members continued as Golden Harvest until it ceased to exist as an independent entity. In 2001, J.C. Robinson Seeds, the largest of the five remaining members, was sued by the smaller four. The lawsuit was prompted by J.C. Robinson Seeds' expressed interest in exiting the Golden Harvest association. While the lawsuit was quickly dismissed in favor of J.C. Robinson, J.C. Robinson nevertheless did not leave the relationship. In 2003, J.C. Robinson Seeds purchased a controlling interest in the Dutch company Zelder, adding its corn-related activities to the Golden Harvest group. In 2004, Golden Harvest and Garst were acquired by Syngenta.

The is a fictitious being that originated on the Internet as a Japanese urban legend. First mentioned on websites in 2003, the Kunekune is typically described as having a slender, white, paper- or fabric-like humanoid shape, and is usually said to appear in fields on hot summer days. Its name, Kunekune, is derived from its alleged behavior of wiggling its limbs. Explanations for the Kunekune include its appearances being the result of confusion with scarecrows or wick drains.  Description  The Kunekune is said to resemble a slender, white humanoid shape, like a paper mannequin or a piece of fine fabric. It is said that the being can be found at lunchtime during hot summer days. The Kunekune lingers in widely extended rice fields or acres, in rare cases it might be found over the open sea. Its limbs are said to wiggle permanently, as if there was a straight gust of wind, even if it was a windless day. This behaviour gave the being the Japanese name \\"Kunekune\\", meaning \\"to twist\\", \\"to wiggle\\" or \\"to meander\\".Richard Freeman: The Great Yokai Encyclopaedia: The A-Z of Japanese Monsters. CFZ Press, Myrtle Cottage, Bideford 2010, , p. 200.Yamaguchi Satoshi Taro: 本当にいる日本の「現代妖怪」図鑑. Ryukura Verlag, Tokyo 2007, , p. 19-23.Ito Ryuhei: 「ネット怪談「くねくね. In: 世間話研究, 18. Ausgabe. Smalltalk Study Group, Kyoto 2008, p. 55-57. The Kunekune allegedly can only become visible from a distance; witnesses may see field workers or others closer to a Kunekune who do not seem to be aware of it. In some variations, if an individual tries to look at it up close, they will go insane. In other versions, if someone touches it, or simply comes too close, the Kunekune will kill them. If someone does not approach or make contact with the Kunekune, it is said that the Kunekune will ignore them.  Background  First mention of the Kunekune appeared in 2003 at several websites at the same time. These websites deal with made-up stories concerning ghosts, demons and other kinds of spooks. Soon after the first published reports, Kunekune- believers began to write and collect their own (mostly made up) stories. These are all written in the first person singular in an attempt to make them look like eyewitness reports. A similar phenomenon can be observed with the case of the Slender Man and with Hanako-san. The appearance of the Kunekune may be the result of confusion with traditional scarecrows, which are found in fields of rice and barley, or , or snake worship like or misinterpretation of a wick drains planted to drain water from inner ground to robust the soft ground. Another possible explanation might be thick fog clouds, which appear over the fields during lunchtime. A third possibility might be hallucinations, created by heat stroke and dehydration during hot summer days.

There are 120,250 Chinese people in London, comprising 1.5% of the city's population. 33% of ethnic Chinese people in the United Kingdom reside in London. As of 2000, more recent ethnic Chinese arrivals originated from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Vietnam while historically Chinese had migrated from Hong Kong, including the urbanised areas and the New Territories; Singapore; Malaysia; and elsewhere in southeast Asia.Eade, 73. History John Eade, the author of Placing London: From Imperial Capital to Global City, stated that a Chinese community representative stated that in the 1780s Chinese sailors visited London, being the first Chinese to visit London. In the latter half of the 1800s the first wave of Chinese immigrants came to London. Chinese lived in Soho by the time World War II occurred. Since Hong Kong was a British territory, many Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong as well as Macau (which were, and still are, very similar in terms of economy and geography) were either brought over or travelled to London and subsequently the rest of the U.K. Another wave of Chinese immigration occurred in London during the 1950s and 1960s. The London economy prompted Chinese from many places to move, while changes in international rice markets prompted some Chinese from the New Territories of Hong Kong to move to London. During the same era, many Chinese moved from Whitehall to Soho. In the 1970s and 1980s many Chinese working in Soho continued to work there but began moving to suburbs. Non-Chinese began replacing the Chinese in Soho in the 1980s.Eade, p. 74. As of the late 1980s Soho remained the centre of the London Chinese community.Eade, p. 75.

The vote, known also as the \\"digital plebiscite\\" or \\"Plebiscito.eu\\", was promoted by Plebiscite 2013, a Venetian nationalist organisation led by Gianluca Busato. Background Turnout and results According to Plebiscito.eu's staff, 2.36 million Venetians (63.2% of all eligible voters) participated in the online referendum and 89.1% of them (that is to say 56.6% of all eligible voters) voted \\"yes\\" to independence. P2013 proclaimed Veneto's independence from Italy in Treviso on the night of 21 March. In the poll, ten \\"delegates for independence\\" were elected: Busato was the preferred candidate with 135,306 votes, followed by Stefano Vescovi (48,320), Selena Veronese (46,947), Silvia Gandin (43,025), Lodovico Pizzati (25,731), Gianfranco Favaro (16,670), Raffaele Serafini (16,627), Manuel Carraro (16,627), Gianluca Panto (16,321) and Paolo Bernardini (16,299). Finally, voters were asked to express their opinion on three \\"foreign policy issues\\", were Veneto to become independent: adoption of the Euro (supported by 51.4% of voters), accession to European Union membership (supported by 55.7% of voters) and accession to NATO membership (supported by 64.5% of voters); turnout was however much lower for these three questions (24.6%, 22.3% and 19.8%, respectively). Critique of turnout and results Turnout and results were questioned by many news sources based on publicly available website traffic statistics released by Alexa Internet and similar providers. According to the critics, throughout the duration of the poll, the website received approximately 135,000 visits (just 3.6% of eligible voters). Moreover, a significant proportion of this traffic came from outside Italy, with 10% coming from Santiago, Chile alone. According to an opinion poll by Ilvo Diamanti's DemosΠ for La Repubblica taken on 20–21 March, however, 48% of Venetians had voted or had intention to vote in the online referendum, 49% had not voted, and 3% did not answer. Among those voting, 78% favoured independence. Moreover, Diamanti found that 55% of all eligible voters favoured independence, which was opposed by 39%. Other polling firms, including Ixè and Istituto Piepoli, offered comparable data. Plebiscito.eu, for its part, announced on 29 March that a short report on the referendum by a committee of international observers would be soon presented. The president of the committee, former ambassador of Georgia to Italy, Beglar Davit Tavartkiladze, anticipated that 100% of the voters who had been contacted confirmed to have voted. In 2014 and 2015, the Plebiscito.eu organizers asserted that the result of the referendum was legitimate and that the Plebiscito.eu referendum committee was entitled to \\"establish any form of relationship with states and intergovernmental organizations in order to recognise referendum results and therefore the full independence of the Venetian Republic.\\" Reactions and aftermath Several international media covered the event. During an interview with foreign journalists on 19 March 2014, Luca Zaia, President of Veneto and leading member of Liga Veneta–Lega Nord, announced that he too had voted (yes) in the online poll and explained that he would seek \\"total independence\\" for Veneto. On 1 April 2014 a committee of the Regional Council of Veneto put forward bills calling for a referendum on independence and on more autonomy for the region. The move was supported by the representatives of Liga Veneta–Lega Nord, Forza Italia (the minority faction), New Centre-Right, Popular Future, Union of the Centre and North-East Union, but opposed by the Democratic Party, Italy of Values and the Federation of the Left. The day after, all the floor leaders of the parties represented in the council (except for the Federation of the Left) officially asked the Italian government to give Veneto the status of a special-statute autonomous region and fiscal autonomy. The final document was approved by Liga Veneta–Lega Nord, Forza Italia (both factions), New Centre Right, Union of the Centre, Italy of Values and North-East Union. On 28 April, during a visit to Veneto, the Italian Minister of the Interior, Angelino Alfano, acknowledged that \\"there is a Venetian question, which will be central in the government's relation with regions\\". In reference to what he called \\"Agenda Veneto\\", he said: > \\"We think that Veneto could be the laboratory for a form of strong and > advanced federalism. [...] We cannot close our eyes in front of > independentist risings. [...] The answer is dual: enhancing autonomy and > improving the government's services\\". For his part, Zaia explained to Alfano the \\"legitimate request of Venetians\\" for autonomy and independence, and that \\"the issue of autonomy and the desire of independence of Venetians cannot be resolved with an aspirin\\", concluding that \\"if Rome continues to sleep, it is inevitable that Veneto will organise by itself\\". On 10 June the Regional Council discussed and passed a law concerning five referendum questions concerning special autonomy. On 12 June the same legislative assembly passed Valdegamberi's 342/2013 bill in order to hold a referendum on the independence (question: \\"Do you want Veneto to become a sovereign and independent republic?\\") with 30 yeas, 12 nays and 3 abstentions. On 26 June 2015 the Constitutional Court ruled the independence referendum out as contrary to the Constitution, but authorised one of the five autonomy referenda (\\"Do you want the Region of Veneto to be granted of further and special forms and conditions of autonomy?\\"). In March 2016 President Zaia announced that he had written to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in order to start negotiating both on the organisation of the referendum on autonomy and on the devolution of further powers to Veneto according to article 116 of the Constitution. Zaia proposed holding the referendum on the same day as the 2016 constitutional referendum (which would reduce the regions' powers—article 117, while expanding the powers that can be devolved to regions according to article 116 and creating a regionalised Senate), a notion deemed legally impossible by undersecretary Gianclaudio Bressa, and the negotiations started in May. According to an opinion poll taken in June, 78.5% of Venetians would take part in an autonomy referendum, 78.4% would vote yes, 3.5% no and 18.1% did not know. According to the same poll, 70.7% of voters would participate also in the constitutional referendum, 41.3% would vote yes, 22.2% no and 36.5% did not know. Contextually, two bills calling for an independence referendum were introduced in the Regional Council, one by Liga Veneta's Marino Finozzi, Gabriele Michieletto, Alessandro Montagnoli and Luciano Sandonà, with the support of Roberto Ciambetti (President of the Council), and the other by Antonio Guadagnini.

The Kerch Strait ferry line (, ) was a ferry connection across the Strait of Kerch that connected the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Krai. The ferry ran across the narrowest part of the strait (about 5 km) between Port Krym (harbour Crimea) by the city of Kerch and Port Kavkaz (harbour Caucasus) on the Chushka Spit, on the site of former Kerch railway bridge. It carried passengers, automotive and railroad transport. The ferry was on the European route E97 and connected its parts, А290 (formerly M25) and М-17 highways. After the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, ferry traffic peaked, but as the Crimean Bridge across the strait opened in 2018-2020, it overtook the traffic flow from the ferry, rendering its usage for transportation financially unfeasible, so the ferry line stopped operations in late 2020. History The ferry line was established in 1953, on the site of the former Kerch railway bridge. From 1993 to 2004 railroad transportation was suspended due to replacement of aged train-ferries. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was administered by Russia and Ukraine through the joint venture “Crimea-Kuban Crossing”. In 1998, this company was reorganized into a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise \\"Kerch Strait ferry line\\". On 17 March 2014, during the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the company was nationalised by the Republic of Crimea, and had been since administered by Russia only. The use of the ferry rose sharply after the annexation, and in June 2015, the ferry operator considered a daily passenger count of 11,000 normal. The 2018 opening of the road section of the new Crimean Bridge, crossing the strait about 10 km further south, had greatly reduced demand for the ferry. In Autumn 2019 it was announced that ferry stopped operations as financially unfeasible with then-current amounts of passenger and freight traffic. While occasional ferries were still used for rail freight transportation, opening of the rail bridge across the strait overtook that last remaining traffic, and at the end of September 2020 the ferry line was closed, with the last train ferry shipping taking place on 28 September 2020.

Previous People  The very first voice heard at 6h00 on 31 May 2003 was Pieter Rischmuller (on loan from Radio Pretoria), who at the time was asked to assist the station until it found its feet. After that various presenters from the community were part of the different shows on the radio: James Williams (also the first program manager and sound technician of the station), Martin Jansen (first station manager), Jan Prinsloo, Lappies Labuschagne (later acting-station manager), Denis Wales, Bokkie Taute, Bez Bezuidenhout, Andri Roodt, Charles Gentle, Gert Booysen (also station manager), Endria Stronkhorst, Adam Van Deventer, Cindy Labuschagne (first teen-presenter), Dennis Wales, Sarie Saayman, Jannie vd Berg, Giep Van Zyl, Franswa Eloff, Theresa Schoeman, Jeanne Steyn, t.b.c.  History  It all started when the need for a local community radio station, focused on Afrikaans culture and language in the Lowveld of Mpumalanga was identified by a group like minded people known as 'Die Verkenners'. The idea was spearheaded, around two years before the license was awarded, by Albertus Van Zijl (a local business man and lawyer), who also later became the first Chairman. At that stage the frequency 100.5FM was in use by Radio Pretoria who were broadcasting from Pretoria. Negotiations centered around the fostering of Afrikaans language, believes and culture in the Lowveld through this broadcasting service. The original studios were in the Whiteriver Centre (from 31 May 2003 to 30 September 2005) and later moved to Nelspruit (1 August 2005) in the Sonpark centre (where it currently still is).

Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti is one of the most influential Sufi in India and is credited with spreading of Islam in the Indian subcontinent. When Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti reached India, he found the local society to be poisoned by untouchability. So he decided to organize a langar (public eating of food together irrespective of status, sex, religion and caste). This langar brought people into influence of Islam and its strict stand against untouchability.

It is located between Atmata and Skirvytė, distributaries of the Neman River, and the Curonian Lagoon. At 45 or 46 square kilometers, Rusnė is often named as the largest island of Lithuania.Rusnės salos gyventojai: „Mums užuojautos nereikia“ Geography The island’s age has been estimated at 1,100 years. It was formed when the Neman River deposited its sediments before flowing into the Curonian Lagoon (see alluvial plain). Therefore, its elevation does not exceed 1.5 metres. One point in the island is 0.27 metres below sea level, which is the lowest point in Lithuania (an earlier measurement placed it at 1.3 metres below sea level). The island is subject to frequent flooding, particularly in spring due to ice dams. Floods and regular river flow deposit new sediments increasing the area of the island. Floodwaters are removed by pumping, using an extensive system of canals and polders. The polder and embankment system has not always been able to contain floods such as the one in 1958. The island contains several distributaries of the rivers Atmata and Skirvytė (Pakalnė, Vorusnė, Skatulė, Rusnaitė, etc.). In addition, it has two rivulets (Naikupė and Ulmas) that are not part of the distributary system.Hidrografinis tinklas Its natural values are protected by its inclusion within Nemunas Delta Regional Park. Human history Recorded history includes its settlement by fishermen and subsequent Livonian Order control. Its location near the junction of the Nemunas and the Baltic Sea lent it some strategic importance as a point on trade routes and during the battles for control of Samogitia. A church in the town of Rusnė dates to 1419. The main businesses in the island are sailing, canoeing tourism, and fishing. The town of Rusnė, with 1,600 inhabitants, is the largest populated place on the island. The only bridge between the mainland and the island leads to Rusnė. The first bridge was completed in 1914 but was destroyed during World War II. The current bridge was built in 1974.Architektūros vertybės Rusnė Island Cultural and Information Office operates in Rusnė. After Lithuania re- established its independence in 1990, collective farming on the island ended and individual landowners lacked the resources to use the machinery needed to clear the fields. This led to the growth of vegetation that was inhospitable to migratory birds, an internationally problematic issue since the island lies within the East Atlantic Flyway. An NGO, The Lithuanian Fund for Nature, successfully spearheaded a drive to restore the meadows that had been used by various bird species. The initiative was supported by local farmers.

The character is depicted usually as an antagonist to the Hulk. Created by writer Peter David and artist Dale Keown, the character first appeared in The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2, #377 (January 1991) as a malevolent representation of Bruce Banner's abusive father Brian Banner that manifests itself in Banner's childhood memories.  Fictional character history  Guilt Hulk's original appearance in The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2, #377. Art by Dale Keown. A malevolent alternate personality of Bruce Banner, the Guilt Hulk embodies all of Bruce's guilt, shame, and regrets. Existing within Bruce's mind, the entity seeks to manifest and run amok in the real world. In the 1991 storyline in which the Guilt Hulk first appears, Doc Samson employs the Ringmaster's expertise with hypnosis in an attempt to unify Banner's fractured mental state. This allows Banner to experience aspects of his own mind, including childhood memories, from both an objective and participatory viewpoint. During these hypnosis sessions, Banner interacts with his warring split personalities, the Savage Hulk and Joe Fixit. The Guilt Hulk interferes with the treatment, tormenting Bruce and the Hulks by replacing Bruce's abusive father Brian in traumatic memories. By confronting the source of his mental illness, Banner is able to banish the Guilt Hulk, and cause the emergence of the Professor, a more stable personality initially assumed to be a fusion of Banner, the Savage Hulk, and Fixit. The Guilt Hulk, possessing a slightly altered appearance, returns years later as Banner is dying of Lou Gehrig's Disease. Empowered by the dying Bruce blaming himself for the death of Betty Ross, the Guilt Hulk tries to overtake Banner's mind, a process made easier for it due to the other Hulks being suppressed by Banner. Using a machine created by neuroscientist Angela Lipscombe, Banner enters his own subconscious, and frees Fixit and the Professor, though the two are outmatched by the Guilt Hulk until Banner seeks the aid of the Savage Hulk. Together, the three manage to overpower the Guilt Hulk. When Brian Banner is released from Hell during the 2010-2011 \\"Chaos War\\" storyline, he becomes a fusion of the Guilt Hulk and the Devil Hulk. Powers and abilities While the Guilt Hulk has not manifested in the real world, in Banner's mind it was enormous in size, possessed claws and fangs, and was capable of fending off two other Hulks. In its debut, the Guilt Hulk was covered in spikes, could breathe fire, and torture Banner and the other personalities through Banner's memories. Other versions In an issue of \\"What If?,\\" Banner's initial confrontation with the Guilt Hulk ends with him \\"killing\\" the entity himself which leads to him gradually transforming into Maestro.

The film chronicles the story of Linda Abdul Aziz Menuhin, an Israeli citizen who fled her native Iraq in the 1970s, and her connection with a young Iraqi journalist who reaches out to her in an effort to help her trace the disappearance of her father in Iraq shortly after she fled the country. The film takes place between Israel, Iraq and Jordan. The film was first released in Haifa Film Festival and was one of the reasons that led to the rise of public interest in Israel and around world, in the story of the disappearance of Jews from Arab lands. The film was screened in the US Library of Congress in Washington with the opening of the exhibition of the Iraqi Jewish Archive in the National Archive. Synopsis Shadow in Baghdad opens with Menuhin, a freelance journalist for Arabic-language news outlets, crossing from Israel into Jordan in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to vote in Iraq's 2010 presidential elections. Though Menuhin begins the day optimistic about her ability to participate in the elections as an Iraqi, she is held by the Iraqi authorities at the poll station until the Jordanian security services intervene. Upon returning to Israel, Menuhin blogs about her experiences in Jordan and is then contacted by an Iraqi journalist who takes interest in her story and that of her father, Yaakoub Abdul Aziz, who disappeared in Iraq decades earlier. As the connection between the two journalists deepen, they delve further and further into Menuhin's past, as well as that of the Iraqi-Jewish community, in an attempt to find clues as to what may have happened to her father. As the two struggle to pick up traces of her father, the Iraqi journalist takes to the streets of Baghdad, combing the Al Musbah district where Menuhin once lived with her family. Meanwhile, in Israel, Menuhin also pays visits to former members of the Iraqi-Jewish community of Baghdad, those who knew her father before themselves fleeing for Israel, to try and better understand the circumstances under which her father would have disappeared.

Oscar Whisky's dam, Ash Baloo won once from nine starts in National Hunt races in 1998 and 1999. She was a direct female-line descendant of Fifinella, a filly who won the Derby and the Oaks in 1916. In November 2006, Oscar Whisky (who had already been gelded) was sent as a yearling to the Tattersalls Ireland sale and was bought for €36,000 by Oak Tree Farm. The gelding returned to the sales in June 2008 when he was bought for €80,000 by Dai Walters at the Goffs Land Rover Sale. Oscar Whisky raced in the colours of his owner's business Walters Plant Hire Ltd. He was trained throughout his racing career by Nicky Henderson at Lambourn in Berkshire and was ridden in all but one of his races by Barry Geraghty. Racing career =2009/2010 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races and Novice hurdles= Oscar Whisky began his racing career in a National Hunt Flat race over one and a half miles at Newbury Racecourse on 21 March 2009. He started favourite in a field of sixteen four- year-olds and won \\"very easily\\" by nine lengths. After an eight-month break, the gelding returned in a two-mile National Hunt Flat race at Newbury in November. Starting the 8/15 favourite, he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by four lengths from Midnight Prayer, with the future Champion Hurdle winner Rock On Ruby in fourth place. A month later at the same course, Oscar Whisky made his debut over obstacles in a novice hurdle race. He was made the 4/11 favourite against thirteen opponents and won \\"effortlessly\\" by seven lengths. Oscar Whisky was prepared for the 2010 Cheltenham Festival with a very easy win in a novice hurdle at Sandown, beating ten opponents at odds of 4/11. At Cheltenham on 16 March 2010, Oscar Whisky started the 11/1 third favourite for the Grade I Supreme Novices' Hurdle and finished fourth of the eighteen runners behind Menorah, Get Me Out of Here and Dunguib. =2010/2011 National Hunt season= Oscar Whisky was off the racecourse for over eight months before reappearing in a hurdle race at Cheltenham on 1 January 2011. Racing against more experienced opponents, he took the lead approaching the last hurdle and accelerated clear in the closing stages to win by seven lengths from Any Given Day, with Celestial Halo six lengths further back in third. Five weeks later, he started 2/7 favourite for the Welsh Champion Hurdle at Ffos Las Racecourse and won easily by eight lengths. On his second appearance at the Cheltenham Festival, Oscar Whisky, having won six of his seven races, started the 7/1 fourth favourite for the 2011 Champion Hurdle. He took the lead at the second last hurdle but was soon overtaken and finished third behind Hurricane Fly and Peddlers Cross. Further back in the field were Thousand Stars, Menorah, Overturn, Dunguib and Khyber Kim. In April, Oscar Whisky was moved up in distance for the Grade I Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles at Aintree Racecourse and started at odds of 6/1 in a field which included Peddlers Cross, Menorah, Thouand Stars, Celestial Halo and the 2010 Champion Hurdle winner Binocular. Geraghty tracked the leader Celestial Halo before taking the lead at the seventh of the eleven hurdles and opened up a three length lead at the last obstacle. In the closing stages Oscar Whisky held off a strong challenge from Thousand Stars to win by a neck, with a gap of ten lengths back to the outsider Salden Licht in third place. Barry Geraghty said: \\"He was very game. The plan was just to track Peddlers Cross. He came alive down the back, he winged it down there and I was just happy to go with it\\". =2011/2012 National Hunt season= On his first appearance of the 2011/2012 National Hunt season, Oscar Whisky was made 5/6 favourite for the Grade II Ascot Hurdle in November, but fell heavily when challenging Overturn for the lead at the last obstacle. In December he was again made odds-on favourite when he contested the Grade II Relkeel Hurdle at Cheltenham. He raced in third place before moving up to take the lead after the penultimate hurdle and won by one and three quarter lengths from Get Me Out of Here. After the race Henderson said \\"He jumped beautifully all the way, he got racing quite early – I know Barry wanted to hold on a bit longer but I suspect they didn't go a great gallop early. He was racing two out and he's quickened up nicely. That is a good trip for him\\". On 1 January, over the same course and distance he won again, beating his three opponents \\"very easily\\" at odds of 4/6. In his final preparation race for the Cheltenham Festival Oscar Whisky contested a two-mile flat race on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse. The race was run on National Hunt rules and he won very easily from six opponents at odds of 1/16. On 15 March, Oscar Whisky was moved up in distance to contest the World Hurdle over three miles at Cheltenham. He was made the 4/1 second favourite behind Big Buck's, who was attempting to win the race for the fourth consecutive year. He tracked the favourite for much of the race but weakened in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Big Buck's, beaten thirteen lengths by the winner. In April, Oscar Whisky was matched against the 2012 Champion Hurdler Rock On Ruby and the 2011 Triumph Hurdle winner Zarkandar as he attempted to win his second Aintree Hurdle. He tracked the leader Rock On Ruby before taking the lead after the second last. As in 2011, Thousand Stars emerged as his most serious challenger, and as in the previous year, Oscar Whisky prevailed by a neck after a prolonged struggle. =2012/2013 National Hunt season= Oscar Whisky began the next season in the Ascot Hurdle and won easily by eight lengths from Raya Star, having led from the start. Only two horses appeared to oppose him in the Relkeel Hurdle, and he had no difficulty repeating his 2011 success in the race, leading all the way and finishing nineteen lengths clear of Crack Away Jack. In the Cleeve Hurdle over three miles at Cheltenham in January Geraghty adopted different tactics, restraining the gelding at the rear of the field before moving up to make his challenge at the last hurdle. Although he stayed on well in the closing stages, Oscar Whisky failed to overhaul the leader Reve de Sivola and was beaten a neck. In March 2013, Oscar Whisky ran for the third time at the Cheltenham Festival. He started the 9/4 favourite for the World Hurdle but began to struggle four hurdles from the finish and was tailed off when Geraghty pulled him up at the penultimate flight. In April, he attempted to win his third consecutive Aintree Hurdle in which he was ridden by A. P. McCoy, with Geraghty partnering the Henderson stables other runner Grandouet. Starting at odds of 5/1, he finished fourth behind Zarkandar, The New One and Thousand Stars. =2013/2014 National Hunt season: Novice chases= In the 2013/2014 National Hunt season, Oscar Whisky was campaigned in novice chases. He made his debut over the larger obstacles at Cheltenham on 15 November when he stated the 4/6 favourite but was beaten a neck by the Jonjo O'Neill-trained six-year-old Taquin de Seuil in a race which was run at very slow pace and resulted in a sprint finish. Four week later at the same course, he was matched against Wonderful Charm, a French-bred horse who had won the Rising Stars Novices' Chase and the Berkshire Novices' Chase. Oscar Whisky led from the start and beat Wonderful Charm by half length to record his first steeplechase victory. The Dipper Novices' Chase at Cheltenham on 1 January saw a rematch between Oscar Whisky and Taquin de Seuil. The race was run on very soft ground which led to six of the seventeen fences being omitted for safety reasons. Oscar Whisky took the lead before the last fence and held off a challenge from Taquin de Seuil to win by three quarters of a length. Only two horses turned out to oppose Oscar Whisky in the Grade I Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown on 1 February. Starting at odds of 1/6 he did not jump well but took the lead at the last and drew away in the closing stages to win by nine lengths. Commenting on what was described as a rather disappointing performance, Henderson suggested that the horse had not been suited by the soft ground and added, \\"He's a stuffy devil, that's why he had to have a run. He was having a great old heave in here [the winner's enclosure]. But I know what he's like\\". On 13 March, Oscar Whisky started 9/2 second favourite for the Grade I JLT Novices' Chase at the Cheltenham Festival but fell at the first fence. At Aintree a month later he started 7/4 favourite for the Grade I Manifesto Novices' Chase and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths by the French-bred six-year-old Uxizandre. =2014/2015 National Hunt season: Steeplechases= On his first appearance of the 2014/2015 National Hunt season Oscar Whisky was assigned top weight of 166 pounds in the Paddy Power Gold Cup over two and a half miles at Cheltenham on 15 November. Starting at odds of 6/1 in an eighteen-runner field he recovered from a bump at the third last and finished well to take fourth place, two and a quarter lengths behind the winner Cead du Berlais. Oscar Whisky was then brought back in distance to contest the Grade I Tingle Creek Trophy at Sandown on 6 December. Ridden as usual by Geraghty, he was towards the rear of the ten runner field when falling at the sixth fence. Although the horse got up to his feet after the fall he had sustained a serious hind leg injury and was euthanised shortly afterwards. Geraghty paid tribute to the horse saying \\"He was a warrior. He was so brave, reliable and honest, and he'd never miss a day\\".

It developed on 8 March, 2014, in the Gulf of Carpentaria offshore northern Australia. It drifted southeastward, moving over northwestern Queensland on 10 March as a weak tropical cyclone, and subsequently turned to the southwest and later to the west. Unfavourable wind shear, land interaction, and dry air prevented much restrengthening, and for several days Gillian was a weak tropical low. The storm moved northward and curved westward around the Top End of northwestern Australia, and subsequently moved across several islands in Indonesia, first Timor on 18 March. On 21 March, Gillian again became a tropical cyclone as it moved away from Indonesia. On the next day, it passed just southeast of Christmas Island as an intensifying storm, and subsequently Gillian underwent rapid deepening. On 23 March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph), making it a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Increased wind shear caused the cyclone to rapidly weaken, and both BoM and JTWC discontinued advisories on Gillian on 26 March. The cyclone affected northern Australia with gusty winds and some rainfall, while on the Indonesian island of Java, it produced strong waves. While moving near Christmas Island, Gillian downed thousands of trees and damaged the roof of one of the oldest buildings on the island. Winds gusted to , making it the first cyclone to affect Christmas Island in six years. The storm also affected the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Meteorological history The origins of Gillian were from a weak tropical low that persisted in the eastern Arafura Sea on 6 March. The next day, the system moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, where it developed convection, or thunderstorms, which organised into curved rainbands. The thunderstorms were located west of a circulation, was exposed due to moderate wind shear. At 06:00 UTC on 8 March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Darwin began issuing warnings on the developing tropical low. Around that time, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), indicated the high potential for tropical cyclogenesis due to the increasingly organised circulation and convection. At 09:00 UTC on 8 March, the BoM upgraded the low to Tropical Cyclone Gillian, and six hours later, the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17P. After its formation, Gillian moved slowly southward toward Queensland within an area of weak steering currents. Despite ongoing wind shear, forecasters anticipated strengthening due to warm water temperatures and favourable outflow. The storm turned more toward the southeast due to the influence of a ridge to the northeast. Early on 10 March, Gillian made landfall along the western Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, after weakening below tropical cyclone status. Cyclone Gillian approaching Cape York Peninsula on 8 March A strengthening ridge to the south turned the storm to the southwest, bringing Gillian back over water; however, the circulation became poorly-defined and the convection decreased due to land interaction. Early on 11 March the JTWC discontinued advisories. When Gillian was downgraded to a tropical low, the proximity to land and continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment. The system tracked westward through the Gulf of Carpentaria due to the ridge to the south, passing just north of Mornington Island on 12 March. The next day, the convection reorganised as the circulation became better defined. On 14 March, the JTWC again assessed a high potential for Gillian redeveloping into a tropical cyclone, noting the appearance of a central dense overcast. At 06:00 UTC on the same day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status in the central Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to a weak trough in the region, the storm turned to the northeast. Increasing wind shear again caused the storm to lose organisation early on 15 March, prompting the BoM to downgrade Gillian to a tropical low. Dry air prevented the convection from initially reorganising after Gillian was downgraded. With a ridge to the south, the low turned westward around the Top End of northwestern Australia. On 17 March, the system moved north of 10° S, into the area of warning responsibility of the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics. By that time, the low-level circulation was disconnected from its mid-level circulation, and land interaction with Indonesia was expected to prevent redevelopment. Late on 18 March, the storm moved over the island of Timor, and over the subsequent two days passed over several other Indonesian islands. On 21 March, the convection reorganised due to a drop in wind shear, and at 12:00 UTC that day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status while the storm was about 380 km (235 mi) south-southeast of Jakarta. On the same day, the JTWC also re- initiated advisories on the storm, noting that the circulation had improved as it moved away from Indonesia. With low wind shear and favourable outflow, Gillian gradually intensified while moving southwestward around the ridge. On 22 March, the storm passed just north of Christmas Island while Gillian was developing an eye; by that time, the 10 minute sustained winds had increased to 95 km/h (60 mph) within an environment favourable for continued strengthening. At 12:00 UTC on 22 March, the BoM upgraded the storm to a Category 3 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale with 10 minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), the equivalent of a minimal hurricane; a few hours later, the JTWC followed suit. The cyclone continued to rapidly intensify, with a well-defined anticyclone providing good outflow and very low wind shear. At 12:00 UTC on 23 March, the BoM estimated Gillian attained peak 10 minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), making it a Category 5 on the Australian scale, while located about 1000 km (620 mi) south-southwest of Jakarta; the agency also estimated peak gusts of 285 km/h (180 mph). At 18:00 UTC on 23 March, the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). By that time, the eye had contracted to a diameter of 22 km (14 mi), but was beginning to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle. In addition, Gillian was experiencing increased wind shear due to an approaching trough, indicative of weakening. It continued around the ridge and turned more to the south over open waters well to the west of Western Australia. The eye became less distinct, and early on 25 March Gillian weakened below Category 3 intensity on the Australian scale. On the same day, the JTWC also downgraded the cyclone to tropical storm strength, noting the storm's rapid weakening corresponded to a decline in Dvorak numbers - a system to estimate intensity via satellites. The circulation became exposed from the convection, and BoM downgraded Gillian to a tropical low on 26 March, the same day that the JTWC discontinued advisories after the circulation began dissipating. Preparations and impact Cyclone Gillian near Christmas Island on 22 March Much of Far North Queensland was affected by rain for over a week as Gillian slowly moved through the Gulf of Carpentaria. The heaviest rains, averaging , fell along a corridor along southern part of the Cape York Peninsula from the Mitchell-Alice Rivers National Park to Cooktown. of rain from 9–15 March with gusts up to in Kowanyama, Queensland. On 17 March, Gillian brushed the Top End region, bringing only minor rainfall to coastal areas. Winds reached 45 km/h (30 mph) in the Wessel Islands. Across Java, Indonesia, the storm produced moderate to heavy rains. After re-intensifying into a tropical cyclone, swells of from the storm affected southern shores of the island. Though well to the north of Cyclone Gillian, the system's circulation drew moisture away from Riau western Indonesia, leaving behind fire-prone conditions. Due in part to illegal logging and slash-and-burn land clearing, several new forest fires began by 23 March. On 20 March, the BoM issued a cyclone watch for Christmas Island, and the next day upgraded it to a cyclone warning. The first cyclone to affect Christmas Island since Cyclone Rosie in 2008, Gillian approached the island as a category 2 system, causing light to moderate damage. Only one structure on the island, the Immigration Detention Centre, is constructed to cyclone- standards on the island. Island administrator Jon Stanhope stated that the 1,700 asylum seekers were likely safer than residents in permanent homes. Gale-force winds, peaking at , battered the island for 15 hours. Several homes lost their roof and one family had to be evacuated; however, most structures were left unscathed. The roof of the Rumah Tinggi Bar and Restaurant, one of the oldest buildings on the island, was torn off. Thousands of trees were reportedly downed across the island, with jungles sustaining significant losses, and there were power outages due to significant damage to the islands powerlines. Gillian also dropped of rainfall over a 24‑hour period on the island. On 23 March, several aircraft at Subang airport in Malaysia taking part in the 26-nation search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 were grounded due to inclement weather. It was noted that Gillian could hamper rescue efforts in the southern corridor search for the aircraft.

Plot  After East Coast businessman Jay Randolph Lattimore approves the designs for a new gymnasium he is donating, he discusses with his attorney and an associate how he has recently undergone a complete personality change: Susan, the widow of Lattimore's son Tom, who was killed in the war, confronts the gruff, bitter Lattimore with the news that she and her six-year-old daughter Joan will no longer be dependent upon him and are leaving his house to move to Miami, where she believes she can resume her modeling career. Although Lattimore states he will not allow Susan to leave with his granddaughter, he later observes them as they say goodbye to the housekeeper and drive away. Early in the morning, on the outskirts of Tampa, Susan is confused by a detour in the highway, and the car breaks down in a remote area. Fortunately, another driver, Johnny Patterson, is on the road and attempts to fix the car. When he realizes a professional mechanic is required, he invites Susan and Joan to rest at the nearby Garden of Eden resort until a garage opens. After making them comfortable in a cabin at the \\"members only\\" resort, Johnny leaves to arrange to have the car worked on, but fails to advise Susan and Joan that they are in the middle of a nudist colony. Meanwhile, the abandoned car has been found by a Highway Patrol unit and Lattimore is advised. After a short nap, Susan awakens, looks out the cabin window and is surprised to see Joan, and other children, playing without any clothes on. Several naked adults also pass by. When Johnny returns to explain that he is arranging to have her car repaired, Susan tells him that she thinks that the children are delightfully natural naked, but is not convinced about the adults and decides to remain in the cabin until the car is ready. Johnny tells Susan that he is an actor and also works at the camp. Lattimore, meanwhile, receives a phone call from the police advising him that Susan and Joan are safe at the Garden of Eden, which he assumes is a motel. After Johnny discovers that the car repair will take several days, Susan, fully dressed, wanders outside to meet several of the nudists, including a theater director, who expresses an interest in her acting ability. Later, Joan asks her mother if she feels funny being the only person with clothes on. Susan is then invited by a male resident, naked from the waist up, to take a ride around the camp's lake in his motorboat. Susan asks to be dropped off on the other side of the lake, where she lays down, falls asleep and dreams of disrobing and swimming naked in the lake. In the dream, Johnny swims up to her, but she is embarrassed by their nudity and asks him to leave. When Susan wakes up, Johnny is there with an update on the car and she tells him that that evening the director has asked them to perform a scene together from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Later, during the performance for the clothed theater group, Lattimore arrives at the camp's entrance demanding to take Joan home with him. However, some members persuade him that he is tired and angry and should rest overnight and resume discussions in the morning. Before going to sleep, Lattimore visits Joan, who tells him that she is happy there and wonders why he is so grouchy and makes her mother cry. Early the next morning, unaware that he is in a nudist camp, Lattimore leaves his cabin for a stroll and meets the theater director, whom he recognizes as a famous Shakespearean actor, but is stunned when the man goes swimming naked. After observing more nudists, Lattimore phones his lawyer demanding that he take action against Susan and Joan, but the lawyer refuses as, he too, is a nudist. Later, Lattimore meets Johnny and apologizes for his conduct the night before and, after wandering around the camp and observing how relaxed everyone is, becomes enthused about nudism and decides to become a member. As Susan is putting Joan to bed, Lattimore comes to apologize to Susan for his years of hateful behavior. When Johnny shows up to take Susan to dinner, he announces that the baby sitter cannot come but he has arranged for Lattimore to do the job. Johnny and Susan leave as Lattimore begins to tell his granddaughter a bedtime story. Back in the present, Lattimore ends his account of his conversion and his plans to donate a gymnasium to the camp. In the interim, Susan and Johnny have married and are rehearsing a play. All then head for the camp, where they go swimming naked together.  Cast  *Mickey Knox: Johnny Patterson *Jamie O'Hara: Susan Latimore *Karen Sue Trent: Joan Latimore *R.G. Armstrong: J. Randolph Latimore  Court case  In the late 1950s Garden of Eden was the subject of a court case, Excelsior Pictures vs. New York Board of Regents. The New York State Court of Appeals ruled that onscreen nudity was not obscene, and this ruling opened the door to more open depictions of nudity in film.

In 2007, it was tentatively recognised as a distinct subspecies on the basis of genetic analysis. Morphological evidence indicates that the split between the African wildcat subspecies in Africa occurred in the area of Tanzania and Mozambique. It is also known in English as the 'bush cat'. Characteristics The body of the Southern African wildcat is marked with vertical stripes but these can vary from faint to quite distinct. The tail is ringed with black and has a black tip. The chin and throat are white and the chest is usually paler than the rest of the body. The feet are jet black underneath. There are two colour phases; iron-grey, with black and whitish speckling, and tawny-grey, with less black and more buffy speckling. In appearance it is very similar to a domestic cat, although the legs are proportionately longer. The most distinguishable characteristic is the rich reddish-brown colour on the backs of the ears, over the belly and on the back legs. Its body length is with a long tail; and weight range . Distribution and habitat The Southern African wild cat is widely distributed throughout Africa south of the equator, but does not occur along the Namibian coast. It tolerates a wide range of habitats that provide some sort of cover. Ecology and behaviour Southern African wildcats are largely nocturnal, finding cover in which to rest during the day. Their habits are solitary, except for mating and raising their young, and they are highly territorial. They are adaptable predators, preferring to hunt small rodents, but able to change their diet according to seasonal and longer-term prey abundances and availability; they have been observed to take other small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates. The largest recorded prey include hares, springhares and birds up to the size of guineafowl. Threats The main threat to the survival of the Southern African wildcat is its tendency to crossbreed with domestic cats near human habitations. Other threats include persecution by hunters and farmers, as well as habitat loss.

In 1921, she won the Hawthornden Prize. Life Florence Wilson was the daughter of Arnold Muir Wilson. She attended West Heath School (1906–10) and then began to study law at Girton College, the first women's college in Britain. In 1914, she completed her studies with moderate success. During the First World War she sold potatoes for the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. As a writer she took the pseudonym of Romer Wilson. During the war she began writing her first novel Martin Schüler, which was published in 1919. In 1921, she received the Hawthornden Prize for the novel The Death of Society: Conte de Fée Premier. In addition she wrote Green Magic (1928), The Hill of Cloves (1929) and Red Magic (1930) which were collections of fairy tales from all over the world, and a biography about Emily Brontë entitled The Private Life And History Of Emily Jane Bronte (1928). Her novels contained a philosophical trend that spoke to some of the major concerns of the time, but also future generations. Among the subjects in her books topics included the First World War and its devastating effects on the civilization and personal relationships, the demise of a predominantly rural world, the harmful consequences for agriculture and human life through the introduction of machinery and the replacement of manual work through automation. In addition, however, they also looked at the role of the artist and the difficulties in romantic relationships that are frustrated by the war or social conventions. Storm Jameson, who helped manage Wilson for Blanche Knopf, described her novel Dragon's Blood as a prevision of Hitler's Nazi Europe. \\"In Romer Wilson, genius took the form of a short cut between her senses and her half-conscious mind.\\" Romer Wilson died from the effects of tuberculosis during a stay in Switzerland.

This species has eight arms and two retractable limbs like a squid, while also remaining closer to the ocean bottom similar to the octopus. While the common name may suggest this species is a squid, they are more closely related to cuttlefish. Seen in winter on sandy slopes away from strong currents in moderately shallow water, it moves in summer to deeper water where it breeds. The female cements the egg capsules under a stone or in some other concealed location, and both male and female die soon after breeding. Subspecies Two subspecies are recognised: - * Rossia pacifica diegensis Berry, 1911 * Rossia pacifica pacifica Berry, 1911 Description 296x296px The stubby squid is a small species growing to a maximum mantle length of about and a total length of , with females being larger than males. The head bears eight short arms, a pair of retractable tentacles and two large eyes. The first pair of arms is shorter than the others and the third pair the longest. The arms are circular in cross-section and each bears up to four rows of suckers on the middle section and two rows elsewhere. The tentacles have club-shaped tips with suckers and retract into pits in the head. They can be as long as the body when fully extended. The mantle (body) is not fused to the head and is flattened dorso-ventrally and rounded at the back. It does not contain the cuttlefish bone typical of cuttlefish in the family Sepiidae. There are two large semi-circular fins with wide bases on either side of the mantle. The upper surface of this epic squid is normally a reddish-brown colour with a scattering of small brown or yellowish spots, but can change to greyish-green when the animal is startled. Distribution and habitat The stubby squid is native to the northern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Korea, Japan and the Bering Sea to the western coast of North America, as far south as California. Its depth range is . Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) researchers reported a sighting of a stubby squid even deeper in the ocean. In Puget Sound it is seen in winter in regions of sloping muddy sand away from strong currents at less than but moves into deeper water in the summer. When found in coastal regions it has been typically reported in the sub-tidal zone (16–370 m) and has been found at night swimming at shore in the intertidal zone. It has been found to be able to live and survive in highly polluted urban west coast bay areas of the United States. Behaviour The stubby squid usually rests on the seabed and moves around, either by movement of its fins or by expelling a jet of water from its body cavity through a movable funnel just below the head. When disturbed, it can leave behind a thick blob of black ink as it speeds away by jet propulsion. It is nocturnal and spends the day semi-buried in soft sediment on the seabed. To submerge itself, it directs a stream of water at the sand to create a funnel-shaped depression, then it settles in the hollow and scoops sand over itself with a pair of arms, just leaving the eyes exposed. While immobile, it folds its arms under its head. = Feeding habits = The stubby squid has a hardened beak it uses to eat, its mouth is centered on the body and all tentacles connect at this point as well. It has adapted to a carnivorous diet by using a raptorial style of hunting. The squid will use its specialized eyes to locate the prey and then attack with its tentacles. More than 80% of their diet is shrimps but they also consume small crabs, mysida, fish and other cephalopods.  Reproduction  Breeding takes place in late summer and autumn in deep water. The male will transfer the spermataphores (bundles of sperm) into the female's mantle cavity with his hectocotylus, first left arm. The mature male and female die soon after breeding, having lived for about two years. The average female will deposit between twenty-five and fifty eggs in clusters, attaching them to the underside of stones, clams or seaweeds. The capsules are creamy-white, hard and durable they take four to nine months to hatch and receive no additional care. The egg itself (4–5 mm in diameter), is contained in a larger capsule (8 mm by 15 mm). The juveniles that emerge are miniature versions of the adults.

He was Minister of Public Education and Religious Affairs, and then Minister of Justice in the Cabinet of Jacques Laffitte (2 November 1830 to 13 March 1831). Early years Joseph Mérilhou was born in Montignac, in the Périgord region, on 15 October 1788. He was the son of Jean Mérilhou and Madeleine Desmond. He studied the classics in Périgueux. He qualified as an advocate from the school of law in Paris. He became an advocate in the First French Empire, and was an assistant procurer-general in the Court of Paris during the Hundred Days. Bourbon Restoration After the Bourbon Restoration Mérilhou was placed on the list of magistrates suspended from their functions, and was obliged to leave Paris for several months. After returning he rejoined the bar and took part in the struggles of the constitutional opposition. In 1817 he defended Comte and Dunoyer, editors of the Censeur, against the correctional tribunal. He was one of the founders of Society of Friends of Press Freedom. Mérilhou defended the Duclos brothers at the court of assizes in Paris when they were accused of being part of the \\"black pin\\" conspiracy. He also defended Arnold Scheffer, Brissot and Feret, trying to show in each of his pleadings the need to place the institutions of France in harmony with what he thought was the spirit of the Charter of 1814. On 14 July 1819 Mérilhou won the first case pleaded before a jury, that of Gossuin, editor of the Bibliothèque historique, charged for having criticized the Swiss in the king's guard. As a member of a company responsible for helping the families of citizens in preventative detention, he was prosecuted for this activity. He was defended by Dupin the Elder and discharged on 23 June 1820. Mérilhou was a leader of the Carbonari. He defended Bories, one of the four Sergeants of La Rochelle, in August 1822. The Advocate General Louis Antoine François de Marchangy alluded to him when he said in his indictment, \\"Here the real culprits are not those in the dock, but those on the benches of advocates.\\" thumb Mérilhou defended La Tribune de la Gironde in 1822 and Le Courrier français in 1825 and 1829. He supported the attacks by Montlosier against the \\"priests' party\\", and was one of the signatories to the Consultation of 1 August 1826. In 1827 he published a book about the life and works of Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, the great orator and supporter of a constitutional monarchy. Mérilhou was violently opposed to the ministry of Jules de Polignac and recommended refusal to pay taxes. July Monarchy Mérilhou played an active role in the July Revolution. It was due to his advocacy that on 28 July 1830 the Commercial Court of Paris allowed the printing of newspapers despite the ordinances. On 29 July 1830 Mérilhou was appointed to the Municipal Commission of Paris, and two days later was appointed provisional secretary-general of the ministry of Justice. He was made a Councillor of State on 20 August 1830. At the Ministry of Justice he undertook various important measures such as renewal of prosecutors and justices of the peace and abolition of the Ministry of State and the office of the seal of titles. He prepared for the vote the law of 11 October 1830 that abolished the \\"sacrilege\\" law of 1825 which punished profaners of consecrated hosts with death. On 2 November 1830 Mérilhou replaced Victor de Broglie as Minister of Public Education in the cabinet of Jacques Laffitte. On 27 December he replaced Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure as Minister of Justice. He left the ministry on 13 March 1831. Mérilhou was elected deputy for four constituencies, and chose Sarthe. He sat in the Chamber of Deputies from 1831 to 1834. He became a member of the Court of Cassation in 1832. In 1837 he entered the Chamber of Peers. After the February Revolution he lost his seat in the Court of Cassation, but was restored to this position by a decree of 10 August 1849.

He has been releasing music under the Hot Since 82 moniker since 2012. Personal life Padley entered the electronic music scene at a young age, beginning to frequent area nightclubs at the age of 14. His DJ education started at 17, playing 12–13-hour sets each Sunday at a club in his hometown (under his birth name). His residency soon became a top afterparty destination for clubbers in the area. As word got around, Padley's notoriety increased, resulting in a 2006 residency at Cream Ibiza in Amnesia under the banner of Leeds club Glasshouse. Becoming Hot Since 82 In 2010, Padley was attending an Ibiza afterparty when the music suddenly cut out. He plugged his iPhone into the party's speakers, and incidentally, one of his works-in-progress came on. Though Padley had admittedly not made the track with the intent of releasing it, reactions at the party were roundly positive, causing him to contact his friend Danish DJ / Producer Noir, who runs the record label Noir Recordings. Noir was impressed, and released it on his label. 'Let It Ride' came out on Noir Music on September 5, 2011, hitting number three on Beatport's deep house chart. Thus, Hot Since 82 was born. Musical career Rising out of obscurity, Daley has recently been featured in a variety of widely popular electronic music media. After a year of releasing his music, Daley was featured on Pete Tong's Essential Mix show on BBC Radio 1 in August 2013, playing a two hours exclusive set. Soon after, Daley was commissioned for a remix of electronic music pioneer Green Velvet aka Curtis Jones' song 'Bigger than Prince.' The track was released in September 2013, and rose to Number 1 on Beatport's dance music charts. He released his first full-length album, Little Black Book, in October 2013 on Moda Black Records, featuring collaborations with Joe T Vannelli and Thomas Gandey, as well as remixes of Rudimental and Shadow Child. Padley launched his own imprint, Knee Deep in Sound, in 2014, on which he hopes to release music from up-and-coming artists with an underground \\"vinyl\\" sound. Electronic music website Dancing Astronaut ranked Hot Since 82 at Number 7 on their list of Top 25 Techno & Deep House Producers of 2013. In April 2014, Hot Since 82 was featured as Mixmag's cover story, with a recent mix of his featured as the magazine's 'cover mix.' Padley was featured on Pete Tong's Essential Mix in July 2015; playing a special full three hours recording of his set from ENTER at Space, Ibiza. Padley has toured in Europe and North America and has headlined many of the world's leading electronic music festivals, including Creamfields and WMC. In 2017, Padley was nominated for Producer of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards. On May 23, 2019, Padley announced the Even Deeper Brazil documentary that explores dance culture and more in Brazil.

The by- election was caused by the resignation of the incumbent, Charles Brown, and was won unopposed by Henry Sewell. Whilst Sewell was not a local resident, he was a member of the government through his appointment to the Legislative Council, the upper house of Parliament. Sewell accepted the invitation to represent the electorate, as him becoming a member of the lower house was seen to strengthen the government. Background =Charles Brown= Aged 33, Brown had been elected the first Superintendent of the Taranaki Province in 1853. He had served until his defeat in 1857 and had been re-elected in 1861, and held that post at the time of the 1865 by-election. Brown had first been elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives in the in the electorate, another constituency in Taranaki. Since an , he had been representing the Town of New Plymouth electorate. Brown's resignation, published on 15 April 1865 in the Taranaki Herald Brown resigned from the House of Representatives on 12 April 1865, and informed the electors via an advertisement in the next edition of the Taranaki Herald of his decision. The advertisement called for a meeting on the day of its publication where Brown would outline his reasons for resigning. Due to the short notice, only ten electors came and the meeting was postponed by a week. At the next meeting, again held at the Masonic Hall in New Plymouth, 50 electors turned up, and Thomas Kelly took the chair. Brown explained that his principal objective as a member of the House of Representatives was to \\"watch the progress\\" of the Taranaki compensation. This compensation was in relation to the First and Second Taranaki War, where settlers were commandeered by the government to join the local militia, and once under military command, they had to watch when their homesteads were destroyed and their cattle were stolen without being able to respond, and the military hierarchy would not let them. Henry Sewell estimated the loss to the settlers at close to £200,000. Another item of interest to him was the exchange of town sections, which the government had since assigned Henry Sewell to resolve. Brown noted that when Parliament was in session in Wellington, he could not simultaneously carry out his duties as Superintendent, as that required him to be in Taranaki, which caused problems for the province. The only issue that justified him remaining in the House of Representatives was to represent the area's interest with regards to the proposed harbour construction, but the cost estimate for this was still several months away. Attendees passed a motion that Brown had fulfilled his duties in an appropriate manner while he represented them in the House of Representatives. =Henry Sewell= Henry Sewell had first come to New Zealand as the deputy chairman (a paid position) of the Canterbury Association in February 1853. The Association was in financial crisis and Sewell was instrumental in resolving the debt issues for Canterbury Province. In August 1853 Sewell stood in New Zealand's first general election, winning the Town of Christchurch electorate, which he represented in the 1st New Zealand Parliament. Sewell was re-elected in the and also elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council for the Lyttelton electorate in 1855. In May 1856, he became New Zealand's first Premier. He resigned from Parliament later in 1856 but remained an unofficial member of Parliament's executive and returned to England on ministerial duties. Sewell returned to New Zealand in early 1859 and again took up a previous role as Colonial Treasurer. He was re-elected to the House of Representatives in an and served until the end of the term in November 1860. At the end of the session, he was dissatisfied with the actions of his former fellow Government ministers and did not seek re-election. Instead, he was appointed Registrar-General of Lands by Edward Stafford. In August 1861, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council so that he could become part of the 2nd Fox Ministry as Attorney-General. By all accounts, Sewell was a senior politician. Election Electors made a requisition to Henry Sewell, asking him to represent the electorate in the House of Representatives. The Taranaki Herald predicted that Sewell would accept the invitation, as it would strengthen the government by having him as a member of the lower house as opposed to the upper house. The Taranaki Herald further predicted that there would not be any opposition to Sewell's candidature. Sewell, who at the time was in Wellington, placed an advertisement in the 6 May edition of the Taranaki Herald accepting the invitation. Sewell stated that he would continue to look after the interests of Taranaki as a member of the government. The acceptance was dated 24 April; there were no telegraphs to New Plymouth at that time, but mail was carried by ship. The Taranaki Herald put its support behind Sewell's candidature, too. At the nomination meeting on 19 May, Sewell was the only person proposed. He was thus declared elected unopposed by the returning officer. Sewell resigned from the Legislative Council three days later. James Crowe Richmond was appointed to the Legislative Council to fill the vacancy left by Sewell. Richmond was appointed on 8 July 1865, which was soon after the 3rd Parliament began its fifth session. Sewell represented the Town of New Plymouth electorate until the end of the term in 1866, when he returned to live in England for some years.

They were used for many of the airship bombing raids on the United Kingdom in 1915-16, for naval patrol work over the North Sea and Baltic and were also deployed on the eastern and south-eastern fronts. Design The P class was an enlarged version of the preceding M class. On 5 August 1914 the Zeppelin company put forward a proposal to the German Navy Ministry for a design based on LZ 26\\\\. This had been started as a passenger carrying craft for DELAG and was the first Zeppelin with a duralumin framework, and also had the strengthening keel inside the hull structure. The proposed design was larger, with the volume increased from to and a fourth engine was added.Robinson 1971, p. 35 As well as being larger, allowing a greater range and bomb load, the P class introduced enclosed crew accommodation: the gondolas of the first M class Zeppelins were open. The P class had a more streamlined hull shape than previous Zeppelins, with only 60 m (197 ft) of the 163.5 m (536 5 in) overall length being parallel sided.Robinson 1973, p.95 Power was initially provided by four Maybach CX six cylinder engines. Later examples were fitted with four Maybach HSLu engines. The framework was divided into sixteen 10 m (32 ft 9 in) bays, with an intermediate frame between each of the principal wire-braced ring frames to reduce lateral loads on the triangular section longitudinal girders, of which there were 17, the uppermost of which was doubled to form a W-section girder. The 16 gasbags were usually made from three layers of goldbeater's skin on a cotton backing, but shortages meant that sometimes heavier rubberised cotton was used instead. Automatic pressure relief valves were placed at the bottom of the gasbags: there was no trunking to carry vented hydrogen to the top of the craft and waste gas simply diffused upwards in the space between gasbags and the covering, whose top surface was left undoped to allow the hydrogen to escape. Some gasbags were also fitted with a manually operated manoeuvering valve at the top.Robinson 1973, pp.96-100 The ship was controlled from the forward gondola, which was divided into two structurally separate sections in order to avoid transmission of engine vibration to the crew accommodation: the small gap between the two sections was faired over with fabric. The forward section was divided into three compartments, with the control area at the front; aft of this was the radio compartment, and then the officer's rest area, the windows of which had a machine-gun mounting either side. The engine compartment contained a single engine driving a propeller at the rear through a reduction gear. The aft engine gondola carried three engines arranged in line, the aft engine driving a propeller at the back of the gondola and the other two driving a pair of propellers mounted either side of the hull. These were reversible to aid manoeuvering during mooring. As in the forward gondola, a machine-gun mounting was fitted either side. Further defensive armament consisted of a single machine gun in a small cockpit at the stern behind the rudders and a gun position mounting two or three machine guns on top of the hull, which was reached by a ladder from the forward gondola. The bomb load was slung from the keel girders, the bombs being electrically released from the control car. In late 1915, faced by increasingly effective defensive measures, Zeppelin introduced the Q class. The hull was lengthened by , increasing volume to and the operating ceiling by about .Robinson 1973, p.101. Many of the existing P class airships were similarly lengthened. Service history Wreckage of Zeppelin LZ 49 (LZ 79) after being forced down. P and Q class Zeppelins were operated by both the German Army and the Navy. Although the bombing raids are their best known activity, the majority of the flights made by the naval craft were patrols over the North Sea and the Baltic. The class was obsolete by 1917 and most of the craft that had not been lost to accidents or enemy action had been dismantled by the end of September 1917. The last survivors were LZ 50 (L 16), which had been relegated to training duties and was wrecked at the Nordholz base on 19 October 1917.Robinson 1973, p. 334 and LZ 46 (L 14), which carried out 42 reconnaissance missions and 17 attacks on Britain. It survived the war and was destroyed by its crew on 23 June 1919.Robinson 1971, p.385 The first P class Zeppelin constructed was LZ 38, assigned to the Army and first flown on 3 May 1915. After a series of raids on the East coast of England, it became the first airship to bomb London on 31 May 1915, dropping of bombs on the eastern suburb of London, killing seven people. A consequence of this raid was that reporting restrictions were introduced in England. Formerly press coverage contained detailed accounts of the location of bombing raids: after this, only generalised locations were published.Robinson 1973, p.103. It carried out five raids on England,Robinson 1973, pp.102-3. before it was destroyed when its shed at Evere was bombed on 7 June 1915.Robinson 1973, p. 333 LZ 40 (L 10) was the first P class flown by the Navy, and bombed London on 4 June 1915. It took part in five raids and made eight reconnaissance flights: on 3 September 1915 it was struck by lightning and crashed in flames in the North Sea near Neuwerk, Germany, with the loss of the entire 20-man crew.Robinson 1971, p.384 On 8 September 1915 LZ 45 (L 13), commanded by Heinrich Mathy, was the first Zeppelin to bomb central London, setting fire to textile warehouses to the north of St Paul's Cathedral and causing over half a million pounds worth of damage, around one sixth of all material damage caused by the bombing of Britain during the war.Robinson 1971 p. 109 LZ 47 (LZ 77) and LZ 49 (LZ 79) were deployed to Namur in order to carry out bombing raid on Paris. LZ 49 (LZ 79) bombed Paris on the 29/30 of January, but was damaged by ground fire and was destroyed in a forced landing at Ath in Belgium. The Army Zeppelins were then used to support the German army in the early phases of the battle of Verdun. On 21 February, the first day of the German offensive, four of the six available Zeppelins set out to bomb the French supply lines. LZ 65 (LZ 95), the first Q class Zeppelin, was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire and was destroyed in a crash landing at the base in Namur. The P class LZ 47 (LZ 77) was hit by anti-aircraft fire over Revigny, catching fire and killing the crew of 11, and LZ 58 (LZ 88) was forced to return to its base by squalls and snow showers.Robinson 1973, p. 114 The Army airships LZ 85 and LZ 86 were deployed to the Eastern front. LZ 85 made two successful attacks on Salonika but during a third raid was damaged by fire from HMS Agamemnon on 5 May 1916 and came down in the Vardar marshes.Robinson 1973, p. 113 The crew of 12 were captured. The framework was salvaged and, partially reconstructed, put on display near the White Tower in Salonika.. LZ 51 (LZ 81) was deployed on the Balkan front, and was used to transport diplomats across hostile Serbia to Sofia on 9 November 1915. Subsequently, it made two attacks on Bucharest: it was eventually brought down by ground fire near Turnovo in Bulgaria on 27 September 1916.

Thomas Malton the elder's Treatise on Perspective contains the first known 3-dimensional pop-up to appear in a commercially produced book. This pop-up, as well as the others in Treatise on Perspective were used to help artists and architects understand and apply the concept of perspective to their work. Life Born in London, Malton originally kept an upholsterer's shop in the Strand. He contributed two drawings of St. Martin's Church to the exhibition of the Free Society of Artists in 1761, and also architectural drawings to the exhibitions of the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1766 and 1768. In 1772 and the following years he sent architectural drawings to the Royal Academy. There are drawings by him in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1774 Malton published The Royal Road to Geometry; or an easy and familiar Introduction to the Mathematics, a school- book intended as an improvement on Euclid, and in 1775 A Compleat Treatise on Perspective in Theory and Practice, on the Principles of Dr. Brook Taylor. The Compleat Treatise is the earliest known commercially produced pop-up book since it contains 3-dimensional paper mechanisms. Some of the pop-ups are activated by pulling string and form geometric shapes used to aid the reader in understanding the concept of perspective. It came to replace the pamphlet of Joshua Kirby as the standard English work on linear perspective. He also gave lectures on perspective at his house in Poland Street, Soho. Having fallen into financial difficulties in London he moved to Dublin, accompanied by his son James. He lived in the city for the rest of his life, gaining a reputation there as a lecturer on geometry. He died at Dublin on 18 February 1801 Family His eldest son was Thomas Malton, the younger. James Malton was another son.

This phenomenon was first identified in prostate cancer by whole genome sequencing of prostate tumors. Chromoplexy causes genetic material from one or more chromosomes to become scrambled as multiple strands of DNA are broken and ligated to each other in a new configuration. In prostate cancer, chromoplexy may cause multiple oncogenic events within a single cell cycle, providing a proliferative advantage to a (pre-)cancerous cell. Several oncogenic mutations in prostate cancer occur through chromoplexy, such as disruption of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN or creation of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene. Chromplexy was originally inferred by statistically analyzing the location of DNA breaks across the genome. Its prevalence across cancers is not known, because only a few types of tumors have been analyzed for chromoplexy in the published literature. However, it was detected in the majority of 57 prostate tumors analyze and has been reported in non-small cell lung cancers, melanoma and head and neck squamous cell cancers. It has also been reported to generate the canonical gene fusion, EWSR1-FLI1 and EWSR1-ERG, in Ewing sarcoma. Along with chromothripsis, and break-fusion-bridge cycles, chromoplexy is an example of chromoanagenesis, a catch-all term for events that generate complex structural chromosomal abnormalities.  Proposed mechanism  The mechanism underlying complex rearrangements in chromoplexy has not been identified. A proposed model is that DNA is brought together in nuclear transcription hubs where genes across multiple chromosomes are co-regulated by transcription factors such as the Androgen receptor. This DNA may then sustain multiple transient breaks during transcription and sets of broken DNA ends may be ligated to one another in an incorrect configuration. This model has not been demonstrated experimentally. Its merit is that it may account for the fact that chromoplexy appears to cause DNA breaks in regions of the nucleus that are actively transcribed and correspond to open chromatin. It also may explain how DNA from multiple chromosomes may be involved in a single complex rearrangement due to the nuclear co-localization of genes from multiple chromosomes at transcription hubs.  Relation to chromothripsis  Chromoplexy is similar to, but distinct from chromothripsis, a phenomenon whereby a single catastrophic event causes “shattering” of a chromosome:. The precise delineation between chromothripsis and chromoplexy is unclear, however general distinctions are # Chromoplexy often involve segments of DNA from multiple chromosomes (e.g., five or more), while chromothripsis usually involves clustered regions of one or two chromosomes. # A single instance of chromoplexy often involves fewer rearrangements than the hundreds described in chromothripsis. # In prostate cancers containing ETS+gene fusions (such as TMPRSS2-ERG), chromoplexy breakpoints are generally clustered within actively transcribed DNA and open chromatin. # While chromothripsis is often associated with loss of DNA (“deletions”), regions of lost DNA may be smaller and less common in chromoplexy. However, “deletion bridges” may be seen in chromoplexy that represent lost DNA at the fusion junctions of rearrangements. # In at least some instances of prostate cancer, chromoplexy can occur in multiple subsequent rounds. In contrast, multiple independent chromothripsis events have not been identified in single tumors.  Relation to cancer evolution  Chromoplexy has been proposed as a means by which cancer genomes may undergo bursts of evolution by altering multiple cancer genes across the genome in a single “hit”. For example, in at least one prostate tumor, a single chromoplectic event generated the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion while inactivating other tumor suppressor genes such as SMAD4.  References  Baca, S.

It was filmed in 1928 and 1929 and was directed, shot and edited by Janko Ravnik. It was a silent film shot in the black-and-white technique. The film was produced by the mountaineering club Skala and was 107 minutes long. Only about two thirds of the original film, i.e. the shortened 76-minute version, have been preserved until today. The screenplay was written by Juš Kozak. The story tells about a trip by a student, a railway worker and a peasant to the Julian Alps, the people they meet on their way, and their ascent to Mt. Triglav. The film features the mountaineers (Roban) and (Klemen). In the Kingdom of the Goldhorn was released on 29 August 1931 in Grand Hotel Union in Ljubljana. It was well received by the public, but criticised in reviews as amateurish. The last time the film was shown to the wider public was on its 80th anniversary in Grand Hotel Union in August 2011. A commemorative stamp with a motif from the film was published by the Post of Slovenia on this occasion.

The radius of this circle is called the corotation radius. Inside the circle the stars move faster and outside they move slower than the spiral arms. The Sun is located near the corotation circle of the Milky Way. A barred spiral galaxy, NGC 1300.  Implication with dark matter  The corotation circle takes on particular importance in reference to dark matter. In barred spiral galaxies (our Milky Way could be a galaxy of this type according to the most recent studies), the stars arranged along the bar structures rotate faster than those arranged along the arm structures, due to gravitational attraction. It has been calculated that if the radius of corotation were placed at a distance from the center of the galaxy greater than 1.4 times the length of the bar, this would constitute evidence that the rotation of the galaxy is curbed by dark matter halos, which are supposed to permeate space around the galaxy. All the measurements made, where galaxies have made it possible, have so far placed the circles of corotation at distances of less than 1.4, which would lead to the conclusion that dark matter does not significantly influence galactic rotation. However, a study published in the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) conducted by researchers from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias has shown that the arms of galaxies rotate more slowly than previously thought, implying that dark matter can influence the rotation of a galaxy even when the corotation circle is placed at a distance less than the value of 1.4 mentioned above.

The earliest known examples of this style date from the 17th century, but it continues to thrive and develop as a modern art form. The distinctive features of this folk art style are its flower patterns, distinctive brush techniques, and its traditionally white background (contemporary painters, however, often work on black, green, red or blue backgrounds). In 2012, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine recognized Petrykivka painting as a part of intangible cultural heritage of Ukraine, and it was included in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2013. Petrykivka painting has become a \\"brand\\" in Ukrainian popular culture, and a \\"Petrykivka\\" trademark belonging to the artisans of Petrykivka village has been created. History =Early History= It is believed that Petrivka painting originated from mural decorations of village houses. Painted wall decorations were prevalent in many parts of Ukraine, and different regions had their own characteristic styles.Кара-Васильєва Т., Чегусова З. Декоративне мистецтво України ХХ століття. Київ: Либідь, 2005. 280 pp. It was traditional for the painting to be restored once or twice each year. In addition to murals, household items made of wood and other materials were also decorated, particularly chests (and especially wedding chests). Later, the tradition of “mal'ovky” (мальовки) arose, in which paintings made in advance by a master on paper could be used to decorate house walls without a painter needing to visit them in person. There are also examples of 18th century religious icons from the Dnipro region that have floral ornamentation which could also be considered an ancestor of the modern Petrikivka style. The oldest Ukrainian wall paintings with floral ornaments date from the second half of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century in the Dnipropetrovsk, Sloboda, Podillia, and Uman’ regions, and they likely have a relationship or common origin with the Petrykivka style. Ornamental painting on walls and on paper were common in many villages of the Dnipropetrovsk area, but were most prevalent and highly developed in the village of Petrykivka, from which the style takes its name. Mural decoration of homes have existed in Petrykivka from at least 1860, and works on paper - from the late nineteenth century. From the time of the New Sich in the mid-1700s until the middle of the nineteenth century, these lands were primarily populated by settlers from the Poltava and Sloboda regions, and it is possible that these migrants brought this painting tradition to Petrykivka. No descriptions of wall decoration exist for the Poltava area in the nineteenth century, but there were reports of mural decoration in the Sloboda region, such as from 1860 in the Kupians’k area of Kharkiv province. Therefore, it has been proposed that the Petrykivka tradition originated from the Sloboda region. However, there also exist boxes with decorative floral painting from Poltava dating from the second half of the nineteenth century. Yet another alternative hypothesis is that this painting style came from Podillia via Uman’. However, murals with floral ornaments appeared there only much later. =Recognition and establishment (1911-1936)= No detailed historical references to Petrykivka painting exist before the beginning of the 20th century, when the ethnographer Dmytro Yavornytsky took an interest in it, and had Yevhenia Evenbakh, one of his students, make copies and collect samples (including murals) in two expeditions in 1911 and 1913. These “discoveries\\" formed the basis of a 1913 exhibition in Saint Petersburg. Another early researcher of Petrykivka painting was Yevhenia Berchenko, who organized exhibitions in 1928 Leningrad. Exhibitions by Petrykivka artists took place in 1935 and 1936 in Kyiv, Leningrad, and Moscow, and featured works by Tatiana Pata, Nadia Bilokin', Yaryna Pylypenko, Hanna Isaiev, Vasyl’ Vovk, and Halyna Pavlenko. This greatly popularized Petrikivka painting, which had until then been almost unknown among the general public. After these exhibits, Tatiana Pata and Nadia Bilokin' were awarded the honorary title of \\"Master of Folk Art\\". Also in 1935 and 1936, a special two-year school of decorative painting took place in Petrykivka. The main instructor was Tatiana Pata, who taught an entire generation of artists who would go on to establish Petrykivka painting as a contemporary art form. Tatiana Pata is often considered to be the founder of the Petrykivka school of painting, although in reality she was only continuing a tradition which she had learned from her grandmother. =Petrykivka artists in Kyiv= Kyiv porcelain vase with petrykivka painting by Marfa Tymchenko Several students of Tatiana Pata moved to Kyiv in 1936–1944, which lead to the first use of Petrykivka painting in industrial production at the Kyiv Taras Shevchenko Souvenir Factory (\\"Київська сувенірна фабрика ім. Т. Г. Шевченка”). It was here that varnish-covered painting on a nontraditional black background was first introduced, a technique which later also came to be used in Petrykivka village itself. This became the most prevalent form of Petrikivka painting during Soviet times. These artists also began to use the Petrykivka style for porcelain decoration. The first such attempt was by Halyna Pavlenko in 1936 while studying at the Kyiv School of Folk Arts (later the Kyiv Art and Industry College - \\"Київський художньо- промисловий технікум\\").Лампека М. Петриківська орнаментика на київській порцеляні // Актуальні проблеми мистецької практики і мистецтвознавчої науки. - 2013. - Вип. 5. - С. 272-279. In 1937 and 1938, she was joined by Vira Pavlenko, Marfa Tymchenko and Pelahia Hlushchenko. Porcelain decoration in the Petrykivka style was developed further in 1944 by the Pavlenko sisters and Vira Klymenko-Zhukov at the Kyiv Experimental Ceramic Art Factory [12] [13]. Marfa Tymchenko also joined that factory in 1953, and her work there was widely recognized. Porcelain vases personally decorated by Marfa Tymchenko were given as gifts by Soviet leaders to foreign dignitaries, including Richard Nixon, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, and Josip Broz Tito. =Development from 1950 to 1980= An atelier for textile production had existed in Petrykivka since 1929. In 1958, a cooperative workshop was created in that atelier for the production of varnished Petrykivka painted objects. The artists in that workshop included some of Tatiana Pata's most talented students. In 1958, the staff of the workshop included Hanna Isaieva, Yavdokha Kliupa, Maria Shyshats’ka, Nadia Shulyk, Ivan Zavhorodnii, Halyna Prudnikova, Oleksandra Pikush, Vira Tezyk, Nina Turchyn, Hanna Danyleiko, and (beginning in 1959) Zoia Kudish. In 1961, the cooperative was reorganized as the “Friendship” Factory of Petrikivka Painting (“Фабрика петриківського розпису «Дружба»”). Most products of the factory, particularly boxes and dishes, were made of pressed sawdust, which were covered in black paint, decorated, and then varnished. The artistic director of the factory until 1970 was Fedir Panko. From 1970-1988 this position was held by Vasyl' Sokolenko, and then by Anatolii Chernus'kyi, Volodymyr Hlushchenko, and Serhii Dreshpak. Its artistic advisory council included such famous masters as Hanna Samars’ka and Yavdokha Kliupa. By the late Soviet period the factory employed about five hundred people. Petrikivka-decorated plates, boxes, trays, vases, and other souvenirs became calling cards of Ukraine, and were exported to 80 different countries. In 2006 the factory was liquidated in bankruptcy, and in 2011 it was completely destroyed by unknown individuals who dismantled the workshops and presses.Фабрика «Дружба» Журналістське розслідування знищення Фабрики петриківського розпису. Газета «Урядовий кур'єр» від 17.10.2012 р.Глухенька Н. Петриківські розписи. Київ: Мистецтво, 1973. The T. Pata Petrykivka Children’s Art School (“Петриківська дитяча художня школа ім. Т. Я. Пати”) was also created in 1958. Its founding teachers of Petrikivka painting were Fedir Panko and Vasyl' Sokolenko, both students Tatiana Pata. While simultaneously working at the Petrykivka Factory, they taught the art form to the next generation of artists: most of the Petrykivka artists of the second half of the Soviet period were their students. Later, Valentyna Panko and Maria Pikush, both graduates of the School, became instructors there themselves. Pikush became its director in 1995. A series of albums of Petrykivka painting reproductions edited by the noted art historians Natalia Hlukhen’ka and Borys Butnyk-Sivers'kyi were published in the 1960s and ‘70s. With their large circulation, they did much to further popularize the Petrykivka painting style in Soviet Ukraine. In 1970, Fedir Panko also founded the Experimental Workshop of Petrykivka Painting (\\"Експериментальний цех петриківського розпису”) under the auspices of the Dnipropetrovsk National Union of Artists of Ukraine in a building in the center of Petrykivka village. In contrast to the Factory of Petrykivka Painting, its works were mainly on wood and paper, and primarily on a light background (as opposed to the black background typically used at the factory). The work of the artists at the Experimental Workshop was more creatively free and diverse than at the Factory, where ordinary artisans primarily copied works by the artistic directors. In addition to Panko, the Workshop included the artists Hanna Isaieva, Nadia Shulyk, Nina Turchyn, Andrii Pikush, Maria Pikush, Tetiana Har’kava, Valentyna Deka, Lidia Bulavin, Maria Yanenko, Natalia Statyva-Zharko, Valentyna Panko, and Halyna Nazarenko. =Recent history= In 1998, the Experimental Workshop became the basis of the Petrykiva Center of Folk Art under the direction of Andrii Pikush. Today, it is considered to be the nucleus of the Petrikivka painting style. The Center brings together approximately 40 leading Petrykivka artists, including (as of 2011) 25 members of the National Union of Artists of Ukraine and 7 Distinguished Folk Artists of Ukraine. This institution has been a home to such artists as Volodymyr Hlushchenko, Nina Turchyn, Valentyna Deka, Lidia Bulavin, Maria Yanenko, Valentyna Panko, and Halyna Nazarenko. In addition, many significant artists currently live in Petrykivka village but do not work at the Petrykivka Center, and a number of other artists trained in classical Petrykivka painting live and work in various cities throughout Ukraine, where they continue to develop the Petrykivka style. An annual regional festival of folk art under the name “Petrykivs’kyi Dyvotsvit” (lit. “Wonder-Flower of Petrykivka”) has taken place since 2007, typically in September. It has included markets, workshops, exhibitions, and concerts. In 2013 and 2014, the festival took place in Dnipro, and in subsequent years, in Petrikivka village.Відбувся перший обласний фестиваль народної творчості «Петриківський дивоцвіт» Фестиваль «Петриківський дивоцвіт» In 2012, the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture recognized Petrykivka painting as part of the intangible cultural heritage of Ukraine, and in December 2013 it was included in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. In January 2013, a “Petrykivka” trademark designed by Liudmyla Horbulia was registered, and was donated for the use of the community of Petrykivka village and its artisans as a symbol of authenticity. Technique and characteristics Petrykivka painting is traditionally dominated by plant forms, particularly of flowers. At times, they are depicted as abstracted shapes that do not necessarily correspond to any recognizable, naturally occurring plant species. In other cases, they are based on common garden flowers (e.g. dahlias, asters, tulips, roses), wildflowers (e.g. camomile, cornflower), and other plants (such as vibernum berries, strawberries, and grapes). Acanthus leaves (traditionally referred to as “ferns”) and flower buds are also commonly seen. The plant imagery is often combined with birds, and sometimes with images of animals and people, which are often depicted in somewhat fanciful form. Designs also commonly make use of the image of a phoenix or firebird. Historically, Petrykivka painting was done exclusively on white backgrounds (either whitewashed walls or on white paper), but contemporary artists have used backgrounds of a variety of colors, including black, blue, green, and red. Petrykivka painting is unabashedly two- dimensional, with no desire to depict “realistic” perspective. The overall design is built around one or more plant stems, to which are attached to all of the key elements of the composition. These stems or branches typically do not overlap each other, and many elements are depicted as silhouettes. Figures of birds, animals, and people are typically depicted in profile, while flowers are usually shown head-on. Many pictorial elements (such as petals, stems, and berries) are depicted using a single brush stroke. For some elements, such as berries, artists will use their finger to apply the paint, resulting in a characteristic round shape that is light in the center and has a darker “ring\\" at its edge. Professional Petrykivka artists mostly work without pre-drawn sketches and do not use measuring instruments. Instead, they work out the composition in their mind's eye, and do not begin execution until it has been fully thought through. =Types of brush strokes= Petrykivka painting makes use of four characteristic brush strokes: * “Hrebinets’” (“Comb\\") - a brush stroke that begins with a heavier pressure and thick line, then finished with a lighter touch and thin line. So called because a series of such strokes look like a hair comb. * “Zerniantko” (“Seed”) - a brush stroke that is the reverse of the “hrebinets’\\", with initial light and final heavy pressure. When such strokes are used on either side of a stem, the result resembles an ear of wheat. * “Horishok” (“Nut\\") - consists of two “hrebinets’\\" strokes that are curved and placed next to each other. Filling the resulting central negative space with a “zerniatko” stroke produces a form similar in shape to a hazelnut. * “Perekhidnyi mazok” (\\"Transitional stroke”) - made by a single brush with two differently colored pigments. A dry brush is dipped first into one (e.g. green) and then another (e.g. yellow) paint. The result is a line of yellow paint, which gradually turns into green. =Materials= Pigments were traditionally extracted from herbs, leaves, berries and flowers using specific preparation methods. Red was made from cherry juice, green - from grasses and nightshades, and blue - from snowdrop flowers. Various shades of yellow were obtained from sunflower petals, onion skins, and the bark of apple seedlings. Pigments were thinned using egg yolk or milk, and fixed using cherry sap or sugar from sugar beets. Synthetic dyes appeared much later, and gouache and watercolor were used only in the post-war period. The painting tools themselves also were of natural origin: brushes were made from tree shoots, stems of marsh grasses (especially rushes and cattails), and cat hair. Well- known artists in the Petrykivka tradition One of the best known petrykivka artists, Volodymyr Hlushchenko, at work in Petrykivka There are no historical records of Petrykivka painting prior to the beginning of the 20th century, and therefore the names of early artists have not been recorded. Largely thanks to the work of Dmytro Yavornytsky, the names of Petrykivka masters of the early 20th century (born in the 1880s and 1890s) were recorded, such as Tatiana Pata, Nadia Bilokin', Yaryna Pylypenko, and Paraska Pavlenko. These artists are the only ones of their generation whose works are known and are preserved in museums with attribution. In addition, there are a few known artists born in 1908-1919 who learned the tradition in their families (particularly in the families of the above-mentioned Paraska Pavlenko and Yaryna Pylypenko), but who developed creatively under the strong influence of Tatiana Pata. These include Hanna Isaieva (née Pylypenko), Nadia Tymoshenko, Vasyl' Vovk, Vera Pavlenko, and Halyna Pavlenko (later Pavlenko-Chernychenko). All of the other famous artists of this generation were students of Tatiana Pata and studied at the Petrykivka Art School between 1936 and 1941. These include: Fedir Panko, Vasyl' Sokolenko, Marfa Tymchenko, Vira Klymenko (later Klymenko-Zhukova) Pelahia Hlushchenko, Yavdokha (Evdokia) Kliupa, Maria Shyshat'ska, Oleksandra Pikush, Ivan Zavhorodniy, Halyna Prudnikova (Zavhorodnia), Nadia Shulyk, Zoia Kudish, Vekla Kucherenko (Pata), Hanna Danyleiko, Nadia Pikush, and others. Distinctive among the masters of the Petrykivka style is Anna Samara, who was the only known member of the older generation of painters that was not born and trained in Petrykivka village. She mastered the style and technique in Kyiv under the indirect influence of Petrykivka masters such as Marfa Tymchenko, and continued to develop her skills at the Kyiv Taras Shevchenko Souvenir Factory. The vast majority of the next generation studied Petrykivka painting under Fedir Panko and/or Vasyl' Sokolenko, as well as in some cases with one of the other master artists mentioned above. These include: Volodymyr Hlushchenko, Nina Turchyn (Shyshats’ka), Tamara Kudish, Nina Shulyk, Vira Tezyk, Anatolii Chernus'kyi, Nina Chernus’ka, Andrii Pikush, Maria Pikush, Uliana Skliar, Valentyna Panko, Valentyna Deka (Statyva), Lidia Bulavin (Statyva), Maria Yanenko (Statyva), Natalia Statyva-Zharko, Halyna Nazarenko, Tatiana Har'kava (Lapshyn), Liudmyla Horbulia, Olena Zinchuk, Yulia Nahai, Yaryna Nazarenko, Serhii Dreshpak, Valentyna Khomenko, Nina Borodina, Kateryna Tymoshenko, Tamara Teslenko, Natalia Kaliuha, Maria Kurin'ka (Bel’mas), Iryna Kibets', Olena Yarmoliuk, Olena Skytsiuk (daughter of Marfa Tymchenko), and others.Петриківка: Альбом репродукцій. Дніпропетровськ: Дніпрокнига, 2011. 232 с. Additional significant artists of this generation include Valentyna Karpets’-Yermolaieva, Valentyna Milenko, Natalia Rybak, Liana Skliar, Tatiana Pata (Skliar), Tamara Vakulenko (Samars'ka), Oleksandr Vakulenko, Viktoriya Tymoshenko, Mykola Deka, Svitlana Bilenko, Natalia Maliarchuk, Volodymyr Padun, and others. Among the most active contemporary Petrykivka-style artists are Halyna Nazarenko,Петриківка з Мамаєм із гільз Valentyna Panko,У Дніпропетровську презентували роботи відомої петриківської майстрині Валентини Панко Viktoria Tymoshenko, Natalia Statyva-Zharko,Величезна білоцерківська писанка виставляється у Києві Olena Yarmoliuk, and Natalia Maliarchuk. Petrikivka painting has often been a family craft, and many well-known Petrykivka artists (both historical and contemporary) often have well-known artists in their immediate family. Among the more famous of these “dynasties” are those of Panko, Pikush, Statyva, and Skliar. In some cases, these links are not obvious, as the carriers of the tradition were often women who changed their surname after marriage. It is also complicated by the fact that some relatively unusual surnames happen to be quite common in Petrykivka village, and two artists with the same name may in fact not be close relatives.

Despite its relatively small size (just two rooms), the gallery gained wide attention from critics and collectors, including a much publicized visit in 1970 by art collector and actor Vincent Price. Although many of the artists given their starts at the gallery went on to bigger venues, most remained loyal to McHugh and continued to exhibit, and sell work, through the gallery.

She belongs to the Nimpkish band of the Kwakiutl First Nation. Early life and education Barkhouse was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1961. She is related to several notable artists from the Kwakwaka'wakw art tradition, including Ellen Neel, Mungo Martin, and Charlie James. She was a student of metalsmith Lois Betteridge. In the 1980s Barkhouse played bass with the Ottawa, Ontario punk band The Restless Virgins. Career Beginning her professional career in the 1990s, Barkhouse's artworks highlight modern environmental and indigenous concerns through the lens of personal and shared histories. Many of her works use animal imagery. A major breakthrough work for Barkhouse was Harvest, completed in 2009. The mixed media sculpture was created for the 2009 The Muhheakantuck in Focus exhibition at Wave Hill in the Bronx, NY. It depicts the names of Indigenous groups of the Hudson valley on porcelain objects, laid out on a European-style table. A bronze coyote pulls at the tablecloth, giving the impression that the table service may crash to the ground. The piece was later acquired by the National Gallery of Canada, and has been loaned for touring exhibitions. After separating from her former partner, the Ojibwe artist Michael Belmore, they continued to work together on artistic projects, including the public installation Echo in Toronto. Barkhouse is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. =Public Sculpture and Installation= Beaver sculpture, part of Echo. Joel Weeks Park, Toronto Barkhouse has an extensive public sculpture practice. Her works are permanently installed in cities and institutions including the Thunder Bay Art Gallery, University of Western Ontario in London, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, Macdonald Stewart Art Centre in Guelph and the Millennium Walkway in Peterborough, Ontario. A major early installation of Barkhouse's is Lichen, a collaboration with Michael Belmore. Installed at the McMichael Gallery in Vaughan, Ontario in 1998, it includes several bronze sculptures of wolves, and a transit shelter with a poster of a raven. The McMaster Museum of Art in Hamilton, ON, permanently installed Covenant, a sculpture of two coyotes encountering each other, in 2012. In 2013, The Canadian Museum of History installed 'namaxsala (To Travel in a Boat Together), a bronze and copper sculpture of a wolf in a canoe, staring across the Ottawa River at Parliament Hill. The work was inspired by a story told to Belmore by her grandfather. Echo, installed in 2015 in Joel Weeks Park in Toronto, features three separate cast bronze sculptures. They include four squirrels worshiping an acorn, a beaver, and a fox. =Exhibitions= In 2017, the Koffler Centre of the Arts in Toronto organized a major solo exhibition of new and past works, Mary Anne Barkhouse: Le rêve aux loups, curated by Jennifer Rudder. The show toured with additional works to the Esker Foundation in Calgary, Alberta. It included major pieces such as Harvest, works previously included in group shows such as Red Rover from the 2014 Land Marks exhibit organized by the Thames Art Gallery, and new works representing further development of the aesthetics and concepts represented in these pieces. Red Rover, one of Barkhouse's major works exhibited in this show, continued the visual themes of wolves and poodles explored in May Contain Wolf, her contribution to the 2012 What is Land exhibition at the Tree Museum in Gravenhurst, Ontario. In 2005, Barkhouse and Belmore exhibited their collaborative works in the exhibition Sanctuary at the Art Gallery of Peterborough, Ontario.

The song was featured in a number of promotional teaser trailers for the album, featured on Albarn's official YouTube account in late 2013. The song contains a sample of late writer, Timothy Leary. Background Timothy Leary, (Center), is sampled on \\"Photographs (You Are Taking Now)\\". On 18 January 2014, the Warner Music Store was updated to include Damon Albarn's new album and its name was revealed – Everyday Robots, which is also the name of the first single. The deluxe edition of the album came packaged with a DVD of Albarn performing a few album tracks live at Fox Studios in Los Angeles. The DVD was filmed on 3 December 2013. On the next day, the album's information was removed from the website, which made many believe it was not supposed to have leaked so soon. A series of trailers also appeared on Albarn's YouTube account as a way of promoting the album. The trailers featured a lot of images, mainly from Albarn's past and his previous projects. As well as a 21-second clip which featured Albarn at the piano and, before showing the title: Damon Albarn. First Solo Album. Coming Soon. A further trailer appeared on Albarn's YouTube channel, which featured footage of Albarn and Russell in Albarn's Studio 13 in West London recording the album itself, showing many instruments and song lyrics written onto pieces of paper. \\"Photographs (You Are Taking Now)\\" contains a sample of writer Timothy Leary from the audiobook The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The sample itself is Leary talking the listener through a trip on LSD. The use of samples is something that Richard Russell, the song's producer is well known for. Russell was the executive producer for Gil Scott-Heron's 2010 comeback album \\"I'm New Here\\", in which multiple samples were used on the album, Bobby Womack's \\"The Bravest Man in the Universe\\", features a sample of Gil Scott-Heron as well. Russell is an out-spoken advocate of sampling and has used the technique on the remix version of \\"I'm New Here\\" with Jamie xx of The xx. Live performances Although the record will be released under his name, he said he wanted himself and his backing band to be known as The Heavy Seas. The band's first performance was at BBC Radio 6 Music Festival. \\"This is our first ever gig and it's quite nerve-wracking to be not only playing your first gig but playing it live on radio as well,\\" he told the crowd at the venue and the audience of 6 Music listeners. \\"But I suppose I should be used to it after all these years.\\" The gig also saw the first exclusive plays of songs such as \\"Photographs (You Are Taking Now)\\", \\"The Selfish Giant\\" and \\"Mr. Tembo\\", Albarn also played \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\" from Gorillaz eponymous debut album and The Good, the Bad & the Queen single \\"Kingdom of Doom\\" as well as \\"El Mañana\\" from Demon Days and the Blur B-Side \\"All Your Life\\". The song was also played by Albarn and his live band at the SXSW Festival, where he performed the song in its entirety in front of an American audience. The track featured the sample as a looped backing vocal as well and appears to be a very prominent feature on the song itself. Critical reception In his track-by-track review for NME Matthew Horton said: \\"\\"This is a precious opportunity,\\" declares a TV voice before resounding bass with almost techno depth takes us from the \\"patent courts of nature\\" to \\"the church of John Coltrane\\". A fairly circuitous route, sure, that sees time pass from the taking to the taking down of photographs. But the melancholy starts to give way to John Barry-esque strings – and suddenly our hero's sipping Martinis in a tux.

Graham (12 June 1885 Providence, Rhode Island – 25 October 1938 Chicago) was an American lyricist, composer, singer, and music publisher who flourished from 1906 to 1920 — a period that included World War I, the golden age of Tin Pan Alley (from about 1915 to 1920), the dawn of the Jazz Age (circa 1914), and the silent film era. Graham was a proponent of vaudeville and burlesque songs. But as a lyricist and publisher, Graham is most remembered for having been an exponent of blues songs. From about 1914 to 1919, Graham's success and popularity as lyricist and publisher led to close friendships with stars of the stage and silent screen — George M. Cohan, Sophie Tucker, Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, and many others. But after failing to have a hit as a writer or publisher for three or four years, and a year after the start of Prohibition, Graham quit writing music and publishing in 1921 and took a job as a department manager at Mandell Brothers, a large department store. In 1938, nine years after the Wall Street Crash and in the throes of the Great Depression, Graham died alone and penniless in the Cook County Hospital charity ward, reportedly unknown to those attending him and without any kin or friend mourning at his side. Graham's remains would have been interred in a pauper's grave were it not for an alert attendant at the Cook County Morgue, who, after recognizing his name on a list, contacted a sister, Elizabeth (Mrs. Lawrence Joseph Mulhearn; 1887–1982) of Bronxville, New York, and his ex-wife of 8 years, May Olivette Hill (1888–1978) of Los Angeles. According to Hill, his lyrics from \\"I Ain't Got Nobody\\", and other melancholy songs that made him popular, seemed to foreshadow his decline and ensuing loneliness.  Federal court case  Graham's firm, Roger Graham Music Publisher, published the \\"Livery Stable Blues\\". It was recorded in 1917 by the Original Dixieland Jass Band on the Victor label and is widely acknowledged as the first commercially recorded jazz. It was the first recording to sell a million records and its success established jazz as a popular genre. During production, Victor executives re-titled the B-side of Victor 18255 as \\"Barnyard Blues\\" in an effort to avoid offending target audiences with a seemingly vulgar title. Due to a labeling error, however, the record itself retained the band's original title. In June 1917, Roger Graham published \\"Livery Stable Blues\\", attributing the composition to Alcide Nunez (clarinetist) and Ray Lopez (cornetist; né Raymond Edward Lopez; 1889–1970), who were New Orleans jazz community colleagues. Months later, Leo Feist published virtually the same music under the title \\"Barnyard Blues\\", attributing the composition to Nick LaRocca, the director of the ODJB and cornetist on the ODJB recording. Publishing it landed Graham in federal court with a charge of pirating the theme — Max Hart (né, phonetic: Numkovsky; 1874–1950), manager for ODJB, et al. v. Roger Graham (1917). Graham won acquittal after Judge George A. Carpenter asked Nunez to define the blues, whereupon he made his famous reply: \\"Judge, blues is blues — a little off key but harmony against the rules\\". The judge ruled that the blues could not be copyrighted, resulting in neither party having a copyright. The judge also expressed doubt that musicians unable to read or write music could be said to have composed anything.  Career highlights  Rhode Island : Graham was a graduate of dental college. : A 1900 US Census lists Roger Graham as an office boy in Providence, living with his family at 320 Dyer Street. A 1907 City Directory lists Roger A. Graham as a song writer residing in Wickford, Rhode Island, on Champlain Street, near Phillips Street. First marriage : On June 1, 1906, Graham married Bessie H. (née Spink; 1883–1969) in Brooklyn, who was born and raised in Rhode Island. Records indicate that she had been divorced twice before remarrying (in 1916) her third and final husband, Frederick Charles Gilbert (1891–1944), a pharmacists from Rhode Island. The 1910 US Census lists Roger and Bessie as being married. Roger and Bessie apparently divorced sometime between 1910 and 1914, because Roger became engaged to May Hill in 1914. Move from Providence to Chicago in 1910 : According to the 1910 US Census, taken April 26 and 29, 1910, Roger and Bessie were married and living in Providence. But also, according to his obituary in the Chicago Tribune, Roger Graham moved to Chicago in 1910. Theodore Morse Music Company, Chicago : Early in 1913, Graham had been the professional manager in the Chicago office of Theodore Morse Music Company. Later that year, he was general manager of Morse's western branch in San Francisco. In December of 1913, he became manager of its New York office. May Olivette Hill (1888–1978), a Chicago-based pianist, singer, and composer, was Graham's assistant at Morse. Ellis & Co., Chicago : Around July 1914, Graham became road manager for Ellis & Co. Graham became engaged to May Hill around September 1914. : In 1915, Graham was a partner and the general manager of Craig, Ellis & Co., later known as Craig & Co. The name change was the result of James G. Ellis severing his relationship with the firm. Graham was mentioned as manager of Craig & Company as late as April 5, 1919. Craig & Co. was mentioned as being for sale in 1916. : When Graham founded his own publishing house in Chicago around 1917, he was first located in the Randolph Building at 145 North Clark Street, at Randolph Street. Marriage to May Olivette Hill : Graham married Hill on September 28, 1918, in Chicago. She had been the professional manager in the Chicago office of Ellis & Co., Craig, Ellis & Co., and Craig & Co. Throughout their relationship, from before their engagement in 1914, they were song writing partners, she writing the melodies, he writing the lyrics. Beginning around 1910, Hill, who had grown up in New Berlin, Ohio, had been a silent film pianist and organist. Her foray into Chicago publishing houses began as a song plugger. Hill also had been a pioneer of radio, working as a composer for a WGN radio show hosted by Quin Ryan (né Quin Augustus Ryan; 1898–1978) at the Drake Hotel. Retirement from music : Graham retired from music publishing in March of 1921 and became a department manager at the Mandel Brothers store. Divorce : Hill filed for divorce on March 24, 1925, in Chicago. Among other things, she was unhappy over Roger Graham's intolerance towards her invalid parents — Isaac B. Hill (1858–1927) and Anna Elizabeth (née Druckenbrod; 1865–1953) — when they were at the home of May and Roger. Roger Graham, 143 Dearborn Street : According to his obituary in the Chicago Tribune, Roger Graham Publishing Company was in the Tribune Building at 143 Dearborn Street until 1922. Beginning around 1919, many publishers had moved to the State-Lake Building — built in 1919. Graham, after 1922, conducted his business from home. When he died, he was living at 1429 East 66th Place, Chicago.Obituary: Roger Graham, Chicago Tribune, October 26, 1938 In 1922 the Tribune Building was torn down. Theory over the etymology of the word, \\"Jazz\\" : Graham, disputing many other claims over the origination of jazz, opined that Jasbo Brown, a pioneer of jazz in New Orleans, did it first in Chicago, around 1914.

Dearborn, Chicago * 1928, 1930: State-Lake Building, 190 N. State Street, Chicago  Death  At the height of his career, around 1918, his friends were stars of the stage and silent screen — George M. Cohan, Sophie Tucker, Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, and many others. Two decades later, he died, only aged 53, but alone, almost forgotten, in a charity ward at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago. When his body had been taken to the Cook County Morgue, an attendant recognized the name on his files and the county notified his sister in New York and his ex-wife of 10 years and song writing collaborator, May Hill, whom he divorced in 1936. \\"It's strange that everyone should have forgotten Roger\\", Hill remarked. \\"The songs he wrote seem to fit the loneliness of his death\\". He was buried in Palos Hills Memorial Park (aka Mount Vernon Memorial) in Cook County.  Extant music  Graham wrote lyrics to nearly 200 songs. His biggest hit, \\"I Ain't Got Nobody\\", is a blues that became a perennial standard. As of 2013, in jazz recordings alone, it has been recorded 311 times according to The Jazz Discography tune database; and it has been used in 23 films according to IMDb. Craig & Co. of Chicago, of which Graham was manager and partner, copyrighted it in 1916, and attributed the music to Spencer Williams and Dave Peyton and the lyrics to Graham. A 1915 manuscript copyright credits the music to Williams and Peyton, no mention of Graham. Attribution, however, was clouded by two earlier works. David Young copyrighted it in 1914, attributing the music to Charles Warfield (1878–1955) and the lyrics to himself. Clarence E. Brandon, Sr. claimed that the more well-known Williams-Graham-Peyton song was written in response to his refusal to sell the publishing rights to his 1911 \\"I Ain't Got Nobody\\", which, according to him, was shelved and sold only under the counter. Brandon's version was apparently not widely disputed. The two disputed versions were cleared in 1916 when Graham and Williams sold their rights to Frank K. Root & Co., a Chicago publisher (né Frank Kimball Root; 1856–1932), and later that year, Warfield and Young sold their rights to Root. Root henceforth published the work both ways; but the prevailing attribution has gone to Graham and Williams. R.A.

Ledner was born in St. Rose, Louisiana, to a family of Hungarian-Jewish immigrant bakers. She started her own bakery business in New Orleans in 1931. The Ledner bakery was initially known as \\"Mrs. Charles Ledner's Superior Home Baking,\\" operating out of the family's home. The bakery relocated several times subsequently as it grew. She sold her bakery business to Gambino's Bakery as a result of the hardships of World War II but subsequently opened a new bakery in Metairie, Louisiana, following the war's end.Leanne Myers Boone, Country Roads Magazine, 31 July 2013. Ledner's recipes reflected the German and Jewish influence on New Orleans cuisine in the mid-20th century. Ledner's recipes have been collected and published, and various versions of the Doberge recipe are available on-line, including a photograph of the traditional multiple thin layers used in the authentic Doberge recipe. A video narrative of the preparation of Doberge cakes in the tradition of Ledner is available on-line.Ryan McNamara, Country Roads Magazine, 24 July 2013. Ledner has at times been referred to as the \\"Doberge Queen of New Orleans\\". Ledner's son Albert C. Ledner was a noted architect.

Rutenbar (born November 19, 1957) is an American academic noted for contributions to software tools that automate analog integrated circuit design, and custom hardware platforms for high-performance automatic speech recognition. He is Senior Vice Chancellor for Research at the University of Pittsburgh, where he leads the university's strategic and operational vision for research and innovation.  Biography  Rutenbar received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1979 and 1984, respectively. He joined the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 1984. At CMU, his research group developed a wide range of novel CAD tools to optimize, synthesize, and perform geometric layout on analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. In 1998, he cofounded Neolinear, Inc. to commercialize these tools. He served as Neolinear’s Chief Scientist until its acquisition by Cadence Design Systems in 2004. In 2001, he was the founding director of a large, multi-university research center – the Center for Circuit & Systems Solutions (C2S2) -- funded by the US semiconductor industry and US Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA) to address challenges arising from the end of Moore’s Law scaling. He served as Director of C2S2 from 2001 to 2009. Also while at CMU, his In Silico Vox project developed novel hardware platforms for very fast, energy efficient speech recognition. In 2006, he cofounded the Silicon Vox Corporation to commercialize these ideas. The company was renamed Voci Technologies in 2010, and it focuses on high-performance solutions for enterprise-scale voice analytics. In 2010, he left CMU to become Head of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. At CMU, and continuing at Illinois, he led some of the first work to apply data mining and machine learning techniques for electronic design automation. In 2013, he launched a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on VLSI CAD, to over 17,000 registered participants. In 2016, this evolved into a set of related CAD MOOCs, which has reached over 50,000 learners worldwide. In 2017, he joined the University of Pittsburgh in the newly established position of Senior Vice Chancellor for Research. He also holds faculty appointments in the School of Computing and Information and in the Swanson School of Engineering. Rutenbar serves on boards for several entrepreneurial and cultural organizations in Pittsburgh, including LifeX, Innovation Works, and the Carnegie Science Center. Education and service contributions As several massive open online course (MOOC) providers emerged in 2012, Rutenbar led the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to establish a relationship with Coursera. Subsequently, the University become the first land-grant institution to enter a Coursera partnership. Under Rutenbar’s leadership, the Department of Computer Science launched a MOOC-based professional masters of computer science in data science (MCS-DS) in fall 2016. In 2014, Rutenbar led the launch of a large program of novel, cooperative B.S. degrees at Illinois called “CS+X” (a term originally coined by Alfred Spector, a former colleague of Rutenbar's at CMU) that integrate computing and “X” disciplinary topics, ranging from anthropology to astronomy, music, and agriculture. Illinois Computer Science was recognized in 2017 with the Grand Prize for the NCWIT Extension Services Transformation (NEXT) Award for showing “significant positive outcomes in increasing women’s meaningful participation in computing education” during Rutenbar’s tenure. Rutenbar has co-chaired the National Science Foundation Computer and Information Science and Engineering Advisory Committee’s Data Science Working Group, and he served on the National Academies of Sciences Committee on Envisioning the Data Sciences Discipline: The Undergraduate Perspective.

In sixty-three uncaptioned woodcut prints, the book is a contemporary retelling of the Greek myth of Icarus. Told with high-contrast black-and-white art with bold linework, the book's protagonist is a little man who leaps from the imagination of his sleeping creator. The little man repeatedly tries to find his way to the sun, climbing towers, trees, and a staircase of clouds before his success sends him plummeting back to earth—and his creator. Masereel was the first wordless novelist, and The Sun followed on the success of Masereel's first works in the genre, 25 Images of a Man's Passion (1918) and Passionate Journey (1919). A young Lynd Ward read a copy of The Sun while studying wood engraving in Germany, and the book was an influence of the American artist making wordless novels of his own, beginning in 1929 with Gods' Man. Synopsis An artist resembling Masereel rests his head on his desk beneath a blazing sun. From his head leaps a small male who, seeing the sun, sets out in pursuit of it, plummeting from the window in his attempt. Crowds of people try to divert him with sex and alcohol, but the little man persists in climbing trees, chimneys, church steeples, masts, and cranes. He climbs a staircase of clouds only to be burned by the sun, sending him hurtling back to the artist's desk, awakening the artist. The artist turns to the reader with a smile, tapping his head. Production, publication history, and legacy Masereel produced 63 woodcut pages for the story. It was first published in Switzerland under the French title Le Soleil: 63 images dessinées et gravées sur bois by Éditions du Sablier in 1919, and by German publisher Kurt Wolff the following year under the title Die Sonne: 63 Holtzschinitte. The first English-language edition appeared in 1990 from English publisher Redstone under the title The Sun: A Novel Told in 63 Woodcuts. American artist Lynd Ward read a copy of The Sun in its German edition while studying wood engraving in Germany in the late 1920s. Masereel's wordless novel and Otto Nückel's, Destiny (1926), moved Ward to create his own wordless novels, beginning in 1929 with Gods' Man. Style Over a fifty-year career Masereel's style and themes varied little from book to book: socialist messages told with images in a symbolic, almost cartoon style. The thick-lined artwork is in high-contrast black and white, with a compositional imbalance that impresses the reader to move from one picture to the next.

He served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, rising to the rank of captain. In the post- war period, with his brothers Robert and George, who shared his interests in horticulture, botany and plant collection, James was actively involved in the botanical, horticultural and commercial life of early colonial Western Australia. Life Mangles was the son of John Mangles (1760–1837), brother of James Mangles (1762–1838), the Member of Parliament. He entered the navy in March 1800, on board the frigate , with Captain Ross Donnelly, whom in 1801 he followed to . After active service on the coast of France, at the reduction of the Cape of Good Hope, and at the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, he was, on 24 September 1806, promoted to be lieutenant of , in which, in February 1809, he was present at the reduction of Martinique. In 1811 Mangles was appointed to , and in 1812 to , flagship in the English Channel of Sir Harry Burrard Neale. In 1814 he was first lieutenant of , flagship of Sir John Poo Beresford in his voyage to Rio de Janeiro. He was sent home in acting command of the sloop, and was confirmed in the rank of captain on 13 June 1815. This was his last service afloat. In 1816 Mangles left England, with his old messmate in the Narcissus, Captain Charles Leonard Irby, on what proved to be a lengthy tour in Europe, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor. They travelled with William John Bankes and Thomas Legh. Mangles was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1825, and in 1830 was co-founder and one of the first fellows and members of council of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1831 Mangles visited the Swan River Colony in Australia. His cousin Ellen Stirling (née Mangles) was wife of Lieutenant Governor James Stirling. On his return Mangles went into business with his brother Robert, and commissioned James Drummond to collect seeds, plants and herbarium specimens, which they sold to nurserymen.www.anbg.gov.au, Mangles, James (1786 - 1867). Mangles corresponded with several members of the Swan River Colony regarding matters of a botanical nature. The colonists included Georgiana Molloy, George Fletcher Moore, Captain Richard Goldsmith Meares, Ellen Stirling, James Drummond, Henry Mortlock Ommanney, and Sir Richard Spencer.Mangles, James.

Mangles died at Fairfield, Exeter, on 18 November 1867, aged 81. Works The letters of Irby and Mangles were privately printed in 1823, and were published as a volume of John Murray III's Home and Colonial Library in 1844.

His artistic inclinations began to emerge at his grandparents home in Sonneberg, the center of the German toy-making industry. During his years at the Gymnasium in Meiningen, he lived with his uncle Samuel Friedrich Diez, the Court Painter, who strongly encouraged Robert to pursue a career in art. He began his artistic training in 1863 at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. From 1867 to 1870, he was a pupil of Johannes Schilling. After his father died and he lost his means of support, he went to work in Schilling's studio. By 1872, he was able to open a studio of his own and take the traditional study trip to Rome. He was made an honorary member of the Academy in 1881. He succeeded Ernst Julius Hähnel at the Master Studio for Plastic Arts and became a member of the Academic Council in 1891.

Several examples of this successful aircraft, which competed in the two seat class at two World Gliding Championships in the 1950s, were still flying in 2000. Design and development In the 1930s Erwin Musger was a prominent Austrian glider producer. His first two-seat design was the gull wing Musger Mg 9, which set a world duration record in 1938. The Oberlerchner Mg 19 was a post- World War II development of the Mg 9, financed by the Austrian industrialist Joseph Oberlerchner, with a mid/low rather than high wing. The change of wing position was principally made to enhance the upwards view from the rear seat, which on the Mg 9 was blocked by the wing. The wing roots are carefully faired into the fuselage to avoid airflow turbulence and the 10° of dihedral on the inner third of the span takes the wing tips well clear of the ground, even though the outer panels had only 2° dihedral. Like the rest of the Steinadler, the two part cantilever wings is wood framed and covered in a mixture of plywood and fabric. Each part is built around a single spar, with ply covering ahead of it around the leading edge forming a D-shaped torsion box. Behind the spar the wing is fabric covered, except for small areas near the root and near the tip, where the aileron hinge angles in towards the spar, that require strengthening. On the earliest model, the Mg 19, the ailerons fill the trailing edge from bend to tip but such a large area produces heavy control loads and on the Mg 19a the ailerons are reduced in length by about a third. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes open above and below the wing just inboard of the bend at 44% chord. In plan the wing has a straight and swept leading edge. The trailing edge is also straight inboard of the ailerons, where the tips become semi-elliptical. A 1° sweep at one quarter chord produces a swept spar to allow the two ends to meet just behind the rear seat. On the later models the gull wing is replaced by one with a constant 5° dihedral without altering the tip ground clearance, though the clearance with extended airbrakes is small. Otherwise the wing of the Mg 19b is unchanged. The wing of the World Gliding Championships contending Mg 19c is different, with straight tapered outer panels, small tip bodies and a section which is a blend of the laminar flow NACA 64-2015 airfoil and the older, proven Göttingen 549. The Steinadler's fuselage has oval frames and slender longerons skinned with ply. Moving forward, it becomes deeper from behind the wing trailing edge and under the cockpit, where the two occupants sit in tandem. The rear seat is a little higher than that of the pilot for better forward vision and both are enclosed by a framed canopy divided into two parts, each of which is starboard hinged. A skid runs along the fuselage underside from nose to under mid-wing but the main undercarriage is a fixed, semi-recessed, monowheel, fitted with a brake, assisted by a sprung tailskid. The fuselage of the Mg 19a and later Steinadlers is some longer than that of the Mg 19. The whole horizontal tail and the rudder are fabric covered, the former straight tapered and round tipped, mounted on top of the fuselage ahead of the fin. The trailing edges of the elevators are ahead of the rudder hinge, with a port side trim tab. On the Mg 19b and c there is a low fillet ahead of the fin, not present on the earlier models. The fin is narrow, with a swept leading edge and the unbalanced rudder is D-shaped and broad. The Mg 19 made its first flight in November 1951. Including all models, 47 were built. All but one were built by Joseph Oberlerchner's Spittal factory. The exception is the Mg 19s, built by students in Graz, which had a long development time from 1956 to its first flight in 1960. With a steel framed fuselage and new wing it was quite different from the other Steinadlers and, in the view of one author, \\"not really a Mg 19 at all.\\" Operational history The Steinadler was used by many Austrian clubs and by 1963 had set most of the national two seat records. Several remained in service fifty years after the first flight and eleven remained on the Austrian civil register in 2009. The sole Mg 19c took part in the World Gliding Championships of 1956, held at Saint-Yan, the last WGC to have a separate category for two seaters, but did not finish in the top six.

Albarn gave an interview with Danielle Perry where he talked about the track, and said: \\"1976 is a long time ago really, there's that realisation that a lot of things have been quite interesting in the way I turned out. They seemed to be worthy of some kind of meditation.That's what I'm trying to do in Hollow Ponds: go back and then realise that it's now. In a way, how do we know that we exist other than that beam of light that's our history?\\" Albarn also revealed that the song samples a train leaving Leytonstone on the Central line on the London Underground and also the playground of Albarn's old school.

In the programme he returned to his former homes in Leytonstone, East London, and Colchester, Essex. Speaking in the programme, he revealed that he found his first solo LP tough, saying: \\"I've spent so long in bands, playing to large groups of people, that doing a solo album is quite a difficult thing for me to do. That's why I put it off for so long.\\" Speaking about being raised in London, he said: \\"Growing up in multi-cultural London in the 1970s played a big part of who I am.\\" The documentary included clips of songs from his album as well, including 'Hollow Ponds', 'Hostiles' and 'Mr. Tembo'.

That's a call back to 'Everyday Robots', the dehumanising effects of technology, and the song itself finally resolves into a drone and eerie electronic excursion.\\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/damon-albarn-everyday-robots- first-listen Dan Cains of The Sunday Times wrote: \\"The albums’s key song, this saunter back through the mists of time opens at the eponymous ponds that mark the southwestern edge of Epping Forest (near Albarn’s childhood home), in the 1976 heatwave.

The modern national flag of the Netherlands, officially introduced in 1937, is based on this historical flag. History The origin of the red-white-blue tricolour is not entirely clear; some sources suggest that it developed merely as a variant of red-white-blue because the red dye would tend to fade to orange over time. However, there have also been suggestions to the effect that the red-white-blue flag might predate the introduction of the Prince's Flag in the 1570s. Thus, Muller (1862) suggested that the colours were taken from the coat of arms of the Bavarian house, the rulers of the county of Holland during 1354-1433, who used the Bavarian coat of arms quartered with the arms of the counts of Holland.D.G. Muller, De oorsprong der Nederlandsche vlag, op nieuw geschiedkundig onderzocht en nagespoord, Amsterdam, 1862, p. 74. During the early part of the First Stadtholderless Period (1650–1672), the government of the Dutch Republic wanted to appease the republican government of the Commonwealth of England, and because the colour orange was associated with the House of Stuart, the orange-white-blue Prince's Flag was banned in 1652, replaced by the red-white-blue \\"States Flag\\". J.C. de Jonge, Over den oorsprong der Nederlandsche vlag, 1831, pp. 60-70. According to de Waard (1900), the Dutch navy between 1588 and 1630 always displayed the Prince's Flag, and after 1663 always the States Flag, but both flag variants were in use during the period of 1630-1662.C. de Waard, \\"De Nederlandsche vlag\\" in: Het Vaderland (1900). It appears that prior to 1664, the red-white-blue tricolor was commonly known as the \\"Flag of Holland\\" (Hollandsche Vlag). In 1664, the States of Zeeland complained about this, and a resolution of the States-General introduced the name \\"States Flag\\" (Statenvlag).JC de Jonge, Geschiedenis van het Nederlandse zeewesen, deel 1. 's Gravenhage, 1833, p. 75. In the 1930s, the supporters of the NSB chose the orange-white-blue and the Prince's Flag as their symbol. Queen Wilhelmina in 1937 signed a Royal Decree that the colors red, white and blue are set as the official colours of the Dutch flag, partly as a signal directed at the NSB.

From 1941-42, these areas saw mass executions, burning of villages and confiscation of property, motivated both by partisan fears of a \\"fifth column\\" and class conflict. As a result of these actions by the communists, many villagers from Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina joined Chetnik forces en masse. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia condemned actions undertaken during the period and punished several local commanders. Name This policy was also referred to as Leftist deviation or Left-wing deviation, Left Errors or sectarian deviations. In Titoist dogma after World War II, this policy was referred to as the \\"Mistakes of the left\\" or \\"left deviations\\" while the others referred to it as \\"Red Terror\\". This policy is sometimes referred to as the \\"Second Stage\\". Karl Marx believed that revolution has two stages: bourgeois- democratic and proletarian. He believed that in the second stage the proletarian revolution has to turn against its allies from the first stage. Background Tito formulated the leftist strategy of the CPY in October 1940 Tito was the main protagonist of the leftist deviations. Tito was well known as a leftist who was against any arrangements with non-communists. His formal appointment as general secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) was confirmed in October 1940 during the Fifth Land Conference of the CPY in Zagreb. At this conference Tito formulated the leftist strategy of the CPY as focused on revolutionary seizure of power in the country in order to organize Soviet-style administrative organization in Yugoslavia. In July 1941, after the beginning of the Second World War, the Communist Politburo adopted the strategy which insisted that the Partisans should aim to create \\"liberated territories\\", cleared of enemies. According to the instructions of the Poliburo, such territories were to be administered by the communists in a state-like manner so the local population would be exposed to the ideas and practice of the socialism. On the territories that came under their control the communists adopted many leftist policies including radical socialism. This antagonized many peasants in Serbia, Montenegro and Herzegovina. Laziness was punished as desertion, peasants were punished with high taxes or forced labor if their houses were not tidy or if they got lice. The Yugoslav communists suspended the instructions not to reach the second stage (the revolution) given by the Comintern in June 1941. Because they ignored instructions from Moscow the leadership of CPY could not find a modus vivendi with other resistance movement, the Chetniks of Mihajlović, because they could put in danger communist revolutionary action. That is why Tito rejected Soviet pleas to cooperate with Chetniks and insisted on carrying on with the communist revolution. Montenegro Moša Pijade, one of the main protagonists of Leftist errors in Montenegro In June 1941 the Regional Committee of CPY for Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak issued a proclamation inviting people to \\"final liquidation of capitalist system\\". Leftist errors policy was pursued in Montenegro since August while its intensity was increased since September 1941. This extremist policy was pursued by the Partisans in Montenegro under the influence of Milovan Đilas and Moša Pijade. After the initial success of the Uprising in Montenegro communists seized control of almost all the territory of Montenegro and began to fight against their class enemies. The substantial percentage of population of Montenegro supported Chetniks because they were afraid of the \\"red terror\\". Despite instructions to minimize the revolutionary side of their policies, the leaders of Montenegrin Partisans introduced \\"Soviet elements\\" in the summer of 1941, during the Uprising in Montenegro, because they perceived the uprising as the first stage of the communist revolution. On 27 July 1941 the Communist command for Montenegro issued an order for establishment of courts-martial aimed against those who they perceived as fifth column ending their order with proclamation \\"Patriots, destroy fifth column and victory is ours!\\". In mid-August 1941, Đilas wrote a letter to the Regional Committee of Yugoslav Communist Party for Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak and recommended an isolation and destruction of the fifth column. He emphasized that tolerance and inactivity of communists toward spies is a crime equal to treason. At the end of August 1941 the Regional Committee issued a directive which follows the recommendations of Đilas and insists on cleansing of the villages from the fifth column. In another directive issued in October the Regional Committee repeated similar instructions insisting on the destruction of those who disturb the mobilization of insurgents even by saying \\"wait, it's not the right moment yet\\".Dragutin Papović: “LIJEVE GREŠKE” – DRUGO IME ZA ZLOČIN, montenegrina.net; accessed 8 September 2018. Đilas himself wrote how retreating Partisans, who only punished their opponents in July, arbitrarily executed them following the Italian counteroffensive of August 1941. From September 1941 onward, Communist Party program documents began to mention courts authorized to prescribe the death penalties. This immediately came to life in practice. Since October 1941, the headquarters of Partisan forces in Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak published lists of executed \\"enemies of the people, including spies and traitors\\" with a note - \\"to be continued...\\". During the first year the victims included women who \\"flirted\\" with Italians. Most of the people killed by the communists in 1941 were military and administrative officers of former Kingdom of Yugoslavia before the war. According to professor Jozo Tomasevich, during the period of \\"leftist deviation\\" from circa December 1941 through May 1942, the Partisans, especially in Herzegovina and Montenegro, used terror against people who were not collaborating, but were potential class enemies. The Partisans occupied Kolašin in January and February 1942, and turned against all real and potential opposition, killing about 300 people and throwing their mangled corpses into pits they called the \\"dogs' cemetery\\". Due to this and other examples of communist terror, a part of Montenegrin population turned against the Partisans. According to Zbornik za istoriju, \\"[a] land without Chetniks was suddenly overwhelmed by Chetniks\\", largely due to the policies of Left Deviations. Communist executions of notable tribal chieftains in Montenegro caused additional animosity of middle class peasants towards communists. Đurišić soon recaptured Kolašin and held it as a Chetnik bastion until May 1943. His rule was marked by terrorizing Partisan supporters. A large number of captured Partisans and sympathizers were executed in following weeks, including lieutenant colonel Radisav Radević, major Batrić Zečević, captains Đuro Radosavljević, Mileta Lakićević and Tomica Jojić, and former member of Yugoslav Parliament Blagota Selić, none of which were members of the Communist Party. Đurišić formed a Chetnik prison in Kolašin, in which some 2,000 opponents were incarcerated and/or tortured. Many were handed over to the Italians. In March 1942, communists from Nikšić burned the villages of Ozrinići and Zagarač. According to some sources this was ordered by Đilas and Sava Kovačević. Between the onset of the Uprising in Montenegro and the middle of 1942, communists killed between 500 and 624 people in Montenegro, most of them during armed conflict. Serbia In September 1941, Serb Partisans established the Republic of Užice, a short-lived military mini-state with its administrative center in Užice. At the end of November 1941 Partisans were defeated and had to retreat from Serbia. The policy of leftist errors pursued by Josip Broz Tito substantially contributed to Partisan defeat in the Republic of Užice. Because of the repression of the communists and their intention to carry on with communist revolution the population of Serbia also turned against the uprising and communist insurgents. At the beginning of December 1941 the communists moved from Serbia to Bosnia (nominally NDH) and joined their comrades who had already left Montenegro. Herzegovina In January and February 1942 alone, Partisans executed 250 people in Eastern Herzegovina because they were accused of belonging to \\"fifth column\\". In Herzegovina alone the total number of civilians murdered by communists in 1941–42 was probably around 500. Owing to \\"leftist errors\\" the Partisans were chased out of Herzegovina during the summer of 1942, not by the Axis forces but by its population. Consequences The policy of leftist deviation proved counterproductive. Leftist deviation gave a real meaningful sense to the policy of those nationalists who found a way out of the difficult situation in collaboration with occupying and quisling forces. \\"Red terror\\" antagonized most of the peasantry and angered the Soviet Union. As a result of the communist actions, villagers from Eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, who were far from being collaborators or kulaks, joined Chetnik forces en masse. In February 2018 a pit called Jama Kotor with allegedly about 300 corpses of victims of red terror was examined in Gornje Polje village near Nikšić. Many human bones were found together with remaining parts of clothes. This was reported to the police that announced official investigation. Propaganda The songs and mottoes were composed to promote the policy of leftist deviations. The verse of one of them was: \\"Partisans, prepare machine guns, to greet the king and Englishmen\\"(). The Partisan slogan \\"Death to fascism, freedom to the people\\", a new greeting \\"Red Army is with us – the victory is ours!\\" Major exponents Milovan Đilas, one of the major exponents of the Leftist errors Major exponents of this policy included Milovan Đilas, Ivan Milutinović and Boris Kidrič. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia later publicly condemned this policy and punished (by warning them) several local commanders (Petar Drapšin and Miro Popara in Herzegovina and several Montenegrin party leaders). Petar Drapšin was stripped of his rank, removed from all functions in the communist party and its membership. Moša Pijade was held responsible for the adoption of brutal extremist policy of the CPY. On 22 October or in November 1941, Tito dismissed Milovan Đilas from the command of Partisan forces in Montenegro because of his mistakes during the uprising, including his \\"Leftist Errors\\". Tito claimed Đilas made mistakes because he organized a frontal struggle of armies against a much stronger enemy instead of connecting the Partisan struggle with the people's uprising and adopting the partisan methods of resistance. Đilas was appointed as editor of the paper Borba, the Party's main propaganda organ. While Tito repeatedly accused other communist officials from Montenegro for \\"sectarianism\\", Edvard Kardelj admitted to Đilas that \\"grave sectarian errors were made in Serbia in 1941\\" (under Tito's administration).  In literature  In his 1997 work titled Zlotvori, Serbian writer and member of Serbian Academy Dragoslav Mihailović also mentioned leftist errors as mass murder of notable people such as army veterans, teachers and priests.: \\"... ликвидација изведених за време рата четрдесет прве и четрдесет друге године, названих у партији лијева скретања. Тада су многи неопредељени виђенији људи из Црне Горе и Херцеговине - стари ратници, учитељи, попови, ...\\" Svetozar Vukmanović who was a member of Partisan Supreme Headquarters in his 1998 work explained that murders of class enemies by communists in Crmnica reached massive proportions at the beginning of 1942, a day after the Orthodox Christmas. Vukmanović underlined that the Communist leadership in Montenegro pursued the policy of massive murders in whole Montenegro since that period. Yugoslav writer Mirko Kovač published in 2008 a literature work Pisanje ili nostalgija in which he ridiculed some texts about leftist errors stating that every Montenegrin personally saw when Milovan Đilas killed his political enemies.: \\"Otpadnici, disidenti - to su bili monstrumi, a svi ostali časne sestre. Tako je i Đilas promoviran u poglavicu svih ubojica, posebice u Crnoj Gori; predbacivali su mu \\"lijeva skretanja\\" i \\"pasja groblja\\", a gotovo da nema Crnogorca koji ga nije vidio \\" In 2017 a book authored by historians Bošković and Vojinović was published under title The Communist crimes in Montenegro and Herzegovina 1941—1941 in which the authors presented full names of 1,839 victims of red terror in Montenegro and 522 in Herzegovina.

Their purpose is to deliver digital services and technology products. Overview 18F is an office of federal employees within the General Services Administration (GSA) that collaborates with other agencies to improve the user experience of government services by helping them build and buy technology. The group works with government organizations to define a strategy and work towards a solution for their modernization efforts. 18F uses agile and lean methodologies, open source code, and user centered design approaches. Its name refers to its office location in northwest Washington, D.C., on 18th and F Streets. 18F is within Technology Transformation Services, part of the Federal Acquisition Service. In addition to its Washington, D.C office, the agency has offices in New York, San Francisco, and Chicago. History In March 2014, a group of Presidential Innovation Fellows started 18F to extend their efforts to improve and modernize government technology. The United Kingdom created a similar agency in April 2011, Government Digital Service, following their own healthcare IT issues, which saves an estimated $20 million a year over previous methods. 18F runs on a cost recovery model where client agencies reimburse the digital agency for its work. Their operation is closer to a traditional business than government organizations like the DSI Center. 18F's creation was announced by GSA Administrator Dan Tangherlini on March 19, 2014 with a mission to simplify the government's digital services, but no project- specific directive. The agency started with 15 employees, including 11 former Presidential Innovation Fellows from both the private and public sectors. The staff previously worked in front and backend development, design and usability, and product management. The Verge Adrienne Jeffries reported that the agency released a GSA website code update in a half hour, which would normally take weeks or longer. She added that the team did not appear equipped to handle a rollout similar to that of HealthCare.gov. Upon its opening, 18F began to host the Presidential Innovation Fellows program that started in May 2012 in the Digital Government Strategy. An initial list of projects will be drafted in the months following the agency's creation. A possible program called FBOpen, an open source small business and federal contractor interface for bidding on government contracts, was discussed at a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs hearing. On March 19, 2015, 18F and collaborators launched analytics.usa.gov. On September 12, 2015, the group launched the College Scorecard. Other projects of 18F have included myRA for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Every Kid in a Park for the U.S. Department of the Interior, and MyUSA for the General Services Administration, in addition to redesigned websites for the PeaceCorps and Federal Election Commission. All of its projects are open source, meaning anyone can review and suggest updates to the code. The existence of the agency in general and such projects in particular has led to resistance from established government IT firms. In addition, the agency faces the additional challenge of staying fiscally solvent. According to a recent GAO report, 18F is currently spending on average more than $1 million per month more than it recovers. In 2016 alone, the group will receive approximately $33 million for its services, but will spend almost $48 million. 18F is not expected to break even. The following is an update to cost recovery based on FY19 data and was taken from Congressional testimony: “From a FY19 financial standpoint, 18F’s net operating loss was approximately $600k, which translated into an improvement of over $5m from FY18. The loss in FY19 was primarily attributable to the loss of approximately $1.3m in revenue during the government shutdown and limited opportunity to offset costs during this period. Billable utilization rates for 18F increased by 6.6% in FY19 from FY18 and was a primary factor in improved profitability.” See also * Civic technology * Service design * United States Digital Service, at the Executive Office of the President * Government Digital Service, for the UK's counterpart References External links  \\"The Changelog #230: 18F and OSS in the U.S. Federal Government\\". 2016-11-25.

It is a Russian-American co-production (Svarog Films and Afterburner Films), supported by both Russian and American military forces. The film has been described as a \\"Top Gun-style pic\\" about pilots of an elite naval attack squadron. Plot In 2001 in Iraq, two American Navy pilots—Butch Masters and Tom Craig—are ordered to bomb an abandoned plant. The order appears to be false. American experts get killed in the plant. A secret chemical device, called \\"Rainmaker\\", designed for oil field destruction, gets stolen. The military court cannot prove the pilots' intentions, and gives them a dishonorable discharge. After seven years Craig is rich and famous. He manages a private pilot team, working for Top Gun and for movies. Masters is a grease monkey in a small airport. He still tries to investigate his old case, and dreams of his own pilot's team. In order to get a license to fly Russian jets, Masters goes to St. Petersburg, where he meets old friends and new problems. At the same time, a Kurdish militant group plans to capture a part of Northern Iraq and found a new Kurdish state there. They plan to use Rainmaker to destroy oil fields there and make the territory uninteresting for Americans. The terrorists' base is located in Northern Iran, and cannot be reached by the US military. Navy intelligence offers Masters to clear his name by performing a secret off-record mission to Iran with a team of retired pilots. Using unmarked planes, they have to bomb the base and destroy \\"Rainmaker\\".

He is currently the Chairman of AustralianSuper , Australia's largest superannuation fund. Education Don Russell has a PhD from the London School of Economics, a Masters of Economics from the Australian National University and a Bachelor of Economics with first-degree honours from Flinders University. Career Russell joined the Australian Public Service as a Cadet in the Department of the Treasury. Between 1985 and 1993, Russell was principal advisor to then Treasurer Paul Keating. In 1993, Russell was named Ambassador to the United States, based in Washington. He returned to Canberra in 1995 to again work as Principal Adviser to Paul Keating, by then Prime Minister, ahead of the 1996 federal election. Shortly after the Australian Government announced that Russell would be returning to Australia, Russell made comments criticising the Opposition. This led Shadow Foreign Minister Alexander Downer to denounce his actions and call for him to step down immediately. Between 1997 and 2000, Russell worked for the research and money management firm Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. In 2001 he returned to Sydney and took a position with WestLB Asset Management (WestAM). In January 2008, State Super (NSW) appointed Russell as Independent Chairperson. Russell worked at BNY Mellon Asset Management Australia as Global Investment Strategist until March 2010. Russell was appointed to the role of Secretary of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research in June 2011. He managed the Department through several changes of function and Minister as it transitioned to become first the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education and later the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. From November 2011 to November 2012, Russell was a director on the Board of the CSIRO, an Australian Government science and research organisation. He was one of three public servant heads to be sacked by the incoming Abbott Government in September 2013, most likely due to his time as Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating's senior adviser. In June 2014 his appointment to head the South Australia Department of State Development was announced, and he formally commenced work on 4 August. On his appointment, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill praised his \\"strong understanding of how Government can leverage investment and develop the skills required by industry”. In the role, Russell is tasked with leading his department to help industry, business and communities identify and capitalise upon opportunities for job creation and economic growth. Since 2015, Russell has been a member of the South Australia and the Northern Territory State Advisory Council for the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA). Following the March 2018 SA General Election, the victorious Marshall government announced that Russell would be replaced in his public service role.  Resources sector advocacy  In his first public address as Chief Executive of South Australia's Department of State Development Russell advocated for the growth of the state's resources sector. He told a mining conference in Whyalla that “a growing number of successful mines (will) create a virtuous circle supporting an expanding array of industry-backed research initiatives along with exploration and mining service companies.\\" He described the new department's roles to include ensuring that universities \\"turn world-class research into commercial outcomes\\" and that the current regulatory framework is retained in order to facilitate new investment into the state. The South Australian government subsequently announced that \\"Unlocking the full potential of South Australia’s resources, energy and renewable assets\\" was its top economic priority. Awards Russell received the 1995 Flinders University Convocation Medal. In 2005, Russell was added to the distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame of the Faculty of Economics and Commerce at the Australian National University. He has held the Chartered Financial Analyst designation (CFA) since 2007.

Sagalyn (March 2, 1918 – September 11, 2017) was an American journalist, government employee and private consultant.  Biography and career  Arnold J. Sagalyn was born on March 2, 1918 in Springfield, Massachusetts. He graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1939, he became a special assistant for Eliot Ness, who at the time was the safety director of Cleveland, Ohio. He helped Ness in reorganization of the city's police department. In 1942, while working for the Cleveland Press, Sagalyn and the writer William Miller were sent to investigate a suspect in a notorious series of murders, known as the Cleveland Torso Murders case. The suspect from Maysville, Kentucky, known as the \\"Kentucky butcher\\", had committed a grisly murder and, enjoying ties with the local government, served a brief sentence. As the suspect threatened the journalists with an axe, they were unable to interview him. Sagalyn later told this story to James Jessen Badal during making of his book about the Cleveland murders. The same year, Sagalyn came to Washington where he helped to organize a nationwide law enforcement program against prostitution. In the years of military service during the World War II Sagalyn was an aide to the Chief of the Public Safety Division of the Office of Military Government for Germany. There he helped reorganizing the German police system. As a journalist, Sagalyn worked for Life magazine in 1947–1949 and for The New York Times in 1949–1952. He worked as writer and producer for NBC between 1952 and 1954. He was a partner in Mountain Fir Lumber Company next three years and an assistant publisher for Northern Virginia Sun since 1957. Sagalyn was named director of the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Law Enforcement Coordination in 1961, where he advised the Secretary on law enforcement policy and coordinated the operations of the Treasury Department's enforcement agencies. These included the U.S. Secret Service; the Bureau of Narcotics; the Bureau of Customs’ Investigations and Enforcement Division; the Internal Revenue Service's Intelligence, Inspection and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Divisions; and the U.S. Coast Guard's Intelligence Division. He became the Treasury Representative to the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice in 1965. At the same time he served as the Advisor on Public Safety to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In 1967 he served as an associate public safety director for the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. While at the Treasury Department, Mr. Sagalyn served as the US representative for the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) from 1961 to 1967 and was Senior Vice President from 1962 to 1965. In September 1968, Sagalyn left government service, switching to private consulting, working for Arthur D. Little, Inc. In 1970 he founded Security Planning Corporation, a research and consulting firm, specialized in crime prevention and security and risk management. The company was a partnership with his spouse Louise Sagalyn, Peter Labovitz and John Labovitz. By the 1990s he ran the consulting firm Sagalyn Advocates. Sagalyn donated a collection of his papers and books to the American University library in March 2004 and again in July 2012. These papers include his works of 1931–2004, covering primarily the topics of law enforcement, police work, terrorism, and civil disorder, and a memoir published in 2010.  Personal life  Arnold Sagalyn married Louise London (born 1927), a lawyer, in 1957. He had three sisters, Esther S. Bick (1914–2012), Lenore Cohen and Lillian Burack, and three brothers, Julian, Robert and Irwin Sagalyn; all of them predeceased him.

Produced by Spanish producer-DJ duo Cookin' Soul, it was released on 22 June 2012 as the sixth and final single from Orelsan's second studio album Le chant des sirènes. It entered the French Singles Chart at number 143 on 23 June 2012, and has since peaked at number 66. Music video =Background and concept= The music video for \\"Ils sont cools\\" was released on 22 June 2012 on YouTube as part of the single's release. It was directed by David Tomaszewski. The video takes inspiration from the manga universe. Orelsan, being passionate about Japanese culture, drew inspiration from the manga series Knights of the Zodiac for the special effects and the costumes. The two rappers took the place of the knights Pegasus Seiya (Orelsan) and Dragon Shiryū (Gringe). For the scenery, Tomaszewski chose to spend two days at Nîmes at the arena, the Temple of Diane and the Maison Carrée, and one morning at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in Camargue for the ocean scenes. Orelsan and Gringe had to change some of the song's lyrics to fit well with the video. =Synopsis= Gringe (left) and Orelsan before their fusion. \\"Orelsinge\\", the result of the fusion. Orelsan and Gringe are two superheroes preparing themselves for an imminent attack. For most of the video, the two rappers are seen visiting several sites of the city and training themselves, and towards the end they freerun across the Parthenon. In the early stages of the video, 7th Magnitude co-founder Ablaye makes an appearance as a cook in a shawarma restaurant, who is serving the two rappers. The rappers' habitual producer Skread is also seen having a beer at the bar. Towards the end of the video, at the Parthenon, the two are seen looking up to the sky at a giant Sexion d'Assaut member Maître Gims, who looks down at and taunts them from the clouds, after which the two rappers perform a fusion technique, resulting in a transformation that includes Orelsan's hair, Gringe's beard, a combination of their two faces and a monkey's tail. He then goes on to say: \\"Mes amis m'appellent Orelsinge; mes ennemis appellent les renforts.\\" (\\"My friends call me Orelsinge; my enemies call for reinforcements.\\" – \\"Orelsinge\\" is a portmanteau of Orelsan and Gringe; the word \\"singe\\" is French for \\"monkey\\"). Orelsinge is then seen jumping up with his right fist towards the sky, before the video shifts to a clip saying \\"À suivre...\\" (\\"To be continued...\\"). =Cultural references= Several cultural references are made throughout the video.: * The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and their battle cry \\"Kowabunga!\\", which the 2 rappers shout towards the end. * Fist of the North Star (Hokuto no Ken), by citing Kenshiro, the protagonist of the series. * Hunter × Hunter by citing the characters Gon and Killua. * In the middle of the video, Skread is seen pouring himself a beer in the same bar he was in earlier, after which he freezes his glass with his hand and then drinks. This is a reference to Mortal Kombat character Sub-Zero. * The scene where Orelsan gets out of the ocean towards the end of the video is a reference to Daniel Craig's beach scene in Casino Royale as James Bond. * The Orelsinge fusion is a reference to Gogeta from Dragon Ball Z, who is the result of a fusion between Goku and Vegeta. =Reception= The video was nominated for the Trace Urban Music Award for Best Music Video in 2013. On 10 July 2012, an animated video of Orelsinge and Maître Gims doing battle entitled \\"Sharingan\\" was uploaded on YouTube by Chapokane Animation. The animation style is almost identical to that of Dragon Ball Z. In the video, Maître Gims portrays Frieza in his final form (but with Gims' face and skin colour), and as such, he is given the name \\"Gimzer\\" (Frieza's name is \\"Freezer\\" in French versions of Dragon Ball Z), while Orelsinge very closely resembles Goku in the video. Throughout the duration of the video the two are seen performing various techniques seen in Dragon Ball Z, such as Instant Transmission, Goku's Kamehameha and Frieza's Death Ball.

Peffer's poster for Hussy (1980), starring Helen Mirren and John Shea Samuel John Peffer (known as Peff; 3 November 1921 – 14 March 2014) was a British commercial artist who designed film posters, paperback book covers and the covers of home videos. His best known work was for the covers of the paperback James Bond novels published by Pan Books in the 1950s and 1960s, for which he created a consistent and distinctive style.\\"Sam Peffer\\" in The Times, 22 March 2014, pp. 60–61. Early life and war service Peffer was born in Islington, London, into a poor family, the son of an interior decorator. He left school at 13, working first as an errand boy for Leon Goodman Displays, a company that produced front of house displays for cinemas. Soon he moved to Weddell Brothers who produced film publicity materials and when their artist was called up for military service in 1940, Peffer replaced him, painting publicity images of Hollywood film stars.Branaghan, S. & Chibnall, S. (Ed.) (2006) British film posters: An illustrated history. London: British Film Institute, pp. 214-217\\\\. In 1942 he was called up to serve in the Royal Navy during the Second World War. He saw action in Operation Pedestal, the convoys to Malta which was besieged by the Germans. He wrote of an attack on one convoy just after sunset: > Then they came. Little shapes in the distance, growing bigger as they > approached the convoy. Every gun was cocked and ready. All hell broke loose > as they began to dive and the ships began their fire. The noise was > deafening, the guns pounding, the roaring of the engines as the dive-bombers > screamed down at us. Bombs exploded all around, torpedoes were dropped as > the Heinkels and Stukas came out of their dives. It was over quite quickly. No ships were sunk in that attack, but later, a ship on which Peffer was serving was sunk by enemy action. 1950s and 60s On leaving the Navy in January 1946, Peffer considered becoming a professional boxer, a sport in which he had ability, but instead decided to become a commercial artist. He attended a few evening classes at Hornsey School of Art in 1946 immediately after demob but otherwise learned his craft on the job.Sam Peffer Biography MI6 The Home of James Bond 007, 20 October 2007. Retrieved 23 March 2014. He worked for various firms in the film publicity business until eventually joining Pearl and Dean where he was in charge of the art department and knew John Vernon. He married Kitty (Kit) in 1949. In 1954 or 55 Peffer went freelance. He was noticed by the Pan Books art buyer, Tony Bowen-Davies, and in the 1950s and 1960s painted hundreds of book covers, including from 1957 the Ian Fleming novels Casino Royale, Moonraker, From Russia with Love and Dr. No, all for Pan. He was paid about £40 for each one. The model for Bond was Dick Orme. Peffer also created covers for the publishers Arrow, Compact, Corgi, Digit and Panther, amongst others. The Pan paperbacks were selling up to one million copies annually at the time. With the launch of the first Bond film, Dr. No in 1962, however, Pan chose to use film tie-in covers for future editions.The Art Of Sam Peffer MI6 The Home of James Bond 007, 21 October 2007.

Sometimes the same image might appear on more than one book. Together with increased competition in painted covers from younger Italian artists like Renato Fratini, there was a general decline in cover work for artists like Peffer by the end of the 1960s. 1970s and 80s In the 1970s and 1980s, Peffer increasingly turned to quad film posters and home video sleeve design. His breakthrough into this area came when another artist who had too much work recommended Peffer for the poster of Creatures of Evil/Blood Devils in 1971. Peffer then began a busy period until his retirement in 1985 producing around 200 film posters and a similar number of video sleeves as home video became popular slightly later. Although his work was skilled, Peffer was not too fussy about which commissions he accepted, producing art for everything from Bruce Lee Kung Fu films to low budget \\"exploitation\\" films like Desires of a Nymphomaniac and posters for \\"video nasties\\" such as Mountain of the Cannibal God.Branaghan & Chibnall, p. 132 He often worked for Stanley Long, known for his cheap 1970s British sex comedies, and Peffer described himself as the painter for \\"the raincoat brigade\\".

His original design is still in use on DVD releases of the film. By the mid 1980s, film distributors and exhibitors were facing a crisis as audiences in the United Kingdom fell to the lowest level since the Second World War. Demand for traditional painted posters was declining as cinemas used different forms of promotion, printers were closing down and UK based executives of the old school were retiring. With low audiences, US distributors were reluctant to spend money on separate UK publicity campaigns. It was at this time, 1985, that Peffer retired. He described his last year in the business as \\"terrible – there was no work at all\\".Branaghan & Chibnall, pp. 261–263.

An additional two fossil species are known from Cretaceous amber. Siphoniulus species are the only members of the family Siphoniulidae and order Siphoniulida, making Siphoniulida the smallest millipede order. Few specimens are known, and their classification is contentious, although most recent studies place them as basal members of the Helminthomorpha (\\"worm-like millipedes\\"). Description Siphoniulids are small and eyeless.Millipede phylogeny revisited in the light of the enigmatic order Siphoniulida The head is drawn out into a conical beak, and lacks Tömösváry organs. The body is relatively long and narrow, containing up to 51 segments and reaching up to long, and 0.25 mm (0.01 in) wide. The body color ranges from pure white to tan, and has been described as resembling a nematode. The exoskeleton is smooth and has few setae, and ozopores (defensive glands) are lacking. The third segment is legless. Males possess a single pair of gonopods (modified copulatory legs) consisting of the anterior limbs on the seventh segment, and which are partially recessed into the body. The telson (rear-most segment) possesses small bristle-like structures called spinnerets. Distribution S. alba is only known from a single specimen collected in 1894 near Maninjau on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. S. neotropicus was discovered near the Mayan ruins of Tikal in Guatemala, and is also known from the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz. The extinct species S. muelleri and S. preciosus are known from Late Cretaceous Burmese amber. History Siphoniulus alba (and the family Siphoniulidae) was described in 1894 by R. I. Pocock, from a female specimen collected near Maninjau on the island of Sumatra.. The specimen was deposited in the Zoological Museum Amsterdam, but by 1975 the specimen was missing its head and anterior segments. S. neotropicus was described by Richard L. Hoffman in 1979 from two possibly immature females collected in Guatemala. Males of either species were unknown until 2003, when samples of leaf litter from Mexico sorted by researchers at the Field Museum of Natural History revealed new specimens of S. neotropicus, allowing for complete anatomical descriptions and characterization of the gonopods. Classification Siphoniulids have been classified in various, conflicting placements within the Helminthomorpha (\\"worm-like\\" millipedes) since their initial description, and their relation to the rest of millipedes is still unresolved. When first described, the family Siphoniulidae was placed in the \\"Suborder\\" Colobognatha, a group that is now recognized as a larger grouping including the orders Platydesmida, Polyzoniida, and Siphonophorida. The following year, the American entomologist Orator F. Cook considered Stemiulids as \\"suborder Siphoniuloidea\\", closely related to Julidans and Spirostreptidans (a grouping termed Diplochaeata). In 1979, Hoffman placed Siphoniulida (now considered an order) as Helminthomorph incertae sedis, meaning the placement within Helminthomorphs was undetermined, due to the absence of male specimens.Hoffman RL. (1979) Classification of the Diplopoda. Geneve: Mus. Hist. Nat. 237 pp. With only two known species, Siphoniulida is the smallest order of millipedes, followed by Siphonocryptida with three to six species. In more recent years, millipedes have been studied by cladistic and modern phylogenetic methods, yet Siphoniulida remains enigmatic. In the first cladistic study of millipedes, Enghoff could only place Siphoniulids as incertae sedis within the Helminthomorpha, but \\"probably... a specialized subordinate taxon within some juliform or colobognathan order\\". However, in the first morphological study of millipede phylogeny incorporating full details of Siphoniulus anatomy, Siphoniulida did not appear closely related to the Juliformia nor Colobognatha, but rather appeared as an outgroup to all other helminthomorphs, and the internal classification of Helminthomorpha was poorly resolved and significantly differed from Enghoff's. In a subsequent study combining anatomical data with DNA sequence data from other groups, Siphoniulida again appeared as basal within Helminthomorpha.

History As the Kanban method was becoming more popular , Scrumban was developed Ladas, Corey (January 2009). Scrumban: Essays on Kanban Systems for Lean Software Development. Modus Cooperandi Press. as an attempt to make it easier for existing Scrum teams to begin exploring Lean and Kanban concepts . The first article on Scrumban, which uses the spelling \\"Scrum-ban\\", describes several levels to transition from Scrum to Kanban. The Method In Scrumban, the teamwork is organized in small iterations and monitored with the help of a visual board, similar to Scrum and kanban boards. To illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard. In the case of decentralized teams, visual management software such as Assembla, Targetprocess, Eylean Board, JIRA, Mingle or Agilo for Trac are often used. Planning meetings are held to determine what User Stories to complete in the next iteration. The User Stories are then added to the board and the team completes them, the team working on a few User Stories at a time as practical (the work-in-progress, or WIP, limit). To keep iterations short, WIP limits are thus used, and a planning trigger is set in place for the team to know when to plan next - when WIP falls below a predetermined level. There are no predefined roles in Scrumban; the team keeps the roles they already have. =Iterations= Work iterations in Scrumban are kept short. This ensures that a team can easily adapt and change their course of action to a quickly changing environment. The length of the iteration is measured in weeks. The ideal length of an iteration depends on the work process of each team, and it is recommended not to have iterations exceeding two weeks. Velocity (a measure of productivity) is often used by the team to assess issues and trends in its throughput, in order to support continuous improvement. =On-demand planning= The planning in Scrumban is based on demand and occurs only when the planning trigger goes off. The planning trigger is associated with the number of tasks left in the \\"To Do\\" section of the board - when it goes down to a certain number, the planning event is held. The number of tasks that should trigger a planning event is not predefined. It depends on a team's velocity (how quickly it can finish the remaining tasks) and on the time required to plan the next iteration. The tasks planned for the next iteration are added to the \\"To Do\\" section of the board. =Prioritization= It is recommended to prioritize tasks during the planning event. This means the tasks are added to the board with marked priorities. It helps the team members to know which tasks should be completed first and which can be completed later. The prioritization can be done by adding numbers to the tasks or by adding an additional priority column, where the most important tasks are put at the top and the less important tasks below. =Bucket size planning= right Bucket size planning brings the possibility of long-term planning to Scrumban. It is based on the system of three buckets that the work items need to go through before making it on the Scrumban board. The three buckets represent three different stages of the plan and are usually called 1-year, 6-month and 3-month buckets. The 1-year bucket is dedicated for long- term goals that the company has, like penetrating a new market, releasing new product, etc. When the company decides to move forward with a plan, it is moved to the 6-month bucket, where the main requirements of this plan are crystallized. When a company is ready to start implementing the plan, the requirements are moved into the 3-month bucket and divided into clear tasks to be completed by the project team. It is from this bucket that the team draws tasks during their on-demand planning meeting and starts working on the tasks. =The board= A simple kanban boardThe basic Scrumban board is composed out of three columns: To Do, Doing and Done. After the planning meeting, the tasks are added to the To Do column, when a team member is ready to work on a task, he/she moves it to the Doing column and when he/she completes it, he/she moves it to the Done column. The Scrumban board visually represents the progress of the team. The task board columns are adapted and expanded based on the team's work progress. The most common add-ons include priority columns in the To Do section and columns like Design, Manufacturing, Testing in the Doing section. WIP limits -- To ensure that the team is working effectively, Scrumban methodology states that a team member should be working on no more than one task at a time. To make sure this rule is followed Scrumban uses WIP (work in progress) limit. This limit is visualized on top of the Doing section of the board (also could be on each column of that section) and means that only that number of tasks can be in the corresponding column at one time. A WIP limit usually is equal to the number of people in the team but could be expanded based on the specifics of the team's work. To Do limits -- In order to have more productive planning meetings, the number of tasks in the To Do section can be limited as well. The same as with WIP limits, it is written at the top of the To Do section or on top of the corresponding columns and limits the number of tasks in the To Do section or specific columns. =The team= Scrumban does not require any specific number of team members or team roles. The roles a team has prior to adopting Scrumban are kept when implementing Scrumban. They are reinforced by team members having to choose the tasks to complete themselves. The team roles in Scrumban are more specialized and less cross-functional than what is expected in scrum teams. =Pull principle= In Scrumban tasks are not assigned to the team members by the team leader or project manager. Each team member chooses which task from the To Do section they are going to complete next. This guarantees a smooth process flow, where all the team members are equally busy at all times. =Feature freeze= Feature freeze is used in Scrumban when the project deadline is approaching. It means that only the features that the team already has for development can still be worked on and no additional features can be added. =Triage= Triage usually happens right after feature freeze. With an approaching project deadline, the project manager decides which of the in-development features will be completed and which will stay unfinished. This guarantees that the team can focus on finishing important features before the project deadline and forget the less important ones. Terms * Bucket size planning long-term planning approach in Scrumban, which is based on moving the plans through a few steps. * Lead and cycle time the time that is taken from task creation or beginning work on a task to its completion. * On demand planning planning technique that is executed only when there is a need for new tasks on the board. Tooling Like other methods, Scrumban can be implemented with a help of various tools. The most basic Scrumban implementation is a physical whiteboard with sticky notes. Electronic solutions, similar to scrum and kanban electronic boards are available as well. They offer a full automation of the board, where it only has to be updated by the team members. Electronic boards often also provide automatic reports, the possibility of attachments and discussions on tasks, time tracking, as well as integrations with other commonly used project management software.

It is located in the sculptor's four-story historic home on LaGuardia Place in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood and is open to the public. In addition to the artist's sculpture and drawings, it also exhibits important works of American, European, Pre-Columbian and African art that the artist collected. In 2015, the Foundation won a Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation for its contributions as a resource to the downtown community. The townhouse was built in the 1830s and was converted to an industrial loft in the 1880s. The Gross family converted it back into a residential space when they purchased the building in 1963. The first floor is the artist's sculpture studio, featuring a dramatic skylight and an array of tools and materials related to the process of direct carving, which Gross pioneered in America in the late 1920s. Adjacent to the studio is a permanent installation of Gross' sculpture from the 1920s through the 1980s. The second floor features changing exhibits exploring themes in modern American art; past exhibits have examined the photography of sculpture, American surrealism, and direct carving. The Foundation also hosts related programs including artist's talks and poetry readings, as well as joint programs with the SoHo Arts Network, a consortium of downtown arts non-profits founded in 2015. The third floor is the family's living and dining space which remains as it was during the artist's lifetime, featuring a Salon-style installation by Gross of his wide-ranging collection.

The Syrian Army's objective during the battle was to sever the rebels' supply routes for recruits and weapons coming in and out of Lebanon. On the morning of 20 March, fighting started around early dawn with a heavy bombardment of the medieval castle where three-hundred rebels were believed to reside. The town of Hosn itself was also shelled. According to an opposition activist, an agreement for safe conduct of the rebels to Lebanon had been reached the previous day. The military commander leading the battle denied that an agreement had been reached. He stated the military had refused to grant the rebels holed up in the castle safe conduct from the fortress and made the final push into it after seeing the rebels retreating. Another opposition activist countered with claims the military ambushed individuals fleeing Hosn, near the Lebanese border, leaving many dead. Government troops took the castle by the early afternoon. 12 rebel fighters were killed in the engagement inside the castle, including Abu Suleiman Dandashi, an Ahrar ash-Sham brigade commander and Lebanese national. According to military sources, 40–93 rebels were killed as they retreated, including Khaled al-Mahmud, purported to be the leader of the jihadist Jund ash-Sham rebel group. Several soldiers were also killed in the fighting. After the capture of Hosn and the castle, the Army announced that it had regained full control of the western part of the Homs Governorate.

The United States Senate passed it unanimously.\\"Puerto Rico Gets Chance to Write Constitution as Truman Signs Bill\\". The New York Times. July 4, 1950. p. 30. The United States House of Representatives passed it with one dissenting vote, from Vito Marcantonio who preferred full independence. President Harry Truman signed it into law on July 3, 1950. The act was enacted in order to enable the people of Puerto Rico to organize a local government pursuant to a constitution of their own, comparable to those of states and other territories of the United States. From its enactment until this day, the act has served as the organic law for the government of Puerto Rico and its relation with the United States as a whole. Effects The US Congress submitted the act for rejection or approval by the people of Puerto Rico in a referendum held in 1951, where it was approved by voters. As enacted by the act, such approval automatically authorized the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico to call for a constitutional convention in order to draft a constitution for Puerto Rico. Once assembled, this convention prepared a draft for a new constitution that was ultimately approved in a new referendum held on March 3, 1952. That constitution was then ratified by the 82nd United States Congress with a few amendments. This amended constitution was then officially proclaimed on July 25, 1952, immediately going into effect until this very day. Once the constitution came into effect, the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act automatically continued in force and effect the Jones–Shafroth Act, while repealing some of its provisions. These two acts, along with , form the basis for Puerto Rico's government today.

It opened in 1896, and was extended and renovated several times before relocating in 1954 to a new site on the same road. The school was closed down in 1976, but in 1980 became the temporary location of the Avon Valley Church's school. A monument commemorating British colonisation was erected in 1929, and remains in use as a stopping point on the Kep Track. History Clackline School first opened in 1896. On 17 January 1896, Hannah McCarthy was provisionally appointed as the school's mistress. In May 1899, A. P. Lyhane was announced as master of the school. In November 1899, the government allocated Clackline School £275 of expenditure, and on 30 November 1899 the Department of Public Works advertised for tenders for a \\"Clackline School and Quarters\\" contract. The department accepted Stewart and Co.'s tender of £302 19s 3d. In 1908, tenders for additions to the quarters were invited, and the lowest tenderer was D. McDonald. By 1912 the school and quarters required renovations. J. Meredith of Toodyay submitted the lowest tender of £52 17s 6d, which was accepted. In 1915 the school's teachers and children, with the local progress association, organised a charity social event. Gifts sold to benefit the Western Australia Day Fund for the sick and wounded, with £22 1s 8d raised. The event was described as a \\"most successful affair\\", attracting participants from nearby and far away who patriotically fired off silver bullets. Approximately 35 students attended Clackline School in 1920, which had gardens and wheat plots for the children to enjoy. In April 1921 the Public Works Department accepted a tender of £182 15s 6d from A. Woolhouse for further additions to the school. In May of the following year, Edmondson Bros.'s tender of £68 for school quarters and verandahs was accepted. Tenders for renovations of Clackline school were called for in September 1927. On 6 July 1932, the Northam branch of Toc H visited Clackline School. Despite unfavourable weather, they successfully held sports competitions throughout the day, with prizes awarded, followed by entertainment in the evening, attended by children and adults in the public hall. On 12 December 1942, the Clackline School children participated in the dedication and consecration of the Avro Anson Memorial, which commemorates four Royal Australian Air Force airmen killed nearby earlier that year. The children laid wreaths, along with relatives and members of the armed forces. In May 1950, the Minister for Education, Mr Watts, revealed to the Clackline Progress Association that a new school, with a septic tank, was planned for Clackline, with the work to begin as soon as possible. The new school, located a short distance away but still on Great Eastern Highway, opened , the same year the old school closed. The name was also changed to Clackline Primary School. After 22 years, this newer school was shut down in 1976. In 1980, the Avon Valley Church leased the Clackline school site, while awaiting funds to construct a school on land purchased in Northam. The school was the only one in the area north of Perth. Monument The Clackline School lion monument Plaque on the lion monument In 1929, the school's students and headteacher, E.W.Membery commemorated the 100th anniversary of British colonisation by building a monument.

The current CEO of this organization is Ms Sabah AlHaidoos. Silatech means \\"your connection\\" in Arabic. The initiative seeks to create jobs and economic opportunities for young people in the Arab world, targeting 18- to 30-year-olds. by 2016, Silatech claims to have helped 200,000 young Arabs to obtain jobs. The initiative’s model involves building partnerships with governments, private companies and NGOs.  History  Silatech was launched at the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Forum in January 2008 by Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, initially targeting six pilot countries: Bahrain, Morocco, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. The initiative’s $100 million seed capital was donated from the personal funds of Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned and the former emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Operations began in 2009. Founding partners of Silatech include Cisco, Gallup, and ImagineNations. Silatech seeks to harness the \\"youth bulge\\" in the Arab world and tackle youth unemployment - which is as high as 35% in some Arab countries - by promoting the economic empowerment of Arab youth.  Activities  In 2016, Silatech was active in 16 countries, running projects with partners in the areas of microfinance, career advice and employability, small and medium enterprises (SME) development, civic engagement and research and policy advocacy. = Employability = One of Silatech’s first partnerships was with Cisco to create a technology platform for ICT education and youth interaction with prospective employers. Together with Microsoft, Silatech has developed Ta3meel, a set of online training programs and curricula and an online portal that provides skills and employer connections, with the aim of reaching two million young people. An Arabic MOOC (massive open online course) was developed with ALISON, and made available on the Ta3meel employability platform in June 2013. Meanwhile, another initiative, Tamheed, in collaboration with Mindmill, has created an online career guidance platform with psychometric testing, which has been used by young people in Qatar, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Partnering with Tunisiana, the main private telecommunications operator in Tunisia, Silatech launched e-mobile employment platform MobiWorks in 2013, reaching 300,000 Tunisians in less than a month, and offering mobile learning for entrepreneurship, career guidance and financial literacy. Offline, Silatech has supported career counseling, for instance, partnering with the International Youth Foundation in 2012 to provide four days of career guidance training in the West Bank for participants from nine NGOs, universities and colleges in Palestine. Collaborating with Pearson Education’s Edexcel brand, Silatech developed an accredited course and new qualification (Silaqual) for construction industry training in Yemen. The project started in 2009 and at least 1,024 construction workers were trained in 2010. = Financial inclusion = The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor and Silatech hosted a workshop in Rabat on 12-13 March 2013 on youth financial inclusion in the region. In June 2013, Silatech launched a youth savings initiative in Morocco with Al Barid Bank and GIZ called \\"Tawfir al-Ghad\\" (Saving for Tomorrow), with the aim of providing saving accounts and financial literacy training to 30,000 young people. This project was the expansion of a youth micro-savings pilot with Al Amal Microfinance Bank in Yemen, where 11,000 young people opened savings accounts for the first time between 2010 and 2013. The micro-savings project has also expanded to Egypt. = Microfinance = In August 2011, Silatech signed a Memorandum of Understanding to create a fund to support small and medium-sized enterprises, investing $10 million in the fund, with the General Authority for Investment in Egypt. Silatech and UNWRA announced ‘Mubaderati’ (Initiatives) in February 2012, providing a select group of entrepreneurs with financing to help begin their businesses. Silatech guarantees part of the loan, which reduces the risk for UNWRA and young Palestinian borrowers, thereby freeing up millions of dollars worth of additional loans from UNWRA. A partnership with Attawfiq Microfinance in 2012 introduced \\"Boudour\\" (Seed), the first loan product specifically for youths in Morocco, which over 7,000 entrepreneurs had received by June 2013. In 2012, Silatech and the micro- lending platform Kiva partnered to create Kiva Arab Youth, allowing people to make online loans of at least $25 to help fund microentrepreneurs under 30. Silatech matches loans made by the community - initially, this was up to $175,000, but has since been raised to $375,000. Through the Kiva Arab Youth project, $3 million was raised for 2,500 young people by April 2013. In June 2013, Silatech announced it would collaborate with the international payments firm Dahabshiil and the American Red Cross to promote crowdfunding in Somalia using remittance payments. In September 2013, Grameen-Jameel (a joint venture with the Grameen Foundation) joined with Silatech to enable new access to microfinance for young people in countries such as Libya. By 2012, Silatech had raised $35 million of co-funding for microfinance initiatives, had 12 financial institution partners in five countries, and had helped to start or grow 15,000 youth-run businesses, making it the largest supporter of youth microfinance services in the Arab region. \\\\- \\\\- = SME investment = Silatech launched SILA, a network of angel investors to invest in early-stage businesses in Qatar, in partnership with Qatar Development Bank, Wamda, Oasis500 and the MIT Enterprise Forum in October 2012. = Competitions = The winners of the third annual Al Fikra Business Plan Competition were announced in April 2013, with winners receiving unspecified cash prizes, incubation, professional development and managerial and technical advice from Enterprise Qatar. The Al Fikra Business Plan Competition is managed by Enterprise Qatar, with Silatech and the SILA early- stage investment network as co-organizers. Silatech also supported the regional MIT Enterprise Forum Arab Business Plan competition held in April 2013. In 2014, Silatech held the first Arab Mobile App Challenge in partnership with the Applied Innovation Institute and Ooredoo. Workshops were held in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the UAE in late 2013, followed by competitions in these countries in January 2014, with the top three entries from each country sent to the finals in Doha. The winners, who were announced on 2 February 2014, earned prizes of $50,000, $30,000 and $20,000, and one team from each country was selected to compete at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. = Conferences = Silatech has been active in organising conferences at national and regional levels. On 11-12 January 2012, Silatech brought 300 Libyan youth and government officials together in Benghazi to discuss youth empowerment, which resulted in the creation of the National Youth Leadership Council. On 16–18 February 2013, Silatech organized the Arab Youth and Entrepreneurship Conference in Qatar with The Arab Urban Development Institute and in partnership with the World Bank. The conference brought 300 people together to discuss the challenges facing young entrepreneurs and the ways in which local governments, NGOs and the private sector could come together to support young entrepreneurs. Silatech organized a conference on 16-17 October 2013 at UC Berkeley’s Fung Institute to bring figures from the Arab world together with scholars, venture capitalists, and Silicon Valley innovators. Silatech has also supported Global Entrepreneurship Week; in Qatar in November 2013, and the first ever such event in Libya also held in November 2013. = Research = In 2008, a collaboration between Silatech, FTSE Group and the Qatar Financial Markets Authority (QFMA) created a new index project, supporting individual exchanges across the Arab World to launch small and medium enterprises markets. Joining with the Wolfensohn Center for Development at the Brookings Institution, the Dubai School of Government and the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut, Silatech launched \\"Taqeem\\" in June 2009, a project to assess the impact of current policy and investment in the areas of employment and entrepreneurship, and to identify, scale and promote best practices. Silatech collaborates with Gallup to investigate youth attitudes to employment and entrepreneurship across the region in the ‘Silatech Index.’ Since 2008, twice-yearly reports have sought to measure and quantify youth opinions in three areas: job creation and availability, access to resources required to find jobs, and policies blocking their success. In 2012, Silatech collaborated with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor and Sanabel to survey regional microfinance institutions, identifying gaps in youth financial inclusion and seeking to use the information to improve policy. = Civic engagement = In January 2014, Silatech and Innovations in Civic Partnership launched a program allowing universities in Egypt, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia and Yemen to apply for grants assisting institutional change and improving civic engagement. In February 2014, Silatech and Innovations in Civic Partnership convened a forum in Amman, Jordan, for more than 40 university presidents and senior administrators to discuss integrating civic engagement into higher education.  Organizational governance  Rick Little was CEO of Silatech from its founding in 2008, until July 2011. Tarik Yousef subsequently took over as CEO of Silatech. Silatech’s current members of the board of trustees are Martti Ahtisaari, David Bell, Rick Little, Hessa Al Jaber, Nemir Kirdar, Ahmad Mohamed Ali Al-Madani and Mohammed Al Naimi, with Sheikha Mozah as chair. In 2012, the Cisco CEO John Chambers was also a board member. In 2011, Mary Robinson, Nabil Kuzbari and Khaled Bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah were board members (along with the current board members Martti Ahtisaari, David Bell and Rick Little), when Ameera al-Taweel joined the board in April 2011. In 2009, John Chambers and Wim Elfrink of Cisco and Ratan Tata were also board members. Board meetings have been held in Tunis on 17 January 2012, and in Rabat on 9 June 2013. The extent to which the board of directors is involved in decision- making and the governance of Silatech is unclear.  Criticisms of Silatech  The U.S. diplomatic mission in Qatar expressed concerns that other Arab governments may not see Silatech as separate from the Qatari government, even though Silatech staff claim the organization is just an NGO that happens to based in Qatar. A representative from Silatech is one of five members of the board of directors of the Qatar Development Fund appointed by royal decree, while the board's chairman is Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2013 to 2016. Elsewhere, Silatech has been highlighted as a way for Qatar to wield soft power and \\"channel money into populist causes and present itself once more as a force for good in the region\\". While the royal family was said to have started Silatech with $100 million of its own funds, this is difficult to fully ensure given the \\"blurred lines between the wealth of state figures and the state itself\\".

Farmer William J. Fullerton built the dam across Turkey Creek in the mid-1890s to irrigate the vegetable crops on his farm. As western Oklahoma was a dry region, farmers depended on a regular water supply to produce crops, making Fullerton's dam an important innovation. The dam was the first gravity flow dam built by a European settler in western Oklahoma, and Fullerton became a successful regional farmer due to his effective irrigation system. It is even more notable because Fullerton designed the system himself using a homemade transit, and the system was built using unskilled manual labor and mules. . The main irrigation channel was built of limestone blocks and was up to wide and up to deep. The channel ran to the east and th the south.National Register of Properties in Oklahoma: Fullerton Dam. Accessed September 24, 2015. In addition, the reservoir which the dam created became a popular local attraction. However, Fullerton's farm began to fail around 1905 because of falling produce prices and increasing production expenses. Several land developers offered to buy him out but he refused the offers. He had to borrow a large amount of money to stay in business, and was heavily in debt when he died in 1916. His whole operation was sold to satisfy creditors. The dam broke permanently during a 1919 flood. The stone ruins remain at the site of the dam and are generally in the same condition as they were following the flood. The site of the dam was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1976.

With its growth came an expansion in city services, notably the fire department. A number of new stations were constructed from 1910 through 1929, many of which are still standing. Together, ten of these historic fire stations are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Historic Fire Stations of Birmingham Multiple Property Submission. History Birmingham's first volunteer fire station was established in December 1871, shortly after the city was incorporated. The city purchased its first fire engine in 1873 after a large fire affected the city. The modern fire department was founded in 1885 with two stations. It had grown to employ 21 firemen and 15 horses by 1890. During the early 20th century, although Birmingham spent less money per capita on services than similarly-sized Southern cities, it spent more on fire and education. The insistence on first-class fire protection came from downtown business leaders; better fire coverage kept their insurance rates low. In 1910 Birmingham annexed a number of suburban towns, more than doubling the city's population. Soon after, residents in the suburbs began to demand better fire protection, leading to many new stations being constructed; by 1929 there were 24 fire stations in Birmingham. Architecture Stations built before 1920 tended to be in the central business districts of the suburban towns, and their architecture reflected the commercial styles of their surroundings, with little decoration. Similarly, stations built after 1920 were primarily in residential areas, and were built in styles popular at the time, including Spanish Revival, Tudor Revival, and Beaux-Arts. {border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" -bgcolor=\\"#A8EDEF\\" !

In an effort to blend in with its more affluent surroundings, it is designed in a Beaux-Arts style, and more ornamented than most of its counterparts. The façade is dominated by three garage doors, each topped with a decorated arch and complemented by three six-over-six windows on the second floor. The entrance door to the left of the garage doors is surrounded by a decorated arch and topped with a cartouche. See also: It still functions as an active firehouse. - id=\\"Fire Station No. 6\\"  Fire Station No. 6  100px  1906  317 15th St., N.  Station No. 6 is the oldest remaining fire station in Birmingham. Built in 1906 to serve Jewish and African-American neighborhoods at the edge of downtown, its utilitarian style matched the buildings in its area. Originally the building had two arched garage doors, but one has been bricked over. A simple entrance door lies between the two bays and a large \\"No 6\\" is painted above it. Stone sills underline the windows, a set of three above each garage door with a smaller window between them on the façade, and two pairs on each floor on the west side of the building. See also: It has been used to house the Firehouse Shelter, a homeless shelter, since 1983. - id=\\"Fire Station No. 10\\"  Fire Station No. 10  100px  1927  4120 2nd Ave., S.  Typical of suburban firehouses, Station No. 10 in the Avondale neighborhood is built in a style reflective of its surroundings. Unlike the urban stations, No 10 is a one-story, Spanish Revival building, built in 1927. The two garage door bays anchor the left of the main façade, with an entrance and gable roofed meeting room to the right. The living area lies to the rear. Though it has been thoroughly modernized — it was an active station until 2009 — with aluminum windows and rollup doors and a stucco exterior, the station retains its original character. See also: -id=\\"Fire Station No. 11\\"  Fire Station No. 11  100px 100px  1910  1250 13th St., N.  A former fire station built in 1910 in the working-class Fountain Heights neighborhood, Station No. 11 was built in a commercial style, in contrast to later suburban stations. The garage door, later partially covered with brick, sat on the left side of the building next to a central entrance door. A brick belt over the office portion of the building and an awning over the doors are the only decorative elements on the building. See also: Its replacement, the current Fire Station No. 11, is at 4601 Bessemer Super Highway. -id=\\"Fire Station No. 12\\"  Fire Station No. 12  100px 100px 100px  1927  15 57th St., S.  The former Station No. 12 in Woodlawn is a Tudor Revival structure built of stone. An L-shaped building, the two-story residential portion meets the one- story, double gable-roofed garage at a conical tower. The tower contains a spiral staircase with two-over-two-over-two windows along it, giving an offset appearance from the outside. The garage opens to an alley rather than directly onto the main street. See also: The station was renovated and now houses the Birmingham Dream Center, a church outreach ministry. The current Fire Station No. 12 is at Woodlawn 6449 First Avenue North. -id=\\"Fire Station No. 15\\"  Fire Station No. 15  100px  1929  1345 Steiner Ave., SW.  The former Station No. 15 is an urban commercial-styled building in a residential portion of the Arlington neighborhood. The garage door is flanked by two entrances, one false door leading to the side of the building. Above the garage door sits a false balcony below a large second-floor window. The west side of the building has a false arched entrance and features vents along the parapet roof line. See also: The current Fire Station No. 15 is at West End 1725 Jefferson Avenue. -id=\\"Fire Station No. 16\\"  Fire Station No. 16  100px  1926  1621 Ave. G  The former Station No. 16 in Ensley is an example of a mixed-use station in a suburban area. The station, which incorporates Spanish Revival elements, also served as the community's police station and jail. Two one-story wings on the street corner comprised the fire station, with a courtyard between the two. The garage wing features a terra cotta shed roof, and the office wing has three arched entrances on the façade. The two-story police station and jail has a parapet roof topped with terra cotta tiles and a stucco band. Six-over- six double-hung windows adorn both floors. See also: The current Fire Station No. 16 is at 2001 Avenue I, Ensley. -id=\\"Fire Station No. 19\\"  Fire Station No. 19  1925  7713 Division Ave.  Station No. 19 was erected in 1925 after a fire in the community. The Romanesque Revival building is constructed of light brown brick and stone. The two-story living and office area lies behind the single-story garage area. The garage doors are recessed and surrounded by stone brackets. Quoins adorn the corners of the building. See also: A public library, which had begun in and older fire station in 1914, was built next to the station in 1926. The station is still an active fire station. -id=\\"Fire Station No. 22\\"  Fire Station No. 22  100px  1927  3114 Clairmont Ave.  Station No. 22 was built in 1927 on the eastern edge of the Highland Park neighborhood. The main feature of the Spanish Revival building is a two-story tower square tower facing the intersection of Clairmont Avenue and 32nd Street. The building has been extensively modified; the original stucco has been resurfaced, the tile roof was replaced with asphalt shingles, and the garage door has been replaced with a large window. See also: A new station, combining No. 10 with No. 22, was opened in 2009, and the old No. 22 was converted to a restaurant and hair salon in 2011. -id=\\"Wylam Fire Station\\"  Wylam Fire Station  1910  NE Corner 8th Ave. and Huron St.  In contrast to many of the other historic stations, the Wylam Fire Station is built in a restrained commercial style of dark red brick. Built in 1910, when the town of Wylam was annexed into Birmingham, the station features large, wooden double garage doors with decorative metal hinges. Three six- over-six wood-frame windows sit over the door, with a stone panel above. The east and west sides of the building feature six windows on each floor, steel frame on the first and wood on the second.

In 2012, Grimble shared starts with fellow tight end Randall Telfer. He started in nine games, appearing in all 12, recording 29 catches for 316 yards (10.9 avg.) with five touchdowns, and was named an honorable mention All-Pac-12. In 2013, he caught 25 passes for 271 yards and two touchdowns, and was named an All-Pac-12 selection for the second consecutive season. On January 7, 2014, Grimble announced he would forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2014 NFL Draft. Professional career Coming out of USC, analysts projected Grimble to be a seventh round selection or priority undrafted free agent. He was ranked as the 17th best tight end prospect available in the draft by DraftScout.com. Most analysts gave him positive reviews for his good hands, good frame, and ability to maintain possession while taking shots down the middle of the field. = New York Giants = Grimble went undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft, but received contract offers as an undrafted free agent from the Washington Redskins, Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers, and New York Giants.

Higher Education in the Arab world is non- compulsory, formal education that occurs after secondary education in the twenty-two Arab states. The Arab world is home to one of the oldest universities in the world, Al-Azhar University, established in the tenth century C.E. in Cairo. Initially founded as a center for men to study Islamic law and theology, Al-Azhar now offers many academic disciplines to both male and female students. Al-Azhar aside, contemporary higher education in the Arab world is often traced back to colonial and missionary universities established by Europe and the United States in the early nineteenth century. These institutions were few in number, and access was limited to upper-class individuals living in major cities.Mazawi, Andre Elias (2005). “Contrasting perspectives on higher education governance in the Arab states,” in Higher Education: Handbook of Theory and Research, 20: 133-189. Higher education in the region has grown dramatically and has experienced many changes, since its beginnings in the colonial period, and especially since the middle of the twentieth century. Though significant differences exist between higher education sectors in each country of the Arab world, some general trends are evident, including navigating the forces of globalization and attempts to increase access and gender equality. Despite significant changes, Arab universities continue to receive relatively poor evaluations from the major global university-ranking systems. Contemporary history American University of Beirut students on campus. Until the middle of the twentieth century, ten universities existed in the region, including the American University of Beirut (then called Syrian Protestant College), Université Saint Joseph in Beirut, Cairo University (then called the Egyptian University), University of Algeria, and University of Damascus (then called Syrian University). With the decline of official European colonialism and the independence of Arab countries after WWII, higher education institutions and student enrollment quickly multiplied. While pre-independence institutions were primarily private and foreign-operated, post-independence universities were largely public, state-run institutions. During this period a clear hierarchy among academic disciplines was developed; students with higher grades in secondary school were admitted into the science faculties, while “weaker” students were placed into social sciences, humanities, and Islamic studies. Instability, globalization, and a general economic downturn in many Arab countries led to new reformist trends in higher education beginning in the 1980s and continuing today. The various reform movements are debated among the various stakeholders (governments, local and foreign institutions, students, citizens), and take on different characteristics in each Arab country. These (not always successful) reforms and trends include increasing privatization, calls for greater access, improving the capability of universities to meet the demands of society, matching educational “outputs” with labor market needs, and negotiating a competitive global education market.Bhandari, Rajika and El-Amine, Adnan (2012). Higher Education Classification in the Middle East and North Africa, New York, NY: Institute of International Education. There has been tremendous growth in higher education in the Arab world since the last years of the twentieth century. Student enrollment has jumped from roughly 3 million students in 1998/99 to about 7.5 million students in 2007/08, while the number of universities has grown almost three-fold in the same time period. Higher education in the region has also trended toward increased privatization, though considerable differences occur between countries; Bahrain, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, and the UAE have the highest percentage of students enrolled in private universities (above 50 percent), while Iraq, Libya, Morocco, and Sudan have the lowest percentage of enrollment in private universities (20 percent or less). In universities today, Islamic studies, social sciences, and the humanities are typically taught in Arabic, while “hard” sciences, technology, and medicine are usually taught in English or French (based on previous colonial rulers). Instruction in Arabic is almost exclusively carried out in Modern Standard Arabic, as opposed to the various colloquial dialects. Some countries have proposed – and to various degrees, enacted – policies to increase the amount of instruction in Arabic. This so-called “Arabization” of higher education is a highly contested issue that is infused with a variety of political and cultural debates in different Arab countries. Globalization As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, education has been identified by many as the essential means of preparing citizens to compete in a “knowledge-based” global economy. In higher education, globalization and rising inter-connectivity is manifested in a variety of trends, such as a growing number of students who receive degrees from universities outside their country of origin, the increasing number of students, especially from the U.S., who participate in “study abroad” programs,Hoffa, William and DePaul, Steven (2010). \\"Introduction,\\" in Hoffa and DePaul (Eds) A History of U.S. Study Abroad: 1965-Present, A special publication of Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad, 1-13. the emergence of international “branch” campuses, the presence of international faculty, and global higher education ranking systems. Globalization strategies worldwide have led to an increasingly homogenized higher education sector, as governments and institutions seek to meet global standards.Donn, Gari and Al Manthri, Yahya (2010). Globalisation and Higher Education in the Arab Gulf States, Oxford: Symposium Books. Furthermore, some scholars have argued that increasing globalization has actually led to a contemporary form of imperialism, in which economic and cultural norms and discourses are imposed by dominant nations on weaker nations.Hardt, M. and Negri, A. (2003). “Globalization as Empire,” in D. Held and A. McGrew (Eds) The Global Transformations Reader: an Introduction to the Globalization Debate, Cambridge: Polity Press, 11-119.Yang, R. (2003). “Globalisation and Higher Education Development: A Critical Analysis,\\" International Review of Education, 49(1), 269-291. In recent years, member states of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have been debating the application of the General Agreement on Trades in Services (GATS) to the field of higher education. This free-trade policy affects the status of non-national education providers, including the recognition of degrees earned from such institutions, and has implications on access to and quality of education, economic development and innovation. Arab members of the WTO have been hesitant to negotiate trade agreements related to GATS and the free trade of educational services (though several Arab countries allow foreign institutions to operate within their borders). Among the concerns shared by opponents of the free trade of education is the possibility that GATS will marginalize or eliminate national universities that cannot compete financially with trans- national institutions; that the rise of non-national institutions will erode the native cultural aspects of education; and that a free-trade educational environment would reduce access to higher education and become an “elitist system.” Proponents of GATS, meanwhile, argue that the free-trade policy will lead to increased efficiency, improved educational programs, and lower costs for students. A building on the campus of Education City in Doha, Qatar. The Arab States of the Persian Gulf – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates – have embraced the “Western” model of higher education perhaps more than any other Arab country. In countries such as Qatar and UAE, this embrace is reflected by a multitude of foreign “branch” campuses, particularly in Education City in Qatar, and Dubai Academic City. Roughly one-third of all international branch campuses are located in the Arab world, with the vast majority in the Persian Gulf region - and especially in Qatar and UAE. One reason for the growth of foreign branch campuses is Arab leaders' willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in the projects. Scholars have identified other important explanations for this trend, such as the need to provide a growing youth population with educational options that will prepare them to succeed in a global, knowledge-based economy. Kuwait has limited options to choose government run institutes but wide range of private universities. These Private Universities in Kuwait are with impressive campuses, infrastructure and modern facilities. All of them are fast growing, owned by business houses, focus on local students and are affiliated with western universities in some way. However, they fail to impress global ranking. Private University Council (PUC) is government body which controls private universities in Kuwait. The Universities in Bahrain are unable to make it to the top places in Arab World. Political leaders in Arab states of the Persian Gulf are utilizing specialized \\"Western\\" universities to compete with local institutions and fill the gaps in their educational programs. And though Persian Gulf countries are also increasingly sending their citizens overseas to study, the branch campuses provided more options for those students who cannot - for a variety of reasons - go abroad to study.Hanauer, Elizabeth and Phan, Anh-Hao (2011).Middle East: Global Higher Education's Boldest Step, University World News Cassidy highlights several areas that Arab higher education institutions must address in order to effectively train students in the contemporary, globalized era, including the ability to effectively utilize new technologies, the capability and willingness to collaborate on a global scale, and the flexibility to adapt in variable circumstances. Some scholars and educators have pushed the conversation further, wondering whether universities across the globe should develop universal standards and benchmarks. Some educators argue that standardization would help universities develop along an educational \\"road map,\\" while others maintain that diversification is a great strength of higher education, and even doubt that such global standards could be developed; other education professionals, meanwhile, contend that the global ranking systems are already beginning to fill the role of global standardization.Fischer, Karin (2014). Seeking Global Quality Control for Universities, Al-Fanar Media. Gender equality and access Gender equality in higher education varies from country to country and has changed over time.Kirdar, Serra (2007). “The Impact of Educational Empowerment on Women in the Arab World.” In C. Brock and L. Levers (Eds), Aspects of Education in the Middle East and North Africa, Oxford: Symposium Books, 39-56. In Bhandari and El-Amine's study of seven Arab countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, UAE), the researchers found that men and women each comprise about 50 percent of higher education enrollment. There are, however, significant differences between universities; for example, a handful of universities in the Persian Gulf countries are designated for a single gender (male-only or female-only), and so female enrollment ranges from zero (male-only) to 100 percent (female- only). Some universities, particularly in Saudi Arabia, admit both men and women but have separate campuses for each gender, while other universities allow both genders on the same campus but teach them in separate classrooms. About 85 percent of the universities analyzed in this study are entirely co- educational. The researchers identified Morocco and Lebanon as the countries with the highest level of gender equity in terms of enrollment and co- education. In a separate study examining Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia, Kirdar has argued that despite large enrollment numbers among women in Arab universities – as well as many Arab women studying in Europe and the U.S. – patriarchal restrictions have prevented many women from parlaying high levels of education into social and political authority. Other scholars are similarly noted that tertiary education does not necessarily lead to higher levels of female involvement or success in politics or the workforce.Findlow, Sally (2007). “Women, Higher Education and Social Transformation in the Arab Gulf.” In C. Brock and L. Levers (Eds), Aspects of Education in the Middle East and North Africa, Oxford: Symposium Books, 57-76.Megahed, Nagwa and Lack, Stephen (2011). “Colonial Legacy, Women’s Rights, and Gender Educational Inequality in the Arab World with Particular Reference to Egypt and Tunisia.” International Review of Education, 57(3-4): 397-418.Jansen, Willy (2006). “Gender and the Expansion of University Education in Jordan.” Gender and Education, 18(5): 473-90. Some scholars are also concerned that women, while enrolling in relatively large numbers across much of the Arab world, are over-represented in such fields as arts, humanities, education, and nursing, and under-represented in professional and scientific fields. In Egypt, for example, women represent roughly 72 percent of the total enrollment in the fields of Arts, humanities, and education, while comprising less than 30 percent of the total enrollment in engineering. Others have argued that while gender equality in higher education has improved dramatically in recent decades,Acedo, C. (2011). “Achievements and Challenges of Higher Education in Arab Countries.” Prospects, 41(1): 1-3. equitable access to higher education remains a problem among the poor members (both men and women) of many Arab countries. Global rankings Arab universities have little representation in the major university-ranking systems – Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), World University Rankings (WUR), and QS World University Rankings (QS). ARWU is compiled by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and lists the top 500 universities. Universities are ranked 1-500, with 1-100 individually ranked, 101-200 ranked in groups of 50 (101-150, 151-200), and the remainder are ranked in groups of 100 (201-300, 301-400, 401-500). ARWU gauges performance using a variety of markers, including the number of Nobel Prize-winners among alumni and faculty, number of published papers in academic journals, number of references to papers published by university faculty, and per capita academic performance. The top-ranked Arab university in ARWU is King Saud University (Saudi Arabia), at #151-200. The remaining ranked Arab universities are King Abdulaziz University (Saudi Arabia, #201-300); King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (Saudi Arabia, #301-400); Cairo University (#401-500); and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (Saudi Arabia, #401-500). WUR is produced by Times Higher Education, which utilizes 13 “performance indicators” across five general fields: teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international outlook. Universities are ranked 1-400, with 1-200 individually ranked, 201-300 ranked in groups of 25 (201-225, 226-250, etc.), and 301-400 ranked in groups of 50 (301-350, 351-400). There are only two Arab universities ranked in the top 400 of WUR, both in Saudi Arabia: King Abdulaziz University (#351-400), and King Saud University (#351-400). There are, however, a few more universities ranked in the separate “Asia University Rankings”: King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (Saudi Arabia, #62); United Arab Emirates University (#86); and American University of Beirut (#87). The QS rankings, produced by Quacquarelli Symonds, uses six indicators to rank universities: academic reputation (as determined from surveys), employer reputation (as determined from surveys), faculty-student ratio, citations per faculty, proportion of international students, and proportion of international faculty. Universities are ranked 1-800, with 1-399 individually ranked, and 400-800 ranked into progressively larger groups (the final 100 are simply ranked as 700+). The top-ranked Arab university is again in Saudi Arabia: King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (#216). The QS rankings include the highest number of ranked Arab universities, mostly because this system ranks many more universities (800) than either ARWU (500) or WUR (400). Arab universities ranked by QS are: American University of Beirut (#250); King Saud University (Saudi Arabia, #253); American University in Cairo (#348); King Abdulaziz University (Saudi Arabia, #360); United Arab Emirates University (#421-430); American University of Sharjah (UAE, #431-440); Al-Imam Mohamed Ibn Saud Islamic University (Saudi Arabia, #491-500); Sultan Qaboos University (Oman, #501-550); Cairo University (#551-600); Qatar University (#551-600); Umm Al-Qura University (Saudi Arabia, #551-600); Abu Dhabi University (UAE, #601-650); Ain Shams University (Egypt, #601-650); King Khalid University (Saudi Arabia, #601-650); Université Saint Joseph (Lebanon, #601-650); Al Azhar University (Egypt, #651-700); Jordan University of Science and Technology (#651-700); Alexandria University (Egypt, #700+); King Faisal University (Saudi Arabia, #700+); Kuwait University (#700+); University of Baghdad (#700+); University of Bahrain (#700+); and University of Jordan (#701+). The three major ranking systems subdivide their rankings into major world regions, QS World University rankings now publishes a regional ranking for the \\"Arab Region\\". In an attempt to address the lack of a distinct Middle East/North Africa region, IIE published the Higher Education Classification in the Middle East and North Africa, in 2012, which surveys the higher education sectors in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. The study evaluates six dimensions of higher education in these countries: institutional characteristics (i.e. public or private), curriculum organization/system, student profile, cultural orientation (Arab, American, French, or British), regional engagement, and international engagement. The study encountered several obstacles in collecting data, including a reluctance to participate on the part of governments and institutions, lack of centralized institutional data, and political instability (the study was developed during and after the major protests in 2011; for this reason, Egypt was excluded from the study completely). While university rankings are influential - often being utilized by institutions to develop future policies - and widely discussed by those in academia,Labi, Aisha (2013). University Rankings Proliferate, Along with New Uses for the Data They Collect, The Chronicle of Higher Education. many scholars and educators are critical of the rankings' usefulness. In general, critics argue that the rankings are highly subjective and the methodologies are faulty. Among the most common criticisms of the rankings are: that they rely too heavily on \\"reputation,\\" a subjective marker that is determined by worldwide surveys of academics and administrators; that many regions of the world outside the U.S. and Western Europe are underrepresented in the surveys; that \\"research impact\\" is too focused on quantity of publications and not quality; that student and employer perspectives are notably absent from the ranking methodologies; and that noble prize-winners are given a disproportionate amount of weight in the methodologies (particularly in the ARWU rankings).Labi, Aisha (2010). 'Times Higher Education' Releases New Rankings, But Will They Appease Skeptics?, The Chronicle of Higher Education.Marmolejo, Francisco (2010). The Madness of Rankings, The Chronicle of Higher Education.Labi, Aisha (2011). Review of University Rankings Offers a Comprehensive Critique of the Process, The Chronicle of Higher Education. Some scholars and educators in the Arab world have joined in the critique of the rankings, sharing the concern that the supposed \\"objective\\" rankings are really quite subjective, and further arguing that the rankings are biased in favor of Western universities. Others in the Arab world have pointed to a lack of financial resources (especially outside the Arab States of the Persian Gulf), difficulties publishing research in English-language journals, and the limited ability of Arab scholars to participate in international conferences and collaborations as important factors that explain Arab universities' poor showing in the rankings.McPhedran, Charles (2013). Are University Rankings Relevant to the Arab World?, Al-Fanar Media. The fact that Saudi Arabia boasts the top Arab university in each of the three ranking systems is often attributed to high levels of government funding for education, an emphasis on research in the science and engineering fields.McPhedran, Charles (2013).

Mbeki criticized the scientific consensus that HIV does cause AIDS beginning shortly after his election to the presidency. In 2000, he organized a Presidential Advisory Panel regarding HIV/AIDS including several scientists who denied that HIV caused AIDS. In the following eight years of his presidency, Mbeki continued to express sympathy for HIV/AIDS denialism, and instituted policies denying antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients. The Mbeki government even withdrew support from clinics that started using AZT to prevent mother-to- child transmission of HIV. He also restricted the use of a pharmaceutical company's donated supply of nevirapine, a drug that helps keep newborns from contracting HIV. Instead of providing these drugs, which he described as \\"poisons\\", shortly after he was elected to the presidency, he appointed Manto Tshabalala-Msimang as the country's health minister, who promoted the use of unproven herbal remedies such as ubhejane, garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice to treat AIDS, which led to her acquiring the nickname \\"Dr. Beetroot.\\" These policies have been blamed for the preventable deaths of between 343,000 and 365,000 people from AIDS. Since 2008, Mbeki has been silent about his views and policies on AIDS; according to The New York Times, his spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, said Mr. Mbeki would not discuss his thinking on HIV and AIDS, explaining that policy decisions were made collectively by the cabinet and so questions should be addressed to the government. Upon becoming president in 2008, Mbeki's successor, Kgalema Motlanthe, appointed Barbara Hogan as health minister to replace Tshabalala-Msimang on the first day of his presidency. Hogan told The New York Times, \\"The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa.\\" Origin The reason Mbeki became so enamored with HIV/AIDS denialism remains unclear, but some have suggested that it was influenced by Christine Maggiore meeting with him in the 1990s. Another factor may have been when, in 1999, Anthony Brink published an article entitled \\"A Medicine from Hell\\", which described AZT as dangerous and ineffective. Brink would later claim that this article was responsible for Mbeki's policies banning the use of the drug. Brink contacted Mbeki after the article was published, and was welcomed as an expert. Mbeki, in a 2002 document of which he was the co- author, also cited John le Carré's novel The Constant Gardener as influencing his fear of pharmaceutical companies and their influence on scientific research. Given that Mbeki explicitly accused supporters of the consensus position on HIV/AIDS of racism, it has also been proposed that his denialist views arose from a history of racist portrayals of black people in South Africa under the apartheid system. An article in Race & Class by Joy Wang proposes that both of these factors influenced Mbeki's embrace of AIDS denialism, and cites Frantz Fanon's essay \\"Medicine and Colonialism\\" to explain what Wang describes as \\"...the impasse between scientists and Mbeki's government.\\" Martin Asser has also proposed that Mbeki's views on AIDS may have been influenced by the high price of ARV therapy relative to the relatively small amount of money his country's citizens have at their disposal. In 2004, Theodore F. Sheckels of Randolph-Macon College argued that Mbeki, while discussing HIV/AIDS as president of South Africa, attempted to portray \\"the West\\" as the scapegoat in order to unite the country's black majority. Barton Gellman has proposed an alternative explanation for Mbeki's views—namely, that he is \\"a sort of restless, roving intellect who likes to surf the Internet and is accustomed to being a dissident who allies himself against establishments. After all, he spent his whole adult life fighting apartheid.\\" He also noted that even if Mbeki followed every recommendation of the mainstream scientific community regarding AIDS he still wouldn't solve the problem, so, according to Gellman, Mbeki is \\"keeping the scientific uncertainties alive because he doesn't want to portray himself as helpless.\\" Timeline =1994= On May 10, 1994, Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa, remaining in that office until replaced by Thabo Mbeki five years later. During his presidency, which lasted from then until 1999, Mandela remained largely indifferent to HIV/AIDS, and did not speak out about the danger it posed to South Africa until the early 2000s. Mandela has himself reportedly expressed regret that he did not do more to combat AIDS during his presidency. =1997= In early 1997, Mbeki, who was then the Deputy President of South Africa, approached the other members of the African National Congress to pitch the idea of using a new anti-AIDS drug, developed in South Africa, called Virodene. The advantages over existing ARV drugs which proved appealing to Mbeki included being 200 times less expensive than antiretroviral triple therapy, and the possibility of bypassing the Western medical establishment if it was proven to work. This led to a group of AIDS patients who had been treated with Virodene being invited to testify before the Cabinet of South Africa. Their testimonies included many statements that they had gained weight and seen boils on their faces vanish after they started being treated. However, the fact remained that the makers of Virodene had previously been denied a license by the South African Medicines Control Council (MCC). The company argued that this happened because the South African AIDS establishment did not want any drugs other than ARVs to become available, because the establishment was funded by Western drug firms. Mbeki found this argument compelling. The drug was then legalized and heavily and favorably promoted in the popular media, until it became apparent that it posed a severe health hazard. The MCC subsequently declared the drug unfit for human consumption. =1999= June On June 14, 1999, Mbeki was elected President of South Africa. October On October the 28th, Mbeki gave a speech to the National Council of Provinces in which he touched upon the issue of HIV/AIDS, and especially whether his government should distribute ARV drugs. He argued that they shouldn't be so quick to do so because of their adverse effects, and recommended that the members of the council read the information on the Internet on the topic. =2000= March On March 19, 2000, it was reported that Mbeki had consulted biochemist David Rasnick and history professor Charles Geshekter, both of whom are AIDS denialists, for advice on HIV/AIDS. Awa Marie Coll-Seck reacted to the news by saying, \\"At first, we were thinking we would just ignore it, but now we think this confusion can really undermine all the efforts people have made to prevent this disease.\\" April On April 20, 2000, Mbeki sent a five-page letter to Bill Clinton in which he describes AIDS as a \\"uniquely African catastrophe\\", and compared the \\"persecution\\" of HIV/AIDS denialists to the treatment of black people in South Africa during the apartheid era. The letter was leaked to The Washington Post shortly afterward, which provoked condemnation from many commentators and \\"infuriated and embarrassed\\" Mbeki. The following day, Jacob Zuma, then South African deputy president, compared those criticizing HIV/AIDS denialists to critics of Galileo during the 17th century. \\"His views were considered to be so threatening to the scientific establishment that he was forced to publicly recant\\", Zuma was quoted as saying in a statement released by the office of the presidency. May Later that year, Mbeki convened a panel of 33 scientists whom he referred to as \\"experts\\", of whom about half were AIDS denialists such as Peter Duesberg and Harvey Bialy. The panel, known as the \\"Presidential Advisory Panel on AIDS\\", also included AIDS researchers who supported the scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS, and was split about evenly between the two groups. Their first meeting was held from May 6 to May 7. Nicoli Nattrass has blamed Duesberg and his supporters on this panel, as well as Mbeki, for the popularity of AIDS denialism in South Africa. July The Presidential Advisory Panel on AIDS's second meeting took place on July 3 and 4 in Johannesburg. Both meetings were closed to the general public and to nearly all journalists, with the exception of Mark Schoofs of the Village Voice. Schoofs reported that David Rasnick, another AIDS denialist member of the panel, had called for HIV testing to be completely banned, and had argued he hadn't seen \\"any evidence\\" of an AIDS catastrophe. The meeting also culminated in research proposals by both supporters and denialists of the HIV/AIDS hypothesis. South African health official Khotso Mokhele praised both proposals, saying that once concluded, one side of the HIV/AIDS debate might \\"shut up once and for all.\\" The AIDS denialists at the meeting recommended that the disease be treated not with antiretroviral drugs, but rather with vitamins and \\"alternative\\" and \\"complementary\\" therapies including \\"massage therapy, music therapy, yoga, spiritual care, homeopathy, Indian ayurvedic medicine, light therapy and many other methods.\\" On July 6, the scientific community responded with the Durban Declaration, signed by 5,000 scientists and published in Nature. The declaration stated, among other things, that \\"HIV causes AIDS. It is unfortunate that a few vocal people continue to deny the evidence. This position will cost countless lives.\\" Nevertheless, when the International AIDS Conference in Durban was held just three days later, where Mbeki was scheduled to give the opening speech, he openly rejected the mainstream view that HIV is the cause of AIDS, and instead argued that it was caused by poverty, bad nourishment and general ill-health. The solution was not, Mbeki continued, expensive western medicine, but the alleviation of poverty in Africa. He also invited Maggiore, an outspoken AIDS denialist, to give a talk at the conference, and, in one of his own speeches, exhorted the other delegates at the conference to \\"...speak to one another honestly and frankly, with sufficient tolerance to respect everybody's point of view, with sufficient tolerance to allow all voices to be heard.\\" His speech met with largely negative reception from the delegates attending the conference, hundreds of whom walked out. September In September 2000, Mbeki told the South African Parliament that \\"The programme of the government in this country is based on this thesis that HIV causes Aids and everything in the programme says that.\\" However, he later stated that he still did not think HIV caused AIDS, and that it could, in his view, only be a contributing factor, not a sole cause. October In mid-October, the South African government announced that Mbeki would be \\"reducing his role\\" in the HIV/AIDS debate, with Mbeki himself acknowledging he may have caused \\"confusion\\" by publicly challenging the mainstream view of the cause of AIDS. Nevertheless, his approval rating had already dropped from 70 to 50 percent in the previous year. Many senior American politicians had expressed private doubts about his judgment, though other South African politicians were even more outspoken in their criticism. For example, many South African trade and banking officials expressed concern that Mbeki's statements were driving away potential investors. In a 2007 interview, Mbeki told his biographer, Mark Gevisser, that he only did this because he was pressured to by his cabinet and he regrets his decision to do so. =2001= August In August 2001, Mbeki incorrectly claimed, based on outdated statistics, that HIV/AIDS is only the 12th leading killer in South Africa, when it was actually the leading killer. He also asked health officials to reassess the budget accordingly, and proposed that the new healthcare budget include a decreased emphasis on HIV/AIDS. October The following October, Mbeki gave two speeches in which he demonstrated that, according to the New York Times, he \\"...remains badly misinformed about [HIV]...\\" In the speeches, he exaggerated the dangers of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), downplayed the dangers of AIDS itself, and suggested that his critics were racist. The Economist reacted to his speech to Parliament, in which he claimed that ARVs \\"...are becoming as dangerous to health as the thing they are supposed to treat\\", by saying that this claim was simply wrong, adding that ARVs not only prolong life but also make sufferers less infectious. They also criticized the government's dismissal of its critics as stooges for international drug companies by arguing that \\"government intransigence, not the cost of drugs, is the real problem.\\" =2003= On September 26, 2003, Mbeki's spokesman confirmed that Mbeki had in fact stated that he didn't know anyone with AIDS. This remark provoked considerable criticism from AIDS activists and opposition politicians, with Xolani Kunene of Treatment Action Campaign remarking that Mbeki was \\"not living in the real South Africa.\\" =2004= Mbeki was asked by the South African Parliament if he thought rape played any role in spreading AIDS, to which he replied that \\"The disease of racism\\" led to blacks being portrayed as \\"lazy, liars, foul-smelling, diseased, corrupt, violent, amoral, sexually depraved, animalistic, savage and rapist.\\" In an opinion piece written four years later, Roger Cohen cited this remark as evidence that Mbeki considered HIV/AIDS to be \\"a fabrication foisted on Africans by whites determined to distract the continent from real problems of racism and poverty, and accepted by blacks afflicted with the slave mentality engendered by apartheid.\\" April The ARVs that had been approved by the government of South Africa five months earlier first began reaching hospitals in April 2004. Some AIDS activists considered this timing suspicious, as it was two weeks before the national elections were to take place that year. =2005= Matthias Rath travels to South Africa to sell his vitamins which, he claims, are effective at curing AIDS. He soon began organizing clinical trials of the efficacy of these vitamins, which led to the Treatment Action Campaign suing him later that year. Nevertheless, Tshabalala- Msimang stood by Rath, and even appeared at a forum in April to defend Rath's \\"right to free speech\\" and claim that his drugs had \\"equal validity\\" to ARVs. Only after a long-running legal battle with the Medicines Control Council were these trials finally declared illegal. AIDS activists have linked Rath's distribution of these vitamins to the deaths of some HIV/AIDS patients. =2006= October On October 26, 2006, South Africa's government announced that they were reversing their previous policies on treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, and would now be distributing ARV drugs through the country's public health services. The announcement was made at a conference of AIDS activists, whom the government had previously ignored. These activists had been spending the previous few years in a legal battle with the country's government in an effort to get them to distribute ARV drugs. December In late 2006, Tshabalala-Msimang fell ill, after which the country's deputy health minister, Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, assumed leadership over South Africa's health policies after being summoned to do so by deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. While she was at the helm of South Africa's health policies from then until she was fired next August, she attempted to reverse Mbeki's AIDS denialist policies by describing the number of South Africans waiting for ARV drugs as a \\"serious violation of human rights.\\" She was also one of the principal authors of the country's aggressively anti-AIDS health plan, which was adopted that December. =2007= On August 9, 2007, despite ongoing calls to fire Tshabalala-Msimang, Mbeki instead fired Madlala- Routledge, South Africa's then-deputy health minister and a longtime critic of his AIDS policies. The stated reason was that she had attended an AIDS conference without his permission, but critics argued this was merely an excuse for Mbeki to rid himself of a politician who was willing to criticize his policies. Given that few other South African officials were willing to criticize Mbeki's views on AIDS, the Economist expressed concern that her absence would lead to a reversal of the superior AIDS policies she had helped implement. On August 31, 2007, after Tshabalala-Msimang came under attack for denying that HIV caused AIDS and promoting unorthodox treatments for the disease, Mbeki leapt to her defense, writing in ANC Today that she would go down in history as \\"...one of the pioneer architects of a South African public health system constructed to ensure that we achieve the objective of health for all our people, and especially the poor.\\" He also referred to her as a hero and to her critics as \\"wild animals.\\" =2008= On February 7, 2008, research by Nicoli Nattrass estimated that the failure of Mbeki's administration to provide ARV drugs until 2006 was responsible for about 343,000 deaths. Later that year, a study by Pride Chigwedere et al., published in the December 2008 issue of the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, estimated that Mbeki's HIV/AIDS policies were responsible for \\"more than 330,000\\" deaths. On September 25, 2008, Kgalema Motlanthe succeeded Mbeki as president of South Africa. On the first day of his presidency, he removed Tshabalala-Msimang from the office of health minister and replaced her with Barbara Hogan. Hogan's views on AIDS reflected a dramatic shift from her predecessor's--in December 2008, she promised to increase the supply of ARV drugs available to pregnant women in South Africa, as well as to improve HIV prevention programs. =2009= July On July 19, 2009, a paper co- authored by Duesberg and several other denialists was published, as an Epub ahead of print, in the non-peer reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses (though it had originally been submitted to the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes). The paper, which was mainly a response to Chigwedere's 2008 study, argued that official statistics showed that Chigwedere et al.'s estimates of deaths due to AIDS in South Africa (about 330,000 per year) were wildly overestimated and that there was \\"as yet no proof that HIV causes AIDS.\\" Eventually, the journal received numerous expressions of concern about the paper, including accusations of libel and concern about its potential adverse impact on public health, and therefore retracted it that September. This led to Elsevier, the journal's publisher, threatening to fire Bruce Charlton, the journal's editor, if he did not institute a peer-review process for the journal. Charlton refused, and was therefore fired in May 2010. October On October 29, 2009, South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, who had been elected president the previous May, gave a speech which was seen by many as the end of AIDS denialism in South Africa. In the speech, Zuma acknowledged HIV/AIDS as one of South Africa's most serious problems, saying that \\"...all South Africans need to know their HIV status, and be informed of the treatment options available to them.\\" Criticism During Mbeki's presidency, many medical researchers harshly criticized his AIDS policies and predicted that these policies would lead to countless deaths. Another critic of these policies was Harvard University's Robert Rotberg, who, in 2000, said of Mbeki's AIDS policies, \\"This is very foolish and uncharacteristic of him.\\" In 2002, Mbeki's AIDS policies faced even more criticism, this time from Nelson Mandela, who said in an interview that \\"This [AIDS] is a war. It has killed more people than has been the case in all previous wars and in all previous natural disasters. We must not continue to be debating, to be arguing, when people are dying.\\" The Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, also criticized these policies, saying that the government was \\"sinning\\" by \\"withholding truth and maintaining the silence of denial\\" over AIDS. Desmond Tutu also spoke out against Mbeki's AIDS denialist policies and compared them to \\"fiddling while Rome burns\\". Ndungane, along with Max Essex, have argued that Mbeki's policies were worse than just bad judgment—Ndungane even described these policies as a crime against humanity on the same scale as apartheid.Did Thabo Mbeki Commit A Crime?, Forbes After Chigwedere et al.'s research estimating AIDS denialist policies in South Africa led to over 300,000 deaths was published, philosopher Peter Singer cited it in support of his conclusion that \\"Mbeki, like Mandela, was active in the struggle against apartheid. Yet the Harvard study shows that he is responsible for the deaths of 5,000 times as many black South Africans as the white South African police who fired on the crowd at Sharpeville.\\" Singer also wrote that while Mbeki was not motivated by malice in deciding his AIDS policies, that he was nevertheless \\"culpable, not for having initially entertained a view held by a tiny minority of scientists, but for having clung to this view without allowing it to be tested in fair and open debate among experts.\\" Other critics, such as Karl Kruszelnicki, have noted that South Africa, unlike many of its fellow sub-Saharan African countries, \\"...has both the medical personnel and wealth to meet the HIV/AIDS challenge head-on\\", making it especially unfortunate that these resources were not used for so long. Public popularity of AIDS denialism in South Africa In 2006, 40% of South Africans believed there was a cure for AIDS. Research presented by Nicoli Nattrass at a Harvard symposium on October 19, 2009 concluded that \\"...denialist beliefs are held disproportionately by black African men and are far more likely to be held by those supportive of Mbeki's health minister [Tshabalala-Msimang].\\" References Category:HIV/AIDS in South Africa Category:HIV/AIDS denialism ","title":"HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa"},{"id":"42282016","text":"Donald Macleod (born 24 November 1940 in Ness, LewisJohn Macleod, \\"Logic on fire: the life and career of Donald Macleod\\" in The People's Theologian: Writings in Honour of Donald Macleod (Mentor, 2011), p. 16.) is a Scottish theologian.

Lee is best known for directing period dramas, notably 500 Years of Joseon (1983-1990), Hur Jun (1999) and Dae Jang Geum (2003). Career Lee Byung-hoon began working for broadcasting network MBC in 1970, and made his solo directorial debut in 1974. In 1983, he and writer Shin Bong-seung created the landmark eight-year-long series 500 Years of Joseon, which shifted the genre of historical/period dramas (called sageuk in Korean) from monotonous historical chronicles into the interpretation of bonafide records like the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. His follow-up, Kim Jung-soo-penned contemporary drama My Mother's Sea (1993) was also popular, with a peak viewership rating of 51.6%. But in 1999 Lee revolutionized the sageuk genre with Hur Jun, the first Korean period drama to focus on a \\"commoner\\" historical figure instead of royalty and powerful nobles. Jun Kwang-ryul played Heo Jun, a court physician who wrote Dongui Bogam, one of the pillars of traditional Korean medicine. Hur Jun reached record-breaking viewership ratings of 64% (fourth highest rated Korean drama of all time). This was followed by Sangdo in 2001, an adaptation of the Choi In-ho novel about legendary merchant Im Sang-ok, and Lee again cast Jun in the leading role. Journalists coined the term \\"fusion sageuk\\" for Lee's attempts to revitalize the genre, transforming the previous lack of accessibility and narrative cliches of period dramas with its viewership of older, male armchair historians, into something more appealing to an increasingly younger demographic of viewers. Sageuk further rose to prominence in 2003 with Dae Jang Geum (also known as Jewel in the Palace), whose protagonist Jang Geum first trains in Korean royal court cuisine before becoming Joseon's first female court physician. Domestically, Dae Jang Geum was a big hit, receiving a peak viewership rating of 57.8% (tenth highest rated Korean drama of all time). Produced for , it was later exported to 91 countries and became one of the major proponents of the Korean Wave, earning worldwide, and turning actress Lee Young-ae into a superstar in China and an icon for Korean culture. Lee continued directing hit period dramas in succeeding years. Ballad of Seodong (2005) is about King Mu of Baekje who falls for Princess Seonhwa of the rival kingdom Silla (played by Jo Hyun-jae and Lee Bo-young). Yi San (2007) revolved around the love story of King Jeongjo and his concubine Ui-bin Seong (played by Lee Seo-jin and Han Ji-min). Dong Yi (2010) is about Suk-bin Choe (played by Han Hyo-joo) who rises from being a palace water maid (musuri) to the concubine of King Sukjong. The King's Doctor (2012) marked theater/film actor Cho Seung-woo's first TV series, in the role of a horse veterinarian who becomes a court physician. Lee has worked with writer Choi Wan-kyu on Hur Jun and Sangdo, writer Kim Yi-young on Yi San, Dong Yi and The King's Doctor, and writer Kim Young-hyun on Dae Jang Geum and Ballad of Seodong. In 2016, Lee collaborated with screenwriter for the 3rd time with MBC's 55th-founding anniversary drama, The Flower in Prison. The drama, about a girl who was born in prison and later becomes an advocate for the poor and unfairly accused people, cast Jin Se-yeon in lead role. The 22-years-old actress has become Lee's youngest female protagonist to date.

As a young political activist in 1916 she met the now famous feminist Margaret Sanger and her sister Ethel Byrne. Together, the three women opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in Brooklyn known as the \\"Brownsville Clinic\\" (after the Brownsville section of Brooklyn in which it was located). The clinic caused an immediate sensation in the press, getting national attention, and all three women were arrested and tried for \\"distributing obscene materials\\". \\"The police monitored the Clinic from its opening and sent in a female undercover agent to purchase contraceptive supplies. On October 26 (1916) an undercover police woman and vice-squad officers raided the clinic, confiscated an assortment of contraceptives from pessaries to condoms, along with 20 'books on young women', and arrested Sanger, Byrne and Mindell. After being arraigned, Sanger and Mindell spent the night in the Raymond Street jail, Byrne at the Liberty Avenue station. All were released the next morning on $500.00 bail.\\" Margaret Sanger Papers Project, NYU. All three women were found guilty, but eventually the verdicts were overturned, and their campaign was ultimately successful, leading to major changes in social policy and to the laws governing birth control and sex education around the world.“Mrs Sanger Gets 30 Days.” Washington Post, February 7, 1917.\\"Mrs. Sanger's Aide Is Found Guilty\\". New York Times, January 9, 1917. The clinic closed but later became the basis for what was to become known as Planned Parenthood.

The couple traveled extensively- in Europe, the Caribbean, and Haiti in the 1930s- but seem to have fallen in love with Mexico by the 1940s.

She wrote the hit Korean dramas Queen of Housewives (2009), My Husband Got a Family (2012), My Love from the Star (2013–2014), The Producers (2015), Legend of the Blue Sea (2016) and Crash Landing on You (2019–2020). Career =Early works= Park Ji-eun began her entertainment career in 1997, and spent the next decade writing for talk radio shows, variety shows and sitcoms. In 2007, she wrote Love Isn't Stop, a TV movie with an omnibus format, which aired on cable channel KBS N. This led to her first drama miniseries Get Karl! Oh Soo- jung, which she co-wrote with Park Hye-ryun. Starring Uhm Jung-hwa and Oh Ji- ho, it was based on the real-life love story of Lee Ju-young, the CEO of a TV production company who reunited with her husband, pro-golfer Go Man-soo, ten years after breaking up with him. =Queen of Housewives= For Park's first solo writing credit, she wrote Queen of Housewives (also known as My Wife Is a Superwoman) which aired in 2009. The comedy-drama series depicted naejo in a modern setting, traditional Korean housewives who devote their entire lives to their husbands' success. It revolved around three couples entangled in love and rivalry as they work for the Queens Food corporation, played by Kim Nam- joo, Oh Ji-ho, Lee Hye-young, Choi Cheol-ho, Yoon Sang-hyun and Sunwoo Sun. The drama was notable for being Kim Nam-joo's comeback after an eight-year hiatus from acting, in the role of a former prom queen-turned-dowdy housewife struggling to help her socially inept husband rise up the corporate ranks, while contending with a clique of wives led by a frenemy who is now the wife of her husband's boss. Queen of Housewives topped the ratings chart during its run (with a peak of 31.7%), started new fashion and makeup trends among married women (or ajummas), and also served as Yoon Sang-hyun's breakout vehicle. Park won Writer of the Year at the MBC Drama Awards. =Queen of Reversals= A year later, Park wrote Queen of Reversals, again casting Kim Nam-joo as the protagonist. Kim pointed to Park's ability to write realistic lines as one of the biggest reasons why she decided to sign on, while Park said that couples who straddle married life and the workplace would be able to easily relate to her drama. Despite similar themes, Reversals is not a sequel or spin-off of Housewives, with a completely new cast (except for Kim) and characters. While her previous drama depicted the lives of Korean housewives and their under-appreciated efforts, Park's next series explored the hardships of working women who must also juggle being wives and mothers as soon as they get home. Kim played a strong-willed, ruthless career woman who quits work after getting married, but a happy domestic life eludes her as her husband (Jung Joon-ho) struggles professionally. When he gets fired, she re-enters the workplace and takes problems into her own hands as the family's breadwinner, eventually catching the eye of her boss (Park Si-hoo). Queen of Reversals was not as successful in the ratings as its predecessor, staying within the mid-10% range. =My Husband Got a Family= In Park's third collaboration with Kim Nam-joo, they had an even bigger hit with My Husband Got a Family (also known as You Who Rolled in Unexpectedly and Unexpected You). During its more than five-month run, it topped the weekly ratings chart for 25 consecutive weeks and received average ratings of 33.1% and a peak of 52.3%. The series ranked number one overall on the 2012 yearly TV ratings chart. The plot centered on a successful TV director (Kim) who marries an orphaned doctor (Yoo Jun-sang), but her husband finds his biological parents and they happen to be her next-door neighbors with whom she bickers on a daily basis; she now faces the unexpected burden of having to build a relationship with her new- found in-laws and their sprawling extended family. Producer Kim Sung-geun attributed its success to the increasing popularity of TV dramas that portray the lives of working women in their 30s and 40s, a genre in which Park is one of the most high-profile Korean screenwriters. Kim Nam-joo described Park as being \\"able to take a double-edged approach to her subject matter. The tone is both comical and serious, without getting too skewed to one side.\\" Though this was her first weekend family drama, Park was praised for being well-versed in dialogue that resonated with modern-day women, and developing multiple characters in the 19-member ensemble cast. She won recognition for her writing from several organizations, including the Korea Drama Awards, the K-Drama Star Awards, and the KBS Drama Awards. =My Love from the Star= In 2013, Park explored the fantasy/romantic comedy genre with My Love from the Star (also known as You Who Came from the Stars). She cast Jun Ji-hyun (in her first TV drama in 14 years) and Kim Soo-hyun in a tale about an alien who landed on Earth in the Joseon Dynasty, disguising his identity for over four centuries and becoming cynical about human beings, until he falls in love with a top actress in the modern era. Not only was the series a hit with a peak viewership rating of 28.1%, it also influenced Korean fashion, with clothes, accessories and make-up products worn by Jun seeing an \\"unprecedented\\" surge in sales. It also became massively popular in China, where it became the most expensive Korean drama sold as of February 2014, was viewed more than 2.5 billion times online on Chinese platform iqiyi, and sparked a craze for the snack chimaek (Korean fried chicken and beer). In an op-ed piece published by the China Daily, writer Xiao Lixin attributed its success to \\"great innovations in South Korean TV productions in terms of themes and narrative patterns,\\" praising the plot as \\"logical and fast-paced\\" interspersed with \\"whimsy and romantic punch lines.\\" The Washington Post reported in March 2014 that My Love from the Star was discussed at China's National People's Congress, particularly in a committee of political advisory body Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where it reportedly topped the agenda among delegates from the culture and entertainment industry. But Park also became embroiled in a plagiarism suit when author Kang Kyung-ok alleged that the series' concept and characters shared too many similarities with her 2008 comic book Seol-hee. Park has denied the claims, posting on the website of production company HB Entertainment a detailed account of how she came up with the idea many years ago, and swore that she \\"had never heard of or read Seol-hee.\\" =The Producers= Park returned to her variety roots in 2015 with The Producers, using an experimental format that combined scripted and reality television. She collaborated with a crew largely composed of variety regulars led by Seo Soo-min, chief producer of the Happy Sunday programming block. The series reunited Park with My Love from the Star leading man Kim Soo-hyun, who starred alongside Cha Tae-hyun, Gong Hyo-jin and IU in a story set in real- life network KBS and focuses on fictional employees of its variety department. The Producers was the first ever Korean network drama to air in the Friday- Saturday time slot, which was usually reserved for late-night comedy shows; network dramas had previously been strictly divided into weekday and weekend programs. =Legend of the Blue Sea= Park's subsequent project reunited her with My Love from the Star lead actress Jun Ji-hyun. Lee Min-ho starred as the lead actor. Titled Legend of the Blue Sea, the drama is based on a Joseon-era legend. The drama aired at the end of 2016 on SBS. The television series centers on the love story of Heo Joon-jae, the son of a rich businessman who becomes a clever con-artist after his parents' divorce, and a mermaid named Shim Cheong. Focusing on rebirth, fate, and unrequited love, their tale is juxtaposed with the parallel story of their Joseon era incarnations, town head Kim Dam-ryeong and the mermaid Se-hwa. The show started with a strong 16.4% viewership rating nationwide, reaching as high as 20.7 percent for certain scenes, according to Nielsen Korea and surpassed the 20% mark in the metropolitan area by its sixth episode. The series maintained the first-place ranking for its timeslot and surpassed 20% viewership ratings. The series also fared well overseas, having been exported to all major regions around the world, including Southeast Asia, the Americas and Europe. =Crash Landing on You= Park made her return to writing dramas in 2019 with Crash Landing on You, starring popular actors, Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin as the main leads. It tells the story of two star crossed lovers, a South Korean heiress and a North Korean elite who also happens to be an army officer. One day, while paragliding, Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) has an accident caused by strong winds, leading her to crash land in North Korea, where she meets Ri Jeong-hyuk (Hyun Bin), a North Korean army officer, who agrees to help her return to South Korea. Over time, they fall in love, despite the divide and dispute between their respective countries. It is the highest rated tvN drama and the third- highest-rated Korean drama in cable television history. The drama got high praise for its originality and the way the plot was played out. It was also immensely popular among fans all over Asia. It consistently remained in the Top Ten on Netflix in almost all major Asian markets and accumulated 1.75 billion online views globally.

Course The headwaters of the stream originate in Thompsons Corner area of the county, about northwest of Clarksburg, and the creek flows south for about , to Little Seneca Lake, a reservoir built on Little Seneca Creek. Little Seneca Creek drains to the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. Water quality and land use issue The Tenmile Creek watershed is described as one of the highest quality stream systems in Montgomery County, according to government studies. It is a drinking water source as part of the Little Seneca system, an emergency water supply for the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. The creek main stem is extensively forested and the watershed contains some agricultural land. However, the basin is bisected by an interstate highway, I-270, and in the late 1980s the county began planning for additional land development in the Clarksburg area. In 1994 the county government had designated a portion of the watershed as a \\"special protection area\\" (SPA) to protect water quality by requiring builders to install extensive controls for stormwater runoff. A follow-up study found that after construction of several projects, water quality in the Little Seneca basin was degraded, despite the SPA requirements. In April 2014, the Montgomery County Council set additional limits on development projects in order to protect the quality of the creek and adjacent habitat. Resolution No. 17-1048. Later that year, developers filed suit against the county, claiming that the county \\"illegally limited construction on its property.\\" The U.S. District Court in Maryland dismissed the suit in August 2017.

The property was established in the mid-1960s when three blocks east of Rawlinna Station became available. Over 32 applicants wanted to settle the blocks that later became known as Balgair, Kybo and Desert Downs. When running sheep it has been stocked with up to 10,000 head and has a maximum carrying capacity of 17,500. It has good quality underground water with seven equipped bores and a further four unequipped bores on undeveloped areas. The property has a homestead, a four-stand shearing shed and drafting yards. The station was recently listed for sale at 2.1 million. Since at least 2001 Balgair was owned and managed by Mark and Karen Forrester, who also operate Kanandah Station. Both properties produce certified organic beef. The area suffered from drought from 2002 to 2009, with cattle from Balgair being trucked from the property and agisted further west.

It originates in the Canelo Hills and continues northwest about to an area just outside Tucson, where it becomes known as Pantano Wash. Pantano Wash continues through Tucson and eventually connects with the Rillito River. Course From its origin in the Canelo Hills of Santa Cruz County at , Ciénega Creek flows northwesterly through the upper Ciénega basin, a wide alluvial valley separating the northern Santa Rita and Empire Mountains to the west and the Whetstone Mountains to the east. A bedrock high, called \\"the Narrows,\\" serves as a hydrologic barrier dividing the upper and lower basins, and is characterized by riparian vegetation and perennial flow. Ciénega Creek continues northward through the lower alluvial basin until it bends west/northwest in the vicinity of Anderson and Wakefield Canyons. After crossing Interstate 10 near the town of Vail, Ciénega Creek again crosses a bedrock high, and once more the flow becomes perennial. In these stretches, groundwater is forced upward through faults in the bedrock from aquifers near the surface. Just north of Vail, Ciénega Creek becomes known as Pantano Wash, which continues northwest through Tucson and links up with the Rillito River. Flora and fauna Ciénega Creek is located within the transitional zone between the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, and exhibits some features of each region. The creek supports \\"outstanding examples\\" of cottonwood-willow gallery forest and mesquite bosque, which are home to many bird species that have become rare due to the loss of riparian habitats. Some of the birds that live along the creek are the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Yellow-billed cuckoo, and Bell's vireo. Important lowland populations of riparian and xeroriparian amphibians and reptiles are also known to live along the creek. Included in this group are several toads, the checkered garter snake, the Madrean alligator lizard, and the giant spotted whiptail lizard. The Mexican garter snake, which has declined throughout its range in the United States, retains a strong population in Ciénega Creek. The federally endangered Chiricahua leopard frog occurs only in the upper reaches of the creek. The lowland leopard frog and the Sonoran mud turtle inhabit the stream throughout, rounding a full complement of aquatic, native vertebrate species originally inhabiting the ciénegas of southern Arizona. An unstudied molluscan fauna also lives in the stream. Ciénega Creek is one of the few remaining streams in southern Arizona that has not been invaded by non-native fish. Las Cienegas National Conservation Area supports the largest natural population of the federally endangered Gila topminnow in the United States, as well as a healthy population of endangered Gila chub and the longfin dace. Conservation Las Cienegas National Conservation Area was established in 2000 to protect the upper Ciénega basin. Its headquarters is the historic Empire Ranch, which is located about southeast of Tucson, near the town of Sonoita. Spanning , Las Cienegas includes large areas of grassland and woodland, in addition to Ciénega Creek and the riparian corridor. Empire Ranch, which dates back to the 1870s, is also open to the public, and has been listed on the National Historic Register since 1976. The Ciénega Creek Natural Preserve was founded in 1986 and is about north of Empire Ranch, in the lower Ciénega basin. With in total, the Ciénega Creek Natural Preserve protects over of the creek, about half of which has perennial flow. There are also a few historic sites located in the preserve, including the ghost town of Pantano and the Ciénega Bridge, which was built between 1920 and 1921. In Tucson, much of the Pantano Wash is now part of the Pantano River Park, which includes a paved walkway alongside the wash, as well as restrooms, water fountains, and picnic tables. The Pantano River Park is also home to a Commemorative Tree Park, which will help restore about two miles of riverbank, control floods, erosion and stormwater runoff reduction, carbon sequestration, urban heat, and provide shade. Since 2012, over 100 desert-adapted commemorative trees have been planted along the eastern banks of Pantano Wash. Hundreds more will be added over the following years, until the goal of 570 trees is reached.

As of March 2020, there were 293 registered distilleries in operation within Australia, of which approximately 50 have a whisky on the market. The Industry has shown steady growth since the early 90s especially in the boutique craft distilling scene. Most Australian whisky is produced using a very similar process to that of Scottish whisky, however the flavour of Australian whisky is subtly different. Although the majority of whisky produced in Australia is in the Single Malt style there is more variation than what is found overseas, with no strict customs or traditions governing the styles produced. Multiple styles of whisky are produced in Australia, including single malt, rye, wheat and blended whiskies. Australian whisky was popularised globally in 2014, when Sullivan’s Cove French Oak single cask won the world’s best single malt whisky at the World Whiskies Awards. This was the first time a distillery outside of Scotland or Japan had won this category.  History  Whilst Australia has a long history of whisky distilling, dating back to 1820, the whisky industry looks very different in the 21st century to when it begun. Distillation was legalised by the Australian government at the end of 1820, and by 1822 the first legal distillery was opened in Tasmania. Prior to 1990, over 85% of whisky production came out of Victoria. While Tasmania had a small whisky industry in the early 1820s this ended quickly and there was no whisky produced in Tasmania between 1838 and 1990. Sydney also had two large distilleries in operation between 1825, and 1850 when their focus shifted to making rum instead. It is estimated that a total of 140 million litres of whisky was produced in Australia between 1822, and 1979, however, no whisky was produced in Australia between 1980 and 1990. The Whisky industry in Australia can be broken down into three distinct periods: The colonial malt whisky period (1863–1929), The blended whisky period (1930–1980) and finally the boutique whisky period, since 1992. = The colonial malt whisky period (Victoria 1863–1929) = Following the Victorian Distillation Act of 1862, the first large scale whisky distillation in the country began in 1863, with the opening of John Dunn’s Warrenheip distillery outside Ballarat; Warrenheip distillery was Australia’s second largest distillery until 1930. In 1888 the Federal distillery was constructed in Port Melbourne and was the third largest distillery in the world at the time. By 1894, Federal Distillery produced in excess of 1.1 million litres of spirit per year, however not all of this was whisky, as the distillery also produced brandy and gin. = Blended whisky period (Victoria 1930–1980) = The second major period in Australian whisky history began when large British distilling companies started opening distilleries within Australia, using imported materials from Britain. In 1930, the Distillers Company of Edinburgh (now known as Diageo), opened Corio distillery outside Geelong; Corio Distillery replaced Warrenheip as the largest producer of whisky in Australia. Soon after opening, Corio Distillery merged with Federal Distilleries company. Following the end of World war II, Gilbey’s of London, the second largest distiller in the world at the time, opened a distillery in Melbourne, simultaneously acquiring the Milne Distillery in Adelaide. This meant that almost all whisky distillation in Australia was controlled by the two international distilling companies Gilbey’s of London, and the Distillers Company of Edinburgh. At the time protectionist laws gave both companies a 40% price advantage over imported Scotch whisky. Based on this, both companies made the commercial decision to produce lower quality whisky in Australia, in order to control the cheap whisky market within the country. This resulted in a poor quality and reputation for the whisky produced in Australia during that period. In 1960, the protectionist tariffs on imported whisky were removed, meaning that imported whisky was much more affordable. This led to a significant drop in demand for the lower quality whisky being produced in Australia domestically as the price of the superior imported whisky dropped. As a result of this by 1980, both major Australian whisky distilleries had shut down and been sold. = The boutique whisky period (Since 1992) = In the early 1990s several small craft distilleries began to open beginning with Lark distillery in 1992, and followed by other small distilleries in Tasmania and Victoria. Prior to 1990, distillation in Australia was only accessible to large commercial companies, this was due to the Distillation Act of 1901, which prevented licenses from being issued for distilleries whose primary wash still was smaller than 2,700 litres. By comparison, in 2020 one of the largest independent distilleries in Australia, only used an 1,800 litre Wash still. In 1990 Bill lark, who is the founder of Lark whisky, lobbied the government to have this restriction amended, and he is largely credited as being responsible for overturning this law. Since 1990, the Whisky industry in Australia has seen significant growth, as of 2020 there are over 293 Distilleries in operation within Australia, of which an estimated 50 have whisky products on the market, with more in the process of creating their first whisky.  Modern distilleries by state  As of 2020, there were approximately 50 active distilleries producing whisky in Australia. Whilst Tasmania hosts the largest concentration of whisky distilleries in Australia, there are also many whisky distilleries scattered throughout Australia. = Tasmania = Tasmania has the most distilleries of any state in Australia by far, with over 22 whisky distilleries in 2020. This is due to conditions in Tasmania being very suitable for whisky production. The climate has a large diurnal temperature range, and seasonal variation, which is desirable for whisky maturation. In addition, distilleries in Tasmania claim to use some of the best quality water in the world. Map of Tasmania, Australia showing locations of whisky distilleries. Notable Distilleries: * Lark distillery: Often referred to as the grandfather of craft whisky in Australia, Bill lark begun distilling in 1992 at home, and shortly after opened the first whisky distillery in Tasmania since the 1830s. In 2015, Bill Lark was inducted into the Whisky Hall of fame, and at the time was only the seventh person outside Scotland or Ireland to be given the honour. * Sullivans cove distillery: The second-longest running modern whisky distillery in Australia, Sullivan’s Cove was established in 1994, however changed ownership in 1999. Under the new owners Sullivan’s Cove has won many awards for their whisky, most notably the world’s best single malt in 2014. * Hellyers road distillery: Founded in 1999 by a boutique milk co-operative ‘Betta Milk’, Hellyers road distillery exports to over 20 countries in 2020. = New South Wales = After Tasmania, NSW has the second most whisky distilleries in Australia, with 9 whisky distilleries in 2020, and has a large number of urban distilleries located in the Sydney area. Notable Distilleries: * Archie Rose Distillery: Founded in 2014, Archie rose was the first new distillery to open in Sydney since 1853, and initially were known for their gin and vodka. In 2018, Archie rose began releasing rye malt whisky, and was awarded the world's best rye whisky in 2020. * Manly Spirits: Founded in 2017, manly spirits primarily produces gin and vodka, however begun production of whisky to be released in 2020. = Victoria = Victoria has 7 active whisky distilleries, much like Sydney many of these are located in the city of Melbourne. Starward's wine cask whisky Notable Distilleries: * Starward: Established in 2004, Starward was founded under the name New World Whisky distillery in an old Qantas Airlines hangar. Starward distillery is known for its wine cask whisky, matured exclusively in wine barrels sourced from the Barossa valley region. * Bakery Hill Distillery: Founded in 1999 by biochemist David Baker, Bakery hill distillery is one of the few Australian whiskies that is made in the peated style. The distillery has received many international awards for its whisky. = Western Australia = There are four whisky distilleries in Western Australia as of 2020. Though a small fledgling industry, Western Australia whiskies have won international awards, in particular Limeburners whisky distillery won best international whisky in 2017. = South Australia = Many of the distilleries in South Australia are near or within wine growing regions and take advantage of the tourism and wine barrels this provides. Many of the distilleries producing whisky in South Australia started out producing craft gin, and many begun producing whisky in 2019 and 2020. = Queensland = The climate in Queensland is not ideal for whisky maturation, and most distilleries in Queensland are dedicated to rum production. There are currently three small distilleries in Queensland producing whisky: Mt Uncle Distillery, Wild River Distillery and 2020 Distillery.  Critical reception and awards  Sullivans Cove's 2014 Single Cask French oak. Awarded world's best single malt whisky at the world whiskies awards 2014. Until the early 1990s, Australian whisky was poorly regarded both internationally and within Australia, with mass-produced low quality whisky dominating the market. Whisky produced during the mid-1900s had a poor reputation locally, and was considered inferior to imported products. After the emergence of the craft whisky scene in the 1990s, Australian whisky began garnering attention from international critics. In 2013, prolific whisky critic Jim Murray praised the fledgling Australian whisky industry, describing a Sullivans Cove whisky as “a staggering achievement”. This international attention culminated in 2014, when Sullivans Cove distillery won the world's best single malt at the world whiskies awards for its Single Cask French Oak whisky. The award was of particular importance as it marked the first time a distillery outside of Scotland or Japan had won, and helped garner worldwide attention for the relatively small Australian whisky industry, and was an excellent source of international promotion. Australian whiskies continued performing well internationally with multiple distilleries placing highly in worldwide competitions, notably Sullivans Cove continued to be awarded the world's best single cask single malt whisky in 2018 and 2019. In addition to the single malts, in 2020 Archie rose distillery was awarded the world’s best rye whisky, a category formerly dominated by the USA and Canada.  Style and process  Like all whisky, grain is the principle ingredient in Australian whisky production, being required for its sugar content (see distillation). Traditionally in Scotland malted barley is used to distil ‘malt whisky’ whereas ‘grain whisky’ is produced from the cheaper grains such as corn, oats or wheat, and can be produced at a higher volume. Blended whiskies are the created through the process of blending the more neutral grain whisky with the much more flavourful, albeit more expensive malt whisky. Distillation processes for distilling whisky vary across the world; Australia uses the same double pot still method to that widely used to distil single malt whisky in Scotland. Whilst Australian whisky is produced using a very similar method to Scottish whisky, the resulting flavour is slightly different. Unlike the Scotch industry Australia has no deep customs or traditions surrounding its whisky, resulting in an increased variation in styles and flavours of whisky produced within Australia. Whilst the USA stipulates whisky be made using only new unused American oak barrels, Australia (and Scotland) does not have this constraint. Due to this most Australian whisky is matured in ex-bourbon barrels, with most of the remainder matured in ex-port barrels. There are also many distilleries which take advantage of the well-established Australian wine industry, for example, Starward distilleries’ wine cask edition whisky exclusively uses ex-wine casks from the Barossa wine producing region. Many of the whiskies produced in Australia use brewing barley, instead of traditional distilling barley; brewing barley has a slightly different and stronger flavour than distilling barley, this lends a unique flavour to many Australian whiskies.  Economic impacts  Since the late 2000s, many rural areas of Australia have seen growth in tourism related to the whisky industry, and many regions promote Australian whisky trails. As worldwide awareness of Australian whisky grows, many producers are beginning to export larger quantities overseas. As of 2020, the whisky industry in Australia remains relatively small, and Australians consume only an estimated 1% of locally made spirits. Many small distilleries cite the excise tax regime in Australia as an obstacle to growth, with a standard 700ml bottle attracting close to $30AUD in tax depending on alcohol concentration.

This animation shows the Arctic Ocean melt during the summer of 2011. This visual shows the Arctic sea ice change and the corresponding absorbed solar radiation change during June, July, and August from 2000 through 2014. The Arctic ice pack is the sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean and its vicinity. The Arctic ice pack undergoes a regular seasonal cycle in which ice melts in spring and summer, reaches a minimum around mid- September, then increases during fall and winter. Summer ice cover in the Arctic is about 50% of winter cover.Polar Sea Ice Cap and Snow – Cryosphere Today, University of Illinois Some of the ice survives from one year to the next. Currently, 28% of Arctic basin sea ice is multi-year ice,Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis – April 2008 thicker than seasonal ice: up to thick over large areas, with ridges up to thick. As well as the regular seasonal cycle there has been an underlying trend of declining sea ice in the Arctic in recent decades. Climatic importance =Energy balance effects= Sea ice has an important effect on the heat balance of the polar oceans, since it insulates the (relatively) warm ocean from the much colder air above, thus reducing heat loss from the oceans. Sea ice is highly reflective of solar radiation, reflecting about 60% of incoming solar radiation when bare and about 80% when covered with snow. This is due to a feedback known as the albedo effect. This is much greater than the reflectivity of the sea (about 10%) and thus the ice also affects the absorption of sunlight at the surface. =Hydrological effects= The sea ice cycle is also an important source of dense (saline) \\"bottom water\\". When sea water freezes it leaves most of its salt content behind. The remaining surface water, made dense by the extra salinity, sinks and produces dense water masses such as North Atlantic Deep Water. This production of dense water is essential in maintaining the thermohaline circulation, and the accurate representation of these processes is important in climate modelling. = Odden = In the Arctic, a key area where pancake ice forms the dominant ice type over an entire region is the so-called Odden ice tongue in the Greenland Sea. The Odden (the word is Norwegian for the headland) grows eastward from the main East Greenland ice edge in the vicinity of 72–74°N during the winter because of the presence of very cold polar surface water in the Jan Mayen Current, which diverts some water eastward from the East Greenland Current at that latitude. Most of the old ice continues south, driven by the wind, so a cold open water surface is exposed on which new ice forms as frazil and pancake in the rough seas.

Photo from onboard the MS Hanseatic, 2014-08-27: Polar ice limit (Record position 85°40,7818’ N, 135°38,8735‘ E) In this animation, the Earth rotates slowly as the Arctic sea ice advances over time from March 21, 2014 to August 3, 2014. Records of Arctic Sea ice from the United Kingdom's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research go back to the turn of the 20th century, although the quality of the data before 1950 is debatable. Reliable measurements of sea ice edge begin within the satellite era. From the late 1970s, the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on Seasat (1978) and Nimbus 7 (1978–87) satellites provided information that was independent of solar illumination or meteorological conditions. The frequency and accuracy of passive microwave measurements improved with the launch of the DMSP F8 Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI) in 1987. Both the sea ice area and extent are estimated, with the latter being larger, as it is defined as the area of ocean with at least 15% sea ice. A modeling study of the 52-year period from 1947 to 1999 found a statistically significant trend in Arctic ice volume of −3% per decade; splitting this into wind-forced and temperature forced components shows it to be essentially all caused by the temperature forcing. A computer- based, time-resolved calculation of sea ice volume, fitted to various measurements, revealed that monitoring the ice volume is much more significant for evaluating sea ice loss than pure area considerations. The trends from 1979 to 2002 have been a statistically significant Arctic sea ice decrease of −2.5% ± 0.9% per decade during those 23 years.Cavalieri et al. 2003. Climate models simulated this trend in 2002. The September minimum ice extent trend for 1979–2011 declined by 12.0% per decade during 32 years.National Snow and Ice Data Center In 2007 the minimum extent fell by more than a million square kilometers, the biggest decline since accurate satellite data has been available, to . New research shows the Arctic Sea ice to be melting faster than predicted by any of the 18 computer models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in preparing its 2007 assessments. In 2012, a new record low of about was reached. In the overall mass balance, the volume of sea ice depends on the thickness of the ice as well as the areal extent. While the satellite era has enabled better measurement of trends in areal extent, accurate ice thickness measurements remain a challenge. \\"Nonetheless, the extreme loss of this summer’s sea ice cover and the slow onset of freeze-up portends lower than normal ice extent throughout autumn and winter, and the ice that grows back is likely to be fairly thin\\". As more and more of the sea ice is thinner first-year ice the greater effect storms have on its stability with turbulence resulting from major extratropical cyclones resulting in extensive fractures of sea ice.

It was a Roman Catholic school and operated from 1899 to 1958 by the Order of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The students of the school were from the adjacent Mission Reserve as well other Squamish, Tsleil- Waututh and Musqueam children.  History  The Parish of St Paul's was established by Father Leon Fouquet who constructed the St Paul's Indian Church which opened as a chapel in 1866. When Bishop Durieu came to the Church to work with the Squamish people he decided he wanted to provide schooling for them. He led the construction of St Paul's School, located on the Mission Reserve in North Vancouver. In 1898 he wrote to the Motherhouse of the Sisters of the Child Jesus in Lepuy, France. The First three sisters arrived on October 5, 1898, making it the first school for First Nations people on the north shore. The Squamish people supported the school with food and other donations until 1900 when the Department of Indian Affairs took over administration of the school. Indian Affairs' intention was to assimilate the First Nations people by denying them rights to their language, culture and traditions while forcing them to take on the colonialist language, culture, traditions and Roman Catholic Religion. In 1920 the Indian Act was amended and Canadian federal legislation making it mandatory for every Indian child to be sent to residential schools upon reaching 7 years of age until 16 years of age. Most of children came from the surrounding Squamish Nation reserves along Burrard Inlet, Howe Sound, and the Squamish River. Other students were from the Tsleil-Waututh and Musqueam nations, and some came from as far away as the Lil'wat (Mount Currie) band, near Pemberton, as well as the Shishalh (Sechelt) and Sto:lo peoples. Over 2000 students in six generations attended the school, arriving at between 4 and 6 years of age. The students stayed until the eighth grade, or until the age of 16 very few made it to twelfth grade graduation. Children in the school were segregated by age group and gender and were often not permitted to visit other family members in the school. They were stripped of their culture and were punished for taking part in their own language or cultural traditions.  Contemporary Building  The St Paul’s Indian Residential School was torn down in 1959. The site was turned over to the Catholic Arch-Diocese, a Catholic School Board which supervised the building of St Thomas Aquinas Catholic High School on the grounds. First Nations students were allowed to attend this school and came from the Squamish Nation, Mt Currie and Powell River under the direction of the Department of Indian Affairs. The high school still remains on the original site today and some Squamish students still attend each year.  Memorial  On August 13, 2013 the mayor of the City of North Vancouver agreed to construct a monument honoring the survivors from St Paul’s Indian Residential School. The memorial is an art piece in the form of a wave with a high point representing pre- European contact, a low point in the wave representing the residential school era and a rising wave with a canoe and two children representing the First Nations recovering from the experience. The base is made of concrete and the canoe and children are carved red cedar. This is a Squamish Nation design and installation designed by Jason Nahanee, who was a residential school survivor who started attending St. Paul’s at the age of 3, he also carved the red cedar elements. It is located on the school site where St. Thomas Aquinas High School currently resides. There is a 4’x 8’ plaque with room with at least 400 names of students that attended and includes a history of the school's opening. The designer of the plaque is a close family member of a residential school survivor named Shain Jackson. The monument was funded by Ustlahn Social Society of the Squamish Nation, The Indigenous Women's Studies Institute (Founded by Kultsia Barbara Wyss), The Squamish Nation, The Sisters of the Child Jesus, The Oblates of Mary Immaculate, and The City of North Vancouver. The memorial was completed in June 2014.
