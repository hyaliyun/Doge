The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration. The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow. Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas. Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Arizona ash (Fraxinus velutina), arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii), red willow (Salix laevigata), California fan palm (Washingtonia filifera), and invasive species such as salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima), giant reed (Arundo donax), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.

Its mission statement is \\"Supporting the provision of quality welfare services for seafarers and their dependants.\\" The Board‚Äôs key objectives are to: * Help improve the effectiveness of all those charities caring for merchant seafarers, fishermen and their dependants and this is done irrespective of nationality, religion or ethnic background. * Strive to ensure that all welfare needs are met through the most effective deployment of resources. * Facilitate the work of Constituent organisations through the provision of grants and specialist support services. * Provide a dedicated welfare support and referral service for UK seafarers and their dependants. * Manage and support Port Welfare Committees to develop local welfare services. * Encourage and enable closer collaboration amongst both Constituent organisations and Port Welfare Committees. * Represent and raise awareness of seafarers‚Äô welfare issues at national level. The benefits of National Seafarers‚Äô Welfare Boards and Port Welfare Committees are enshrined within the International Labour Organization‚Äôs (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention 2006, Regulation 4.4. The Board is the world‚Äôs oldest established Seafarers‚Äô Welfare Board and the ILO has used it as a template for the appropriate parts of this Convention. Today the Board has over 40 member organisations subscribing to its Constitution, with which it works in close collaboration to provide support services. There are also fifteen Port Welfare Committees (PWCs) within the UK with another in Gibraltar. The PWCs are strategic partnerships dealing with local seafarers‚Äô welfare issues, needs, projects and grant funding. Membership is open to all organisations directly concerned with the welfare of seafarers. Council The Board‚Äôs Council (the directors) consists of trustees appointed by the ship owners or ship managers (via the UK Chamber of Shipping), the two UK maritime trade unions (Nautilus International and National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers), the maritime charity sector and also persons able to make a particular contribution to the work of the charity. Finance The Board‚Äôs primary source of funding is from investment income. Whilst it does not proactively fundraise, it is always grateful for donations and legacies, which are used to enhance its work. Principal Activities =Welfare Support= Welfare support is provided using the Board's unique and comprehensive knowledge of the UK maritime charity sector, together with a wide network of industry contacts. It aims to place those, from a seafaring background and their families, who are seeking practical or financial assistance, in touch with maritime charities and other organisations best able to help. The Board also operates the Seafarer Support Helpline for the entire UK maritime charity sector - Merchant Navy, Royal Navy, Royal Marines and fishing fleet. This unique referral service is aimed at directing enquirers to maritime welfare organisations that are best suited to help in times of need. =Port Welfare Committees= The Board manages 16 Port Welfare Committees covering the entire United Kingdom coastline and also Gibraltar. These collaborative committees promote partnerships that co-ordinate and support welfare services for seafarers at a local level. =Grants= Whilst the Board does not provide grants to individuals, it regularly provides capital and start-up grants to its Constituent Member charities. =Courses= The Board provides a range of training packages for its Constituent and Port Welfare Committee members. =Projects= The Board undertakes numerous collaborative projects on behalf of its many Constituent Members. These include evaluation and feasibility studies, databases of various aspects of the maritime charity sector, the award winning online Maritime Charities Welfare Guide and the Ports Welfare Vehicle Replacement Programme. =Publications and information= The Board publishes on line and in hard copy: * Port Information Leaflets for the use of all seafarers visiting many UK ports and Gibraltar. * A practical guide for seafarers and their families dealing with loss of a close family member. * In preparation is a guide covering the responsibilities of the various organisations dealing with vessels that have been detained or arrested. This is aimed at matters that have an effect on crew welfare. =Collaboration with International Agencies= The Board‚Äôs constitution allows it to support maritime welfare in the UK and Crown Dependencies. As the longest established National Seafarers‚Äô Welfare Board it also collaborates, in an advisory capacity, with international agencies involved with seafarers‚Äô welfare. The Board has been contracted and funded, by the International Seafarers Welfare and Advice Network (ISWAN), to conduct a pilot project to encourage the establishment of welfare boards, in other parts of the world, in accordance with ILO‚Äôs Maritime Labour Convention, 2006. History The Merchant Navy Welfare Board was established in 1948 following a review initiated, five years earlier, by the Government. As a consequence it took over and enhanced the role of its predecessor, the Seamen‚Äôs Welfare Board which, in 1938, had taken over the work of the British Council for the Welfare of Merchantile Marine dating back to 1927. The membership of its Council, as now, came from ship owners, seafarers' trade unions and nautical charities, but also Government. Originally, funding was provided by the Government via levies imposed on British ship owners employing the many non-domiciled seamen. These companies were required to contribute the equivalent of the employer‚Äôs national insurance contribution for each overseas seafarer they employed. Fifty percent of the income was given to the Board, the remainder to another maritime charity. At that time (1948) the Board inherited a number of hotels and clubs from the Seamen's Welfare Board, most of which were refurbished, although a few were sold. The Port Welfare Committees were also transferred and most charities caring for merchant seafarers and fishermen became Constituent members. Changes in merchant shipping and the reduction of the UK fleet from the 1970s onwards had a major impact on the need for hotels. Over a comparatively short period, all but one in central London became redundant, whilst the two remaining clubs were transferred to the seafarers' 'missions'. With the demise of the UK fleet Government support and direct involvement was also withdrawn. Fortuitously the sale of the hotels provided working capital that was invested to provide the primary income source for the Board's continuing work. In 2002, the Board took the view that the London hotel was no longer serving its original purpose and this was sold for redevelopment. The capital raised was added to its investment portfolio which greatly increased the Board's income. This enabled it to provide much greater levels of support to its Constituent Members and indirectly, via them, to seafarers and their families. This includes the work outlined above. The United Kingdom ratified the ILO‚Äôs Maritime Labour Convention 2006 in August 2013. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency, responsible for implementing this Convention in the UK, publicly recognises the importance of the Board‚Äôs role within this. In turn the Board‚Äôs Council sees its role, work and importance in supporting seafarers‚Äô welfare increasing in the future.

Another example is Pseudolioceras, whose unkeeled specimen was used as type for description of invalid genus Praehaploceras. Oxyconic forms of this subfamily (Polyplectus and Sphenarpites) does not have any keel. Ribs were single, but in some genera also bifurcating with shapes from sigmoidal to falcate. Sometimes, shell can have only striate ribs or is smooth (Sphenarpites and older specimens of Eleganticeras and Ovaticeras). Tubercules are rare. Dimorphism is known in some genera and it is observable mostly in size. Macrochons can be 4, to 6 times larger than microconchs. As an example, macroconchs of Pseudolioceras are more than 150mm in diameter, while adult microconchs are only 35-50mm. There are big size differences even within dimorphs.

Distribution for subfamily is worldwide. All genera have been found in northern hemisphere, but only fossils of Harpoceras, Osperleioceras and Polyplectus comes also from southern hemisphere. Timeline and evolution If Protogrammoceratinae shall be considered a valid subfamily, then Harpoceratinae might be of polyphyletic origin with at least 2 main lineages, both evolving from Protogrammoceratinae. First one started in upper Pliensbachian (Spinatum zone) when Tiltoniceras evolved from Lioceratoides, or Protogrammoceras. In Toarcian, during lower part of Exaratum subzone of Falciferum zone it evolved into Eleganticeras, which soon gave rise to Cleviceras. Polyplectus evolved from this genera. Second lineage originated from Protogrammoceras, which has been predecessor for Harpoceras. Three genera evolved from this genus - Osperleioceras (from Harpoceras subplanatum), Ovaticeras (from Harpoceras falciferrum) and Pseudolioceras (probably also from Harpoceras falciferrum). Pseudolioceras is the only known member of this subfamily that lived also in middle Jurassic. Last common ancestor of both these lineages might have been Protogrammoceras that lived in Spinatum zone of Pliensbachian or sooner. Some authors (Knyazev et al., 2007) does not recognize validity of Cleviceras and place its species still in Harpoceras, while they considers Harpoceras falciferrum to be descended from Harpoceras exaratum (in most of recent literature is this species member of genus Cleviceras). Origin of the remaining 2 genera is probably unknown. Taffertia lived in Falciferrum zone of early Toarcian (maybe only in Exaratum subzone). Sphenarpites is known from single specimen that comes from early Toarcian.M. K. Howarth 1992. HILDOCERATIDAE IN THE LOWER JURASSIC OF BRITAINJ. Rai, S. Jain 2013.

He made his fortune through tin mines, mostly from the Wheal Reeth mine, but also from the St. Ives Consols mine. He used the Consols mine to create a political base for himself, by building the village of Halsetown to accommodate the mine-workers. The village was within the boundaries of the parliamentary borough of St Ives, allowing Halse patronage of the borough's two seats in Parliament. At the 1820 general election, both seats were taken by Halse's supporters, but his rival the borough-monger Sir Christopher Hawkins pursued him with charges of bribery, and at the 1826 election both Hawkins and Halse were elected. He was defeated at the 1830 election by William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, nephew of the Duke of Wellington, but regained the seat in 1831 and held it until his death.

Description and history The General George Stark House is located north of downtown Nashua, on the west side of Concord Street, just north of a triangular grassy area formed by its junction with Manchester Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, covered by a low-pitch gabled and hipped roof with elongated eaves supported by brackets. It has an irregular plan, with a three-story square tower rising over its entrance, which is set in an arched opening. The main block is finished in flushboarding, while an ell extending west behind the tower is clapboarded. A single-story hip-roofed porch extends across its street-facing eastern facade, with arched openings and a dentillated and bracketed cornice. The house was built by George Stark, a Manchester native and civil engineer who worked on railroad projects across northern New England. He became superintendent of the Nashua and Lowell Railroad in 1857. Design inspiration for the house came from Andrew Jackson Downing's works. The house was used for many years of the 20th century by the local congregation of the Church of Christ, Scientist. Despite this conversion of use, the interior retains many original finishes, including builtin bookcases with glazed doors.

Deployment of scientific material in the North Atlantic - Yvan Griboval - D√©cembre 2013 OceanoScientific Campaign 2013-14 - 10 000 nautical miles (18 520 km) Sailing dedicated to the Science  In November 2006, Yvan Griboval creates the OceanoScientific Programme for SailingOne. The OceanoScientific Programme is the set of activities designed to enable the international scientific community and the IPCC to enrich their knowledge about the causes and consequences of climate change, through the repeated collection of quality data at the ocean - atmosphere interface (oceanographic and atmospheric), especially on sea routes subject to little or no scientific exploration, aboard all kind of vessels but especially sailing ships; guided by JCOMMOPS, the support centre of the Joint WMO - IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology of the United Nations. IPCC, WMO and IOC are specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN). The two main contractual partners of the OceanoScientific Programme from the start are the French research institutes IFREMER and M√©t√©o-France.http://www.cnrm-game- meteo.fr/?lang=en The industrial partner of the OceanoScientific Programme is the German company SubCtech,http://subctech.eu/ headed and created by Stefan Marx, who created a pCO2 sensor. This sensor was compared to others on board the research vessel Polarstern.  Yvan Griboval - Its creator  Self-made man with a scholarship in Rouen (France), Yvan Griboval has early married his passions for sailing and for media, combining the job of professional sportsman, as from 1975 and of journalist-reporter, as from 1979 in French media: L‚Äô√âquipe, Agence France Presse, Voiles & Voiliers, France T√©l√©vision. Yvan Griboval took part in the win of L‚ÄôEsprit d‚Äô√âquipe with Lionel P√©an at the Whitbread 1985-86 (now the Volvo Ocean Race), the crewed race around the world. Then he put his experience and know-how at the service of companies as from 1987‚Äì88, to guide them in their event-driven communication processes based on the exploitation of the Yachting in general and the Sailing, of its competitions, of its champions. Founder and president of the company SailingOne ever since its inception (December 1994), he created the Troph√©e of Sailing Champions in 1990. As from its first edition, the French version of this event was named the Troph√©e Clairefontainehttp://www.tropheeclairefontaine.com/ thanks to the partnership established in the spring 1990 with the eponymous papermaker group (Groupe des Papeteries de Clairefontaine). In November 2006, Yvan Griboval creates the OceanoScientific Programme.  A unique material (collecting oceanographic and meteorologic data)  As from early 2007, Yvan Griboval creates the OceanoScientific System, which is a component of the OceanoScientific Programme and the tool for OceanoScientific Campaigns. This is a \\"Plug & Play\\" equipment for the automatic acquisition and transmission by satellite of at least twelve scientific (oceanographic and atmospheric) parameters - formatted according to the standards of UN agencies. The OSC System is a technological development without any equivalent anywhere in the world when it works for the first time, on 14 October 2009. It makes possible for scientists the access to a new fleet of vessels of opportunity: sailing boats especially dedicated to these scientific missions. A scientific publication was carried out after the first test-expedition in the French Revue de l‚ÄôElectricit√© et de l‚ÄôElectronique (REE), in November 2010.  Data transmission to the International Scientific Community  Yvan Griboval initiates then the OceanoScientific Campaigns, standing for the implementation of the OceanoScientific System. It therefore involves the repeated collection of quality data at the ocean - atmosphere interface and their transmission to the oceanography and meteorology international platforms of the specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN). Data of OceanoScientific Campaigns are transmitted free of charge to the international scientific community considering its own criteria. They are integrated into the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), for example via WMO's Global Telecommunication System (GTS). These observations contribute to improve meteorological and climatological forecasts in scarcely or not at all scientifically explored ocean areas. The two first campaigns carried out are: The ARTIC MISSION 2012 on the schooner La Louise in the Baffin Bay between 65¬∞ and 70¬∞ North; the 96-days ANTARCTIC MISSION 2013, on the three-master Bark EUROPAhttp://barkeuropa.com/ (Netherlands) between 50¬∞ and 63¬∞ South, especially in the Drake Passage.  OceanoScientific Campaign 2013 - 2014  Started from Brest (France) on 28 November 2013, the OceanoScientific Campaign - ATLANTIC MISSION 2013 - 2014, led on the 16-meter Navire A Voile d‚ÄôObservation Scientifique de l‚ÄôEnvironnement (NAVOSE) bearing the colours of the MEROCEANS foundation, came to an end in Monaco on 26 April 2014. In addition to the tests of the OceanoScientific System (OSC System) Version 3.0, a unique material collecting data of ten scientific parameters at the ocean - atmosphere interface, this 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 km) expedition enabled the deployment of drifting scientific materials in compliance with the requirements of JCOMMOPS, a UNESCO agency. In the meantime, the OSC System won the 2013 French-German Prize of Economy in the Environment category. As from now one, the scientific data collected by the OSC System will be transmitted to the CORIOLIShttp://www.coriolis.eu.org/ network. This Campaign was carried out in energy self-sufficiency, without any CO2 emission, thanks to the hydro generators installed on board.

John Stark House is a historic house museum at 2000 Elm Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. The house, a single-story Cape style farmhouse, was built in 1736 by Archibald Stark. Stark's son John, a hero of the American Revolutionary War, lived in this house from 1736 to 1765; it is where he brought his new bride Molly, and where two of their children were born. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is now operated as a museum by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Description and history The General John Stark House is located north of downtown Manchester, at the southwest corner of Elm and Waldo Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. A single-story ell extends to the rear, giving the house an overall L shape. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a multilight transom window, and nine-over-six windows in the flanking bays. The interior follows a typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule and parlors on either side of the chimney. The kitchen extends across much of the back, with small chambers in the corners, with the stairway to the attic in the northwest corner. The house was built on the farm of Archibald Stark in 1736, and is where his family was raised. Originally located on Canal Street, the house remained in the Stark family until 1821. It was acquired by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in 1835, and used for worker housing. In 1937 the company donated the building to the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, which restored the property and adapted it for use as a meeting site. It was moved to its present site, which is also part of the Stark farm, in 1968.

The Balinese is also known as the purebred long-haired Siamese, since it originated as a natural mutation of that breed and hence is essentially the same cat with a medium-length silky coat and a distinctively plumed tail. As is the case with their short-haired counterparts, a genetic distinction is made between traditional or \\"old-style\\" and modern body types. In the American standard, color variants derived from the Colorpoint Shorthair are further considered a separate breed, known as the Javanese. There is no particular connection between these cats and the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java, from which they derive their names. Like their Siamese ancestors, Balinese are sociable, vocal, playful and inquisitive, and an intelligent breed. History and development Sylvia Holland, pioneer Balinese breeder The \\"Balinese\\" is not actually from Bali or any part of Indonesia. Its history begins with the first Siamese cats that were imported from Thailand to the U.S. and UK in the mid-1800s, some of whom carried the recessive long-haired gene. The Balinese breed subsequently originated from deliberate breeding efforts based around this naturally expressed genetic trait. Initially, occasional long-haired kittens in Siamese litters were considered a fault in the bloodlines and sold exclusively as pets. There are records of these cats as early as the 1900s; \\"Long-haired Siamese\\" were first registered as show cats with the American Cat Fanciers' Federation in 1928. In the mid-1950s, breeders in the US began serious efforts to develop the long-haired variant as a separate breed. Considering Long- haired Siamese too cumbersome a name, initial breeder Helen Smith dubbed the new breed \\"Balinese\\" as a reference to the grace of Balinese dancers. Sylvia Holland's Balinese kittens, circa 1971 A breeder named Sylvia Holland (who was also an illustrator for Walt Disney Studios) worked to further establish the breed standard in the 1960s and 1970s. She recognized only cats showing the classic Siamese points in seal, chocolate, blue and lilac as true Balinese, refusing to accept others on the grounds that they had likely originated from crosses with other breeds. The American Cat Fanciers' Association had meanwhile officially classified Siamese with the newer red and cream as well as lynx (tabby) and tortoiseshell (or \\"tortie\\") patterned points as a separate breed, the Colorpoint Shorthair, and the long-haired cats derived from these colors and patterns were subsequently likewise classified separately as \\"Javanese\\", in keeping with the Indonesian island theme. Like their Siamese ancestors, the Balinese gradually split into two separate varieties based on physical type. The traditional Siamese (also called old-style or \\"apple-head\\", now being separately developed as the Thai), was the type in vogue when the Balinese was established, and hence used in its development; these old-style Balinese still closely resemble those from the early breeding programs. As the parent short-haired Siamese gained in popularity, however, a trend developed in favor of a more extremely elongated, slender type with a distinctively wedge-shaped head. The modern (or \\"contemporary\\") Balinese was subsequently derived directly from this newer Siamese ideal. By the mid-1980s, the old- style Balinese, like their Siamese counterparts, had disappeared from most cat shows, with the exception of a few breeders who maintained the original Balinese type. The two varieties of Balinese thus have very few if any recent ancestors in common. = Balinese-Javanese = Modern chocolate tortoiseshell- point Javanese There was discussion in the Cat Fanciers' Association about merging the two breeds into one breed with two color divisions as early as 2006. The Javanese is a hybrid between Colorpoint Shorthair and Balinese. In 2008, breeders in the Balinese Breed Council and Javanese Breed Council voted to combine the Balinese and Javanese as one breed and declared Javanese as a color division of the Balinese. The Cat Fanciers' Association was the only organization to believe that Javanese was a separate breed. This does not affect the colors or description of Balinese, since they are two separate divisions but they are just placed under the Balinese. Javanese will still has the same colors as before, along with Balinese having the same colors mentioned below. This movement has brought The Cat Fanciers' Association more in line with the other worldwide registries. The Cat Fanciers' Association made this change since the two councils in their organization (Balinese and Javanese) were overlapping around an average of 50 to 75% with the same members who breed and exhibited the two types. Combining the two breeds will hopefully increase Balinese registration in the Cat Fanciers' Association, by encouraging new breeders and exhibitors of Balinese to come forth and present their cat. They also wished to show more Javanese of the appropriate coat length in the shows. This will also help decrease the number of cats needed to maintain a healthy breeding program. Description =Appearance= The two types of Balinese are still analogous to their Siamese counterparts. While both are relatively slender, graceful fine-boned cats with long legs and tail, neat oval paws, almond-shaped eyes and large pointed ears, the traditional type is overall the more substantial, with a broader head and sturdier body. The modern type features a noticeably more wedge-shaped head with long tapering muzzle and longer, broader ears, atop a more slender and elongated body. Old-style lilac point Traditional chocolate point Balinese Modern blue lynx point Javanese =Coat and color= The coat is basically medium-length (although there can be considerable variance by individual) and should be soft and silky, without the fluffy undercoat typical of most long-haired breeds. The offspring of two Balinese will have a longer coat than that of a Balinese and a Siamese. In all cases, the tail should have a definite plume, or fringe, of longer hair. Eye color ranges from pale blue through sapphire/violet; intensity of color can change slightly with age and diet. The paw pad color can be used to identify the color point in kittens. Pink pads are found in chocolate and lilac points; while dark pads are found in blue and seal points. Like all cats with the point pattern, Balinese kittens are born pure cream or white and gradually develop visible points in colder parts of their body ‚Äì the face, ears, paws and tail. Their color is identifiable by the time they are four weeks old. Some cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult Balinese cats living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates. The Cat Fanciers' Federation and most other associations worldwide accept the Balinese breed in seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red and cream point, besides tortoiseshell and lynx points in all of these colors. The Cat Fanciers' Association standard continues to accept the Balinese in only the classic seal, blue, chocolate and lilac points, with all other possible colors and patterns classed separately as Javanese. Old-style seal point =Temperament= Balinese share the traits of the short-haired Siamese, and hence are notably social and playful cats with an intense interest in the activity around them and a tendency to vocalize often and persistently, albeit at a lower volume. They are reputed to have the highest intelligence of all the long-haired breeds. They are also reputed to be notably acrobatic, and to enjoy intimate contact with their owners. =Hypoallergenic claims= Anecdotally, many people claim that Balinese cats cause fewer problems with allergies than most cat breeds. While strict scientific evidence for this is lacking, it has been determined that, in comparison to most cats, the Balinese produces very low amounts of the Fel d1 and Fel d4 protein allergens. As with the Siberian cat breed, some Balinese breeders and clubs are working together to produce more rigorously tested evidence of the Balinese's hypoallergenic quality. Genetics The pointed pattern is a form of partial albinism, resulting from a mutation in tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. The mutated enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures, but becomes active in cooler areas of the skin. This results in dark coloration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, including the extremities and the face, which is cooled by the passage of air through the sinuses. Though crossbreeding with other breeds took place in order to produce the less traditional Javanese colors, they are considered purebred cats if they are registered and have at least 3-4 or more generations of Siamese or Balinese lineage.  Health Problems  They are considered a healthy breed with only few health problems. They are a pedigree breed, which means they are developed from such a small gene pool of Siamese with the long hair mutation. The smaller the gene pool, the more chances they are to inherited many unknown health disorders. A possible confirmed disease for Balinese is Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), which is a degeneration of the retina in the eye; which may lead to weak or impaired vision. There has been some cases of Balinese having dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a disease that enlarges the heart muscles that decreases heart function. There are also some claims that they are at a low risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Another potential health problem is liver amyloidosis, or systemic amyloidosis which eventually leads to failure of some organ, most commonly the liver. Liver amyloidosis typically occurs in any members of the Siamese and the Balinese is a mutation off the Siamese, so it may have any inherited disorders directly to Siamese. They sometimes developed a rare inheritance that makes their blue almond shaped eyes look cross eyed. It is called Strabismus, which is common in Siamese cat breeds.

Indigenous Australians have other names for the plant, the Yindjibarndi peoples know it as burduwayi, the Ngarluma as burduwari, the Nyangumarta call it kawarr and the Kurrama peoples know it as mangkalangu. Description It grows as a resinous, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, in height, with grey or reddish-brown minni ritchi bark. The plant normally has a V shaped form with a openly branched spreading crown at times with sparse foliage present. The evergreen phyllodes have an elliptic to obovate shape and are slightly asymmetrical. The blade is in length and wide and has three to five main longitudinal nerves. It produces yellow flowers from April to August. The simple inflorescences have fragrant, globular to obloid or occasionally shortly cylindrically shaped flower heads that are in length with light golden flowers. The flowers are not very densely packed in the heads and are relatively large in size. The leathery seed pods that form following flowering are brown in colour and slightly shiny. Each pod has a narrowly oblong shape and is mostly flat but raised over the seeds. The pods are in length and wide, they are sticky with resin and have a sweetly aromatic smell. The shiny deep brown seeds within the pods have an obloid-ellipsoidal shape and are in length and wide. Taxonomy The species was first formally described as Acacia monticola by the botanist John McConnell Black in 1937 as part of the work Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. It was reclassified by as Racosperma monticola by Leslie Pedley in 1987 then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2001. The only other synonym is Acacia impressa. The species name is taken from the Latin words montanus meaning mountain and cola meaning dweller. The name was chosen by Black as the collections of all the specimens of the time all came from rocky tablelands and ranges such as the MacDonnell Ranges. It is often confused with Acacia trachycarpa as they both have the same style of minni ritchi bark. Distribution and habitat A. monticola has a scattered distribution from Western Australia eastwards through the Northern Territory to central western Queensland. It occurs on red sand, ironstone or lateritic soils in pindan, and on stony plains and rocky ridges. In northern Western Australia it is found in the Central Kimberley, Central Ranges, Dampierland, Gibson Desert, Great Sandy Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Northern Kimberley, Ord Victoria Plain, Pilbara and Tanami IBRA bioregions.

The ship transported gunpowder and munitions during World War I as USS Guantanamo and as a cargo ship during World War II for the War Shipping Administration (WSA). After 12 October 1943 the ship was assigned to the Southwest Pacific Area command's permanent local fleet as the United States Army transport Grey Lag with that fleet's number X-101. In April 1945 she was one of the transports towing large barges from Australia and New Guinea to the Philippines after that concept to mitigate shipping shortages had been proven feasible. In 1946 the ship was sold to the Republic of China and renamed Hai Lung. Construction The cargo ship Registan was built and launched on 9 May 1910 by William Gray & Company Ltd., West Hartlepool, County Durham, United Kingdom with engines supplied by Central Marine Engine Works of the same city for Anglo-Algerian Steamship Co. (1896) Ltd., an operating line of the Frank C. Strick & Company. The ship was completed in July of that year. The Anglo-Algerian Steamship Co. had been founded to transport coal from South Wales to France and with the sister company, merged to form Strick Line in 1913, extended to serve Mediterranean ports and the Persian Gulf. This was the second ship of the name to operate for the company with five more to follow with the seventh built 1973. Operational history Very shortly after delivery Registan was sold in 1911 to the New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company and renamed Guantamano. The ship was operating with that company until World War I military shipping requirements ended her civilian career for the duration. =USS Guantamano= S.S. Guantamano served as USS Guantanamo (ID # 1637) from 20 May 1918 to 25 January 1919. During 1917 Guantamano was inspected by the Third Naval District for use in 1919. On 25 February 1918, the ship was turned over to the U.S. Navy at Philadelphia, commissioned on 21 May 1918 as USS Guantamano (ID-1637), and began service transporting gunpowder and ammunition to forces in Europe. The ship made three voyages in convoy before arriving in New York on 11 December 1918 and being decommissioned on 25 January 1919. The ship was returned to her owners, New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company. =Interwar years= In 1927 Guantamano was renamed Comerio operating with another subsidiary of the same line and in 1940 sold to Italian interests and renamed Vittorin. =World War II= Vittorin, idle at Norfolk, Virginia since June 1940, was detained at March 1941 and seized under the Act of June 6, 1941, Public Law 101-77th Congress, 46 U.S.C.A. which provided for seizure \\"during such emergency charter or requisition the use of, or take over the title to, or the possession of, for such use or disposition as he shall direct, any foreign merchant vessel which is lying idle in waters within the jurisdiction of the United States, including the Philippine Islands and the Canal Zone, and which is necessary to the national defense\\" with ownership passing to the War Shipping Administration. The ship, renamed Grey Lag, was placed in service 15 October 1941 with South Atlantic Steamship Company as the WSA operating agent. On 2 October 1941 at New York WSA changed the operating agent to U.S. Navigation Company. Effective 22 January 1943 at Brooklyn, New York the ship was bareboat chartered to the War Department for operation by the U.S. Army. By 12 October 1943 Grey Lag had arrived in the Southwest Pacific Area and was incorporated into the Army's permanent local fleet operating under the U.S. Army Services of Supply (USASOS SWPA) of General MacArthur's command. The ship's dispatch to SWPA was in response to a request for hulls of \\"moderate draft\\" of between 4,000 and 6,000 dwt suitable for troop and cargo operations in the islands north of Australia with limited and shallow ports. In particular ships built on the Great Lakes, where size was determined by locks, were suitable with the requirement being met by ships generally termed \\"Lakers\\" or \\"Lake-Type Vessels\\" whether or not the ships were actual Lake vessels; though the majority delivered had been built and operated there. Grey Lag, though definitely not of Great Lakes origin, was one of the \\"Lakers\\" delivered under the request. By 1 December Grey Lag was one of fifty-two ships of the mixed fleet composed at the time largely of Dutch vessels, mostly Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM) ships from the Netherlands East Indies, and other allied vessels from Singapore and the Japanese conquest of the Indies that had sought refuge in Australian ports. The ship was assigned the local fleet designation number of X-101. By 15 July 1944 the ship was in a group assigned to the sub-fleet of ships operating in the New Guinea coastwise service (ADSOS Fleet) as AX-101. With a shortage of tugs, the invasion of the Philippines underway and an urgent need to move small and unpowered craft with cargo from New Guinea to Leyte, Grey Lag acted as a tow and as a cargo vessel. =Post war= Sometime after 27 April 1946 Grey Lag was released from Army service, acquired by Coastwise Steamship and sold on 19 September 1946 to the Republic of China, Shanghai represented by the Chinese Supply Commission. The ship was renamed Hai Lang and operated until scrapped in Taiwan January 1960.

Established in 1803 by Ebenezer Barrett, the farm layout and buildings represent a well-preserved example of a rural hill country farm of the 19th century, which survived in part by being transformed into a gentleman's farm in the early 20th century. It is on this farm that noted yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm was founded. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Barrett farm is set on of land in the rural upland area of northern Wilton and southern Lyndeborough. Much of its land is now wooded, but there are cleared fields surrounding the farmstead complex, which is located at the end of Barrett Hill Road, and bisected by a formerly public right-of- way known as Old Coach Road, portions of which are lined by old stone walls. The complex includes an 1803 Federal style brick farmhouse, a 19th-century barn, a garage which was added c. 1920, and a c. 1927 greenhouse which was moved to the farm c. 1950. The farm was established by Ebenezer Barrett, a migrant from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, in 1803. The farm was worked by Barrett and two generations of descendants during the 19th century, and became a gentleman's farm in the early 20th century. The property was leased in 1978 to the Rural Education Center, a non-profit agricultural education organization. The center was run by Samuel Kaymen, and it is here that the yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm was founded.

The malware was created by Russian hacker Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev. It is believed to have been spread through use of the Cutwail botnet. Unlike its predecessor the ZeuS trojan, Gameover ZeuS uses an encrypted peer-to-peer communication system to communicate between its nodes and its command and control servers, greatly reducing its vulnerability to law enforcement operations. The algorithm used appears to be modeled on the Kademlia P2P protocol. Scammers control and monitor Gameover ZeuS via Command and Control (C&C;) server. The virus establishes the connection to the server as soon as its malicious executable installs on the computer, at which point it can disable certain system processes, download and launch executables, or even delete essential system files, easily making the system unusable. According to a report by Symantec, Gameover ZeuS has largely been used for banking fraud and distribution of the CryptoLocker ransomware.

This rehabilitation project was designed in 1988 by the architect Patrick Berger under the direction of the SEMAEST (Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôEconomie Mixte d‚ÄôAm√©nagement de l‚ÄôEST de Paris). It is hosting a section of the Promenade Plant√©e, and many art galleries and shops. History In 1853, the private company ‚ÄúSoci√©t√© de Chemin de Fer Paris Strasbourg‚Äù was granted to build a train line crossing Paris 12th arrondissement from Bastille to Verneuil l‚ÄôEtang, going through Vincennes. This project implied considerable works such as digging tunnels or building infrastructure objects such as the ‚ÄúViaduc de la Bastille‚Äù a 1,5 km long viaduct made of 64 vaults. The train line was opened in 1859, but ceased in 1969 after the creation of the RER A line into which a part of the line was integrated, while the Paris-Vincennes was completely abandoned. In 1979, the APUR (Atelier Parisien d‚ÄôUrbanisme) was commissioned to rethink the disused viaduct that follows the Rue de Lyon and the Avenue Daumesnil, along with the choice of reconverting the station of Bastille into a new Opera house (Opera Bastille). Two options came up for the future of the viaduct : * The first option was to demolish it in order to implement new buildings along the street. * The second option was to reconvert the railroad into a promenade, and to make use of the space under the vaults as well as of the dilapidated plots neighbouring the viaduct. But the presence of well maintained building directly behind the viaduct dismissed the first option. In fact, the rehabilitated viaduct could host many activities and constitute a much more welcoming fa√ßade for the Avenue Daumesnil. In 1983, the implementation of the ‚ÄúPromenade Plant√©e‚Äù linking Place de la Bastille to Bois de Vincennes constituted one of the most important projects for the revitalization of the Eastern neighbourhoods of Paris. The project was run by landscape architect Jacques Vergely and architect Philippe Mathieux. In 1988, the proposition of the architect Patrick Berger was chosen for the reconversion of the arcades into a strip of art galleries, and the first part of the promenade plant√©e (from Rue Picpus to Rue Michel Bizot) was opened one year later. The inauguration of the vaults started in 1994 until 1997 when the last vaults were opened. The design of the rehabilitation project mainly consist on cleaning the viaduct and closing the vaults with a glass wall on the two sides. The central part of the arches were cleared out in order to add relief in the fa√ßade and let the shadow underline the curved shape. This intervention enabled the use of the 64 vaults whose size varies between 150 and 460 m¬≤ and the implementation of a strip of art galleries and caf√©s.

It currently comprises two electoral wards, Aberdare East and Aberdare West, for the purposes of electing members to the Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Aberdare East is composed mainly of a part of Aberdare itself while Aberdare West includes the community of Llwydcoed which, for many years was itself as electoral ward. Aberdare Town first became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of Glamorgan County Council. Aberdare Town was also one of the five electoral wards of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894. The other wards were Aberaman, Blaengwawr, Gadlys and Llwydcoed. History 1889-1914 =Glamorgan County Council 1889-1914= In 1889, David Price Davies became the first Liberal member for Aberdare Town. Davies was returned unopposed again in 1892. Following David Price Davies's elevation to the aldermanic bench in 1892, the by-election was said to have created an intense amount of enthusiasm and more excitement than has been known to an election in this parish for many years. In 1895, Thomas Thomas was defeated by John William Evans. In 1898, David Price Davies's term as alderman came to an end but Evans declined to stand down in his favour, as was the convention when there were two sitting members of a similar political persuasion. Davies consequently withdrew, resulting in the loss of his aldermanic seat. Evans was made an alderman after the election, possible to facilitate Davies's re- election. At the resulting by-election, Thomas Thomas, the former member, was initially nominated but withdrew allowing Davies to be returned unopposed. However, Davies had now lost his primacy as the senior representative. In 1901, Davies was defeated by David Hughes. Hughes stood aside in 1904 at the end of J.W. Evans's aldermanic term. Hughes was returned at the by-election. Hughes narrowly held the seat in 1907, having been opposed by Edward Morgan, a leading member of the district council. Aberdare Urban District Council Aberdare (Town) was also an electoral ward of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894. Thomas Thomas, the sitting member and a former county councillor was said to have been removed as candidate by the Liberal and Labour Association in favour of Lewis Noah Williams, a prominent local businessman and son of William Williams (Carw Coch). John William Evans, who had ousted Thomas from the seat at the 1895 election was also nominated but also withdrew before the poll. 21st century Aberdare is currently made up of two wards, Aberdare East and Aberdare West, for the purposes of Rhondda Cynon Taf unitary authority elections. Since 1995 it has been represented by Labour councillors.

From 1995 on, UTSCH developed extensive security concepts for license plates. By using laser-codes, holograms, graphics or coats of arms, license plates turned into national high security documents. In 1998, Utsch developed and built the worldwide largest automatic production facility for license plates for the Italian state in Foggia where all license plates are centrally produced. In 2002, Utsch introduced the first windshield label with transponder technology as an electronic identification document. Between 2008 and 2009 Utsch realized the three biggest orders in value of over 30. Mio. ‚Ç¨ in the Arab world.http://www.utsch.com/en/company/history.html In 2012, the company produced more than 50 million vehicle license plates worldwide.https://www.welt.de/moto/news/article126207039/Schlaue-Schilder.html Schlaue Schilder (in German) In the same year Erich Utsch AG and J. H. T√∂nnjes GmbH & Co. KG (the two world leaders in security license plate technology) founded a joint venture: UTI (Utsch T√∂nnjes International).http://www.utsch.com/en/company/history.html In December 2018, Erich Utsch AG sold its shares in UTI to T√∂nnjes. At the same time, Erich Utsch AG acquired a majority interest in the Australasian Group, LicenSys Australasia Pty Ltd.. In September 2016, the sale of the majority shareholding owned by Manfred Utsch became known. In future, it belongs to a Swedish and Australian group, represented in the negotiations by Ian George and Anders Eriksson. Manfred Utsch stated that the sale will support the business continuity and safe the jobs at the location Siegen in long term. He himself will only perform an advisory task in the future.  Products  Since the company‚Äôs foundation the core business has been the production of vehicle license plates including manufacturing tools and production facilities. Already in 1965, Utsch launched its first mechanical embossing press. In 1975, the first ‚ÄúAutomatic Embossing Press‚Äù was introduced to manufacture vehicle license plates in large quantities in a computer-controlled and fully automatic process. The 2013 launched upress is able to allow biometric login, optic control and continuous documentation of the workflow. The upress closes the gap between manual and automatic production and hinders wrong printings by accident or by purpose. With a slightly downscaled version, the upresslight, UTSCH is opening up an economical way for smaller embossing firms to introduce networked technology. Next to this classical engineering, UTSCH today offers complete system solutions for companies, public authorities and entire states, coverings all aspects of production, personalization, registration and identification in a modular and highly customizable manner. UTSCH has successfully developed license plate frames with a variety of finishes to allow license plates to be fitted on vehicles from virtually all brands and manufacturers without screws.

It played in London and New York in 1906 with Lena Ashwell in the lead role. It tells of a South African farmer's wife trapped in an unhappy marriage who falls in love with a visiting Englishman. In a dramatic scene the husband is killed. The death is made to seem an accident, but the lovers must part. Later the play was changed to give it a happy ending. The Shulamite was well received in London, but had limited success in the USA. It was made into a silent film The Shulamite in 1915, later renamed as The Folly of Desire, and in 1921 was made into the silent film Under the Lash with Gloria Swanson. Background The play is a dramatisation by Edward Knoblock of the novel The Shulamite by the prolific romance writers Alice and Claude Askew. The Shulamite, probably meaning \\"the woman from Shulem\\", is a Biblical character mentioned in the Song of Solomon. She was the bride of a shepherd, but her great beauty attracted Solomon, who tried to win her for his harem. Plot The story is set in the Transvaal, South Africa. Deborah is the wife of the brutal farmer Simeon Krillet, who beats her. She falls in love with Waring, an Englishman who is staying with them to learn farming. Waring tries to escape the situation, but his horse is struck by lightning and he has to return. He finds that Krillet has read his diary and knows about the love between him and Deborah. Waring defends Deborah, and is forced to kill Krillet in self- defense. The couple takes the body to Waring's horse, making it seem that Krillet had died in the lightning strike. When Waring plans to return to England where his alcoholic wife is dying, Deborah becomes jealous and tells the true story of Krillet's death to his sister. She agrees not to reveal the secret on the condition that the lovers never meet again. London production The play had only six characters, so could be staged at low cost, which made it attractive to Lena Ashwell's syndicate. It opened at the Savoy Theatre in London on 12 May 1906, with Ashwell in the lead role and Norman McKinnel as Krillet. The play ran for 45 performances at the Savoy between 12 May and 26 June 1906. The cast was: *Lena Ashwell as Deborah Krillet *Norman McKinnel as Simeon Krillet *Henry Ainley as Robert Waring *Eugene Mayeur as Jan Vanderberg *Elsie Chester as Tante Anna Vandenberg *Beryl Mercer as Memke On 12 June the play was revised to give the third act a happy ending. The critic J. T. Grein called the production melodramatic and in poor taste. However, the Evening Standard was enthusiastic about Ashwell's dramatic performance. The Era said it was, United States Ad from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of 2 December 1906 Ashwell took The Shulamite across the Atlantic, introducing it in Chicago. The Shubert Brothers produced the play in the United States. Advance notices said \\"The Shulamite, according to the London reviewers, ranks even ahead of Pinero's His House in Order as the most powerful play of the London season.\\" Later reviews were tepid. A New York critic warned theatergoers on 21 October 1906, \\"Miss Ashwell has been a competent and prominent actress in London for several years now, but in reading of her work I have never seen the emphasis placed so heavily on her poetic and imaginative qualities as the Chicago brethren place it. The quality is fortunate and timely, because from all accounts The Shulamite, which we shall see next week, sadly needs poetry for its appreciation.\\" The play opened at the Lyric Theatre, New York, on 29 October 1906, and closed the next month after just 25 performances. It was directed by J. C. Huffman. The cast was: *Lena Ashwell (her Broadway debut) *John Blair *George Le Guere *Edward R. Mawson *Maude Granger *Beryl Mercer (her Broadway debut) The New York Times critic wrote that Ashwell \\"had been rather badly handicapped on her first visit here by a bad play ... Miss Beryl Mercer, who appeared as a little Kaffir slave, is most to be commended for a bit of character that is pathetically appealing. After New York, the play was staged in the Shubert Theatre in Brooklyn in December 1906. Film versions The Shulamite was made into a film in 1915, later renamed The Folly of Desire, directed by George Loane Tucker. The cast was: *Norman McKinnel as Simeon Knollett *Manora Thew as Deborah *Gerald Ames as Robert Waring *Mary Dibley as Joan Waring *Gwynne Herbert as Mrs. Waring *Minna Grey as Tanta Anna *Bert Wynne as Jan Van Kennel The Shulamite was used as the basis for the 1921 silent movie Under the Lash starring Gloria Swanson, Russell Simpson and Mahlon Hamilton, directed by Sam Wood. The dark and gloomy screenplay, and Swanson's role without glamorous gowns and jewellery, was a deliberate change from her former roles. The movie included advanced special effects in the storm sequence, where trees were blown up to appear as though they had been struck by lightning.

The episode aired on May 20, 2014 in the United States on FX. It was written by series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley and directed by Colin Bucksey. The title refers to the paradox in logic known as Buridan's ass. In the episode, Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton), police officers Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) and Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks), and hitmen Mr. Wrench (Russell Harvard) and Mr. Numbers (Adam Goldberg) all end up involved in a chaotic and deadly shootout in the middle of a snow storm. Meanwhile, Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) tries to implicate someone else for the murders of his wife and Chief Thurman, while Stavros Milos' (Oliver Platt) torments come to an unforeseen conclusion. \\"Buridan's Ass\\" was very well received by critics and was seen by 1.80 million viewers. It was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special for Bucksey. Plot Lorne Malvo has Don Chumph place the call to Stavros, who has the money ready for the drop. Malvo knocks Chumph unconscious and duct tapes him to an exercise bench in the entry way of his house. He also duct tapes an unloaded shotgun to his hands and proceeds to fire randomly into the neighborhood with another gun. Malvo quickly exits via the back door before police arrive. They are duped into firing upon and then storming the house, killing Chumph who is struggling wildly to get free of his bonds. Molly Solverson is visiting Gus Grimly in Duluth to discuss the recent murders when gunshots are reported. At the scene they find a car wreck that Numbers and Wrench staged to trap Malvo. Numbers and Wrench then attack with automatic weapons; Malvo escapes the ambush and captures and tortures Numbers to tell him who sent them. Numbers replies, \\"Fargo\\" before Malvo fatally slits his throat. Molly and Grimly get separated and Gus accidentally shoots her. Meanwhile, Stavros goes back to the roadside where he originally found the briefcase of cash, and buries the blackmail money there, believing God has been punishing him. Feeling God's forgiveness, Stavros calls his bodyguard to bring his son, Dmitri, home from the remote hideout he was staying at. The stormy weather clears, but not before fish fall out of the sky in a freak occurrence caused by the storm, causing the bodyguard to flip the car, killing himself and Dmitri, a scene that Stavros happens upon on his drive home. Back in Bemidji, Lester Nygaard manages to sneak out of the hospital, stealing a car. He takes the murder weapon, some photos of his wife, and a pair of her panties from his house, hides everything in his brother Chazz's hidden gun cabinet, and places one of his brother's unloaded guns in his nephew Gordo's backpack, to ensure the police will search Chazz's house. As he leaves the house, Gordo sees him, but does not react. Lester then returns undetected to his hospital room, where a satisfied smile slowly creeps across his face.

Another positive review came from IGN writer Roth Cornet, who gave the episode a 9.3/10 \\"amazing\\" rating and said \\"Lester Nygaard continued his descent into a moral wasteland, Gus Grimly's ineptitude may have yielded tragic and deadly consequences, and Lorne Malvo escaped death in what was one of the most emotionally dark and visually pretty episodes of Fargo to date.\\" =Accolades= At the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, Colin Bucksey won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Dramatic Special for this episode.

This allows the use of HTML5 video to play back DRM-wrapped content such as streaming video services without the use of heavy third-party media plugins like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight. The use of a third-party key management system may be required, depending on whether the publisher chooses to scramble the keys. EME is based on the HTML5 Media Source Extensions (MSE) specification, which enables adaptive bitrate streaming in HTML5 using e.g. MPEG-DASH with MPEG-CENC protected content. EME has been highly controversial because it places a necessarily proprietary, closed component which requires per-browser licensing fees into what might otherwise be an entirely open and free software ecosystem. On July 6, 2017, W3C publicly announced its intention to publish an EME web standard, and did so on September 18. On the same day, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who joined in 2014 to participate in the decision making, published an open letter resigning from W3C.  Support  In April 2013, on the Samsung Chromebook, Netflix became the first company to offer HTML5 video using EME. , the Encrypted Media Extensions interface has been implemented in the Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers. While backers and the developers of the Firefox web browser were hesitant in implementing the protocol for ethical reasons due to its dependency on proprietary code,Mozilla begrudgingly brings Netflix support to Linux with DRM in Firefox Firefox introduced EME support on Windows platforms in May 2015, originally using Adobe's Primetime DRM library, later replaced with Widevine library. Firefox's implementation of EME uses an open-source sandbox to load the proprietary DRM modules, which are treated as plug-ins that are loaded when EME-encrypted content is requested. The sandbox was also designed to frustrate the ability for services and the DRM to uniquely track and identify devices. Additionally, it is always possible to disable DRM in Firefox, which then not only disables EME, but also uninstalls Widevine DRM libraries. Netflix supports HTML5 video using EME with a supported web browser: Chrome, Firefox,Netflix system requirements for HTML5 Player and Silverlight Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer (on Windows 8.1 or newer), or Safari (on OS X Yosemite or newer). YouTube supports the HTML5 MSE. Available players supporting MPEG-DASH using the HTML5 MSE and EME are NexPlayer,NexPlayer: Passion for High Quality Video Services THEOplayerTHEOplayer by OpenTelly: HLS and MPEG-DASH player for HTML5 MSE and EME by OpenTelly, the bitdash MPEG-DASH player,bitdash MPEG-DASH player for HTML5 MSE and EMEbitdash HTML5 EME DRM demo area dash.jsdash.js by DASH-IF or rx-player. rx-player Note that certainly in Firefox and Chrome, EME does not work unless the media is supplied via Media Source Extensions. Version 4.3 and subsequent versions of Android support EME. = Content Decryption Modules = Adobe Primetime CDM (used by old Firefox versions 47 to 51) * Widevine (used in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera among others) * PlayReady (used in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 8.1) * FairPlay (used in Safari since OS X Yosemite)  Criticism  EME has faced strong criticism from both inside and outside W3C. The major issues for criticism are implementation issues for open-source browsers, entry barriers for new browsers, lack of interoperability, concerns about security, privacy and accessibility, and possibility of legal trouble in the United States due to Chapter 12 of the DMCA. There are potentially security issues introduced by running any form of DRM software, which would be obscured by the fact that all implementations are proprietary. Exposing DRM modules that cannot be properly audited to web content, which is untrustworthy, may result in such software being abused and/or attacked by any website the user visits with the DRM software enabled. While Firefox does attempt to prevent malicious code from escaping its sandbox, there is no guarantee that the sandbox will work. In July 2020, Reddit started running a javascript program that launches a fingerprinting attack (which makes it possible to persistently track individuals around the web) against the user's web browser. Part of the script attempts to load every possible DRM module that browsers can support, and logs what ends up loading as part of the data collected. Users noticed this when Firefox began alerting them that Reddit \\"required\\" them to load DRM software to play media, although none of the media on the page actually needed it. As of 2020, the ways in which EME interferes with open source have become concrete. None of the widely used CDMs is being licensed to independent open-source browser providers without paying a per-browser licensing fee.

The hospital gave its name to the Quinze-Vingts quarter.  History  The Hospice des Quinze-Vingts, a hospital for the blind, was founded in 1260 by Louis IX, king of France, also known as \\"Saint Louis\\". It was constructed on a piece of land called \\"Champ-Pourri\\",J-A Delaure et Gabriel Roux, Histoire de Paris, 1853, p. 132 an area lying a short distance west of the Louvre fortress, outside the fortified wall built by Philippe Augustus from 1190 to 1209. It became included within the city after the erection of the new fortified wall of Charles V built between 1356 and 1383. Within the new neighborhood thus formed west of the Louvre, it was located on rue Saint-Honor√© at the corner of the rue Saint-Nicaise, (in the area between the Palais-Royal and Place du Carrousel, whose construction post-dated of several centuries that of the Quinze-Vingts). The name Quinze-Vingts, which means three hundred (15 √ó 20 = 300), comes from the vigesimal (based on 20) numeral system used in the Middle Ages: it referred to the number of beds in the hospital, and was intended to house 300 poor, blind city-dwellers.Dictionnaire universel, g√©ographique, g√©n√©ral, statistique, historique et politique de la France, Tome 4 (P-SAJ), Imprimeur Beaudouin, Paris, 1804, p. 51 In 1779, during the reign of king Louis XVI, the Cardinal de Rohan transferred the hospital to its current location, rue de Charenton, in the former barracks of the \\"Black Musketeers\\", (Mousquetaires noirs, named for the color of their horses), which had been disbanded in 1775. Rohan also changed the system of administration and increased the number of beds to eight hundred.J-A Delaure et Gabriel Roux, Histoire de Paris, 1853, p. 133 In 1801, during the Consulate, the hospital was housing the Institute for the Young Blind founded by Valentin Ha√ºy in 1784. Between 1957 and 1968, large parts of the former barracks of Black Musketeers were demolished. What was left - entrance and chapel - was classified Monument historique (historical monument) on 26 December 1976. Up to this day the Quinze-Vingts remains a hospital for eye diseases. It also houses the Vision Institute (Institut de la Vision), an ophthalmology research center that opened in 2008.

Its CPU is a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core MediaTek processor. It has 1 gigabyte of RAM. A 5 megapixel rear camera and 2 megapixel front camera are included. The A10 has two front-facing speakers with enhancements from Dolby. A microSD card slot allows storage expansion. Wi-fi 802.11b/g/n are supported, as is Bluetooth 4.0. With a capacity of 6,340 mAh, the A10 offers relatively long battery life. The A10's shell is dark blue and has a smooth, matte finish, with rounded corners. It weighs 1.2 pounds. The A10 has what Lenovo calls a \\"Smart Side Bar\\" that offers easy access to recent apps and shortcuts for display controls. It can be swiping from the bezel to the center of the screen. Lenovo packages the A10 with an app from Dolby Audio to manage sound settings. The A10 ships with Android 4.4.2 with an upgrade to version 4.4.3 available for download.

Still, I'd go as far to say that the A10 has the best speakers on any tablet in its price range, and that's not something to ignore. Personally, if I were in the market for a 10-inch budget tablet, I'd be torn between Lenovo's tablet and Samsung's. If you're looking for a decent tablet at a decent price, the Lenovo A10 should at very least be on your consideration list, despite the troubling display resolution.\\" References Tablet computers ","title":"Lenovo A10 tablet"},{"id":"42965220","text":"Best FM is a Hindi-language entertainment radio station in Mauritius that is owned and broadcast by the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation.

The film was theatrically released in India on June 3, 2016, and grossed billion worldwide on a budget of million.  Plot  The film starts in London. Three robbers attempt to steal jewels from a building, but are captured by the police. Six years later, Batook Patel, a wealthy and successful businessman, is shown disapproving marriage of his three beautiful daughters, Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswat, as he believes that the previous ladies in his family were doomed because of marrying. One night, at a friend's party, the girls reveal to their friend that secretly, they each have a boyfriend who are Teddy, a wannabe racer, Bunty, who wants to be a rapper and Sandy , who wants to own his own football club. When the girls tell their dad about them, Batook takes help of a restaurant owner Aakhri Pasta who dresses up as the family's fortune teller who claims that when the girl's husbands first see, speak to, or set foot into Batook's house, Batook will die. The girls, wanting to keep their boyfriends, make them have fake disabilities. Sandy pretends to be crippled, Teddy blind and Bunty mute. At Pasta's restaurant, Batook reveals to Pasta that his daughters are actually the daughters of Urja Nagre, an underworld crime lord who handed the girls promising not to reveal his name to them as he was in jail. Batook has planned to marry the girls to his three sons, the robbers who tried to steal the jewels. Unbeknownst to him, Nagre has arrived in London. While the girls prepare a wax statue for Batook, the boys go into town, where the boys are observed by him to be disabled. Bunty, appears crippled, Sandy blind and Teddy mute. Later, Nagre asks Batook, about his daughter's future husbands. Batook says that he knows three normal men who are suitable for the daughters. Batook takes Nagre to a Gurdwara to see his sons, Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev, claiming they are orphans who do community service. Nagre chooses the three suitable for his daughters. At Batook's house, Nagre claims that Batook owes him 50 million pounds. Nagre gives the boys 10 days to make up the money, or the girls must marry 'the chosen boys'. During these 10 days, Nagre and \\"his sons\\" will also live in Batook's house, meaning that the girls' boyfriends must act in front of just as they were observed by Batook and Nagre. During a party, the girls get Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev drunk. The next day, they are happy to have sex with their respective girls, only to find out that they had sex with the maids. The maids request compensation, or they will sue them. Nagre surrenders to his daughters' pleas of love. The next day, the girls take their boys to church, for confession because they felt that they were mocking disables by having the boys act as if they were disabled. After this, the boys feel guilty, as they were marrying the girls only for money. They go to the warehouse of Madame Tussauds to meet their girlfriends. They instead find Batook's sons whose goons attack them. While Teddy and Bunty fight them, Sandy hears Teddy say \\"Indian\\", and Sundi arrives, trying to kill Sandy. Batook also arrives who is blackmailed by the boys to divide Nagre's fortune into 7 shares. More people come as shares increase considerably. Nagre arrives, and attempts to kill everyone in the warehouse, while the lights turn on and off. As the girls arrive, Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev see them, and hold them at knifepoint in front of Nagre. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty then rush to save the girls, injuring themselves in the process.

Bert and Ernie are two Muppets who appear together in numerous skits on the long-running children's television show, Sesame Street. Originated by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, the characters are currently performed by puppeteers Eric Jacobson and Peter Linz; Oz performed Bert until 2006. History Bert and Ernie were built by Don Sahlin from a simple design scribbled by Jim Henson, creator of The Muppets. Initially, Henson performed Bert and Oz performed Ernie, but after just one day of rehearsal, they switched characters. The original idea was to show that even though two people can have totally different characteristics, they can still be good friends. According to writer Jon Stone, the relationship between Bert and Ernie reflected the real life friendship between Henson and Oz. Their names are believed to have been drawn from those of two minor characters in the Frank Capra film It's A Wonderful Life. According to A&E;'s Biography, Bert and Ernie were virtually the only Muppets to appear in the Sesame Street pilot episode, which was screen tested to a number of families in July 1969. Their brief appearance was the only part of the pilot that tested well, so it was decided that not only should Muppet characters be the \\"stars\\" of the show, but would also interact with the human characters, something that was not done in the pilot. An ordinary Bert and Ernie sketch involves Ernie coming up with a harebrained idea, and Bert trying to talk him out of it, usually getting him frustrated and Ernie dumbfounded. For example, if Ernie wanted to do something loud if Bert is doing something quiet like reading a book or the newspaper, Bert would teach him how to be quiet; however, Ernie would still make some noise, which would cause Bert to either lose his temper or leave the room. The age of the characters is unclear. Sesame Street Live performer Taylor Morgan said in an interview that \\"I just kind of try to think like a six year old or a seven year old, because that's how old Bert is.\\" Bert Bert was initially performed by Frank Oz. Since 1997, Muppeteer Eric Jacobson has been phased in as Bert's primary performer after Oz retired from most of his Muppet duties to focus on directing. Bert is a ‚Äúhand rod puppet\\", which means that while the puppeteer's right arm is inserted into Bert's head to control the mouth, the puppeteer's left hand uses rods to control the arms of the puppet. Bert has one large eyebrow, known as a unibrow. Ernie Ernie was originally performed by Jim Henson until his death in 1990. From 1993 to 2014, Muppeteer Steve Whitmire took on the role of Ernie. From 2014 to 2017, Billy Barkhurst took on the role of Ernie; currently, the character is performed by Peter Linz. Ernie is a \\"live hand puppet\\", meaning that while operating the head of the puppet with his right hand, the puppeteer inserts his left hand into a T shaped sleeve, capped off with a glove that matches the fabric \\"skin\\" of the puppet, thus \\"becoming\\" the left arm of the puppet. A second puppeteer usually provides the right arm. Ernie's performance of \\"Rubber Duckie,\\" wherein he sings affectionately about his squeaking toy duck and the joy it brings him during bath time, became a modest mainstream hit, reaching No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1970. In popular culture Bert and Ernie are among a handful of Sesame Street specific Muppets to also appear on The Muppet Show, making occasional cameo appearances, such as at the end of The Muppets Valentine Show, the pilot episode of 1974 for the series. While several other Muppets featured on Sesame Street such as Kermit the Frog would cross over into the other program, Bert and Ernie were primarily confined to the occasional cameo. =Sexual orientation discussion= Bert and Ernie live together in an apartment located in the basement of 123 Sesame Street. Despite sleeping in separate beds, they share the same bedroom, which has led to some speculation that they are a representation of gay lovers. This has repeatedly been denied by Sesame Workshop, and some of Bert's interactions with female characters do appear to show that he is attracted to women, like serenading Connie Stevens in the Some Enchanted Evening segment of a first-season episode of The Muppet Show, and recording a song about his girlfriend, \\"I Want to Hold Your Ear\\", which was released on several albums. In July 2013, The New Yorker magazine chose an image of Bert and Ernie by artist Jack Hunter, titled Moment of Joy, as the cover of their publication, which covers the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition 8. Sesame Workshop was reportedly so outraged by the idea that it was rumored to be considering the possibility of litigation. In September 2018, Mark Saltzman, one of the script and songwriters for Sesame Street, alleged in an interview with Queerty that Bert and Ernie were analogues for his own intimate relationship with film editor Arnold Glassman, despite the fact that he did not begin writing for Sesame Street until fifteen years after Bert's and Ernie's first appearance. Sesame Workshop responded by claiming that Bert and Ernie have no sexual orientations, because they are both puppets. Frank Oz, who previously performed as Bert, stated Bert and Ernie were not gay, saying, \\"They're not, of course, a gay couple. But why that question? Does it really matter? Why the need to define people as only gay? There's much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness.\\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sesame-street-workshop-issues- statement-on-bert-and-ernies-sexuality-2018-9 Sesame Street went on to clarify further, stating: No, Bert and Ernie aren't gay ‚Äî they're 'best friends.' The Gaystar news reported that fans reacted negatively to this assertion, on grounds of apparent homophobia. Frank Oz later tweeted in September of 2018, \\"A last thought: If Jim and I had created Bert and Ernie as gay characters they would be inauthentic coming from two straight men. However, I have now learned that many view them as representative of a loving gay relationship. And that's pretty wonderful. Thanks for helping me understand.\\" Morgan, J. (2018, September 28). Sesame Street actor Frank Oz changes his mind after gay Bert and Ernie debate. Retrieved March 21, 2020, from https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sesame-street-actor-frank-oz-changes-his- mind-after-gay-bert-and-ernie-debate/ =Parody and other uses= From March 30, 1997, to ca. 2002, the parody website \\"Bert is Evil\\" displayed Bert in a number of doctored photographs, implicating him in crimes ranging from the Assassination of John F. Kennedy to those of Jack the Ripper. A similar image from another source and featuring Bert conferring with Osama bin Laden was mistakenly included by a Bangladeshi print shop on a series of protest signs in October 2001 and 2002.BBC News - Bert in the frame with Bin Laden The comedy sketch series from Germany, Freitag Nacht News had a recurring sketch called Bernie und Ert created by Attik Kargar, who performed the puppets and supplied the voice of Bernie. Bernie and Ert are an obscene parody of Ernie and Bert, and especially redubbed on Sesamstrasse. The puppets had no nose, one eye each, and swapped hairstyles. Each sketch focused on such topics as crime, drug abuse and Friday the 13th. In February 2003, Bernie and Ert were dropped from the series because of legal concerns; however, older episodes circulate on the internet. They also appeared in a Freitag Nacht News sequence called Bullzeye in a sketch called \\"Popo Club\\". Bernie & Ert wore black masks and leather jackets, disguised as Unknown No. 1 and Unknown No. 2 respectively, with another character named Winfred, propagating bizarre sexual practices. This skit became popular that it resulted in more skits called \\"Popo Club\\" featuring Unknown No. 1 & 2, with occasional appearances by Winfred. The film It's a Wonderful Life (1946) includes a taxi driver named Ernie and a policeman named Bert. Jerry Juhl, a writer on many Henson projects, said that the film did not influence the creation of these two Muppets: \\"Despite his many talents, Jim had no memory for details like this. He knew the movie, of course, but would not have remembered the police officer and the cabdriver.\\" The special by Sesame Street, Elmo Saves Christmas, refers to the coincidence: in the special, It's a Wonderful Life plays on television continuously and, near the end, the Muppets Bert and Ernie walk by the television set and stop short when they hear their names mentioned in the movie. In the pilot episode of Eerie, Indiana, which aired in 1991, Marshal and Simon are subtly asked for help by a pair of twin brothers named Bertram and Ernest (called Bert and Ernie for short), because their mother has forced them to sleep every night in her Forever Ware containers, thus having kept them at age twelve for over thirty years. This could allude to the fact Bert and Ernie have not aged in all the years that Sesame Street has aired. In April 2013, a pair of high energy neutrinos detected at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, possibly of extragalactic origin, were nicknamed \\"Bert\\" and \\"Ernie\\". The British soap opera EastEnders has confirmed that characters Bert and Ernie Moon are named after the Muppets. On the animated series of 1996, Dexter's Laboratory, there are two puppet characters named Mitch and Clem who appear on a fictional series TV Puppet Pals. They are most likely a parody of Bert and Ernie. Claims that Bert and Ernie are Puerto Rican, or were based loosely on a middle school teacher in Manassas, Virginia, are unfounded, and have been debunked as urban legends by Snopes.

The song was written and produced by Kevin Patterson and Chic Medley. Background After the early 1984 top 10 UK hit with \\"(Feels Like) Heaven\\", the band's follow-up singles \\"Ghost of Love\\" and \\"All or Nothing\\" were commercial disappointments, with the former only reaching the UK top 75. The debut album Throw the Warped Wheel Out also failed to make the charts. By the time Fiction Factory began to write and record the follow-up album Another Story, a major change in band personnel had occurred, as the original members keyboardist and writer Eddie Jordan, drummer Mike Ogletree and bassist Graham McGregor had left the band. This left lead vocalist Kevin Patterson and guitarist Chic Medley to become the two remaining members, who in turn hired guest musicians for the recording of the album such as keyboardist Paul Wishart, guitarist Pim Jones, percussionist James Locke and brass player Graham Weir. The song, like the entire album, was recorded and mixed at The Planet, Castle Sound and Amazon Studios. \\"Not the Only One\\" was the album's lead single, and like the two following single releases, it was a commercial failure. The album was also a flop, and the band disbanded shortly after. The album has since become out of print. The album's only CD release from Instant Records in Germany was limited and has become a collectors item, often selling for prices up to ¬£500. \\"Not the Only One\\" did not have a promotional music video, but it was the only song to be performed on a TV show from the album. It was performed on the German TV show Musik Convoy on 6 May 1985. One main form of promotion was the small number of UK concerts the band performed around the time of the single and album release. Release The single was released via 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl in the UK, Germany, Italy and Canada. Mainly released through Foundry Records, Virgin Records released the single directly in Canada. \\"Not the Only One\\" was the first single to be issued from Foundry Records - a UK independent label. The 7\\" vinyl single featured the non-album B-side \\"Let Me Be a Part\\" - a song also written and produced by Patterson and Medley. This song was soon added as one of two bonus tracks on the 1985 CD release of Another Story, a limited issue in Germany by the label Instant Records. This was the only appearance outside of the single. The 12\\" vinyl release featured a six-minute extended mix of \\"Not the Only One\\", as well as an exclusive mix of the same song titled \\"Not the Only One ('Mix' Mix)\\" and \\"Let Me Be a Part\\". The extended version of the song was the other of two bonus tracks on the CD issue of Another Story, where it was titled \\"Long Version\\". The \\"'Mix' Mix\\" version is largely notable from having removed all lead vocal from the song, but still keeping some backing vocal. A white label promo test pressing was also issued in the UK. The single featured a full colour sleeve, with different front cover photographs between the 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl versions, but the overall same design. The 7\\" vinyl artwork saw Patterson and Medley standing on a rooftop overlooking a European city, whilst the 12\\" vinyl photograph showed the pair from a low-angle photograph, with a church tower in the background. Both photographs are uncredited. Aside from the song's release on the Another Story album, and as a single, the song would also appear on three various artist compilations. The first two, both from 1985, was the Virgin Records European release Rock '85 (English Style) and the Virgin Records, Greek release Rock 80's Vol. 6. In 1987, it appeared on the German CD compilation Another Christmas Gift from Line, released by Line Records.

The company had its roots in the Rossendale area and the most significant investor was William John Porritt, a woollen manufacturer from Helmshore. His money contributed to the building of St Anne's and restored confidence in the project after some early problems.  Early days of the company  The Clifton Family of Lytham Hall, owners of the Manor of Lytham in Lancashire, guided by their land agent James Fair began planning for a new town in the area as early as the 1840s. During the 1850s they invested in the railway between Lytham and Blackpool which was Lytham Hall front entranceopened in 1863. In the early 1870s a road was laid from what is now Fairhaven to the present St Anne's Square and a further road continued to the Parish Church of St Anne which was built in 1872/3 and funded by Lady Eleanor Cecily Clifton. The church gave the name to the new town of St Anne's on the Sea. In 1874, the St Anne's on the Sea Land and Building Company was formed by eight Rossendale men led by the chairman Joseph Wood Whitehead. This company negotiated 999 year leases with Thomas Fair who had succeeded his father James as the Clifton's agent. This company sought to develop what became known as the Square Mile in the centre of St Anne's. The architects for the project were Maxwell and Tuke of Peel Chambers, Bury. James Maxwell himself came from Haslingden in Rawtenstall and these men later went on to design Blackpool Tower. The ambitions for an exclusive and select resort can be seen in an early company document which states, \\"of late years Blackpool has become so much the resort of Excursionists that a decided want is felt for a watering place which, whilst possessing the same bracing atmosphere and commanding position, shall secure a more select and better class of visitors\\"!The Clifton Papers at Lancashire Archives (Ref:DDCL) The first lease between the Company and the Clifton estate was signed on 14 December 1874. Work began on the development of the Promenade and the St Anne's Hotel in February 1875 and the foundation stone of St Anne's on the Sea was laid in the hotel on 31 March of that year.Lytham and Kirkham Times, 7 April 1875, p.8 At the ceremony Joseph Whitehead commented \\"..perhaps many would be surprised at the scheme being taken up by Rossendale people. After relating the circumstances which led to the negotiations with Col. Clifton, he said that an arrangement was made with Mr. Fair by which 82 acres of land had been secured upon a long lease, a portion of which they had been upon that day. The company was floated and had succeeded beyond their expectations. It was their intention, as a large sum of money had been subscribed, to build as quickly as possible.\\" http://www.amounderness.co.uk/st.annes-on-the-sea_foundation_stone_1875.html  William John Porritt and the progress of the company  Perhaps the most important Rossendale influence on the development of St Anne's was William John Porritt who was born in Ramsbottom in 1828.William John Porritt of Helmshore and St Anne's on the Sea Working with his father Joseph in the firm of Joseph Porritt and Sons he built Sunnybank Mill in Helmshore in 1866 and bought Higher Mill in the same town in 1880. He was present at the laying of the foundation stone of St Anne's and soon after joined the board of the Land and Building Company, being the chairman from 1881 -1896. The success of the scheme to develop St Anne's on the Sea wasn't guaranteed. In the 1880s and 1890s it was struggling financially and various factors such as the opening of the pier and, most significantly, the continued investment of William Porritt ensured its success. He is particularly well known for the 'Porritt Houses' that were built north of the pier. St Annes on the Sea Pier - geograph.org.uk - 956228It's thought that he built property to the value of ¬£100,000 in St Anne's ‚Äì by today's standards he invested millions of pounds in the area.Shakeshaft, Peter (2008). St Anne's on the Sea: a History, p. 160-161. Carnegie Publishing Ltd, Lancaster. As well as these prime-movers who wanted to invest in and oversee the development of St Anne's on the Sea other Rossendalians came to live and work in the town during the early years of its development. Some of these were evidently men of business and their families but a look in the census records also reveals many 'working' people including several individuals who came to work in the building trade in the newly developing town. The 1890s Ordnance Survey map shows the town in the early stages of its development ‚Äì the town centre is taking shape and the pier and promenade are in place. There are several churches and chapels and the Porritt houses on north promenade have been built. The subsequent maps for 1911 and 1932 show the rapid extension of the resort with new housing going up, the expansion of the promenades, more churches being built along with the Carnegie Library and Technical School and the development of Ansdell and Fairhaven between Lytham and St Anne's. After Porritt's death in 1896 the company continued to prosper although from the late 19th century its role became less one of development and was more concerned with leasing land and collecting ground rents. In 1951 the company was purchased by Amalgamated Investment and Property Company. This company went into receivership and ceased trading in 1979.Shakeshaft, Peter (2008).

Biography Rosinger was born in New York City and received his bachelor's degree in history from the City College of New York before completing a master's degree in Far Eastern Studies from Columbia University in 1936. After teaching history in New York City high schools for four years, he took a job working for the Foreign Policy Association this led to visiting lectureships at Columbia University and the University of California, Berkeley during World War II. Work in China At the close of the war in 1946, Rosinger was sent to China as a representative and reporter for the Foreign Policy Association. He traveled extensively throughout China visiting areas controlled by both the Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists. His time in China convinced him that the Nationalist government, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, was moribund. Rosinger believed the Chinese Communist Party was supported by the vast majority of the Chinese people and that American attempts to subvert it would handicap American Asia policy by casting the United States as an imperial power in the mold of Great Britain and France. He urged the United States to support a unified, progressive China even if it came at the cost of short-term disruption in American access to Chinese markets and of American missionary interests there.Lawrence K. Rosinger, China's Crisis, 258-259. Publications He published numerous books and articles on Asia. His first two books, China's Crisis (1945) and China's Wartime Politics (1944), focused on the preconditions that caused a resumption of the Chinese Civil War after the failure of the Marshall Mission in 1947. Both books were praised by critics and earned Rosinger a position as research associate at the American Institute of Pacific Relations in 1948. After joining the IPR, Rosinger was a frequent contributor to both its scholarly journals Pacific Affairs and Far Eastern Survey. By the end of the 1940s, he had expanded his interests to India, and published two books Restless India (1946) and India and the United States (1950) about India's role in Asia and its impact on American foreign relations in decolonizing South Asia. \\"Restless India\\" was favorably reviewed by critics with John Bicknell of the New York Times calling it, \\"a useful little fact book\\" covering the politics of India after securing its independence from the United Kingdom.John Bicknell, \\"Gandhi and the Future of India\\", (New York Times, May 19, 1946): BR1. Political difficulties In 1950, Rosinger's criticism of Chiang Kai-shek and support for decolonizing South and Southeast Asia ran him afoul of Congressional loyalty committees. He edited a survey of Asian politics, called \\"The State of Asia\\" (1950), which attempted to synthesize Asia's political tumult between 1945 and its publication in 1950. Rosinger's contributions to the volume were criticized for being too sympathetic to the Chinese Communist cause. Yale University's Richard L. Walker, in a review for the New York Times, remarked on the volume's \\"high standards\\" but warned that \\"Mr. Rosinger uses loose terminology, presentation of false alternatives, and innuendo to present a one-sided picture of the Chinese Communist Regime.\\"Richard L. Walker, \\"Asia in Upheval\\" (New York Times June 21, 1951): 73. He was labeled as pro-communist by University of Washington China scholar Karl A. Wittfogel during Wittfogel's testimony against Owen Lattimore before the Tydings Committee. The next year he was called before the McCarran Committee to testify about his involvement with the Institute of Pacific Relations, which was being investigated as a pro-communist organization. He refused to cooperate with the Committee, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and refused to discuss the beliefs and political affiliations of his colleagues at the Institute of Pacific Relations.Lawrence K. Rosinger's Testimony Before the Senate Committee on Un- American Activities Investigating the Institute of Pacific Relations, 1952: 2475-2514. Rosinger's appearance before the McCarran Committee damaged his career. Beginning in 1952 he withdrew from public life, moving to Detroit and working as a hardware store manager. He later took a job working at Henry Ford Community College in Detroit where he would work for over twenty years teaching English.Finding Aid for the Lawrence K. Rosinger Papers, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor: http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-9541?rgn=main;view=text In 1973, as normalization of Sino-American relations began under President Richard M. Nixon, Rosinger was invited to tour China. He spent twenty-five days in the country touring its major cities including Shanghai and Beijing. Rosinger was granted an audience with Ye Jianying, a powerful political and military figure whom Rosinger had met in the 1940s.

Life King was born on 14 February 1922, and attended Latymer Upper School before going up to Jesus College, Cambridge University, graduating in about 1942 with a first class honours degree in mathematics. He then joined the Scientific Civil Service as part of the Ministry of Defence (Navy). After obtaining a PhD from Imperial College, he became Chief Scientist at the Naval Construction Research Establishment, Rosyth. Set up during World War II to carry out research on underwater explosions and the best structural design features to resist explosive damage, by the 1950s the Naval Construction Research Establishment was investigating structural strength issues for submarines, aircraft carriers, and floatings docks. In particular, design problems in construction, welding, brittle fracture, and the development of stronger steels. Substantial experimental facilities existed on site in Rosyth, including universal testing machines of up to 500 tons capacity, and high pressure chambers for hydrostatic tests. In 1968, King was appointed as the sixth Regius Professor of Engineering in the University of Edinburgh, and became Head of its Department of Mechanical Engineering. His main research interests lay in materials science. He expanded the department‚Äôs activities in vibration, and heat and mass transfer, as well as materials science (this latter work being supported by his former government employers). He also encouraged the new work in the department on wave power. In the year preceding King‚Äôs arrival at the university, a School of Engineering Science had been formed. With the professors from the Departments of Chemical, Civil, and Electrical Engineering he restructured the undergraduate degree course into a new four year honours curriculum that contained a substantial element of common subjects in the first two years. He married Pamela Hitchcock in 1951; they had a son and a daughter. Professor King retired in 1983, and died about 1995.

As the definition of a CCG refers to the way a game is played, rather than aspects of the game itself, a CCG can be played in any genre. However, according to CCG streamer Zach Gerlock, Role- Playing Games (RPGs) are the most compatible, because this genre generally does not require reaction-based input. A CCG will intake commands from multiple players and will issue them to the avatar. However, as players cannot predict what other players will input, the movements and actions of the avatar can be incredibly erratic depending on the game's input mode. Styles of play =Anarchy= Anarchy-mode allows all commands by players to be issued in sequential order to the avatar. This method of gameplay allows all individuals the equal ability to influence the movement or actions of the avatar, but none the ability to control it with strategy or rationale. Anarchy-mode is very susceptible to Trolls, which makes narrative progress difficult with this style of gameplay. However, players of anarchy-based CCGs often play for the communal experience, rather than the game's story. These players will often collectively create a new narrative based on their unpredictable gameplay. Archived from the original on June 6, 2014. Retrieved February 13, 2018. =Democracy= Democracy-mode allows all commands within a set period of time to be collected, counted and subject to the majority rule. This method of gameplay will issue only the command that is voted for the most (within each block of time), allowing strategy and methodology to be used. While democracy-mode is effective in allowing narrative progress, it often requires planning, voting and agreement between the majority. Unlike anarchy- mode, democracy-mode is protected well against Trolls, unless the majority is made up of them. Current examples =Twitch Plays Pok√©mon= On 12 February 2014, an anonymous programmer from Australia streamed a game of Pok√©mon Red onto the video game live streaming website Twitch. Rather than passively watching the streamer play, viewers of Twitch Plays Pok√©mon were able to actively participate by typing commands into the stream's chatbox. While the original Pok√©mon Red was a single-player role-playing game, the use of the streamer's code allowed the game to be re-mediated into a CCG. Community-controlled games may exist as either a remediated single-player game or as a game designed to be played by a community. Categories of CCGs =Remediations= Currently, most CCGs exist as remediations of single-player games. To convert a single-player game into a CCG, the only requirement is for the controls to be opened up to multiple players. A remediation features changes solely to the gameplay mechanics, leaving everything else unchanged. =Dedicated CCGs= A dedicated CCG is a game made specifically to be a community-controlled game. These games will be developed with an awareness of their audience, and the narration will address the community as a whole during tutorials or throughout the game. These games will either feature a third- person plural narrative, or what Game Theorist Chris Milando calls a fourth- person narrative.

History Heizer was created in the 1880s primarily out of the need for an additional railway stop Northwest of the city of Great Bend, Kansas. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was in the process of building lines heading out to the Southwest after Colonel Cyrus K. Holliday gained charter to the company in 1859 and gained land grants through Kansas and Texas.Dye, Victoria. All Aboard for Santa Fe : Railway Promotion of the Southwest, 1890s to 1930s, University of New Mexico Press, 2007. The railroad that was built through Great Bend was one such line. The town was named after David N, Heizer, one of the founders of Barton County and the former Mayor or Great Bend who once owned the land that Heizer was built on.Biographical History of Barton County, Kansas. Great Bend Tribune, 1912. Print. pgs 78, 79. https://books.google.com/books?id=hnYUAAAAYAAJ For several decades the small frontier settlement boomed with the height of the railroads in Kansas. At one point the town had over 100 residents. It was at this point that most of the businesses were established in the town. However, time passed and life on the Kansas plains grew more difficult, particularly with the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Dust Bowl, which hit the area particularly hard. People began to leave Kansas in the 20th century just as quickly as they had come in the 19th. Like many towns in the area,http://www.ipsr.ku.edu/ksdata/ksah/population/2pop33.pdf Heizer suffered a severe population decrease that continues to this day. Heizer is currently estimated to have approximately 20 residents. =Historical businesses= The entrance to the Heizer bank as it is today At its peak, the town of Heizer had numerous places of business that were owned and operated in the town. They included: Train Depot (seen here in its prime), blacksmith, hotel, stockyard, lumberyard, church, school, several grain elevators, general stores, hardware store, Heizer Creamery Co, bank established in 1911. Many of these businesses can be seen in the 1902 map here. None of these businesses are in operation today. Only a few of the original buildings still exist, and most are condemned. =Walnut Creek Bridge= In 1887, Barton County opened contract bids for four iron bridges within the county. The Walnut Creek Bridge, to be constructed 0.5 mi. North and 0.5 mi. West of Heizer,http://bridgehunter.com/ks/barton/50651505163 was given to C.R. Lane of Topeka, Kansas. Lane was the manager of Topeka's office of the Lane Bridge and Iron Works, a company which provided a variety of metalworking services throughout the Midwest. The company was given $3,700 for the contract, which is equivalent to about $92,204.69 today.http://www.in2013dollars.com/1887-dollars-in-2017?amount=3700 The Walnut Creek Bridge \\"is a pin connected Pratt through truss\\" which spans 115' long and 16' wide with a wood deck 21' above Walnut Creek.http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/nominationsNRDB/KS_BartonCounty_MetalTrussBridgesMPS_walnutcreekbridgeNR.pdf The bridge is unique due to the fact that it is constructed of wrought-iron, which is no longer used in bridge construction with steel being preferable. Additionally, of all Pratt through truss bridges, the Walnut Creek Bridge is the only one known to be constructed by P.E. Lane, who worked for the Lane Bridge and Iron Works company. The bridge was completed in 1887, meaning that horses and wagons were the first vehicles to use the bridge, although eventually it carried cars.Bickel, Amy. Bridge Spans a Lost Age in Engineering. Hutchinson News, The (KS), 2010. Although the bridge was officially listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, marking it as a structure of historical importance, it was not enough to save the bridge from falling into disrepair. Today the bridge has been abandoned and its main wooden deck has been removed, as well as the structure as a whole being deemed structurally deficient and likely for imminent failure. Photos of the bridge when it was still in use can be seen here and the bridge can also be seen from satellite here.

The band's debut album Kammerspiel was released in February 2011 on Gizeh Records, and their sophomore \\"On Floating Bodies\\" on Chemikal Underground in March 2013.  Early history (2008-2010)  Kampman and Scott met at university in Edinburgh, and began collaborating in 2008.Radar Music Blog : Conquering Animal Sound Taking their name from an article about the Conquering Lion sound-system group, they released a free mixtape titled \\"Your Friends, Conquering Animal Sound\\" on download and cassette, and began gigging around Scotland. In 2010 they were approached by new label Gerry Loves Records, and released their debut single \\"Giant\\" on 7\\" and download.  Kammerspiel (2011)  Gizeh Records released their debut album \\"Kammerspiel\\", which The Skinny (magazine) called \\"a remarkable unveiling ... the organic and the electronic coexisting beautifully\\". The Line of Best Fit heralded it \\"one of the most accomplished debuts 2011 will see\\", and Drowned In Sound praised Kammerspiel's depth, as it \\"simultaneously managed to capture on record the full depth of their creativity and imagination, as well as the inherent beauty of their sound\\". The album was recorded and mixed entirely by the band in Kampman's flat, and she discussed this lo-fi approach, which informed the album's title, in an article with the Skinny. > I had the word Kammerspiel in mind for a long time.

The album was preceded by the single \\"The Future Does Not Require\\", and was released on the Chemikal Underground label in March 2013. The List (magazine) praised the album's \\"daring and gloriously rich palette\\", and included it in their Top Ten Albums of 2013. The album takes its title from Archimedes‚Äô treatise on hydrostatics, and Mike Diver wrote for the BBC that the album is \\"not always comfortable, but consistently engaging ... persist and there‚Äôs real beauty to be found in its digitised designs\\". The Herald (Glasgow) called it \\"cosmic, disorientating and sublime\\", and in an article with the paper, the band discussed their writing processes. > Rather than having the lyrics or the melody and writing everything down, we > write everything up ‚Äì we create a sound we like and just see where it goes. > We work up from the stuff that other people might use ornamentally ‚Äì that‚Äôs > the seed that starts the song for us.

Region-specific factors for immigration = Europe = Citizens of one member nation of the European Union are allowed to work in other member nations with little to no restriction on movement. This is aided by the EURES network, which brings together the European Commission and the public employment services of the countries belonging to the European Economic Area and Switzerland. For non-EU-citizen permanent residents in the EU, movement between EU-member states is considerably more difficult. After 155 new waves of accession to the European Union, earlier members have often introduced measures to restrict participation in \\"their\\" labour markets by citizens of the new EU-member states. For instance, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain each restricted their labor market for up to seven years both in the 2004 and 2007 round of accession. North African immigrants near the Italian island of Sicily Due to the European Union's‚Äîin principle‚Äîsingle internal labour market policy, countries such as Italy and the Republic of Ireland that have seen relatively low levels of labour immigration until recently (and which have often sent a significant portion of their population overseas in the past) are now seeing an influx of immigrants from EU countries with lower per capita annual earning rates, triggering nationwide immigration debates. Spain, meanwhile, is seeing growing illegal immigration from Africa. As Spain is the closest EU member nation to Africa‚ÄîSpain even has two autonomous cities (Ceuta and Melilla) on the African continent, as well as an autonomous community (the Canary Islands) west of North Africa, in the Atlantic‚Äîit is physically easiest for African emigrants to reach. This has led to debate both within Spain and between Spain and other EU members. Spain has asked for border control assistance from other EU states; the latter have responded that Spain has brought the wave of African illegal migrants on itself by granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of undocumented foreigners. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany have seen major immigration since the end of World War II and have been debating the issue for decades. Foreign workers were brought in to those countries to help rebuild after the war, and many stayed. Political debates about immigration typically focus on statistics, the immigration law and policy, and the implementation of existing restrictions. In some European countries, the debate in the 1990s was focused on asylum seekers, but restrictive policies within the European Union, as well as a reduction in armed conflict in Europe and neighboring regions, have sharply reduced asylum seekers. =Japan= Some countries, such as Japan, have opted for technological changes to increase profitability (for example, greater automation), and designed immigration laws specifically to prevent immigrants from coming to, and remaining within, the country. In 2007, minister Taro Aso described Japan as unique in being \\"one nation, one civilisation, one language, one culture and one race\\". In 2013, Japan accepted only six of 3,777 persons who applied for refugee status. Japan is a highly unattractive migrant destination compared to other major industrialized countries; according to Gallup the number of potential migrants who wished to migrate to Japan was the lowest in the G7 and twelve times less than the number who wished to migrate to the United States, consistent with its low migrant inflows compared to the latter. Some Japanese scholars have pointed out that Japanese immigration laws, at least toward high-skilled migrants, are relatively lenient compared to other developed countries, and that the main factor behind its low migrant inflows is because it is a highly unattractive migrant destination compared to other developed countries. This is also apparent when looking at Japan's work visa programme for \\"specified skilled worker\\", which had less than 3,000 applicants, despite an annual goal of attracting 40,000 overseas workers, suggesting Japan faces major challenges in attracting migrants compared to other developed countries regardless of its immigration policies. =United States= In the United States, political debate on immigration has flared repeatedly. The country has seen unprecedented growth of immigrants since its independence in 1776, most recently for those of Asian descent. Immigration and Western social values Many commentators have raised the issue that immigrants from certain cultures who move into Western countries may not be able to understand and assimilate certain Western concepts, that are relatively alien in some parts of the world, especially related to women's rights, domestic violence, LGBT rights and the supremacy of secular laws in front of religious practices. For instance, in some parts of the world it is legal and socially accepted for men to use physical violence against their wives if they \\"misbehave\\"; and wives are expected, both legally and socially, to \\"obey\\" their husbands.In 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.. In Iraq husbands have a legal right to \\"punish\\" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: \\"The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom\\".in Yemen marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission. Various behaviours of women, such as refusing arranged marriages or having premarital sex, are seen in many parts of the world as justifying violence from family members, particularly parents.In Jordan, part of article 340 of the Penal Code states that \\"he who discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty.\\" Article 98 of the Penal Code is often cited alongside Article 340 in cases of honour killings. \\"Article 98 stipulates that a reduced sentence is applied to a person who kills another person in a 'fit of fury'\\".[name=\\"GP\\">] [name=\\"alertnet.org\\">] A 2010 survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre found that stoning as a punishment for adultery was supported by 82% of respondents in Egypt and Pakistan, 70% in Jordan, 56% Nigeria, 42% in Indonesia; the death penalty for people who leave the Muslim religion was supported by 86% of respondents in Jordan, 84% in Egypt and 76% in Pakistan; gender segregation in the workplace was supported by 85% of respondents in Pakistan, 54% in Egypt, 50% in Jordan. Some people argue that Western countries have worked hard and for a long time to achieve modern values, and they have the right to maintain these values, and protect them from threats. In 2007, Quebec premier Jean Charest said that Quebec had values such as equality of women and men and the separation between the state and religion and that \\"These values are fundamental. They cannot be the object of any accommodation. They cannot be subordinated to any other principle.\\" (see reasonable accommodation). In recent years, several high-profile cases of honour killings, forced marriages and female genital mutilation among immigrant communities in Canada, the US and Europe have reignited the debate on immigration and integration. LGBT rights are another issue of controversy in relation to immigration, because homosexuality is in many parts of the world illegal and widely disapproved by society, and in some places it is even punishable by death (see sodomy laws and LGBT rights by country or territory). Some countries, such as the Netherlands, have adopted policies which explain to immigrants that they have to accept LGBT rights if they want to move to the country. By country The Commitment to Development Index ranks 22 of the world's richest countries on their immigration policies and openness to migrants and refugees from the poorest nations.

In Israel only Jewish immigrants automatically acquire Israeli citizenship. Jewish immigration to Palestine during the 19th century was promoted by the Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl in the late 19th century following the publication of \\"Der Judenstaat\\". His Zionist movement sought to encourage Jewish migration, or immigration, to Palestine. Its proponents regard its aim as self-determination for the Jewish people. The percentage of world Jewry living in the former Mandatory Palestine has steadily grown from 25,000 since the movement came into existence. Today about 40% of the world's Jews live in Israel, more than in any other country. The Israeli Law of Return, passed in 1950, gives those born Jews (having a Jewish mother or grandmother), those with Jewish ancestry (having a Jewish father or grandfather) and converts to Judaism (Orthodox, Reform, or Conservative denominations‚Äînot secular‚Äîthough Reform and Conservative conversions must take place outside the state, similar to civil marriages) the right to immigrate to Israel. A 1970 amendment, extended immigration rights to \\"a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew\\". Over a million Jews from the former Soviet Union have immigrated to Israel since the 1990s, and large numbers of Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to the country in Operation Moses. In the year 1991, Israel helped 14,000 Ethiopian immigrants arrive in operation Solomon. There were 35,638 African migrants living in Israel in 2011.\\"Danny Danon: Send African migrants to Australia\\". Jerusalem Post. 30 June 2011. Nearly 69,000 non-Jewish African migrants have entered Israel in recent years. Japan Japan's population is very ethnically homogeneous due to restrictions on immigration. To help cope with a labor shortage, Japan allowed additional immigrants of Japanese ancestry into the country in the early 1990s. According to Japanese immigration centre, the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased, and the number of foreign residents (including permanent residents, but excluding illegal immigrants and short-term visitors such as foreign nationals staying less than 90 days in Japan) was more than 2.2 million in 2008. The biggest groups are Koreans (both south and north), Chinese (including China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau nationalities), and Brazilians. Most of the Brazilians in Japan have Japanese ancestry due to the huge Japanese immigration to Brazil in the first decades of the 20th century. Immediately after World War II, most Koreans in Japan were illegal immigrants who escaped from civil war on the Korean Peninsula.23 Session of the National Diet, Committee on judicial affairs Japan accepted 8,646 persons as naturalised citizens in 2013, down from 10,622 the previous year. The definition of \\"ethnic groups\\" used in Japanese statistics is different from that used in North American or some Western European statistics. For example, the United Kingdom Census asks about its citizens' \\"ethnic or racial background\\". The Japanese Statistics Bureau does not ask this question. Since the Japanese census asks about nationality rather than ethnicity, naturalised Japanese citizens and Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic backgrounds are considered simply to be Japanese in the population of Japan. According to the Japanese Association for Refugees, the number of refugees who applied to live in Japan has rapidly increased since 2006, and there were more than a thousand applications in 2008. Japan's refugee policy has been criticised because the number of refugees accepted into Japan is small compared to countries such as Sweden and the United States. In 2013, Japan accepted only six of 3,777 persons who applied for refugee status. =Africa= Morocco Morocco is home to more than 46,000 sub-Saharan African immigrants.\\"At Europe's Door: Black African Migrants Trapped In Hellish Limbo in Morocco\\". International Business Times. 12 September 2013 Most of the foreign residents are French or Spanish. Prior to independence, Morocco was home to half a million Europeans.De Azevedo, Raimondo Cagiano (1994) Migration and development co- operation.. Council of Europe. p. 25. . =Europe= According to Eurostat, 47.3 million people lived in the EU in 2010, who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad , Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011. Some EU member states are currently receiving large-scale immigration: for instance Spain, where the economy has created more than half of all new jobs in the EU over the past five years. The EU, in 2005, had an overall net gain from international migration of +1.8 million people. This accounts for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth in 2005. In 2004, total 140,033 people immigrated to France. Of them, 90,250 were from Africa and 13,710 from Europe. In 2005, immigration fell slightly to 135,890. British emigration towards Southern Europe is of special relevance. Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Spain. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany, but the British case is of special interest due to its magnitude. The British authorities estimate that the British population in Spain at 700,000. Mid- and long term EU demographics indicate a shortage of skilled laborers on a scale that would endanger economic growth and the stability of numerous industries. For this reason the European Union launched an initiative called the EU Blue Card, In 2009. The EU Blue Card is initially a temporary residence and work permit. It will offer holders the opportunity to apply for a permanent resident permit after working on an EU Blue Card for two to five years uninterrupted, depending on individual member state regulations. Italy Immigrants to Europe have entered by boat to the Italian island of Lampedusa Italy now has an estimated 4 million to 4.5 million immigrants ‚Äî about 8 percent of the population. Since the expansion of the European Union, the most recent wave of migration has been from surrounding European nations, particularly Central Europe, and increasingly Asia, replacing North Africa as the major immigration area. Some 997,000 Romanians are officially registered as living in Italy, replacing Albanians (590,000) and Moroccans (455,000) as the largest ethnic minority group, but independent estimates put the actual number of Romanians at double that figure or perhaps even more. Other immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe are Ukrainians (260,000), Polish (120,000), Moldovans (190 000) Macedonians (100,000), Serbs (75,000), Bulgarians (124,000), Bosnians (40,000), Russians (50,000), Croatians (25,000), Slovaks (12,000), Hungarians (12,000). As of 2009, the foreign born population origin of Italy was subdivided as follows: Europe (53.5%), Africa (22.3%), Asia (15.8%), the Americas (8.1%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of foreign born population is largely uneven in Italy: 80% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 20% live in the southern half of the peninsula. In 2008, net immigration to Italy was 47,000.

The European and Pakistani immigrants are mainly labor immigrants while many other immigrants from outside Europe have come as asylum seekers or family members to such. Portugal Portugal, long a country of emigration, that have created big Portuguese communities in France, USA and Brazil has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the former colonies; by the end of 2003, legal immigrants represented about 4% of the population, and the largest communities were from Cape Verde, Brazil, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, UK, Spain, China and Ukraine. Spain As of 2010, there were over 6 million foreign-born residents in Spain, corresponding to 14% of the total population. Of these, 4.1 million (8.9% of the total population) were born outside the European Union and 2.3 million (5.1%) were born in another EU Member State.6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are , Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011. Spain is the most popular European destination for Britons living outside the UK. According to residence permit data for 2005, about 500,000 Moroccans, 500,000 Ecuadorians, more than 200,000 Romanians, and 260,000 Colombians lived in Spain. In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people. As a result of the Spanish financial crisis net migration trends reversed and in 2011 more people left Spain than immigrated with 507,740 leaving Spain and only 457,650 arriving.Americas Quarterly, Migration: Spain's Reverse Flows, BY Aurora Garc√≠a Ballesteros and Beatriz Cristina Jim√©nez Blasco, http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/migration-spains-reverse- flows Sweden Swedish politician Nyamko Sabuni was born in Burundi and immigrated to Sweden in 1981. As the Swedish government does not base any statistics on ethnicity, there are no exact numbers on the total number of people of immigrant background in Sweden. As of 2010, 1.33 million people or 14.3% of the inhabitants in Sweden were foreign-born. Sweden has been transformed from a nation of emigration ending after World War I to a nation of immigration from World War II onwards. In 2009, immigration reached its highest level since records began with 102,280 people emigrating to Sweden. In 2010, 32,000 people applied for asylum to Sweden, a 25% increase from 2009, the highest amount in Swedish history. In 2009, Sweden had the fourth largest number of asylum applications in the EU and the largest number per capita after Cyprus and Malta.Statistics Sweden. Befolkningsutveckling; f√∂dda, d√∂da, in- och utvandring, gifta, skilda 1749‚Äì2007 Immigrants in Sweden are mostly concentrated in the urban areas of Svealand and G√∂taland and the five largest foreign born populations in Sweden come from Finland, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Poland and Iran. According to a publication by Mete Feridun in the peer-reviewed Journal of Developing Areas published by the Tennessee State University, immigration has a statistically significant causal impact on economic growth in Sweden.Feridun, Mete (2007) Immigration, income and unemployment: an application of the bounds testing approach to cointegration. The Journal of Developing Areas, 41 (1). pp. 37-49. ISSN 1548-2278 (doi:10.1353/jda.2008.0014) Switzerland As of 2014, 23.4% of Switzerland's population are foreign born (with nearly 40% from Germany). Since the 1970s Switzerland's foreign born population has remained over 15% of the total population. Switzerland and Australia are the two countries with the highest proportion of immigrants in the world. In 2010, Swiss voters approved the deportation of criminal foreigners and in February 2014, the federal popular initiative \\"against mass immigration\\" was approved by 50.3% of voters. The referendum aims to reduce immigration through quotas and limits the freedom of movement between Switzerland and the European Union. In 2006 the United Nations special rapporteur on racism, Doudou Di√®ne, observed that Switzerland suffers from racism, discrimination and xenophobia and that Swiss authorities do not view these issues as serious problems. United Kingdom In 2007, net immigration to the UK was 237,000, a rise of 46,000 on 2006. In 2004, the number of people who became British citizens rose to a record 140,795‚Äîa rise of 12% on the previous year. This number had risen dramatically since 2000. In the 2001 Census, citizens from the Republic of Ireland were the largest foreign born group and have been for the last 200 years. This figure does not include those from Northern Ireland located since it is part of the United Kingdom. Those of Irish ancestry number roughly 6 million from first, second and third generation. The overwhelming majority of new citizens come from Asia (40%) and Africa (32%), the largest three groups being people from Pakistan, India and Somalia. In 2011, an estimated 589,000 migrants arrived to live in the UK for at least a year, most of the migrants were people from Asia (particularly the Indian subcontinent) and Africa, while 338,000 people emigrated from the UK for a year or more. Following Poland's entry into the EU in May 2004 it was estimated that by the start of 2007, 375,000 Poles had registered to work in the UK, although the total Polish population in the UK was believed to be 500,000. Many Poles work in seasonal occupations and a large number are likely to move back and forth over time. Some migrants left after the world economic crisis of 2008. In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country. the UK Immigration Minister was Damian Green, who has since been replaced by Mark Harper. The British Asian (South Asian) population has increased from 2.2 million in 2001 to over 4.2 million in 2011, while the Black British community has increased from 1.1 million in 2001 to nearly 1.9 million in 2011. Between 2001 and 2009, this was part of a general trend seeing a drop in white British people by 36,000 and a concurrent rise in non- white British people from 6.64 million to 9.13 million, including Chinese, Pakistani, mixed white and black Caribbean, black African, Australian, Canadian and European immigrants.Population growth of last decade driven by non-white British.

Over 200,000 undocumented Central American migrants were deported in 2005 alone.\\"Mexico: Caught Between the United States and Central America\\". By Manuel √Ångel Castillo, El Colegio de M√©xico. In a 2010 news story, USA Today reported, \\"... Mexico's Arizona-style law requires local police to check IDs. And Mexican police freely engage in racial profiling and routinely harass Central American migrants, say immigration activists.\\" After the United States returned to a more closed border, immigration has been more difficult than ever for Mexican residents hoping to migrate. Mexico is the leading country of migrants to the U.S.. A Mexican Repatriation program was founded by the United States government to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico. However, the program was not found successful and many immigrants were deported against their will. In 2010, there was a total of 139,120 legal immigrants who migrated to the United States. This put Mexico as the top country for emigration.Immigration to the United States In subsequent years China and India have surpassed Mexico as the top sources of immigrants to the United States, and since 2009 there has been a net decline in the number of Mexicans living in the US. Canada Chinatown in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, 2009. , Canada's immigration target is to accept between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents per year in three categories: skilled workers, people with family members already in the country, and humanitarian cases. In 2001, 250,640 people immigrated to Canada. Newcomers settle mostly in the major urban areas of Toronto and Vancouver. Since the 1990s, the majority of Canada's immigrants have come from Asia. The leading emigrating countries to Canada are China, Philippines and India. India was the third largest source country for immigration to Canada in 2012, with 28,889 permanent residents admitted. This represents an increase of almost 15 percent since 2004. In 2010, a record 280,636 people immigrated to Canada. Accusing a person of racism in Canada is usually considered a serious slur. Political parties in Canada are now cautious about criticising the level of immigration, because, as noted by The Globe and Mail, \\"in the early 1990s, the old Reform Party was branded 'racist' for suggesting that immigration levels be lowered from 250,000 to 150,000.\\" United States Naturalisation ceremony in New York City, 1930 Historians estimate that fewer than 1 million immigrants came to the United States from Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. Around 350,000 came from England between 1600 and 1699, and 80,000 more between 1700 and 1775. In addition, between the 17th and 19th centuries, an estimated 645,000 Africans were brought to what is now the United States. In the early years of the United States, immigration was fewer than 8,000 people a year. After 1820, immigration gradually increased. From 1850 to 1930, the foreign born population of the United States increased from 2.2 million to 14.2 million. The highest percentage of foreign born people in the United States was found in this period, with the peak in 1890 at 14.7% (compared to 13% in 2009). During this time, the lower costs of Atlantic Ocean travel in time and fare made it more advantageous for immigrants to move to the U.S. than in years prior. From 1880 to 1924, over 25 million Europeans migrated to the United States, mainly economic migrants. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act meanwhile suppressed immigration from East Asia, while the Emergency Quota Act, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924, restricted immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe.\\"Old fears over new faces\\", The Seattle Times, 21 September 2006 German immigrant family in the United States, 1930 Cesar Chavez speaking at a 1974 United Farm Workers rally in California. The UFW during Chavez's tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Following this time period, immigration fell because in 1924 Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which favoured immigrant source countries that already had many immigrants in the U.S. by 1890. Immigration patterns of the 1930s were dominated by the Great Depression, and in the early 1930s, more people emigrated from the United States than immigrated to it. Immigration continued to fall throughout the 1940s and 1950s, but it increased again afterwards. Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border in Arizona.

The Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965 (the Hart-Cellar Act) removed quotas on large segments of the immigration flow and legal immigration to the U.S. surged. In 2006, the number of immigrants totaled record 37.5 million. After 2000, immigration to the United States numbered approximately 1,000,000 per year. Nearly 8 million people immigrated to the United States from 2000 to 2005. Almost half entered illegally. In 2006, 1.27 million immigrants were granted legal residence. Mexico has been the leading source of new U.S. residents for over two decades; and since 1998, China, India and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year. The U.S. has often been called the \\"melting pot\\" (derived from Carl N. Degler, a historian, author of Out of Our Past), a name derived from United States' rich tradition of immigrants coming to the US looking for something better and having their cultures melded and incorporated into the fabric of the country. Appointed by President Clinton, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended in 1997 that legal immigration be reduced to about 550,000 a year. Since 11 September 2001, the politics of immigration has become an extremely hot issue. It was a central topic of the 2008 election cycle. U.S. immigration law distinguishes between \\"immigrants\\" who become lawful permanent residents and \\"nonimmigrants\\" who may remain lawfully in the U.S. for years, but who do not obtain permanent resident status. Since World War II, more refugees have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and more than two million refugees have arrived in the U.S. since 1980. Of the top ten countries accepting resettled refugees in 2006, the United States accepted more than twice as much as the next nine countries combined. One econometrics report in 2010 by analyst Kusum Mundra suggested that immigration positively affected bilateral trade when the U.S. had a networked community of immigrants, but that the trade benefit was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture. The table above does not include the years 2011 and 2012. The number of \\"immigrant\\" visas available each year is set by Congress. Nationals of countries that do not historically send many immigrants to the United States are eligible to apply for the Diversity Visa Lottery. According to Permanent residence (United States), in 2011 there were 2.7 million entries entered in the Diversity Visa Lottery. So far in 2012, there has been 19.6 million participants. The numbers increase tremendously each year. =Oceania= Australia Countries of birth of Australian estimated resident population (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006). The overall level of immigration to Australia has grown substantially during the last decade. Net overseas migration increased from 30,000 in 1993 to 118,000 in 2003-04. The largest components of immigration are the skilled migration and family re-union programs. The mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals by boat has generated great levels of controversy. During the 2004‚Äì05, total 123,424 people immigrated to Australia.

Nathaniel Bladen had an inheritance from both grandfathers: Robert Bladen and Nathaniel Birkhead - though Birkhead had objected to the marriage of his daughter Margaret to Bladen‚Äôs son John.Bladen v Watson C22/768/14, dated 1654 Bladen was the father of William Bladen - Attorney-General of Maryland andMaryland State Archives Colonel Martin BladenDictionary of National Biography Commissioner of the Board of Trade and Plantations, Grandfather of Thomas Bladen - Governor of Maryland and Admiral Hawke.'Martin Bladen: A Biography' by Karen Proudler Early life Nathaniel was born in 1642 just weeks after King Charles raised his Royal Standard at Nottingham to signal the start of the Civil War. His mother, Margaret Birkhead (c1622-42)Bladen v Watson C22/768/14 died at his birth and his father John had died between 1645-49.PROB 11/211 Mentioned in Will of Nathaniel Birkhead Orphaned as an infant, he was raised by his grandmother Elizabeth (Lacy) and then an Aunt Clarke (sister of his father John Bladen) and a guardian, Robert Wrightson (1629-1708) of Hemsworth. Wrightson supported Bladen‚Äôs education and training as a lawyerInner Temple Admissions Database and the two remained friends for many years with Wrightson purchasing parts of Bladen‚Äôs estate and the advowson of Hemsworth Church.  Marriage and Children He married Isabella FairfaxPaver's Marriage Licence 1668  daughter of Sir William Fairfax (soldier) of Steeton in Yorkshire and they had six surviving children: Isabella c1669-97, Catherine c1671-1713+, William 1673-1718, Frances c1675-1730, Elizabeth 1677-1748 and Colonel Martin Bladen 1680-1746. Nathaniel‚Äôs mother-in-law Dame Frances Fairfax (n√©e Challoner) brought a Chancery BillC10/142//2 Fairfax & Topham v Wrightson & Bladen in 1681 over the advowson of Hemsworth Church and his other inherited property which had been acquired by Wrightson. Steward to the Earl of Danby Nathaniel was employed by the Earl of Danby, his son Edward Osborne Viscount Latimer and Danby‚Äôs daughter Bridget, Countess of Plymouth over a period of twenty years from the mid-1660s to the late 1680s. During this time Danby rose from being Treasurer to Privy Councillor and Chief Minister until his enemies found a way to topple him from power. Danby was implicated in the Popish Plot and, as his Steward, Bladen was involved too; he regularly visited Danby when he was locked up in the Tower and liaised with those involved.MS 18984, 28049 ff24, ff25, ff26, ff40, ff196- British Library Manuscripts Steward to the Countess of Plymouth During the 1680s Bladen also acted as Steward to the Countess of Plymouth who was Danby‚Äôs recently widowed daughter whose husband had been Charles FitzCharles, 1st Earl of Plymouth, illegitimate son of King Charles II. After several years service, the Countess, in 1686, believed that Bladen had been embezzling from her and brought a Chancery Bill against himC9/117/25 Plymouth v Bladen which was non-suited. Steward to the Duchess of Buckingham In Nathaniel‚Äôs last role as Steward in a noble household, he was engaged by the Duchess of Buckingham who was his wife‚Äôs relation, being the daughter of 3rd Lord Fairfax. The estate of the widowed Duchess had been impoverished under her husband‚Äôs management and so Bladen could only look after that part of her estate not already in the hands of the courts and bailiffs. An annuity granted by the Duchess to Nathaniel and his wife was halted after a few years and became the subject of a dispute.Bladen v Ash C5/310/9 Nathaniel‚Äôs daughters brought action against Lady Ash of Twickenham, the prospective purchaser of the Duchess‚Äôs Nunappleton estate, for non-payment of the annuity. White Paper Making Bladen purchased Letters Patent in 1682 from Eustace Burnaby and Henry Million for the manufacture of white paper. He paid ¬£150 for Burnaby's 1675 Letters Patent and then, two years later, purchased more of Burnaby's interests (for a new invention or mill) for ¬£240. Bladen subsequently obtained Letters Patent for same.Bladen v Beresford TNA C 6/88/46, dated 1699 Since Bladen later stated himself to have an interest in Colnett Mill in Bucks, this is perhaps the same one he acquired from Burnaby. Colnett Mill in Wraysbury (east of Windsor) was situated on the Colne Brooke and had been used as a paper mill since 1605. Since the local government re- organisation of 1974 this area was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Windsor. Soon after the transactions were complete, Burnaby decided he wanted his Letters Patents and interests back from Bladen and offered him ¬£1,500. Burnaby appears to have been acting as an agent for Lady Theodosia Ivy and her land was put at his disposal to raise the sum. Ivy's land in Wapping Marsh was assigned to Bladen to cover the amount, indeed it probably exceeded the value needed and so Bladen gave over his interest in Colnett Mill to her. Bladen held a mortgage on Lady Ivy's lands and when she failed to pay interest, a third party took possession. Despite this, Lady Ivy left the same land in Wapping (Babsfield) to her relations in her Will, thereby leaving all parties in dispute for many years.

Instrumentation engineering is the science of the measurement and control of process variables within a production or manufacturing area.\\"Instrumentation \\", The Northern Alberta Institute of Technology., Retrieved 17 October 2012. Meanwhile, control engineering, also called control systems engineering, is the engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. Control engineers are responsible for the research, design, and development of control devices and systems, typically in manufacturing facilities and process plants. Control methods employ sensors to measure the output variable of the device and provide feedback to the controller so that it can make corrections toward desired performance. Automatic control manages a device without the need of human inputs for correction, such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed. Control systems engineering activities are multi-disciplinary in nature. They focus on the implementation of control systems, mainly derived by mathematical modeling. Because instrumentation and control play a significant role in gathering information from a system and changing its parameters, they are a key part of control loops.  As profession  High demand for engineering professionals is found in fields associated with process automation. Specializations include industrial instrumentation, system dynamics, process control, and control systems. Additionally, technological knowledge, particularly in computer systems, is essential to the job of an instrumentation and control engineer; important technology-related topics include human‚Äìcomputer interaction, programmable logic controllers, and SCADA.

Description  The Wedung is a short and broad machete (Bendho). Its blade has a straight back and an S-shape edge. It may be made of smooth iron, but pamor forge work also occurs. The back is sometimes sharpened along 1/3 of its length from the point. The blade's base is straight and stands at an angle of 90 degrees to the back. This base usually has decoration shaped as filed-out indentations or small teeth (greneng). A round 'eye' or hole (kembang kacang) is sometimes found. Furthermore, the base may be decorated with inlay work and representations of mythical dragon (naga), leaf and floral motifs. The tang (peksi) is made out of the blade's thick back rim. Between the spike and the blade, a pentagonal segment (metok or integral bolster) is forged. The short hilt, which is pentagonal on Java, forms as it were, an extension of the metok. The hilt is usually made of wood, but other materials such as animal tooth are also found. Its smooth upper part is flattened. The Wedung on Bali has narrower shape and is usually more lavishly decorated. On the rear near the base a lengthy decoration is sometimes added. The hilt and the metok of the Balinese Wedung are instead of pentagonal, usually round in cross-section. It is sometimes chiselled. The wooden scabbard usually follows the blade's shape, but may have a rectangular lower part. Its mouth has a broadened rim all around. At the rear side the scabbard has a large horn hook shaped (sangkletan) resembling a shoe-horn, with which the Wedung can be hitched onto the belt. This hook is attached to the scabbard by means of strips of horn, rattan or metal. On expensive examples the scabbard sometimes has one or two round or comma-shaped golden or silver mounts.  Culture  The Wedung is a peculiar weapon, in the shape of a chopper, worn on occasions of the state by all chiefs when in the presence of the sovereign. It is carried in the palace (kraton) as a symbol of servitude to the sultan for performing tasks such as cutting of shrubs or even the most humble work such as grass cutting. It is therefore, no longer a real weapon but rather a work-tool carried on the left hip and used as personal decoration. Unlike the Keris which is only meant for men, the Wedung can be worn by both men and women in the kraton.

Following low key releases by Uhersky Brod and Nightjar, the label's first major release was Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing with Tongues by the Edinburgh-based Meursault in 2009, the success of which Young credits with forcing him 'to set up a proper record label'. The album was rated by cultural magazine The Skinny as the 16th best Scottish album of the 2000-2010 decade.

The book is the follow-up to Killing Kennedy, Killing Lincoln, and Killing Jesus and was published in September 2014 through Henry Holt and Company. Disputed theory O'Reilly suggests that Patton was poisoned while recovering from the automobile accident he endured on December 8, 1945, on the orders of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, ostensibly to prevent him from warning the United States about the imminent danger of the Soviet Union. \\"I think Stalin killed him,\\" O'Reilly told George Stephanopoulos on the ABC news program This Week. Media Matters for America reported that several historians found O'Reilly's theory highly implausible. Rick Atkinson, a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, told the progressive news organization that Patton died of complications following \\"a fender bender.\\" \\"You've got to look at what Patton's situation was,\\" said Carlo D'Este, the author of Patton: A Genius for War. \\"He was a quadriplegic, he was going to die anyway, he was totally immobilized, he couldn't move. What is the point of assassinating him and where did Stalin come from anyway? Sure, somebody could have snuck in the hospital, but why would you bother? You need to verify facts. That certainly raises a red flag with me.\\" Patton‚Äôs grandson, Robert Patton, also rejected the suggestion of assassination. \\"The theory is he either died naturally or from a blood clot,\\" he said. You're paralyzed, and this is what happens. Reception Writing in The Washington Post, Richard Cohen criticized the book's \\"chaotic structure\\" and \\"considerable padding,\\" calling the work a \\"clunky hagiography.\\" Cohen was especially critical of O'Reilly's \\"repellent admiration\\" for Patton in light of his demonstrable anti-Semitism. In The New Republic, James Wolcott dismissed the book as O'Reilly's \\"latest papier-m√¢ch√© exercise in necrobiography.\\" Patton biographer and documentary filmmaker Robert Orlando described Killing Patton and O'Reilly's \\"Killing\\" series as \\"not about new or penetrating discovery, but the same ol' same ol' only through this greatly successful marketer and his hired writer‚Äîa scheduled feeding for an audience already 'on the farm.'\\" By contrast, Wes Vernon wrote in The Washington Times that \\"Killing Patton is rich in blow-by-blow accounts of some of the most significant battles of World War II, as well as of many off-battlefield lives of its primary movers whose personalities virtually come to life in this well-crafted narrative.\\" Sales On his June 24, 2015 segment of The O'Reilly Factor, O'Reilly claimed that Killing Patton was \\"the bestselling tome ... in 2014.\\" Publishers Weekly subsequently pointed out that according to Nielsen BookScan, Killing Patton \\"was the fifth bestselling print book of 2014, behind The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul by Jeff Kinney, and Divergent and Insurgent by Veronica Roth.\\" O'Reilly's previous book, Killing Lincoln, was riddled with factual inaccuracies and other errors, such that the Ford's Theater bookstore declined to offer it for sale.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-killing-lincoln- errors_n_1091168 Scrapped adaptation On November 24, 2015, National Geographic Channel and Scott Free Productions jointly announced the television adaptation of Killing Patton. Anthony Peckham was attached to write the four- hour teleplay. Following O'Reilly's departure from Fox News in April 2017, it was announced the film was still in development with a scheduled release in 2019. However, in June 2017, National Geographic announced the cancellation of the project. The network stated that \\"It was in development for a couple of years, and it was a difficult project to crack creatively\\" and that \\"Like most projects in development, it didn't go the distance, so we passed on it.\\" This is the first of O'Reilly's projects that National Geographic has passed on.

The United States film business is highly competitive and counterprogramming is a studio's way to maximize revenue. In 2003, a number of successes by specialty films during the summer season traditionally dominated by more commercial films inspired studios to release more specialty films in the summer as counterprogramming, rather than releasing them in the following autumn season. The strategy did not succeed because too many specialty films were scheduled for the summer of 2004 and competed with each other rather than the commercial films. Studios also engage in counterprogramming in response to major non-film events. Lionsgate distributed the film Warm Bodies in the United States on the weekend of , 2013, the same weekend as Super Bowl XLVII, to cater to the female teen demographic. The film grossed on its opening weekend and ranked first at the box office. The counterprogramming approach to the Super Bowl had been employed prior to Warm Bodies; the most successful film opening on Super Bowl weekend was Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert in 2008 with . In 2012, Slates Jim Pagels reported that the year's film schedule in the United States lacked counterprogramming compared to previous years. Pagels said studios found counterprogramming riskier because films' second- weekend box office performances had steeper drops from their opening-weekend performances than in the past. He said, \\"Studios can't afford to suffer a slow start and make it up in later weeks.\\" The decrease in counterprogramming was also attributed to commercial films catering to more demographics, particularly the female demographic. The year's The Dark Knight Rises from Warner Bros. had no competition on its opening weekend since no rival studio wanted to compete with the film.

She is International Director of the technology transfer organisation PraxisUnico and a Visiting Professor at Imperial College London. With expertise in the field of epigenetics and in technology transfer, she promotes the movement of scientists between academia and industry, lecturing often to school students and early career scientists. Carey writes books and articles for a scientifically interested general audience. She is the author of The Epigenetics Revolution and Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome which explore advances in the field of epigenetics and their implications for medicine. She edited Epigenetics for Drug Discovery for the Royal Society of Chemistry's Drug Discovery Series.  Education and career  Carey attended state schools. She first attended the University of Edinburgh to study veterinary medicine. Having limited aptitude for the course and reacting badly to animal fur she left veterinary studies. She then worked for five years in the Metropolitan Police forensic science laboratory as a forensic scientist. After studying for her degree in immunology part-time, Carey decided to continue academic research and returned to the University of Edinburgh to pursue doctoral studies. Carey was awarded her Doctorate (PhD) by research thesis on the virology of the maedi-visna virus which affects sheep, in 1993. Her post-doctoral research was in the field of human genetics at the Department of Anatomy, Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School after which she became a Lecturer, and then Senior Lecturer, in Molecular Biology at Imperial College London, School of Medicine. In 2001 she left academia to work in industry although since 2013 she has been a Visiting Professor in the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London in conjunction with her professional career. Carey was Director of Molecular Biology at Vernalis from 2001 until 2004. She then held positions as Head of Biology at TopoTarget from 2004 to 2006 and Scientific Director at CellCentric from 2006 to May 2011. From May 2011 until July 2014 she was Senior Director in External Research and Development Innovation at Pfizer where she focused on identifying new collaborative opportunities in the field of epigenetics. She has been International Director at PraxisUnico since July 2014. Carey was a Member of the Bioscience for Industry Strategy Advisory Panel of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) from 2011 to 2015; a Member of the Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board of the Medical Research Council (MRC) from 2011 to 2015 and a Scientific Steering Committee member for the MRC Epigenetics workshop in 2015. Carey's expertise has expanded from biology to include communication and training. She is a Registered Technology Transfer Professional (RTTP). Her achievements include delivering training at Imperial College School of Medicine and the Royal College of Surgeons (UK and Ireland). She is active in promoting movement of scientists between academia and industry and often discusses choices with early career scientists.  Publications  Carey's books and lectures explain developments in epigenetics to a scientifically interested general audience. Carey has published over 30 peer-reviewed papers on epigenetics and other aspects of biology. She also writes in the popular press examining popular culture and media from a scientific viewpoint. = The Epigenetics Revolution: How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease, and Inheritance = Carey suggests that Audrey Hepburn's slight figure may be the product of epigenetic changes from wartime deprivation. Her first book, The Epigenetics Revolution, describes how epigenetic modifications allow the same DNA to express different characteristics; she likens DNA to a script for a play rather than a template. The same script can produce different productions of the play. She used the example of Audrey Hepburn's slight figure to explain the possible impacts of epigenetics. Hepburn's figure was a result of lifelong illnesses brought on by her deprivation during the Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì45 during World War II. Carey's book says we aren't simply born with pre-set genes and the way genes function can be altered 'epigenetically' by our environments or diets. These changes can subsequently impact future generations. The book discusses controversies which are a part of this rapidly developing field and explores explanations other than epigenetics for some findings. Peter Forbes of The Guardian wrote that while the book does not simplify scientific terminology for the general reader, it \\"is the first to set out the epigenetics stall for the general reader, and anyone seriously interested in who we are and how we function should read this book\\". Other reviewers also found the book \\"a bit jargon heavy\\", while some felt this was \\"not so much her fault as the nature of biology\\". Alexander Badyaev writes that \\"you cannot help but admire the author who is so fluent in such a great diversity of topics\\". = Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome = Carey's second book, Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome, examines developments in the study of junk DNA, or noncoding DNA. DNA that doesn't code for proteins has been dismissed as nonfunctional until recently. She explains the \\"most fundamental reason for the shift in emphasis is the sheer volume of junk DNA that our cells contain. One of the biggest shocks when the human genome sequence was completed in 2001 was the discovery that over 98 per cent of the DNA in a human is junk. It doesn't code for any proteins.\\" Carey describes how this Junk DNA > maintains the integrity of our chromosomes; regulates the ways the protein- > coding genes are expressed; influences how we age and generally introduces > incredible degrees of subtlety and flexibility into how we use the > relatively small numbers of genes that code for proteins ... [and] > contributes to all sorts of situations, from the correct control of gene > expression in female cells to the regulation of pathways that drive cancer. > From Ernest Hemingway's mutant cat to exoneration of the innocent through > DNA fingerprinting, junk DNA impacts on an astonishing range of biological > phenomena. The book uses analogy to explain molecular phenomena. Although there is some criticism that the book's coverage is \\"too comprehensive for the general reader\\" and \\"lacks an overarching, compelling narrative to carry readers through\\", reviewer Linda Geddes called it \\"a cutting-edge, exhaustive guide to the rapidly changing, ever-more mysterious genome.\\" It is recommended for \\"any nonspecialist who would like a captivating, thorough, and up-to-date introduction...[to] the bigger picture of our wonderful and messy genome.\\" Carey describes the controversy and politics around this field: \\"At one extreme we have scientists claiming experimental proof is lacking to support sometimes sweeping claims. At the other are those who feel there is a whole generation of scientists (if not more) trapped in an outdated model and unable to see or understand the new order.\\" While some reviewers have criticised her style, a few also attack her science. =Epigenetics for Drug Discovery= Edited by Carey, Epigenetics for Drug Discovery, is \\"written by the leading researchers in this field. It is intended as a guide for medicinal chemists or scientists in other fields wishing to know more.\\" This book examines the field of epigenetics, its possible applications to medicine and the challenges in using the research safely and efficaciously. It includes for example: a chapter by Karl P. Nightingale which defines epigenetics and explains why it matters; a chapter by Tom D. Heightman and Michael McCullar which focuses \\"on the biochemical mechanisms controlling DNA methylation, consequences of aberrant DNA methylation in complex chronic diseases, existing modulators of DNA methylation used in the clinic, and opportunities for new drugs targeting this central epigenetic mechanism\\" and a chapter titled \\"Progress in Targeting Epigenetic Readers\\" by Chun-Wa Chung. This book is part of the Royal Society of Chemistry's Drug Discovery Series which includes over fifty volumes published since 2010 in the fields of drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. \\"Providing comprehensive coverage of this important and far-reaching area, the books encourage learning in a range of different topics and provide valuable reference for scientists working outside their own areas of expertise.\\" =Hacking the Code of Life: How Gene Editing Will Rewrite Our Futures (2019)= This book discusses a new technique for genetic modification called CRISPR. This system allows the scientists to precisely and easily manipulate the genes of any living organism in a short period of time. The book further discusses the ethical limitations in the implementation of these methods on human beings. Carey gives a snapshot of the technology that is possibly going to change the future of gene editing.

Education  Born in Ohio, Peets received an undergraduate degree from Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, in 1912 and a master's degree in landscape architecture from Harvard University in 1915. After graduation, he taught horticulture at Harvard.Arnold R. Alanen, ‚ÄúElbert Peets‚Äù in ‚ÄúPioneers of American Landscape Design‚Äù, Charles A. Birnbaum and Robin Karson, eds. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000.  Career  Peets worked primarily in Wisconsin, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C. In 1916 he began a collaboration with the German planner and critic Werner Hegemann and in 1922 they published a seminal work of city planning, ‚ÄúThe American Vitruvius: An Architect‚Äôs Handbook of Civic Art‚Äù. Peets served as an engineer planner with the Army during World War I. In 1917 he won Harvard‚Äôs Charles Eliot Travelling Fellowship and with these funds he traveled throughout Europe in 1920. After Hegemann returned to Europe in 1921, Peets practiced on his own for the next decade, continuing to write about topics ranging from Baroque cities to tree care.See Alanen. During the Great Depression, Peets joined the U.S. Farm Resettlement Administration (1935‚Äì38) and served as chief of the site planning section for the U.S. Housing Authority until 1944. After World War II he worked as a consultant to such clients as the National Capital Planning Commission. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1950 to 1958 and taught at Harvard and Yale Universities between 1950 and 1960. His planning projects include several with Hegemann, among them the new towns of Kohler, Washington Highlands Historic District in Wauwatosa, and Lake Forest, Wisconsin; Wyomissing Park, Pennsylvania; Park Forest, Illinois; Bannockburn, Maryland; and Greendale, Wisconsin, one of three greenbelt cities developed by the Resettlement Administration in the 1930s. Peets designed Greendale around a central green space that terminated in a town hall based on the Governor‚Äôs Palace, Williamsburg, Virginia.  Writings  In his writings Peets carefully analyzed American and European city plans, the development of spatial enclosures and long vistas, the London of Christopher Wren and the Paris of Baron Haussmann, and he adapted what he learned for his own town plans. He conducted particularly close study of the 1791 L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C., creating a verbal and pictorial image of how the city would have appeared if developed as Pierre Charles L'Enfant intended. He examined which of L'Enfant's planned effects had been lost through subsequent development, including implementation of the 1901 Senate Park Commission Plan (McMillan Plan)‚Äîfor example, the blocking of many visual axes to the Washington Monument. In his essay on Peets in \\"Pioneers of American Landscape Design\\", Arnold R. Alanen describes him as \\"iconoclastic,\\" and indeed in his writings Peets questioned such revered American institutions as picturesque landscape gardening, Central Park, and the Lincoln Memorial for what he saw as their conventionality or inappropriateness.

Santana, Gregory Erickson, Religion and Popular Culture: Rescripting the Sacred (London: McFarland, 2008), , p. 4. between the earliest times of human occupation of what is now Scotland and the present day. Very little is known about religion in Scotland before the arrival of Christianity. It is generally presumed to have resembled Celtic polytheism and there is evidence of the worship of spirits and wells. The Christianisation of Scotland was carried out by Irish- Scots missionaries, and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England, from the sixth century. Elements of paganism survived into the Christian era. Most early evidence of religious practice is heavily biased towards monastic life. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials, prayed for the dead and offered sermons. The church dictated in moral and legal matters and impinged on other elements of everyday life through its rules on fasting, diet, the slaughter of animals and rules on purity and ritual cleansing. One of the main features of Medieval Scotland was the Cult of Saints, with shrines devoted to local and national figures, including St Andrew, and the establishment of pilgrimage routes. Scots also played a major role in the Crusades. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in the late medieval period. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later fifteenth century. As the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within parish churches grew rapidly. New \\"international\\" cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century. Heresy, in the form of Lollardry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early fifteenth century, but did not achieve a significant following. The Reformation, carried out in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily influenced by Calvinism, amounted to a revolution in religious practice. Sermons were now the focus of worship. The Witchcraft Act 1563 made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes. There were major series of trials in 1590‚Äì91, 1597, 1628‚Äì31, 1649‚Äì50 and 1661‚Äì62. Prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women and modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed across the whole period. Scottish Protestantism in the seventeenth century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the mid-seventeenth century Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to maintain until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century with the adoption of the Westminster Directory in 1643. The seventeenth century saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline, with kirk sessions able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. Kirk sessions also had an administrative burden in the system of poor relief and a major role in education. In the eighteenth century there were a series of reforms in church music. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted at most once a year, sometimes in outdoor holy fairs. Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. Attempts to supplement the parish system included Sunday schools. By the 1830s and 1840s these had widened to include mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. After the Great Disruption in 1843, the control of relief was removed from the church and given to parochial boards. The temperance movement was imported from America and by 1850 it had become a central theme in the missionary campaign to the working classes. Church attendance in all denominations declined after World War I. It increased in the 1950s as a result of revivalist preaching campaigns, particularly the 1955 tour by Billy Graham, and returned to almost pre-war levels. From this point there was a steady decline that accelerated in the 1960s. Sectarianism became a serious problem in the twentieth century. This was most marked in Glasgow in the traditionally Roman Catholic team, Celtic, and the traditionally Protestant team, Rangers. Relations between Scotland's churches steadily improved during the second half of the twentieth century and there were several initiatives for cooperation, recognition and union. The foundation of the ecumenical Iona Community in 1938 led to a highly influential form of music, which was used across Britain and the US. The Dunblane consultations in 1961‚Äì69 resulted in the British \\"Hymn Explosion\\" of the 1960s, which produced multiple collections of new hymns. In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through immigration, including Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Other minority faiths include the Bah√°'√≠ Faith and small Neopagan groups. There are also various organisations which actively promote humanism and secularism. Pre-Christian religion The \\"Cernunnos\\" type antlered figure on the Gundestrup Cauldron found in Denmark Very little is known about religion in Scotland before the arrival of Christianity. The lack of native written sources among the Picts means that it can only be judged from parallels elsewhere, occasional surviving archaeological evidence and hostile accounts of later Christian writers. It is generally presumed to have resembled Celtic polytheism. The names of more than two hundred Celtic deities have been noted, some of which, like Lugh, The Dagda and The Morrigan, come from later Irish mythology, whilst others, like Teutatis, Taranis and Cernunnos, come from evidence from Gaul.B. Cunliffe, The Ancient Celts (Oxford, 1997), , p. 184. The Celtic pagans constructed temples and shrines to venerate these gods, something they did through votive offerings and performing sacrifices, possibly including human sacrifice. According to Greek and Roman accounts, in Gaul, Britain and Ireland, there was a priestly caste of \\"magico-religious specialists\\" known as the druids, although very little is definitely known about them.R. Hutton, Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain (Yale University Press, 2009), , p. 17. Irish legends about the origin of the Picts and stories from the life of St. Ninian, associate the Picts with druids. The Picts are also associated in Christian writing with \\"demon\\" worship and one story concerning St. Columba has him exorcising a demon from a well in Pictland, suggesting that the worship of well spirits was a feature of Pictish paganism. Roman mentions of the worship of the Goddess Minerva at wells, and a Pictish stone associated with a well near Dunvegan Castle on Skye, have been taken to support this case.P. Dunbavin, Picts and Ancient Britons: an Exploration of Pictish Origins (Third Millennium Publishing, 1998), , p. 41. Early Middle Ages Remains of a chapel on Eileach an Naoimh The Christianisation of Scotland was carried out by Irish- Scots missionaries and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England from the sixth century.R. A. Fletcher, The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity (University of California Press, 1999), , pp. 231‚Äì3. This movement is traditionally associated with the figures of St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba.R. A. Fletcher, The Barbarian Conversion: from Paganism to Christianity (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1999), , pp. 79‚Äì80.T. O. Clancy, \\"The real St Ninian\\", The Innes Review, 52 (2001). Elements of paganism survived into the Christian era. Sacred wells and springs became venerated as sites of pilgrimage. Most evidence of Christian practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From this can be seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the Mass. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. The church encouraged alms giving and hospitality. It also dictated in moral and legal matters, including marriage and inheritance. It also impinged on other elements of everyday life through its rules on fasting, diet, the slaughter of animals and rules on purity and ritual cleansing. Early local churches were widespread, but since they were largely made of wood,G. Markus, \\"Religious life: early medieval\\", in M.

Hume, Scotland's Best Churches (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 1. the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including cill, both, eccles and annat, but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials. Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings. Many of these were built by local lords for their tenants and followers, but often retaining a close relationship with monastic institutions.I. Maxwell, A History of Scotland's Masonry Construction in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , pp. 22‚Äì3. Viking raids began on monasteries like Iona and Lindisfarne began in the eighth century. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles eventually fell to the Norsemen.W. E. Burns, A Brief History of Great Britain (Infobase Publishing, 2009), , pp. 44‚Äì5. Although there is evidence of varying burial rites practised by Norse settlers in Scotland, such as grave goods found on Colonsay and Westray, there is little that enables a confirmation that the Norse gods were venerated prior to the reintroduction of Christianity.J. Jensen, \\"The Norse gods in Scotland\\" in A. Woolf, ed., Scandinavian Scotland ‚Äì Twenty Years After (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), pp. 52 and 58. The Odin Stone has been used as evidence of Odinic beliefs and practices but the derivation may well be from \\"oathing stone\\".J. Jensen, \\"The Norse gods in Scotland\\" in A. Woolf, ed., Scandinavian Scotland ‚Äì Twenty Years After (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), p. 54. A few Scandinavian poetic references suggest that Orcadian audiences understood elements of the Norse pantheon, although this is hardly conclusive proof of active beliefs.J. Jensen, \\"The Norse gods in Scotland\\" in A. Woolf, ed., Scandinavian Scotland ‚Äì Twenty Years After (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), pp. 54 and 59. Nonetheless, it is likely that pagan practices existed in early Scandinavian Scotland.J. Jensen, \\"The Norse gods in Scotland\\" in A. Woolf, ed., Scandinavian Scotland ‚Äì Twenty Years After (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), , p. 62. High Middle Ages The Monymusk Reliquary, or Brecbennoch, said to house the bones of Columba One of the main features of Medieval Scotland was the Cult of Saints. Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called St Faelan and St. Colman, and saints Findbar and Finan.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 64. Columba remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation was endowed by William I (r. 1165‚Äì1214) at Arbroath Abbey. His relics, contained in the Monymusk Reliquary, were handed over to the Abbot's care.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 52‚Äì3. Regional saints remained important to local identities. In Strathclyde the most important saint was St Kentigern, whose cult (under the pet name St. Mungo) became focused in Glasgow.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 46. In Lothian it was St Cuthbert, whose relics were carried across the Northumbria after Lindisfarne was sacked by the Vikings before being installed in Durham Cathedral.A. Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts in Northumbria in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2003), , p. 137. After his martyrdom around 1115, a cult emerged in Orkney, Shetland and northern Scotland around Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney.H. Antonsson, St. Magn√∫s of Orkney: A Scandinavian Martyr-Cult in Context (Leiden: Brill, 2007), . One of the most important cults in Scotland, that of St Andrew, was established on the east coast at Kilrymont by the Pictish kings as early as the eighth century.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 4th edn., 2005), , p. 11. The shrine, which from the twelfth century was said to have contained the relics of the saint brought to Scotland by Saint Regulus,B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 55. began to attract pilgrims from across Scotland, but also from England and further away. By the twelfth century the site at Kilrymont had become known simply as St. Andrews and it became increasingly associated with Scottish national identity and the royal family. The site was renewed as a focus for devotion with the patronage of Queen Margaret,M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , p. 76. who also became important after her canonisation in 1250 and after the ceremonial transfer of her remains to Dunfermline Abbey, as one of the most revered national saints. Pilgrimage was undertaken to local, national and international shrines for personal devotion, as penance imposed by a priest, or to seek cures for illness or infirmity.D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 252. Written sources and pilgrim badges found in Scotland, of clay, jet and pewter, indicate journeys undertaken to Scottish shrines and further afield.M. A.

The most visited pilgrimage sites in late medieval Christendom were Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago de Compostela, in Spain, but Scottish pilgrims also visited Amiens in France and Canterbury in England.K. Stevenson, Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424‚Äì1513 (Boydell Press, 2006), , p. 110. Scots also played a role in the Crusades. Crusading was preached by friars and special taxation was raised from the late twelfth century.J. Foggie, \\"Church institutions: medieval\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 80‚Äì2. A contingent of Scots took part in the First Crusade (1096‚Äì99). Significant numbers of Scots participated in the Egyptian crusades and the seventh (1248‚Äì54) and eighth crusades (1270), led by Louis IX of France. A later commentator indicated that many of these were ordinary Scotsmen. Many died of disease, including the leaders and Louis himself. This was the last great crusade, although the ideal remained a major concern of late medieval kings, including Robert I and James IV.A. Macquarrie, \\"Crusades\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 115‚Äì16. The Christian calendar incorporated elements of existing practice and dominated the social life of communities. Fairs were held at Whitsun and Martinmas, at which people traded, married, moved house and conducted other public business. The mid-Winter season of Yule involved two weeks of revels in which even the clergy joined in. The feast of Corpus Christi, focused on the body of Christ and held in June, grew in importance throughout the period. The central occasion of the Christian calendar was Easter. It was preceded by the 40 days of fasting of Lent, during which preachers urged full confession, which took place in church aisles to by priests and friars. It cumulated in Easter Sunday, when most parishioners received their annual communion. Late Middle Ages The Adoration of the Magi, a rare survival of pre-Reformation religious iconography from a house in Dundee Traditional Protestant historiography tended to stress the corruption and unpopularity of the late Medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated the ways in which it met the spiritual needs of different social groups.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 76‚Äì87.D. M. Palliser, The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600‚Äì1540 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 349‚Äì50. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in this period, with many religious houses keeping smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. The rate of new monastic endowments from the nobility also declined in the fifteenth century.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 246. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later fifteenth century, who, unlike the older monastic orders, placed an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of Observant Friars were organised as a Scottish province from 1467 and the older Franciscans and the Dominicans were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s. In most Scottish burghs, in contrast to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church, but as the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed to speed the passage of souls to Heaven, grew rapidly.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 254. The number of altars dedicated to saints, who could intercede in this process, also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50.P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 26‚Äì9. The number of saints celebrated in Scotland also proliferated, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New \\"international\\" cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus,C. Peters, Women in Early Modern Britain, 1450‚Äì1640 (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), , p. 147. but also St Joseph, St. Anne, the Three Kings and the Apostles, would become more significant in Scotland.D. Ditchburn, \\"The McRoberts Thesis and patterns of sanctity in late Medieval Scotland\\", in S. Boardman and E. Williamson, eds, The Cult of Saints and the Virgin Mary in Medieval Scotland (Woodbridge: Boydell & Brewer, 2010), , pp. 178‚Äì94. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows. Heresy, in the form of Lollardry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early fifteenth century. Lollards were followers of John Wycliffe (c. 1330‚Äì84) and later Jan Hus (c. 1369‚Äì1415), who called for reform of the Church and rejected its doctrine on the Eucharist. Despite evidence of a number of burnings of heretics and limited popular support for its anti-sacramental elements, it probably remained a small movement.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 257. There were also further attempts to differentiate Scottish liturgical practice from that in England, with a printing press established under royal patent in 1507 in order to replace the English Sarum Use for services. Sixteenth century The North Berwick Witches meet the Devil in the local kirkyard, from a contemporary pamphlet, Newes from Scotland The Reformation, carried out in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily influenced by Calvinism, amounted to a revolution in religious practice. It led to the abolition of auricular confession, the wafer in mass, which was no longer seen as a \\"work\\", Latin in services, prayers to Mary and the Saints and the doctrine of Purgatory. The interiors of churches were transformed, with the removal of the High Altar, altar rails, rood screens, choir stalls, side altars, statues and images of the saints. The colourful paintwork of the late Middle Ages was removed, with walls whitewashed to conceal murals. In place of all this were a plain table for communion, pews for the congregation, pulpits and lecterns for the sermons that were now the focus of worship. Printed sermons indicate that they could be as long as three hours. Until the 1590s most parishes were not served by a minister, but by readers, who could not preach or administer the sacraments. As a result, they might only hear a sermon once every two weeks and communion was usually administered once a year on Easter Sunday.M. Lynch, \\"Religious life: 1560‚Äì1660\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 512‚Äì13. In the late Middle Ages there had been a handful of prosecutions for harm done through witchcraft, but the passing of the Witchcraft Act 1563 made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes.K. A. Edwards, \\"Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart Scotland\\", in K. Cartwright, A Companion to Tudor Literature Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2010), , p. 32. The first major series of trials under the new act were the North Berwick witch trials, beginning in 1589, in which James VI played a major part as \\"victim\\" and investigator.J. Keay and J. Keay, Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland (London: Harper Collins, 1994), , p. 556. He became interested in witchcraft and published a defence of witch-hunting in the Daemonologie in 1597, but he appears to have become increasingly sceptical and eventually took steps to limit prosecutions. An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people, mostly from the Scottish Lowlands, were tried for witchcraft in this period; a much higher rate than for neighbouring England. There were major series of trials in 1590‚Äì91, 1597, 1628‚Äì31, 1649‚Äì50 and 1661‚Äì62. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women and the hunt has been seen as a means of controlling women. Modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed across the whole period.S. J. Brown, \\"Religion and society to c. 1900\\", T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 81. Seventeenth century Killing Time\\" Scottish Protestantism in the seventeenth century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the early part of the century the Genevan translation was commonly used.G. D. Henderson, Religious Life in Seventeenth-Century Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), , pp. 1‚Äì4. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the seventeenth century.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 192‚Äì3. Many Bibles were large, illustrated and highly valuable objects. They often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination.G. D. Henderson, Religious Life in Seventeenth-Century Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), , p. 12. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out.G. D. Henderson, Religious Life in Seventeenth-Century Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), , p. 8. It was in the mid- seventeenth century that Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to maintain until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century. The adoption of the Westminster Directory in 1643 meant that the Scots adopted the English Puritan dislike of set forms of worship. The recitation of the Creed, Lord's Prayer, Ten Commandments and Doxology were abandoned in favour of the lengthy sermon of the lecture. The centrality of the sermon meant that services tended to have a didactic and wordy in character. The only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms.D. Murray, \\"Religious life: 1650‚Äì1750\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 513‚Äì4. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line and it was then repeated by the congregation. The seventeenth century saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte \\"Introduction\\" in R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte, eds, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 30. Public occasions were treated with mistrust and from the later seventeenth century there were efforts by kirk sessions to stamp out activities such as well-dressing, bonfires, guising, penny weddings and dancing.R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte \\"Introduction\\" in R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte, eds, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 34. Kirk sessions also had an administrative burden in the system of poor relief. An act of 1649 declared that local heritors were to be assessed by kirk sessions to provide the financial resources for local relief, rather than relying on voluntary contributions.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 96. By the mid-seventeenth century the system had been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands.O. P. Grell and A. Cunningham, Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe, 1500‚Äì1700 (London: Routledge, 1997), , p. 37. The system was largely able to cope with general poverty and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in the major subsistence crisis of the 1690s.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , pp. 127 and 145. The kirk also had a major role in education. Statutes passed in 1616, 1633, 1646 and 1696 established a parish school system, paid for by local heritors and administered by ministers and local presbyteries.. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.R. Anderson, \\"The history of Scottish Education pre-1980\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 219‚Äì28. In the seventeenth century the pursuit of witchcraft was largely taken over by the kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. The most intense witch hunt was in 1661‚Äì62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. There may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.B. P. Levak, \\"The decline and end of Scottish witch-hunting\\", in J. Goodare, ed., The Scottish Witch- Hunt in Context (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), , pp. 166‚Äì180. Eighteenth century A Scottish communion token from 1750 The kirk had considerable control over the lives of the people. It had a major role in the Poor Law and schools, which were administered through the parishes, and over the morals of the population, particularly over sexual offences such as adultery and fornication. A rebuke was necessary for moral offenders to \\"purge their scandal\\". This involved standing or sitting before the congregation for up to three Sundays and enduring a rant by the minister. There was sometimes a special repentance stool near the pulpit for this purpose. In a few places the subject was expected to wear sackcloth. From the 1770s private rebukes were increasingly administered by the kirk session, particularly for men from the social elites, while until the 1820s the poor were almost always give a public rebuke.C. G. Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997), , p. 72. In the early part of the century the kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, attempted to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which secular tunes were played.J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 22. The oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725.M. Gardiner,Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 193‚Äì4. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that lining out should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing the psalms stanza by stanza.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , pp. 143‚Äì4. In the second half of the century these innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 26. Among Episcopalians, Qualified Chapels used the English Book of Common Prayer. They installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches, singing in the liturgy as well as metrical psalms, while the non-jurors had to worship covertly and less elaborately. When the two branches united in the 1790s, the non-juring branch soon absorbed the musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.R. M. Wilson, Anglican Chant and Chanting in England, Scotland, and America, 1660 to 1820 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), , p. 192. Catholic worship was deliberately low key, usually in the private houses of recursant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.N. Yates, Preaching, Word and Sacrament: Scottish Church Interiors 1560‚Äì1860 (A&C; Black, 2009), , p. 94. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them to take part in the ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark. Nineteenth century The Drunkard's Progress, a US lithograph from 1846, shows the stages of alcoholism that were common in temperance propaganda The rapid population expansion in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, particularly in the major urban centres, overtook the system of parishes on which the established church depended, leaving large numbers of \\"unchurched\\" workers, who were estranged from organised religion. The Kirk began to concern itself with providing churches in the new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Chaired by Thomas Chalmers, by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription.C. Brooks, \\"Introduction\\", in C. Brooks, ed., The Victorian Church: Architecture and Society (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), , pp. 17‚Äì18. The new churches were most attractive to the middle classes and skilled workers. The majority of those in severe hardship could not afford pew rents needed to attend and remained outside of the church system.O. Checkland and S. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), , p. 123. Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools.T. M. Devine, The Scottish Nation, 1700‚Äì2000 (London: Penguin Books, 2001), , pp. 91‚Äì100. Attempts to supplement the parish system included Sunday schools. Originally begun in the 1780s by town councils, they were adopted by all religious denominations in the nineteenth century. By the 1830s and 1840s these had widened to include mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes, open to members of all forms of Protestantism and particularly aimed at the growing urban working classes. By 1890 the Baptists had more Sunday schools than churches and were teaching over 10,000 children. The number would double by 1914.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 403. The problem of a rapidly growing industrial workforce meant that the Old Poor Law, based on parish relief administered by the church, had broken down in the major urban centres. Thomas Chambers, who advocated self-help as a solution, lobbied forcibly for the exclusion of the able bodied from relief and that payment remained voluntary, but in periods of economic downturn genuine suffering was widespread. After the Disruption in 1845 the control of relief was removed from the church and given to parochial boards, but the level of relief remained inadequate for the scale of the problem.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , pp. 392‚Äì3. Ira D. Sankey, whose singing and compositions helped popularise accompanied church music in Scotland in the late nineteenth century The beginnings of the temperance movement can be traced to 1828‚Äì29 in Maryhill and Greenock, when it was imported from America. By 1850 it had become a central theme in the missionary campaign to the working classes. A new wave of temperance societies included the United Order of Female Rechabites and the Independent Order of Good Templars, which arrived from the US in 1869 and within seven years had 1,100 branches in Scotland.A. Gray and W. Moffat, A History of Scotland: Modern Times (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989), , p. 18. The Salvation Army also placed an emphasis on sobriety.G. M. Ditchfield, The Evangelical Revival (London: Routledge, 1998), , p. 91. The Catholic Church had its own temperance movement, founding Catholic Total Abstinence Society in 1839. They made common cause with the Protestant societies, holding joint processions.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 404. Other religious-based organisations that expanded in this period included the Orange Order, which had 15,000 members in Glasgow by the 1890s. Freemasonry also made advances in the late nineteenth century, particularly among skilled artisans. There was a liturgical revival in the late nineteenth century strongly influenced by the English Oxford Movement, which encouraged a return to Medieval forms of architecture and worship, including the reintroduction of accompanied music into the Church of Scotland.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 149. The revival saw greater emphasis on the liturgical year and sermons tended to become shorter.D. M. Murray, \\"Sermons\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 581‚Äì2. The Church Service Society was founded in 1865 to promote liturgical study and reform. A year later organs were officially admitted to Church of Scotland churches.R. W. Munro, \\"Churches: 2 1843‚Äì1929\\" in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 91‚Äì2. They began to be added to churches in large numbers and by the end of the century roughly a third of Church of Scotland ministers were members of the society and over 80 per cent of kirks had both organs and choirs. However, they remained controversial, with considerable opposition among conservative elements within the churchS. J. Brown, \\"Scotland and the Oxford Movement\\", in S. J. Brown, Peter B. Nockles and Peter Benedict Nockles, eds, The Oxford Movement: Europe and the Wider World 1830‚Äì1930 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), , p. 73. and organs were never placed in some churches. In the Episcopalian Church the influence of the Oxford Movement and links with the Anglican Church led to the introduction of more traditional services and by 1900 surpliced choirs and musical services were the norm.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Episcopalian community\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 234‚Äì5. The Free Church was more conservative over music, and organs were not permitted until 1883.S. J. Brown, \\"Beliefs and religions\\" in T. Griffiths and G. Morton, A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1800 to 1900 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , p. 122. Hymns were first introduced in the United Presbyterian Church in the 1850s. They became common in the Church of Scotland and Free Church in the 1870s. The Church of Scotland adopted a hymnal with 200 songs in 1870 and the Free Church followed suit in 1882. The visit of American Evangelists Ira D. Sankey (1840‚Äì1908), and Dwight L. Moody (1837‚Äì99) to Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1874‚Äì75 helped popularise accompanied church music in Scotland.P. Maloney, Scotland and the Music Hall, 1850‚Äì1914 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), , p. 197. Sankey made the harmonium so popular that working- class mission congregations pleaded for the introduction of accompanied music.T. M. Devine, The Scottish Nation: A Modern History (London: Penguin, 2012), . The Moody-Sankey hymn book remained a best seller into the twentieth century. Early twentieth century An Orange Order march in Glasgow Church attendance in all denominations declined after World War I. Reasons that have been suggested for this change include the growing power of the nation state, socialism and scientific rationalism, which provided alternatives to the social and intellectual aspects of religion. By the 1920s roughly half the population had a relationship with one of the Christian denominations. This level was maintained until the 1940s when it dipped to 40 per cent during World War II, but it increased in the 1950s as a result of revivalist preaching campaigns, particularly the 1955 tour by Billy Graham, and returned to almost pre-war levels. From this point there was a steady decline that accelerated in the 1960s. By the 1980s it was just over 30 per cent. The decline was not even geographically, socially, or in terms of denominations. It most affected urban areas and the traditional skilled working classes and educated middle classes, while participation stayed higher in the Catholic Church than the Protestant denominations.R. J. Finley, \\"Secularization\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 516‚Äì17. Sectarianism became a serious problem in the twentieth century. In the interwar period religious and ethnic tensions between Protestants and Catholics were exacerbated by economic depression. The Orange Order was still dominated by Irish Protestants and became a focus for Anti-Catholic feeling. It appealed strongly to working class Protestants and organised parades and carnivalesque commemorations of the Battle of the Boyne that veered into riotous behaviour.G. Walker, \\"The religious factor\\" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 590. Tensions were heightened by the leaders of the Free Church and Church of Scotland and later the reunified church, who orchestrated a racist campaign against the Catholic Irish in Scotland. Key figures leading the campaign were George Malcolm Thomson and Andrew Dewar Gibb. This focused on the threat to the \\"Scottish race\\" based on spurious statistics that continued to have influence despite being discredited by official figures in the early 1930s. This created a climate of intolerance that led to calls for jobs to be preserved for Protestants. After the Second World War the Church became increasingly liberal in attitude and moved away from hostile attitudes. Sectarian attitudes continued to manifest themselves in football rivalries between Protestant and Catholic supporters. This was most marked in Glasgow in the traditionally Roman Catholic team, Celtic, and the traditionally Protestant team, Rangers. Celtic employed Protestant players and managers, but Rangers have had a tradition of not recruiting Catholics.C. Brown, The Social History of Religion in Scotland Since, 1730 (London: Routledge, 1987), , p. 243. Major watersheds were Rangers signing of the Catholic player Mo Johnston (b. 1963) in 1989, and in 1999 the appointment of their first Catholic captain, Lorenzo Amoruso. At the same time there were moves towards creating links between the various denominations. The Scottish Council of Churches was formed as an ecumenical body in 1924.B. Talbot, 1 \\"Baptists and other Christian Churches in the first half of the Twentieth Century\\" (2009), retrieved 30 May 2014. In the early twentieth century the Catholic Church in Scotland formalised the use of hymns, with the publication of The Book of Tunes and Hymns (1913), the Scottish equivalent of the Westminster Hymnal.T. E. Muir, Roman Catholic Church Music in England, 1791‚Äì1914: A Handmaid of the Liturgy? (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2013), . The foundation of the ecumenical Iona Community in 1938, on the island of Iona off the coast of Scotland, led to a highly influential form of music, which was used across Britain and the US. Leading musical figure John Bell (b. 1949) adapted folk tunes or created tunes in a folk style to fit lyrics that often emerged from the spiritual experience of the community.D. W. Music, Christian Hymnody in Twentieth-Century Britain and America: an Annotated Bibliography (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001), , p. 10. Later twentieth century to the present Plaque on Scottish Church House, Dunblane, one of the major centres of the ecumenical movement in Scotland in the twentieth century Relations between Scotland's churches steadily improved during the second half of the twentieth century and there were several initiatives for cooperation, recognition and union. The Scottish Council of Churches was formed as an ecumenical body in 1924. Proposals in 1957 for union with the Church of England were rejected over the issue of bishops and were severely attacked in the Scottish press. The Scottish Episcopal church opened the communion table up to all baptised and communicant members of all the trinitarian churches and church canons were altered to allow the interchangeability of ministers within specific local ecumenical partnerships. The Dunblane consultations, informal meetings at the ecumenical Scottish Church House in Dunblane in 1961‚Äì69, attempted to produce modern hymns that retained theological integrity. They resulted in the British \\"Hymn Explosion\\" of the 1960s, which produced multiple collections of new hymns.D. W. Music, Christian Hymnody in Twentieth-Century Britain and America: an Annotated Bibliography (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001), , p. 3. In 1990, the Scottish Churches' Council was dissolved and replaced by Action of Churches Together in Scotland (ACTS), which attempted to bring churches together to set up ecumenical teams in the areas of prisons, hospitals, higher education and social ministries and inner city projects.Robert C. Lodwick, Remembering the Future: The Challenge of the Churches in Europe (Friendship Press, 1995), , p. 16. At the end of the twentieth century the Scottish Churches Initiative for Union (SCIFU), between the Episcopal Church, the Church of Scotland, the Methodist Church and the United Reformed Church, put forward an initiative whereby there would have been mutual recognition of all ordinations and that subsequent ordinations would have satisfied episcopal requirements, but this was rejected by the General Assembly in 2003.Ian S. Markham, J. Barney Hawkins, IV, Justyn Terry, Leslie Nu√±ez Steffensen, eds, The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to the Anglican Communion (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2013), . The decline in religious affiliation continued in the early twenty-first century. In the 2001 census, 27.5 per cent who stated that they had no religion (which compares with 15.5 per cent in the UK overall) and 5.5 per cent did not state a religion. In the 2011 census roughly 54 per cent of the population identified with a form of Christianity and 36.7 per cent stated they had no religion. Other studies suggest that those not identifying with a denomination or who see themselves as non-religious may be much higher at between 42 and 56 per cent, depending on the form of question asked.J. McManus, \\"Two-thirds of Britons not religious, suggests survey\\", BBC NEWS UK, 21 March 2011, retrieved 15 February 2014. In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through immigration and higher birth rates among ethnic minorities, rather than large numbers of converts.S. Gilliat-Ray, Muslims in Britain (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), , p. 118. Those faiths with the most adherents in the 2011 census were Islam (1.4 per cent, mainly among immigrants from South Asia), Hinduism (0.3 per cent), Buddhism (0.2 per cent) and Sikhism (0.2 per cent). Other minority faiths include Judaism, the Bah√°'√≠ Faith and small Neopagan groups. There are also various organisations which actively promote humanism and secularism.

It was named Neo (\\"new\\") Chorio because it was a new village, but it was built on the ruins of an old village which was destroyed during the raids in Crete. It is built on a stone hill on a plain that is crossed by the river Mantamas. Smaller rivers include: the Anavreti, the Koliakoudes, etc. According to tradition, the small town was originally settled in the Late Minoan era, on a site located in the northernmost part of the village where it still stands today. According to the census of 1881, the village had only 451 inhabitants. At the village square, there is a plane tree which is many centuries old. Under this tree, there is a famous well. The plane tree and the well have been there since the Venetian domination. In the past, water was supplied by the rivers Koliakoude and Mantama. Later, when the village was destroyed, the inhabitants moved south and people collected water from the Koliakoude river. Even today, there are still many wells and cisterns within the village, the most important of which is the well of Anavreti. Agios Thomas‚Äôs church is located in the village‚Äôs square and is a royal rhythm church. In the Turkish domination this church was used as a cemetery and a school. The Agios Gerasimos is a graphic little church which was built on a rock at the edge of the village going towards to Bryses. The Agios Therapontas church is Byzantine rhythm and was built in 1971. Today, the cemetery is located on a hill 100 meters high, located near the church of Koimisi tis Theotokou. During the Turkish domination, priests and nuns took on the role of teachers and secretly taught the Greek language to the children of the village. The only school in the village was built in 1900. The fort of Koule was built by the Turks to control the passage from Apokoronas to Keramia. Bibliography 1\\\\.

Examples =Government= Memphis Regional Megasite, Golden Triangle (Mississippi), and Research Triangle Park (North Carolina) are examples of government initiated Megasites in America. =Private= CenterPoint Properties, Eastman Business Park, and Denver Tech Center are examples of private Mega-Sites. =University= Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park) was the first university to facilitate a private Megasite, that led to the creation of Silicon Valley. Military bases to Megasites Decommissioned military bases have been converted in the past to economic hubs. They repurpose the buildings and redevelop the land while working with and selling/leasing the land to private developers. Military bases are secessioned from the state, hence they don't have to pay sales taxes at the exchanges. If they were to keep that land partitioned from the state, business and property would be exempt from local and state taxes, making it a boom for business clusters.

Its functions include the investigation of cybercrime.  History  PolTel has been created in 1981 as a special department of the Polizia di Stato in order to ensure safety, prevention and the repression of crimes on the field of the Italian Ministry of mail and telecommunications. Initially, it oversaw postal offices and protected armoured trucks during operations of valuables transport. The personnel was active in vigilance services for money and valuables transport operated by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, along with the railroad police (Polfer). After a privatization process in Italy and the foundation of Poste Italiane S.p.A. in 1998, the police service has been renamed in \\"Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni\\". Following the reform of the public security administration, the Postal and Communications Police has become a cutting-edge \\"special division\\" of the State Police against cybercrimes, respecting the constitutional values of privacy and freedom.  Organization  The interministerial decree issued on 19 January 1999 describes the postal police as the \\"central body of the Ministry of the Interior for its security and the telecommunications services regularity\\": * The postal and communications police service, with its headquarters in Rome, co-ordinates 20 divisions located in every regional administrative centre (like Milan, Florence, Naples, etc.), except for the Aosta Valley which belongs to Turin's department. Sicily is divided in two departments with their headquarters located in Palermo (Sicilia Occidentale) and Catania (Sicilia Orientale) *The departments have regional competence and generally they are directed by a First executive of the State Police. Departments coordinate in turn the sections inside their territory * There are 76 sections of PolTel and each of them has provincial competence, under the direction of Inspectors. Tasks  PolTel represents the branch of the Italian Police specialized in prevention, control and repression of all the penal and administrative crimes belonging to the communication field, criminal activities on the internet and cybercrime in general. According to the law, it has an exclusive on struggling against online child pornography. PolTel operates closely with the Autorit√† per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni (AGCOM) and the regional communication inspectorates of the Ministry of Economic Development. PolTel has signed agreements with agencies and companies as Poste Italiane, Associazione Bancaria Italiana, GSE S.p.a (Gestore dei servizi energetici), Ferrovie dello Stato, hospitals, etc. PolTel performs judicial investigation for all the cybercrimes added by time into the Italian penal code, and for all crimes committed through more recent IT. Judicial police activity is not exclusively a web-intelligence one (monitoring chat lines, newsgroup, social network, etc), but it is also competent in: hacking (intrusions, computer damages), telephony (fixed and mobile, VoIP), privacy, eventually author's rights and copyright (videos, music, pay-tv), e-commerce, surveillance over radio and TV frequencies, frauds related to home banking, political subversion, terrorism, illegal trades of drugs, weapons and explosives, or every traditional crime that have a computer as a target or medium. = High competence on cybercrimes = Ministry of Interior's decree issued in 28 April 2006 says that: Competences of every Police force, including PolTel, has been revised by the Minniti Decree of 15 August 2017, which defines: PolTel is also engaging in investigations to prevent and counteract copyright violations which can be performed online, cooperating with other Italian Police forces and in particular with Guardia di Finanza according to the art. 2, paragraph 2, letter l of the legislative decree n. 68 of 2001. The special Police department guarantees also the general integrity and functionality of the computer network, including the protection of critical infrastructures managed with IT systems and of all national strategic assets.

She is also a freelance game journalist for several websites. In June 2018, Dykstra received media attention following an article she wrote on Medium detailing her alleged abuse from a former partner, subsequently identified as Chris Hardwick. Early life Dykstra was born in Los Angeles, California and is the daughter of American special effects artist John Dykstra. Cosplay Long before joining the team of cosplayers in Heroes of Cosplay, Chloe Dykstra made and exhibited a variety of cosplay characters. Characters include video game characters such as Lara Croft from Tomb Raider, Aela the Huntress from Skyrim, GLaDOS from Portal and Elizabeth from BioShock. She has also cosplayed as a steampunk avatar from Minecraft, Doctor Whos Clara Oswald, and fem 11th Doctor. She also played the role of Triple H in a YouTube video by Max Landis called \\"Wrestling Isn't Wrestling\\". Dykstra produced and co-hosted the Nerdist Industries cosplay focused web series Just Cos. Dykstra was featured in a Daily Dot article for her parody photo essay of Me In My Place pin-up blog photos. Acting Dykstra had her first major acting role starring as Cello Shea in the film Diminuendo opposite Battlestar Galactica star Richard Hatch. Account of alleged abuse by former partner In a June 2018 article on Medium, Dykstra alleged that she had been subjected to emotional and sexual abuse by a former partner for three years. She also said that, on leaving the relationship, she was blacklisted by her former partner and as a result was denied employment opportunities. Dykstra did not name her abusive former partner, but other media outlets used descriptive and timeline information from her article to conclude that it was Chris Hardwick, including the abuser being nearly 20 years her senior (Hardwick is nearly 17 years older). Hardwick has denied Dykstra's allegations, saying, \\"Our three year relationship was not perfect‚Äîwe were ultimately not a good match and argued‚Äîeven shouted at each other‚Äîbut I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her.\\" Three former girlfriends and his wife all say that Hardwick has never been abusive with them. On July 26, 2018, Dykstra issued a statement via her Twitter account that she now intended to move on with her life.NOTE: Full statement attached to the tweet as an image. In that statement she also noted that she had declined to participate in the investigation being undertaken by the organization that had employed her alleged abuser, explaining in a later tweet that participating in that investigation would have exposed her to risk(s) beyond her control. As before, she declined to name either her alleged abuser or the organization for which he worked, but reports from the entertainment news media on Dykstra's statement also noted that Chris Hardwick had been reinstated as the host of AMC's Talking Dead television show. \\"I have been adamant since I came forward with my essay that I never set out to ruin the career of the person I spoke about,\\" Dykstra wrote. \\"I could have provided more details on the matter but chose not to.

He was a great master of the Italian Renaissance style. Life Robert Matheson was born on 15 August 1808 (date on his tombstone, illustrated in this article) in Tain in the far north of Scotland, which explains later links to this otherwise remote location (see Works). He was the son of James Matheson, a cabinet maker, and Alexie Urquhart.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Matheson The mother‚Äôs name might be wrong as it is curiously similar to the name of Matheson's wife, Alexa Urquhart (1812 - 1897, also mentioned on the tomb stone), or it could be a strange but not impossible coincidence: Matheson could easily have married a cousin, who, given the traditional adherence to a recurring set of first names within a family or clan, might well have had a name similar to his mother's. In any case, other sources identifying the architect in question as a Robert Matheson, born 29 November 1807 in Edinburgh, the son of Robert Matheson and Elizabeth Fraser, are discredited by the inscription on the tomb stone. Early life is unclear but in 1828 he became apprenticed to Robert Reid, one of the foremost Edinburgh architects of the period.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, by Gifford McWilliam and Walker In 1848 through a series of events he came to be appointed Clerk of Works for Scotland, a very prestigious role.

He is buried with his children (three of whom died very young) and his wife Alexa Urquhart (1812-1897).

The paper was launched as a bi-weekly in November 1912. During the years of World War I American government repression of the IWW and its press forced the publication to make a series of name changes in an attempt to keep ahead of postal authorities. The original name was restored in 1923 and B√©rmunk√°s continued until its eventual termination in 1953. Publication history =Background= Hungarian radicalism in the United States of America dates back to the defeat of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the exile of Governor-President of Hungary Lajos Kossuth.Gerald Markowitz and Alex Rosner, \\"Hungarian Americans,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First Edition. New York: Garland Publishing, 1990; pg. 345. Over the next six decades about 1.7 million people emigrated from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, of whom somewhere between one-third and one-half were Hungarian language-speaking Magyars. A majority of these were peasants, but perhaps one-third of these were industrial workers from Budapest and other cities, many of whom were familiar with the ideas of trade unionism and socialism. The Hungarian √©migr√©s to America tended to cluster in the industrial cities of the Eastern and Midwestern United States, including New York City, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Chicago. These tended to work at difficult and dangerous physical jobs in heavy industry, mining, meatpacking, and manufacturing. A certain percentage also worked as skilled and semi-skilled workers in lighter industries such as carpentry, woodworking, and printing.Markowitz and Rosner, \\"Hungarian Americans,\\" pg. 346. Although at least four Hungarian-speaking local unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AF of L) emerged in the early 20th century, most Hungarian workers were unrepresented by the AF of L and its member unions owing to the unskilled nature of their jobs. Some effort was made to organize these workers politically through the Socialist Party of America and the socialist magazine El≈ëre, but it was not until the aftermath of the strike wave of 1909-1911 that serious efforts would be made to coordinate the activities of Hungarian workers through the radical syndicalist union, Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).Julianna Pusk√°s, \\"B√©rmunk√°s,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 322. =Establishment= The IWW launched B√©rmunk√°s (The Wage Worker), a newspaper in the Hungarian-language targeted to the largely unskilled Hungarian-American working class, in the fall of 1912, with the first issue dated November 15 of that year. The paper was launched by a board of editors, most of whom were first exposed to the ideas of revolutionary industrial unionism in Hungary. Issued as a bi-weekly in its initial incarnation, B√©rmunk√°s published news of the strike movement and details of the affairs of the Hungarian-language branches of the IWW. The publication came to be affiliated with the Federated Press and the Defense News Service in later years.Solon DeLeon and Nathan Fine (eds.), American Labor Press Directory. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1925; pg. 11. =Wartime repression= With the coming of American entry into World War I in the spring of 1917, repression against political dissidents and the radical labor movement became severe, with Postmaster General Albert Burleson removing the right to send opposition newspapers inexpensively via second class mail. B√©rmunk√°s was one of the first two IWW newspapers to lose its mailing privileges, along with the Italian language paper Il Proletario. There was also an effort to decapitate the radical Hungarian labor movement through the jailing of its leaders, including B√©rmunk√°s editor K√°roly Rotfischer, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison as a result of a prosecution set in motion by the United States Department of Justice. In an effort to keep the Hungarian IWW press alive and in the mails, a series of name changes followed, with B√©rmunk√°s relaunched as Ipari Munk√°s (Industrial Worker) in 1917, K√ºzdelem (The Struggle) in 1918, and Felszab√°dul√°s (Liberation) in 1919. It was not until 1923 and the release of the wartime IWW prisoners that the political situation had calmed down sufficiently for the original name of the publication, B√©rmunk√°s, to be restored. =Circulation= The circulation of B√©rmunk√°s at the time of its launch was approximately 1,500, and it is believed that the publication maintained a more or less steady circulation at this level until the advent of World War I. A peak circulation of 6,000 copies per week was claimed by the paper in 1925. In subsequent years the paper's readership atrophied, in tandem with the declining membership of the IWW and the declining number of Hungarian-born workers in the United States, with scholar Julianna Pusk√°s estimating a circulation of approximately 1,000 during the newspapers declining years. =Later years and termination= Following the restoration of the original name of the paper in 1923, the financing and publication of B√©rmunk√°s was aided by an organization known as the Munk√°s Betegseg√©lyz≈ë Sz√∂vets√©g (Workingmen's Association). The publication paid increasing attention to the history of the IWW and the publication of scientific and technical information for its readers during its final decades. With its circulation falling B√©rmunk√°s lost critical mass and was terminated by the IWW in 1953.

Mizner served as President of the California Senate and was US Minister (ambassador) to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.Lansing Bond Mizner - People - Department History - Office of the Historian Early life Lansing B. Mizner was born on December 5, 1825, in Monroe County, Illinois, son of Henry Caldwell Mizner, who died when Lansing was 4. His stepfather, James Semple, was fluent in Spanish and was appointed Charg√© d'affaires to the Republic of New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama, and pieces of neighboring countries). The family lived in Bogot√°, Colombia for five years (1837‚Äî1842), during which Lansing also became fluent in Spanish. He studied at Shurtleff College. Career At the age of 22 he entered the United States Army, and served in the Mexican War on the staff of General Shields. He arrived in California by way of New Orleans and Panama May 20, 1843 (not 1849), settled at Benicia, and became a partner in the general merchandise firm of Semple, Robinson & Co. He was admitted to the bar the same year. He was a member of the Society of California Pioneers. His adult home was in Benicia, California, He served as the first Collector of Customs for the Northern District of California (San Francisco to the Oregon border). When the state government was formed in 1849, he was elected the Associate Justice of the Solano County Court of Sessions. He was elected as a California State Senator in the 1865 and 1867 California Senates, and served as Chairman of the Commerce and Navigation and the Swamp Land Committees, and eventually President. Afterwards, he worked for Benjamin Harrison's 1888 presidential campaign. Minister to Central America Under the administration of Harrison, Mizner was appointed in 1889 Minister to Central America, in essence the ambassador to Guatemala (where he was based), Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. (Panama at that time was part of Colombia.) He was fluent in Spanish. When he traveled to Guatemala to take up his duties he was accompanied by his sons, the future architect Addison Mizner and future playwright Wilson Mizner. He lasted in the position just over a year. Mizner's first rebuke, from an Acting Secretary of State, was for calling for a union of the five Central American republics for protection from the more powerful Mexico to the north and Colombia to the south. (Mexico and Colombia both protested.) There was a complicated incident in which American arms were being shipped to El Salvador (which had just had a coup d'√©tat), and Guatemala, under martial law, objected. In July, 1890, exiled Guatemalan General Juan Mart√≠n Barrundia was on an American ship scheduled to stop at Guatemalan ports. Mizner, unable to communicate with Washington, agreed to the Guatemalan government's request he be seized. Resisting arrest, Barrundia was killed on this American ship by a bullet from one of the Guatemalan policemen who boarded the American ship. This was too much for Washington, and he was terminated in November, 1890, by Secretary of State James G. Blaine. President William Henry Harrison justified Mizner's firing in his 1890 Annual Message. http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/presidents/benjamin-harrison/state-of-the- union-1890.php State Department papers also detail the incident. https://books.google.com/books?id=a1C3IVbrWDgC&pg;=PA30&dq;=a+daughter+of+general+barrundia&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiR4vbszcvbAhWCtlkKHTBACpIQ6AEIJzAA Barrundia left a widow and several daughters, one of whom visited Mizner's office before his removal and shot at him. https://books.google.com/books?id=a1C3IVbrWDgC&pg;=PA30&dq;=a+daughter+of+general+barrundia&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiR4vbszcvbAhWCtlkKHTBACpIQ6AEIJzAA Barrundia's widow Transito Hurtarte appealed to the State Department for damages.

He installed the first flush toilet in Benicia, which the children would show off to their friends. His wife was Ella Watson Mizner. He had seven children, one daughter Minnie, married to Horace Blanchard Chase, who later would found Stag's Leap Winery, and six boys: William, Lansing, Edgar, the architect Addison, Harvey, and Wilson.

College career  Bour attended George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Bour's father, mother, and older brother also attended the university. Bour's father played volleyball, his mother played softball and volleyball, and his brother, Jason, played baseball. His older brother Jason has the 12th-highest batting average in the school's history and was drafted in the 23rd round by the Cincinnati Reds in 2007. While attending George Mason University Justin Bour also created his own legacy. He had 1,273 putouts which placed him first in the category, tied for second in career home runs with 46, third in RBIs with 187, fourth in total bases with 404, fifth in fielding percentage with .986, sixth in slugging percentage with .621, and 11th in batting average .347. During his three years at George Mason University, Bour averaged 15 home runs and 62 runs batted with an OPS better than .901. He set a school record on March 6, 2007, when he hit two grand slams and had 9 RBIs in a 28-1 victory of Coppin State. In 2008, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. These record numbers led to Bour being drafted in the 2009 Major League Amateur Draft by the Chicago Cubs in the 25th round, even though he was thought to be a mid-round selection. Since 1978, 52 players have been signed or drafted in the baseball program at George Mason. Bour still practices there in the off season. Professional career =Chicago Cubs= Bour made his way through the Cubs minor league organization, peaking in 2012 with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies. Bour batted .283/.360/.455 and drove in 110 runs. He was named to the Southern League Postseason All-Star team. In the second half of the following season Bour hit 16 home runs with the Smokies but was blocked on the roster for first base by Anthony Rizzo. Bour was drafted by the Marlins in the Rule 5 draft in December 2013. =Miami Marlins= alt= Bour was first called up to the majors with the Marlins on June 1, 2014. Bour spent a majority of the 2015 season with the Marlins after proving himself with the Marlins in 2014. Bour did extremely well with the Marlins in 2015. On May 17, 2015 Bour made headlines for breaking up Shelby Miller‚Äôs no hit bid at Marlins Park with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. He also homered in four straight games June 30 ‚Äì July 3, 2015. He became the eighth Marlin in franchise history to accomplish this. In October Bour was named the National League Rookie of the Month for September. After the All-Star break Bour hit 13 home runs and drove in 46 runs. This production helped offset the power hitting that the Marlins lost after a hamate injury sustained by Giancarlo Stanton in June. Bour led the Marlins in RBIs that season with 73 and had 23 homers which placed him second behind Stanton for the season. Bour batted .262/.321/.479 for the season. Bour became a regular in the Marlins lineup in 2016 after finishing 5th in the National League Rookie of the Year voting the season prior after being called up. Bour was able to join the team full-time after the Marlins traded away first baseman Mike Morse who was not able to produce when signed to the full-time first base position. Bour started off strong in the 2016 season by hitting 15 home runs and 46 RBIs and batting .268 by the end of June. In June alone Bour hit 6 home runs and 20 RBIs with a batting line of .317/.411/.651. This hot streak was snapped when Bour became injured July 2 by rolling his ankle against the Atlanta Braves, he was placed on the disabled list July 6. While recovering Bour played a few games with the Triple-A New Orleans team before rejoining the Marlins. The Triple-A New Orleans stint did not go as planned for Bour as he was shut down by the Marlins from continuing with the minors. Bour did return to the Marlins though and was allowed to participate in infield and batting practice with the team at the beginning of August. Since the 15 day DL leave turned into a 60-day DL for Bour he did no return to the team until September 6. He did remain uninjured until the end of the season but did not hit any more home runs. Bour had a successful season in 2017, even having a couple firsts for his Major League career. One of the firsts for Bour was stealing a base against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Bour stole second base and had the pitcher, Zack Greinke, and catcher, Jeff Mathis, sign the base for him. Bour also was invited to participate in the 2017 Home Run Derby. Bour used what he called doughnut power during his home run derby competition and was even given doughnuts by his teammate Stanton during the competition. Bour hit 22 home runs in the first round, setting a record for the fourth most home runs in that round but was knocked out of the competition by Aaron Judge who hit 23 home runs. Bour finished the season with 25 home runs and 83 RBIs. During the off season before 2018 Bour was involved in an arbitration case against the Marlins. Bour won his case and his salary for 2018 was set at $3.4 million. In 2018 with the Marlins, Bour batted .227/.347/.412 with 19 home runs and 54 RBIs in 374 at bats.Justin Bour Stats  Baseball-Reference.com =Philadelphia Phillies= On August 10, 2018, the Philadelphia Phillies acquired Bour and cash considerations from the Miami Marlins for minor league LHP McKenzie Mills.

On April 30, 2014, it was announced that Hobart Ocean had signed a recording deal. Hobart Ocean released its first single titled Another Heartbreak in 2014. History =The Band‚Äôs Roots as Pop-Punk Band Vanattica= From 2006 to 2012, Travis Leonard, Steven Hopkins, and Jaron Lancaster found local and regional success as the DIY pop-punk band Vanattica in the Champaign-Urbana, Illinois area. Leonard had been attending UC Santa Barbara and transferred to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to compete on the school's track team. Vanattica toured several times and participated in a Warped Tour. In 2012, the three musicians moved to Los Angeles, where Leonard worked as an actor and model and Hopkins and Lancaster got day jobs while performing at clubs, including The Viper Room and Amplify. Leonard appeared on CMT's ‚ÄúSweet Home Alabama‚Äù. The three did an acoustic DIY tour up the West Coast. Seeking to expand beyond their all-acoustic sound, they put up a flyer at Musicians Institute in Hollywood, where drummer Hagstrom attended after moving to Los Angeles from a small town in Sweden. Hagstrom was the first of six players who auditioned for the band via YouTube videos. He joined one of their rehearsal sessions in North Hollywood and was hired for the band's show at Busby's. He then joined as a full-time. Hagstrom would later leave the band to marry Amanda Hagstrom. As Vanattica continued performing, Leonard began writing in an alt-pop style he thought might work for a side project. Having traveled to Australia and New Zealand, and having earned a Bachelor's in Geography and an M.S. in Medical Geography, he came up with a new name for the band. Hobart Ocean is named for the capital of Australia's island state of Tasmania. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs literally the end of the earth ‚Äì sort of like a small town in Illinois,‚Äù Leonard stated. His bandmates agreed to change the style and concept of the band. =Emergence as Hobart Ocean and Performances at Universal CityWalk= Leonard was on a date at Universal CityWalk, a shopping and entertainment district in Universal City, California, when he saw a crowd gathered around a female singer performing an acoustic set. He asked the performer how she scored the gig and later went online to apply, sending a demo CD, bio and website link. Two weeks later, Leonard received an email from NBC Universal inviting Hobart Ocean to audition. Kevin Lindsey and Stewart Irel, executives with NBC Universal asked the band to perform three songs to play outside on a Wednesday afternoon. They liked what they heard and Hobart Ocean played a total of ten songs. The band had a successful test show in December 2013 and started 2014 performing six to eight shows per month, playing for 5,000-10,000 people per night over four hours. Lindsey and Irel told them they beat out 150 other acts to secure the slot. Hobart Ocean's original set list mixed original songs and covers of various bands, including Jimmy Eat World and OneRepublic. The band also opened on CityWalk's Five Towers Stage for Heffron Drive. =‚ÄúAnother Heartbreak‚Äù and 2014 Fall Tour Dates with Aaron Carter= Hobart Ocean released its first single ‚ÄúAnother Heartbreak‚Äù in the fall of 2014. The track was written and recorded with a basic living room studio setup when Leonard, Lancaster and Hopkins were living together in a condo in Tarzana, California. They later brought the fully produced demo they created to a producer for mixing at a studio in Hollywood. While continuing to perform at Universal CityWalk, they performed four dates in November 2014 with American pop musician Aaron Carter on Aaron Carter's Wonderful World Tour.

Nevertheless, these two species have also been mixed in later studies, and there are records from the Guianas that have not yet been allocated to either species.

From 1842-1852, a Greek Revival palace was built in Oreanda by architect Andrei Stackenschneider. The American writer Mark Twain once stayed at the palace before it burned down in 1882. Leonid Brezhnev had a house in Oreanda which President Richard Nixon visited in 1974 following the Moscow Summit. In the 1940s-1950s, two sanatoriums were built in Oreanda, one of which was designed by Soviet Constructivist architect Moisei Ginzburg. In culture Much of Anton Chekhov's short story The Lady with the Dog, published in 1899, takes place in Oreanda.

The term was coined in the 1970s by Toshio Mura, who worked extensively on generalizing their mathematical treatment.. A non-uniform distribution of eigenstrains in a material (e.g., in a composite material) leads to corresponding eigenstresses, which affect the mechanical properties of the material.  Overview  Many distinct physical causes for eigenstrains exist, such as crystallographic defects, thermal expansion, the inclusion of additional phases in a material, and previous plastic strains. All of these result from internal material characteristics, not from the application of an external mechanical load. As such, eigenstrains have also been referred to as ‚Äústress-free strains‚Äùand ‚Äúinherent strains‚Äù. When one region of material experiences a different eigenstrain than its surroundings, the restraining effect of the surroundings leads to a stress state on both regions. Analyzing the distribution of this residual stress for a known eigenstrain distribution or inferring the total eigenstrain distribution from a partial data set are both two broad goals of eigenstrain theory.  Analysis of eigenstrains and eigenstresses  Eigenstrain analysis usually relies on the assumption of linear elasticity, such that different contributions to the total strain \\\\epsilon are additive. In this case, the total strain of a material is divided into the elastic strain e and the inelastic eigenstrain \\\\epsilon^*: :\\\\epsilon_{ij} = e_{ij} + \\\\epsilon_{ij}^* where i and j indicate the directional components in 3 dimensions in Einstein notation. Another assumption of linear elasticity is that the stress \\\\sigma can be linearly related to the elastic strain e and the stiffness C_{ijkl} by Hooke‚Äôs Law: :\\\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} e_{kl} In this form, the eigenstrain is not in the equation for stress, hence the term \\"stress-free strain\\". However, a non-uniform distribution of eigenstrain alone will cause elastic strains to form in response, and therefore a corresponding elastic stress. When performing these calculations, closed-form expressions for e (and thus, the total stress and strain fields) can only be found for specific geometries of the distribution of \\\\epsilon^*. = Ellipsoidal inclusion in an infinite medium = Ellipsoidal eigenstrain inclusion One of the earliest examples providing such a closed-form solution analyzed a ellipsoidal inclusion of material \\\\Omega_0 with a uniform eigenstrain, constrained by an infinite medium \\\\Omega with the same elastic properties. This can be imagined with the figure on the right. The inner ellipse represents the region \\\\Omega_0. The outer region represents the extent of \\\\Omega_0 if it fully expanded to the eigenstrain without being constrained by the surrounding \\\\Omega. Because the total strain, shown by the solid outlined ellipse, is the sum of the elastic and eigenstrains, it follows that in this example the elastic strain in the region \\\\Omega_0 is negative, corresponding to a compression by \\\\Omega on the region \\\\Omega_0. The solutions for the total stress and strain within \\\\Omega_0 are given by: :\\\\epsilon_{ij} = S_{ijkl} \\\\epsilon_{kl}^* :\\\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}(\\\\epsilon_{ij} - \\\\epsilon_{kl}^*) Where S is the Eshelby Tensor, whose value for each component is determined only by the geometry of the ellipsoid. The solution demonstrates that the total strain and stress state within the inclusion \\\\Omega_0 are uniform. Outside of \\\\Omega_0, the stress decays towards zero with increasing distance away from the inclusion. In the general case, the resulting stresses and strains may be asymmetric, and due to the asymmetry of S, the eigenstrain may not be coaxial with the total strain. =Inverse problem= Eigenstrains and the residual stresses that accompany them are difficult to measure (see:Residual stress). Engineers can usually only acquire partial information about the eigenstrain distribution in a material. Methods to fully map out the eigenstrain, called the inverse problem of eigenstrain, are an active area of research. Understanding the total residual stress state, based on knowledge of the eigenstrains, informs the design process in many fields. Applications =Structural engineering= Residual stresses, e.g. introduced by manufacturing processes or by welding of structural members, reflect the eigenstrain state of the material . This can be unintentional or by design, e.g. shot peening. In either case, the final stress state can affect the fatigue, wear, and corrosion behavior of structural components. Eigenstrain analysis is one way to model these residual stresses. =Composite materials= Since composite materials have large variations in the thermal and mechanical properties of their components, eigenstrains are particularly relevant to their study. Local stresses and strains can cause decohesion between composite phases or cracking in the matrix. These may be driven by changes in temperature, moisture content, piezoelectric effects, or phase transformations. Particular solutions and approximations to the stress fields taking into account the periodic or statistical character of the composite material's eigenstrain have been developed. =Strain engineering= Lattice misfit strains are also a class of eigenstrains, caused by growing a crystal of one lattice parameter on top of a crystal with a different lattice parameter. Controlling these strains can improve the electronic properties of an epitaxially grown semiconductor. See: strain engineering.

(Vers la f√©minisation?) subtitled ¬´ Deconstruction of an antidemocratic plot ¬ª (\\"D√©montage d'un complot antid√©mocratique\\") is a combative essay on feminism published in 1999 by the French polemicist Alain Soral.  Thesis  Soral starts from the position that women have always worked, for instance in the retail and agricultural sectors: the exception has been women at the top end of society. The invention of feminism will have been caused by boredom or rejection in respect of privileged women's conditions as housewives and mothers. In recent decades massive employment growth in the Tertiary (service) sector has provided a corresponding boom in employment opportunities for women. Provokingly, Soral distinguishes between two sorts of feminism, represented by the ‚Äúflipp√©es‚Äù\\"flipp√©es\\" = \\"fruit-cakes\\" (an imperfect but best on offer translation ) such as Simone de Beauvoir and the ‚Äúp√©tasses‚Äù,\\"p√©tasses\\" = \\"bitches\\" (an imperfect but best on offer translation ) such as √âlisabeth Badinter. Soral asserts that the important problem concerns not the equality between men and women but rather, and not withstanding the social changes of recent decades, equality between rich and poor, a traditional Marxist struggle from which he says the feminists, mostly representative of the most privileged classes, are trying to divert attention. For Soral ¬´ feminisation ¬ª is not so much a movement as an evolution supportive of the liberal capitalist economy. He points out that the appearance in the labour market of huge numbers of additional women contributes to salary stagnation. The fact that so many women earn salaries makes them [often] less critical and more committed as consumers than the men. Soral concludes that feminism is therefore a mask to conceal and sustain economic liberalism. Soral sees homosexuality as a substitute for the ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù response of a certain type of enraged feminist. He contends that the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of women and of homosexuals are historically and objectively allied, as evidenced by organisations (which he denounces) such as Act Up.  Controversy  Critics accuse Soral of misogyny or homophobia, although he has always rejected these contentions. The Paris-based journalist √âric Zemmour has published an anti-feminist book of his own, entitled ‚ÄúThe first Sex‚Äù (‚ÄúLe Premier Sexe‚Äù). Soral‚Äôs withering response, on his website, was to invite potential readers to ‚Äúprefer the original to the copy‚Äù ‚Äù pr√©f√©rer l'original √† la copie ‚Äú Soral‚Äôs implicit condemnation of the Zemmour book for its lack of originality must nevertheless be set against the way that Soral‚Äôs own work was heavily influenced by the Marxist philosopher and sociologist Michel Clouscard.

The book was by Edgar Smith, music by Jerome Kern and Frank Tours and lyrics by Edward Madden. Billee Taylor provided additional music and lyrics, and M. E. Rourke and Frederick Day provided additional lyrics. It premiered on Broadway in 1911. Production La Belle Paree was staged between 20 March 1911 and 10 June 1911 at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York, running for 104 performances. At first it was staged along with various companion pieces, including an overture, a one-act opera set in China, called Bow-Sing, an exotic dance sequence called Tortajada and Her Sixteen Moorish Dancing Girls in a Spanish Ballet, and an afterpiece. After opening night, the show was trimmed and reorganized, and the companion pieces were soon dropped. The show was produced by Lee Shubert and Jacob J. Shubert, staged by J. C. Huffman and William J. Wilson, and choreographed by Wilson. The production was briefly revived in September of the same year and then toured from September to November. Show The Shubert Brothers engaged Al Jolson for his first Broadway appearance in La Belle Paree, which was the first show to play at their new Winter Garden Theatre. The piece concerned Bridgeeta McShane, a wealthy American widow visiting Paris for her health, who meets a number of suitors and eccentric characters, including Erastus Sparkler, played by Jolson. Jolson soon converted this supporting role into a star vehicle, and he would make a dozen further Broadway appearances (often at the Winter Garden) in his varied career. The first performance was overlong and dragged in places, continuing until almost 1:00 am, and some of the audience left before the end. The reviews were mixed, and Jolson was disappointed with his own performance. Jolson was scheduled late in the program, as La Belle Paris followed most of the companion pieces. Jolson played a phony \\"colored aristocrat\\", the boyfriend of Bridgeeta's Black maid, played by Mayhew. He wore blackface, and together they sang Jerome Kern's coon song Paris is a Paradise for Coons, about the freedoms African-Americans supposedly enjoyed living in Paris rather than in \\"Yankee Land\\". They also sang another song together, Jolson gave a monologue and sang a third song during the evening. Many of the critics had already left before Jolson came on, to make their publication deadlines, but the critics that mentioned Jolson and Mayhew, including The New York Times, praised them. During the second performance, Jolson interrupted the performance to talk to the audience about the poor reviews, and then asked them if they would rather hear him sing. When they agreed, Jolson launched into a series of his own numbers. This time the reviews were very positive, and the show played for the rest of the season to solid audiences.

Lepomis peltastes was traditionally recognized as a subspecies of longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) but is often considered to be a separate species.Bailey, R. M., W. C. Latta, and G. R. Smith. 2004. An atlas of Michigan fishes with keys and illustrations for their identification. University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, Miscellaneous Publications 192, Ann Arbor.

A small, northern sunfish caught at Lake Leelanau, MI. Identification The northern sunfish (Lepomis peltastes) and the longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) contain very few physical variations. Both are generally small, vibrantly scaled fish with bright, elongated opercular flaps which give the fish an appearance of an ear. This \\"ear\\" is a key factor in differentiating the two fish. Lepomis peltastes opercular flaps tend to have an outline of white and red, while Lepomis megalotis outlines are strictly white. Although each species coloration is nearly identical, the patterns which form from these colors are not. The northern sunfish tends to have more of a lateral stripe and speckled turquoise pattern along its sides, while the longear sunfish tends to have spotting on its sides, still in turquoise. Each fish also has \\"war paint\\" all the way from the mouth to the edge of the gill flap in the same color as the speckles or spots. Both also contain olive sides and bright orange bellies. These few differences between Lepomis peltastes and Lepomis megalotis leave these fish incredibly hard to distinguish from one another.Michigan - Dearborn, University Of. \\"Fish.\\" Friends of the Rouge:. University of Michigan - Dearborn, Web. 04 Jan. 2015. Rouge Watershed - Northern Longear Sunfish. In all other aspects, these fish look near identical.

The assertion, brought about by Carl Leavitt Hubbs over three decades ago, has yet to be clarified with ichthyologists. Habitat and range The northern sunfish inhabits the uppermost portions of the United States, such as the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes Region, as well as the Hudson Bay, Mississippi River, and portions of Ontario. This fish is found in generally small, quiet, temperate streams or rivers with sandy banks or rocky bottoms.

It has provided grants to grassroots activist organizations around the country since its inception in 1967 as a result of the anti-war proclamation \\"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority\\".  History  RESIST formed in 1966 as an intellectual collective in response to the growing unrest surrounding the Vietnam War. First taking shape in the period leading up to the March on the Pentagon, Robert Barsky describes the collective's formation in Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent: In addition to Chomsky and Lauter, others involved in the organization's early stages included novelist Mitchell Goodman, novelist Hans Koning, poet Robert Lowell, writer Dwight Macdonald, leading lawyer for the Mobilization's Legal Defense Committee Ed de Grazia, poet Denise Levertov, and The Armies of the Night author Norman Mailer In the days leading up to the march, the collective penned \\"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,\\" which was published in the October 12th, 1967 edition of The New York Review of Books. The manifesto was signed by hundreds including Mitchell Goodman, Henry Braun, Denise Levertov, Noam Chomsky, William Sloane Coffin, Norman Mailer, Robert Lowell, Dwight Macdonald, Allen Ginsberg, Barbara Guest, Wilbur H. Ferry, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Leaflets were circulated among sympathizers prior to the march detailing their intended action: The March was met with police aggression, resulting in the arrests of Mailer, Chomsky, Dave Dellinger, and Dagmar Wilson. = The Boston Five = The publishing of \\"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority\\" led to the arrest of five of its signers, known as the Boston Five, in early 1968. These were Michael Ferber, Dr. Benjamin Spock, William Sloan Coffin, Mitchell Goodman, and Marcus Raskin. All five were members of RESIST. The indictment came on counts of \\"conspiring to 'counsel, aid, and abet' young men to refuse service in the armed forces and to refuse to have in their possession registration certificates and notices of classification.\\" The claims were met with opposition from anti-war sympathizers, including the some odd 200 members of RESIST. The organization's associate national director and professor of Humanities at M.I.T. Louis Kampf held a press conference to address the organization's response to the indictments. He stated that Resist was considering calling a national academic strike, and that a statement in support of the Five was gathering signatures. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was among the first to sign, \\"declaring that he too should go to jail if the five under indictment are sentenced.\\" As reported in The Harvard Crimson: > According to the indictment, Coffin, Goodman, Raskin, and Dr. Spock agreed > to sponsor a nationwide draft-resistance program that would include > disrupting the induction processes at various induction centers, making > public appeals for young men to resist the draft and to refuse to serve in > the military services, and issuing calls for registrants to turn in their > draft cards ... Another \\"overt act\\" of the alleged conspiracy is the > distribution in New York last August by Coffin and Dr. Spock of a statement > entitled \\"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority.\\" The aforementioned \\"nationwide draft-resistance program\\" is RESIST. = COINTELPRO = In the late 1960s and early 1970s RESIST received information from an underground group called \\"The Citizen's Commission to Investigate the FBI\\" regarding surveillance of various citizens and groups. The documents included \\"manuals and routine forms, 25 per cent concern bank robberies, 20 per cent murder, rape, and interstate theft, 7 per cent draft resistance, 7 per cent AWOL soldiers and 1 per cent organized crime, including gambling\\". In addition to these, intelligence was gathered about groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Jewish Defense League. These documents were part of a larger FBI initiative called COINTELPRO; an acronym for COunter INTELligence PROgram. The program \\"was a secret FBI program designed to monitor and \\"neutralize\\" domestic groups deemed by the FBI to be a danger to national security. Such groups included anti-war groups and civil rights groups and individuals like Martin Luther King, Jr. and even Eleanor Roosevelt\\" RESIST was the first to release leaked information surrounding the covert initiative, leading to the formation of the Church committee: an investigative senatorial committee whose purpose was to flesh out the true story behind the allegations. The allegations brought to light by RESIST turned out to be entirely correct, leading to the cessation of the program.  Today  RESIST has moved away from its front lines activist roots and now seeks to fund those that continue that work. In 2014, the organization gave 146 grants to grassroots activist organizations around the country, thanks to the help of over 7,000 donors, contributing an average gift of $129.00. Resist has broadened in scope since its inception to include issues of environmentalism, the rights of women, prisoners, undocumented immigrants, the LGBTQ community, and worker's rights, among others. The organization continues to work to support the groups that are chopping down the pillars that prop up everything from militarism to capitalism, from racism to patriarchy, and the intersections that connect them all.

He was from the Jalali family, a family native to Mazandaran which ruled Sari as governors of the Bavandids.  Biography  In 1349, Hasan II ordered the execution of one of his most powerful officials, Jalal ibn Ahmad Jal, who was from the Jalali family, and thus a relative of Vishtasp. The execution resulted in a revolt by the nobles of Mazandaran. Hasan then tried to get support from another Iranian family known as the Chulabids. However, the two sons of the Chulabid Kiya Afrasiyab, murdered Hasan while the latter was in a bath. Afrasiyab then gained control of the Bavandid territories, thus marking the end of the Bavand dynasty and the start of the Afrasiyab dynasty. He then made peace with the Jalali family, who had become the independent rulers of Sari. However, he was considered an usurper by his subjects, and was in 1359 overthrown by the Marashi Mir-i Buzurg. Mir-i Buzurg then turned against Jalali family; a battle shortly ensured between Mir-i Buzurg and Vishtasp Jalali and another Jalali noble Fakhr al-Din Jalali, where Mir-i Buzurg was victorious. With the help of former loyalists of Kiya Afrasiyab, Vishtasp then killed a son of Mir-i Buzurg. During the same period, Fakhr al-Din Jalali and his four sons were shortly killed in a battle by Mir-i Buzurg, who shortly entered Sari. Vishtasp then fled from Sari and took refuge with his family in a fortress. However, Mir-i Buzurg shortly besieged the fortress, and managed to capture it. He then had Vishtasp and his seven sons executed. A son of Mir-i Buzurg, Kamal al-Din I, then married the daughter of Vishtasp.

The focus of these societies is the study of the Autonomic nervous system, particularly clinical aspects of this field. The society was founded in October 1998.  Meetings  EFAS holds an annual congress, organized each year by another national autonomic society. Since the autonomic field in fact overlaps with a number of disciplines, several were held as joint meetings with partnering international societies. Partnering organizations for meetings had been the International Society for Autonomic Neuroscience (2009, 2013, 2015), the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now European Academy of Neurology) (2008, 2012), and the American Autonomic Society (2004, 2007). The 2018 meeting celebrating the 20th anniversary of the society will take place in Vienna in collaboration with the International Congress of Nerve and Muscle Diseases.  Education  Since 2009, EFAS started to organize regular teaching events, in the beginning with support of the European Federation of Neurological Societies. Motivation to initiate those events were the scarce clinical knowledge in autonomic fields based on the absence of structured training in many European countries. Consequently, EFAS initiated teaching events to promote knowledge. Target group for this initiative are young clinicians, interested in dysautonomia. This teaching initiative evolved and EFAS took effort to have it organized on an annual basis. Currently, one day of the annual congress is dedicated to training young doctors in autonomic evaluation skills (EFAS School).  Scientific journal and social media  The official journal of the society is Clinical Autonomic Research. In 2017, EFAS started to publish news on Twitter with the Username @EFAS_ANS.

Kapteyn b is within the estimated habitable zone of its star. It was the closest suspected potentially habitable exoplanet to the Solar System other than Tau Ceti e up until 2016, when Proxima Centauri b at 4.22 light-years was confirmed. It was pushed into fourth when Ross 128 b was confirmed in 2017. However, later research had cast doubt on the existence of Kapteyn b, suggesting the signal is consistent with stellar activity rather than a planet. This doubt, however, has been refuted by the original discovery team. The system itself is estimated to be 11 billion years old, substantially older than the Solar System.  Characteristics  =Mass, radius, and temperature= Kapteyn b is a super-Earth, a planet that has a radius and mass bigger than that of Earth, but smaller than that of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. It has a surface temperature of . It has a mass greater than or equal to 4.8 and a radius less than or equal to around 1.6 , depending on its composition, making it a likely rocky world. =Host star= The planet orbits a red subdwarf star named Kapteyn's Star. The star has a mass of 0.27 and a radius 0.29 . It has a surface temperatures of 3550 K and is roughly 11 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 8.85. It is too dim to be seen with the naked eye, but can be seen with good binoculars. = Orbit = Kapteyn b makes a complete orbit around its parent star with about 1.2% of the Sun's luminosity about every 48.62 days at a distance of 0.17 AU (compared to Mercury, which orbits at a distance of around 0.39 AU). It has an eccentricity of 0.21, meaning its orbit is mildly elliptical.  Habitability  The exoplanet was announced to be orbiting in the habitable zone of its parent star, the region where, with the correct conditions and atmospheric properties, liquid water may exist on the surface of the planet. Kapteyn b has a radius range of 1.2‚Äì1.6 , so it is likely rocky. Its host star is a red subdwarf, with a little more than a quarter as much mass than the Sun does. As a result, stars like Kapteyn's Star have the ability to live up to 100‚Äì200 billion years, 10‚Äì20 times longer than the Sun will live. Another crucial factor in habitability is temperature and atmospheric properties. The estimated equilibrium temperature for Kapteyn b is around , too cold to support liquid water on the surface. Without the proper greenhouse gases in its atmosphere (if it has one), it is likely to be a planet covered in ice. However, if it has enough in its atmosphere, the surface temperature may rise enough to have water exist in its liquid form on the surface. Discovery The planet was first discovered by the HARPS spectrometer which is housed at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile. Further confirmations of the planetary detection were made at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and at the PFS Observatory, also in Chile. The method of discovery involved observing and recording tiny wobbles in the star caused by the gravitational tug of its planets, using Doppler spectroscopy. Additional planet One other planet has been detected within the same planetary system. It is designated \\"Kapteyn c\\" and orbits further out from the star, beyond the outer edge of the habitable zone. It is considered to be too cold for stellar-light based life.

Pastorek, who reside in Ashburn, Virginia, have three grown children, Ryan Paul Pastorek, Jeffrey Thomas Pastorek, and Kaitlin Pastorek. Educational matters Pastorek was appointed in 1996 to BESE - eight other members are elected by districts - by the incoming Republican Governor Mike Foster. From 2001 to 2004, Pastorek was the BESE president, chosen by his ten colleagues. As education superintendent, Pastorek worked to establish more charter schools, to increase private funding in education, and to strengthen school accountability with the goal of a reduced dropout rate and greater academic achievement. The Louisiana State Legislature in 2003 created the Recovery School District to assume control of those schools deemed academic failures for four consecutive years. In New Orleans, 107 of the worst-performing public schools were placed under the RSD umbrella in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Pastorek drew criticism for his educational reforms from local school boards, state legislators, and teacher's unions, many of whom claimed that he lacked interest in their concerns about educational policies. Pastorek resigned as superintendent to become chief counsel and corporate secretary for EADS North America (the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company), since renamed Airbus Group, Inc. The defense contractor firm is headed by Sean O'Keefe, the former chancellor of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and the former NASA director, with whom Pastorek had earlier been a colleague. EADS headquarters are outside Washington, D.C., in Herndon, Virginia, with a second location in Ashburn in Loudoun County, where Pastorek resides. In 2013, Pastorek came to the defense of later superintendent John C. White, who is implementing the Common Core program in Louisiana despite reservations from various groups who fear federal intervention. At a conference in Washington, D.C., Pastorek said that the plan was originally proposed by state superintendents from across the nation, not by the United States Department of Education. Common Core, he said, is not a matter of indoctrination of school children in liberal politics but in establishing needed standards and achievement.

The district is bounded by Upper Street on the northwest; North Floyd Street on the northeast; High Street on the southeast; and North Ridge Street on the southwest. This area was developed beginning roughly in 1880 as a residential district catering to workers in the nearby tobacco-processing facilities. The houses in the district are in a blend of styles, but are characterized by similar lot sizes and setbacks. The district includes two churches, and a building that originally served as a tobacco prizery (a building where tobacco leaves are packed into barrels). The neighborhood was a center of civil rights activism during the 1960s, playing host to Martin Luther King, Jr. It was once somewhat larger; areas to the west and north were razed during urban redevelopment efforts.

History It began in 1997 when Hamling spotted a gap in the market for patients to get complex intravenous treatments on a same-day basis. Bloom and Hamling raised ¬£150,000 from family to start their first compounding company. They received their license from the MHRA in August 1998 and pioneered a same-day intravenous medication service, through their first contract from the Royal Brompton Hospital, London for prefilled syringes of antibiotics for cystic fibrosis children. After selling their first company, they used the proceeds to set up ITH Pharma in 2008. ITH Pharma is the largest provider of reactive, same-day, specialist, intravenous products in the UK, feeding 1000 patients per day and treating over 2000 patients per day on chemotherapy. Controversy In June 2014, a batch of intravenous feed supplied to hospitals by ITH Pharma in the UK for neonatal care was delivered in an allegedly contaminated state, with about 16 alleged cases of blood poisoning in infants. On 31 October 2018 the BBC reported that ITH Pharma were charged with a number of offences following the deaths and illness of babies in some hospitals in England. They were charged with seven counts of supplying medicinal product not of the quality specified in the prescription. They were also charged with failing to take reasonable steps to ensure patients are not infected by contaminants, in breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act. The babies, many of whom were premature, were being fed through drips in neonatal intensive care units, between 2009 and 2014. ITH Pharma said it was disappointed by the decision to charge the company and would \\"vigorously defend\\" the case.

He is currently a professor at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain). Biography In 1977, Yurii Nesterov graduated in applied mathematics at Moscow State University. From 1977 to 1992 he was a researcher at the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Since 1993, he has been working at UCLouvain, specifically in the Department of Mathematical Engineering from the Louvain School of Engineering, Center for Operations Research and Econometrics. In 2000, Nesterov received the Dantzig Prize. In 2009, Nesterov won the John von Neumann Theory Prize. In 2016, Nesterov received the EURO Gold Medal. Academic work Nesterov is most famous for his work in convex optimization, including his 2004 book, considered a canonical reference on the subject. His main novel contribution is an accelerated version of gradient descent that converges considerably faster than ordinary gradient descent (commonly referred as Nesterov momentum or Nesterov accelerated gradient, in short ‚Äî NAG). His work with Arkadi Nemirovski in the 1994 book is the first to point out that the interior point method can solve convex optimization problems, and the first to make a systematic study of semidefinite programming (SDP). Also in this book, they introduced the self-concordant functions which are useful in the analysis of Newton's method.

It is a static version of volumetric display. Volumetric prints are auto-stereoscopic, full parallax (in both horizontal and vertical viewing arrangements) and can be viewed by multiple viewers in regular room lighting. A volumetric print can be thought of as a reconstructed light field based on the scattering of light by distributed pigments in volume. Any three-dimensional scene can be volumetrically printed, although biological specimens and volumetrically X-rayed objects (i.e., CT scans) are thought to be particularly well suited to this type of imaging. There are several methods for producing a volumetric print, the most common being an index-matched stack of hundreds of sheets of thin clear material (most often PMMA, also known as Lucite or acrylic). Each sheet in the volumetric stack is printed with a color slice of a digital 3D model, placed in a vacuum chamber, and then injected with a fluid matching the index of refraction of the sheet material. Volumetric printing has been called \\"Hologram 2.0\\" by a company marketing the technology. Volumetric prints however are not produced in the same manner as holograms, in that there is no interference pattern generated or used in basic volumetric prints.

You'resothrilling was trained by Aidan O'Brien and won the Cherry Hinton Stakes in 2007. Marvellous, who is You'resothrilling's first foal, is owned by Derrick Smith, Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor, and is trained by Aidan O'Brien. Racing career =2013: Two-year-old season= Marvellous made her racecourse debut on 9 October 2013, when she was one of fifteen runners in a one-mile maiden race for fillies at Navan. Jockey Joseph O'Brien held her up near the rear of the field in the early stages of the race. When the field had two furlongs left to run she had moved through the field to sixth place, before challenging the leaders in the final furlong. Marvellous took the lead near the finish and won by half a length from the Dermot Weld trained filly I'm Yours. =2014: Three-year-old season= Marvellous returned to the racetrack as a three-year-old for the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes, where she finished in sixth place, about four lengths behind stablemate Bracelet, who won the race. Marvellous then faced ten opponents in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at The Curragh, where she started at the price of 10/1 and was ridden by Ryan Moore. She was in the rear of the field for most of the race and was in last place at the halfway point. However, she closed the gap to the leaders to challenge for the lead inside the final furlong, before pulling clear to win by three lengths from pre-race favourite Lightning Thunder. Vote Often finished over four lengths behind the runner-up in third place. Marvellous's next race was the Oaks at Epsom Downs, where she was ridden by Joseph O'Brien and started as the 4/1 favourite. She raced near the middle of the 17-runner field in the early stages of the race. Marvellous made some progress, but could never get to the leaders and finished in sixth place, over eight lengths behind winner Taghrooda. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut * Marvellous is inbred 3 x 4 to the stallion Northern Dancer, meaning that Northern Dancer appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

The band released their debut album Loom on April 2014 through Kanine Records. A limited edition Record Store Day Vinyl was released on 19 April 2014. In 2016 they released their second album Fall Forever.  History  Fear of Men was formed in early 2011 by Jessica Weiss and Daniel Falvey. For her art degree, Weiss had been creating soundtracks for her short films and she met Falvey at one the exhibitions for her films. Falvey, a guitarist and a fellow art student, liked her recordings and they started working together. Weiss became the lead vocalist and lyricist, while Lin and Anthony joined on bass and drums respectively. In March 2011, they released a four- track cassette entitled the \\"Hannah Schygulla Demos\\" on the Sex is Disgusting label and began to perform live locally. In August the band released the single \\"Ritual Confession\\" on the Italian Beach Babes label. It was followed in December of that year by the \\"Alice Munro Demos\\" . Over the course of 2012 Lin was replaced by Robyn Edwards on bass, while they were joined by Michael Miles (ex Laish) drums. This created the core of Weiss, Falvey and Miles as a trio that recorded together while bass was added to the live-setting. In June 2012 they release the single \\"Green Sea\\" on the Sexbeat label. It was followed by the 7\\" \\"Mosaic\\" October on Too Pure. In February 2013, Kanine Records released a compilation of previous recordings as Early Fragments.

They preceded to go on tour in North America and Europe supporting The Pains of Being Pure At Heart. After the release of Loom, Weiss began composing new songs while experimenting with electronic sounds. The new material was played live during a short tour supporting Lower Dens in October 2015. This experience changed some of the material as the band \\"wanted to write an album that would make the stage shake, and we had to work out how we could sound stronger and get our ideas across in a more concise way\\". By the end of December 2015 the recording had been completed.  Style  In relation to recording the second album, Falvey commented that \\"We got a lot more interested in manipulating sounds and building songs with computers, but we had to learn how to combine that with our live performance\\".

The film stars Bobb'e J. Thompson, The Ranger$, Mike Epps, Luenell, Kristina DeBarge, Katt Williams, Tiffany Haddish, George Lopez, and Wilmer Valderrama. The film was released on July 2, 2014, in select theaters, VOD, and Digital HD. It is Cannon's directoral feature film debut. Plot The film opens with a news broadcast about a teenager named Jason Jackson being shot outside of the Monte Vista High School dance lock-in. Jason tells the story from the beginning, starting with him trying to get into the most popular dance clique in school, The Ranger$ (Langston Higgins, Julian Goins, and Dashawn Blanks). They say he has to pass the initiation of getting a pair of panties from one of the Sweet Gyrls by midnight. Jason then decides that he is going to attempt to get a pair of panties from his longtime crush Anastacia during the school's lock-in. Meanwhile, Day Day, one of the Ranger$ and Jason's older cousin owes Anastacia's eldest brother Junior $2,000 by midnight due to Day Day's father Darren telling Junior that Day Day would have his money after losing to him in a game of dominoes. In his English class, Jason gives Anastacia a poem he wrote about her after she forgets to do the homework assignment expect the teacher makes her read it in front of the class which everyone including Anastacia finds to be very great. After school is over, Anastacia gives Jason her number so they can write a song together sometime.

It depicts Mao Zedong and other Communist officials inaugurating the People's Republic of China at Tiananmen Square on October 1, 1949. A prominent example of socialist realism, it is one of the most celebrated works of official Chinese art. The painting was repeatedly revised, and a replica painting made to accommodate further changes, as the leaders it depicted fell from power and later were rehabilitated. After the Communists took control of China, they sought to memorialize their achievements through artworks. Dong was commissioned to create a visual representation of the October 1 ceremony, which he had attended. He viewed it as essential that the painting show both the people and their leaders. After working for three months, he completed an oil painting in a folk art style, drawing upon Chinese art history for the contemporary subject. The success of the painting was assured when Mao viewed it and liked it, and it was reproduced in large numbers for display in the home. The 1954 purge of Gao Gang from the government resulted in Dong being ordered to remove him from the painting. Gao's departure was not the last; Dong was forced to remove Liu Shaoqi in 1967. The winds of political fortune continued to shift during the Cultural Revolution, and a reproduction was painted by other artists in 1972 to accommodate another deletion. That replica was modified in 1979 to include the purged individuals, who had been rehabilitated. Both canvases are in the National Museum of China in Beijing.  Background  Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, Communists quickly took control of art in China. The socialist realism that was characteristic of Soviet art came to be highly influential in the People's Republic. The new government proposed a series of paintings, preferably in oil, to memorialize the history of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and its triumph in 1949. To this end, in December 1950, arts official Wang Yeqiu proposed to Deputy Minister of Culture Zhou Yang that there be an art exhibition the following year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party in China. Wang had toured the Soviet Union and observed its art, with which he was greatly impressed, and he proposed that sculptures and paintings be exhibited depicting the CPC's history, for eventual inclusion in the planned Museum of the Chinese Revolution. Even before gaining full control of the country, the CPC had used art as propaganda, a technique especially effective as much of the Chinese population was then illiterate. Wang's proposal was preliminarily approved in March 1951, and a committee, including the art critic and official Jiang Feng, was appointed to seek suitable artists. Although nearly 100 paintings were produced for the 1951 exhibition, not enough were found to be suitable, and it was cancelled. The Founding Ceremony of the Nation on exhibit along with artifacts of the October 1, 1949 ceremony. National Museum of China. Seen in 2018. The use of oil paintings to memorialize events and make a political statement was not new; 19th-century examples include John Trumbull's paintings for the United States Capitol (1817‚Äì1821) and Jacques-Louis David's The Coronation of Napoleon (1807). Oil painting allowed for a blending of tones to produce a wide range of realistic, attractive colors, in a way not possible with traditional Chinese ink and brush painting. Wang admired how, in Moscow museums, Lenin's career was chronicled and made accessible to the masses through artifacts accompanied by oil paintings showing crucial moments in the Communist leader's career. He and higher-level officials decided to use a similar technique as they planned the Museum of the Chinese Revolution. Thus, they sought to chronicle the Party's history and showcase its accomplishments. Paintings were commissioned, even though the museum did not yet exist and would not open until 1961. Chinese leaders were eager to be presented in paintings, wanting to be immortalized as central characters in the nation's historical drama. None of the works initially obtained for the museum depicted the crowning moment of the revolution, the ceremony at Tiananmen Square on October 1, 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic. Officials deemed such a work essential. Dong Xiwen, a professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) in Beijing, was accomplished and politically reliable, and had been present at the October 1 ceremony: he was an obvious candidate. Although Dong later complained that never in his career had he had full freedom of choice as to his paintings' subjects, The Founding of the Nation would make him famous.  Subject and techniques  Dong's original painting The painting depicts the inaugural ceremony of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The focus is on Mao, who stands on Tiananmen Gate's balcony, reading his proclamation into (originally) two microphones. Dong took some liberties with the appearance of Tiananmen Gate, opening up the space in front of Mao to grant the chairman a more direct connection with his people, something that architect Liang Sicheng deemed a mistake for a builder, but artistically brilliant. Five doves fly into the sky to Mao's right. Before him on Tiananmen Square, honor guards and members of patriotic organizations are assembled in orderly ranks, with some holding banners. Qianmen, the gate at the south end of the square, is visible, as is Yongdingmen gate (seen to the left of Mao). Beyond the old city walls that at the time enclosed the square (they were torn down in the 1950s), the city of Beijing is visible, and in green is represented the nation of China, with those further scenes under bright sunlight and sharply defined clouds. October 1 had been an overcast day in Beijing; Dong took artistic license with the weather. To Mao's left are seen his lieutenants in the Communist takeover. In the original painting, the front row, which is ordered by rank, consisted of (from left) General Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Madame Song Qingling (the widow of Sun Zhongshan), Li Jishen, Zhang Lan (with beard), and at far right, General Gao Gang. Zhou Enlai was furthest left in the second row, and beside him were Dong Biwu, two men whose identities are uncertain, and furthest right, Guo Moruo. Lin Boqu was furthest left in the third row. The leaders congregate close to each other, while remaining a respectful distance from Mao. This emphasizes his primacy, as does the fact that he is depicted as taller than his lieutenants. The point of view of the observer is well back on the balcony, from which most of the square would be obscured by the floor. Rather than show only Mao and sky, Dong manipulated the perspective, raising the horizon and intensifying the foreshortening of the balcony. Necessarily, only the officials and not the crowd below are represented as individuals; art historian Wu Hung wrote that \\"the parading masses in the Square derive strength from a collective anonymity. The combination of the two‚Äîabove and below, the leaders and the people‚Äîconstitutes a comprehensive representation of New China.\\" Mao and his officials are surrounded by lanterns, symbols of prosperity; the chrysanthemums on either side symbolize longevity. The doves represent peace restored to a nation long wracked by war. The new five-star flag of China, rising over the people, represents the end of the feudal system and the rebirth of the nation as the People's Republic. Mao, who is presented as a statesman, not as the revolutionary leader he was during the conflict, faces Qianmen, aligning himself along Beijing's old imperial North-South Axis, symbolizing his authority. The chairman is at the center of multiple, concentric circles in the painting, with the innermost formed by the front row of his comrades, another by the people in the square, and the outermost the old city walls. Surrounding them are the sunlit scenes, envisioning a glorious future for China with Mao the heart of the nation. Dunhuang murals of the Tang Dynasty. Although Dong had been trained in Western painting, he chose a folk art style for The Founding of the Nation, using bright, contrasting colors in a manner similar to that of New Year's prints popular in China. He stated in 1953, \\"the Chinese people like bright, intense colors. This convention is in line with the theme of The Founding Ceremony of the Nation. In my choice of colors I did not hesitate to put aside the complex colors commonly adopted in Western painting as well as the conventional rules for oil painting.\\" Artists in the early years of the People's Republic, including Dong, sought to satisfy Chinese aesthetic tastes in their works and so depicted their subjects in bright original color, avoiding complex use of light and shadow on faces as in many Western paintings. By European standards, the painting's colors are overly intense and saturated. The color vermilion was used for large areas of the columns, the carpets, and the lanterns, setting a tone for the work. The blooming flowers, the flags and banners, and the blue and white sky all give the painting a happy atmosphere‚Äîa joyful, festive air, as well as giving \\"cultural sublimity\\", appropriate for a work depicting the founding of a nation. Dong drew upon Chinese art history, using techniques from Dunhuang murals of the Tang Dynasty, Ming Dynasty portraits, and ancient figure paintings. Patterns on the carpet, columns, lanterns, and railing evoke cultural symbols. The colors of the painting are reminiscent of crudely printed rural woodcuts; this is emphasized by the black outlines of a number of objects, including the pillars and stone railing, as those outlines are characteristic of such woodcuts. Dong noted, \\"If this painting is rich in national styles, it is largely because I adopted these [native] approaches.\\"  Composition  Tiananmen Gate, photographed in 2009 The Founding of the Nation was one of several paintings commissioned for the new Museum of the Chinese Revolution from faculty members at CAFA. Two of these, Luo Gongliu's Tunnel Warfare and Wang Shikuo's Sending Him Off to the Army, were completed in 1951; The Founding of the Nation was finished the following year. These commissions were regarded as from the government and were highly prestigious. State assistance, such as access to archives, was available. At the time CAFA chose Dong, he was painting workers at the Shijingshan power plant outside Beijing. Dong reviewed the photographs of the event, but found them unsatisfactory as none showed both the leaders and the people gathered in the square below, which he felt was necessary. He created a postcard-size sketch, but was dissatisfied with it, feeling it did not capture the grandeur of the occasion. Taking advice from other artists, Dong made adjustments to his plan. Dong rented a small room in western Beijing above a store selling soy sauce. Jiang intervened to give Dong time and space to create the painting; the artist needed three months to complete his work. The room was smaller than the painting, which is four meters wide, and Dong would affix part of the canvas to the ceiling, working on his back. To save commuting time, he slept in a chair. He smoked cigarettes constantly as he worked. His daughter brought meals, but he was often unable to eat. Once the painting was under way, several of Dong's colleagues, including oil painter , came to visit. They decided that the figure of Mao, the central one of the painting, was not tall enough. Dong removed the figure of Mao from the canvas, and painted him again, increasing his height by just under an inch (2.54 cm). In painting the sky and the pillars, Dong used a pen and brush, as if doing a traditional Chinese painting. He depicted the clothing in detail; Madame Song wears gloves showing flowers, while Zhang Lan's silk robe appears carefully ironed for the momentous day. Dong used sawdust to enhance the texture of the carpet on which Mao stands; he painted the marble railing as yellowish rather than white, thus emphasizing the age of the Chinese nation. The leaders in the painting were asked to examine their portraits for accuracy.  Reception and prominence  When the painting was unveiled in 1953, most Chinese critics were enthusiastic. Xu Beihong, the president of CAFA and a pioneer in using realism in oil painting, admired the manner in which the work fulfilled its political mission, but complained that because of the colors, it barely resembled an oil painting. He and others, though, saw that the painting opened a new chapter in Chinese art development. Zhu Dan, head of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, which would reproduce the painting for the masses, argued that it was more a poster than an oil painting. Other artists stated that Dong's earlier works, such as Kazakh Shepherdess (1947) and Liberation (1949), were better examples of the new national style of art. Senior Party leaders, though, approved of the painting, as art historian Chang-Tai Hung put it, \\"seeing it as a testament to the young nation's evolving identity and growing confidence\\". Soon after the unveiling, Jiang wanted to arrange an exhibition at which government officials, including Mao, could view and publicly endorse the new Chinese art. He had connections in Mao's inner circle, and Dong and others organized it to be in conjunction with meetings at Zhongnanhai that Mao led. This was, most likely, the only time Mao attended an art exhibition after 1949. Mao visited the exhibition three times in between meetings and especially liked The Founding of the Nation‚Äîthe official photograph of the event shows Mao and Zhou Enlai viewing the canvas with Dong. The chairman stared at the painting for a long time and finally said, \\"It is a great nation. It really is a great nation.\\" Mao also stated that the portrayal of Dong Biwu was particularly well rendered. As Dong Biwu was in the second row, mostly hidden by the large Zhu De, Mao was most likely joking, but the favorable reaction by the country's leader assured the success of the painting. The Founding of the Nation was hailed as one of the greatest oil paintings ever by a Chinese artist by reviewers in that country, and more than 500,000 reproductions were sold in three months. Mao's praise helped boost the painting and its painter. Dong's techniques were seen as bridging the gap between the elitist medium of oil painting and popular art, and as a boost to Jiang's position that realistic art could be politically desirable. It was reproduced in primary and secondary school textbooks. The painting appeared on the front page of People's Daily in September 1953, and became an officially approved interior decoration. One English-language magazine published by the Chinese government for distribution abroad showed a model family in a modern apartment, with a large poster of The Founding of the Nation on the wall. According to Chang-Tai Hung, the painting \\"became a celebrated propaganda piece\\".  Later history and political changes  In February 1954 Gao Gang, the head of the State Planning Council, was purged from government; he killed himself only months later. His presence in the painting immediately on Mao's left placed arts officials in a quandary. Given its popularity among officials and the people, The Founding of the Nation had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition (1955), but it was unthinkable that Gao, deemed a traitor, should be depicted. Accordingly, Dong was ordered to remove Gao from the painting, which he did. 1954 revision, Gao Gang deleted In erasing Gao, Dong expanded the basket of pink chrysanthemums which stands at the officials' feet, and completed the depiction of Yongdingmen gate, in the original seen only in part behind Gao. He was forced to expand the section of sky seen above the people assembled in Tiananmen Square, which affected the placement of Mao as the center of attention. He compensated for this, to some extent, by adding two more microphones to Mao's right. Julia Andrews, in her book on the art of the People's Republic, suggested that Dong's solution was not entirely satisfactory as the microphones dominate the center of the painting, and Mao is diminished by the expanded space around him. The modified painting was shown in the 1955 exhibition, and in 1958 in Moscow. Although the painting was later altered again and does not exist in this form, this version is the one most commonly reproduced. When the Museum of the Chinese Revolution opened on Tiananmen Square in 1961, the painting was displayed on a huge wall in the gallery devoted to the Communist triumph, but in 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, radicals shut down the museum, and it remained closed until 1969. During that time, Liu Shaoqi, accused of taking a \\"capitalist road\\", was purged from government. His removal from the painting was ordered in 1967, and Dong was tasked to carry it out. Dong had suffered during the Cultural Revolution: accused of being a rightist, he was expelled from the Party for two years, sent to a rural work camp, and then was \\"rehabilitated\\" by being made to labor as a steelworker. Dong's task was difficult, as Liu was one of the most prominent figures in the first row, standing to the left of Madame Song. Officials wanted Liu replaced with Lin Biao, much in Mao's favor at the time. Dong was unwilling to give Lin prominence he had not then had, and though he could not refuse outright at the dangerous time of the Cultural Revolution, he eventually got permission to merely remove Liu. The figure was too large to simply delete, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to appear as if in the second row. According to Andrews, the attempt was a failure: \\"the new Dong Biwu does not recede into the second row as intended. Instead, he appears as a leering, glowing figure, a strangely malevolent character in the midst of an otherwise stately group\\". Officials deemed the revised work unexhibitable. Andrews speculated that Dong may have been trying to sabotage the change, or may have been affected by the stress of the years of the Cultural Revolution. The replica painting (1979 revision) In 1972, as part of a renovation of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, officials wanted to exhibit Dong's painting again, but they decreed that Lin Boqu, whose white- haired figure was furthest left, must be removed. This was because the Gang of Four, then in control of China, blamed Lin Boqu (who had died in 1960) for opposing the marriage, in the revolutionary days, of Mao with Jiang Qing (one of the Four). Sources differ on what took place regarding the painting: Chang- Tai Hung related that Dong, terminally ill with cancer, could not make the changes, so his student Jin Shangyi and another artist, Zhao Yu, were assigned to do the work. The two feared damaging the original canvas, so made an exact replica but for the required changes, with Dong brought forth from his hospital for consultations. According to Andrews, Jin and Zhao created the new version because Dong would not let anyone else alter his painting. Jin later stated that the painting, while effective politically, also shows Dong's inner world. With the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the subsequent accession of Deng Xiaoping, many of the purged figures of earlier years were rehabilitated, and the authorities in 1979 decided to bring more historical accuracy to the painting. Dong had died in 1973; his family strongly opposed anyone altering the original painting, and the government respected their wishes. Jin was on a tour outside China, so the government assigned Yan Zhenduo to make changes to the replica. He placed Liu, Lin Boqu and Gao in the painting and made other changes: a previously unidentifiable man in the back row now resembles Deng Xiaoping. The replica painting was restored to the Museum of the Chinese Revolution. The painting was reproduced on Chinese postage stamps in 1959 and 1999, for the tenth and fiftieth anniversaries of the founding of the People's Republic. Also in 1999, the museum authorized a private company to make small-scale gold foil reproductions of the painting. Dong's family sued, and in 2002 the courts found that Dong's heirs held the copyright to the painting, and that the museum only had the right to exhibit it. Joe McDonald of the Associated Press deemed the upholding of the copyright \\"a triumph for China's capitalist ambitions over its leftist history\\". In 2014, the art museum at CAFA held a retrospective of Dong's works, exhibiting the small-scale draft of the painting, possessed by Dong's family, for the first time. Fan Di'an, curator of the exhibition, stated, \\"The changes to the painting tell a bitter story, reflecting the political influences on art. But it didn't affect Dong Xiwen's love of art.\\" Visitors take photographs of The Founding Ceremony of the Nation, National Museum of China, in 2018 Wu Hung described The Founding of the Nation as \\"arguably the most celebrated work of official Chinese art\\". He noted that the painting is the only \\"canonized\\" one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze. The painting is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae, the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person. Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting \\"the most significant historical image of China's founding\\". Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel the changes that have come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance. Andrews wrote that \\"its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting\\". Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it \\"a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles\\". The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, \\"art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen\\". Art historian Michael Sullivan dismissed it as mere propaganda. Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the National Museum of China, on Tiananmen Square.

It was co- written and edited by Bobby Joseph,Jamie Clifton, \\"Did You Know Britain Had a 'Black Viz'?\\", VICE, 13 June 2014 and drawn by Daniel Francis, Joseph Samuels and Michael Robinson. It was published by Acreforce Ltd, a publishing label set up by publisher and BBC journalist Dotun Adebayo as an offshoot of X Press. Skank ended its run in March 1997, as a result of being sued by the runner Linford Christie over the cartoon 'Lunch-box Christie'. Joseph went on to found a new magazine, Black Eye, which he regarded as the successor to Skank. Content Skank was one of numerous comics similar to Viz. It has been dubbed the Ragga Viz or the 'Black‚Äô Viz. Paul Gravett has described it as \\"the first adult comic by and about British blacks\\". Skank examined the Black British experience in the 1990s. It pushed the boundaries of taste but also explored political satire, social commentary, sexism, homophobia, racism, and police brutality. Like Viz, Skank featured comic strips, photo strips, joke articles, and celebrity references. It featured popular comic characters satirising Black communities of London, such as \\"Mary Mampy\\" - a 'bad gyal' from Peckham; \\"The Fugitive\\", a baby father on the run from his numerous baby mothers; \\"Scotland Yardie\\" ‚Äì a Jamaican no-nonsense cop; \\"Rachel Prejudice\\" ‚Äì a subtle dig at Black sell-outs; \\"White Galfriend\\", a look at mixed race relationships; \\"Malcolm Vex\\", a frustrated revolutionary; and \\"Wendy Weave- on\\", a spoilt supermodel with baldness issues. Spoof news stories frequently appeared in Skank, such as ‚ÄòGovernment ban on Ugly Women‚Äô, 'Pubic Weave Extensions', 'Free Ganja competitions', and 'Yam Throwing - new Olympic Sport announced'. The magazine satirised the Brixton riots of 1981, and mocked Black celebrities such as Christie and the boxer Chris Eubank.

He is described as a king of Galicia, an ancestor of the Gaels, the son of Breogan, and the father of Milesius.Carey, John. The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory. University of Cambridge, 1994. p.13 The Lebor Gab√°la purports to be an account of the Gaels' descent from Adam through the sons of Noah and how they came to Ireland. The tale relates that the Gaels spent 440 years wandering the Earth and underwent a series of tribulations, loosely based on the tale of the Israelites in the Old Testament. Eventually, the Gaels sailed to Iberia and conquered it. There, one of their leaders, Breog√°n, founded a city called Brigantia and built a great tower. From the top of the tower, his son √çth glimpses Ireland. The Gaels‚Äîincluding some of Breog√°n's sons‚Äîsailed to Ireland from Brigantia and took it from the Tuatha D√© Danann, the Irish pagan gods. Brigantia likely refers to A Coru√±a in Galicia (which was then known as Brigantium)Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"A Coru√±a\\". and Breog√°n's tower is likely based on the Tower of Hercules (which was built at A Coru√±a by the Romans) or the Tower of Babel.

The company is known for its Wi-Fi video streaming cameras, Dropcam and Dropcam Pro, that allow people to view live feeds through Dropcam‚Äôs cloud-based service. On June 20, 2014, it was announced that Google's Nest Labs bought Dropcam for $555 million USD. In June 2015, Nest introduced the Nest Cam, a successor to the Dropcam Pro. Dropcam app users are also currently being transitioned to the Nest app. History Software engineers Greg Duffy and Aamir Virani founded Dropcam in 2009. Duffy served as Dropcam‚Äôs CEO and Virani served as COO. They originally developed software for cameras made by Swedish company AXIS. Wanting to develop a less expensive camera, the two companies parted ways and Dropcam started producing its own cameras that primarily provided video monitoring for homes and small businesses. Duffy and Virani credit Duffy‚Äôs dad with at least part of the inspiration for Dropcam. He wanted to identify the neighbor who was letting their dog poop on his lawn but they were having trouble finding a security camera that made it easy to record, stream and monitor large amounts of data. Dropcam received early funding from technology investor Mitch Kapor, and in June 2012, Dropcam secured $12 million in venture capital funding led by Menlo Ventures and previous investors, Accel Partners and Bay Partners. Dropcam has also received funding from Felicis Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The following year, it received $30 million more in funding led by Institutional Venture Partners, bringing the total raised to $47.8 million. Duffy said Dropcam‚Äôs revenue grew 500 percent year over year. Dropcam hosts cloud data through Amazon Web Services and Duffy says that Dropcam presently records more video than YouTube. Dropcam has become popular in families watching their children, through monitoring pets at home, at pet stores and in adoption centers. Users have also reportedly caught home-burglaries in progress. Duffy has said, ‚ÄúMoms are using it to catch their babies' first steps when they're not around, checking that older kids have arrived home safely; contacting children who are ignoring their cell phones; and sharing footage from birthday parties.‚Äù Due to the success of Dropcam, several companies launched similar products and services in 2014 and 2015, such as SpotCam and simplicam. In June 2015, the parent company Nest has introduced Nest Cam as a successor to Dropcam Pro.Nest Cam: Does It Replace Its Brother, DropCam Pro? Cloud Recording Dropcam provides optional encrypted digital video recording through the cloud. The Cloud Recording service automatically saves video on a rolling basis, so users can review the past week or month of footage, depending on their plan. All users, with or without the service, can still view the live feed. Dropcam allows users to download the video and create video clips while also allowing for the creation of a public stream. About 40% of Dropcam users sign up for the cloud service. As part of Dropcam's Cloud Recording service, markers are placed on a user's video timeline when motion or audio is detected, so a user may go back and view those specific events rather than watch the whole feed to search for notable activities. Dropcam introduced a beta version of its Activity Recognition feature for Cloud Recording, which learns typical motion patterns in a user's video stream, allowing for customized motion alerts.

The game primarily follows Luke fon Fabre, a teenager son of the Kimlasca King's sister who has suffered from amnesia ever since he was kidnapped. He encounters Tear Grants, a member of the Order of Lorelei who seeks the death of her brother, Luke's teacher Van Grants. As Luke and Tear meet and return to Kimlasca, they meet several other characters including Jade Curtiss from the Malkuth military forces, Fon Master Ion from Daath and his guardian Anise Tatlin. They are also joined by Kimlasca's Guy Cecil, Luke's servant, and Natalia Luzu Kimlasca-Lanvaldear, Luke's fianc√©. Another character who is briefly playable is Asch, a member from the Oracle Knights' God Generals who shares the party's goal of stopping an impending war. Creation and design The producer of Tales of the Abyss, Makoto Yoshizumi, commented the staff did not want a story where \\"the fated protagonist had a perfect life and a perfect upbringing, and he grew up to defeat the demon king.\\" They wanted a story with a party that consisted of flawed characters. All of the characters were designed by K≈çsuke Fujishima. Playable characters =Luke fon Fabre= :Voiced by (English): Yuri Lowenthal Voiced by (Japanese): Chihiro Suzuki is 17 and is the only son of a noble family in the kingdom of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear. After being kidnapped at ten years of age, Luke lost all of his childhood memories, and upon being returned home was confined to the safety of the Fon Fabre manor. His isolation from the rest of the world leads him to become a rather immature, selfish kind of person with next to no knowledge of the world. As the game progresses, Luke learns that he is actually an isofonically identical \\"replica\\" of Asch, the real Luke fon Fabre, and as such is also a perfect isofon of the Seventh Fonon itself. This event, along with the abandonment of his friends, prompts Luke to change himself for the better. Also along his journey, he falls in love with Tear. =Tear Grants= :Voiced by (English): Nicole Balick Voiced by (Japanese): Yukana , full name , is 16 and is a Locrian Sergeant of the Order of Lorelei in the Intelligence Division and is the sister of the primary antagonist Van. In the game's beginning she tries killing but upon crossing blades with his student Luke, a hyperrresonance occurs sending the two of them to Malkuth territory. While initially she escorts Luke back to Kimlasca, she becomes a recurring character as her superior, Mohs, orders her to go to Akzeriuth where Luke is also headed. She is extremely disciplined and feels compelled to be a soldier at all times, though she is sometimes unable to repress her feminine side which is often expressed in her interest in cute things. She is also a descendant of Yulia and can sing Yulia's Fonic Hymns. In moving the Outer Land to the Qluiphoth, she absorbs miasma which causes her body to be weakened and near dead. However, she is saved by Ion. She eventually falls in love with Luke who requested her to watch over him, and confesses her feelings to him at the end of the game. =Jade Curtiss= :Voiced by (English): Kirk Thornton Voiced by (Japanese): Takehito Koyasu , formerly known as Dr. Jade Balfour, is a 35-year-old colonel of the Third Division of Malkuth's Imperial forces. Jade is sarcastic, pessimistic, honest and logical. He is the creator of fomicry, a field of science that focuses on the creation of \\"replicas\\"; this earns him the nickname because of his former habit of extracting replica data from fallen soldiers on battlefields for experimental purposes. He is often tight- lipped when the subject of fomicry comes up. He is also very knowledgeable about fonic artes and has mastered the manipulation of all fonons but the Seventh, with which he has no proficiency. His younger sister and only living family member presumably is Nephry Osborne, the Governor of Keterburg. He is a close personal friend of Emperor Peony Upala Malkuth IX, and the former childhood friend of Dr. Saphir Ortion Gneiss, now Dist the Reaper who he has since come to despise. =Anise Tatlin= :Voiced by: Haruko Momoi , 13, is the guardian of Fon Master Ion, the highest official in the Order of Lorelei. She is a bright and cheerful little girl, but can sometimes show a darker side when provoked, and often hides her emotions when she is suffering. Because of her family's bad financial situation, she seeks to marry into money and as a running gag displays an interest in any possible way to obtain it. As a puppeteer, she can make her stuffed toy, Tokunaga grow to gigantic proportions and attack enemies. It is also revealed that she is spying for Mohs to pay off a debt that her parents owed him. This costs the life of Ion who dies from reading the Planet Score and greatly depresses her. Fujishima had no difficulties in designing the character after being told about her. However, her stuffed animal proved to be challenging to make. =Guy Cecil= :Voiced by (English): Johnny Yong Bosch Voiced by (Japanese): Yasunori Matsumoto is a swordsman in service to House Fabre. He is very loyal and brotherly towards Luke, and considers himself somewhat responsible for Luke's spoiled and selfish personality. Having more or less brought Luke up from a young age, he is usually the first person Luke turns to when in need of advice or guidance, and often ends up apologizing for Luke's shortcomings. It is revealed that due to repressed trauma, he is morbidly afraid of any physical contact with women. It is also later revealed that he is originally from Hod, and hence a citizen of the Malkuth Empire, that his real name is , and that Van Grants was his attendant as a child. Across the game, Guy stops seeking revenge for Hod's tragedy. He also moves back to Malkuth where he works under the orders of Emperor Peony and Jade. He specializes in Sigmund style swordsmanship, a school unique to Hod, and has a great interest in Fon Machines. Guy's clothing was based on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies the designer used to watch while making the character. =Natalia Luzu Kimlasca-Lanvaldear= :Voiced by (English): Stephanie Sheh Voiced by (Japanese): Michiko Neya , born , is the princess of Kimlasca- Lanvaldear who fully believes that the function of nobility is to tend to the needs of their subjects. She is 18 and is loved by her people for her various public works projects. As Luke's fianc√©e, she scolds him for his spoiled attitude and his dismissal of his duties as a noble. As the game progresses, it is revealed that Natalia is not the birth princess of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear ‚Äî the true princess was stillborn and was replaced with the midwife's daughter's newborn child. Natalia is initially branded a traitor to the kingdom through the machinations of Grand Maestro Mohs and is sentenced to death, but her people rally behind her. Eventually, her father realizes that even though they are not related by blood, Natalia is still his daughter. Natalia is dismayed to later learn that her biological father is Largo the Black Lion of the God- Generals. Upon finding out that Luke is in actuality a replica of Asch, she becomes conflicted about her affection towards him and appears to transfer most of them back to Asch. Natalia was difficult to draw as a result of the character designer having to show her adventurer side despite being a princess. =Asch= :Voiced by (English): Yuri Lowenthal Voiced by (Japanese): Chihiro Suzuki One of the Six God-Generals, , born and nicknamed , is the original Luke fon Fabre. He was carefully designed to be distinguished as different person from Luke despite sharing the same faces. After being kidnapped by Van, he is replaced by a replica while he joins the Oracle Knights under the alias \\"Asch\\", which he himself defines as \\"the remnants of the Sacred Flame\\" in reference to his belief that he was stripped of his original identity. Because of this, he harbors an intense hatred for Luke. Asch assaults Luke several times throughout the game, but cooperates with Luke's party in the latter half of the storyline, during which the player has the opportunity to control him in Luke's stead. Asch mostly prefers working alone, though he does contract the help of a band of thieves known as the Dark Wings. He is extremely short tempered and verbally abusive, especially towards Luke, who he frequently refers to as \\"dreck\\". He also has romantic feelings for Natalia, though he never admits it. Non-playable characters =Ion= :Voiced by (English): Erin Fitzgerald Voiced by (Japanese): Ikue ≈åtani (game), Yumiko Kobayashi (anime) The party of playable characters is accompanied by , also simply named , the leader of the Order of Lorelei, a neutral theocracy trying to calm the power struggle between Malkuth and Kimlasca-Lanvaldear. Though he is not a playable character, he accompanies Luke's party for most of the game. He is calm in most situations, and can utilize Daathic fonic artes, break Daathic seals, and read the Score from fonstones, all of which can easily tire him out. However, Ion is somewhat of a playable character, as he is one of Luke's Mystic Artes during the first half of the game. =Mieu= :Voiced by (English): Sandy Fox Voiced by (Japanese): Miki Maruyama is a small blue mammalian called a cheagle. He joins Luke's group when the elder cheagle exiles him for setting fire to the forest where ligers live, which causes the ligers to hunt the cheagles for food. Since Luke saves Mieu's life in a prior battle, the elder orders him to serve Luke for the time of one year much to Luke's displeasure. Cheagles are considered sacred by the Order of Lorelei due to a pact formed with Yulia Jue, symbolized by the Sorcerer's Ring. The ring enables cheagles to communicate with others, as well as use the power of various fonons to gain new skills. Although Mieu is often mistreated by Luke who calls him \\"Thing\\" he appreciates his master and takes the name \\"Thing\\" with honor. Later in the game and anime, Luke, who has vowed to change for the better, begins to call him by his proper name. Antagonists =Van Grants= :Voiced by: J≈çji Nakata , full name , is the main antagonist of the game, Luke's teacher and Tear's older brother. He leads both the Six God-Generals and the Order of Lorelei's main army. He was originally the servant of House Gardios until the island of Hod was destroyed. When Van learns that Hod's destruction was in the Score, and that the prediction had been kept secret, he begins to hate the Score and decides that a world with the Score must be destroyed, especially since he learns that score ultimately predicts Auldrant's destruction. Van soon discovers that replicas are born outside the Score's control and decides to make a world created entirely from replicated people and landscape, at the sacrifice of the original world and population. Van's most powerful subordinates are the although Asch leaves him when learning of his plans. Van is defeated by Luke's group in the end and falls to the Planet's Core where he obtains the Seventh Fonon. As he returns, he takes over the New Order of Lorelei. However, Van is once again defeated by Luke's group and dies. He is based on Oda Nobunaga. =Mohs= :Voiced by: Kaneomi Oya is the leader of the Maestros of the Order of Lorelei who is obsessed with fulfilling the Score. He attempts to start war between Kimlasca-Lanvaldear and Malkuth multiple times to fulfill the Score resulting in him being demoted. Nevertheless, he forces Ion to read the Seventh Fonstone at the cost of the Fon Master's life. He later uses Dist's power to make him Fon Master, at the cost of turning him into a hideous monster, and starts the \\"New Order of Lorelei\\", obsessed with keeping the Score. He eventually goes insane after finding that the score foretold Auldrant's destruction, and Luke's group is forced to kill him once and for all. =Legretta= :Voiced by: Miki Itou One of the Six God-Generals, is Tear's former instructor and formed a sisterly bond with her. She wields a pair of guns and is a brilliant strategist. She remains loyal to Van until the bitter end, and it later revealed to be in love with him (in spite of the fact that he killed her brother as predicted by the Score). In Legretta's final letter to Tear stating her motivations, she signs the letter with her true name, , and asks that Tear follow her own ideals and be happy rather than trying to live up to Legretta's example. =Arietta= :Voiced by (English): Kate Higgins Voiced by (Japanese): Satsuki Yukino One of the Six God-Generals, is a timid girl who was raised by ligers after losing her parents to the Hod war. She controls monsters and animals which aid her in battle and wishes to take revenge on Luke's party for killing the liger queen that raised her. She resents Anise for taking her place as Fon Master Guardian, unknowing that the original Ion whom she had fallen in love with had died and was replaced with the Ion that Anise was assigned to. It is revealed by Largo that Van deliberately refrained from informing her of the real Ion's death since it was believed that she would kill herself if she knew. She is killed during a duel with Anise after Ion sacrifices himself by using up too much of his strength while reading the Hidden Score. She is the first of the God-Generals to die causing Largo, who oversaw her duel with Anise, to swear to avenge her. =Dist= :Voiced by: Kazuki Yao One of the Six God-Generals, , formerly known as , is a socially awkward Fon machine specialist. He is often found seated in a flying chair, and throws a fit when he feels ignored (mostly by his fellow God-Generals) or is teased (mostly by Jade). Dist shared his childhood with Jade, and considers him both his rival and his closest friend. He prefers being called \\"Dist the Rose\\", and shows a bent for showmanship that goes largely unappreciated. In a contrast to the other God-Generals, he's very comical, though he's still a twisted individual that performs various experiments that disgust even Jade. =Sync= :Voiced by (English): Erin Fitzgerald Voiced by (Japanese): Ikue Otani One of the Six God-Generals, is a martial artist as well as the strategist for the Six God-Generals' missions. Because he is a replica of the original Fon Master Ion, he wears a mask to conceal his identity. Sync resents his existence because he was considered a failed replica (saying he was \\"born a piece of meat\\") and considers himself an empty vessel for Van's will, blaming the Score for what he considers his pathetic existence. He can perform Daathic Fonic Artes, though he has only a fraction of the ability of even the replica Ion. =Largo= :Voiced by: Tessh≈ç Genda is the oldest member of the Six God-Generals and leader of the Oracle Knights' shock troops. Formerly known as , is Natalia's biological father. Before becoming a member of the Oracle Knights, he was a mercenary for hire who chiefly took jobs providing security to travelling merchants. Because of the Score, his wife Sylvia was encouraged to give birth despite her weak health and her daughter was taken to replace the stillborn Kimlascan princess. The loss of her child pitched Sylvia into a deep depression, leading her to commit suicide before Badaq could return to Baticul after being contracted for an escort job. Having lost both his wife and child, Largo wandered until he met Van. Agreeing with Van's plan to destroy the Score, he cast aside his old life as a mercenary and even abandoned his daughter. Reception The cast of Tales of the Abyss has been well received by video game publications. Keza MacDonald from IGN stated that the majority of the characters were likeable. Richard Eisbeins from Kotaku praised the character development of Luke as well as the cast's characterization in general noting how viewers would be affected by the death of each antagonist. Game Informer would also list Tear and Jade on their list of the best characters in the series with the former praised on her fate and relationship with Luke while the latter on his characterization despite his tragic backstory. GameSpot's Ashton Raze referred to them as \\"an excellent cast of characters\\" centering more on Luke based on his traits that are both positive and negative. Additionally, Raze said that while the plot of the game becomes darker in contrast to its initial setup, the characters still remain appealing. GameSpy's Heidi Kemps said the cast was one of the \\"pros\\" of the game. However, he criticized the character models as they are \\"lacking in detail, with bland, monotone colors and a low polygon count\\". Aceinet from GameZone agreed with Kemps saying while in some parts they look well, in other time look \\"with choppy lines and bland textures\\". Despite noting some cliches within the cast such as Luke's mystery and fate, Eurogamer writer Dan Whitehead said that the main characters develop. Whitehead also praised the voice acting in the game. RPGFan's Christine Radler-Thomas shared the same opinions with Whitehead regarding the cast's development as well as their situation as most have no knowledge in regards to their situation. As Christian Nutt from GamesRadar criticized Luke due to how he annoys everybody (while noting it is almost naturally due his age), \\"when the first big plot twist hits, they take it out on him - too much\\". The reviewer found the cast as one of the best from Japanese role-playing games. In regards to the port's graphics Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central criticized them in a comparison to the ones from the PlayStation 2. Nevertheless, Kondolojy enjoyed the game's English voice acting. RPGamer's review by Alex Fuller of the cast was far more positive with Fuller saying \\"The exceedingly good handling of character development is easily Abyss' biggest storytelling strength\\" citing Luke's role as the main example. Like other reviewers, he praised the game's English actor citing Kirk Thornton's work as Jade. Nintendo Life noted how good was the characterization based on skits which served expand on them such as Guy's fear of women, Tear's love for anything \\"cute\\" among others.

She was best known for her interpretations of Lieder. Life Therese Behr was born to interior designer Carl Behr and his wife Lina Behr (n√©e Zenegg) in Stuttgart on September 14, 1876. In 1881, the family moved to Mainz. Therese Behr's brother, the conductor and violinist Hermann Behr, arranged for her to have music lessons in nearby Frankfurt am Main, with Julius Stockhausen; she studied with Stockhausen from 1893-95, and then continued in Cologne with Franz W√ºllner. She moved to Berlin in 1898 to study with Etelka Gerster. In 1900, the then-unknown pianist Artur Schnabel was hired to accompany Behr, who already had a successful international career, on a concert tour in East Prussia. The two married in 1905. They frequently performed together, and it was Behr's fame as a singer of Lieder‚Äîand her insistence that her husband accompany her‚Äîthat drew the public's attention to Schnabel's ability as a pianist. The Schnabels' twelve-room apartment on Wielandstrasse in Berlin-Charlottenburg soon became a meeting point for Berlin music circles. Behr also taught voice lessons in their home. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Behr and Schnabel left Berlin, as Schnabel very clearly foresaw the political troubles that were to come. For the next few years, they spent summers in Tremezzo, Lake Como, and winters in London. Summers in Tremezzo, for these years, were also an opportunity for Behr, Schnabel, and their son Karl Ulrich Schnabel to teach summer courses. The family relocated to New York in 1939, where Behr continued teaching. Behr returned to Europe for the first time in 1946, after the war. Thereafter, she spent summers in Switzerland and Italy. After Schnabel's death in 1951, she moved back to Tremezzo permanently, and remained there until her death in Lugano on January 30, 1959. Therese Behr's papers are held at the Music Archive of the Academy of Arts, Berlin. =Family= She married pianist Artur Schnabel in 1905. Behr and Artur Schnabel had two sons, the pianist Karl Ulrich Schnabel (1909‚Äì2001) and the actor Stefan Schnabel (1912‚Äì1999). Karl Ulrich Schnabel's daughter Ann Schnabel Mottier currently manages the Schnabel Music Foundationhttp://schnabelmusicfoundation.com/about-us/the-founders/ together with her husband Fran√ßois Mottier. Career Behr began her singing career as a student of Julius Stockhausen in Frankfurt am Main, and continued her musical education with Franz W√ºllner in Cologne. In 1898, at the age of 22, she moved to Berlin to study with Etelka Gerster. Her \\"tentative\\" first appearance in 1897 was followed by a second debut on January 21, 1899 at the Berlin Singakademie, accompanied by the Liszt student Alfred Reisenauer. This performance, which featured the music of Schubert and Brahms, was received very positively: the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung declared that \\"a genuine high priestess of the art has arisen once again.\\" The following years saw performances of Lieder in London, Paris, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Budapest, and Brussels, among others. In 1903, Behr co-founded the Berliner Vokalquartett (Berlin Vocal Quartet) with soprano Jeanette Grumbacher-de Jong, tenor Ludwig Hess, and bass Arthur van Eweyk. The quartet was renowned for its performances with orchestra of works such as Handel's Messiah and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Reviewer Wilhelm Kienzl wrote of the ensemble, \\"The characters of the four beautiful voices fit unusually well together, as if they had been selected with love and understanding from hundreds of singers by someone with a fine ear. Of course, the singers' own artistic intelligence and sense for style also play a significant part. Here, one has the result of sustained work, with which such a fine gradation of sound has been reached that one scarcely has the impression that four people are performing. And yet, despite all the humble subsuming of the individual to the group, the individuality of each artist can be recognized. The ensemble technique (rhythmic precision, dynamics, simultaneity of initial and final consonants) leaves nothing to be desired.\\" Kienzl had just one complaint: \\"It is regrettable that this elite quartet does not perform four-voice a cappella songs, such as old madrigals and motets. These would‚Äîeven because of the sound alone‚Äîbring some variety into the program.\\"\\"\\" Behr's and Schnabel's first encounter in 1900 was also the beginning of a lifelong musical collaboration. The two were known for their interpretations of the Lieder of Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms. Their concerts were described as exhibiting the \\"most subtle, finest taste\\"; in them, wrote reviewer Wilhelm Kleefeld, \\"serious will joined hands with the most perfect ability. These Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms evenings offered all participants hours of pure, unadulterated joy of sound.\\" In the winter of 1909/10, Behr and Schnabel performed Schubert's song cycle Die Winterreise. Schnabel's biographer Saerchinger remarked that \\"it was a hazardous undertaking for a woman to sing this intensely romantic song cycle, set to a series of poems which so obviously are the outpourings of a love-sick youth, and which in the realistic public's mind called for a man's voice.\\" Nonetheless, the concert was met with such acclaim that the duo performed all Schubert's song cycles over the next few years. They repeated this feat in the Schubert centennial year 1928 in concerts that critic Alfred Einstein described as \\"the highest possible integration of interpretative powers applied to deep and sincere feeling.\\" The duo performed not only works by established German masters, but also Schnabel's own songs for voice and piano, many of which were dedicated to his wife. After the birth of her sons, Behr appeared in public less frequently, accompanied almost always by her husband and, later, her son Karl Ulrich Schnabel. Behr taught throughout her life. Her students include Doda Conrad, Tilla Durieux, Eva Le√ümann, Hilde Ellger, Gertrud Hindemith, Sabine Kalter, Lotte Leonard, Peter Pears, Maria Stader, Erika Stiedry-Wagner, Mary Simmons, and Randolph Symonette. Reputation Behr was widely recognized for her rich voice and her \\"instinctive sense of phrasing and emphasis.\\" Wilhelm Kienzl wrote that she \\"treated her soft, beautifully balanced mezzo-soprano [sic] with artistic refinement.\\" Her voice inspired Richard Strauss to compose his song \\"Traum durch die D√§mmerung\\" (1895) for her. Behr was best known as a singer of Lieder, but she was also acclaimed as a soloist with orchestra; her early career saw performances with conductors Arthur Nikisch, Felix Weingartner, and Richard Strauss. British writer and friend of the family Edward Crankshaw wrote, \\"There are not many people who have the least idea either of the wonderful musicianship of Therese Behr Schnabel, ... or of the debt her husband owed to her. She was older than he by several years, and it was she who, after his infant prodigy days, forced him on the German public by insisting he appear as her accompanist. She had the most unerring musical tact of anyone I have ever known, and this came out in her singing even when she had no voice left at all.\\" Discography The sole recording of Behr from the height of her career is a private acoustic recording from 1904: *Symposium label CD 1356 A few other recordings from the 1930s exist; these recordings were made well past the height of Behr's career: *The Schnabels ‚Äì A Musical Legacy, Unpublished and Lost Historic Recordings.

Ulmer and starring Nancy Coleman, Margaret Lindsay, Phillip Reed, and Regis Toomey. It centers around a woman who falls in love with a soldier. Believing she has been abandoned, she gives her baby to her married sister. The picture was produced and distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation. The screenplay was by Anne Green from the novel Dark Angel by Gina Kaus. Plot During World War II, Toni Dubois meets soldier Dick Connolly at Pepe's. They have breakfast there the following day, and Dick proposes to Toni, who decides to wait until six weeks have passed before meeting again to see if they truly love each other. However, during the six weeks pause, Dick's leave gets canceled, and Toni believes she was a one night stand because the letter he wrote to her explaining his leave situation becomes lost. Toni decides to visit her sister Renee, who is married to Bill Gordon. When Bill is shipped overseas, Toni reveals she is pregnant from her one night with Dick. As Renee and Bill are unable to have their own child, Renee asks if she can have the baby and tell Bill it is hers. Toni gives birth to a boy, who Renee names Billy. Renee takes the child and Toni agrees not to see little Billy for another three years. Two years later, Toni stays home with her ill father, Mr. Dubois. Mr. Dubois tells her to not stay home when he dies. When he passes, Toni leaves and heads to Renee's, where she learns from housemaid Etta that Bill and Renee have gone out of town for a while. Toni attempts to take Billy away but Etta stops her. When Bill and Renee return home, Etta tells them of what happened. Meanwhile, Dick is discharged from the army, and he comes to Renee's house looking for Toni. After he leaves, Renee tells Toni that Dick was at her house. Toni insists upon taking Billy back, but Renee refuses, stating that Billy has become her son after two years. Toni tries to take Billy away again, but Billy runs away from Toni in fear, causing Toni to accept that Bill and Renee will raise Billy. Bill reveals that he knew the truth about Billy's birth, and thanks Toni for allowing them to raise him. Cast Production Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer, Her Sister's Secret was produced by Henry Brash and written by Anne Green. It is based on the novel \\"Dark Angel\\" by Gina Kaus. Working titles for the film were Between Two Sisters and Once and For All. The film was produced by Producers Releasing Corporation. They increased their usual film budget for Her Sister's Secret, referring to it as their \\"first million-dollar production\\" in advertising. Release and reception Producers Releasing Corporation released the film in September 1946. The New York Times wrote of the film, \\"In fashioning Her Sister's Secret as their first million-dollar production, the film makers at PRC may have been imbued with the theory that soap operas not only affect a lot of people but also sell soap and make money. For the romantic drama, which came to the Gotham yesterday, follows the pattern set by many of those lachrymose radio offerings\\" and said that \\"The sets of \\"Her Sister's Secret\\" are neat and interesting, attributes, which, sadly enough, can hardly be applied to its story.\\" A reviewer for the Northwest Chicago Film Society opined the film was \\"a superb melodrama\\" and that \\"you won‚Äôt soon forget Her Sister‚Äôs Secret.\\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker remarked that \\"the actors are hardly charismatic, but Ulmer, capturing their frozen energy in the shifting perspective of daringly long takes, infuses them with his rhapsodically compassionate vision.\\" Brody also wrote that \\"Edgar G. Ulmer cuts loose with a wild creativity that yoked his theatrical imagination to a keen view of the traumatic times,\\" and that Ulmer \\"wrings the last drop of true emotion from every soap-operatic twist, while also baring the domestic scars of war‚Äôs violence, sacrifice, and, above all, silence.\\" Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars, saying that it was a \\"fair weeper with competent cast.\\" In 1947, the film was banned in Ireland by Richard Hayes for featuring an unwed mother, a decision which was eventually reversed by the Appeal Board. This reversal was described by Irish film historian Kevin Rockett as \\"an indication of the slightly more flexible approached being adopted in the post-war years by the Appeal Board.\\" Preservation The film was restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive, with funding provided by The Film Foundation and The Franco-American Cultural Fund. A fine-grain was recently struck from the original nitrate negative, from which a new negative and superb new print were produced. Among other earlier exhibitions, the new print was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in November 2014.  References  * External links  * 1946 films Films directed by Edgar G.

The Vindelici were a Celtic people in antiquity. Their territory was known to the Romans as Vindelicia, and its boundaries were to be the Danube and Germanic limes to the north, the Inn (≈ínus) to the east, Raetia to the south, and the Helvetii to the west. These lands today comprise northeastern Switzerland, southeastern Baden, and southern W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria. Their chief town is assumed to have been the oppidum at Manching before the Romans. After the Roman conquest, the tribe's capital was moved to Augusta Vindelicorum (\\"Augusta of the Vindelici\\", modern Augsburg). Overview Most modern scholars consider the Vindelici to have been Celts albeit with a heavy mutual influence of their non-Celtic neighbours, the Raeti. The Vindelici's material culture was part of the La T√®ne culture commonly associated with the Celts. Little of the language of the Vindelici has survived, although place names suggest that they most probably spoke a variety of Gaulish, like the neighbouring Boii and Taurisci (also called Norici). One possible etymology of \\"Vindelici\\" is the Celtic prefix *windo-, cognate to Irish find- 'white'.

The Augustan inscription of 12 BC on the Tropaeum Alpium mentions four tribes of the Vindelici among the defeated: the Cosuanetes, Rucinates, Licates, and Catenates. Towards the end of the 1st century AD, the region of the Vindelici was included in the province of Raetia. Horace alludes to them in his fourth book of Odes,Odes, iv. 4 describing the eagle's first flight, a long metaphor that reveals itself at last as a compliment to Drusus: :videre Raeti bella sub Alpibus :Drusum gerentem Vindelici\\"So the Vindelici young Drusus saw/ Leading war home to their own Rhaetian Alps\\" in Bulwer-Lytton's translation.

He is known for playing the saxophone along with producing funk, electro-soul, and self- described future-funk.  Early life  Kwiecinski was born and raised in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. In elementary school, Kwiecinski was first introduced to the alto sax as well as the piano. After growing up on big horn sounds of funk groups like The Meters, Kwiecinski found himself gravitating towards that influence when he first began making his own music in college. He attended Birmingham Groves High School and then Michigan State University for several years before he dropped out to focus on a music career.Brian McCollum, \\"Griz finds the funk in electronic music's future\\", Detroit Free Press, May 19, 2015. It was also during his college years that he had become personally comfortable enough to openly identify as gay. While at Michigan State he would frequently DJ parties at his friends' fraternity houses and play shows in the East Lansing area. GRiZ first became popular with the release of his free debut album, End of the World Party, in 2011. With the release, he ended up supporting bigger artists such as Bassnectar, Pretty Lights, Gramatik, and Big Gigantic on their respective tours, eventually leading to his own headlining tour. Following such success, GRiZ released five more albums, Mad Liberation in 2012, Rebel Era in 2013, Say It Loud in 2015, Good Will Prevail in 2016 and Ride Waves in 2019. Griz currently resides in downtown Denver and Downtown Detroit.  Career  Kwiecinski created the All Good Records (formerly Liberated Music) label to promote his music, along with electro contemporaries Muzzy Bearr (who also plays guitar live with GRiZ and on several tracks), The Floozies, The Geek x VRV, and Manic Focus. All Good Records describes itself as a label that \\"reps old school motown soul, future funk, new disco, cutting edge electronica, and anything on the forefront of new sound.\\" Kwiecinski travels across the U.S & Canada playing at festivals such as Summer Camp, Electric Zoo, Electric Forest, Hard Los Angeles, TomorrowWorld, North Coast Festival, Decadence, SnowBall, Lollapalooza and Shambhala. He has collaborated with other artists, including Gramatik, ExMag and Big Gigantic. His fourth album, Say It Loud, was released on March 31, 2015. 12 Days of Grizmas, an annual event hosted by Griz, is intended to generate attention and revenue for non-profits. During the twelve days leading up to his annual 2-day festival in Detroit called GRiZMAS, all proceeds generated from events are donated to a variety of charities, and fans are often rewarded for their participation.  GRiZFam and Liberators  The GRiZFam started out as a way of fans of GRiZ to connect with each other through music, pictures, and other associated art. Liberators are the street team for GRiZ, and help raise awareness for shows, spread the music, as well as help with charitable organizations. The fans work by the mantra that GRiZ popularized: Show Love, Spread Love.  Awards, nominations and accomplishments  In 2013, GRiZ made top reviews in publications such as Detroit Music Magazine, SPIN, and The Untz, who put GRiZ as the \\"#1 Breakout Artist of 2013.\\" At the 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup in Denver, Colorado GRiZ won the People's Choice Flower category for the strain GRiZ Kush created in collaboration with Native Roots Apothecary. In December 2015, GRiZ, The Liberators and All Good Records were awarded the 'Spirit of Detroit' for the 12 Days of GRiZMAS campaign that raised over $30,000 for Little Kids Rock. The initiative found the Boulder-based artist leading a 12-day series of charitable activities in his hometown, from collecting coats for the homeless and bringing supplies to dog shelters to spreading Christmas cheer throughout the economically depressed city via free shows, industry panels and a \\"Night Before GRiZMAS\\" benefit warehouse concert.

Career =Ulster= Though he also played amateur rugby for Belfast Harlequins and Banbridge, Porter's first professional rugby club was Ulster. Porter came through Ulster's academy system, playing for the Under-19 and Under-20 sides, and in 2009 was nominated for the province's 'Academy Player of the Year' award. In January 2010 it was announced that Porter was among nine players who had signed contracts with Ulster, meaning he would play for the senior side starting in the 2010‚Äì11 season. He made his full debut for the senior side on 11 September 2010 in the 2010‚Äì11 Celtic League, coming off the bench against Italian side Aironi. He also featured off the bench against Edinburgh and Cardiff Blues. However, having started off the season as second choice to Paul Marshall at scrum-half, the signing of Ruan Pienaar saw him drop to third choice and Porter finished the season with just three league appearances, all as a replacement. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Porter continued as third choice, making five replacement appearances in the 2011‚Äì12 Pro12, the league having been renamed. Porter took a one-year sabbatical from playing the following season and did not feature for Ulster, returning in 2013. He returned from his long absence with an appearance from the bench against Newport Gwent Dragons in the 2013‚Äì14 Pro12 on 6 September 2013. Porter made his first-ever senior start for the province the following week against Glasgow Warriors. Porter left Ulster at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. =Connacht= It was announced in May 2014 that Porter had agreed a deal Ulster's Irish rivals Connacht.

His performance at Makongo was followed by placement on the Serengeti Boys Under-17 team. Kaseja signed with Moro United F.C. prior to the 2000-2001 season in Tanzanian football. He played his first two seasons completely, but was banned by the Tanzania Football Federation when he left to participate in the Gothia Cup, a youth football tournament based in Sweden. After the events at Morogoro, the goalkeeper transferred to Simba S.C. in the Tanzanian Premier League. He became an active member of the team beginning from 2009. On November 11, 2013, Kaseja was signed by Young Africans S.C., who were playing in the top tier of Tanzanian football as well.

Early life and education  Born in 1963 Leigh Ann Curl was the second of six children. As a child she excelled in sports and was known as the tomboy of her Pittsburgh neighborhood in Pennsylvania. Women in sports was atypical for a young girl at that time but her parents were highly supportive of her athletic interests. Her mother, who grew up playing basketball, was an especially big source of inspiration and would sometimes surprise her by taking her to watch the Pittsburgh Pirates. Devastatingly for Curl, her mother died from a cerebral aneurysm during her freshman year of high school when Curl was only 14 years old. This was an especially difficult time for Curl who attributes her interests in sports and more specifically her teammates and coaches to getting her through that difficult time in her life. = Athletics at University of Connecticut = Curl excelled both academically and athletically and was accepted to the University of Connecticut on a basketball scholarship. She had an affinity for the sciences and studied biology, chemistry and physiology before graduating summa cum laude in 1985 as class valedictorian. She was also a four-year starter for the University of Connecticut Women‚Äôs basketball team and served as team captain for two years. In addition she is also recognized as one of the all-time leaders in points and rebounds at the University of Connecticut. Career Although it was not firmly a part of her plan, Curl applied to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine after strong encouragement from her academic professors. She was accepted and completed her doctorate of medicine in 1989 and went on to complete her internship and residency at Johns Hopkins University as well. From there her decision to go into Orthopedic Medicine was predestined. Even today women are few and far between in the field of orthopedics and in fact out of 120 medical students in her class she was the only woman to go into orthopedics. Her decision often came into question by skeptics who undermined her capabilities as a woman. She was often asked if she was physically able of doing the work or if she was concerned about being able to get married and have a family. However she never gave anyone room to question her and championed on confidently to complete a fellowship in sports medicine and shoulder surgery in 1995 from Cornell University. During the yearlong fellowship she worked as a team physician for the New York Mets, St. John‚Äôs University and NYC public schools and recreation program. Following her fellowship she became an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and sports medicine at the University of Maryland Medical System. During this time (1997-2002) she also served as the head team physician for the University of Maryland Terrapins and was a volunteer physician for Johns Hopkins University and also for both the USA Women‚Äôs Rugby and basketball teams. It was also during her time at the University of Maryland that Dr. Curl became acquainted with the Baltimore Ravens. She was recruited to be the head team Physician for the University of Maryland by a colleague and orthopedic surgeon she met in New York during her fellowship. She also happened to be the head team physician for the Ravens and later after she had left her position she was offered a job with the team. It was also during her first year as team physician that the Ravens went to the Super Bowl. As a team physician, Dr. Curl is responsible for players who get injured during games or practices.

Although this is the highlight of her career she spends the majority of her time seeing patients and teaching medical students and residents.

He attained renown in his time as both a lawyer and a journalist,Smith at 12 (describing Hammond as \\"a famous man in his time, who conferred honor upon two professions, and left the world richer for his having lived\\"). but was largely neglected later.Weisenburger at 338 (explaining that \\"[a] century after his life and work ... [Hammond's] name is practically unknown except to well- informed journalists and historical specialists; and to most of these his personality and achievements may seem blurred and indefinite\\"). Hammond is best known today for his role as the intellectual leader of Ohio's ultimately failed opposition to the Second Bank of the United States.Ellis at 149 (identifying Hammond as \\"the leading figure among the antibank forces\\" in Ohio).  Early life and education  Charles Hammond was born on September 19, 1779 to George and Elizabeth (n√©e Wells) Hammond. The family lived in Baltimore County, Maryland at the time of Hammond's birth, but moved to Brooke County in western Virginia (now in West Virginia) in 1785. After a very brief (two-day) attempt at learning the printing business in 1798, Hammond began studying law under Virginia lawyer Philip Doddridge in 1799.  Career  Hammond received his license to practice law in Virginia in 1801, and later that year acquired a license to practice in the Northwest Territory. In November 1801, he was appointed as prosecuting attorney in Belmont County, Ohio. In 1804, Hammond moved to Wheeling, where he lived, practiced law, and wrote newspaper essays for five years. He returned to Belmont County in 1809. In 1813, Hammond began publishing a newspaper, the Ohio Federalist, in St. Clairsville, Ohio. That same year, Hammond was elected to a position in the Ohio Senate, serving a two-year term until 1815. Hammond was elected to the lower house of the Ohio legislature in 1816, and re-elected in 1817, 1818, and 1820. Hammond did not play a very prominent role as a legislator until controversy arose between Ohio and the Second Bank of the United States. This controversy thrust him into prominence for the next several years. Together with John Crafts Wright, Hammond represented Ohio and Auditor Ralph Osborn in the litigation that followed on the state's forcible collection of state taxes from the federal Bank. The high-stakes legal wrangling lasted from late 1819 until early 1824, when it came to end with a loss for Hammond in the Supreme Court of the United States in Osborn v. Bank of the United States. Hammond played an important role in the 1824 presidential campaign of Henry Clay - who had been opposing counsel representing the federal Bank in the litigation with Ohio. Hammond was nominated for a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court in 1822, but was rejected by the Ohio legislature. He was appointed official reporter for the Ohio Supreme Court and held that role until he retired from the practice of law in 1838. Near the close of his administration, John Quincy Adams offered Henry Clay a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Clay declined, and the seat was offered to Hammond, who also declined. Hammond became the editor of the semi-weekly Cincinnati Gazette in 1825. Until his death in 1840, Hammond published a steady stream of commentary on law, politics, and public affairs.See generally Weisenburger. Speaking of him decades later, William Henry Smith, who coordinated and managed the Associated Press, described Hammond as \\"the most distinguished American editor of his day.\\"  Personal life  Hammond married Sarah (Sally) Tillinghast in 1803. Charles and Sally had a daughter, Almer (b. Oct. 12, 1813), and a son, Henry. They remained married until Sally's death in 1826, which followed a seven-year period of poor health. Some years later, he married again. Of his second wife, Weisenburger says only that she was \\"a sister of Thomas and Moses Moorehead of Zanesville.\\"  Death  Charles Hammond died on April 3, 1840. He was memorialized in a poem by his assistant editor at the Gazette, William D. Gallagher, which included the lines: :A keen perception of the right, A lasting hatred of the wrong, :An arm that failed not in the fight, A spirit strong, :Array‚Äôd him with the weak and low, No matter what the opposing pow‚Äôr :And gave a terror to his blow In battle's hour. :He asked no leader in the fight; No ‚Äútimes and seasons‚Äù sought to know; :But, when convinced his cause was right, He struck the blow. :Praise to his virtues!‚Äîgreenly keep The memory of the race he ran! :Ne‚Äôer let the LIVING LESSON sleep Of such a man!

He was the last surviving original Navajo code talker who served in the United States Marine Corps during the war. Early years Nez was born in Chi Chil Tah, New Mexico, to the Navajo (Black Sheep Clan) of the (Sleeping Rock People). He was raised during a time when there were difficult relations between the U.S. government and the Navajo Nation. His mother died when he was only three years old. Nez recalled children often being taken from reservations, sent to boarding schools, and told to not speak the Navajo language. At eight years old, Nez was sent to a school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. His English given name, Chester, after US president Chester A. Arthur, was assigned then. It was from one of the government-run boarding schools, in Tuba City, Arizona, that Nez was recruited into the Marine Corps. Code talker Nez kept his decision to enlist from his family. He and 28 other Navajos formed Recruit Training Platoon 382 at Marine Corps Base San Diego in May 1942. The 29 who graduated from boot camp, including Nez, were then assigned to the Camp Elliot, California, where they were tasked with creating a code for secure voice tactical (battlefield) communications. At the time, tactical radios were not equipped, as they are today, with encryption/decryption technology, allowing the enemy to listen to radio traffic, often with disastrous results. The Navajo language was chosen because its complex syntax and phonology made it exceedingly difficult to learn as a second language, and it had no written form. Nez stated the developers used everyday words, in order to easily memorize and retain them. In 1942, he was among the code talkers to be shipped out to Guadalcanal, where they worked in teams of two: one to send and receive, the other to operate the radio and listen for errors. Nez also fought in Bougainville, Guam, Angaur and Peleliu. He was honorably discharged as a private first class in 1945 and returned to serve stateside in the Korean War from which he was discharged as a corporal. Post-military life At a press conference with Judith Avila. From 1946 to 1952, Nez attended the University of Kansas to study commercial arts, but by 1952 discontinued his studies after having exhausted funding from his G.I. Bill; he was awarded an honorary bachelor's degree by the Kansas University College of Liberal Arts and Science on Veterans Day, 2012. Following his military service, he worked as a painter for 25 years at a V.A. hospital in Albuquerque. In 2011, he wrote the memoir Code Talker: The First and Only Memoir by One of the Original Navajo Code Talkers of WWII with Judith Avila. Congressional Gold Medal On July 26, 2001, Nez was one of the five living code talkers who received the Congressional Gold Medal from President George W. Bush: Death Nez died on June 4, 2014, from kidney failure in Albuquerque, aged 93. References External links Marine Corps Heroes: Pvt.

He is Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Plant Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he taught from 1961 until 1999. As Professor Emeritus since 1999, Govindjee has continued to be active in the field of photosynthesis through teaching and publishing. He is recognized internationally as a leading expert on photosynthesis. Early life and education Govindjee was born in Allahabad, India. He is known only by a single name, as his family by tradition did not use a surname. At University of Allahabad, he received his B.Sc. in 1952 and his M.Sc. in 1954. He studied at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, earning his Ph.D. in 1960. He began his PhD work with Robert Emerson who discovered the Emerson effect. After Emerson died in a plane crash, Govindjee completed his PhD work in biophysics with Eugene Rabinowitch. He has written about both Emerson and Rabinowitch. Career Govindjee has made pioneering contributions to the field of photosynthesis‚Äîfocusing on the function of Photosystem II. He showed, in 1960, the role of Chlorophyll a in Photosystem II; pioneered the first picosecond measurements on Photosystem I in 1978 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and then on Photosystem II in 1989 with Michael Wasielewski at Argonne National Laboratory. He is best known for establishing the unique role of bicarbonate in electron and proton transport in Photosystem II. Govindjee has not only provided the first comprehensive theory of thermoluminescence in algae and plants, but has shown how prompt and delayed fluorescence of Chlorophyll a can be used as a signature of various reactions in photosynthesis. He is the founding Series Editor of the Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration as well as the Editor of Historical Corner of Photosynthesis Research. He has written extensively on the topic of Photosynthesis, including on the role of chlorophyll in Photosynthesis, light absorption, excitation energy transfer, and how plants make oxygen. Honors and awards Govindjee is the recipient of several awards and honors. He was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1976. In 1979, he was elected a Fellow and Life Member of the National Academy of Sciences, India. In 1981, he was elected President of the American Society for Photobiology. He was the first recipient of the Lifetime Achievement award from the Rebeiz Foundation for Basic Research, the 2007 Communication Award of the International Society of Photosynthesis Research, and the 2008 Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 2013, in honor of his 80th birthday, a tribute to Govindjee's life's work in photosynthesis appeared in Photosynthesis Research. In 2016, he received the Dr. B.M. Johri Memorial award of the Society for Plant Research, India. In 2018, Govindjee was elected as the Pravasi (Foreign) Fellow of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, India, and in honor of his 85th birthday, a special issue of Photosynthetica was released. In 2019, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign published an article on his research in photosynthesis and his \\"Photosynthesis Museum\\".

Both brooches are circular in shape, made from sheet silver and inlaid with niello and gold. The Strickland Brooch is decorated with highly complex zoomorphic patterns that are deeply carved within the quatrefoil, whereas the Fuller Brooch is ornamented in a more anthropomorphic style. In the case of the Strickland Brooch, the design includes a series of Trewhiddle style dogs interspersed between canine-like heads. History of ownership For a long time, the brooch belonged to the Strickland family of Yorkshire. Sold by Mrs W. H. Strickland at a Sotheby's auction in 1949 to an American buyer, it was denied an export licence and was acquired by the British Museum in the same year.

History The Soci√©t√© des observateurs de l'homme was founded on Christian principles by Roch-Ambroise Cucurron Sicard, Louis-Fran√ßois Jauffret and Joseph de Maimieux. The brevity of its existence and relative dearth of records provide scant history, but they did leave traces of their involvement with feral child Victor of Aveyron, as well as the Baudin expedition to Australia. The Constitution of the Society was set at its inaugural meeting in the Rue de Seine, August 1799. There they brought together naturalists, physicians (including psychiatrists), philosophers, writers, historians, linguists, orientalists and archaeologists under the chairmanship of John de Maimieux. Louis-Fran√ßois Jauffret, at whose home they met, was named permanent secretary. In 1800, the Society offered a 600 franc prize for study of very young children with an eye toward discovering the extent to which their physical, intellectual, and moral faculties are supported or opposed by the influences of the objects and people in the child's environment. The Society went silent in 1804, and was largely forgotten until the time of the French Third Republic, when Paul Broca of the Society of Anthropology of Paris cited the existence of the Observateurs in his claim that French anthropological societies predated those of Great Britain, which were then in ascendency.

Recuero et al. attached the name Pseudacris regilla to the northern species, renaming the central species the Sierran tree frog (Pseudacris sierra) and the southern piece the Baja California tree frog (Pseudacris hypochondriaca). Because the paper provided no maps or discussion of how to diagnose the species, it has been an extremely controversial taxonomic revision,Dodd, C. K., Jr. 2013. Frogs of the United States and Canada. Volume 1. xxxi + 460. but has been incorporated into Amphibian Species of the World 6.0. The taxonomic confusion introduced by this name change means that much of the information about Pseudacris hypochondriaca is attached to the name \\"Pseudacris regilla\\". Cultural importance Because this species of chorus frog is found near Hollywood, its vocalisations have frequently been used as stock sounds for film and television. As a result, its distinctive advertising call of \\"ribbit, ribbit\\" has become a standard representation of frog vocalisations, both in the United States and in the English-speaking world more widely, despite the fact that only it and a few closely related species actually make the sound.

In his travels in secretive Tibet (back when it was illegal for Western foreigners to visit there), he hears tales of a hidden underground city, a world of highly initiated beings led by the \\"Prince of Light\\". Illion finds a guide to take him there, and in the city he meets a fraternity of monks and their mysterious leader. Although he initially feels that he is in a place of great spiritual power, it slowly dawns on him that these people are really sorcerers that practice black magic, and had become soulless over time as the darkness spiritually consumed them.

She suggests that under the pseudonym of Illion may lie someone who studied the stories of the famous explorer.Laura Knight-Jadczyk, Darkness Over Tibet, The cassiopaea: \\"I next checked the chronology of events in terms of David-Neel's travels, and realized that the Illion book was written precisely during the period when Alexandra was ensconced in France, writing and lecturing widely. In fact, this book came out immediately after she had returned from her long treks in Tibet and had settled down for a period. That struck me as an interesting item. I thought that it was possible that this T. Illion was a student of hers, or even a nom de plume of either herself or her sidekick, Lama Yongden. However, the fact that the book was written in German argues against it being either David-Neel herself, or her companion. So, if there is any connection, it would probably be a student or colleague. In any event, there are several reasons for suspecting some sort of connection between Illion and David-Neel.\\" The same author finds the story of Darkness Over Tibet somewhat \\"artificial\\", despite the presence of some elements that strike her as being factual rather than made-up.Laura Knight-Jadczyk, op. cit.: \\"Yet, I had to agree that the story seemed to be somewhat \\"artificial,\\" even if certain elements of it struck me as being factual in that, if they had been made up, a different and more satisfying resolution would have been given them.\\" In his book Lost Cities of China, Central Asia, and India (1998), David Hatcher Childress raises the possibility that Darkness Over Tibet is an alarmist novel under the guise of a travelogue.David Hatcher Childress, op. cit., p. 355: \\"[...] his book may be alarmist fiction disguised as a travelogue [..].\\" Physician and bibliographer J√ºrgen C. Aschoff highly doubts that Theodore Illion ever went to Tibet or even approached the borders of Tibet. His books are, in his eyes, \\"truly science fiction, a figment of the imagination.\\" He finds it incredible that Illion‚Äôs publications should still be read and cited in so many scientific articles and books on Tibetan medicine, although the author never mentioned a single line of published reference or renowned Tibetan doctor in support of his more than vague assertions.Wilhelm Alexander Unkrig, Hans Findeisen, op. cit., p. 166: \\"Der Arzt und Bibliograph J√ºrgen Aschoff h√§lt Illions B√ºcher und seine Tibetreisen f√ºr ¬´ Science Fiction ¬ª (vgl. seine Kommentierte Bibliographie zur tibetischen Medizin Ulm, Dietikon 1996, 195).\\"Annotated Bibliography of Tibetan Medicine, op. cit., article 759: \\"Illion, Theodor: Darkness over Tibet. 192 p., Rider & Co., London (1933).

The 16-track album was released on August 12, 2014. Watsky said in a YouTube video that he wanted the album to be a tribute to his parents, and that because of this, the album cover would be a photo of his father, poet Paul Watsky, and his cat, Saruman. He also explained that he would like his mother to be on an alternate cover. During this video, he also gave a preview of a song, entitled Hand Over Hand featuring producer and singer Anderson Paak. The album was preceded by the single Whoa Whoa Whoa, produced by Anderson Paak, Mr. Carmack, Mikos da Gawd, and Lo Def.  Content  In the final episode of his Watsky Wednesdays YouTube blog series before he left for Warped Tour, Watsky revealed a little information about the content of All You Can Do. He explained that he recently had a seizure and he had to go on epilepsy medications to try and avoid any future seizures, and that before he had the seizure, he had written a song about prescription medications, Tears To Diamonds. He said of the song, \\"I wanted to write a balanced song about how prescription drugs are necessary, but there's so much fucked up shit that goes on.\\" Topics he said he focuses on in this song include doctors getting kickback from the industry for prescribing these medications, the overprescription of medication, side effects, and that what would have been seen as a facet of somebody's personality 20 years ago is now being seen as medical disorders that are being highly medicated. He explained that he wanted to write this song because he felt like all the songs about the pharmaceutical industry are about how bad the industry is and that none of them balance it out with the fact that pharmaceuticals save some peoples lives. He also explained that he deals with the \\"London situation\\" on it, referring to the 30-foot stage dive off the lighting rig at the Warped Tour date in London in 2013, which left one man with minor injuries and another woman with a broken arm. He explained that he didn't speak on this too much because he didn't want it to seem like he was wallowing in it; he wanted to be able to address it but not let it consume the album. He said that the album was a tribute to his mother and father: His father, Paul Watsky, is on the front cover with his cat Saruman; his mother is on the back cover. He explained that it is not only a tribute to his parents but also the kind of music they listened to when they were growing up, which is why there is so much psychedelic artwork in the deluxe physical copy.  Singles  On June 10, 2014, the first single Whoa Whoa Whoa was released on iTunes. The video (starring Watsky, Jim Belushi, Chinaka Hodge, Bo Burnham & Julia Misaki) was also released on June 10, on Billboard.com. He explained in the final episode before his departure on Warped Tour for his vlog, Watsky Wednesdays, that his inspiration for Whoa Whoa Whoa was \\"to have a verbal flexing song\\", and he explained that he wanted this song as a song to be what Pale Kid Raps Fast was as a viral video. He explained that he wanted to make a song that included \\"elements of my personality and what I could do with wordplay, and had a catchy chorus. It's a song for people who feel like they're not getting their due respect from people.\\" He went on to call Whoa Whoa Whoa \\"a silly song that's trying to prove people wrong that doubt you.\\" The music video went on to reach a million views in the first ten days of its release on YouTube. It reached two million views in less than six weeks. On June 11, 2014, during the final episode before Warped Tour of his vlog Watsky Wednesdays, Watsky announced that the second single would be Ink Don't Bleed, featuring singer Anderson Paak. He said that the song is very different than Whoa Whoa Whoa. On Twitter on July 13, 2014, he said that the third single from the album would be the song Right Now featuring Lisa Vitale, to be released the following Tuesday. On Twitter on July 31, 2014, he said that he would be releasing his fourth and final single pre-album release, and it would be the title track All You Can Do, and later announced the song would be released on August 5. He also announced on his Facebook page that the album would be available for streaming on Rap Genius starting August 8 at midnight, eastern time.  Release  The album was available on iTunes and Spotify as well as a limited edition physical copy and limited edition double-disc vinyl. As of October 2019, the album has been removed from streaming platforms for unknown reasons. Chart performance The album debuted at number 33 on the Billboard 200, selling 10,000 copies in its first week.  Track listing  This track list was confirmed with the iTunes Pre-Order on June 10, 2014, the day the album was made available for preorder.

The film portrays the German Condor Legion which fought in the Spanish Civil War. Because of the Nazi- Soviet Pact, the production was halted after 15 days of film-shooting, on 25 August 1939, to avoid offending the Soviets who had supported the other side in Spain and who were negatively portrayed in the film. Karl Ritter's diary entry that day states that Hermann G√∂ring had called the Ufa studio to tell him to abort the film. The film is often confused with the full-length documentary film by Karl Ritter, IM KAMPF GEGEN DEN WELTFEIND (In the Battle against World Enemy #1), released on 15 June 1939 on the same subject. LEGION CONDOR was planned as a sequel to Ritter's highly successful 1938 feature film, POUR LE MERITE, also starring Paul Hartmann, Albert Hehn, Fritz Kampers, Carsta L√∂ck, amongst others. In August 2018 the long-lost Ufa film script was found in a used bookstore in Berlin. No copy of the script is found in any German film archive or institution. A monograph on the film has been published by William Gillespie. The book draws on the previously unpublished 1939 dairy entries about the film by Karl Ritter, kindly provided by the Ritter family. The book has been assigned and is 244 pages in length, with 38 B&W; and 4 colour plates, as well as 126 footnotes. The entire film script has been translated into English, and twelve never-before-seen Ufa press photographs from some of the film scenes shot before 25 August 1939, are reproduced from Austrian archives.

He currently resides in New York City. Early life Denis Ja≈°areviƒá was born in Portoro≈æ, SR Slovenia, SFR Yugoslavia on 19 October 1984. Ja≈°areviƒá‚Äôs interest in music began at the age of three, when his mother would catch him listening to American funk, jazz, soul and blues from his older sister‚Äôs cassette tapes. As he got older, he was introduced to hip hop culture and listened to artists such as DJ Premier, Guru, RZA and Dr. Dre. Career At the age of 13, Ja≈°areviƒá started producing hip-hop music using an early PC. He later began sharing his tracks through the online music store Beatport, which helped him gain a following in the United States and Europe. Beatport is what Ja≈°areviƒá cites as his gateway to emerging as an electronic artist and landing his first US agent, Hunter Williams. After Ja≈°areviƒá signed with his new agency, he moved to New York City and released his debut studio album Expedition 44 in July 2008, as well as his second studio album Street Bangerz Vol. 1 in December 2008. SB1 charted on Beatport's Top 100 Chill Out chart for six months. In an interview with Britt Chester, Ja≈°areviƒá said, \\"I didn't even expect the album to sell one track on Beatport, nothing else was sold on beatport except techno and house. When I dropped my album and it started selling, I was really surprised, since I'd never seen a hip-hop album sell on Beatport. So when it sold, I was like 'Wow!' These were hip-hop beats, but it was labeled 'Chill Out' on Beatport. People saw it and thought it was awesome good chill out music, which is fine for me. I didn't expect it at all, and I didn't expect someone to reach out to me as a booking agent.\\" A year after releasing his first album, Ja≈°areviƒá signed to the Pretty Lights Music label as its first new artist, which at the time consisted of only the electronic music producer Pretty Lights (Derek Vincent Smith). The label utilizes a fee- free music model, and Ja≈°areviƒá has stated his belief is that it is \\"morally right for music to be primarily free\\", and has been vocal about his history with digital piracy and how it has benefited his career in multiple ways. Ja≈°areviƒá cited his third extended play (EP) #digitalfreedom as having a theme involving \\"the fight against severe internet censorship bills\\" such as ACTA, SOPA and PIPA. In 2013, Ja≈°areviƒá announced his departure from the Pretty Lights Music label in order to form his own vanity record label named Lowtemp Recordings. The label's name is an abbreviation of \\"low temperature\\", which Ja≈°areviƒá has explained is meant to indicate that music from his label would be \\"cool\\", stating, \\"So from now on, if you think a song of mine is cool, you gotta say that shit's [from] Lowtemp.\\" Lowtemp now consists of artists Exmag (a side project of Gramatik), ILLUMNTR, Gibbz, BRANX, and Russ Liquid. In 2014, Ja≈°areviƒá reissued his first seven albums‚Äîincluding the Street Bangerz series, renamed as SB‚Äîon the Lowtemp label with new or updated artwork. On November 9th, 2017, Gramatik launched his own cryptocurrency, GRMTK, and raised the maximum amount of $2.48 million (7500 ETH) in under 24 hours during his GRMTK token sale in Zurich. He was among the first artists to 'tokenize' his intellectual property.

This was Miles Davis' first recording session for Prestige Records, for whom he would record many albums over the next five years, as well as his first credited appearance as leader on an LP album. Davis had previously recorded one session under his own name, with Charlie Parker's band, for Savoy Records in 1947 (available on First Miles), and three sessions with his nonet for Capitol Records over 1949-1950 (Birth of the Cool). It was also his first session with the young Sonny Rollins. After the session was completed, they would record one more track entitled \\"I Know\\" under Rollins' name, with Davis on piano. The Rollins track is available on the album Sonny Rollins with the Modern Jazz Quartet (PRLP 7029). Earlier in the same day, before his session at Prestige, Davis had also recorded a session as a sideman with Charlie Parker, for Verve Records, found on the Parker album Swedish Schnapps.Miles Davis 1950s session details, Miles Ahead: A Miles Davis Website, accessed June 4, 2014 The Miles Davis tracks, including \\"Blue Room\\", were also released on two 78rpm singles.Prestige 78rpm discography, the Jazz Discography Project, accessed June 4, 2014 \\"Blue Room\\" would later be part of Davis' second 10\\"LP Blue Period (PRLP 140), and all four tracks would be re-released on the 12\\"LP Miles Davis and Horns (PRLP 7025), after the 10\\" format was discontinued. * Prestige 734: Miles Davis - Morpheus / Blue Room * Prestige 742: Miles Davis - Down / Whispering References 1951 albums 1951 compilation albums Prestige Records compilation albums Miles Davis albums Dizzy Gillespie albums Kenny Dorham albums Prestige Records albums Albums produced by Bob Weinstock ","title":"Modern Jazz Trumpets"},{"id":"42969399","text":"Iskashitaa Refugee Network (previously known as the Iskashitaa Refugee Harvesting Network) is a grass roots organization based in Tucson, Arizona that partners with volunteers and local organizations to provide various supplemental services to refugees to complement those offered by resettlement agencies. The organization was founded by Dr. Barbara Eiswerth, who holds a Ph.D. in Arid Lands Resource Management, and is currently directed by Eiswerth. Iskashitaa has a number of programs designed to empower refugees and unite them with staff and volunteers from the community. A primary component of these programs is gleaning, or harvesting unwanted produce from property owners and commercial farmers. Over Iskashitaa's ten years of existence, gleaning efforts have grown from harvesting a few thousand pounds of fruit each year to over 100,000 pounds annually of fruit, nuts, and vegetables: a cumulative one million servings of local produce.  Meaning of Iskashitaa  Iskashitaa means \\"working cooperatively together\\" in the language of the Somali Bantu people, called Maay Maay. The spelling of Iskashitaa was chosen by Eiswerth, as there was no written representation of the Maay Maay language at the time of Iskashitaa's inception. In its early years, the name of the organization was spelled with an asterisk, as Iskash*taa.  People  Iskashitaa originally worked with Somali Bantus, but has expanded to work with refugee populations from around the world. These refugees and asylum seekers arrive from Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Russia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Syria.  History  Eiswerth worked as a researcher in Malawi villages, and wrote her dissertation there. Upon her return to Tucson, she noticed rotting fruit that had fallen from trees and began the harvesting work for which Iskashitaa is known. Her background in environmental science and land management combined with her experience in Africa inspired her to start the harvesting work for which Iskashitaa is known. \\"As an environmental scientist, the road to sustainability is using what we have right here,\\" she says. \\"We can do the right thing, which is not let food go to waste.\\" In 2002, Eiswerth launched a project through the Tucson Youth Work Enhancement program to educate local high school teens about food resources. Together, they mapped 162 homes with 296 fruit-producing trees. Unwanted fruit harvested from these trees was then distributed to local farmers' markets and soup kitchens. In 2003, Eiswerth recruited refugee students to participate in a project identifying locations of produce that was going to waste in Tucson, as she had with the high school students. The refugee youth harvested and redistributed this food. After organizing two more youth mapping programs, Eiswerth received a grant from the United Way of America to begin regularly harvesting with refugees. Since then, Iskashitaa has gathered about 400,000 pounds of produce that has been redistributed to thousands of Tucson residents experiencing food insecurity. Over the years, the organization has offered English and swimming lessons for refugees, cooking classes for the members of the community, sewing and craft circles, and catalog sales of the goods Iskashitaa refugees make.  Funding  Iskashitaa Refugee Network is an Arizona nonprofit. Iskashitaa is under the fiscal umbrella of St. Francis in the Foothills UMC., a federal 501c3, but is working to become an independent non-profit association. Iskashitaa's funding comes from a combination of donations, grants, and earned income through sales.  Objectives  Iskashitaa Refugee Network is a local nonprofit whose mission is to assist refugees on their journeys to fulfilled lives in Tucson, using food-based programming as an entry point to community. Iskashitaa's primary objective is to \\"empower refugees by creating opportunities to better integrate with the larger Tucson community while gaining skills that serve them in America.\\" The organization's programs utilize connections, sharing, and English language practice to attain this objective. Iskashitaa has built a networking community among Tucson area refugee volunteers and agencies that cooperate to make this mission possible.  Programs  Iskashitaa Harvesting Iskashitaa harvesters consist of an inter-generational group of refugees from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East as well as local Tucsonan volunteers. This group harvests roughly 100,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables each year from backyards and local farms. This produce is then redistributed to refugee families from many countries, food shelves, and other Tucson organizations that assist food insecure families, either for free or for a nominal price. Iskashitaa Cooking and Food Preservation Refugees teach other Iskashitaa volunteers and staff about their own cultural dishes, typically using food that has been harvested. These interactions intend to make refugees more comfortable in an American kitchen, and introduce Tucson locals to different cultures. Volunteers and program staff also teach refugees how to make preserved foods from their own families' traditions. Groups have prepared jams, jellies, preserves, Nepali spices, and juices, to name a few. Often, food products are sold at local stores to sustain the organization's work. English as a Second Language Iskashitaa offers ESL Classes to refugees, designed to work with every individual, regardless of education levels or diverse backgrounds, experiences, and languages. These classes focus on language acquisition and cultural exchange, and work to develop relationships between teachers and students, as well as assist in the acculturation process by introducing material based on life in the United States. Students often interact with Tucson locals through Iskashitaa's other programs to practice their new language skills. College students from the University of Arizona have also taught refugees, through the Honors Civic Engagement Team (HCET).  Publishing & Awards  Iskashitaa has been published in a number of local and national publications, such as the Arizona Daily Wildcat, Eating Well, Zocalo Magazine, and Sow What, a Girl Scouts of the USA handbook. Both Iskashitaa and its director have received several awards and recognitions for their work. In 2007, Eiswerth won Gardener's Supply Company's Garden Crusader Award, which awards the recipient $12,000 in cash and prizes for making a difference in their community. In 2008, Eiswerth presented her harvesting plan at a Faith- Based and Community Initiatives Roundtable. The documentary, \\"Iskash*taa: An Invitation to Community,\\" created by Eiswerth, won a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \\"Portraits of Compassion\\" award. Besides these, Eiswerth was named a National Finalist in Community for Sustainable Food, and also received the Baha'i \\"Vision in Action Award\\", the Church Women United's Human Rights Award, The Jewish Federation of Southern Arizona's Meyer and Libby Marmis Humanitarian Award, and Interfaith Community Services' Silver Spoon Award. Iskashitaa's work has also been recognized by the White House by the Community Based Initiative through a winning video in \\"Portraits of Compassion\\". In addition, in 2011 Eiswerth, one of the six recognized, was awarded the Hon Kachina Volunteer Award in the State of Arizona for her efforts as a community volunteer.

Each episode features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination contest, cooking food with ingredients found in a supermarket grocery store (\\"Flavortown Market\\") as Fieri poses unusual challenges to them. The winning chef of the episode can collect up to $20,000 in a shopping spree bonus round. The show often features chefs from Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, another show hosted by Fieri. The show Dessert Games was a short-lived spin-off. Episode format The set is laid out in the manner of a typical supermarket, whose 10 aisles are stocked with a wide range of foods that include fresh produce, meat/poultry, and frozen items. Each chef has his/her own station for preparing and cooking food. Three judges officiate in each episode, introduced by Fieri during the first round. In each round, Fieri assigns a dish (usually a general type such as \\"a fried feast\\" or \\"an upscale dinner\\") and issues one or more challenges that the chefs must fulfill. Challenge types include games or random drawings to determine ingredients that must be used, items or aisles being declared off-limits, and an upper limit on the total number/price/weight of ingredients. In the absence of any pertinent restrictions imposed by Fieri, the chefs have 30 minutes to collect their ingredients in one trip, using a standard shopping cart, and prepare/plate their dishes. They must cook and plate four servings (one for each judge and a fourth \\"beauty plate\\") before time runs out. At the end of each round, the judges taste and evaluate the dishes and select one chef to be \\"checked out,\\" or eliminated from the game with no winnings. On occasion, the chefs compete through only two rounds instead of the usual three and/or face two eliminations at the end of a single round. The last remaining chef advances to the bonus round, Guy's Shopping Spree, for a chance to win up to $20,000 in two minutes. Two different formats have been employed: * Seasons 1-11: The chef must retrieve one named item from each of the market's 10 aisles, receiving $2,000 for each item placed in the shopping cart. * Season 12 to Present: Fieri reads five clues, each of which can be answered with a particular item, and the chef receives $4,000 for each item placed in the cart. On occasion, such as during tournaments or specially themed episodes, Guy's Shopping Spree is not played and Fieri awards the full $20,000 to the winner. Challenges A wide variety of challenges and games are used in the show with new games added as the series progresses (and some games tweaked or changed a little). Some of the following games have been played once or twice while others have become familiar game staples. * 1, 2, 3: Chefs must prepare a specified ingredient in two different ways and may only shop in three aisles. * 2 for 1 Special: Played in the final round. Each chef must select one of three unusual ingredient pairings and use both items in their dish. * ABC Game: All ingredients must begin with the same randomly chosen letter of the alphabet. * Aisle Down: Not announced until the contestants begin shopping; the aisle containing one or more key ingredients for their dish is blocked off by police tape so the chefs must quickly find an alternative. * Basket Shop: Used when pairs of chefs are competing. Instead of shopping carts, the teams must collect their ingredients in hand-carried baskets, with each teammate holding one handle at all times. * Budget Battle: The contestants are given a set amount of money to shop for ingredients, and may take advantage of coupons or price specials throughout the market (and, in some episodes, to exchange items they are not using). Some episodes consist of a single Budget Battle spanning all three rounds; in this case, Fieri sets their total budget for all rounds before the first round, but chefs may apportion the money between rounds as they see fit, and can keep leftovers from previous rounds. * Cart/Station Swap: Used mainly in the final round, the two chefs must trade shopping carts or cooking stations, thus being forced to use each other's ingredients and/or work in progress. * Can Can: Contestants are only allowed to use canned food items in their dish. * The Claw: Announced mid-round, contestants have to play a claw game and grab a little plastic ball with an ingredient label on it. Inside is an undesirable version of that ingredient, which must be used in the dish. (E.g. a ball labeled \\"corn\\" might contain candy corn.) * Clearance Carts: Chefs must get all their ingredients from three carts filled with assorted odd items. * Closing Time: Mid-shopping, an announcement is made that the store is closing, limiting the time the chefs can spend in the aisles. * Divide and Conquer: Used when pairs of chefs are competing. A strip of tape divides the market in half from front to back, running along Aisle 5. The two chefs in each pair must shop on opposite sides of this line, but may call out suggestions and/or speak face-to-face in Aisle 5 as desired. * Express Lane: Chefs may use no more than a specified number of ingredients. A variation is Register Run, in which the first chef to reach the checkout aisle may use the full number of ingredients and each successive chef must use one fewer than the preceding competitor. * Flip This Dish: Contestants must use ingredients for one type of dish to create a totally different type, such as dessert ingredients being used in a savory dish. * Food Pyramid: Similar to the pricing game Plinko on The Price Is Right. A ball is dropped down a peg-covered pyramid to determine what ingredients or other restrictions, on three levels, the chefs must use in their dish. * Food Wheel: One or two wheels are spun to determine the game restriction like mandatory ingredients, which aisles to use, and/or food budget. The most common variation is the High/Low Food Wheel, in which Fieri spins one wheel consisting of expensive ingredients and a second one of low-end groceries; the chefs must use both items in their dishes. * Frozen Food Feud: The chefs are only allowed to use frozen items in their dishes. * Grocery Bowl: Chefs each roll one melon toward soda bottles labeled with ingredients or aisle numbers, and must use whatever they leave standing or knock down, depending on Fieri's instructions. On occasion, Fieri or one of the judges will roll an extra melon after the chefs have all taken their turns. * Grocery List: Each chef is given a list of items that must be incorporated into that round's dish (a mix of specific food items and more generic suggestions such as \\"something from aisle 6\\" or \\"something under $1.99\\"). Variations include Emoji List, where the ingredients are represented by emojis, and Ultimate Grocery List, in which the chefs are given a list of ingredients that they must use during the entire competition but may decide which ones to use in each round. * Jackpot Luck: Contestants pull a lever on a special slot machine and must use the three random ingredients that appear when the machine stops. * Keep It Sample: The chefs must incorporate at least two ingredients from four different sample tables located throughout the store in their dish. * Kiddie Carts: (Sometimes spelled \\"Kiddie Karts\\") The chefs must use child-size shopping carts to collect their ingredients in one trip through the market. * Let It Roll: The chefs roll a set of dice to determine the constraints for the assigned dish, such as required ingredients and equipment, budget, and shopping time. * Lunch Rush/Dinner Rush: The chefs' shopping/prep/cook time is reduced from 30 minutes to 20 (or 15, on rare occasions). * Meals from the Middle: Contestants can only use groceries from the middle aisles, which contain no fresh meat, produce, dairy products, or frozen foods. * Menu Magnet Madness: From three rows of refrigerator magnets, the contestants must each pick a flavor (sweet, sour, smoky, etc.), a protein (chicken, tofu, fish, etc.), and/or a style of dish (salad, stew, stir-fry, etc.). Variations of this game include a player choosing a combination for their competitor, players secretly choosing one magnet each and then revealing them to form a theme that all of them must follow, or Fieri choosing the last magnet himself (usually something that clashes with the other chosen items). * Musical Carts: Played in the final round. A song plays during the shopping phase; when it stops, the two chefs must abandon their own carts, find another one (usually an opponent's cart), and continue shopping. Each chef must then use some of the ingredients they did not choose in their dish, adhering to a minimum number set by Fieri. Variations on this game include switching to abandoned carts with some undesirable ingredients. * Name Your Number: Before the first round, chefs are each given three numbered cards. They choose one card at the start of each round to indicate the number of ingredients they intend to use for it; however, each number may only be used once. * No Carts Allowed: Contestants may only use the ingredients they can collect in one trip, without using a cart. They are allowed to use large items as carrying vessels for smaller ones, but may not put any items in their pockets or aprons. * No-Shop Showdown: Chefs are not allowed to do any shopping for the entire competition, but must instead use a cart full of groceries provided by Fieri at the start of the first round. * Odd/Even: Based on a coin toss, the chefs may only shop in either the odd or even-numbered aisles. A variation is Over/Under, in which the toss determines whether the chefs must only use items higher or lower than a randomly chosen price. * One Ingredient at a Time: Chefs may only get one ingredient per trip through the market, but may make as many trips as needed. * One Ingredient Per Aisle: Played in the final round. Chefs must take only one ingredient from each of the market's 10 aisles, and must use all the chosen ingredients in their dish. * Order Up Mash-Up: Played in the final round. Chefs separately choose one of several dishes (presented on diner order tickets) and must combine them into a single dish. * Out of Sight: Chefs are blindfolded and must choose an item from a large clearance cart that they will have to incorporate into their dish. * Out of Stock: After the chefs begin shopping, Fieri announces that a key ingredient they need for their dishes is out of stock, forcing them to devise an alternative. * Price Check: All ingredients used by the chefs must have prices that start (or sometimes end) with a number randomly chosen by Fieri. A variation is $[X] Price Check, in which the chefs may only use ingredients costing no more than a specified price. * Red Light/Green Light: Traffic lights change between red and green to indicate whether certain aisles are open or closed. * Red Light Special: During the round, one item in the store is marked with a sign and a flashing red light, and the chefs must get that item and incorporate it into their dish. The item is typically not associated with the assigned dish, such as beef jerky for a dessert. * Scavenger Hunt: Contestants are given a clue and must find the item that corresponds to it. That item has a clue which will lead them to another one in turn. They must collect a total of four items in this manner and use all of them. * Shoplift: The chefs are given oversized jackets or track suits to wear and must stuff all their ingredients into their clothing, without using carts. If Fieri spots a chef \\"stealing\\" ingredients in this way, they must unload everything they have taken and start again. In some episodes, Fieri brings in additional \\"security officers\\" to patrol the aisles with him. * Shop Swap: Used when pairs of chefs are competing. Teams are given a limited time to shop for ingredients; one member of each team shops during the first half, the other during the second half, and they may not speak to each other until time has run out. * Single Aisle Showdown: The chefs are only allowed to shop in one aisle specified by Fieri for the whole round. * Single Shop Showdown: The chefs must do all their shopping for the entire competition during the first round, but are not told at the time what dishes they must prepare in the second or third rounds. They must also adhere to a preset shopping budget. * Sliders: A version of shuffleboard where contestants push a disk with a long stick and must use the ingredient corresponding to where it lands. * Special Delivery: A mid-round game in which the chefs receive an unusual ingredient that they must use in their dishes. *Speed Shop or [X]-Minute Shop: The chefs are told at the outset how much shopping time they will have. * Split Shop: Used when pairs of chefs are competing. One chef writes down a list of items for the other to get from the market, but may not indicate what dish they have in mind; the shopper may change the list based on the dish they think their partner wants to make. * Spree Ball: A version of the arcade game skee ball. Each chef rolls an orange toward a target board to determine a constraint such as a required ingredient or a spending limit. More desirable results correspond to the higher, harder-to-reach targets. * Think Small: The chefs may use only the ingredients they can fit in a small shopping bag during one trip through the market. * Time-Out: Used mid-round when pairs of chefs are competing. One chef in each pair must leave the station and write instructions for the other on a chalkboard, without speaking. * Top Shelf/Bottom Shelf: A coin toss determines whether chefs may get ingredients from only the top or bottom shelf in each aisle. * Un-gredient List: After assigning the dish, Fieri lists several ingredients typically used in it and forbids the chefs from using any of them, forcing them to find substitutes. * Watch Your Weight: The chefs are given a weight limit for their combined ingredients and must weigh their choices on a produce scale in order to verify that they do not exceed it. * Wild Card: Each chef draws a card at random to determine an ingredient they must use. * World Fusion: Picking two flags out of a hollow globe, the chefs must combine two international cuisines into one cohesive dish. =Culinary quizzes= In addition to challenging games, the show featured culinary quizzes at times throughout the first 11 seasons. Each quiz referred to a specific item; the first chef to find that item and bring it to Fieri won an advantage for the current round, such as being allowed to get extra ingredients or enter an aisle declared off-limits. * Culinary Quiz: Identify an item based on a series of clues given by Fieri. * Culinary Close Up: Chefs are shown a close-up of a food item that slowly zooms out. * Grocery Pictogram: Chefs are shown a rebus of pictures that can be used to \\"spell out\\" a grocery item. * Know Your Varieties: Identify an item based on different names/varieties listed by Fieri. * Logo Lowdown: Fieri reads a series of clues about a brand name as its logo is slowly revealed on a screen. * Market Multiple Choice: Three choices are displayed on a screen, one of which is the correct answer to a question read by Fieri. * Vowel Play: The name of a product is displayed on a screen, with all vowels and any spaces between words removed; these are gradually filled in. * Word: Fieri reads clues about a food item and gradually reveals the letters in its name. Production Season 1 was shot inside of an actual grocery store, Field's Market, in West Hills, Los Angeles. For Season 2, the market was built in a 15,500 square foot warehouse in Santa Rosa, California. It was built over two weeks and stocked with over $700,000 of food. After each episode, the perishable items were donated to local food banks and scraps are donated to farmers. The casting process to get on the show is described as \\"surprisingly streamlined\\" with potential contestants conducting a Skype interview and submitting photos of their best dishes. Once chosen, a member of production will arrange travel plans and bring the contestant to California. Each episode takes up to 12 hours to shoot, with a large portion of that time devoted to off-screen interviews.

Wittmer and his wife are the figures under the arch. Johann Michael Wittmer (15 October 1802, Murnau am Staffelsee - 9 May 1880, Munich) was a German painter who came from a family of painters and sculptors and was associated with the \\"Deutschr√∂mer\\" (Germans artists and writers who lived in Rome). He is often referred to as \\"Johann Michael Wittmer II\\", to distinguish him from an earlier family member of the same name. Life His father died before his birth and he was raised by a step-father who was apparently not sympathetic to the family profession. In 1820, he used some hard-earned money to attend the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where he studied until 1828; first with Johann Peter von Langer, then Peter von Cornelius, who obtained work for him, assisting other artists with their commissions. These jobs enabled him to save enough money to go to Rome, although he had to walk there, by way of Venice and Florence. Once there, he joined his fellow Catholic Germans as a member of the Collegio Teutonico. Work was hard to come by, however, and his situation didn't improve until 1832 when, through the mediation of Count Franz Pocci, he was introduced to Crown Prince (later King) Maximilian of Bavaria. One of his first assignments was to accompany the Prince on a trip to Naples and copy the frescoes there.Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens (1833) The following year, he accompanied the Prince on a grand tour of the \\"Orient\\", visiting and painting numerous historical sites throughout Greece then, following a visit with Maximilian's brother Otto, on to Constantinople (Istanbul) where the Prince's influence enabled them to see parts of the Hagia Sophia that were not open to the public. Upon their return to Italy late in 1833, Wittmer was kept busy completing various projects for the Prince and his family, including a fresco at the Prince's castle in Hohenschwangau. =Later career= Portrait of Joseph Anton Koch (mid 1830s) Tragedy struck in 1835 when most of Murnau was destroyed by a fire, leaving his family's extensive collection of paintings and drawings lying in ashes. The year 1839 saw the death of his father-in-law, Joseph Anton Koch, who had been a major influence on his painting style. After that, he became more deeply involved in his work, devoting himself almost entirely to paintings with Christian motifs in the style of the Nazarene movement. When Maximilian (now the King) returned to Rome, he planned to have Wittmer accompany him on another trip, but it never materialized. The King's patronage continued, however, and Wittmer made trips to Bavaria almost every year after 1857, but turned down the offer of a professorship in Munich, preferring not to make his wife and children relocate. He became ill during a trip to Munich and died peacefully there shortly after his arrival. References  Further reading Georg Kaspar Nagler: Wittmer, Johann Michael.

Background  Shen Song was born in 863, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang. He was said to be from the Min region (i.e., the region of modern Fujian). His grandfather Shen Lu () was a judge at Tang's supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫, Dali Si). His father Shen Chao () served as the magistrate of Changxi County (Èï∑Ê∫™, in modern Ningde, Fujian), and Shen Song might have been born there.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 86. In 895, during the reign of Emperor Yizong's son Emperor Zhaozong, Shen Song went to then-capital Chang'an to submit himself for the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class. The minister of justice Cui Ning () was in charge of the imperial examinations that year, and he chose 25 examinees as having passed the examination, and Shen was one of them. However, for reasons unclear, Emperor Zhaozong then had the imperial scholar Lu Yi and the director of the archival bureau Feng Wo () conduct a second-round examination, which eliminated 10 examinees ‚Äî but Shen survived this round as well. However, Shen then headed home toward the Min region rather than remain to serve in the imperial examination ‚Äî perhaps because at that time, the Tang state was overrun with various disturbances. As he went through Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), the military governor of Huainan (should be referring to Yang XingmiSee Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 1.) invited him to serve on staff, but he declined. He proceeded to Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang), which was then under the rule of Qian Liu the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered at Hang). Qian kept Shen on staff to serve as secretary in his role as military governor of Zhenhai.  Service under Qian Liu  In addition to being Qian Liu's secretary, Shen Song was later also made Qian's deputy in Qian's role as the circuit's agricultural director. It was said that most of Qian's public declarations and communiques with other circuits were written by Shen. Tang fell in 907 and was, as to the central part of the empire, succeeded by Later Liang, which Qian's realm, which became the state of Wuyue, became a vassal to.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266.

Qian asked for Shen's thoughts about Li's era name Tongguang (). Shen responded, \\"Looking at this era name, the state would not be completed, as it only had one mouth\\" (referring to that Tong () lacked the enclosure of the character for \\"state\\" () and contained the characters of \\"one\\" () and \\"mouth\\" () inside it).  Service under Qian Yuanguan  Qian Liu died in 932, and was succeeded by his son Qian Chuanguan (who then changed his name to Qian Yuanguan). Qian Yuanguan established a Zeneng Institute () to select members of the intelligentsia to serve in the Wuyue state government, and he put Shen Song in charge of the institute.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. In 937 (by which time Later Tang had fallen and Wuyue was a vassal of its successor state Later Jin), Qian Yuanguan took the title of King of Wuyue (a title that his father Qian Liu had been bestowed but which he himself had not used up to this point), and he commissioned Shen, as well as Cao Zhongda and Pi Guangye, chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Todd Rigney. The October People picked up the distribution rights in 2014 after the film screened at various film festivals. Plot 12-year-old Marty tells the story of discovering his brother Steve is a serial killer when he took Steve‚Äôs bowling ball bag and discovered a human head inside. Each week, Marty finds a new head, usually of a black woman, inside the bag hidden in Steve‚Äôs closet. Marty keeps the discovery to himself, and immerses himself in a world of horror movies and comic books with his best friend David. A black classmate named Marcus bullies Marty at school. Marty refuses to fight back, which leads to a rumor that Marty tried to kiss Marcus. Marcus is given detention while Marty is sent home. Marty sneaks into his brother‚Äôs room but finds the bag is empty. He turns on Steve‚Äôs stereo and puts on Steve‚Äôs rubber gas mask. Steve enters and yells at his brother for being in his room. He then learns that his brother did not stick up for himself during his fight with Marcus. Marty‚Äôs mom takes Marty to the video store to rent movies for a sleepover with David. When he tries to rent an empty box for a strange movie titled ‚ÄúHeadless,‚Äù the clerk informs him that the tape is missing. Marty goes through his brother‚Äôs VHS collection and finds the tape of ‚ÄúHeadless‚Äù that was stolen from the store. Inside is a paper noting certain times from the film. Marty and David watch the unrated movie, which turns out to be so graphic that it makes Marty uncomfortable, knowing his brother uses it for inspiration. David criticizes Marty for being a baby and says that he no longer wants to be Marty‚Äôs friend because no one likes him. Upset, Marty forces David to look inside Steve‚Äôs bag, where they find Marcus‚Äô severed head. He tells him that if David tells anyone, Steve will kill him. Horrified, David gets sick and his mother takes him home. Steve realizes that his brother knows his secret and confronts him, demanding how much he knows. He threatens Marty to keep quiet and later confesses that he only kills black people out of hatred for their race. He pledges that he would never harm his little brother. Marty struggles with how to handle himself and his brother‚Äôs true nature. Marty attends a church service with his mother and ends up beating Trevor, a classmate, after Trevor bullies him. He refuses to apologize, claiming that he is only sticking up for himself when no one else will. When Marty returns home, his father begins striking him over the altercation at church. Steve starts beating his father and pushing his mother before his father kicks him out of the house. That night, Marty secretly meets with his brother outside. Steve asks for his help with an unspecified plan, but Marty refuses. As they argue, their father comes outside and Steve hits him with a shovel, and runs inside after his mother. Marty sees his brother preparing to rape their mother and tries to stop him, but is knocked unconscious. Marty awakens tied to a bed with a ball gag in his mouth. He hears his mother screaming and crying in another room. Steve enters naked and wearing his gas mask, tells Marty to be quiet, grabs a machete, and proceeds to kill their parents. He comes back into the room completely covered in blood. Steve tells Marty that he will explain everything in the morning, but Marty only cries. Marty‚Äôs reaction drives Steve mad. In the morning, Steve walks out of the house, still covered in blood. Marty wakes, still tied up, to find himself surrounded by the mutilated bodies of his dead parents.

The designation was later cancelled and the roadway was removed from the state highway system. Since December 15, 2006, Main Street has been under the control of the City of Grapevine. In 2010, with the DFW Connector Project in full force, constructors were planning to demolish the current Main Street bridge, and replace it with a new one to \\"ease up traffic below on the SH 114/SH 121 freeway corridor\\", planners said. This involved a detour along Texan Trail during the morning hours, which easily caused backups of traffic in the morning hours. The new bridge would have one extra lane on each side, to allow traffic to \\"flow along the bridge much easily than before\\". The entire project (also involved re- routing the freeway, adding toll lanes, and re-doing interchanges) was mostly completed in April 2014. Signage still says State Spur 103.

He was a saint of the people of Sindh, a warrior who fought battles against Abbasids, a ruler over Yemen and an explorer who travelled frequently. He was a Sayyid and a descendant of Ali and Fatimah through Ali al-Hadi. Inside View Of Shrine Muhammad Al Makki Birth and upbringing The father of the Sayyid was Abu Ahmad Muhammad Shuja. Sayyid Muhammad Shuja once left his native Mashhad with the intention of pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. On the way Sayyid Muhammad Shuja passed through Baghdad where he met Abu Hafs Umar al- Suhrawardi, after spending some time in his presence, Suhrawardi gave his daughter in marriage to Sayyid Muhammad Shuja. Proceeding to Mecca along with his wife, he found that his wife was pregnant and was in immense pain. Unable to bear the pangs of childbirth, the lady gave birth to Sayyid Muhammad in the courtyard of the Kaaba who was born in 1145 and the Islamic year of 540 AH. He later became well known as Muhammad the Meccan. Some scholars however disputed this marriage of Sayyid Muhammad Shuja to a daughter of al-Suhrawardi and have mentioned that it was Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki himself who married the daughter of al-Suhrawardi.Zulfiqar Ali K. \\"The Rizvi Saints of Sindh - Part. I Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki was taught the sciences of Islam by his father and brother, Sayyid Ahmad, who both ensured the young Sayyid was well trained to propagate and spread Islam in his wanderings. To fully understand the childhood of the Sayyid, it must be taken into consideration that he grew up in the era of the Crusades while he was brought up in the heart of Islam, Mecca. It shaped his psychology which eventually led to his interest in military training and his later military endeavors. In Yemen In 1174 AD, Turan-Shah, the brother of Saladin conquered Zabid and Aden in South Yemen and this eventually led to all of Southern Yemen being under Ayyubid control. Abbasids, who were allies of Ayyubids also gained influence in Yemen. Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki, who was now twenty-nine years old, entered Yemen from the North from his native Mecca. With the force of the sword, he killed many Abbasids, routing them away from Yemen. His hostility towards the Abbasid caliphate, is an Alid, as a result of the historical ongoing feud between Alids and Abbasids who on numerous occasions killed Alids wherever they were able, the Battle of Fakhkh and the murder of numerous ancestors are notable reasons. He ruled his province in Yemen for approximately ten years. Sayyid Muhammad decided to leave Yemen for Sindh and left a representative, claiming he saw his ancestor, the Prophet of Islam Muhammad in his dream instructing him to leave for India as it awaited him. The Sayyid then headed North and stopped at Medina, where he visited the grave of his ancestor Muhammad and other ancestors in Al-Baqi'. He then went to Mecca and sought refuge with the Kaaba. Eventually, it is said he had another dream of Muhammad instructing him to proceed towards India. In Mashhad Muhammad Al-Makki on his way to Sindh stopped at many places to camp. He first stopped at Baghdad, then Mashhad, then Herat and finally Sindh. When he stopped at Mashhad he visited the shrine of his forefather Ali al-Ridha at Mashhad. The Sayyid was very much attached to Mashhad for it was a city some of his ancestors lived in. He visited the library of his grandfather, Sayyid Ibrahim JawwƒÅdi, and remained in Mashhad. By the time he left the land of Iran, he had an army of 30,000 and led this army towards the land of Bukkur, fighting his way through native hostile armies of Khurasan and India who challenged him. In Sindh It is mentioned in many sources that Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki arrived in Bukkur at dawn. Delighted at the peaceful setting and beautiful view of the sun rising, he famously and joyfully exclaimed: \\"God has ordained my morning in this blessed place!\\" (Arabic: ! ÿ¨ÿπŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ®ŸÉÿ±ÿ™Ÿä ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÇÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ®ÿßÿ±ŸÉÿ©). Sayyid Muhammad also named this place 'Bukkur' from its former name 'Fareshta'. Upon being asked where he wanted to live by the welcoming natives he told them he wanted to live where the cowbells could be heard and the rising sun would be visible. Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki obtained a grant of land in Rohri with the condition expressed in the deed that he should cultivate the land in lieu of the military duties obligatory on all granted landowners. Due to the warlike nature of this tribe, they were entrusted by the authorities to prevent marauders and bandits from thieving and looting. Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki became a well-known saint whose preaching brought many people towards Islam. He established a centre of spiritual learning in Sindh and remained the religious figure of Sindh until the early 13th century. Death Muhammad Al- Makki died at the age of 101 in 1246 AD and 644 AH. He was buried in the fort of Arak between Sukkur and Bukkur His shrine is located near Deputy Commissioner Office Sukkur. Location of Shrine Of Muhammad Al Makki In Sukkur Grandfather Sayyid Ibrahim Al-Jawwadi was born in Mashhad in 1040 and died in 1132 during the era of the Seljuq dynasty and was the grandfather of Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki. Although Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki did not ever meet his grandfather, it is proven from sources that he inherited books and other items which belonged to Sayyid Ibrahim and it greatly influenced his upbringing in the realm of spirituality. He received books and journals relating to events in the life of Sayyid Ibrahim. It is mentioned in sources related to Bukkuri Sayyids that Sayyid Ibrahim had mastered fourteen Islamic sciences and was a very generous, hence he was nicknamed 'Jawwadi' or 'The Generous One'. It is mentioned that in the time of Toghril Beg, the Assassins group which was founded by Hassan-i Sabbah was causing havoc in the region and spreading bloodshed and plundering. Upset at this, Toghril came to Sayyid Ibrahim and asked him to pray. Sayyid Ibrahim went to the tomb of his ancestor Imam Ali al-Ridha and made a prayer while Toghril said ; 'Amen'. Shortly after it is mentioned that the Assassins had stopped murdering and plundering for a time. Sayyid Ibrahim was childless for a long time and was very upset at this. It is mentioned that he would frequently visit the shrine of Imam Ali al-Ridha and pray to God. One day, he lost patience and began to cry bitterly and became unconscious. Leaving the shrine happy, he told people that he saw Ali al-Ridha in his dream who told him; \\"Do not cry Ibrahim, Allah (God) will give you a child\\". Shortly after this event, the father of Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki, Sayyid Muhammad Shuja, was born. Father Sayyid Muhammad Shuja was an expert in the field of Hadith and Fiqh. He was also an expert in the arts of swordsmanship, archery, wrestling and on horseback. He was also very brave in battle which gave him the title of 'Shuja' or 'The Brave'. In 1132, a ruler in Iran, Sayfullah Khan and Turkey went to war. Sayyid Muhammad Shuja, who was then ruling Khorasan, was appointed in command of an army of 10,000 and fought the Turkish army in a mountainous region. Sayyid Muhammad Shuja then returned to Iran victorious after a bloody and lengthy battle. The king of Iran gave his daughter Safiyya Khat≈´n in marriage as a gift to Sayyid Muhammad Shuja. This was the first marriage of the Sayyid before the daughter of Suhrawardi. It has also been mention in ancient sources that the Sayyid also travelled to places including Karachi, Thatta and Lahore.

He was a pious Sayyid who was often known by his strength in his religion, keen interest in spirituality, and remembrance of God. He was instructed in a dream by the Islamic Prophet Muhammad to marry his daughters, Sayyidah Fatima Sa'eedah Habeebah and Sayyidah Tahireh to Jalaluddin Surkh- Posh Bukhari. However, since Jalaluddin was known to be someone who dressed like a poor person due to his spirituality and humility, the brothers of Muhammad Badruddin, Sayyid Mah, Sayyid Shams, and Sayyid Sadruddin objected to this marriage. When the objection was not taken into consideration by Sayyid Muhammad Badruddin, the brothers ordered his exile and the exile of Sayyid Jalaluddin from Bukkur. They said to Sayyid Badruddin, \\"You go as well and hang around with him (Jalaluddin) like a beggar\\". Sayyid Badruddin and his son in law, Sayyid Jalaluddin migrated to Uch where both are buried. Sayyid Badruddin's descendants are plenty in number. His descendants come from many sons including Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi who was born from the daughter of Alauddin Khalji and Sayyid Sa'adullah.

Harold Alexander (1900-1987) was the state chairman of the Florida Republican Party from 1952 to 1964. Alexander resided on the Gulf Coast in Fort Myers in Lee County, Florida. Political career Alexander's long chairmanship corresponded with the continued but weakening one-party system in Florida. From 1953 to 1955, he handled federal patronage in Florida through the new Dwight D. Eisenhower administration. He was among those known as \\"Post Office Republicans\\" whose principal interest in the party was to locate jobs as postmasters or in other federal positions for deserving party members. However, a new breed of Republicans began to appear in Florida as early as the 1950s; these Republicans were interested in recruiting and registering voters, campaigning against Democrats, and winning elected offices. Such a figure was William C. Cramer, a native of Denver, Colorado, who moved to St. Petersburg as a youth with his parents. In 1950, the World War II veteran was elected to the Florida House of Representatives from St. Petersburg. After a loss for the United States House of Representatives in 1952 on the Eisenhower ticket, Cramer won the congressional position in 1954 by a narrow margin. He soon found that Alexander \\"did his best to put me in my place\\" though Cramer was the first Florida Republican to serve in Congress since 1883. According to Cramer, Alexander accented patronage under his control, rather than GOP voter registration drives or the recruitment of candidates.Billy Hathorn, \\"Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970,\\" The Florida Historical Quarterly, LXVII, No. 4 (April 1990), pp. 406-407, 410 However, Alexander claimed an interest in campaigning. In 1955, he attended a \\"campaign school\\" for state chairmen held in Washington, D.C.. There he conferred with Vice President of the United States Richard M. Nixon. Alexander was a delegate to the 1952, 1960 and 1964 Republican National Conventions. In 1964, after nine years in the House, Cramer was elected in the primary as the Florida Republican national committeeman, a position that he held for twenty consecutive years. Cramer also headed the presidential delegate slate pledged to U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona though his former law partner, Herman Goldner, later the mayor of St. Petersburg, was supporting U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Cramer said that Goldwater asked him to circumvent the party \\"regulars\\" led by Harold Alexander's successor, chosen in 1964, Tom Fairfield Brown, Sr. (1926-2012) of Tampa, because the state leadership had been too passive for too long. Cramer said that the state committee had \\"never been really interested in electing Republicans\\" and had \\"ignored Republicans when they were elected.\\" Edward J. Gurney, a transplanted New Englander who settled in Winter Park and was elected to the U.S. House in 1962, initially joined Cramer and the insurgents but then withdrew his backing. Goldwater tried to \\"marry\\" the two slates, but Cramer said that Brown made such demands that no merger was feasible. Republican strategist Richard Kleindienst of Arizona halted a scheduled appearance on behalf of the Cramer slate by Goldwater's two sons. The Brown forces narrowly won the primary, but Cramer said that the insurgents may well have prevailed had Goldwater not wavered in his position. Cramer said that he believed the Brown forces would have \\"sold out\\" Goldwater had the \\"Stop Goldwater movement\\" been strong enough to coalesce behind Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, a late- announcing candidate prior to the 1964 convention in San Francisco.

Early years Pierre Marec was born in Brest, Finist√®re, on 31 March 1759. When the revolution began in 1789 he was a control clerk in the navy at Brest. In 1790 he became deputy attorney of the commune, then general secretary of the department of Finist√®re. On 14 September 1791 he was elected deputy for Finist√®re in the Legislative Assembly, but was not called upon to serve there. Deputy Marec was reelected on 7 September 1792 to represent Finist√®re in the National Convention. Marec sat among the moderates. He wrote a decree for the expenses of the Navy department, and handled several technical issues competently. At the trial of King Louis XVI of France he supported the appeal and opposed the death penalty. On the third nominal appeal he voted for imprisonment of Louis during the war and perpetual exile afterwards. Marec was a member of the Finance committee and the committee of the Navy and Colonies. He addressed the Convention several times, mostly on commercial issues. At the Thermidorian Reaction (27 July 1794) Marec spoke against Robespierre. He joined the Committee of Public Safety, and moved to release the Duchess of Orleans, Prince de Conti and other suspects. He distinguished himself among the opponents of the revolt of 1 Prairial Year III. He denounced Joseph Fran√ßois Laignelot and opposed the establishment of a new maximum. Later career Marec was elected to the Council of Five Hundred on 22 Vend√©miaire year IV for three departments. He continued to press for reforms in naval recruitment. Under the First French Empire he was appointed inspector of the port of Genoa, which he held until the convention of 23 April 1814. During the Hundred Days, in April 1815 he was named inspector of the port of Bordeaux, but did not take up the position. After the second Bourbon Restoration he retired in 1818. In 1820 he was given the Cross of Saint-Louis. Pierre Marec died in Paris on 23 January 1828. His son, Th√©ophiIe-Marie-Finist√®re Marec (1792-1851), was director of naval personnel in 1848.

Justin Bourque, a 24-year-old Moncton resident, shot five officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), killing three and severely injuring two. A manhunt for Bourque was launched and continued overnight and into June 5. On June 6, Bourque was found and taken into custody, ending a manhunt that lasted over 28 hours. The shooting was both Moncton's first homicide since 2010 and the deadliest attack on the RCMP since the Mayerthorpe tragedy in 2005, which left four RCMP officers dead. Details =Shootings= At around 6:00 p.m. on June 4, 2014, Justin Bourque purchased three boxes of ammunition in the presence of a friend, who did not find it unusual since the two of them planned to go to a shooting range. During the late hours of that same day, Bourque left his rented home, dressed in camouflage and carrying an M14 rifle and a shotgun. He calmly walked down a road in his trailer park, passing several neighbours along the way. At 7:18 p.m. ADT, the first 9-1-1 call was made to police about an armed man walking down a sidewalk on Pioneer Avenue and towards the woods west of the street. Twelve officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) responded to the scene and set up a perimeter around the woods and the surrounding neighbourhood. Bourque was first seen by Constable Mathieu Daigle stepping out of the forest, crossing a street, and entering another wooded area that bordered the backyards of several houses. Daigle sent out a radio transmission describing Bourque, but some radio static was heard, which made the description difficult to understand. Daigle was then joined by Csts. Fabrice Gevaudan and Rob Nickerson as they trailed Bourque, who was headed toward a house on Bromfield Court, where five other officers were positioned. All of the officers were intending on maintaining visual contact on Bourque while waiting for the arrival of Police Dog Services, who were scheduled to arrive in a few minutes. Bourque first opened fire at 7:46 p.m. after heading towards a backyard, during which he allegedly heard one of the officers shouting, \\"Hey!\\" He fired three shots at Gevaudan, all of which missed. Gevaudan fled and radioed the officers that he was being shot at, before being hit twice in the torso from about 30 meters away. He died almost instantly. Gevaudan's body was found a few minutes later and dragged into a nearby garage by other officers, where CPR was attempted. Bourque then fled the woods and emerged southeast of McCoy Street, where he continued walking in a straight line on Mailhot Avenue. There, two minutes after he shot Gevaudan, he encountered Constable David Ross, who was driving a police SUV down the road. Ross drew his service pistol and accelerated his vehicle towards Bourque as he was turning to face his direction. Ross fired two shots at Bourque through his windshield, while Bourque returned fire with his M14, firing six shots back at him. Ross was shot twice in the hand and left shoulder, with a third fatal shot being directed at the head. It was believed Ross was attempting to hit Bourque with his vehicle or get within range to open fire with his service weapon. Constable Eric White later found his body still slumped inside the driver's seat before being forced to take cover behind the vehicle after spotting Bourque taking aim at him from further down the street. At 7:54 p.m., Constable Martine Beno√Æt arrived at the intersection of Hildegard Drive and Mailhot Avenue, being guided there by a civilian who was following Bourque and reporting where he was headed via 9-1-1 call. Bourque, taking cover in a deeply shaded and wooded ditch, opened fire on her and disabled her police vehicle with gunfire, preventing her from escaping. Constable √âric St√©phane J. Dubois responded to assist her and was wounded by gunfire while trying to give Beno√Æt additional cover. Bourque then crossed Hildegard Drive and left, allowing Dubois to flee to the local fire station nearby. Beno√Æt, unaware that she was safe, remained inside her vehicle for a period of time and had to be picked up by another officer. At 7:59 p.m., seconds after the Hildegard shooting, Constable Marie Darlene Goguen responded to the fire station in her police vehicle, whereupon she was fired at while still seated inside and hit twice. Goguen was able to flee from the immediate vicinity with the help of Constable Donnie Robertson. Both Dubois and Goguen survived their gunshot wounds. At this point, communications became confusing and chaotic, with the details of casualties, shooting locations, and Bourque's location varying. At 8:04 p.m., Constable Douglas Larche, who was plain- clothed but also wearing body armour, and armed with a shotgun, responded at Mailhot Avenue. There, he was spotted by Bourque, who then concealed himself behind several trees and fired four shots at him, wounding him. Larche returned fire with seven shots from his service pistol. Nearby residents tried to warn him about Bourque, but he was fatally shot in the neck as he tried to take cover behind his car. The entire exchange of gunfire lasted for 70 seconds. It was captured on a cellphone camera, filmed by nearby residents. Bourque then fled the scene at 8:13 p.m. and escaped into the woods behind Isington Street. He had been last sighted near Ryan Street and Wheeler Boulevard. Late on June 4, it was reported that three RCMP officers were killed, while two other officers were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.\\"Three RMCP officers shot dead in Moncton\\" , News919, June 4, 2014. According to witnesses, Bourque spotted and even spoke to several civilians while lying in wait, and left without shooting at them. Other witnesses reported that he actually waved away civilians when they tried helping the officers. The New York Times reported that television footage showed \\"several cars and police vehicles with bullet holes and shattered windows\\". The northwest area of Moncton was locked down while the search for the shooter was in progress; public buses were pulled from the streets, and all entrances to the locked-down area were sealed. =Manhunt= Red circle: Suspect found Black circles: Shooting locations Blue circle: Suspect's residence Authorities named Bourque as the suspect after his family and friends saw photos of him during the shootings on Hildegard Drive circulating on news reports and social media. Multiple sightings of the suspect, by police and the public, continued in the second day of the manhunt. Up to 300 police personnel were involved in the search. Because Bourque's location was unknown at the time and he was heavily armed, a definitive perimeter and containment protocol was not established and all of the officers' activities were considered high-risk. Pedestrians and motorists were asked to stay away from the area of the search; public transit was suspended; and schools, government offices, stores, and businesses were closed. Residents were later instructed to lock their doors, leave their exterior lights on, and refrain from broadcasting police movements on social media sites. The next day, police surrounded an apartment building and were broadcasting a demand to exit over a public address system. More than a dozen armed officers surrounded the building and deployed a robot with a camera inside at approximately 3:00 p.m. Minutes later, they left the apartment complex after finding no sign of Bourque. The report that called police over to the building later turned out to be a false alarm. A police helicopter with thermal-imaging cameras was deployed to search Moncton. At least two armoured cars were borrowed by the RCMP to transport heavily armed tactical team members. On June 6, at 12:10 a.m. (Atlantic Daylight Time), Bourque was arrested by the RCMP with the help of a Transport Canada surveillance aircraft, after a resident saw him crouched below a window in a yard on Mecca Drive and called police. The lock-down, in effect for approximately 28 hours in the north end of Moncton, was lifted shortly thereafter. While being taken into custody, Bourque reportedly told police, \\"I'm done.\\" He was unarmed at the time of his arrest, but several weapons were found at the scene. On June 7, a search was launched at a field and a wooded area located near the scene of the arrest. =Victims= Three RCMP officers were killed in the shootings and another two injured. All five shooting victims were identified by police two days after the shootings. The dead were identified as Cst. David Ross, 32, of Victoriaville, Quebec; Cst. Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, of Boulogne- Billancourt, France; and Cst. Douglas James Larche, 40, of Saint John, New Brunswick. The two surviving officers were identified as Cst. √âric St√©phane J. Dubois and Cst. Marie Darlene Goguen. On August 11, the causes of death were released in an agreed statement of facts filed by the Moncton Queen's Bench. Ross died from a gunshot wound to the head, Gevaudan died of two gunshot wounds to the chest, and Larche died of shots to the head and left flank. Perpetrator Justin Christian Bourque (born November 12, 1989), a resident of Moncton, was named by authorities as a suspect in the shootings. He was 24 years old at the time. Bourque explained in a police interview following his arrest that his actions were a rebellion of sorts against the Canadian government, which he believed to be oppressive. He stated that he believed that police officers were protecting such a government. During the shooting incident, Bourque was dressed in military camouflage and wore a green headband. =Life prior to shooting= Bourque was born as one of seven children in a religious family and was home-schooled. Eighteen months prior to the shooting, he moved out of his parents' home and into a trailer park in Moncton's Ryder Park neighbourhood. Bourque had been forced to move out on his parents' request following a dispute over his purchase of a second firearm and his \\"inappropriate behaviour\\". He had recently quit his job working at a local grocery store and had just been hired by the distribution warehouse Rolly's Wholesale Ltd., according to a company official. =Behavioural problems= A former coworker of Bourque said that \\"he's always seemed to have a problem with authority. Issues with parents, bosses, police...\\"\\"Exclusive: Ex-Coworker Says Suspected Cop-Killer 'Wanted To Go Out With A Bang'\\", Business Insider Bourque also reportedly held anti-government and anti-authority views, had a fascination with conspiracy theories, and talked about killing other people and himself. Two days before the shooting, Bourque made rants against all figures of authority to his father, during which he was described as becoming \\"paranoid\\". The day after the shooting, a local firearm and outdoor supply store, Worlds End Warehouse, issued a statement on their Facebook page, confirming that Bourque was known personally by employees of the store but that he \\"was never a customer and never purchased firearms or ammunition from [them]\\". One of Bourque's friends described an incident where Bourque had gone camping with several coworkers and brought \\"his rifle with him, without ammunition, which he held onto the whole night while drinking. That kind of freaked us out, so we didn't invite him the next time\\". It remains unclear if anyone had previously reported safety concerns related to Bourque's firearm possession, but local police stated that he \\"was not known to them\\". In Canada, individuals who are concerned about the mental state or intentions of a firearms owner can notify the Canadian Firearms Program so that police can investigate. Following his arrest, Bourque claimed that he originally planned to harm the oil industry by setting fire to several Moncton gas stations and then shoot random people, but abandoned the plan due to issues with his bicycle. He purchased the .308 Norinco M305 used in the shootings on July 24, 2009 legally, but had an expired firearms license at the time of the shooting. =Online posts= The media reported that Bourque's Facebook account was filled with images and \\"occasionally jokey posts about the right to bear arms\\". The press reported that his social media contained anti-police posts as well. A post added to his Facebook page the day of the shooting contains a photo with a quote from Dave Chappelle, \\"You ever notice a cop will pull you over for a light out, but if your car is broke down they drive right past you?\\" He also tended to share images with slogans such as \\"Free Men Do Not Ask Permission to Bear Arms\\" and \\"Militia Is Only a Bad Word if You're a Tyrant\\". In his Facebook page, Bourque also posted his beliefs that Canada was \\"too soft\\" to survive an impending attack, and earlier in 2014 wrote that people paying attention to the upcoming 86th Academy Awards were ignoring that: \\"The third world war could be right around the corner, wishful thinking isn't gonna stop this one.\\" Three weeks after that post, he also warned that: \\"Canada is one of the world's most likely targets Russia would invade at the start of a war due to pushover resistance.\\" A few hours prior to the shooting, Bourque posted lyrics from \\"Hook in Mouth\\", a song by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Legal proceedings After his arrest, Bourque admitted responsibility to the shootings and claimed that he committed them in an attempt to spark a rebellion against the Canadian government, which he believed was oppressive, corrupt, and serving only the wealthy at the expense of other citizens. In the afternoon on June 6, Bourque made his first court appearance at a Moncton courthouse under heavy guard. He was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. Also on June 6, Bourque confessed to the crimes in a videotaped one-on-one interview; this, along with one hundred other pieces of evidence, was released into the public domain five weeks after his trial was over.nationalpost.com: \\"Lawyers arguing over whether Justin Bourque‚Äôs confession tape should be made public\\", 16 Nov 2014G+M: \\"Justin Bourque evidence released after judge's order\\", 5 Dec 2014 On July 3, Bourque briefly reappeared in a Moncton provincial court. He made his next court appearance on July 31 after undergoing a psychiatric assessment requested by his lawyer. Bourque was found fit to stand trial. On August 8, Bourque entered guilty pleas to the three counts of first-degree murder and the two counts of attempted murder. On October 27, he apologized to the families of the slain RCMP officers. On October 31, Chief Justice David Smith gave Bourque two concurrent life sentences for the two attempted murders, and three consecutive 25 year minimum sentences for the three premeditated murders, without the possibility of parole for 75 years. This ruling, which fell under the federal government's 2011 enactment to give courts the option of consecutive sentences in cases of multiple murders, was considered the harshest sentence given since the abolition of capital punishment in Canada in 1967. Responses Local businesses express their gratitude for the RCMP after the suspect was apprehended =RCMP and Canadian government= In the wake of the shooting, the New Brunswick Premier David Alward issued a statement, saying that he felt \\"incredible grief\\" from the killings, and offered condolences to the families of the slain officers. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown, commanding officer of New Brunswick's \\"J\\" Division, called June 4 \\"perhaps the darkest day in the history of RCMP New Brunswick\\". Moncton Mayor George LeBlanc said in a statement on Twitter: \\"Terrible sad news for Moncton. Stay indoors and allow police to do their job. Prayers for the families.\\" The House of Commons observed a moment of silence prior to question period the day after the initial shooting. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper also issued a statement, saying, \\"On behalf of all Canadians, Laureen and I offer our deepest condolences to the families, colleagues and friends of those affected by this tragedy. We also offer our prayers for the speedy recovery of those injured.\\" He also remarked that this incident reminds us that \\"men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line in Canada every day to protect our citizens and communities\\". The overall commanding officer of the RCMP, Commissioner Bob Paulson, released a statement saying, \\"Their deaths are beyond comprehension. Their ultimate sacrifices will never be forgotten.\\" An internal review was announced by the RCMP on June 9 to investigate whether the five officers shot were adequately armed and protected to deal with Bourque, who was armed with high-powered firearms, and how to prevent a similar incident from occurring. The review was later ordered on July 3. However, the decision for an internal review was criticized, with many calling for an independent inquiry. Among the critics was Darryl Davies, a criminologist from Carleton University, who had made a report for the RCMP in 2009 about the Mayerthorpe tragedy which left four RCMP officers dead; the report recommended officers be immediately given training and equipped with high-powered firearms. Davies alleged that his report was ignored by the RCMP and believes that an internal review will not result in long-term changes, saying, \\"I think an internal inquiry is not going to be transparent, number one ‚Äì that's why we need a public inquiry.\\" On January 16, 2015, the RCMP released the MacNeil Review, an independent review that was conducted by former RCMP Assistant Commissioner Alphonse MacNeil. It included a total of 64 recommendations concerning supervision, training, technology and equipment, communications, and aftercare. The review revealed that there were complications in communication between officers during the shootings because multiple officers were sending radio transmission at once, and that none of the first responding officers were wearing their body armour. The RCMP publicly announced that it accepted and will implement all of the recommendations, and would keep the public updated on their progress. On 15 May 2015, the RCMP was charged with four Canada Labour Code violations; someone who is found guilty of contravening Section 148(1) is liable to a maximum $1-million fine and/or a prison sentence of two years.nationalpost.com: \\"RCMP charged with labour code breach over deaths of three officers in Moncton shootings\\", 15 May 2015 The RCMP entered not-guilty pleas in May 2016. A spokesman for the Mounted Police Professional Association of Canada said he was \\"surprised and horrified at the same time\\" by the pleas. The wife of one of the victims, Nadine Larche, wrote in a public email that:G+M: \\"RCMP faces labour code trial for ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô in 2014 Moncton shootings\\", 23 Apr 2017 On 6 January 2017, the date 18 April 2017 was set for the start of the trial of the violations, with provincial court Chief Justice R. Leslie Jackson to hear what was expected to be a two month trial.globalnews.ca: \\"RCMP labour trial hears that no one took command during Moncton shooting rampage\\", 17 May 2017cbc.ca: \\"RCMP trial on Labour Code charges in Moncton shootings set for April 18\\", 6 Jan 2017 When the violations trial began in April 2017, the first prosecution witness was RCMP Superintendent Bruce Stuart. Stuart testified that: \\"C8 carbines were eventually approved by the RCMP senior executive committee in September 2011, more than two and a half years before the Moncton shootings... [I] would have proceeded with a national rollout...\\" instead of the haphazard and partial one that followed one year later.thestar.com: \\"RCMP back in court over alleged labour code violations in Moncton shooting rampage\\", 25 Apr 2017 The final Crown witness was MacNeil, author of the 2015 Review, who lamented that nobody took command during the rampage, so officers were forced to make their own decisions amid the chaos. MacNeil said few front-line supervisors were trained to take control of such situations at the time, that no officers had put on body armour, and that at the time of the incident, RCMP officers in Moncton had only been trained with pistols. =Gun control= Bourque acquired the weapons used in the attack legally. After losing two of its members in the attack, Canadian gun rights advocacy organization the National Firearms Association (NFA) released a statement offering their condolences and deploring the incident. They also claimed, \\"Incidents like these demonstrate...that none of Canada's firearms control efforts over the past 50 years have had any effect on preventing violence, or otherwise stopping bad people from carrying out their evil deeds... The excessive rules in place do not in any way increase public safety, but merely contribute to an expensive and unnecessary regime which harms only those of lawful intent.\\" The executive director of the Canadian Sport Shooting Association felt that the NFA statement was premature and that, instead of gun control, this incident should lead to discussions about \\"mental health issues.\\" The NFA stood by their statement, claiming that they were responding to the calls for tighter gun control that people on social media and in the government were making. A gun control organization, the Coalition for Gun Control, felt the incident was too recent to begin discussing changes. At the same time, a prominent supporter of the group and practising psychiatrist Ron Charach published an op-ed piece in the Toronto Star calling for more stringent gun control. Among other things, he called for the reclassification of semiautomatic rifles as prohibited, the restoration of the Long Gun Registry, and \\"[a]n absolute ban on urban gun collecting...\\" Memorial services On social media, the hashtag #PrayforMoncton began trending.

A letter of recommendation reveals that he traveled extensively along the Erie Railroad taking views. =The Solgram= While he succeeded at commercial work his heart was leading him to new forms of artistic expression.

Each color, red, blue and yellow were printed one layer at a time, registering the image with the negative taken with the corresponding filter. South took patents on the camera and Solgram process in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France and Belgium.

It was time consuming to produce and registering the negatives exactly for the three printings was difficult. The Solgram Color Photo Co. was declared defunct by 1910. In 1911 South filed a complaintComplaint, William C. South v. Eastman Kodak Company (S.D. NY filed Dec. 27, 1911), CCHS. against Eastman Kodak Company charging that they were attempting to create a monopoly by limiting their dealers to Kodak products only. South sued Kodak for $100,000 for losses incurred by the Solgram Paper Company and for $200,000 for loss of profits from his patents. Kodak denied the charges. South‚Äôs evidence was not convincing enough and judgment was not in his favor. Undaunted, South opened the Keystone School of Photography in his building on St. Joseph‚Äôs Alley in Downingtown in 1910.

The film was based on a short story, entitled The Fire- walker by John Russell, and starred Sally O'Neil, Reginald Sharland, Mitchell Lewis, and Duke Kahanamoku. Plot Shot from the film Jim, a British Lord, suffers from pyrophobia, a fear of fire, which he developed during the war. Unable to cope with his condition, he flees civilization, coming to rest in the island paradise of Suva, in Fiji. As he is attempting to drink himself into forgetfulness, he meets Josie, who is a showgirl stranded on the island. Josie had become friends with Kalita, who talked the owner of the bar into giving Josie a job. It is in the bar where Jim and Josie meet, and the two develop a liking for one another, which causes McEwen, the local heavy to become jealous. After McEwen challenges Jim to a fight, which Jim backs away from, causing those around him to believe he has a cowardly streak. Josie, however, continues to believe in him. McEwen steps up his animosity towards Jim, taunting him into following McEwen to the nearby island of Benga, where McEwen intends to force Jim to participate in the local custom of fire- walking. Jim, forced to confront his fear, overcomes it, and passes through the fire pit, after which he defeats McEwen in a fight, and ends up with Josie.

RKO purchased the rights to the story, and scheduled the film for their 1929-30 production schedule, under the title The Firewalker. RKO finished filming on the project in December 1929. RKO began production on the movie in October 1929. In November 1929, it was revealed that Sally O'Neil would appear in the film, and later that month, it was revealed that Frank Reicher had been loaned to RKO from its sister studio, Pathe, to write additional dialogue for the screenplay. On November 20, Variety reported that Donald McKenzie, Arthur Clayton, Gerald Barry, and Leyland Hodgson had been assigned to the cast, although Hodgson's appearance in the film is not confirmed by other industry sources. Around New Years 1930, RKO announced that they were changing the title of the film from The Firewalker to Girl of the Port. That same month it was revealed that in addition to the sound picture, RKO would also release a silent version of the film. Reception In an article in Close Up magazine, Girl of the Port, along with several other American films, was lauded as an example of the \\"new humanitarianism\\". Motion Picture Magazine did not give the film a favorable review, calling it \\"just another melo[drama]\\". They did give Sally O'Neil high marks, calling her acting effort \\"heroic\\", although they were less than complimentary to the rest of the cast. Motion Picture News gave the film a favorable review, although they felt it was inappropriate for children. While they did not care for O'Neil's performance, finding it a bit overdone, they did compliment Reginald Sharland's work in the picture, and they found Mitchell Lewis' work excellent. They also complimented the work of Bert Glennon, while at the same time not enjoying Beulah Marie Dix's screenplay.

Career =Journalism= Navalkar began his career as a journalist and commentator while he was still a college student. In 1955, he began writing a weekly column titled Bhatkyaachee Bhramanti (\\"Man About Town\\") in the Marathi language daily Navshakti. The column, which dealt with political, social and cultural issues, ran continuously for 52 years without a break, and ended only with his death. This consistency earned him a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest-running op-ed column in the world. =Politics= His career as a successful journalist and writer led him gradually to politics. Navalkar was one of the earliest members of the Shiv Sena. He joined that newly founded party in 1968, and remained with it till his death fifty years later, exhibiting a degree of steadfastness and loyalty which is rare in Indian politics. He was elected as a corporator to the Bombay Municipal Corporation on the Shiv Sena ticket from a ward in Girgaum, Mumbai, in 1968. In 1972, he became a state legislator after winning the assembly election to the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha from the Girgaum (Opera House) constituency in south Mumbai, winning by over 25,000 votes. After this, he consistently won the election to the upper house (Maharashtra Vidhan Parishad) from the Mumbai Graduates‚Äô constituency from 1986 to 2006. Between 1995 and 1999, he served as minister of cultural affairs when his party, the Shiv Sena, was in power in Maharashtra. He was instrumental in projects like Nana Nani (for the elderly) parks. Personal life Navalkar was born into a middle-class Marathi- speaking family. His father's name was Sachchidanand Navalkar. At a young age (just short of 20), Navalkar was married to Vandana, a lady of his own community and similar background. The marriage, which was arranged by their parents in the usual Indian tradition, was harmonious and happy. The couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary about two years before Navalkar died. They were the parents of two daughters, Reshma and Shilpa, who are married to educated gentlemen and well-settled with their own families. Navalkar was a long-time diabetic. In 1995, just around the time he became a cabinet minister in the state government, Navalkar also underwent a heart by- pass operation. He died of a heart attack at his residence in Mumbai on Tuesday, 20 Nov 2007, at the age of 72. He was survived by his wife of over 50 years and two daughters.

He learnt the Gwalior gharana singing style from K.N.Ienger and learnt sitar from N.R.Rama Rao. He studied tabla under Bandu Khan of Ajrara gharana. Suvir found inspiration in Veena from S. Balchandar of the Karnatic tradition. He believes that older themes in classical music don't have much importance to modern Indian living and, to popularize classical music, contemporary themes should be used. For this he introduced modern Hindi mukta chhanda poetry within Dhrupad composition structure, and also used newer themes in Hindi literature instead of traditional Awadhi language or Braj Bhasha. Suvir Misra plays and also makes the Rudra Veena. Suvir has performed on various platforms within India. Significant works His efforts have brought back Karnatic Saraswathi Veena into the mainstream Hindustani classical music scene. * He has also developed a unique fingering style to play fast taans of Khayal. * He is the inventor of Misr Veena. * Suvir Misra has been trying to bring extinct Veenas, like Jantari, Kinnari etc., back to life. Musical style Suvir prefer to play the Rudra Veena, Saraswati Veena and Surbahar in the Gayaki Ang (Vocal Style). This style integrates all the subtle characteristics of the human voice into the performance.

Early life  Katz was born to a Jewish familyJewish Exponent: \\"Philanthropist Is Co-Owner of Papers\\" April 4, 2012 in Camden, New Jersey, on January 11, 1942, and grew up in the Parkside section of the city, now one of New Jersey's most crime-ridden. He was raised along with his sister, Sandra Katz (Wolff) by their mother, a secretary at RCA, after their father died when they were very young.  Career  He became a lawyer and businessman, making millions in parking lots, billboards and sports. Katz was a former owner of Kinney Parking Systems, at the time the largest parking company in New York City, and the former chairman of Interstate Outdoor Advertising, one of the largest regional outdoor-advertising firms in the country. He was the majority owner of five radio stations in Atlantic and Cape May counties at the Jersey Shore, and a founding partner of the law firm Katz, Ettin & Levine in Cherry Hill. =Sports ownership = Katz invested in the two New Jersey sports teams back in 2000. He was part of the YankeeNets/Puck Holdings group along with Ray Chambers. The group purchased the New Jersey Devils from their original owner Dr. John McMullen. Katz's ownership involvement of both teams ended in 2003 when the YankeeNets group disintegrated with the Devils being sold to Jeffrey Vanderbeek and the Nets sold to Bruce Ratner. The Devils have since been sold again while the Nets were also sold and moved to Brooklyn. = Philanthropy = He was the director of the Katz Foundation, which supports charitable, educational and medical causes. To support pioneering medical research, Katz established an annual prize and endowed a visiting professorship in cardiovascular research at Columbia University, where he served on the board of visitors of the medical school. His $15 million gift to The Dickinson Schools of Law of The Pennsylvania State University helped fund the renovation of historic Trickett Hall at Dickinson Law in Carlisle, PA, and fund the development of a law school building for Penn State Law in University Park, PA, both of which bear his name. As a native of Camden, New Jersey, Katz established several programs to help Camden children. Katz donated to Jewish organizations, focused on young Jewish entrepreneurs. Katz was a donor to the Jewish Federation of Southern New Jersey, Congregation Beth El in Voorhees, New Jersey, and the National Museum of American Jewish History.

The reconstruction focuses on an area known as the region of interest (ROI). Although interior reconstruction can be applied to dental or cardiac CT images, the concept is not limited to CT. It is applied with one of several methods. Methods The purpose of each method is to solve for vector x in the following problem: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g \\\\end{bmatrix}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix}. Region of interest (ROI) of an image showing an object Let X be the region of interest (ROI) and Y be the region outside of X. Assume A, B, C, D are known matrices; x and y are unknown vectors of the original image, while f and g are vector measurements of the responses (f is known and g is unknown). x is inside region X, (x \\\\in X) and y, in the region Y, (y \\\\in Y), is outside region X. f is inside a region in the measurement corresponding to X. This region is denoted as F, (f \\\\in F), while g is outside of the region F. It corresponds to Y and is denoted as G, (g \\\\in G). For CT image- reconstruction purposes, C = 0 . To simplify the concept of interior reconstruction, the matrices A, B, C, D are applied to image reconstruction instead of complex operators. The first interior-reconstruction method listed below is extrapolation. It is a local tomography method which eliminates truncation artifacts but introduces another type of artifact: a bowl effect. An improvement is known as the adaptive extrapolation method, although the iterative extrapolation method below also improves reconstruction results. In some cases, the exact reconstruction can be found for the interior reconstruction. The local inverse method below modifies the local tomography method, and may improve the reconstruction result of the local tomography; the iterative reconstruction method can be applied to interior reconstruction. Among the above methods, extrapolation is often applied. = Extrapolation method = 1) Projections of Sheep-Logan phantoms 2) Truncated projections (zero extrapolation) 3) Constant, 4) exponential and 5) quadratical extrapolations 6) Mixed extrapolation of 4 and 5 : \\\\begin{bmatrix} f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g \\\\end{bmatrix}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} A, B, C, D are known matrices; x and y are unknown vectors; f is a known vector, and g is an unknown vector. We need to know the vector x. x and y are the original image, while f and g are measurements of responses. Vector x is inside the region of interest X, (x \\\\in X). Vector y is outside the region X. The outside region is called Y, (y \\\\in Y) and f is inside a region in the measurement corresponding to X. This region is denoted F, (f \\\\in F). The region of vector g (outside the region F) also corresponds to Y and is denoted as G, (g \\\\in G). In CT image reconstruction, it has : C = 0 To simplify the concept of interior reconstruction, the matrices A, B, C, D are applied to image reconstruction instead of a complex operator. The response in the outside region can be a guess G; for example, assume it is g_{ex} : \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_0 \\\\end{bmatrix}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix} f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g_{ex} \\\\end{bmatrix} a) Shepp- Logan head phantom b) Crop of the phantom c) Reconstruction without extrapolation d) Reconstruction with constant, (e) quadratic and (f) mixed extrapolation A solution of x is written as x_0, and is known as the extrapolation method.

Katsevich, 1999 Cone beam local tomography, SIAM J APPL MATH 59, 2224‚Äì2246. = Local inverse method = The local inverse method extends the concept of local tomography. The response in the outside region can be calculated as follows: : f = A x + B y Consider the generalized inverse B^+ satisfying :B B^+ B = B Define :Q=[I-BB^+] so that :QB = 0 Hence, :Q f = Q A x The above equation can be solved as :x_1 = A^+ Q^+ Q f, considering that :QQ = Q :QQQ = Q Q is the generalized inverse of Q, i.e. :Q^+ = Q The solution can be simplified as :x_1 = A^+ Q f. The matrix A^+Q = A^+ [I-BB^+] is known as the local inverse of matrix {\\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}} , corresponding to A. This is known as the local inverse method. = Iterative reconstruction method = Here a goal function is defined, and this method iteratively achieves the goal. If the goal function can be some kind of normal, this is known as the minimal norm method. : \\\\min( R\\\\x\\\\ + S\\\\y\\\\+T\\\\g\\\\), subject to : \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix} f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g \\\\end{bmatrix} and f is known, where R, S and T are weighting constants of the minimization and \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ is some kind of norm. Often-used norms are L_0, L_1, L_2, L_{+\\\\infty} total variation (TV) norm or a combination of the above norms. An example of this method is the projection onto convex sets (POCS) method.Ye.

Liu and C. Xiang, A new iterative reconstruction algorithm for 2D exterior fanbeam CT, Journal of XRay Science and Technology 18 (2010), 267‚Äì277. =Analytical solution= In special situations, the interior reconstruction can be obtained as an analytical solution; the solution of x is exact in such cases.Y. Zou and X. Pan, 2004, Exact image reconstruction on PIlines from minimum data in helical conebeam CT, Physics in Medicine and Biology 49(6), 941‚Äì959.M. Defrise, F. Noo, R. Clackdoyle and H.

Pack, A twostep Hilbert transform method for 2D image reconstruction, Phys Med Biol 49 (2004), 3903‚Äì3923. =Fast extrapolation= Extrapolated data often convolutes to a kernel function. After data is extrapolated its size is increased N times, where N = 2 ~ 3\\\\. If the data needs to be convoluted to a known kernel function, the numerical calculations will increase log(N)*N times, even with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). An algorithm exists, analytically calculating the contribution from part of the extrapolated data. The calculation time can be omitted, compared to the original convolution calculation; with this algorithm, the calculation of a convolution using the extrapolated data is not noticeably increased. This is known as fast extrapolation. S Zhao, K Yang, X Yang, Reconstruction from truncated projections using mixed extrapolations of exponential and quadratic functions, Journal of X-ray Science and Technology, 2011, 19(2) pp 155‚Äì72 Comparison of methods The extrapolation method is suitable in a situation where :: x > y and X > Y : i.e. a small truncation artifacts situation. The adaptive extrapolation method is suitable for a situation where :: x \\\\sim y and X \\\\sim Y : i.e. a normal truncation artifacts situation. This method also offers a rough solution for the exterior region. The iterative extrapolation method is suitable for a situation in which :: x \\\\sim y and X \\\\sim Y : i.e. a normal truncation artifacts situation. Although this method gets better interior reconstruction compared to adaptive reconstruction, it misses the result in the exterior region. Local tomography is suitable for a situation in which :: x \\\\ll y and X \\\\ll Y : i.e. a largest truncation artifacts situation. Although there are no truncation artifacts in this method, there is a fixed error (independent of the value of y) in the reconstruction. The local inverse method, identical to local tomography, suitable in a situation in which :: x \\\\ll y and X \\\\ll Y : i.e. a largest truncation artifacts situation. Although there are no truncation artifacts for this method, there is a fixed error (independent of the value of y) in the reconstruction which may be smaller than with local tomography. The iterative reconstruction method obtains a good result with large calculations. Although the analytic method achieves an exact result, it is only functional in some situations. The fast extrapolation method can get the same results as the other extrapolation methods, and can be applied to the above interior reconstruction methods to reduce the calculation.

Verbatim, > except to render Egyptian xtxt in author's accompanying hieroglyphic > transcript, his ‚Äúprevented‚Äù is replaced by ‚Äústopped‚Äù) In the typical presentation, Spell 151 centers on care of the mummy and its accessories by Anubis and other gods, especially the four sons of Horus.Kemp 2007, p. 66 The format is to have each god or entity involved say something which is quoted by columns of hieroglyphic text next to a small illustration of that entity. Anubis himself does not speak,Von Dassow 1998, plate 33 but is shown standing over the mummy, which lies on a bier.Von Dassow 1998, plate 33Taylor 2001, p. 197 Canopic jars containing the decedent‚Äôs viscera are underneath the bier. The goddess Isis, four gods known as the sons of Horus, and the ba (a \\"personality,\\"'Taylor 2001, p. 20 or, literally, \\"what is immanent\\"Smith 2009, p. 3 of the deceased are among those with speaking parts in this spell.Von Dassow 1998, plate 33 The importance of the decedent‚Äôs heart is shown by the custom of leaving it in situ during the embalming process.Taylor 2001, p. 54 Evidence of the need to protect internal organs from harm even after removal is abundant in the use of canopic jars to preserve them.Taylor 2001, pp. 65-66 The heart, not placed in a jar, benefited from its own magical utterances, for example where Book of the Dead Spell 27 says, :\\"Hail to you, lords of eternal repetition, founders of eternal sameness! Don‚Äôt take my heart from me.\\"Allen 2010, Answer to Exercise 16.33, p. 485 A role for Isis in the proceedings is attested in the Coffin Texts at Spell 148: :‚ÄúOh!‚Äù says Atum (to Isis). ‚ÄúGuard your heart, O woman!‚ÄùFaulkner 1968, p 40 This quote, which relates to her pregnancy with Horus, holds uncertain relevance to the House of Hearts issue. Isis speaks in Spell 151, however. She is the guardian of Imseti, who in turn guards the canopic jar containing the liver. As well Isis is a member of the Heliopolitan cosmology's Ennead, a system of gods often extended to include Horus.Bunson 2009, p. 132. Book of the Dead Spell 30A appears to connect the heart with afterlife judgments, imploring: :\\"My heart of my mother, my heart of my mother, my heart of my earthly being! Do not stand against me as witness.\\" Irmtraut Munro in University College, London. 2002. Digital Egypt for Universities, Book of the Dead. [website]. http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/bdbynumber.html The panel of gods evaluating the deceased appear in Spell 125. By the time of Qenna, the 18th Dynasty Theban redaction of the creation and mortuary had taken place,Bunson 2009, p. 89. resulting in the Book of the Dead itself, selections of which were copied onto papyrus and included in burial equipment.Kemp 2007, pp. 4, 16. Yet this material derives from the earlier Coffin Texts already having demonstrated an intimate trio of heart, mother, and ba: :\\"Geb has opened your eyes for you, which were blind; he has stretched out your thighs, which were bent. The heart of your mother has been given to you, your heart of your body. Your ba is in the earth; your corpse is in the ground.\\" CT I, 55f-56d.Zabkar 1968, p. 110. Geb is another member of the Ennead. Thebes of course emphasized its powerful state god Amun, soon also in syncretic manifestation as Amun-Re.Shaw 2000, pp. 122, 209-210, 266-267. It is notable that these gods remain segregated from the heart-related material above, having their own hymns within the Book of the Dead corpus. Indeed, the deceased's heart remains singular and crucial in mortuary to the end of Egyptian religion. Qenna, although it omits Spell 30A,University of Bonn. n.d. D√§s Alt√§gyptische Totenbuch, object record TM 134346 [website] http://totenbuch.awk.nrw.de/objekt/tm134346 sheds additional light on this process of belief. Reasons that the heart might need returning to the deceased, despite its having been left in the body during mummification, remain obscure. Considered a signal in this question is the ‚Äúweighing of the heart‚Äù scene in Book of the Dead Spell 125 (also conducted by Anubis), which shows the heart outside the body,van Dijk 1995, pp. 9-10Kemp 2007, pp. 56-57 among other instances in funerary literature of acts or incantations to restore the heart and its function.Kemp 2007, p. 68Taylor 2001, pp. 200, 205-208 Qenna appears to date from the late 18th or early 19th Dynasty, based on the decedent‚Äôs soft, rounded abdomen and the clothing style, with simple pleated kilt in his pictorial representations in the papyrus.van Dijk 1995, pp. 10-11  See also  Book of the Dead * Book of the Dead of Amen-em-hat  Bibliography Allen, J.P. 2010.

Content and style This stream of consciousness novel explores an Irish girl's relationship with her disabled brother, religious mother, and her own troubled sexuality. Joshua Cohen described how McBride's experimental style \\"forgoes quotation marks and elides verbiage for sense, sound and sheer appearance on the page. For emphasis it occasionally wreaks havoc on capItals and reverses letter order.\\"  Genesis and publication  McBride began writing her debut novel whilst working in a series of office temp jobs. It took nine years to find a publisher and was rejected by numerous companies. The book was eventually first published in 2013, with an initial print run of 1000 copies, by Galley Beggar Press of Norwich, England. Mr Layte, of Galley Beggar Press recalled that the unusual writing-style led him to take up the novel where others had overlooked it: > I thought this was one of the most important books I had ever read. It had > the same effect on me as when I first read Samuel Beckett. It was a game- > changer as far as what could be done. In 2014, rights for a trade paperback were sold to publishers Faber and Faber. Reviews and prizes In a New York Times review, Joshua Cohen described the book as being \\"in all respects, a heresy ‚Äî which is to say, Lord above, it‚Äôs a future classic.\\" Reviewing the novel for The Guardian, Anne Enright wrote that it \\"is hard to read for the best reasons: everything about it is intense and difficult and hard-won.\\" A New Yorker review by James Wood recounted the novel as \\"blazingly daring. . . . Eimear McBride prose is a visceral throb, and the sentences run meanings together to produce a kind of compression in which words, freed from the tedious march of sequence, seem to want to merge with one another, as paint and musical notes can. The results are thrilling, and also thrillingly efficient.‚Äù Kirkus Reviews states that the novel is \\"exhilarating fiction from a voice to watch.\\" Adam Mars-Jones in his review for the London Review of Books described the work of Eimear McBride as \\"if every book was as intense as this, reading literature would be even more of a minority pursuit than it is already. A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing makes that rapturous lament By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept look like Hotel du Lac. But then you wouldn‚Äôt want to go to Not I every night of the week.\\" Annie Galvin for Los Angeles Review of Books stated that \\"to read the opening paragraph of Eimear McBride‚Äôs novel is to be radically disoriented. Sentence fragments pile up, and the familiar skeleton of the English sentence gets fractured, splintered into microscopic units (‚ÄúYou‚Äôll soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúBile for.‚Äù) that truncate without pointing in any obvious direction. The novel is many things: an elegy, a fever dream, a document of abuse, a distorted transposition of one consciousness into language. It is not clear; it is not easy. It takes effort to decode.\\" NPR book reviewer Heller McAlpin advice to the readers is to \\"be prepared to be blown away by this raw, visceral, brutally intense neomodernist first novel. There's nothing easy about Eimear McBride's novel, from its fractured language to its shattering story of the young unnamed narrator's attempt to drown mental anguish with physical pain.\\" The novel won several awards including the Kerry Group Irish Novel of the Year, the Goldsmiths Prize, the Desmond Elliott Prize, the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction, and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize. The Guardian Book Club featured the novel in 2016, and the BBC Radio 4 Book Club featured the novel in early 2018.  Adaptations  In 2014, the novel was adapted for the stage by Annie Ryan. Initially appearing at the Corn Exchange, Dublin, the production later appeared at the Young Vic in London, the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, and the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York. The Times Literary Supplementcritic Davic Collard described the experience in his review as \\"When I saw the show again the following night it was, if anything, even more powerful. Like the novel, it has a momentous presence. Unlike the novel, the play is a collective experience.\\" The audiobook of the novel, read by the author, was released in 2014.

Early life Austin Roe was born March 2, 1748 in Port Jefferson, New York. He married Catherine Jones, and the couple had eight children. His great-grandson, Justus Roe, was the inventor of the modern day retractable carpenter's tape measure.NOTE: Justus Roe and Sons Co. produced the 'Roe Electric Reel Tape Measures' during the 1890s and early 1900s when they started marking increments and numbers on the tapes. See U.S. Patent number 387541, 8/7/1888, reel for tape measure. Career Roe was the owner of a tavern in East Setauket. \\"Roe's Tavern\\" is an extant structure (now a privately owned residence) where George Washington stayed overnight during his 1790 tour of Long Island. Culper ring =Background= In December 1778, General George Washington's chief of intelligence‚Äîand Culper Ring spymaster Major Benjamin Tallmadge‚Äîrecruited Jonas Hawkins as a clandestine courier to bring messages to Setuaket from New York City, where the group's leader, Abraham Woodhull was gathering information. From there, the coded correspondence could be relatively easily forwarded to Tallmadge. At first, the ring employed just Hawkins in the role, but by early summer, Roe had joined the group as an alternate rider, who would take messages the between the group's two major centers of operation, Setauket, New York and New York City. At the time, both cities were occupied by the British. =Work as spy = Roe and Hawkins passed the messages from New York City to operative Caleb Brewster on Long Island. Brewster would take them across the Sound to Tallmadge at Fairfield, Connecticut. From there, Tallmadge forwarded the messages to Washington.Nelson, David Paul. Culper Ring in Hastedt, Glenn, P., ed. Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operations: A-J. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2011. . p. 217. Roe served the Culper spy ring as a courier by secretly relaying its messages beginning in early 1779. He claimed to be conducting business as a merchant in order to avoid suspicion and pass through the British check-points.Rose, Alexander; Washington's Spies: The Story of America's First Spy Ring; New York: Bantam Dell, a division of Random House; (20067); ; Pp. 172 Roe became the sole dispatch carrier for the ring after July 1779, when Tallmadge gave Roe‚Äìbut not Hawkins‚Äìa code number in his code index. Hawkins increasing paranoia had led him to abandon the mission at that time. =In historical records= Because Roe traveled over 1000 miles on horseback performing his missions during the war, he has been called the \\"Paul Revere of Long Island.\\" In 2015, a letter written by loyalist soldier Nehemiah Marks to Adjutant General Oliver De Lancey, head of British Army Intelligence following Major John Andre‚Äôs capture and execution, was uncovered.Long Island's Austin Roe, American Spy; New York Almanac online; accessed May 2020 The document contained information that brothers Nathaniel and Phillip Roe were part of the \\"Long Island spy network,\\" but the allegations were neither investigated nor acted upon.Leuzzi, Linda A Letter of Significance; Long Island Advance, accessed October 22, 2015 Later life After the war, Roe continued to operate his tavern in Setauket.

He opened an inn there, where for three decades he regaled his patrons with tales of his exploits during the war. Roe died in Suffolk County in 1830 at the age of 82; and was buried in the family graveyard.

He is locally celebrated for his actions during the disaster. Early life and education Klegman was born in 1938 to Sam and Thelma Klegman. He was a Cub Scout and a newspaper delivery boy for the Tacoma News Tribune. In this latter capacity he had won a bicycle for selling the most newspaper subscriptions. By 1949, at the age of 11, he was a volunteer on the safety patrol at Lowell Elementary, where he was enrolled in the sixth grade. Olympia earthquake and death On the day of his death, Klegman had been assigned to noon safety patrol duty. He was responsible for ensuring younger students walking home during lunch safely crossed the street. According to witnesses, Klegman left class for patrol at 11:50 a.m. on April 13, five minutes before the earthquake struck. As the temblor began, Klegman shouted to Myrna Phelps, a second grader who was standing in the school yard, \\"Stop where you are! Stay there!\\" Phelps, who was about to run inside the building, froze in position. Phelps has credited Klegman's order for her to remain in the relative safety of the school yard with saving her life. Klegman then rushed inside the building to find kindergarten student Kelcy Robert Allen alone in a hallway. Klegman grabbed Allen by the hand and led him outside as the building began to crumble. Unable to make it clear of the structure, Klegman shielded Allen with his body and was killed by falling bricks. Allen, though injured, made a full recovery. Klegman was interred at Home of Peace cemetery in Lakewood, Washington on April 15, 1949. The Lowell Elementary School safety patrol provided a cordon of honor during the funeral.
