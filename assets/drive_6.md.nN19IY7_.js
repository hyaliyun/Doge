Biography Famous Oval room in the Teylers Museum painted by Wybrand Hendriks, showing Martin van Marum's electriseermachine, one of 9 works by Hendriks hanging in Teylers First Painting Gallery Wybrand Hendriks was born in a sculptor family, as the son of the sculptor Hendrik Hendriksz (ca. 1704-1782) and his wife Aaltje Claasdr. Both of his brothers, Hendrik jr. and Frans, followed in the footsteps of their father, also becoming sculptors. His only sister, Cornelia, married the sculptor Rijk Rijke. According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History, he learned to paint while working in the decorative wallpaper factory of Johannes Remmers, in Amsterdam.Wybrand Hendriks in the RKD In 1772 he purchased a wallpaper company from Anthony Palthe, son of Gerhard Jan Palthe. In 1775, he married Anthony Palthe's widow, Agatha Ketel, whom he had drawn previously in 1773, wearing mourning clothes.Artikel van het Teylers: \\"Het portret van Wybrand Hendriks en zijn echtgenote Agatha Ketel\\" Interior with woman A painting he later made in 1791 of her sitting across from him at a table (probably situated in the fundatiehuis) was purchased for Teylers Museum with support from the Vereniging Rembrandt in 1999.Portrait of the couple on Vereniging Rembrandt Later that year they got married [again?], and made a trip to England and Belgium. In the 1780s he served a five-year term as one of the directors of the Haarlemse Tekenacademie (Haarlem drawing academy). He assumed the position of concierge (\\"kastelein\\") of the Teyler's Stichting in Haarlem in 1785, after his predecessor Vincent Jansz van der Vinne had left following a disagreement with Martin van Marum, the head of the fossil and instrument collections.Biographical entry on Wybrand Hendriks on Teylers website Wybrand held this position from 1786 until 1819, and he lived at the \\"Fundatiehuis\\" as curator of the art collection. He maintained and restored the pieces in the collection as well. He maintained a studio in the old drawing room of Teyler's drawing academy, which had been moved to the city hall. As curator, he was responsible for expanding the collection of art, and for that he participated in auctions throughout the Netherlands to purchase drawings. In 1790, through Willem Anne Lestevenon, he managed to purchase an important collection of 1,700 Italian drawings from the collection of Queen Christina of Sweden (the Odescalchi collection). This collection included works by Michelangelo and Raphael, which are currently amongst the most important and valuable pieces in the Teylers Museum art collection. After his wife Agatha died in 1802, he remarried Geertruid Harmsen in 1806, the widow of J.Radecker, the city organist of Haarlem, though she died shortly afterwards, in 1817. Two years later he moved to a house at the Oude Gracht, where he lived until he died in 1831 at the age of 86. Hendriks was active as regent of the Vrouwe- en Antony Gasthuis hofje, a member of the Haarlem city council, and was a patriotic supporter of the French revolution at the end of the 19th century. Among his registered pupils were Hermanus van Brussel, Warnaar Horstink, Gerrit Johan van Leeuwen, Hendrina Alida Sollewijn, Abraham Vallenduuk, and Jacobus Vrijmoet.  Works  He is known for portraits, landscapes, and copies after older masters, such as flower still lifes in the manner of Jan van Huysum. Hendriks created several paintings in and around the Teylers Museum, for example of the directors of the Teylers Stichting, the Oval Room and the inner garden of the Foundation House. His paintings of the inner garden of the Foundation House and the Oval Room seem to have been created with the help of convex mirrors and other optical aids because the perspectives are impossible to achieve without this. He created portraits of, amongst others, Jacob van der Vos sr., Christiaan Scholten, Christiaan van Orsoy, Jan Petrus Scholten van Aschat, Frederik Alexander Vern√®de, Wernerus K√∂hne, Adriaan van der Willigen and Martinus van Marum. He also made grisailles, like the one presented here. This grisaille now adorns a fireplace in the Frans Hals Museum in one of the regent's rooms of the Oude mannenhuis. The subject is taken from the marble sculpture in the garden of the Fundatiehuis.

Biography and themes  Goodwin was born in Bournemouth. Central to Goodwin's practice is a fascination with drawing. He is engaged with time as well as line, and with the sculptural potential of two-dimensional images. Other concerns in his practice are the city, ideas of public and private, voyeurism, desire and emotional distance and proximity. Goodwin's work has been shown nationally and internationally, including exhibitions at Tate Modern, Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool, The Photographers‚Äô Gallery, London, The National Portrait Gallery, London, the Venice Biennale, OCAT Contemporary Art Museum Xi'an, China and the Hasselblad Foundation in Gothenburg, Sweden.

It was the second Franciscan religious house to be founded in the country. The establishment included a conventual church that was one of the largest in London; a studium or regional university; and an extensive library of logical and theological texts. It was an important intellectual centre in the early fourteenth century, rivalled only by Oxford University in status. Members of the community at that time included William of Ockham, Walter Chatton and Adam Wodeham. It flourished in the fourteenth and fifteenth century but was dissolved in 1538 at the instigation of Henry VIII as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Christ's Hospital was founded in the old conventual buildings, and the church was rebuilt completely by Sir Christopher Wren as Christ Church Greyfriars after the original church was almost completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666. The building now standing on the site, designed by Arup Group Limited, is currently occupied by Merrill Lynch. It was named after the friars' practice of wearing grey habits. History View of the Greyfriars as imagined by H.W. Brewer in 1895 The Franciscan Order first arrived in England in September 1224, on the Tuesday after The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. They settled in London in the summer of 1225, after John Iwyn, a wealthy businessman, bought a plot of land for them in the parish of St. Nicholas in the Shambles (butchers' quarter).Page pp502‚Äì507 The land was just inside the city wall, which at that time was next to open country. Three years later, Joce Fitz Piers gave the Grey Friars his property in Stinking Lane. Over the next 130 years Londoners and others made 25 further donations of land to the friars, ending with Queen Isabella's donation of a tenement in 1353 or 1354. In 1229 King Henry III gave the Conventual Franciscans of London oak to build their house. By 1243 there were eighty friars in residence, and by 1258 they had extended the site on the North and Westside. The original church was built with money provided by William Joynier (mayor of London in 1239), who built the chapel and also gave two hundred pounds towards the cost of other buildings. Historian Charles Lethbridge Kingsford, who published the London Greyfriars' register and wrote a history of the site in the same volume, concludes from the sums of money spent on building work in this period that the friary would have been \\"of a modest kind\\". Further work began on the church towards the end of the 13th century. Henry le Walleis (d. 1302), another mayor of London, is supposed to have built the nave, and given timber for the altars. In 1301-1302 Queen Margaret (Marguerite of France, born 1282, second wife of King Edward I) spent 60 marks on land in the parish of St. Nicholas for the Grey Friars. The Choir was built on this site. She funded the construction of the church, spending 2,000 marks on the work before her death in 1318, at which point it was still unfinished. Queen Isabella, the wife of Edward II (r. 1327‚Äì1377), was responsible for completing the work, spending around ¬£700. The total expenditure on the new church was about ¬£2700, a huge sum. There were six chapels within the church, eight other altars and many statues and images of saints (at least eight are documented, in addition to those in the chapels and on the altars). The church became a favourite burial place for those of high rank and status. Margaret was buried there, as was Isabella, widow of Edward II; the heart of Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III, was buried there as well. Built in the gothic style, it was completed in 1348, and was the second- largest in medieval London, measuring long by across. The monastery was dissolved in 1538 by Thomas Chapman, an agent of Thomas Cromwell. On 12 November the house signed a deed of surrender, probably composed by Chapman. The Friars were made to confess that \\"the perfeccion of Christian liuyng dothe not conciste in ... weryng of a grey cootte, disgeasing our selffe aftyr straunge fassions, dokynge, nodyngs and bekynge, in gurdyng our selffes wythe a gurdle full of knots, and other like Papisticall ceremonyes\\" After the Surrender, some of the houses on the site were converted for private use, and the church was closed and used as a store-house for treasure looted from the French. In 1547, the king gave the church, the buildings called \\"le Fratrye,\\" \\"le Librarye,\\" \\"le Dorter,\\" and \\"le Chapterhouse,\\" and the ground called \\"le Great Cloyster,\\" and \\"le Little Cloyster\\" to the City of London. The church, which had suffered damage and looting,\\"The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\\" Tucker,T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 now called Christ Church was to be the church of a new parish formed by joining St. Nicholas and St. Ewen.

Even though the show aired on only 67% of American televisions at the time of its premiere, it earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, or 1.9 million households. By its tenth anniversary in 1979, 9 million American children under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Its ratings declined in the 1990s, due to societal changes. A survey conducted in 1996 found that by the age of three, 95% of all American children had watched it. By its fortieth anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children's show. According to writer Michael Davis, Sesame Street is \\"perhaps the most vigorously researched, vetted, and fretted-over program\\". By 2001, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding its efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture. Two landmark summative evaluations, conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. Additional studies conducted throughout the show's history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers. Sesame Street has also been the subjects of many controversies throughout its long run on television. In 1970, a commission in Mississippi voted to exclude the show from its state educational TV programming. The controversy surrounding the show stemmed from cultural and historical reasons regarding children and television's effect on them. Latino and feminists groups criticized Sesame Street for its depictions of some groups, but its producers have worked to address their concerns throughout the years. By 2009, Sesame Street had received 118 Emmy Awards, more than any other television series. Ratings When Sesame Street premiered in 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, or 1.9 million households.Brown, Les (December 24, 1969). \\"Sesame Street: Wunderkind\\". Variety. Quoted in Davis, p. 197. The Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the organization that oversaw the production of Sesame Street, insisted that its seemingly low ratings were misleading. They found that although a small percentage of all viewers watched Sesame Street, approximately a quarter of all preschoolers watched it regularly. Ninety percent of households who viewed the show had children under the age of six.Morrow, p. 117 In the winter of 1970, partly as a response to criticism that they were not reaching their intended audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll were positive in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership.Morrow, pp. 142‚Äî144 Sesame Street's high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty.Lesser, p. 205 Gerald S. Lesser, CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad among college students.Lesser, p. 170 Its ratings steadily increased for the first five seasons, and Nielsen reported that Sesame Street had the highest ratings of any PBS program.Morrow, p. 118 In 1985, the Workshop estimated that 20% of its regular viewers consisted of \\"adult-only households\\". By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, 9 million American children under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show.Davis, p. 277 According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low- income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households. The show's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, when children' viewing habits and the television marketplace had changed. In 1969, the choices in children's programming were limited, but the growth of the home-video industry during the 1980s and the boom in children's programming during the 90s on cable channels like Nickelodeon, which were directly influenced by Sesame Street, resulted in lower ratings for Sesame Street. In 2002, The New York Times reported that \\"learning to click the remote control has become a developmental milestone, like crawling and walking\\". The producers responded to these societal changes by making large-scale structural changes to the show. By 2006, Sesame Street had become \\"the most widely viewed children's television show in the world\\", with 20 international independent versions and broadcasts in over 120 countries. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2006, it was estimated that 75 million Americans had watched the series as children. By the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children's show on television, and by its 50th anniversary in 2019, the show had 100% brand awareness globally. In 2018, the show was the second-highest- rated program on PBS Kids. Effect According to Davis, Sesame Street is \\"perhaps the most vigorously researched, vetted, and fretted-over program\\".Davis, p. 357 By 2001, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding its efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture.Cooney, p. xii The CTW solicited the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to conduct its summative research.Miekle, p. 85 ETS' two \\"landmark\\"Mielke, p. 88 summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies provided the majority of the early educational effects of Sesame Street and have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children. Additional studies conducted throughout Sesame Street's history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers. Lesser believed that Sesame Street research \\"may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children\\".Lesser, p. 235 He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige in the television industry of producing shows for children. Historian Robert Morrow, in his book Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television, which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw Sesame Street as a \\"straightforward illustration for reform\\".Morrow, p. 122 Les Brown, a writer for Variety, saw in Sesame Street \\"a hope for a more substantial future\\" for television. The networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many saw them as \\"appeasement gestures\\".Morrow, p. 127 In spite of the CTW's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television \\"made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods\\", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them.Morrow, p. 130 Morrow reported that by the mid-1970s, commercial television abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming.Morrow, p. 132 Other critics hoped that Sesame Street, with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers.Morrow, p. 124 As critic Richard Roeper has stated, perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of Sesame Street have been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially about Bert and Ernie. Critical reception Sesame Street was praised from its debut in 1969. Newsday reported that several newspapers and magazines had written \\"glowing\\" reports about CTW and co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney.Seligsohn, Leo. (February 9, 1970). \\"Sesame Street\\". New York Newsday. Quoted in Davis, p. 197. Although the series had been on the air for less than a year, Time Magazine featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail than any of the show's human hosts, on its cover and declared, \\" ...It is not only the best children's show in TV history, it is one of the best parents' shows as well\\". The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it.Morrow, pp. 119‚Äî120 A 2010 survey found that most parents supported their children's viewing of Sesame Street and other PBS educational shows, and many educators used them as aides in the classroom. > \\"Sesame Street is...with lapses, the most intelligent and important program > in television. That is not anything much yet\\". > > -Renata Adler, The New Yorker, 1972Lesser, p. 165 David Frost declared Sesame Street \\"a hit everywhere it goes\\". An executive at ABC, while recognizing that Sesame Street was not perfect, stated that the show \\"opened children's TV to taste and wit and substance\\"... and \\"made the climate right for improvement\\". By the end of the show's first season, ratings were high, the song \\"Rubber Duckie\\" was on the music charts for nine weeks, and Big Bird appeared on The Flip Wilson Show. Also in 1970, Sesame Street won twenty awards, including a Peabody Award, three Emmys, an award from the Public Relations Society of America, a Clio, and the Prix Jeunesse award.Morrow, p. 119 President Richard Nixon sent Cooney a congratulatory letter. Dr. Benjamin Spock predicted that the program would result in \\"better trained citizens, fewer unemployables in the next generation, fewer people on welfare, and smaller jail populations\\".Davis, p. 198 By 1995, the show had won two Peabody Awards and four Parents' Choice Awards. In addition, it was the subject of retrospectives at the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Modern Art. In 2002, TV Guide ranked the show number 27 on its list of the best television shows of all time; in 2013, TV Guide ranked the show number 30 on its list of the 60 best TV series. Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in 2009 for its website, sesamestreet.org, and the show was given Peabody's Institutional Award in 2019 for 50 years of educating and entertaining children globally. As of 2018, Sesame Street has won 189 Emmys. Joan Ganz Cooney, co-creator of Sesame Street and co-founder of the Sesame Workshop, in 1985 Sesame Street was not without its detractors, however. In May 1970, a state commission in Mississippi voted to exclude to host the show on its state educational TV network owing to concerns over the show's inclusive racial message. A member of the commission told the New York Times, that \\"Mississippi was not yet ready\\" for the show's integrated cast. Cooney called the commission's decision \\"a tragedy for both the white and black children of Mississippi\\". The Mississippi commission later reversed its decision 22 days later, after the vote had made national news. According to Children and Television, Lesser's account of the development and early years of Sesame Street, there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season. Lesser put the early criticism into four categories: educational goals, how the goals were chosen and obtained, the show's possible unintended effects, and its portrayal of minorities and women.Lesser, pp. 174‚Äî175 Historian Robert W. Morrow suggested that much of the early criticism, which he called \\"surprisingly intense\\",Morrow, p. 3 stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, \\"the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them\\". The \\"most important\\"Morrow, p. 146 studies that found negative effects of Sesame Street were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons. Both studies found that the show increased the educational gap between poor and middle-class children. Morrow reported that these studies had little impact on the public discussion about Sesame Street.Morrow, pp. 146‚Äî147 Social scientist and Head Start founder Urie Bronfenbrenner criticized the show for being too wholesome, stating, \\"The old, the ugly or the unwanted is simply made to disappear through a manhole\\". He also criticized the show for presenting bland and unrealistic characters, and for failing to teach children about social relationships and how to become a part of the society around them.Morrow, p. 145 Psychologist Leon Eisenberg saw Sesame Street's urban setting as \\"superficial\\" and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child.Morrow, p. 98 Head Start director Edward Zigler was probably Sesame Street's most vocal critic in the show's early years. He withdrew Head Start's funding of the show, becoming the first of CTW's original investors to do so. Morrow suggested that the basis of Zigler's criticism was concern that the federal government would transfer their funding of Head Start to CTW.Morrow, p. 147 Also according to Morrow, these studies were utilized by critics in Sesame Street's later years, especially by child development psychologists Jerome and Dorothy G. Singer, who insisted the television shortened children's attention spans, and by author Neil Postman in his book Amusing Ourselves to Death, who believed that television could not teach children.Morrow, p. 149 Postman claimed that Sesame Street also introduced children to a shallow pop culture, undermined American education, and relieved parents of their responsibility of teaching their children how to read.Davis, p. 200 Since federal funds had been used to produce the show, more segments of the population insisted upon being represented on Sesame Street. Morrow credited CTW's commitment to multiculturalism as one source for their conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists. These conflicts were resolved when the CTW added or substituted offending segments and characters. By 1977, the cast consisted of two African American women, one of whom was single, two African American men, a Chicano man, two white men, an American Indian woman, a Puerto Rican woman, and a Deaf white woman.Morrow, pp. 157‚Äî158 Emilio Delgado (Luis), who joined the cast of Sesame Street in 1971 Latino groups criticized the show for the lack of Hispanic characters during its early years. A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called Sesame Street \\"racist\\" and said that the show's bilingual aspects were of \\"poor quality and patronizing\\". According to Morrow, Cooney admitted that the show's bilingual elements were \\"not well thought out\\".Morrow, p. 154 By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-70s, Morrow reported that \\"the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words\\".Morrow, p. 155 In 1989, Sesame Street created a four- year \\"race relations curriculum\\" that focused on introducing its viewers to various cultural backgrounds. The New York Times reported that creating strong female characters \\"that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes\\"Gikow, p. 142 has been a challenge for the producers of Sesame Street. Davis reported that the National Organization for Women (NOW) expressed concerns that the show needed to be \\"less male-oriented\\". Members of NOW were \\"rankled by the portrayal of Susan, whom they saw as a subservient, powerless dispenser of milk and cookies\\".Davis, p. 213 In the spring of 1970, Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman objected to what she considered Sesame Street's portrayal of women and girls as passive. In late 1970, the NOW threatened to boycott the show.Morrow, p. 156 The show's producers satisfied these critics by making Susan a nurse and by hiring a female writer. According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on Sesame Street occurred slowly. CTW's research staff, which were mostly made up of women, worked with the mostly male production staff to raise their consciousnesses about how women and girls were portrayed in their scripts. Another source of friction between the CTW and feminists were the lack of female Muppets, for which they held Jim Henson responsible, as well as his organization of all- male puppeteers, who tended to create male characters. The demanding production schedule tended to attract only men, and Henson expressed his opinion that women were incapable of withstanding it. Gikow believed that the difficulty creating breakout Muppet characters was due to children's viewing styles: girls have tended to become attached to male characters they like, but boys did not tend to form the same attachments to female characters.Gikow, p. 143 The show's inventory of material, some of which many feminists found sexist and which were shown over and over, were slowly replaced by new, less sexist segments.Morrow, pp. 156‚Äî157 As more female Muppets performers like Fran Brill, Stephanie D'Abruzzo, and Leslie Carrara-Rudolph were hired and trained, stronger female characters like Abby Cadabby were created. As an interesting contrast, Sesame Street was also chastised by a Louisiana critic for the presence of strong single women on the show. In 1995, journalist Kay Hymowitz called Sesame Street \\"a triumph of appearance over substance\\" and credited its success not with quality, but with \\"a combination of savvy timing, sophisticated image making, and vigorous promotion\\". She held the show partly responsible for the declining verbal abilities of American students, and accused the show of affirming negative stereotypes about women. According to Hymowitz, the show's creators discouraged children's natural curiosity about the world. She criticized the show for, instead of transforming television, being \\"devoured\\" by it. She took issue with its use of cultural references, stating that the show taught young children to embrace the negative values of commercialism, celebrity, and anti-intellectualism. She insisted that by using television's production values, the producers of Sesame Street emphasized their \\"jazzy medium\\" more than the educational content they were supposed to convey. Hymowitz took issue with the show's educational claims, stating that Sesame Street diminished young children's readiness for reading by limiting their abilities to engage in analytical and creative thinking. She reported that most of the positive research conducted on the show has been done by the CTW, and then sent to a sympathetic press. She charged that the studies conducted by the CTW \\"hint at advocacy masquerading as social science\\". In 2003, one of Sesame Street's international co- productions, Takalani Sesame, caused some controversy in the US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. It marked the first time AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the U.S. surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, \\"The reaction we got in the US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean\\". The controversy in the U.S. was short- lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.

Its mission is the comparative study of European dictatorships and their transition to democracy. The foundation administers the Memorial and Education Centre Andreasstrasse, a museum housed in the former Stasi prison in Erfurt.Stiftung Ettersberg. Andreasstrasse. Retrieved 6 August 2019  History  The idea for the creation of the Stiftung Ettersberg goes back to the Spanish writer and dramatist Jorge Sempr√∫n. As a former prisoner of Buchenwald Concentration Camp he suggested in 1994, on the occasion of the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels award, to make use of the Ettersberg, on which Buchenwald Concentration Camp and afterwards the Soviet Special Camp No. 2 had been set up, as a point of reference symbolizing Germany‚Äôs double experience of dictatorship. He encouraged to take advantage of it with a European perspective in order to further the idea of democratic development in Central and Eastern Europe and of a European integration. The then minister-president of Thuringia, Dr Bernhard Vogel, took up this idea. On his initiative the Thuringian state government established the Stiftung Ettersberg, located in Weimar, in spring 2002 and the appointment of the executive board and the advisory council of the foundation.  Mission  The foundation is devoted to the comparative study of European dictatorships in the 20th century as well as their democratic transition. Its object is to contribute to the historical coming to terms with and the comparative analysis of dictatorships of fascist, national socialist and communist provenance as well as authoritarian regimes; it is to elucidate their mechanisms of rule and their driving forces. Moreover, it is dedicated to reveal the significance of opposition and resistance against authoritarian and totalitarian suppression and it keeps alive the memory of the victims of dictatorial violence. Besides, it is concerned with the problems of ‚Äúcoping‚Äù with the past and questions of transition from dictatorship to democracy as well as the stability conditions of liberal democracies. Accordingly, it is the task of the Stiftung Ettersberg to prospectively pursue historical research which does not only perform work of memory but goes beyond this by making successive generations sensitive for the latent danger to freedom and democracy. The Stiftung Ettersberg attempts to foster the international and interdisciplinary dialogue between political scholars, historians, and researchers in the field of social and cultural studies in Europe. It endeavours to disseminate national experiences internationally and thereby to make a contribution to the stabilisation of liberal democracy throughout Europe. It also aims at being a platform of international encounters, reflection, remembrance, encouragement and last but not least of a critical analysis of contemporary developments. From a European angle, the Stiftung Ettersberg organises international symposia, scientific conferences and colloquia, of which the results are issued in our own publication serial. In Thuringia, in the heart of Europe, the foundation promotes the dialogue between prolific university institutes, scientific and pedagogical institutions and other initiatives that operate in the field of dictatorship research and democratic transition processes. It organises exhibitions and initiates competitions for students on issues such as experience of dictatorship, stabilisation and endangering of democracy.

The film received widespread press coverage as a result of censorship of its disability themes.  Plot  Enlisted to teach a class of wheelchair- users about filmmaking, the neurotic Jasper gets a little more than he bargained for. His charges seem to know more than he does about his subject; they're not impressed by his own heartfelt social realist oeuvre; and they meet his every suggestion with the blank indifference peculiar to the streetwise adolescent.

Release  Released on 21 November 2008 (UK) Special People attracted National press with the BBFC classifying the film as a 12A for \\"moderate sex references, language, violence and disability theme.\\" Sparking criticism from cast and Disability groups that audiences should not have to be warned that a film has a disability theme.  Reception  Special People garnered widespread critical acclaim from critics and has a \\"certified fresh\\" score of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. The critical consensus states \\"Low budget British comedy which is sharply written and nicely acted whilst confounding disability misconceptions and prejudices on the way.\\" On its release The Guardian hailed Special People as \\"A milestone in mainstream cinema\\" for its use of disabled cast. The Radio Times called it \\" A triumph of understated, heartfelt humour\\" and the Daily Mirror \\"A little gem\\".

The race has usually been held each year since 1979 and is a Boston Marathon qualifying event.  History  The first Saskatchewan Marathon was run May 12, 1979. During the first two years, the marathon was held in May, however the date of the marathon was moved to October in 1981. The marathon continued to be run in the Fall until 2004, when it was moved to May in order to avoid competition in the Queen City Marathon in Regina, Saskatchewan. It has been held in May ever since.Saskatchewan Marathon - History In 2010 the event had a total participation of 2,797 runners, including: 159 runners in the Marafun, 1,404 in the 10 km, 1,287 in the Half-Marathon, and 247 in the Marathon. The 2020 in-person edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of running the race virtually or obtaining a 70% refund.https://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/2020-saskatchewan-marathon-cancelled-due- to-covid-19-concerns-1.4875873  Course  The Marathon courses have started and ended at a number of different locations since its inaugural event. All of the events have included the extensive portion along the South Saskatchewan River, including the east bank section from Ruth Street north to the Traffic Bridge and the west bank section from the Traffic Bridge north to Whiteswan Drive and beyond. A number of courses have included starts and finishes at Griffiths Stadium on the campus of the University of Saskatchewan, as well as portions of the course along roadways on the campus. The event in 2006 featured a start and finish at the east end of the Bowl, by the historic College Building. The various routes have been determined by a number of factors, including: road and bridge closures and construction, City and University approval and support, as well as the factors involved in choosing the location of the start/finish line. Extensive lobbying has occurred to develop a route which can remain unchanged from year to year, but that has proved impossible to do. The start/finish area is now at Diefenbaker Park and incorporates a river crossing on the South Circle Drive Bridge.

At the time, the country was a one-party state with the Mauritanian People's Party (PPM) as the sole legal party. Its leader, incumbent President Moktar Ould Daddah, was the only candidate in the presidential election, and was re-elected unopposed, whilst the PPM won all the seats in the National Assembly election. Voter turnout was 97.9%. They were the last elections held until the restoration of multi-party democracy in 1992. The elections were held during a time when Mauritania along with Morocco held a treaty to partition provinces of Western Sahara during 1975 while independence was fought in the province by Polisario Front. Daddah claimed that the winning the elections was a mandate for annexing the provinces of Western Sahara. Background Mauritania came under the direct control of the French Colonial Empire during 1933. After independence on 28 November 1960, the country declared itself the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, with Ould Daddah becoming its first President . He declared the country a one-party state in 1964, and in 1965 all parties merged into the ruling Mauritanian Assembly Party to form the Mauritanian People's Party (MPP). Daddah changed his stance from pro-French to nationalist during the early 1970s. He terminated the defense treaty with France in 1972, discontinued French currency bloc and nationalized French property. He also showed interest in annexing oil rich regions of Western Sahara, which was contested by Morocco and Algeria. A war erupted between Morocco and the Sahrawi national liberation movement, the Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with a government in exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Although Daddah initially allied with Algeria in opposing Morocco, during 1974, he realigned his position and is believed to have made a secret agreement with the king of Morocco. This eventually led to an agreement in 1975 that partitioned Spanish Sahara between Mauritania and Morocco.

Life Born on Christmas Day 1281 at Denbigh Castle, Alice was the only daughter and heir of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln and Margaret Longesp√©e, 4th Countess of Salisbury suo jure (in her own right). Her mother Margaret was the great-granddaughter and ultimate heir of one of the illegitimate sons of Henry II of England, William Longesp√©e (Longsword), whose nickname became his surname.Linda E., Portraits of medieval women: family, marriage, and politics in England, 1255-1350 Tragic accidents resulted in the deaths of Alice's two brothers in childhood. Edmund drowned in a well at Denbigh Castle and John fell to his death from a parapet at Pontefract Castle. This made Alice the presumptive heiress to two Earldoms, one from her father and one from her mother, which she would inherit if her parents had no further children. With Alice belonging to such an influential and wealthy family, king Edward I arranged for her betrothal \\"in her 9th year\\"Whitaker, T.D., History of the Original parish of Whalley and Honor of Clitheroe, 1872 to his nephew, Thomas of Lancaster, himself heir to the Earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester and Derby. They were married on 28 October 1294, when Alice was 13 years old and Thomas about 16. By this time, the probability of Alice's parents begetting a male heir had considerably diminished, and the marriage settlement reflects the strong probability that Alice would be one of the great heiresses of the land. The bulk of her vast inheritance from her father, which included the Earldom of Lincoln and many other estates, was to go to Thomas, with reversion to Thomas's heirs. In other words, even if Alice and Thomas had no children together, her estate would devolve upon her husband's heirs rather than upon her blood relatives. Als, if Alice outlived Thomas, then on her own death, her father's inheritance would pass to Thomas's heirs. This was because her father came to an agreement with the King that, should Alice have no children, her father's Earldom of Lincoln would pass into the royal family on her death.Warner, Kathryn Abandonment and Abduction: The Eventful Life of Alice de Lacy The marriage was not successful. The couple had no children, and they lived quite separate lives. Alice mostly lived alone in her castle of Pickering, Yorkshire, while Thomas took a host of mistresses, and fathered at least two illegitimate children. Countess Alice's mother died in 1309 or 1310,Death date of Margaret Longespee some fifteen years after the wedding. Alice inherited her titles and estates, and became the 3rd Countess of Salisbury suo jure (in her own right), while her husband Thomas became Earl of Salisbury jure uxoris (by right of his wife). A couple of years later, on the death of her father in February 1311, Alice became the 4th Countess of Lincoln suo jure (in her own right). Her husband, Thomas of Lancaster, became Earl of Lincoln jure uxoris (by right of his wife), inherited all the lands of Alice's father by right of his wife, and paid homage to Edward II of England for them shortly after his father-in-law's death. With the three Earldoms that he had inherited from his father in 1296, and the control of the two Earldoms of his wife, this made Thomas of Lancaster the richest and most powerful man in England. First abduction In the spring of 1317 Alice was abducted from her manor of Canford, Dorset, by some of the household Knights of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey and taken to the Warenne stronghold of Castle Reigate, though questions were raised by contemporary chroniclers over the degree to which Alice may have been complicit. The disreputable Warrene is thought to have carried out the abduction in order to humiliate Thomas of Lancaster, who had helped block Warenne's divorce, and had persuaded the Bishop of Chichester to prosecute Warenne for his adultery with his mistress which had resulted in Warenne's excommunication in 1316. There is a story that one of the Knights who abducted her on Warenne's behalf, described as an undersized hunchback named Richard de St. Martin, claimed that Alice was his wife on the ground that he had carried her off and married her before she was betrothed to the Earl of Lancaster. There can be no truth in this story as she was only \\"in her 9th year\\" when she was betrothed, and only 12 years old when she married Thomas. This story, however, shows the lengths to which Warenne may have stooped to humiliate Thomas. After Alice was abducted her husband Thomas then waged a private war on Warenne, but never once asked for Alice's return. Thomas also thought King Edward II, his cousin, had been involved in the planning of the abduction. It is not known when Alice was released, and her whereabouts from 1317 to 1322 are uncertain. Some also believe, based on an old ballad, that she divorced Thomas during this time. However, her subsequent treatment by the King indicates that she had remained married to Thomas. Thomas of Lancaster was captured at Boroughbridge after the failure of his rebellion against the King. On 22 March 1322 he was executed for treason at what had been Alice's family home of Pontefract Castle but that had become his favourite residence. With Thomas gone Alice should have had control of the vast inheritances from both of her parents for the first time. Thomas's estates were forfeited to the Crown, but that could not legally include the estates that he controlled by right of his wife and that were her inheritance. However, the King found other ways to punish the traitor's widow and confiscate her lands. Imprisonment A few days later in March 1322, the King had Alice arrested and imprisoned at York, along with her stepmother, Joan Martin, whose second husband, Nicholas de Audeley, had died 5 years earlier in 1316. (Joan died in October 1322.) Why Joan, who was a similar age to Alice was also imprisoned is unknown. It could have been out of spite from the King who in 1318 had accused Joan of \\"scheming to thwart\\" the hearing of a legal case,Richardson, D. & Everingham, K.E., Plantagenet ancestry: a study in colonial and medieval families or simply because she was there at the time of Alice's arrest. Imprisoned and under the threat of execution Alice surrendered into the King's hands on 26 June 1322, a great part of the lands which she had inherited from her father, in order to secure the confirmation of some portion of these possessions to herself. This was effectively the extortion by the King of her father's family estates that had been predated the Earldom of Lincoln such as Pontefract, though she was then permitted to hold some of her estates in life tenure by the king's \\"special grace\\". Many of her extorted estates were given by the King to the elder Hugh Despenser and his son Hugh Despenser the Younger, the King's nephew-by-marriage and favorite, who had both returned to England from exile in May 1322 and were now both involved in assisting the King in his attempt to \\"legally\\" obtain Alice's estates. Notably the elder Hugh Despenser was given Denbigh. To help add credence to the \\"legality\\" of the disposal of her lands to the Despenser's the King had Alice style Hugh le Despenser the younger as \\"kinsman\\". Alice was not released until she paid a staggering indemnity of ¬£20,000 to the Crown. Only by paying the indemnity was she to be allowed to remarry if she so wished, and to be granted those lands that remained of her inheritance. On 20 September 1322, Edward granted the Constableship of Lincoln Castle to Alice as her right and inheritance, and restored to her for life the annuity which her father had received in lieu of the third penny of the county of Lincoln. Her Earldom of Salisbury had reverted to the Crown in March 1322, but her Earldom of Lincoln was restored to her in December 1322. Even so, on her release Alice was placed on virtual house arrest for her \\"own protection\\". During this time she was compelled to dispose of more of her inheritance, this time from lands she had inherited from her mother. John de Warenne, the man who had abducted her in 1317, was given a life grant of many of her manors in the West, and Hugh Despenser the Younger was given one of her manors in Lincolnshire. Some of her many forfeited lands were returned to her, but only for life, by Edward III of England in 1331. Second marriage In 1324, possibly before Easter and definitely before 10 November, Alice married Eubulus le Strange. At the age of 42 it was not expected that she would bear any children to this union, and this was to be the case. This marriage appears to have been a loving, happy union. Eubulus described her in documents as his 'dear and loving companion' and never claimed the title of Earl of Lincoln by right of his wife as he was entitled to do. The King was worried, however, and required that all the estates that Alice had been forced to relinquish before this marriage had to be confirmed so that Eubulus could not make a claim on them by right of his wife. As a reward for Alice's co-operation the King confirmed the life grants he had made to Alice, and discharged her of her first husband Thomas's debts. In January 1327 Edward II, who had been imprisoned in 1326 by his Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, was forced to abdicate in favour of his son - it was generally believed that Edward II was then murdered by an agent of Isabella and Mortimer in September 1327. As her son Edward was still in his minority, Isabella became regent. Alice's estates that had given to the Despensers, reverted to Edward II in 1326 when the Despensers were executed by Isabella. Isabella now had control of these estates which nominally belonged to her son. Isabella appropriated for herself much of Alice's rightful inheritance, while Roger Mortimer took possession of Denbigh. In 1330, Edward III gained control of the government from his mother and Mortimer. He assumed most of Alice's inheritance and gave it, including the lordship of Denbigh, to William Montacute, his great friend who had helped him to overthrow Mortimer. Montacute also received Alice's earldom of Salisbury which had been taken from Alice in 1322. Since Alice's husband Eubulus was involved in Edward III's plot of 1330 to bring down Isabella and Mortimer, Alice and he were rewarded by the return of some of her estates. This was probably the most secure time in Alice's adult life. Alice and her second husband were the recipients of many honours, grants of land and money, and responsibility. Eubulus died in September 1335. In her mourning, Alice took a vow of chastity. Second abduction Alice, with her rich inheritance, did not remain a widow for long, though she was at this time 54 years of age. Late in 1335 or early in 1336 she was abducted from the castle of Bolingbroke and, ignoring her vow of chastity, 'raped' by Hugh de Freyne, Baron Freyne. (A letter from the Pope seems to reproach Alice for \\"allowing\\" the rape to happen.) Alice became de Freyne's wife before 20 March 1336. Historian Michael Prestwich describes the abduction thus, in his The Three Edwards: The marriage had taken place without the King's licence, so orders were sent to the Sheriffs of Lincoln, Oxford, and many other counties, to take into the King's hands the lands, goods, and chattels of Hugh de Freyne and Alice, Countess of Lincoln, and to keep the same until further order; the said Hugh and Alice having escaped from the castle of Somerton, where the King had ordered them to be kept separately, because Hugh took her from the castle of Bolingbroke by force. Apparently the offence was condoned, probably by payment of a fine, as an order was issued on 20 March 1336, to deliver to Alice and Hugh de Freyne a message at Newbury, Berkshire, and other manors were restored to her in the following year.Le Strange, Hamon, Le Strange records: a chronicle of the early Le Stranges of Norfolk and the March of Wales A.D. 1100-1310, with the lines of Knockin and Blackmere continued to their extinction (1916) Hugh de Freyne didn't live very long to enjoy her vast inheritance as he died in December 1336 or early 1337, and she returned to her vow of chastity. Second imprisonment On 4 May 1337 Alice complained that she had been imprisoned yet again. Eubulus's nephew and heir Roger le Strange (who would succeed on Alice's death to such property as Eubulus had held in his own right), together with Sir John de Lacy of Lacyes (Alice's illegitimate half-brother), and others, broke into her castle of Bolingbroke, imprisoned her there, took away 20 of her horses, carried away her goods, and assaulted her men and servants. The quarrel was made up with Roger before long, and on 20 June 1337, Alice obtained licence to grant to Roger her life estate in some manors that had been granted by the King jointly to Alice and Eubulus. Alice is referred to in documents of Edward II's reign (during the time of her marriage to Thomas, her first widowhood, and the early years of her marriage to Eubulus) as Lady Alice, or Alice de Lacy, Countess of Lincoln. In later life, she called herself Countess of Lincoln or Widow of Eubulus Lestrange. Alice lived until the age of 66 in October 1348 and was buried next to her beloved Eubulus at Barlings Abbey. A few months before her death, Alice's nephew-by-marriage from her first marriage to Thomas of Lancaster, Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, appeared as a petitioner on Alice's behalf in a legal action (an oyer and terminer) about vandalism to one of the estates. His actions, however, were not without personal motive as by her first marriage settlement he was the heir to the remaining lands that she held from her father's estate, and the legal action was about vandalism to and poaching from one of the estates that he was to inherit. Nevertheless, historian Linda Mitchell believes that his assumption of responsibility on Alice's behalf can be seen \\"as a mark of respect for the woman wronged so shamefully by his family.\\" For the last 10 years of her life, after the death by de Freyne, Alice also appears to have had the support of Edward III in that commissions of oyer and terminers that Alice requested during this time seem to have been promptly appointed and thoroughly investigated. Death Alice died childless at Barlings Abbey in 1348. Her Earldom of Lincoln became extinct upon her death. By the terms of her first marriage settlement, her remaining lands from her father's inheritance went to her nephew-by-marriage Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and remaining lands from her mother's inheritance were inherited by James de Audley, her Longespee cousin through his paternal line, who also happened to be her stepmother and father's widow Joan Martin's son from her second marriage. However, weighed against the extensive manors which Alice had once possessed in right of her inheritance as Countess of Lincoln and of Salisbury, she had comparatively little to leave after her death. Many of her lands had been forfeited to the Crown in 1322 and 1323, and for those lands that were restored she had accepted a life interest. Other grants of lands from the King jointly to Alice and her second husband, Eubulus le Strange, she held a life estate in after Eubulus' death, and these went to Eubulus' heir, his nephew Roger le Strange.

The mythological sun-arch above the base was inspired from Sanchi Stupas. The plaques embossed in it on four sides represent the greatness of the cause. Normally this type of plaque is placed on the head of the gods like Balaji, which means that they are Puja Arhulu. A few lines below the plaque and paid respects to Telangana martyrs, to convey that the martyrs were up there at highest level with their sacrifices. Above the sun-arch, nine strips or columns were carved denoting nine districts of Telangana. The specialty of this art piece is one can spot these nine strips from any side view. The meaning conveyed through it was nine districts of Telangana were united and nobody can disintegrate them. Next is the trapezium structure that has a dharma chakra, representing tolerance and truth, on four sides. The red granite represents sacrifice and the chakra for peace and love. The meaning conveyed through this was that Telangana youths sacrificed their lives while fighting for dharma, rights and justice. At the top, sculptor carved white lily flower to symbolize the freshness of youth and immortality of the soul. Normally flowers are kept near memorials. Yadagiri Roa said, \\"Fresh flowers were placed at the martyrs statue regularly. I realized that instead of depending on others, why not make a flower myself and keep at the statue forever. Therefore, I carved a white lily flower and placed it on top of the memorial\\".1969 movement symbolic structure gun park in Hyderabad.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1892 to 1895, but his parliamentary career was cut short when he fell out with the Liberal Party in his constituency. His business ventures failed, and he was made bankrupt.  Career  Fleming was the oldest son of Lionel Fleming of Manchester and Sale and his wife Anne, the daughter of Edward Rice Haywood from Liverpool. He was educated privately, and then joined the Indian Civil Service in Bombay, working in the financial department. He was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1872, and practised on the Northern Circuit, becoming a Queen's Counsel in July 1893. In 1869 he married Georgina Brown, the youngest daughter of James Brown from Eccles. He unsuccessfully contested the borough of Pontefract at the 1886 general election, and at the 1892 general election he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Doncaster division of the West Riding of Yorkshire, defeating the sitting Liberal Unionist MP Henry Wentworth-FitzWilliam.Craig, page 434 In January 1894 the Doncaster Liberal Council decided not to adopt him as their candidate for the next election, resolving: > \\"That, after what has transpired between their member of Parliament and the > executive, this meeting is of the opinion that Mr. C. J. Fleming, M.P. for > the Doncaster division of Yorkshire, no longer retains the confidence of the > Liberal party in the division. This Executive therefore recommend the > Liberal Council at its annual meeting to adopt another candidate for the > next election, while wishing Mr Fleming to retain his seat during the > present Parliament and the executive to take steps to secure another > candidate.\\" At the 1895 general election he stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate in the borough of Dudley.Craig, page 107 Meanwhile, Fleming had not practised law since 1891 or 1892, and had engaged in a series of unsuccessful business ventures. In 1891 he had become the owner of a newspaper called the Weekly Review, but it ran for only 13 weeks and he lost ¬£1,600. From 1893 to 1896 he was a director of a mining exploration company in Western Australia, and in 1897 obtained an option to purchase on two music halls in Paris. He hoped to profit from this by floating a company to take over the options, but flotation attempts failed in both London and Paris, and the options expired in November 1897. This failure combined with a fall in the value of his Australian shares to leave him bankrupt by 1898, although the Official Receiver concluded that the without the speculation in Paris, Fleming would probably not have become insolvent. In November 1898, Fleming's application for discharge from bankruptcy was opposed by the Official Receiver on the grounds that the debtor had contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations.

Born in Russia, and later moving to Berlin and then to Palestine, Engel has been called \\"the true founding father of the modern renaissance of Jewish music.\\"Heskes, p. 12. As a composer, teacher, and organizer, Engel inspired a generation of Jewish classical musicians to rediscover their ethnic roots and create a new style of nationalist Jewish music, modelled after the national music movements of Russia, Slovakia, Hungary and elsewhere in Europe. This style - developed by composers Alexander Krein, Lazare Saminsky, Mikhail Gnesin, Solomon Rosowsky, and others - was an important influence on the music of many twentieth-century composers, as well as on the folk music of Israel. His work in preserving the musical tradition of the shtetl - the 19th-century Jewish village of eastern Europe - made possible the revival of klezmer music today. Early life and work Engel was born, (and named Yuliy Dmitrievich Engel)Schr√∂der-Nauenberg (2007), p. 42 in Berdyansk, now in Ukraine. Unlike most Jewish families of the period, he grew up outside of the Pale of Settlement, the area designated by the Czar as legal for Jewish residence. His parents were secular Jews. Engel studied law at the Kharkiv National University, and later, at the urging of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who heard his compositions, entered the Moscow Conservatory.Ravina, p. 34. After graduating the conservatory, Engel worked as the music critic of the influential Russian newspaper Russkiye Vedomosti. He became an influential figure in Russian musical life, supporting composers who wrote in the increasingly popular Russian nationalist style. Interest in Jewish music According to Jacob Weinberg (1879-1956), concert pianist, classical composer and close associate of Engel's, Engel had no interest in Jewish music until a catalyzing meeting in 1899 with Vladimir Stasov, art critic and a leading proponent of Russian nationalism in art and music. According to Weinberg, Stasov shouted at Engel, \\"Where is your national pride in your own people?\\"Jacob Weinberg, \\"Joel Engel, a pioneer in Jewish music renaissance (personal recollections 1902-1927), quoted in Heskes, p.15. Engel experienced an epiphany, and took a profound interest in his Jewish musical roots. In the summer of 1900, Engel returned to his home in Berdyansk, and collected Yiddish folk melodies. The next year, he organized lecture-concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg, which included performances of the songs he had recorded and arranged. Engel dedicated the next years to gathering and arranging Jewish folk music, presenting concerts, and encouraging other Jewish composers to rediscover their national roots and create a Jewish national musical style. The St. Petersburg Society and The Dybbuk Hanna Rovina in The Dybbuk In 1908, Rosovsky, Saminsky and other associates of Engel founded the Society for Jewish Folk Music. Engel was instrumental in organizing their first concert, where many of his songs were performed. The society published the works of Engel and the other Jewish nationalist composers, and organized concerts throughout Russia. Several stars of musical life at the time, including violinists Jascha Heifetz (then a child prodigy) and Joseph Achron, pianist Leopold Godowsky and cellist Gregor Piatigorsky, participated in these concerts. In an article of 1914, Saminsky recalled the first concert of Engel's music in St. Petersburg, given under the auspices of the Society on 12 April 1909. > The young Jewish composers of St.Petersburg heard for the first time > Engels's artistic arrangements of Jewish folksongs [...] and were greatly > surprised that such cultural and national value could result from such an > enterprise. This concert stimulated the young Petersburg composers in the > following period to the creation and performance of a whole series of Jewish > song settings.Saminsky,–û–± –µ–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π –º—É–∑–∏–∫–µ (1914), cited in Schr√∂der- > Nauenberg Micah (2007), p.43 Engel with a phonograph used for recording Jewish folk songs In 1912 Engel joined S. Ansky in an expedition through the Pale of Settlement to collect folk songs of the Jewish communities. The researchers recorded the folksongs on wax cylinders using Thomas Edison's recently invented phonograph. This was one of the first uses of the phonograph in ethnomusicological research, a technique pioneered by B√©la Bart√≥k in Hungary four years earlier. Engel wrote the incidental music for Ansky's play The Dybbuk or Between Two Worlds. The play, about a young bride possessed by a spirit, was produced by the Habima Theatre, and became an international hit. The theater toured throughout eastern Europe with the play. Engel's score became well-known. He later worked the score into a suite for string orchestra and clarinet. It was Engel's first work for the stage, and his only large-scale work; his other compositions are songs and short instrumental pieces. Further cooperation between Engel and Habima never materialized, as the theater company experienced political troubles under the new post-revolutionary Russian regime, and was forced eventually to emigrate (first to America, and later to Palestine, where it eventually became the national theater company). Engel supported himself by working as a music teacher in a Jewish school outside of Moscow, where he developed a distinctive pedagogical approach. Rather than concentrating on music theory, he instituted a \\"listening program\\".Ravina, p. 67. \\"There is no need - and is boring to everyone - ... to teach that a second is dissonant and a third is consonant... Rather we need... to let [children] listen to good music, ... to learn to love, enjoy, and live it,\\" he wrote.Ravina, p. 86. The approach was the start of a revolution in music pedagogy. Berlin and Palestine Title page of a publication of Juwal. The cover sheet shows the logo that appeared on the Society's publications: a star of David enclosing a harp, flanked by a winged lion and a deer, recalling the Biblical verse \\"Strong as a lion, quick as a deer.\\" In 1922, the Society sent Engel on a mission to Germany, to promote the new Jewish music movement in the German Jewish community. Engel organized a series of concerts in Berlin and Leipzig, including performances of songs and instrumental works by Engel, Krein, Gnesin, Rosowsky, and others. Among the performers in these concerts was Gregor Piatigorsky.Ravina, p. 82. The following year, Engel opened the Juwal (Yuval) publishing house in Berlin. Juwal became the main publisher for composers of the society, printing editions of songs and chamber works in the new Jewish style. Yet, despite his intense activity in Germany as a composer, publisher and impresario, Engel was dissatisfied, and decided to move to Palestine. By now a renowned composer in the Jewish world, Engel's arrival was awaited anxiously by the Jewish community in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. He was offered a position teaching theory at the Shulamit music school, and there was some discussion of setting up a full conservatory under his direction. Engel moved to Palestine in 1924. In Palestine, Engel devoted himself to teaching and to composing, primarily children's and folk songs. Concerned that children's songs at the time were either European tunes with new words in Yiddish or Hebrew, or Yiddish songs from the shtetl, Engel tried to create a new, indigenous style. \\"How can we sing the song of the Diaspora in the promised land?\\" he wrote in a letter.Ravina, p.107. Many of his new songs were based on Yemenite melodies or motifs. During his life in Palestine, Engel also became associated with the Ohel theater group, one of the first theaters in Palestine. He wrote incidental music for the original play \\"Neshef Peretz\\", which toured the Jewish settlements of Palestine. He organized and conducted the Ohel choir, and wrote many new songs for choir and solo. His songs were popular, and were sung throughout Palestine. In spite of the warm reception he received, Engel had a difficult time adjusting to life in Palestine. \\"I was pampered in Moscow and Berlin,\\" he wrote in a letter in 1924. \\"... Here no one knows what Engel the composer wrote then, and what he is writing now.\\"Ravina, p. 102. His health gradually failed, and on February 11. 1927, he died in Tel Aviv. Engel's music Engel was one of the first - perhaps the first - musician to recognize that traditional Jewish music was not based on the major-minor tonal system that dominated classical and popular music of the period. \\"Most Jewish songs are built on the ancient modes (Aeolian, Dorian, Mixolydian, and so on),\\" he wrote in 1900.Ravina, p. 48. \\"Occasionally, one encounters major or minor; but more common are modes that are not written in our modern text books, and could be called 'eastern'.\\" This harmonic conception is apparent in Engel's compositions. For example, in the Dybbuk suite, opus 35, Engel uses an augmented fifth as the tonic chord, rather than a standard major or minor chord.Flamenboym, p.14. Aside from the Dybbuk suite, for string orchestra and clarinet, Engel wrote no orchestral music, and no large-scale works (symphonies, operas, concertos, and so on). His entire oevre is either piano solo, chamber works, or songs. He frequently used innovative combinations for his chamber music; for example, \\"Adagio Mysterioso\\", opus 22, is scored for violin, cello, harp and organ. He, like others of the Jewish art music movement, favored songs with obbligato string parts. The song \\"Ahava Rahya\\", for example, is scored for singer and violin, flute, viola and organ. Many of Engel's songs are based on traditional Jewish folksongs. For example, his cradle song (\\"sleep, sleep my child\\"), is a variant of a traditional Yiddish lullaby. However, Engel often draws on sources other than Jewish traditional music, as well. Ahava Rahya, cited above, is based on an Arabic melody, and many of the tunes he composed in Palestine are based on Yemenite songs. Engel's popular music, which during his lifetime dominated the popular music scene in Palestine, has been largely forgotten. Some of his songs, however, are still sung today. These include \\"Numi Numi\\", one of Israel's most popular lullabies; \\"Omrim Yeshna Eretz\\", the children's song \\"Geshem geshem mishamayim\\", and others.

Hettinger in 1919.Aerial Conductor for Wireless Signaling and Other Purposes United States Patent 1309031, published 1919-07-08, accessed 2010-12-15 Early practical examples of the technology used discharge tubes to contain the plasma and are referred to as ionized gas plasma antennas. Ionized gas plasma antennas can be turned on and off and are good for stealth and resistance to electronic warfare and cyber attacks. Ionized gas plasma antennas can be nested such that the higher frequency plasma antennas are placed inside lower frequency plasma antennas. Higher frequency ionized gas plasma antenna arrays can transmit and receive through lower frequency ionized gas plasma antenna arrays. This means that the ionized gas plasma antennas can be co-located and ionized gas plasma antenna arrays can be stacked. Ionized gas plasma antennas can eliminate or reduce co-site interference. Smart ionized gas plasma antennas use plasma physics to shape and steer the antenna beams without the need of phased arrays. Satellite signals can be steered or focused in the reflective or refractive modes using banks of plasma tubes making unique ionized gas satellite plasma antennas. The thermal noise of ionized gas plasma antennas is less than in the corresponding metal antennas at the higher frequencies. Solid state plasma antennas (also known as plasma silicon antennas) with steerable directional functionality that can be manufactured using standard silicon chip fabrication techniques are now also in development.Wireless at the speed of plasma New Scientist, published 2010-12-13, accessed 2010-12-14 Plasma silicon antennas are candidates for use in WiGig (the planned enhancement to Wi-Fi), and have other potential applications, for example in reducing the cost of vehicle-mounted radar collision avoidance systems. Operation In an ionized gas plasma antenna, a gas is ionized to create a plasma. Unlike gases, plasmas have very high electrical conductivity so it is possible for radio frequency signals to travel through them so that they act as a driven element (such as a dipole antenna) to radiate radio waves, or to receive them. Alternatively the plasma can be used as a reflector or a lens to guide and focus radio waves from another source.Plasma Antennas: Survey of Techniques and the Current State of the Art D C Jenn, published 2003-09-29, accessed 2010-10-15 Solid-state antennas differ in that the plasma is created from electrons generated by activating thousands of diodes on a silicon chip.

He was also the, 7th Baron of Pontefract, 8th Baron of Halton, 8th Lord of Bowland. Background He was the eldest son and heir of Roger de Lacy and his wife, Maud or Matilda de Clere (not of the de Clare family). Public life He was hereditary constable of Chester and, in the 15th year of King John, undertook the payment of 7,000 marks to the crown, in the space of four years, for livery of the lands of his inheritance, and to be discharged of all his father's debts due to the exchequer, further obligating himself by oath, that in case he should ever swerve from his allegiance, and adhere to the king's enemies, all of his possessions should devolve upon the crown, promising also, that he would not marry without the king's licence. By this agreement it was arranged that the king should retain the castles of Pontefract and Dunnington, still in his own hands; and that he, the said John, should allow 40 pounds per year, for the custody of those fortresses. But the next year he had Dunnington restored to him, upon hostages. John de Lacy, 8th Baron of Halton Castle, 5th Lord of Bowland and hereditary constable of Chester, was one of the earliest who took up arms at the time of the Magna Charta, and was appointed to see that the new statutes were properly carried into effect and observed in the counties of York and Nottingham. He was one of twenty-five barons charged with overseeing the observance of Magna Carta in 1215. He was excommunicated by the Pope. Upon the accession of King Henry III, he joined a party of noblemen and made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and did good service at the siege of Damietta. In 1232 he was made Earl of Lincoln and in 1240, governor of Chester and Beeston Castles. In 1237, his lordship was one of those appointed to prohibit Oto, the pope's prelate, from establishing anything derogatory to the king's crown and dignity, in the council of prelates then assembled; and the same year he was appointed High Sheriff of Cheshire, being likewise constituted Governor of the castle of Chester. Private life He married firstly Alice in 1214 in Pontefract, daughter of Gilbert, lord of L'Aigle, who gave him one daughter, Joan.Wightman, W. E., The Lacy Family in England and Normandy, 1066‚Äì1194 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966.), p. 261, Family History Library, 929.242 L119w. Alice died in 1216 in Pontefract and, after his marked gallantry at the siege of Damietta. He married secondly in 1221 Margaret de Quincy, only daughter and heiress of Robert de Quincy, son of Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester, by Hawyse, 4th sister and co-heir of Ranulph de Mechines, Earl of Chester and Lincoln, which Ranulph, by a formal charter under his seal, granted the Earldom of Lincoln, that is, so much as he could grant thereof, to the said Hawyse, \\"to the end that she might be countess, and that her heirs might also enjoy the earldom;\\" which grant was confirmed by the king, and at the especial request of the countess, this John de Lacy, constable of Chester, through his marriage was allowed to succeed de Blondeville and was created by charter, dated Northampton, 23 November 1232, Earl of Lincoln, with remainder to the heirs of his body, by his wife, the above-mentioned Margaret. In the contest which occurred during the same year, between the king and Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, Earl Marshal, Matthew Paris states that the Earl of Lincoln was brought over to the king's party, with John of Scotland, 7th Earl of Chester, by Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester, for a bribe of 1,000 marks.

The conviction was widely condemned as a miscarriage of justice, and was appealed three times, the conviction being quashed as a result of the third appeal.  Background  During late December 2009 and early January 2010, cold weather had resulted in considerable disruption across northern England. Robin Hood Airport in South Yorkshire was one of many airports which was forced to cancel flights. On 6 January 2010, an intending traveller, Paul Chambers, then aged 26, who was planning to fly to Northern Ireland to meet his then girlfriend (later wife), posted a message on Twitter: A week later, an off-duty manager at the airport found the message while doing an unrelated computer search. The airport management considered the message to be \\"not credible\\" as a threat, but contacted the police anyway. Chambers was arrested by anti-terror police at his office, his house was searched and his mobile phone, laptop and desktop hard drive were confiscated. He was later charged with \\"sending a public electronic message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character contrary to the Communications Act 2003\\". On 10 May, he was found guilty at Doncaster Magistrates' Court, fined ¬£385 and ordered to pay ¬£600 costs. He lost his job as a consequence, where he was employed as an administrative and financial supervisor at a car-parts company.  Response  A number of legal commentators and celebrities criticised the conviction and called for it to be overturned. They include journalist Nick Cohen, who drew comparison with Milan Kundera's anti-communist novel The Joke; television writer Graham Linehan; and the comedian and television presenter Stephen Fry, who offered to pay Chambers' fine and subsequent legal bills.  Appeals  Chambers lost an appeal against his conviction. Judge Jacqueline Davies, sitting with two magistrates, heard his appeal in Doncaster Crown Court; she judged that the tweet contained \\"menace\\" and that Chambers must have known that it might be taken seriously. Thousands of Twitter users responded by reposting Chambers' Tweet including the hashtag #iamspartacus, in reference to the climactic \\"I am Spartacus!\\" scene in the 1960 film Spartacus. A further appeal to the High Court was heard on 8 February 2012, in which the two judge panel of Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Irwin failed to reach a decision after initially reserving judgement. The \\"appeal by case stated\\" was made by Chambers' barristers, Ben Emmerson QC and Sarah Przybylska; David Allen Green, who acted for Chambers in earlier proceedings, also acted as his solicitor, through Preiskel & Co LLP. The appeal was entirely on points of law and centred on the correct interpretation of section 127(1) of the Communications Act 2003. Chambers (centre), with Al Murray (left) and Stephen Fry (right) outside the High Court on 27 June 2012 A second High Court appeal, before a panel of three judges, headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, opened on 22 June 2012. One of the arguments made by Chambers' barrister for this last appeal, John Cooper QC, was that if the tweet was \\"menacing\\" so was John Betjeman's poem, \\"Slough\\", pleading \\"Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!\\". He also asked whether Shakespeare would have been prosecuted if he had tweeted his line from Henry VI, Part 2 (Act IV, Scene 2), \\"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers\\". The latter reportedly drew laughter from the judges. On 27 June, the judges announced a reserved judgement. Chambers arrived at court accompanied by Stephen Fry and the comedian Al Murray. Chambers' conviction was quashed on 27 July 2012. The approved judgement concluded that \\"a message which does not create fear or apprehension in those to whom it is communicated, or who may reasonably be expected to see it, falls outside this provision [of the 2003 Act]\\". Accordingly, the appeal against conviction was \\"allowed on the basis that this 'tweet' did not constitute or include a message of a menacing character\\". It has been claimed by sources talking to the Guardian that staff at the Crown Prosecution Service had been in favour of dropping the case, to the point of informing Chambers, via his solicitor, that they would not oppose the final appeal, but had then been overruled by their head of service, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer. Chambers' MP, Louise Mensch, called for a House of Commons committee to investigate Starmer's behaviour. However the CPS said the decision was out of Starmer's hands as it was a crown court decision. Impact of the case The case led to a review of the guidance for the Crown Prosecution Service of their use of Section 127 and other speech related offences for online content, which attempted to narrow the use of the section in prosecutions. The 'grossly offensive' test has remained controversial and has been further reviewed by the Law Commission, who have examined online speech offenses to see where new powers may be needed.

The parish was founded in 1841 as St. John's Episcopal Church in Hartford. The church's present building, designed by famed architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, opened in 1909. It is noted for its reredos designed by Mr. Goodhue and executed by prominent sculptor Lee Lawrie;Wait, Gary E. A History of St. John's Church, 1841-1995.

Burnham Studios of Boston, Massachusetts, and London, England's James Powell and Sons.Church Records, St. John's Episcopal Church, West Hartford, CT. Congregation history St. John's Episcopal Church was founded in 1841, in downtown Hartford, Connecticut. Its first building was designed by Henry Austin (architect). An activist organization, St. John's was instrumental in the development of other prominent Hartford area churches including the Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House, St. John's Episcopal Church in East Hartford, and St. Monica's, the second Episcopal congregation in the state for African Americans. As the nineteenth century progressed, the western suburbs became increasingly popular as a place for city dwellers to live with the result that the number of St. John's worshipers was in decline. In 1907, financier J. P. Morgan purchased the church building and its property for the construction of a memorial gallery to be added to Hartford's Wadsworth Atheneum. The congregation then moved to suburban West Hartford, Connecticut, which was undergoing steady growth. Present church building The land for the current site, located adjacent to the main trolley line westbound from Hartford, was donated by longtime parishioners Dr. Thomas B. and John O. Enders. The firm of Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson was hired to design the new building with the assignment going to their New York Office headed by Mr. Goodhue. St. John's was the middle of three Episcopal churches designed by the New York Office in a relatively short period of time. The first was Christ Church in West Haven, Connecticut, and the last St. Mark's Episcopal Church (Mt. Kisco, New York) with each having a measure of similarity in the look of their exteriors and interiors. St. John's West Hartford held its first service in the new building on Easter Sunday, 1909. As initially built, St. John's consisted of the church and a small office wing. Mr. Goodhue's plan for the site included a number of additional features which evolved during subsequent upgrades. In 1914-5 a small parish house with an auditorium was added to the structure and in 1922-3 a reredos and high altar designed by Mr. Goodhue and executed by sculptor Lee Lawrie were made part of a significant improvement to St. John's interior. A major facilities upgrade occurred in 1927 with the addition of two bays to the church to alleviate overcrowding, the construction of a large parish house with an adjacent cloister garden, and the installation of an outdoor pulpit built into a Peace Cross. 1955 brought the addition of a chapel, with its own pipe organ, to hold the burgeoning church school. Fire On the night of October 10, 1992, a fire caused by spontaneous combustion of oil-soaked rags left in a maintenance room caused about $7 million of damage to the church's interior and exterior including the complete destruction of the stained glass window over the reredos (which itself was lightly affected), the auditorium, the 1950 Austin Organ, and its antiphonal of 1978. Other smoke and fire damage occurred throughout the structure, including the roof over the chancel and parts of the parish house. Church leaders moved forward to restore Mr. Goodhue's original designs as much as possible and to rejuvenate the infrastructure of the 83-year-old building. It reopened with a new altar window and auditorium, along with a large number of replaced or refurbished windows and furnishings, for services on April 16, 1995. The new organ was dedicated in 1996. Notable people Dr. John Franklin Enders (1897‚Äì1985), a member of an important St. John's family, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1954. He was Baptized at St. John's Episcopal in Hartford, and later became a confirmed member of the Episcopal Church at the parish's then new location in West Hartford. Following his death in 1985, St. John's arranged a graveside service at Fairview Cemetery in West Hartford, his birthplace.Church Records, St. John's Episcopal Church, West Hartford, CT. Among St. John's many notable clergy have been two assistants who later became Bishops: Walter Henry Gray of the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut and Kirk Stevan Smith of the Episcopal Diocese of Arizona. Prominent musicians affiliated with St. John's include organist and choirmaster Clarence E. Watters (at St. John's 1929‚Äì1932 and 1952‚Äì1976) who was one of Marcel Dupr√©'s \\"first and most enduring disciples-exponents- friends\\", and with whom Watters studied in Paris.Baglivi, Anthony. \\"Editor's Notes: Clarence Watters\\", American Organist, May, 1986, p.1 \\"One of [the 20th] century‚Äôs greatest organ virtuosos\\", Watters counted Charles-Marie Widor and other prominent organist/composers in his circle of friends and close associates.

It is known from 15 or fewer populations in southern Oregon and three populations in the Klamath Region of northern California.The Nature Conservancy It was described to science only in 2007.Wilson, B.L., et al. (2007). Description of Carex klamathensis (Cyperaceae), a rare sedge of the Klamath Region of Oregon and California. J. Bot. Res. Inst. Texas 1 69-77. Its habitat includes fens and other wet habitat, on serpentine soils. This sedge grows from a long rhizome bearing clumps of stems. The leaves are glaucous, 2‚Äì6 mm wide, with papillae between and sometimes over the veins. The inflorescence consists of 2-3(-5) spikelets. The terminal spikelet is usually staminate, occasionally androgynous, gynecandrous, or pistillate. Staminate terminal spikes are 1.3-2.7 cm long, 2‚Äì5 mm wide, with 40-190 flowers. Lateral spikelets are pistillate, (0.6-)1.5-2.5 cm long, 4‚Äì7 mm wide, the uppermost usually 1.5‚Äì6 cm or more below the terminal spike, but sometimes attached as close as 0.3 cm below the terminal spike. Pistillate flower bracts are reddish brown, dark brown, or rarely gold, the midrib and surrounding area green, white, or light brown, the edges sometimes pale, 1.9-2.8 mm long excluding awn. Perigynia (utricles) are obovate to elliptic, 2.1-3.6 mm long, (0.8-)1.2-1.6(-1.8) mm wide, light green, tan, or whitish, sometimes marked with dark brown distally, papillose particularly toward the beak or rarely smooth, the base succulent when fresh and drying withered, the beak usually curved, the distance from beak tip to top of achene (0.1-)0.4-0.7(-1) mm. Stigmas 3 (occasionally 2 on 0-5%(-15%) of perigynia that have viable achenes). Achenes trigonous (lenticular if stigmas 2). Inconspicuous Carex klamathensis is easily confused with Carex hassei, which typically has 2 stigmas per flower and lenticular achenes. Unfortunately, populations of Carex hassei sympatric with Carex klamathensis in the Klamath Region often have a mix two- and three-styled flowers that produce viable lenticular and trigonous achenes, respectively. Up to 2/3 of the flowers may produce trigonous achenes.Wilson, B.L., et al. (2008). Field Guide to the Sedges of the Pacific Northwest. Oregon State University Press. Carex klamathensis was discovered independently by botanists Peter Zika and Lawrence Janeway. Carex klamathensis is threatened by mining. In fact, most of one population has been obliterated by mining activities. Other threats include road building, recreational activities, and changes in drainage patterns.Wilson, B.L., et al. (2014).

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands in a small community alongside the B1106 road between Bury St Edmunds and Brandon. History The church dates from about 1100. During the 14th and 15th centuries new windows were installed to replace the 12th-century lancet windows. A porch was added in about 1500. By 1757 the church was in a \\"run down\\" condition, but it had been \\"put into good order\\" by 1829. Later in the 19th century a restoration was carried out between 1857 and 1866 by S. S. Teulon. This included work on the west front, the bellcote, the porch, the priest's doorway, the roofs, the pulpit and the reredos. Architecture Exterior All Saints is constructed in flint rubble, with freestone dressings. The roofs are tiled, and the porch is timber. Its plan is simple, consisting of a nave with a south porch, a chancel, and a bellcote at the west end. The church contains Norman features, while the windows added later are in Decorated style. The north and south doorways are Norman with round-headed arches; they are identical in form, and have Saxon influences. The tympanum of the south doorway contains a pair of lions with dog-like features surrounded by foliage. The north doorway is blocked, and its tympanum contains two human figures, one holding a ring. There is a grid-like object between them. It has been suggested that they represent Saint Catherine and her wheel, and Saint Lawrence with a gridiron. Interior The chancel arch is also Norman, as is the circular font. The benches date from the 15th century and have carvings. All the bench ends have poppyheads. Some of the benches have additional carvings, including representations of animals. One bench is carved on its back with wild boars, and figures having human faces but animal bodies. The rest of the fittings date from the 1888 restoration.

By the time they started the group in 1999, Stephan Mandrax and Sebastien Kohler were two brothers who blended their knowledge to form their genre, a modified disco infused house crossed with electro. History The 1980s Stephan 'Mandrax' Kohler, a fan of new wave and punk, made his 1984 DJ debut in a notorious music club called Dolce Vita in Lausanne. While in England he discovered house music, and two years later started to promote illegal parties on his return to Switzerland in order to Dj and play for large crowds, thus pioneering this new sound nationally by playing all over the country and around Europe, especially Paris. Early 1990s Stephan moved to New York City in 1992, starting the labels, Liquid Groove and Boombastic and with the American DJ, Mike Delgado. The label Liquid Groove garnered its first success with the H2O project: H20 feat Billie ‚ÄúSatisfied‚Äú, H20 ‚ÄúLiving for the Future‚Äú and H20 feat.

After a stint studying and working as a sound engineer in London, from 1993 to 1996, Sebastien also returned to Switzerland and started the Bel-Air Project and the label Cornflex, which lasted from 1997 to 2000. In 1998, he released a series of CDs including the single \\"Dark Jazzor\\", one of the earliest recorded songs to include a crossover of drum and bass incorporated with house. Recognising they had developed a complementary set of skills, the two brothers created their musical project, Shakedown. They started working together by producing tracks for other artists, before beginning to record a few demo songs with artists such as Pookie and the vocalist Terra Deva. Early 2000s After a year of recording sessions in New York City and Lausanne, their album, You Think You Know was released at the end of 2001 on Sony BMG. It included the track \\"At Night\\". \\"At Night\\" \\"At Night\\" became a 2002 dance anthem, crossing over to national charts and peaking in the UK Singles Chart at No. 6.

Background In the years before the Civil War, relations between the Dakota people and white settlers had deteriorated considerably. Once the War began, already scarce resources were further strained, and the supplies promised to the Dakota in \\"a series of broken peace treaties\\" were no longer available. Starving tribesmen attacked settlements in Minnesota, and in response, more than 400 Dakota and \\"mixed-blood\\" men were detained by Brigadier General Henry Hastings Sibley. 303 of these men were sentenced to death, but Lincoln reversed all but 38 of the death sentences for lack of evidence. Chaska's sentence was one of those commuted, but (because of an apparent case of mistaken identity) he was nevertheless executed. There has been some dispute over whether mistaken identity was to blame for Chaska's execution. There were three men held in Mankato on the day of the hanging called Chaska, which in the Dakota language means \\"junior\\" and is often used for a firstborn son. University of Oklahoma history professor and Little Crow biographer Gary Anderson believes soldiers \\"just grabbed the wrong guy\\". According to The New York Times, \\"We-Chank-Wash-ta-don-pee's case was No. 3 and not listed in the execution order handwritten by Lincoln... The man he died for was No. 121, identified by Lincoln as Chaskey-don or Chaskey-etay, who had been condemned for murdering a pregnant woman.\\" Others believe the execution was deliberate. During the war, Chaska had abducted a white woman, Sarah Wakefield, and her children. According to Wakefield, Chaska \\"kept them from certain death and abuse at the hands of his fellow tribesmen. 'If it had not been for Chaska,' Wakefield said, 'my bones would now be bleaching on the prairie, and my children with Little Crow.'\\" For her part, Wakefield \\"firmly believed that Chaska was executed on purpose, in retaliation for her testimony and in reaction to rumors that she and Chaska were lovers. General Sibley, who appointed the tribunal that convicted Chaska, privately referred to him as Wakefield's 'dusky paramour.'\\" Calls for a pardon A move has begun to award Chaska a posthumous pardon. According to the New York Times, the idea of a pardon has received a mixed (though largely positive) response from the Dakota community: Former Minnesota Congressman James L.

This reduces the number of pages accessed by up to a factor of ten for big heaps when using virtual memory, compared with the traditional implementation. The traditional mapping of elements to locations in an array puts almost every level in a different page. There are other heap variants which are efficient in computers using virtual memory or caches, such as cache-oblivious algorithms, k-heaps, and van Emde Boas layouts.  Motivation  Traditionally, binary trees are laid out in consecutive memory according to a \`n -> {2n, 2n+1}\` rule, meaning that if a node is at position \`n\`, its left and right child are taken to be at positions \`2n\` and \`2n+1\` in the array. The root is at position 1. A common operation on binary trees is the vertical traversal; stepping down through the levels of a tree in order to arrive at a searched node. However, because of the way memory is organized on modern computers into pages in virtual memory, this scheme of laying out the binary tree can be highly ineffective. The reason is that, as when traversing deeper into the tree, the distance to the next node grows exponentially, so every next node retrieved will likely be on a separate memory page. This will increase the number of page misses, which are very expensive. The B-heap solves this problem by laying out child nodes in memory in a different way, trying as much as possible to position subtrees within a single page. Therefore, as a vertical traversal proceeds, several of the consecutive retrieved nodes will lay in the same page, leading to a low number of page misses. Implementation In detail, a b-heap can be implemented in the following way. Poul-Henning Kamp gives two options for the layout of the nodes: one in which two positions per page are wasted, but the strict binary structure of the tree is preserved, and another which uses the whole available space of the pages, but has the tree fail to expand for one level upon entering a new page (The nodes on that level have only one child). In any case, an important point is that upon leaving a page, both child nodes are always in a common other page, since in a vertical transversal the algorithm will typically compare both children with the parent to know how to proceed. For this reason, each page can be said to contain two parallel subtrees, interspersed with each other. The pages themselves can be seen as a m-ary tree, and since half of the elements in each page will be leaves (within the page), the \\"tree of pages\\" has a splitting factor of \`pagesize/2\`. Parent Function In contrast to the classic array-like layout, the parent function in a B-heap is more complex because the index of a node's parent must be computed differently depending on where in the page it is. Assuming the positions inside a page are labelled from 0 to \`pagesize\`, the parent function can be as follows. For nodes 0 and 1, these are only used in the variant which is exploiting all possible space. In this case, the parent index of both nodes is the same, it is in a different page, and its specific offset within that page only depends on the current page number. Specifically, to compute the parent's page number, simply divide the current node's page number by the \\"page tree's\\" splitting factor, which is \`pagesize/2\`. To get the right offset within the page, consider that it must be one of the leaf nodes within the parent page, so start at offset \`pagesize/2\`. Then add the difference between the current page number, and the parent's page number, minus one since the first page after the parent page has its parent node in index (\`pagesize/2\`). For nodes 2 and 3, the parent is different depending on the mode. In space- saving mode, the parents are simply the nodes 0 and 1, respectively, so one needs only to subtract with 2. On the other hand, in strict-binary-tree-mode, these nodes are the roots of the page instead of 0 and 1, and so their common parent is computed the same way as described above. For all other nodes, their parent will be within the same page, and it is enough to divide their offset within their page by 2, not changing the page number.

Opened in June 1881, it was at the time the fourth longest in England, originally stretching a length of . When originally built, it was a T-shaped pier with a saloon/concert hall at the pier head. Steamboat trips ran from the pier to Norfolk until 1910. During World War II, the pier closed in an attempt to prevent enemy invasion. A severe storm in 1978 caused significant damage to the pier, isolating the pier head and shelters which were ultimately demolished in the mid-1980s due to the significant costs of restoration. A part of the pier caught fire whilst demolition was taking place. The pier has had various renovations in modern times, including redecking and waterproofing, allowing for operation during winter periods and permitting usage during rainy conditions. Location Skegness Pier is located on the B1451 Grand Parade Road and is around from Skegness railway station. The pier's main building also houses a bowling centre, laser quest and indoor children's play centre. History Planning Discussions about the possibility of constructing a pier began around November 1877, when a group of local businessmen met in the New Inn to discuss and consider whether Skegness should have a pier. Following approval, the Skegness Pier Company Limited was established to oversee the erection. A national competition was launched for \\"the best design of a Promenade Pier\\", with a prize of ¬£50 () for the winner, eventually being won by civil engineers Clarke and Pickwell. The proposal involved a cast-iron pier, wide, with a platform at the pierhead on which a concert hall to seat 700 people would be erected. Construction and opening With an estimated cost of around ¬£19,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), the foundations for the pier were laid in November 1879 with a planned t-shape design, including a concern hall at the head. It opened on Whit Monday on 4 June 1881 by the Duke of Edinburgh Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, at a cost of ¬£20,840 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and was one of the largest of the 82 piers constructed between 1815 and 1890 around the coastline of Britain. During construction, the Earl of Scarborough Aldred Lumley had taken an interest in the new pier company and by the time of opening, had become a majority shareholder. Shelters were erected along the decking at every few hundred yards. with small kiosks on either side selling seaside food and related items. Early years Skegness Pier between 1890-1900 Throughout the 1890s, the Skegness Pier Company was recorded over 100,000 annual admissions, managing to carry forward a balance of around ¬£400 each year. By 1899, a Jubilee clock had been erected on the promednade, funded by ¬£600 raised from public subscription costs. A popular boat trip from 1882 was a steamboat service that operated between the pier and The Wash and Hunstanton in Norfolk. Due to the popularity, local businessmen established the Skegness Steamboat Company to charter boats for the holiday season. Services ceased by the end of 1910 due to a buildup of sand at The Wash, which made the journey difficult and resulted in the removal of the unsafe landing stage. In March 1919, the pier was damaged by a drifting schooner vessel named Europa, creating a breach of with a temporary platform erected to cover the gap that would last until 1939, at which point a full restoration was completed, costing ¬£3272 (). Mid-20th century During World War II, the pier was closed and parts of the decking removed as part of policy to try and prevent invasions and did not reopen until 1948 following repairs, by then including a cinema, shops and an amusement arcade. At the pierhead was the Pier Saloon, renovated after the war and renamed The Pier Theatre several years later popular with visitors. The north east corner of the pierhead suffered damage during the North Sea flood of 1953, which was rebuilt at a cost of ¬£3000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). In the early 1970s, the pier entrance archway was demolished to make way for a new construction of shops and amusement arcades in 1971, as well as the pierhead theatre being enlarged from a seating capacity of 700 to 1,100. The pier was sold in 1976 to a local engineering company as the financial impact of the refurbishment works caused cashflow difficulties for the original pier company. Late-20th century The remains of the Skegness Pierhead cut off from the shore in 1979 after wind damages On Wednesday 11 January 1978, a northerly severe gale and storm surge brought disaster to Skegness Pier, along with other piers at Margate, Herne Bay and Hunstanton, causing irretrievable damage. The pier decking from the main entrance was reduced in length to , with the eastern shelters and the pierhead with its theatre isolated from the shoreline. Late in 1978, a plan to link the isolated pierhead by monorail and build a new 1200 seater theatre collapsed when an application for financial assistance was turned down. Debris from the wrecked pier was scattered for several miles around with souvenir hunters coming into the area to see what they could find. For several years following the storm, the isolated structures remained as features on Skegness beach whilst plans to repair the pier and relink the structures were sought. Proposals to reconnect the pier ultimately failed due to high costs and in 1983, the eastern shelters were dismantled and demolished. By 1985, the isolated pierhead was now derelict and was earmarked to be demolished, given the building was falling into a state of disrepair as the upper deck of the structure had been badly damaged following the 1978 storm, although it had become a roosting place for starlings. It was considered a risk to small shipping and also to the public. Due to its Grade II listed classification, special permission was granted to dismantle the pierhead in stages starting from October 1985, until a fire gutted the building. After the fire burned itself out, only the cast-iron stanchions were left and these were removed in January 1986. A year later in October 1987, high storm tides caused damage to the then-modern extensions that had been built throughout the 1980s, with securing of the pier's understructure needing to be undertaken before the following spring season. By the end of the 1990s, most of the extensions had been removed, revealing the Victorian pier framework. A variety bar in the entertainment centre was replaced by the bowling centre in 1992. Modern pier Skegness Pier main building entrance The present day pier length is long, with no remaining evidence of the former pierhead and shelters. A bowling alley was built in 1992 with a complete refurbishment programme starting in January 2000 to recapture its classic charm. Despite its much reduced length, it is a major landmark along the beach as far as Gibraltar Point to the south and Ingoldmells to the north. The pier deck was refurbished during 2005‚Äì2006 at a cost of around ¬£250,000. Further improvements were made during 2016-17 on the pier's seaward enclosed section, involving fitting new cladding to make it watertight and allowing the pier to open at weekends when demand requires. The contemporary pier comprises sections from various different periods, including the entrance pavilion from 1970, the central pierdesk dating back to 1948 and the main deck stretching along the beach being the original Victorian pier.

Career After being approached to do a concept album of hip-hop as it would sound in different time periods, Emcee Elemental created the character of Professor Elemental. While the album never came to fruition, the character stuck. Professor Elemental has since been seen performing as a solo act or in theatre acts such as Come into My Parlour. He is also popular at steampunk events and has been a headliner at the Steampunk World's Fair and the Waltz on the Wye. The Professor Elemental character first gained attention with his music video for \\"Cup of Brown Joy\\", directed by Moog, which got the attention of Warren Ellis. Since then he has released a new album, continued his work in the community and performed live. He was, for a time, in a friendly feud with fellow \\"chap- hop\\" artist Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer. However, Professor Elemental had a short appearance in Mr. B's music video for the song \\"Just Like a Chap\\", of which Professor Elemental said \\"much as I hate to admit it, I bloody love that video and am jolly glad [Mr. B] let me gate crash.\\" Mr. B reciprocated with a cameo on Elemental's video for his song, \\"I'm British\\" (which also featured appearances by members of the Eccentric Club, of which Elemental is a member). The two seem to have finally settled their differences in the track, \\"The Duel\\", on Elemental's 2012 album The Father of Invention, where, after a rap battle, both agree that the other is \\"jolly good\\" at what they do and go to enjoy a crate of sherry and some opium.

It became popularized when the Puritans began using it as a virtue name during the 17th century. Puritans also used Faith as part of longer phrase names, such as Be- faithful, Faithful, Faith-my-joy, and Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith. The name is also the usual English translation of the Greek name of Saint Faith, an early Christian child martyr who was tortured to death along with her sisters Hope and Charity. She is known as Pistis in Greek and Fides in Church Latin and her name is translated differently in other languages. Faith, Hope and Charity, the three theological virtues, are names traditionally given to triplet girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for twin girls. There were 40 sets of twins named Faith and Hope born in the United States in 2009, the second most common name combination for twin girls. In 2011, there were 33 sets of twin girls named Faith and Hope in the United States, the fourth most common name combination for twins. One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in Texas and were recognized in 1994 by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's longest lived triplets. Faith has been a consistently popular name for girls in the United States, ranking among the top 1,000 names since 1880 and the top 500 names since 1921. It has ranked among the top 100 names in the United States since 1999 and was ranked as the 71st most popular name for newborn girls in 2011. Other cultures also give names in reference to religious faith. The name Iman is used by Muslims for both boys and girls in reference to faith in Islam.

OUN was formed in Poland as an amalgamation between a number of extreme right-wing organizations including the Union of Ukrainian Fascists. From the moment of its founding in 1929, fascism played a central role in the organization, combining extreme ethno-nationalism with terrorism, corporatism, and anti-Semitism. The chosen assassin, Hryhorij Maciejko pseudonym \\"Gonta\\", was a trusted member of OUN. History The assassination plan was decided at an OUN meeting in Berlin. Maciejko was supplied with a makeshift bomb and a 7.65mm caliber pistol from Bandera. In the morning of 15 June 1934 Maciejko (age 31) appeared at the Foksal Street in Warsaw in front of a social club frequented by Pieracki. He waited there for several hours undetected. The minister arrived in his limousine at 3:30 p.m.; however, Maciejko's bomb failed. He pulled the gun and shot the minister from behind twice in the back of his head. Maciejko escaped successfully with the help of OUN emissaries all the way to Czechoslovakia and further to Argentina. The state funeral of Pieracki was attended by some 100,000 people. The coffin was sent to Nowy SƒÖcz in a special train and laid in his family tomb. The Polish authorities did not realize at first that OUN was behind the assassination, and blamed the Polish National Radical Camp (ONR) for it. The mistake had terrible consequences for Poland's political life. As a result of this, the Bereza Kartuska prison for dissidents was formed. Only a year later it became known that OUN was behind the assassination of Bronis≈Çaw Pieracki. The process of OUN leaders before a Warsaw circuit court took place between 18 November 1935 and 13 January 1936. Stepan Bandera, Mykola Lebed and several other members of the OUN were proven guilty of preparation of the assassination. The actual murderer, Hryhorij Maciejko, never faced justice. He died in Buenos Aires in 1966. Accused Front page of Kurjer Bydgoski from 20 November 1935 reporting on the beginning of court case against Stepan Bandera and his co-conspirators During the Warsaw process 16 members of the OUN were tried, including Stepan Bandera, Bohdan Pidhainy, Mykola Lebed, Yaroslav Karpynets, Mykola Klymyshyn, Dariya Hnatkivska, Yaroslav Rak, Yakiv Chorniy, Kateryna Zarytska, Ivan Malyutsa, Roman Myhal and Yevhen Kachmarsky.

The domains are color coded. For domains made up of discontiguous segments, each segment was assigned a number. Shown here are segments IV1 (orange), B1 (red), A1 (blue), C (pink), A2 (purple), B2 (yellow), and IV2 (green). Glucansucrase (also known as glucosyltransferase) is an enzyme in the glycoside hydrolase family GH70 used by lactic acid bacteria to split sucrose and use resulting glucose molecules to build long, sticky biofilm chains. These extracellular homopolysaccharides are called Œ±-glucan polymers. Glucansucrase enzymes can synthesize a variety of glucans with differing solubilities, rheology, and other properties by altering the type of glycosidic linkage, degree of branching, length, mass, and conformation of the polymers. Glucansucrases are classified according to the glycosidic linkage they catalyze. They can be mutansucrases, dextransucrases, alternansucrases, or reuteransucrases. This versatility has made glucansucrase useful for industrial applications. Glucansucrase‚Äôs role in cariogenesis is a major point of interest. Glucan polymers stick to teeth in the human mouth and cause tooth decay.  Structure  Glucansucrases are large, extracellular proteins with average molecular masses around 160,000 Daltons. Therefore crystallography studies have only been carried out for fragments of the enzymes, not complete structures. However, glucansucrase is very similar to Œ±-amylase, another sugar-cutting enzyme. Glucansucrase thus has many of the same structural features. For example, both enzymes have three domains in their catalytic core and a (Œ≤/Œ±)8 barrel. Glucansucrase has 5 major domains: A, B, C, IV, and V. The domains in glucansucrase, however, have a different arrangement than those in Œ±-amylase. The folding characteristics of Œ±-amylase and glucansucrase are still very similar, but their domains are permuted. Domains A, B, IV, and V are built from two discontiguous parts of the polypeptide chain, causing the chain to follow a U-shape. From the N- to C-terminus, the polypeptide chain goes in the following order: V, IV, B, A, C, A, B, IV, V (see figure at top right). The C domain is the only one made up of a continuous polypeptide sequence. Domain A contains the (Œ≤/Œ±)8 barrel and the catalytic site. In the catalytic site, three residues in particular play important roles for enzymatic activity: a nucleophilic aspartate, an acid/base glutamate, and an additional aspartate to stabilize the transition state. Domain B makes up a twisted antiparallel Œ≤ sheet. Some of the loops in domain B help shape the groove near the catalytic site. Additionally, some amino acids between domains A and B form a calcium binding site near the nucleophilic aspartate. The Ca2+ ion is necessary for enzyme activity.  Reaction and Mechanism  Glucansucrase has two parts to its reaction. First it cleaves a glycosidic bond to split sucrose. Products of the reaction are the constituent monosaccharides glucose and fructose. This glucose is added to a growing glucan chain. Glucansucrase uses the energy released from bond cleavage to drive glucan synthesis. Both sucrose breakdown and glucan synthesis occur in the same active site. The first step is carried out through a transglycosylation mechanism involving a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate in subsite-1. Glutamate is likely the catalytic acid/base, aspartate the nucleophile, and another aspartate the transition state stabilizer. These three residues are all highly conserved and mutating them leads to a significant decrease in enzymatic activity. Active site of glucansucrase in Lactobacillus reuteri The glucansucrase mechanism has historically been controversial in the scientific literature. The mechanism involves two displacements. The first originates from a glycosidic cleavage of the sucrose substrate between subsites -1 and +1. This releases fructose and forms a sugar-enzyme intermediate when the glucose unit attaches to the nucleophile. The second displacement is transfer of a glucosyl moiety to an acceptor, such as a growing glucan chain. The debate in the past was over whether the glucosyl group attached to the non-reducing or reducing end of an incoming acceptor. Additional investigations pointed to a non-reducing mechanism with a single active site.  Evolution  Glucansucrase proteins likely evolved from an amylase enzyme precursor. The two enzymes have similar folding patterns and protein domains. In fact, past attempts to produce drugs targeting glucansucrase have not been successful because the drugs also disrupted amylase, which is necessary to break down starches. This occurred because the active sites of the two enzymes are nearly the same. Glucansucrase likely maintained a highly-conserved active site as it underwent a different evolutionary path.  Health  Glucansucrase allows the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans to metabolize sucrose into lactic acid. This lactic acid lowers the pH around teeth and dissolves calcium phosphate in tooth enamel, leading to tooth decay. Additionally, the synthesis of glucan aids S. mutans in adhering to the surface of teeth. As the polymers accumulate, they help more acid-producing bacteria stay on teeth. Consequently, glucansucrase is such an attractive drug target to prevent tooth decay. If S. mutans can no longer break down sucrose and synthesize glucan, calcium phosphate is not degraded and bacteria cannot adhere as easily to teeth.  Industry  Bacteria with glucansucrase enzymes are used extensively in industry for a variety of applications. The polymer dextran is one prominent example of a very useful polymer. It is produced at commercial scale for uses in veterinary medicine, separation technology, biotechnology, the food industry for gelling, viscosifying, and emulsifying, in human medicine as a prebiotic, cholesterol- lowering agent or blood plasma expander, and more.

It is one of the commercial banks in the country, licensed by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the national banking regulator. Trust Bank is a small financial services provider in Zimbabwe. , the bank's total asset valuation was reported as US$38.5 million, with shareholder's equity of $14.8 million.December 2011 Financial Summary. Trust.co.zw. History The bank was founded in 1996 as Trust Merchant Bank. It transformed its banking licence to commercial banking licence in 2000, paving the way for its transition to Trust Banking Corporation. The bank grew rapidly, and by 2003, it had become the largest bank in Zimbabwe by balance sheet size. However, its growth came with several problems. As the Zimbabwean economy deteriorated, managers of the bank started in engaging in non-core activities. In 2004, it was closed down by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the national banking regulator. The assets of the bank were merged with those of Barbican Bank and Royal Bank Zimbabwe, both of which had also been shut down by RBZ, to form Zimbabwe Allied Banking Group (ZABG). The major reason was that the bank was illiquid and its managers had been irresponsible in managing depositors's funds. Prior to this corrective action, Trust has suffered a ZW$7 billion fraud committed by its own staff. This was attributed to weak controls and risk management systems. This worsened its liquidity position, which had hitherto started to deteriorate. In December 2003, banks such as Standard Chartered Zimbabwe and Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe began rejecting to settle Trust Bank cheques because of its precarious liquidity position. It was kicked out of the central clearing system several times. Following these incidents, Gideon Gono, the RBZ governor, demanded the resignation of William Nyemba (the then CEO), Nyevero Hlupo (who was then the Finance Director) and Chris Goromonzi (who was an executive director). This was a condition for the bank to get liquidity support from the RBZ. A new managing director, Philip Magwada was hired to manage the bank. He was instrumental in getting Trust Bank into ZABG. Following the dismissal, the dismissed executives challenged the amalgamation of Trust Bank assets into ZABG. Having gone through the litigation route, the cases were dismissed by the High Court and parties appealed to the Supreme Court, which culminated in the Supreme Court also dismissing the cases, but ruled that appellants had overlooked the need to, and must still, appeal to the Reserve Bank in the first instance, as provided by Law, against the alleged \\"sell\\" of the two banks' assets to ZABG. In September 2010, the RBZ reversed itself and re-issued the commercial banking licenses of the three banks that had been closed. ZABG also retained its banking license, bringing the total of commercial banks in the country to seventeen at that time. Trust Bank resumed banking business as a self- sufficient entity on 13 December 2010.Trust Bank Reopens Trust Bank Re-opens This Week , Trust Bank maintains a network of 10 branches.Branches of Trust Bank Zimbabwe.

Biography Ohm Ki-Young was born in 1951. It is known that his hometown is Chuncheon, Gangwon province but it is actually Chungju, Chungcheong province. He studied sociology and graduated from Seoul National University in 1974. He is known for his career as an MBC News anchor. He had preserved his position as an anchor for 13 years, which is the record for the longest news anchor in Korea. Magazine T, an entertainment class magazine, declared him the most influential person in broadcasting in their article \\"The influential TOP 30 of broadcasting in Korea' in May, 2008. Career Ohm started his career as a reporter in the social and economical department of MBC. He was in a plane crash in 1977 and nearly died. He got on a small plane to cover a local festival at Mt. Sorak but there was an accident. He was badly injured when the plane crashed. He was close to a vegetative state. Nonetheless, the cameraman and he were quite lucky to survive the accident. The captain and co-pilot died. He said \\"I have lived a second life since then. I believe that I live a life of the deceased as well as myself. I will make a return for this life by working for my country.\\" Ohm appeared on TV as a special correspondent to Paris in 1985. Then he attracted public attention because he always wore a trench coat when reporting news. His image was sophisticated to the Korean audience. A trench coat was unusual item for news correspondents in those days. Hence his colleagues and news audience gave him a nickname 'Burbbery Ohm'. In one interview, he said \\"At that time, the special correspondents' role was to show people the images of developed countries rather than to report stiff pieces of political news. That is because Korea was not such a developed country in 1980s and Koreans were eager to see 'the dream cities' on TV. Scenery of developed countries, that's what I showed people. Considering this role as a special correspondent, I preferred to wear a trench coat.\\" He became a news anchor in October, 1989. One of his expressions became popular, when he said \\"It is really absurd that this thing happened.(Ï∞∏ÏúºÎ°ú Ïñ¥Ï≤òÍµ¨ÎãàÏóÜÎäî ÏùºÏù¥ ÏïÑÎãê Ïàò ÏóÜÏäµÎãàÎã§.)\\" after announcing an outrageous incident. It was so funny that several comedians mimicked him on TV. As he had maintained his position of a news anchor for a long time, people thought he was a trustworthy person. IPS, the Institute for Industrial Policy Studies, chose him for the No.1 Brand Power in the TV anchor field from 2004 to 2007. The Brand Power means that a person functioned in a society like a brand of a company. Thanks to him, MBC Newsdesk recorded higher viewer ratings than KBS 9 o'clock News in January, 2007 for the first time. However, he made a serious mistake on July 26, 2007. He was reading the news that Taliban had abducted 23 Koreans. A moment before the camera turned to the special correspondent, Ohm accidentally smiled at the audience. Most of the audience was angry and condemned him for the accidental behavior. He made a public apology, \\"I apologize for making face.\\". Though he caught a lot of flak, the backlash was not that harsh owing to his good image. Ohm stepped away from the MBC Newsdesk in order to run for the position of MBC CEO. He was elected as president and CEO in March 2008. As a president, he introduced innovations to change MBC. In those days MBC was criticized because one of its programs, PD Notes, circulated a false and exaggerated report about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \\"mad cow disease\\") on April 29, 2008. After the broadcast, hundreds of thousands of Koreans held a candlelight vigil for two months. The production crews of PD Notes were indicted for the false reports. Ohm and MBC made an official apology. He pronounced the Plan for Innovation of New MBC to improve the company. Recent incidents On February 8, 2010, Ohm resigned from the presidency in protest against the unilateral selection of MBC board members by the Foundation of Broadcast Culture (FBC). MBC is 70% owned by the FBC, which in turn is controlled by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), whose chairman is appointed directly by the Korean president. Thus, Ohm's resignation was interpreted as an opposition to the political pressure from the administration of President Lee Myung-Bak. Ohm was praised for taking an independent line and standing firm in his belief. Since August, Ohm has been in negotiations with the Grand National Party who wish to nominate him as a candidate for governor of Gangwon-do province.

The brewhouse would be separated from the main buildings for many reasons, but importantly for fire security. Therefore the brewhouse could also be a place for washing clothes and baking bread.

It was originally a brewery.  History  The \\"manorial brewery\\" (herrschaftliches Br√§uhaus) was built in 1698 by the magistrate (Magistrat) and opened in the following year; it was redesignated in 1724 as a \\"free imperial town brewery\\" (freies reichsst√§dtischen Br√§uhaus). It is located in the town centre, within the historic town walls of Rothenburg, surrounded by town gardens and timber-framed houses, about 3 minutes from the market place. On 13 August 1804, Johann Georg Roth bought the brewery at auction and so it went into private hands for the first time. Since that time, the Br√§uhaus has changed hands several times. In 1905, master brewer Josef Beugler, the great grandfather of the present owner, became the proprietor of the brewery. In 1920, the brewery operation was moved to the steam brewery built by Hans Hopf in front of the Klingentor gate. The Br√§uhaus Rothenburg in Wenggasse became the malthouse as part of the new purchase and from then on became known as the Altes Brauhaus. Both businesses (outside the gate and in the town) were united and run as a single brewery under the name Brauhaus Rothenburg. Today, the cross barrel vaulting (Kreuztonnengew√∂lbe) in the brewhouse is a witness to the times of the \\"manorial brewery\\" in the days of imperial town rule. The beamwork of the roof gives an indication of the craftsmanship of master builders in times gone by. The house in Wenggasse was converted into a hotel in 1984.

He then tells the story behind the discovery of the Cosmic microwave background. After giving the reader a basis of understanding of astrophysics and particle physics, in chapter 5 of The First Three Minutes, as if setting the scene in a screenplay, Weinberg lays out the makeup of the Universe after its birth in a series of frozen frames.

The holotype specimen of Duriatitan, BMNH 44635, is a partial left upper arm bone which was found by R.I. Smith near Sandsfoot in the lower Kimmeridge Clay from Dorset. The type species, D. humerocristatus, was described in 1874 by John Hulke as a species of Cetiosaurus. The specific name refers to the deltopectoral crest, crista, on the upper arm bone, humerus. The specimen was assigned to its own genus by Paul M. Barrett, Roger B.J. Benson and Paul Upchurch in 2010. The generic name is derived from the Latin name for Dorset, Duria, and Greek Titan. Thomas Hotlz estimated its length at 25 meters (82 ft).

The \\"proper right\\" hand of a figure is the hand that would be regarded by that figure as its right hand.\\"For figurative works, use the abbreviations PR (proper right) and PL (proper left) to indicate the right or left side of the statue from the perspective of the statue (i.e., your right or left side if you were positioned on the base facing in the same direction as the statue)\\" - p. 34, Save Outdoor Sculpture!

In a frontal representation, that appears on the left as the viewer sees it, creating the potential for ambiguity if the hand is just described as the \\"right hand\\". The terms are mainly used in discussing images of humans, whether in art history, medical contexts such as x-ray images, or elsewhere, but they can be used in describing any object that has an unambiguous front and back (for example furnitureThe Furniture of John Shearer, 1790-1820: 'A True North Britain' in the Southern Backcountry) or,though see this somewhat puzzling example, which appears just to refer to the specific image, with the side shown the \\"front\\". when describing things that move or change position, with reference to the original position. However a more restricted use may be preferred, and the internal instructions for cataloguing objects in the \\"Inventory of American Sculpture\\" at the Smithsonian American Art Museum say that \\"The terms \\"proper right\\" and \\"proper left\\" should be used when describing figures only\\".Smithsonian American Art Museum, \\"Inventorying\\" section. In heraldry, right and left is always used in the meaning of proper right and proper left, as for the imaginary bearer of a coat of arms; to avoid confusion, the Latin terms dexter and sinister are often used. The alternative is to use language that makes it clear that the viewer's perspective is being used. The swords in the illustrations might be described as: \\"to the left as the viewer sees it\\", \\"at the view's left\\", \\"at the viewer's left\\", and so on. However these formulations do not work for freestanding sculpture in the round, where the viewer might be at any position around the sculpture. A British 19th-century manual for military drill contrasts \\"proper left\\" with \\"present left\\" when discussing the orientation of formations performing intricate movements on a parade ground, \\"proper\\" meaning the orientation at the start of the drill.Brigade drill, as established by order in the Field exercise and evolutions of infantry, as revised in 1859. With remarks and references, by W.N. Hutchinson, 1860, War Office, google books The terms are analogous to the nautical port and starboard, where \\"port\\" is to a watercraft as \\"proper left\\" is to a sculpture, and they are used for essentially the same reason. Their use obviates the need for potentially ambiguous language such as \\"my right,\\" \\"your left,\\" and so on, by expressing the direction in a manner that holds true regardless of the relative orientations of the object and observer.The origins of 'port' and 'starboard' at the UK National Maritime Museum website Another example is stage right and left in the theatre, which uses the actor's orientation, \\"stage right\\" equating to the audience's \\"house left\\".

In the late 1860s Dean Smith & Grace moved to Keighley, and exported machine tools across the Empire. Following Joseph Dean's retirement, the company traded as Smith & Grace of Thrapston, The Smith and Grace of Thrapston were different individuals sharing the same surname. The assumed connection between the 2 companies is probably false. but in 1908 a private company was reformed as \\"Dean Smith & Grace 1908 Ltd\\". By the early 20th century, Dean Smith & Grace had grown to be one of the leading heavy tool firms in Yorkshire. In response to the introduction of high speed steel around 1900, the company ceased building to customers' individual specifications and concentrated on a new type of steel geared lathe built for strength and rigidity. Herbert Smith, the aircraft designer who was responsible for designs such as the Sopwith Triplane, Camel, and Snipe worked for the firm in the years before the First World War. The company continued as an independent manufacturer until 1973 when bought out by the Monarch Machine Tool Company of Sidney, Ohio, USA. By this time the company was noted for equipping the engineering research laboratories and workshops at UMIST in Manchester. The same laboratory continues to use the same machines into the 21st century, citing them in their research publications. When Monarch went into bankruptcy the company was bought by Newsmith Stainless Limited of Roberttown, West Yorkshire, and now trades as Dean Smith & Grace Lathes UK Limited. In 2012 the company was acquired by the MTTG group. In April 2015, it was announced that Dean, Smith and Grace was to be moved to Halifax by MTTG.

The tower was built in the 11th‚Äì12th century, and the tower arch, the north arcade, and the chancel date from the 13th century. More alterations were made in the 17th and 18th centuries, including the demolition of the north aisle, and the addition of a new east window to the chancel. In 1829 a gallery and a gallery window were added to the nave. Other alterations made during the 19th century include the replacement of the south porch with buttresses. During the 20th century some rendering was applied to the exterior of the church, and further repairs were carried out. In 1927, the congregation stopped meeting in St Mary's, and began using St Barnabas church, a brick structure half a mile away in Barnetby. St Mary's fell into disuse, was declared redundant in 1972,and the Churches Conservation Trust now cares for it.Britain Express, retrieved 3 March 2018: http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=2591 In his well- regarded memoir, \\"No Moon Tonight, \\" Don Charlwood, an Australian navigator in RAF Bomber Command at nearby RAF Elsham Wolds in World War II, refers, movingly and repeatedly, to visits to St. Mary'ssee, for example, pp. 159‚Äì60.. Architecture Exterior St Mary's is constructed in a mixture of ironstone, chalk, limestone, and red and yellow brick. Cement rendering has been applied to parts of the nave and the tower. The roof of the nave is slated, and the roof of the chancel is tiled. The plan of the church consists of a three-bay nave, a three-bay chancel, and a west tower. The squat-looking tower is in two stages on a plinth. It has quoins and a moulded string course. In the west side of the lower stage is a round-headed doorway, over which is a small lancet window. In the upper stage there are small round-headed bell openings on the west and south sides, and a square-headed bell opening on the north side. In the north wall of the nave are the remains of two arcade arches, a 15th-century three-light window under a segmental arch containing Perpendicular tracery, and two plain three-light windows with mullions. On the south side of the nave are two buttresses between which is a round-headed gallery window. To the east of these are a narrow 11th-century round-headed window with a lintel carved in relief with a lion, and a large square-headed window dating from the 16th‚Äì17th century with four trefoil-headed lights. In the south wall of the chancel are a single lancet and a twin lancet window, between which is a blocked doorway. The east window is round-headed. Above the window is a gable containing red and yellow brick and rendering. Interior The tower arch is pointed and is partly obscured by the west gallery. The gallery is carried on a pair of wooden columns. On the south wall of the nave is a blocked round-headed doorway, and on the north wall is the blocked arcade. The chancel arch is pointed, and in the chancel is a blocked south door. The chancel rails are in two bays with a central opening; they were made from a former 15th-century oak rood screen. The wooden octagonal pulpit dates from the late 18th or the early 19th century, and contains painted panels. In the tower is a carved stone infant's coffin. The lead Romanesque font that was formerly in the church has been moved to the North Lincolnshire Museum in Scunthorpe. There is a ring of three bells, but these are no longer ringable. The oldest bell was cast in 1578 by Henry I Oldfield, and the other two were made in about 1599 by John Woolley. External features The churchyard contains war graves of three Royal Engineers soldiers of the First World War.

United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the prosecution's failure to inform the jury that a witness had been promised not to be prosecuted in exchange for his testimony was a failure to fulfill the duty to present all material evidence to the jury, and constituted a violation of due process, requiring a new trial.. This is the case even if the failure to disclose was a matter of negligence and not intent. The case extended the Court's holding in Brady v. Maryland,. requiring such agreements to be disclosed to defense counsel. As a result of this case, the term Giglio material is sometimes used to refer to any information pertaining to deals that witnesses in a criminal case may have entered into with the government.  Background  In June 1966, bank officials at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. discovered that Robert Taliento, a teller at the bank, had cashed several forged money orders. When he was questioned by the FBI, Taliento confessed that he had supplied John Giglio, the petitioner, with signature cards from one of the bank's customers, which Giglio used to forge $2,300 in money orders. Taliento then processed the forged money orders through the bank. An affidavit indicated that Assistant U.S. Attorney DiPaola struck a deal with Taliento, promising that he would not be prosecuted for the crime if he testified against Giglio. Taliento testified before a grand jury, resulting in Giglio's indictment. Giglio's trial, two years after the indictment, was prosecuted by a different prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Golden. DiPaola did not inform Golden of the deal struck with Taliento, and Taliento assured Golden prior to the commencement of the trial that no such deal had been made. In addition, U.S. Attorney Hoey personally consulted with both Taliento and Taliento's attorney prior to trial, emphasizing that Taliento would definitely be prosecuted if he did not testify, but that if he did testify, whether he was prosecuted would depend on the \\"good judgment and conscience of the Government.\\"Giglio, 405 U.S. at 153. At trial, Taliento testified \\"Nobody told me I wouldn't be prosecuted\\" and \\"I believe I still could be prosecuted.\\"Giglio, 405 U.S. at 151. The trial court did not attempt to reconcile the apparent conflict between DiPaola and Golden. It proceeded on the premise that even if DiPaola had made such a promise it was not authorized, and its disclosure to the jury would not have affected the verdict. Giglio was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. While his appeal was pending, his counsel discovered evidence of the government's discussions with Taliento. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the evidence that was not disclosed required a new trial under the due process criteria that had been enunciated in Napue v. Illinois and Brady v. Maryland.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court began its analysis by noting that deliberately deceiving the trial court and jury by presenting evidence known to be false had been held to be incompatible with the \\"rudimentary demands of justice\\" as early as Mooney v. Holohan.. In Napue, the Court had held that the same result occurs \\"when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\\" In Brady, the Supreme Court had held that, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution, suppression of material, exculpatory evidence required a new trial. In Giglio's case, the Court found that neither DiPaola's authority nor his failure to inform his superior Hoey or his associate Golden was controlling.Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154. The Court held that, regardless of whether the failure to disclose was intentional or negligent, disclosing the information remained the responsibility of the prosecutor in its position as spokesman for the government; and that a promise made by one attorney on the case must be attributed to the government. The Court noted that the government's case relied almost entirely on Taliento's testimony, and without it, there could have been no indictment, and no evidence to take to a jury. The Court found that this made Taliento's credibility an important issue; any evidence of an agreement or understanding with respect to Taliento's future prosecution was relevant to his credibility, and the jury was entitled to know about it.Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154-55. The Court held that due process required that Giglio be granted a new trial, and reversed and remanded.Giglio, 405 U.S. at 155.

United States"},{"id":"30048840","text":"The community health center (CHC) in the United States is the dominant model for providing integrated primary care and public health services for the low- income and uninsured, and represents one use of federal grant funding as part of the country's health care safety net. The health care safety net can be defined as a group of health centers, hospitals, and providers willing to provide services to the nation's uninsured and underserved population, thus ensuring that comprehensive care is available to all, regardless of income or insurance status. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 29 million people in the country (9.1% of the population) were uninsured in 2015. Many more Americans lack adequate coverage or access to health care. These groups are sometimes called \\"underinsured\\". CHCs represent one method of accessing or receiving health and medical care for both underinsured and uninsured communities. CHCs are organized as non-profit, clinical care providers that operate under comprehensive federal standards. The two types of clinics that meet CHC requirements are those that receive federal funding under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act and those that meet all requirements applicable to federally funded health centers and are supported through state and local grants. Both types of CHCs are designated as \\"Federally Qualified Health Centers\\" (FQHCs), which grants them special payment rates under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). To receive Section 330 grant funds, CHCs must meet the following qualifications: :*Be located in a federally designated medically under-served area (MUA) or serve medically under-served populations (MUP) :*Provide comprehensive primary care :*Adjust charges for health services on a sliding fee schedule according to patient income :*Be governed by a community board of which a majority of members are patients at the CHC CHCs place great value in being patient- centered. Uniquely in community health centers, at least 51% of all governing board members must be patients of the clinic. This policy creates interesting implications in terms of how \\"participatory\\" CHCs are, as governing board members become directly invested in the quality of the clinic. A sliding fee scale based on income is implemented so that the cost of care is proportionate to the patient's ability to pay. The purpose of these stipulations is to ensure that CHCs are working alongside the community, instead of just serving the community, in order to improve access to care. Community health centers that receive federal funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration, HHS, are also called \\"Federally Qualified Health Centers\\". There are now more than 1,250 federally supported FQHCs with more than 8,000 service delivery sites. They are community health centers, migrant health centers, health care for the homeless centers, and public housing primary care centers that deliver primary and preventive health care to more than 20 million people in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin.  History  According to historian John Duffy, the concept of community health centers in the United States can be traced to infant milk stations in New York City in 1901. In November, 1914, the city established the first district health center in New York at 206 Madison Avenue, serving 35,000 residents of Manhattan's lower east side. The staff consisted of one medical inspector and three nurses stationed permanently in the district who, through a house card system, developed a complete health record of each family.Duffy, John. In 1915, the system expanded, adding four district centers in Queens. Wartime and political pressures ended this development in New York City, but privately funded clinics through the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor were started in 1916 (Bowling Green Neighborhood Association), 1917 (Columbus Hill Health Center), 1918 (Mulberry Street Health Center) and 1921 (Judson Health Center). Founded by Eleanor A. Campbell in Greenwich Village, the Judson Health Center became the largest health center in the U.S. by 1924. The official establishment of community health centers was caused by the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) established what was initially called \\"neighborhood health centers\\" as a War on Poverty demonstration program. The aim of these clinics was to provide access points to health and social services to medically under-served and disenfranchised populations. The health centers were intended to serve as a mechanism for community empowerment. Accordingly, federal funds for the clinics went directly to nonprofit, community-level organizations. The health centers were designed and run with extensive community involvement to ensure that they remained responsive to community needs. Under the modern definition, the first community health center in the United States was the Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts, which opened in December 1965. The center was founded by two medical doctors - H. Jack Geiger, who had been on the faculty of Harvard University and later at Tufts University, and Count Gibson, also from Tufts University. Geiger had previously studied the first community health centers and the principles of community-oriented primary care with Sidney Kark and colleagues while serving as a medical student in rural Natal, South Africa. The federal government's Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) funded the Columbia Point Health Center, which served the poor community living in the Columbia Point Public Housing Projects located on an isolated peninsula far away from Boston City Hospital. On its twenty-fifth anniversary in 1990, the center was rededicated as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center and is still in operation. In 1967, Geiger and Gibson also established a rural community health center, the Tufts-Delta Health Center (now the Delta Health Center), in Mound Bayou, Bolivar County, Mississippi to serve the poverty-stricken Bolivar County. This center was also set up in conjunction with Tufts University with a grant from the OEO. While the Columbia Point Health Center was set in an urban community, the Delta Health Center represented a rural model, and included educational, legal, dietary, and environmental programs in addition to the health services carries out at the center and throughout the county by its public health nurses.Thomas J. Ward Jr., Out in the Rural: A Mississippi Health Center and Its War on Poverty (Oxford University Press, 2017) The War on Poverty enlisted many idealistic men, such as Leon Kruger, the first Director of the CHC at Mound Bayou. As a result, many families such as his, were drafted in the War on Poverty, often at their own risk. In the early 1970s, the health centers program was transferred to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). The HEW has since become the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Within HHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) currently administers the program. Since the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid, a challenge facing community health centers‚Äîand the health care safety net as a whole‚Äîis how to attract newly insured patients, who now have more options in terms of where to seek care, in order to remain financially viable. The evolution of the terminology used to describe what are now called \\"community health centers\\" is crucial to understanding their history and how they are contextualized in the United States social safety net. When they were titled \\"neighborhood health centers\\", heavy emphasis was placed on grassroots community involvement and empowerment. Since, the terms have shifted to \\"community health centers\\" and \\"Federally Qualified Health Centers\\", indicating how these clinics have transformed into government provisions, and are now subject to bureaucratization. While CHCs still retain their historical commitment to responding to community needs, through mechanisms such as requiring at least 51% of governing board members to be patients at the health center, their positioning as a government provision makes CHCs responsible for meeting federal requirements as well. Patient demographics Community health centers primarily provide health care to patients who are uninsured or covered by Medicaid. In 2007, almost 40% of all CHC patients lacked insurance, and 35% were Medicaid patients. In 2008, 1,080 CHCs provided comprehensive primary care to more than 17.1 million people. CHC patients typically have low family incomes, live in medically under-served communities, and have complicated health conditions. 70% of CHC patients in 2007 had family incomes of no more than 100% of the federal poverty level; more than 90% of patients had family incomes at or below twice the poverty level. Health center patients are also ethnically diverse. In 2007, half of all CHC patients were minorities, a third of which were Hispanic. All together, CHCs serve one in four low-income, minority residents. CHC patients are more likely to reside in rural areas relative to the rest of the population. They tend to be younger in age and are more likely to be female. In 2008, 36% of all CHC patients were children, and almost three in five patients were female. Many CHC patients suffer from chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, hypertension, or substance abuse. CHC patients are more likely to report these chronic conditions than adults from the national population. Characteristics linked to serious health problems, such as smoking and obesity rates, are also significantly higher in adult CHC patients compared to the general population. High rates of mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety, also contribute to the overall high rates of chronic illness in CHCs. Nonetheless, as of 2016, 91% of CHCs report having met at least one or more of Healthy People 2020 goals. Immigrants and community health centers Immigrants are some of the primary patients that community health centers serve due to the cultural and societal barriers the group experiences. From the 1970s up to the early 2000s, the effect on immigrant families has increased relative to families native to the U.S. due to factors such as parental education, parental employment, and racial/ethnic composition.Leung, ManChui R. Gender in Context: Immigrant Routes to Healthcare Access, University of Washington, Ann Arbor, 2018. However, immigrant families generally have a lower access to mental healthcare, leaving them at a greater risk to not treat their mental health issues. Part of this problem lays in the foundations of immigrant communities, as many non-Western cultures perceive a strong stigma towards mental health topics and lack a proper system of social support to address these issues. Even more common is the lack of understanding or awareness that these mental health help resources exist. Due to complexities in how insurance and healthcare works, which is compounded by language barriers, many immigrant families are unable to properly educate themselves on what services exist and how they may utilize these services. For those who are able to understand, lack of outreach may lead them to assume that they are ineligible, when, in fact, they are eligible to receive such services.Dz√∫rov√°, D., Winkler, P., & Drbohlav, D. (2014). Immigrants' access to health insurance: No equality without awareness. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 11(7). The effects of this lack of understanding especially harms immigrant children, who rely on their parents' knowledge of mental healthcare, who may inadvertently deny their children of needed mental health services.Huang, Z. J., Yu, S. M., & Ledsky, R. (2006). Health status and health service access and use among children in U.S. immigrant families. American Journal of Public Health, 96(4), 634-40.Gardner, N. S. (2015). Section 330(e) community health centers: A grounded theory study of primary barriers to utilization by the health insured as perceived by center professionals. ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. One proposed solution to this problem is through community health centers (CHC), which are able to provide a unique service experience for the population it serves. For many of these CHCs, they must adapt to the geographical space it inhabits, in addition to cultural and linguistic variations in the surrounding demographics. As a result, they are equipped to address social stigmas present in their communities, an obstacle that hinders the use of available mental health resources.Hunt, J. W., Jr. (2011). Community health center historical data and event analysis. ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. Additionally, CHCs also have the capability of overcoming local institutional barriers that may make it difficult or uncomfortable for immigrant groups to seek out healthcare. By providing translator services or linguistically appropriate health materials, for example, members of the local community are more empowered to educate themselves on mental health issues and solutions, as the information is provided in a form that is easily understood.Yang, J. S., & Kagawa-Singer, M. (2007). Increasing access to care for cultural and linguistic minorities: Ethnicity-specific health care organizations and infrastructure. Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved, 18(3), 532-49. Due to successes in some CHCs in impacting their communities, policies like the early 2000s Medicaid reform and the Bush Administration's health center initiative allowed for expansion of behavioral healthcare services in CHCs. Previously, there were large restrictions on reimbursement for these services, causing them to be very costly. However, the advent of such policies show a movement that trends towards further increases in healthcare accessibility.Wells, R., Morrissey, J. P., Lee, I., & Radford, A. (2010). Trends in behavioral health care service provision by community health centers, 1998‚Äì2007. Psychiatric Services, 61(8), 759-764. Policies like the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Chapter 58 have incrementally increased accessibility to healthcare, simultaneously setting a precedent for even further expansion.Boucher- Kjelland, C. (2012). Increasing accessibility to health care through government reforms: The history, politics and policies of health care reform in the united states. ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. Asian health services: Revive Chinatown! In the early 2000s, Asian Health Services envisioned a project called Revive Chinatown! that would create a safer pedestrian environment, while also transforming Oakland, California Chinatown's commercial district into a regional shopping destination. The key to securing the funding and support for this project was in re-defining the issue from one of public health into one of environmental justice. In doing so, Asian Health Services hoped to address the issue of pedestrian safety by simultaneously working on a long-term solution for increased quality of life. The Revive Chinatown! movement has gained traction and is cited as a success story of a CHC being able to successfully create a more public health-friendly environment, which bolsters their case and contributes to the trend towards further healthcare accessibility by means of CHCs.  Services  Integration of health care services is a major emphasis of community health centers, in addition to the provision of preventive and comprehensive care. Services provided can vary depending upon the site, but frequently include primary care, dental care, counseling services, women's health services, podiatry, mental and behavioral health services, substance abuse services, and physiotherapy. Often, CHCs are the only local source of dental, mental health, and substance abuse care available to low-income patients. Most recently, CHCs have played an increasing role in the opioid epidemic by facilitating access to treatment. CHCs have experienced an increase in the number of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) from 2015 to 2018. As part of the substance use disorders (SUD) component of services provided by CHCs, services have been added and expanded relating to the prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder. The number of CHCs that provide services for SUD has increased from 20% in 2010, to 28% in 2018. There has been a 36% increase in the number of full-time staff at CHCs who are trained to provide SUD services. As of the federal budget for the 2019 fiscal year, over $5 billion has been requested for the Department of Health and Human Services to use over the upcoming five years towards addressing the opioid epidemic. Of that request, $350 million has already been available for grants to be awarded by the start of the 2019 fiscal year. Because patients can come from a diverse range of socioeconomic, educational, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds, CHCs offer additional public health services unrelated to direct care, such as health promotion and education, advocacy and intervention, translation and interpretation, and case management. CHCs emphasize empowerment, so they also have programs to help eligible patients apply to federally funded health coverage programs, such as Medicaid. Additionally, CHCs place great emphasis on meeting community needs. To meet this goal, administrative and health care personnel meet regularly to focus on the health care needs of the particular community that they are trying to serve. Individual CHCs will often provide specialized programs tailored to the populations they serve. These populations could include specific minority groups, the elderly, or the homeless. To determine what the community's needs may be, CHC staff may decide to engage in community-based participatory research. The success of community health centers depends on collaborative relationships with community members, industry, government, hospitals and other health care services and providers.  Quality of care  Quality of care at CHCs can be assessed through many measurements and indices, including the availability of preventative services, treatment and management of chronic diseases, other health outcomes, cost effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. According to several studies, the quality of care at community health centers is comparable to the quality of care provided by private physicians. However, one major challenge that community health centers face is that the population that they serve is usually dealing with many other factors that can also detrimentally affect their health. As CHCs primarily treat the low-income and uninsured, many of their patients do not regularly see a primary care physician, which can lead to poorer health outcomes. Additionally, there is research to indicate that many CHC patients delay seeking health care because they hold a negative view of the health care safety net and expect discrimination from CHCs. It is crucial for CHCs to evaluate the quality of care they provide in order to meet federal requirements and to fulfill their mission of eliminating health disparities based on socio-economic and insurance status. Only recently has an evaluation program been instituted for CHCs. Such a program did exist briefly from 2002 to 2004; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and HRSA jointly monitored CHC providers. As of 2016, the HRSA utilizes the Uniform Data System to gather performance data from all health center grantees (FQHCs) and their look-alikes, which would include CHCs as well. Reporting instructions for the annual UDS report include information on patient demographics, clinical processes and outcomes, services, costs, and more. UDS data has been used to provide a health center adjusted quartile, which ranks the clinical performance of a health center in comparison to other health centers with similar characteristics such as minorities served, etc. In addition, external organizations such as The Center for Health Design, Kaiser Permanente, and the CDC also offer evaluation tools for CHCs.  Continuity of care  Community health center patients are less likely to seek medical care consistently, as many of these patients tend to be from vulnerable populations in terms of socioeconomic background and insurance status. Nevertheless, those who use community health centers as a regular source of care are likely to have a positive patient experience and receive high-quality preventative services. Medicaid's shift to managed care has helped create more medical homes for patients, allowing for greater continuity of care within CHCs.  Preventive services  Studies have indicated that CHCs provide preventive services at similar rates to private physicians. Preventative services studied included cancer screenings, diet and exercise counseling, and immunizations. CHCs performing higher than private providers in terms of immunization rates, but lower in terms of diet and exercise counseling.  Specialty care  Although CHCs are able to provide comprehensive primary care, they are limited in their ability to provide specialty care due to a lack of providers. The people affected most by this scarcity in services are the uninsured and Medicaid patients. In areas with a high uninsurance rate, which tend to be the medically underserved areas where CHCs operate, there is often a lack of availability of specialty care.  Chronic disease management  Compared with patients who receive care from private providers, CHC patients are almost three times more likely to seek care for serious and chronic conditions. However, with the exception of those with private insurance, CHC patients are also more likely to meet referral obstacles than comparable patients treated by private physicians. In one study investigated management of diabetes in CHCs, a majority of patients exhibited signs or symptoms of diabetes, but relatively few received comprehensive monitoring and management. Moreover, adherence to treatment protocols was low in CHCs, speaking both to the effectiveness of CHCs and to the social determinants of health that make CHC patients so vulnerable. Financing Community health centers rely on a combination of Medicaid payments, grant revenues, and other private and public funding sources to fund their operations. The sources of funding for health centers have changed significantly over time. Public Health Service Act grants under Section 330 were once a prominent source of funding for CHCs. Although 330 grants remain important to the financial viability of health centers, federal reimbursement policy under Medicaid has become their largest source of revenue. In 2008, Public Health Service Act grants comprised 18.3% of all CHC revenues. The expansion of CHCs has instead been largely funded by the growth in Medicaid resulting from eligibility expansions, coverage reforms, and modified payment rules. In 1985, Medicaid patients made up 28% of all CHC patients but only 15% of CHC revenues. By 2007, the share of Medicaid patients matched their share of revenues. In the same time period, grants for the uninsured decreased from 51% to 21%. In 2008, Medicaid payments had grown to account for 37% of all CHC revenues. In 1989, Congress created the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) program, which established a preferential payment policy for health centers by requiring \\"cost-based\\" reimbursement for both Medicaid and Medicare. The policy designated FQHC services as a mandatory Medicaid service that all states must cover and reimburse on a cost-related basis, using the Medicaid prospective payment system. The aim of these payment changes was to prevent health centers from using Section 330 and other grants (intended for the uninsured) to subsidize low Medicaid payment rates. The resulting payment structure reimbursed health centers on the basis of their actual costs for providing care, not by a rate negotiated with the state Medicaid agency or set by Medicare. Medicaid's shift to a managed care delivery system in the 1990s required CHCs to again modify their financial structure. The implementation of managed care in Medicaid was intended to curb costs while providing patients with greater freedom to choose where they access care. However, the shift had adverse financial implications on safety net providers. Health centers largely lost money in their early experiences of contracting and assuming risk for Medicaid managed care patients. Uncertainty about financial viability also lead to concerns about the ability of CHCs to continue serving the uninsured. In 1997, to protect health centers under managed care, Congress mandated that state Medicaid agencies make a \\"wrap-around\\" payment to FQHCs to cover the difference between their costs for providing care and the rates they were receiving from managed care organizations (MCOs). Since the initial shift to managed care, Medicaid has helped a wider group of patients access consistent medical care. The economic recession in the United States continues to pose significant challenges for community health centers. In 2002, President Bush launched the Health Center Expansion Initiative, to significantly increase access to primary health care services in 1,200 communities through new or expanded health center sites. However, these funds furthered disparity between CHCs, as they primarily benefitted larger, financially stable CHCs, rather than expanding and improving care in smaller clinics. In 2008, the Health Care Safety Net Act reauthorized the health centers program for four years with the expectation of expanding the program by 50% over the time period. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) appropriated $2 billion for investment in health center expansion. By 2010, assisted by funding received through the ARRA, health centers had expanded to serve more than 18 million people. The health center program's annual federal funding grew from $1.16 billion in the 2001 fiscal year to $2.6 billion in the 2011 fiscal year. Health centers served 24,295,946 patients in 2015. After the September 30, 2017 expiration of the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), 2018 funding finally passed in the House of Representatives and on November 6, 2017 was referred to the Senate Finance Committee as the CHIMES act.Galvin, Gaby. (5 December 2017). \\"Ignoring Community Health Centers Would Punish State Economies, Report Says.\\" US News and World Report website Retrieved 3 February 2018 The CHCF accounts for approximately 70% of available grant funding for CHCs, and represents approximately 20% of revenue. In anticipation of the delay in funding for the 2018 fiscal year, CHCs froze hirings, laid off staff, reduced hours of operations, and took other actions while facing funding uncertainty. On February 9, 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act authorized $3.8 billion for 2018, and $4 billion in 2019 for CHC funding. In addition, to address a shortage of family physicians in CHCs, the act also increased funding for HRSA's Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education (THC- GME) programs, which provides residency training in community-based primary care settings, rather than hospitals. Additionally, on August 15, 2018, HRSA announced that it awarded $125 million in grants via its Quality Improvement grant program to 1,352 CHCs.

Typical services covered are family practice and dental care, but some clinics have expanded greatly and can include internal medicine, pediatric, women‚Äôs care, family planning, pharmacy, optometry, laboratory testing, and more. In countries with universal healthcare, most people use the healthcare centers. In countries without universal healthcare, the clients include the uninsured, underinsured, low-income or those living in areas where little access to primary health care is available. In the Central and East Europe, bigger health centers are commonly called policlinics (not to be confused with polyclinics). Community health centers by country Canada Community Health Centers (CHCs) have existed in Ontario for more than 40 years. The first established CHC in Canada was Mount Carmel Clinic in 1926. Most CHC's consist of an interdisciplinary team of health care providers using electronic health records. In Quebec, local community services centers known by their French acronym, CLSC, offer routine health and social services, including consultations with general practitioners with and without an appointment. China Jimenli community health service center in Haidian District, Beijing in 2017 In China there are, as of 2011, 32,812 community health centers and 37,374 township health centers. Portugal The health center () was the basic community primary healthcare unit of the National Health Service of Portugal, as well as acting as the local public health authority. Usually, each health center covered the area of one of the Portuguese municipalities, but municipalities with over 15 000 habitants could be covered by more than one of these centers. Health centers were staffed with general practitioners, public health physicians, nurses, social workers and administrative personnel. In 2008, the more than 300 health centers were aggregated into around 70 health center groups (agrupamentos de centros de sa√∫de) or ACES. Each ACES includes several family and personalized healthcare units, these being now the basic primary health care providers of the Portuguese National Health Service. Besides family health care services, the ACES also include public health, community health and other specialized units, as well as basic medical emergency services. Some of the ACES were grouped with hospital units into experimental local health units (unidades locais de sa√∫de) or ULS. The ULS are intended to increase the coordination between the primary and the secondary healthcare, through both of these services being provided by the same health unit. United Kingdom Bertrand Dawson was commissioned by Christopher Addison to produce a report on \\"schemes requisite for the systematised provision of such forms of medical and allied services as should... be available for the inhabitants of a given area\\". The Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services was produced in 1920, though no further report ever appeared. The report laid down detailed plans for a network of Primary and Secondary Health Centres, together with detailed architectural drawings of different sorts of centers. By 1939 the term health center was widely used to refer to new buildings housing local health authority services. The Dawson report was very influential in debates about the National Health Service when it was set up in 1948, but few centers were built because \\"it was not practicable for local authorities to establish health centers without the full compliance of general practitioners\\" - which was not forthcoming. Far more attention and resources were devoted to hospital services than to primary care. From 1948 to 1974 local authorities were responsible for the building of health centers. A well known center was opened at Woodberry Down in October 1952. It had provision for 6 GPs, 2 dentists, a pharmacist and two nurses. It cost about ¬£163,000, which included the cost of a day nursery and child guidance clinic. This was regarded as extravagant and used as an excuse by critics for not building more. Harlow, where 4 centers were built by the new town corporation, was the only community in Britain served exclusively by doctors working from health centers. The few centers that were built \\"functioned as isolated islands in a sea of General Practitioners generally indifferent to their success\\". There were later calls to establish a network of centers to include not only GPs but also dentists and diagnostic facilities. In 1965 there were only 30 health centers in England and Wales, and 3 in Scotland. By 1974 there were 566 in England, 29 in Wales and 59 in Scotland. After the National Health Service Reorganisation Act 1973, responsibility for promoting health centers was transferred to Area Health Authorities and there were renewed calls to establish more Health Centres. It was suggested that these centers could arrange alternative medical care for patients \\"when their doctor is off duty, or for emergency calls when he is engaged elsewhere\\". Lord Darzi set up a network of Polyclinics in England when he was a minister in 2008. These clinics had some features in common with earlier proposals for health centers, but shared with them considerable resistance from GPs. United States A community health center is a not-for-profit, consumer directed healthcare organization that provides access to high quality, affordable, and comprehensive primary and preventive medical, dental, and mental health care. Community health centers have a unique mission of ensuring access for undeserved, under-insured and uninsured patients. In the U.S., Community Health Centers (CHCs) are neighborhood health centers generally serving Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) which includes persons who are uninsured, underinsured, low-income or those living in areas where little access to primary health care is available. Largely federally and locally funded, some health clinics are modernized with new equipment and electronic medical records. In 2006, the National Association of Community Health Centers implemented a model for offering free, rapid HIV testing to all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 during routine primary medical and dental care visits. Medically Underserved Areas/Populations are areas or populations designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as having: too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty and/or high elderly population. Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers and may be geographic (a county or service area), demographic (low income population) or institutional (comprehensive health center, federally qualified health center or other public facility).

Geiger (1935 ‚Äì October 3, 1989) was an engineer who invented the air- supported fabric roof system that at the time of his death was in use at almost half the domed stadiums in the world. Geiger was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a bachelor's degree from Drexel University, master's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and PhD in engineering from Columbia University. While an adjunct professor at Columbia University, Geiger designed the enclosure for the United States pavilion at Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan. He had been tapped after the architecture firm Davis Brody won the design contest for the building. Davis Brody's winning design was a 30-story high air filled \\"pumpkin\\" atop the pavilion and they needed an engineer with the expertise to implement it. Geiger was designing the US Pavilion to be capable of withstanding Japan's earthquakes and typhoons when Congress approved only half of the expected budget. To accommodate the new budget, he drastically cut the proposed height and used a low profile cable-restrained air-supported roof, employing a super-elliptical perimeter compression ring and diagonally-run pattern of cables which prevented fabric sag around the perimeter. Geiger's fabric air-supported roof invention was significantly cheaper than the largest fixed dome structure of the day: the Astrodome. He then joined with engineer Horst Berger to form Geiger Berger Associates and they went on to produce designs for a series of low-cost air-supported structures including the first tensegrity type dome for the Olympic Gymnastics Venue, Seoul, Korea (which had been inspired by the work of R. Buckminster Fuller), first translucent insulated fabric roof at Lindsay Park Sports Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, first ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù low profile air-supported fabric roof to cover a stadium at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. The partnership with Berger dissolved in 1983 and Geiger formed Geiger Associates, which was acquired by KKBNA in 1986.

Mission Essential got its start as the US government's leading provider of translators and interpreters. The company is based in New Albany, Ohio, with a significant office in Herndon, Virginia. Services Mission Essential's goal is to deliver operational solutions for high-consequence missions to defense, diplomatic, intelligence community and law enforcement customers, as well as multinationals and friendly foreign governments. The company helps customers combat terrorism, transnational crime, natural disasters, and other hazards to global security. Its three tranches of service are: Intelligence & Insight (such as All-Source Analysis and ISR operations), Development & Capacity Building (such as counter-narcotics and cultural advisory), and Readiness & Resilience (including emergency management, training, and continuity of operations). Due to the confidential nature of its work, Mission Essential does not highlight all of its accomplishments or clients. Intelligence and insight In August 2010, the U.S. Army named Mission Essential as a winner of a five-year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Intelligence Support Services contract, with a ceiling of $492 million. In September 2010, Mission Essential won a spot on the multimillion-dollar Intelligence Support Services ‚Äì Afghanistan (ISS-A) contract vehicle providing MULTI-INT operations in support of CENTCOM. The company won three task orders on ISS-A providing MULTI-INT operations support in March 2012 and another in September 2013.

The work is really important. Everything we do is to protect our nation's security.\\" Development and capacity building Mission Essential and its staff have assisted US security interests, including capacity building, counter-narcotics, multi-national law enforcement, and border management. The company's law enforcement subject matter experts has included former top DEA operative Mike Vigil, who infiltrated drug cartels during his decades with the DEA as detailed in his memoirs \\"Deal.\\" 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking In April 2009, Somali pirates hijacked the Maersk vessel Alabama and took the ship's captain and crew hostage. A Mission Essential interpreter assisted negotiation with the pirates during the crisis, alongside a Navy SEAL team. The linguist earned the pirates' trust, and after four days of negotiations, convinced the pirates to allow their boat to be towed behind the USS Bainbridge, until U.S. snipers killed three of the pirates and captured a fourth, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, rescuing the hostages and ending the crisis. The linguist was portrayed in the 2013 film Captain Phillips by Omar Berdouni. In an official statement, Mission Essential vice president Paul Clemens said, \\"The film only briefly touched on the heroic and crucial role our linguist played, but it's no stretch to say the mission could not have been completed without him. This is the case for most of the quiet heroes Mission Essential deploys. Our job is not to steal the spotlight but to lead from behind, which we've done every day for almost 10 years now.\\" Readiness and resilience Mission Essential also provides training and technical support to its clients, notably first responders. In spring 2010, it won a contract to teach the Air Force's Combat Airman Skills Training program, where instructors train airmen and women in basic combat and survival skills.

Recruitment The primary languages needed by the military in Afghanistan are Dari and Pashto. Recruiting U.S. citizens for security-cleared positions presents unique challenges because the last major wave of Afghan immigration to the U.S. was during the early 1990s. According to the 2000 Census, only 7,700 U.S. citizens speak fluent Pashto, and of those, Mission Essential says about half meet health and other clearance requirements. The company employs more than 1,000 of these citizens.

Mission Essential linguists have played a key role in coalition efforts to communicate with local populations. According to Reuters, \\"The 'terps,' as the soldiers call them in military slang, don't just do literal translations, they provide insights into local culture and customs that are key to any attempt to win the people over.

IMT is the lead technical support and sustainment provider for the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Enterprise, the Defense Department's worldwide satellite-connected communications network for transmitting tactical and strategic intelligence, lethal threat warning, and targeting data to Joint Service and Allied partner decision-makers and operators. Leadership Al Pisani has been Mission Essential's President since September 2018. Previously, Pisani worked for Serco Inc. as senior vice president, corporate development; spent almost five years as an SVP with TASC, leading its intelligence group; and held various leadership positions with Northrop Grumman, overseeing business development in the civilian sector and serving in its Homeland Security program management office. Charity Mission Essential made charitable giving a part of its corporate philosophy. Mission Essential's signature charitable event is its support for Ride 2 Recovery, which improves the physical and mental health of injured vets by using cycling for rehabilitation. In 2013, Mission Essential began a commitment to provide support, leadership, and volunteers to \\"help to continue to expand the organization's scope and draw attention to Ride 2 Recovery's vital mission.\\" In November 2013, Mission Essential donated $25,000 to Ride 2 Recovery at an Honor Ride to support America's injured veterans. In May 2014, Mission Essential sponsored the first annual Memorial Day Weekend Honor Ride in Central Ohio. The event enlisted more than 500 riders, raised $140,000, and generated considerable awareness, with coverage from local television affiliates. The Second Annual Honor Ride was held on Memorial Day Weekend, May 23, 2015, with over 900 cyclists participating and over $300,000 raised. In January 2013, Mission Essential donated $26,000 to the Wounded Warrior Project office in Fayetteville, NC, as a result of organizing the largest charity run in Afghanistan with more than 1,400 runners at US military bases in Bagram and Kandahar. Paul Clemens said, \\"As partners with the US military, Mission Essential recognizes their sacrifices, and the importance of supporting those who truly enable freedom. In one form or another, Mission Essential has contributed to several Wounded Warrior Project events, but none as impressive as this.\\" Mission Essential employees stationed in the Horn of Africa co- founded the Camp Lemonnier Cheetah Refuge Volunteer Program, which clears invasive tree species at the DECAN animal refuge and otherwise tend to the needs of the animals there, notably cheetahs and lions. Mission Essential's Scott Johnson said, \\"The ultimate goal of the refuge is to eventually release the animals back to the wild.\\" From 2010 to 2014, Mission Essential funded a scholarship program to provide tuition and accommodations for students at the American University of Afghanistan. Controversies Immigration visas Local National Linguists (LNLs) frequently apply for Special Immigration Visas to the United States, or for equivalent asylum with other friendly foreign governments. Mission Essential's ability to support these immigration requests consists of providing employment verification to the requesting government agency.  Danish government  In 2013, reports surfaced that the Danish government was missing information that it needed to process Mission Essential linguists, such as names and employment periods, who sought asylum in Denmark after helping the country's efforts in Afghanistan. The issue was quickly resolved. The Danish Minister of Defense Nicolai Wammen said, \\"Mission Essential will assist in validating information about employment for interpreters who make contact with the Danish authorities. This arrangement is similar to the arrangement which Mission Essential has with the US Government.\\"‚ÄúAgreement with Mission Essential‚Äù, \\"Danish Ministry of Defense,\\" August 21, 2013 Care of linguists MEP has been the subject of some critical media reports. In 2009, Corpwatch, a non-profit foundation focused on oversight of government contractors, accused the company of failing to care adequately for wounded local national linguists, including being slow to pay insurance benefits.Chatterjee, Pratap. ‚ÄúMission Essential, Translators Expendable‚Äù, \\"Corpwatch.org,\\" August 11, 2009 MEP countered that it \\"files all claims and intervenes on behalf of our linguists with insurance companies and claims investigators. ‚Ä¶ In cases where insurance payments are delayed, we directly intervene on behalf of our linguists to ensure our professionals get what they are due. When complaints of delayed payments first arose in 2009, MEP deployed Defense Base Act (DBA) insurance subject matter experts to Afghanistan to respond. At that time, there were 170 outstanding insurance claims. As of July 2010, there were 28. MEP's goal is always zero outstanding claims.\\" In fall 2010, Corpwatch's Pratap Chatterjee told Columbus Monthly, \\"I personally believe that MEP cares about the translators and tries to do a good job for them. The reality is beyond [then CEO] Chris Taylor's control.\\"Maag, Christopher. \\"War of words\\", \\"The Columbus Monthly,\\" November 2010, p. 105-106 Corpwatch also claimed MEP underpays its local national linguists (LNLs). In a fact sheet, the company said, \\"Local nationals are paid well by the standards of their community. MEP's LNLs are compensated better than doctors and cabinet-level officials in Afghanistan. MEP presently has a backlog of more than 600 Afghan nationals waiting to become linguists.\\" On The World of Troubles blog, journalist Jim Foley wrote that MEP was withholding pay from some linguists in dangerous areas. MEP responded that government regulations require a sometimes \\"cumbersome process which requires signatures from both MEP managers and military points of contact\\" and without those, pay cannot be disbursed. MEP further noted that the payroll problem had been successfully noted and resolved before Foley published his article. MEP has also been charged with deploying interpreters who were old or otherwise physically unfit.Schachtman, Noah. ‚ÄúUnlimited Talk, Only $679 Million: Inside the No-Bid Deal for Afghan Interpreters‚Äù, Wired, May 12, 2010 MEP's response was that it recruits, vets, and trains linguists according to the military's specifications, but does not control their final assignments throughout Afghanistan. ABC News report and lawsuit In September 2010, ABC News' Brian Ross quoted a former MEP employee who alleged in a whistleblower lawsuit that the company had sent unqualified linguists to Afghanistan two years earlier.Mosk, Matthew, Ross, Brian and Rhee, Joseph. ‚ÄúExclusive: Whistleblower Claims Many U.S. Interpreters Can't Speak Afghan Languages‚Äù, \\"ABC,\\" September 8, 2010 Disparate commentators criticized ABC's coverage of the story.

Nearly 18 months later, the survivor and family members of the deceased soldiers filed a lawsuit against MEP.Lardner, Richard. ‚ÄúMission Essential Personnel, U.S. Defense Contractor, Accused Of Negligence After U.S. Soldiers' Death‚Äù, \\"The Associated Press,\\" July 12, 2011 In response, MEP released a statement saying that the army had conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and found the shooting was \\"the result of the unforeseeable criminal acts\\" of the shooter, who had been vetted and approved by the US Government. MEP also noted that it had not issued Ahmadi a weapon nor authorized him to use one. Awards Mission Essential has won several awards. In its early days, it won a number of fast growth-related honors, such as Entrepreneurs of the Year for Emerging Markets in 2006 and the Business First Fast Fifty in 2007‚ÄúBusiness First announces Fast 50‚Äù, Columbus Business Journal September 14, 2007 and 2008.‚ÄúFast 50 Awards Luncheon‚Äù, Columbus Business Journal, October 2008 Mission Essential made Inc.

It covers approximately , and is thus the second-biggest park in the city. Overview Mayor Mauricio Macri surveys new playground installations in Indoamerican Park. Mayor Macri with neighborhood children in a new carousel at the park. Located on a flood-prone plain in what was, until the middle of the 20th century, the southwestern outskirts of Buenos Aires, the park began to take shape during the 1960s, when the area was designated as the Parque Almirante Brown redevelopment zone. The construction of public housing followed, and Mayor Francisco Rabanal had the Cild√°√±ez Stream tubed for flood control in 1966. The military-appointed administration of Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore announced plans in 1978 to convert the undeveloped plain into a public recreational area through two projects: the Parque de la Ciudad (an amusement park) and the Parque Zoofitogeogr√°fico. The latter would include an arboretum and be the new location for the Buenos Aires Zoo. The amusement park was inaugurated in 1982, but an economic crisis and irregularities in the contact for the arboretum's development and concession led to the project's cancellation (the zoo remained in its Palermo neighborhood location).Villa Lugano The park, located far from most of the city's residential or business areas, suffered from neglect in the ensuing years, and what would have been a reservoir along its northern end, Lake Soldati, became a shantytown known as Los Piletones.\\"Recordar√°n en un paseo a los ca√≠dos en Malvinas\\" La Naci√≥n UCR Councilman Carlos Louz√°n ultimately obtained passage of a resolution for the construction of a city park in the remaining areas 1993,\\"La ciudad ya tiene nuevo mapa\\" La Naci√≥n, 3 August 1999 and on December 1, 1995, Mayor Jorge Dom√≠nguez inaugurated the Parque Indoamericano.\\"El Indoamericano, el segundo m√°s grande\\" P√°gina/12: His successor, Mayor Fernando de la R√∫a, inaugurated the Paseo Islas Malvinas (\\"Falkland Islands Promenade\\") in April 1999.

Cabinet Chief An√≠bal Fern√°ndez stated \\"It's not a park. It's just a field with lots of weeds on it.\\" Flanked by shantytowns on both the northern and southern ends, much of the remaining prairie in the Indoamerican Park was occupied by squatters on December 9, 2010. A census of the occupants was conducted four days after the takeover, and reported 13,333 persons in the park; at least 80% of the more than 13,000 squatters, colloquially known as Okupas from ocupar in Spanish, had homes in one of the slums outside the park. Riots The squatters were mostly Bolivian and Paraguayan in origin, and reaction from the largely working class residents in the park's vicinity was, at times, violent. Two deaths among the squatters were reported: Bernardo Salgueiro (22 years old, Paraguayan) and Rosemarie Churapu√±a (28 years old, Bolivian) died. The deaths of 1 Paraguayan and 3 Bolivians were reported in Paraguayan media. Clashes between police and the squatters have left three people dead and 14 others injured according to CNN. The standoff also prompted a political conflict between the Mayor of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri (who was called a \\"xenophobe\\" by the President's Cabinet Chief, An√≠bal Fern√°ndez) and the President of Argentina, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. National Border Guards and the Navy's Albatross Special Forces secured the perimeter of the park and prevented the ingression of persons not previously living in the park and any construction materials. After an agreement between Macri and Kirchner in which the City will match funds provided by the central government to the squatters, Chief Cabinet secretary An√≠bal Fern√°ndez announced the clearing of the park via a Twitter post shortly after 6:30am local time. After initial deadlock in negotiations between the national and city governments, both jurisdictions eventually reached an agreement to clear the park of illegal inhabitants, including providing low-cost loans for housing construction to former squatters; the park was cleared by the morning of 15 December 2010. Reactions *The President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, called on Bolivians in the park to disperse, stating that their actions decrease the status of all Bolivians in Argentina. *Mayor Mauricio Macri called the incident \\"an uncontrolled migration\\" and said that the city government will continue working to \\"recover the park\\". *Mar√≠a Eugenia Vidal, the minister of social development, stated that the national government will continue to distribute food around the park. *Buenos Aires City Cabinet Chief Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta stated that \\"there is a mafia behind the situation at the Parque Indoamericano, which is trying to make a business by dividing the park into lots and offering the pieces of land to the neighbours of Villa Soldati\\", and that the squatters' leader Alejandro Salvatierra \\"is a Kirchnerite picketer that works for former education minister Daniel Filmus; Salvatierra is the one who encouraged the squatters to take the park.\\" See also * Villa Miseria References External links *Parque Indoamericano *flickr Villa Soldati, Villa Lugano, Buenos Aires December 11, 2010 *flickr Soldati / Lugano December 14, Buenos Aires December 14, 2010 * Parks and gardens in Buenos Aires 2010 in Argentina ","title":"Parque Indoamericano"},{"id":"30049086","title":"Mexicana Universal Nuevo Le√≥n"},{"id":"30049091","text":"Mychael Urban is a longtime Bay Area sportswriter and multi-media personality.

The theory involves a fermion X, and its antiparticle , both of which may couple into quarks in the visible sector, and into hidden particles in a hidden sector, a sector which is not part of the Standard Model. The hidden states have masses near a GeV and very weak couplings to particles in the Standard Model.

An excess of baryonic matter is created in the visible sector, and an excess of antimatter is created in the hidden sector. The hidden antimatter is explained as being stable dark matter. The X and particles have a conserved baryon number charge, so equal and opposite charges appear in the visible and hidden sectors. Therefore, the Universe's total baryon charge stays zero.

Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court on the issues of prescriptive sex discrimination and employer liability for sex discrimination. The employee, Ann Hopkins, sued her former employer, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. She argued that the firm denied her partnership because she didn't fit the partners' idea of what a female employee should look like and act like. The employer failed to prove that it would have denied her partnership anyway, and the Court held that constituted sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the mixed-motive framework that enables employees to prove discrimination when other, lawful reasons for the adverse employment action exist alongside discriminatory motivations or reasons.Goldstein, Leslie. \\"Gender Stereotyping and the Workplace: Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989).\\" 2006. The Constitutional and Legal Rights of Women, 3rd ed. Los Angeles: Roxbury, 2006. 167-75. Print.  Background  The plaintiff, Ann Hopkins, claimed she was denied partnership at the firm for two years in a row based on her lack of conformity to stereotypes about how women should act and what they should look like. Often co-workers described her as aggressive, foul-mouthed, demanding, and impatient with other staff members. During her evaluation, a written comment made by a firm partner stated that what Hopkins needed was a \\"course in charm school.\\" After her promotion was postponed for the first year, Hopkins met with the head supervisor of her department, Thomas Beyer, who told her that to increase chances of promotion she needed to \\"walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry.\\" Hopkins was well qualified for partnership, and frequently outperformed her male co-workers.Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, at 234. Many male employees said they would not be comfortable having her as their partner because she did not act the way they believed a woman should.Id., at 236. Ann Hopkins resigned from the accounting firm when she was rejected for partnership for the second year and sued Price Waterhouse for violating her rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Both the district court and the federal circuit court of appeals ruled in Hopkins's favor, but courts disagreed about the level of proof (preponderance of evidence versus clear and convincing evidence) that employers needed to provide to support their argument that they would have made the same decision absent their sex discrimination. The case was granted a writ of certiorari and heard before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Plurality opinion  An important issue in this case concerned the appropriate standard for finding liability in Title VII cases. Price Waterhouse argued that the employee must prove that the employer gave \\"decisive consideration to an employee's gender, race, national origin, or religion\\" in making an employment decision in order for the employer to be held liable, and that the employer could escape liability by proving that ‚Äî even absent the discriminatory aspects of the decisionmaking process ‚Äî the outcome would have been the same. Hopkins argued that the employer's use of discriminatory reasons in its decision-making process should be sufficient to trigger liability. The extent of the consideration, and the result of a hypothetical process not involving the discrimination, could be used to \\"limit equitable relief,\\" but could not serve as a complete defense as to liability.Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, at 237‚Äì238. The court's answer to this question was to compromise. They first introduced the term \\"but-for causation\\" to describe what Price Waterhouse suggests should be the burden of proof, but rejected its validity as an interpretation of the phrase \\"because of\\" in Title VII's section on prohibited actions.Id. at 240. They reasoned that the two are separate because Congress, in writing the provision, did not write \\"solely because of\\", and so, a process that only involved some small amount of discrimination would still be prohibited by the statute.Id., at 241. The court went on to explain that the employer should be able to escape liability if they can prove that they would have made the same decision, had discrimination not played any role in the process. The burden shifts, after the plaintiff proves that discrimination played a role, to the employer to make this rebuttal.Id., at 245. The court also elaborated on the meaning of \\"gender play[ing] a motivating part in an employment decision\\", saying that it meant that if, at the moment the decision was made, one of the reasons for making the decision was that the applicant or employee was a woman, then that decision was motivated by gender discrimination. This definition includes stereotypes based on sex, which previous definitions had not.Id., at 250. Another consequence of this case was that the employer's rebuttal as to the question whether a discriminatory judgment was the \\"but-for\\" reason for the decision could be made with only a \\"preponderance of the evidence\\", as opposed to the prior standard of \\"clear and convincing evidence,\\" a reduction in the burden of proof for employers who wish to escape liability.Id., at 253. Extension In R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that an employer who fires an employee for being gay or transgender violates Title VII, since it is considered sex discrimination.

But, she still prefers \\"Ayya.\\" She has studied in South Korea, Thailand and other countries, and has taught around the world, including at Bhikkhuni Sangha University in South Korea. Ayya Tathaaloka's mentor, Ajahn Maha Prasert of the Thai Forest Tradition, and many others encouraged her to open the first Theravadan women monastics' retreat in Northern California. In 2005, with community support, she opened Dhammadharini Vihara (a monastic residence) in the Niles District of Fremont, California, United States, and served as Abbess. She was honored with the 2006 Outstanding Women in Buddhism award, at the United Nations in Bangkok, Thailand.

C. Sharad, Kalapani's new ‚Äòline of control‚Äô, Nepali Times, 10 September 2004, p. 6 but is also claimed by Nepal since 1997. It's ours, The Economist, 2 July 1998. Ramananda Sengupta, Akhilesh Upadhyay, In Dark Waters, Outlook, 20 July 1998. According to Nepal's claim, it lies in Darchula district, Sudurpashchim Pradesh. The territory represents the basin of the Kalapani river, one of the headwaters of the Kali River in the Himalayas at an altitude of 3600‚Äì5200 meters. The valley of Kalapani, with the Lipulekh Pass at the top, forms the Indian route to Kailash‚ÄìManasarovar, an ancient pilgrimage site. It is also the traditional trading route to Tibet for the Bhotiyas of Uttarakhand and Tinkar valley. The Kali River forms the boundary between India and Nepal in this region. However, India states that the headwaters of the river are not included in the boundary. Here the border runs along the watershed. This is a position dating back to British India .: \\"The map 'District Almora' published by the Survey of India [during 1865‚Äì1869] for the first time shifted the boundary further east beyond even the Lipu Khola (Map-5). The new boundary moving away from Lipu Khola follows the southern divide of Pankhagadh Khola and then moves north along the ridge.\\" and : \\"The drainage area of the Kalapani lies wholly within British territory, but a short way below the springs the Kali forms the boundary with Nepal.\\" (Emphasis added) Nepal has another pass, the Tinkar Pass (or \\"Tinkar Lipu\\"), close to the area. After India closed the Lipulekh Pass in the aftermath of the 1962 Sino-Indian War, much of the Bhotiya trade used to pass through the Tinkar Pass.: \\"Lipu La, however, was closed in 1962, due to the strained Sino-Indian relations. Today remaining trade moves via Tinkar La.\\" The Nepalese protests regarding the Kalapani territory started in 1997, after India and China agreed to reopen the Lipulekh pass.Harsh Mahaseth, Nepal: The Different Interpretations of Crime, National Academy of Legal Studies and Research University, 10 March 2017, via Social Science Research Network. Since that time, Nepalese maps have shown the area up to the Kalapani river, measuring 35 square kilometres, as part of Nepal's Darchula District. A joint technical committee of Indian and Nepalese officials have been discussing the issue since 1998, along with other border issues. But the matter has not yet been resolved. On , Nepal released a new map of its own territory that expanded its claim to 335 square kilometres area up to the Kuthi Yankti river, including Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. It did not explain why a new claim arose.Sugam Pokharel, Nepal issues a new map claiming contested territories with India as its own, CNN, 21 May 2020.  Geography and tradition  According to the Almora District Gazetteer (1911) \\"Kalapani\\" (literally, \\"dark water\\") is the name given to a remarkable collection of springs near the Kalapani village. The springs rise from the north-eastern declivity of a peak known as Byans-Rikhi at an elevation of and flow into a stream in the valley (elevation: 12,000 ft). The stream, bearing the name \\"Kalapani River\\", is formed from two streams, says the Gazetteer, one rising from the western end of the Lipulekh Pass (Lipu Gad) and another from the western declivity of the Kuntas peak (Tera Gad). Modern maps show two further streams joining from the southeast, which arise at the Om Parvat and Point 6172 respectively. The latter of these, called Pankha Gad, joins the river very near the Kalapani village. Survey map of Kumaon (Surveyor: W. J. Webb, Draughtsman: Robert Tate, 1819) as published in the Historical Records of the Survey of India, 1954. The Gazetteer continues to state that the united stream of Kalapani flows five miles southwest, where it is joined by the Kuthi Yankti river that arises from the Limpiyadhura Pass (near the village of Gunji). After this union, the river is called the \\"Kali River\\". Language being not entirely logical, the term \\"Kali River\\" is often applied to the river from the location of the springs themselves. The springs are considered sacred by the people of the area and \\"erroneously\\" regarded as the origin of the Kali River. However, they had been regarded as a landmark by the British from the very first survey undertaken by W. J. Webb in 1816. The area on both sides of the Kali River is called Byans, which was a pargana (district in Mughal times). It is populated by Byansis, who speak a West Himalayish language (closely related to the Zhang-Zhung language once spoken in West Tibet).: \\"Geographically, the traditional Byans region is divided into two parts, Pangjungkhu, including Budi, Garbyang and Chhangru, and Yerjungkhu, consisting of Gunji, Nabi, Rongkang, and Napalchu. The Byans people recognize two varieties of their language, Pangjungkhu boli Yerjungkhu boli, which correspond to this geographical division, but the differences between the two are now minor.\\" The Byansis practise transhumance, living in their traditional homes in the high Himalayas during the summer and moving down to towns such as Dharchula in the winter. While high-altitude pastoralism is the mainstay of the Byansis, trade with western Tibet was also a key part of their livelihood.: \\"'The total trade of western Tibet with all parts of India, including Nepal and the native states, amount to about 90,000 annually, and of this the United Provinces and Tehri Garhwal get 70,000', reported Sherring in 1906, and the credit for this amazing success in trade entrepreneurship would go to these hardy Bhotia traders of Central Himalaya.\\" Both the Limpiyadhura pass and the Lipulekh pass were frequently used by the Byansis, but the Lipulekh pass leading to the Tibetan trading town of Burang (or Taklakot) was the most popular.: \\"The reference point defining the right extremity of Bhot Pradesh is another mountain pass, the famous Lipu Lekh, which was the most popular traditional gateway to western Tibet and to great Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage centers of Kailash and Mansarovar.\\" To the southeast of the Kalapani river is the Tinkar valley (presently in Nepal), with large villages of Changru and Tinkar. This area is also populated by Byansis. They have another pass referred to as Tinkar Pass that leads to Burang.: \\"On the Nepal side there is the Tinkar Pass, quite close to the Lipu Lekh, which is of about the same altitude and is approached by just as easy a route. However, the Tinkar Pass is of little use to Nepal, as this portion of that country is cut off from the rest of Nepal by impassable glaciers and mountains; it simply affords an alternative route to traders from Garbyang.\\"  History   Early 19th century  Garhwal and Kumaon in current-day Uttarakhand Following the Unification of Nepal under Prithvi Narayan Shah, Nepal attempted to enlarge its domains, conquering much of Sikkim in the east and, in the west, the basins of Gandaki and Karnali and the Uttarakhand regions of Garhwal and Kumaon. This brought them in conflict with the British, who controlled directly or indirectly the north Indian plains between Delhi and Calcutta. A series of campaigns termed the Anglo- Nepalese War occurred in 1814‚Äì1816. In 1815 the British general Ochterlony evicted the Nepalese from Garhwal and Kumaon across the Kali River, : \\"Ochterlony forced Amar Singh Thapa to agree at Malaun to terms under which the Nepali army retired with their arms, and the territory between the Kali and Sutlej rivers came under the control of the British.\\" ending the 25-year rule of the region by Nepal. Octherlony offered peace terms to the Nepalese demanding British oversight through a Resident and the delimitation of Nepal's territories corresponding roughly to its present-day boundaries in the east and west. The Nepalese refusal to accede to these terms led to another campaign the following year, targeting the Kathmandu Valley, after which the Nepalese capitulated. : \\"The Nepalese government initially balked at these terms, but agreed to ratify them in March 1816 after Ochterloney occupied the Makwanpur Valley only thirty miles from the capital.\\" : \\"[In 1816] With the collapse of the main defense line, the Darbar quickly dispatched Chandra Sekhar Upadhyaya to Ochterlony's camp with a copy of the Sugauli treaty bearing the seal of the Maharaja.\\" The resulting agreement, the Sugauli Treaty, states in its Article 5: Even though the Article was meant to set Kali River as the boundary of Nepal, initially the British administrators retained control of the entire Byans region both to the east and west of the Kali/Kalapani river, stating that it had been traditionally part of Kumaon.: \\"By treaty the Kali was made the boundary on the east, and this arrangement divided into two parts [the] parganah Byans, which had hitherto been considered as an integral portion of Kumaon as distinguished from Doti and Jumla.\\" In 1817, the Nepalese made a representation to the British, claiming that they were entitled to the areas to the east of Kali. After consideration, the British governor-general in council accepted the demand. The Byans region to the east of Kali was transferred to Nepal, dividing the Byans pargana across the two countries. Not being satisfied with this, the Nepalese also extended a claim to the Kuthi valley further west, stating that the Kuthi Yankti stream, the western branch of the head waters, should be considered the main Kali River. The Himalayan Gazetteer states that the surveyor W. J. Webb and other British officials showed that the lesser stream flowing from the Kalapani springs \\"had always been recognised as the main branch of the Kali\\" and \\"had in fact given its name to the river\\". Consequently, the British Indian government retained the Kuthi valley.: \\"The British settled this dispute by stating that the name Kaliganga is derived from the sacred waters of Kalapani. Therefore, Kalapani is the source and the [Kuthi Yankti] is only a tributary feeder. By doing this, Gunji and Nabi were annexed to the British territory. Tinker and Changru are the only Vyas villages that belong to Nepal since they undisputedly lie to the east of the River Kaliganga.\\": \\"The correspondence [on 8 March 1817] appears to indicate that, while the Zamindars resided on the west side of Kali in British India [in the Kuthi valley], their tenants lived on the east of the Kali River in Nepal.\\"  Late 19th century  The western Tarai regions (between Kali river to Rapti river, now called Naya Muluk) were returned to Nepal by British India, Some time around 1865, the British shifted the border near Kalapani to the watershed of the Kalapani river instead of the river itself, thereby claiming the area now called the Kalapani territory. This is consistent with the British position that the Kali River begins only from the Kalapani springs, which meant that the agreement of Sugauli did not apply to the region above the springs.: \\"India holds that the river Kali begins from the meeting point of the Lipu Gad with the stream from Kalapani springs\\" Scholars Manandhar and Koirala believe that the shifting of the border was motivated by strategic reasons. The inclusion of the highest point in the region, Point 6172, provides an unhindered view of the Tibetan plateau. For Manandhar and Koirala, this represents an \\"unauthorized\\", \\"unilateral\\" move on the part of the British. However Nepal was effectively a British-protected state at that time, even though the British termed it an \\"independent state with special treaty relations\\".: \\"Nepal during 1816‚Äì1923, Afghanistan during 1880‚Äì1919, and Bhutan during 1910‚Äì47 were British-protected states in all but name, but the British Government never publicly clarified or proclaimed their status as such, preferring to describe them as independent states in special treaty relations with Britain.\\" Around the same time that the British claimed the Kalapani territory, they had also ceded to Nepalese control the western Tarai regions. * pp. 46‚Äì47: \\"In return, the British restored to Nepal the western Tarai, taken in 1816, and conferred an honorary knighthood on Jang [Bahadur Rana] himself.\\" * pp. 54‚Äì55: \\"... the Ranas secured a steady rise in state revenue, which rose from around 1.4 million rupees in 1850 to perhaps 12 million in 1900, a substantial rise even allowing for inflation. ... Particularly important was the return to Nepal in 1860 of the western Tarai districts, which were initially very sparsely populated.\\": \\"The eastern Rapti river was returned to Nepal in 1817, and, in 1861, the Western tarai was also returned as recognition of Nepaiese assistance in quelling the Indian rebellion of 1857.[62] It is thus that Janakpur and Kapilvastu of hallowed memory are in Nepal and not in India.\\" Nepal's boundaries had moved on from those of the Sugauli treaty.Keshab Poudel, Demonstrations against Border Counterproductive, Spotlight, 13 November 2019.  20th century  A 1955 US Army map of the Byans region, with the Kalapani territory extending to the northeast A CIA map of the borders of Nepal, 1965, shows the Kalapani territory as part of India In 1923, Nepal received recognition from the British as a completely independent state. In 1947, India acquired independence from their rule and became a republic. Nepal and India entered into a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1950, which had a strong element of mutual security alliance, mirroring the earlier treaties with British India.: \\"The letters of exchange reminds one of the article seven of the treaty of 1815, and the article three of the treaty of 1923.\\" No changes in India's border with Nepal are discernible from the maps of the period. The Kalapani territory continued to be shown as part of India. Following the Chinese take-over of Tibet in 1951, India increased its security presence along the northern border to inhibit possibilities of encroachment and infiltration. The Kalapani area is likely to have been included among such areas. : \\"... an elected member of the National Panchayat from Byas, Bahadur Singh Aitwal, says that Indian security forces were present in Kalapani from 1959.\\" Nepal too requested India's help in policing its northern border as early as 1950, and 17 posts are said to have been established jointly by the two countries. Nepal Border Posts Abandoned by India, Daytona Beach Morning Journal, 29 December 1969. : \\"The extent of these precautionary measures is reflected in the rise in the cost of these defence posts from $42,000 (1952) to $280,000 (1954)\\".... \\"[25] The initiative reportedly came from Nepal. See Robert Trumbull in the New York Times, 16 February 1950.\\" Nepal expert Sam Cowan states that, from the date of its independence, India \\"has assumed and acted on the basis that the trail to Lipu Lekh fell exclusively within its territory\\". The 1954 Trade Agreement between India and China mentioned Lipulekh as one of the passes that could be used by Indo-Tibetan trade and pilgrimage traffic. Nepal was not mentioned in the Agreement.Nihar R. Nayak, Controversy over Lipu-Lekh Pass: Is Nepal‚Äôs Stance Politically Motivated?, IDSA Comment, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, 9 June 2015: \\"In effect, Lipu-Lekh has been a recognized trading and pilgrim route between China and India since 1954.\\" A State Police post was established at Kalapani in 1956, which remained in place till 1979, when it was replaced by Indo- Tibetan Border Police. The China‚ÄìNepal boundary agreement signed on 5 October 1961 states: So the trijunction of the India‚ÄìChina‚ÄìNepal borders was at the meeting point of the watersheds of Karnali, Kali and Tinkar rivers, which lies just to the west of Tinkar Pass. Tinkar Pass is where the Border Pillar number 1 of the China‚ÄìNepal border was placed, and still remains. After the 1962 border war with China, India closed the Lipulekh Pass. The Byansis of Kumaon then used the Tinkar Pass for all their trade with Tibet. In 1991, India and China agreed to reopen the Lipulekh pass, and the trade through it steadily increased.: \\"India and China opened their first border trade route way back in 1991 between Dharachula in Uttaranchal and Pulan [Purang] in Tibet through the Lipulekh Pass.\\": \\"The governments of India and China agreed to establish border trade at Pulan in the TAR and Gunji in the Pithoragarh District in the state of Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) of India. Border trade would take place during mutually agreed times each year. Lipulekh Pass (Qiang La) would facilitate visits by persons engaged in border trade and their exchange of commodities... Trade along Lipulekh has steadily increased from Rs. 0.4 million ($6,000) in 1992‚Äî93 to Rupees Rs. 6.9 million ($100,000) three years later.\\": \\"Though border trade along these routes is statistically insignificant, it makes a huge difference to the lives of people living in the Himalayan region... when I traversed Lipulekh Pass... I asked a villager... where the money for all this construction activity came from. He answered with a broad grin Tibet khul gaya (Tibet has been opened).\\"  Kalapani dispute (1998‚Äì2019)  Scholar Leo Rose states that Nepal virtually ignored the Kalapani issue from 1961 to 1997. In 1998, it became \\"convenient\\" to Nepal to raise a controversy about it for domestic political reasons. In September of that year, Nepal agreed with India that all border disputes, including Kalapani, would be resolved through bilateral talks. Nepal laid claim to all the areas east of the Lipu Gad/Kalapani River. The Nepalese contention was that the Lipu Gad was in fact the Kali River up to its source. They wanted the western border shifted 5.5 km westwards so as to include the Lipulekh Pass. Indian officials responded that the administrative records dating back to 1830s show that the Kalapani area had been administered as part of the Pithoragarh district (then a part of the Almora district). India also denied the Nepalese contention that Lipu Gad was the Kali River. In the Indian view, the Kali River begins only after Lipu Gad is joined by other streams arising from the Kalapani springs. Therefore, the Indian border leaves the midstream of river near Kalapani and follows the high watershed of the streams that join it. The 35 km2 of area between the Lipu Gad/Kalapani River and the watershed of the river is the disputed Kalapani territory. Despite several rounds of negotiations from 1998 to the present, the issue remains unresolved. In May 2020, India inaugurated a new link road to the Kailas-Manasarovar. Nepal objected to the exercise and said that it was violative of the prior understanding that boundary issues would be resolved through negotiation. India reaffirmed its commitment to negotiation but stated that the road follows the pre-existing route.Suhasini Haidar, New road to Kailash Mansarovar runs into diplomatic trouble, The Hindu, 9 May 2020.  Lympiadhura claims  The CPN-ML faction led by Bam Dev Gautam, which split off from CPN-UML in 1998, laid more expansive claims than the Nepalese government. Several Nepalese intellectuals drove these claims, chief among them being Buddhi Narayan Shrestha, the former Director General of the Land Survey Department. According to the intellectuals, the \\"Kali River\\" is in fact the Kuthi Yankti river that arises below the Limpiyadhura range. So they claim the entire area of Kumaon up to the Kuthi Valley, close to 400 km2 in total. Up to 2000, the Nepalese government did not subscribe to these expansive demands.: \\"Before claiming some area around the Kalapani tri-junction, Nepal had disputed even the source of the river Kali, as claimed by India.\\" In a statement to the Indian Parliament in 2000, the Indian foreign minister Jaswant Singh suggested that Nepal had questioned the source of the Kalapani river. But he denied that there was any dispute regarding the matter.: \\"I am clarifying there is no dispute regarding Kalapani. Hence it would not be correct to say there is a dispute regarding Kalapani between India and Nepal. Kalapani is a river and there are two opinions regarding its source.\\" On 20 May 2020, Nepal for the first time released a map that followed through with the more expansive claims, showing the entire area to the east of Kuthi Yankti river as part of their territory. On 13 June 2020, the bill seeking to give legal status to the new map was unanimously approved by the lower house in the Nepal Parliament.

As with the preceding two volumes of the Ars√®ne Lupin stories, this was first serialized in the French magazine Je sais tout from November 1908 to May 1909. The novel was released, with a few modifications, in June 1909. Plot summary The Needle of √âtretat Ars√®ne Lupin is opposed this time by Isidore Beautrelet, a young but gifted amateur detective, who is still in high school but who is poised to give Ars√®ne Lupin a big headache. In the Ars√®ne Lupin universe, the Hollow Needle is the second secret of Marie Antoinette and Alessandro Cagliostro, the hidden fortune of the kings of France, as revealed to Ars√®ne Lupin by Josephine Balsamo in the novel The Countess of Cagliostro (1924). The Mystery of the Hollow Needle hides a secret that the Kings of France have been handing down since the time of Julius Caesar... and now Ars√®ne Lupin has mastered it. The legendary needle contains the most fabulous treasure ever imagined, a collection of queens' dowries, pearls, rubies, sapphires and diamonds... the fortune of the kings of France. When Isidore Beautrelet discovers the Ch√¢teau de l'Aiguille in the department of Creuse, he thinks that he has found the solution to the riddle (\\"l'Aiguille Creuse\\" being French for \\"The Hollow Needle\\", and also the French title of the novel).

Sir William Henry Hornby, 1st Baronet, (29 August 1841 ‚Äì 22 October 1928), usually known as Harry Hornby, was an English industrialist and Conservative Party politician from Blackburn in Lancashire. He sat in the House of Commons from 1886 to 1910 but is notable for never speaking, or attempting to speak, in Parliament throughout his 24-year career there. Family and early life Hornby was the fourth son of William Henry Hornby, who had been Mayor of Blackburn and also served as Member of Parliament for the town; his younger brother was 'Monkey' Hornby, the Lancashire and England cricket captain. He had little interest himself in a political career but was proud of his family's record and noted the affection many in the local community felt for them. He was persuaded to enter politics as a member of the School Board when selected by the Church of England in 1871, and was subsequently voted chairman unanimously. In 1873 he was elected to the Town Council with a majority of one vote, prompting the Church to ring its bells. The year 1876 was 25th anniversary of Blackburn's incorporation and Hornby, as the son of the first Mayor, was persuaded to accept the office to mark the occasion. He resigned from the council in 1880 when his lack of electioneering was questioned. Parliament At the 1886 general election, Hornby was selected as the Conservative candidate without formality and with his confession that he had not wished to stand. Nevertheless, he was elected. Hornby was acutely aware that he was no good at making speeches, and was reluctant even to speak in Blackburn even though the townsfolk understood and accepted his difficulty. He was re-elected in subsequent general elections, winning more votes than his running-mate in the two-member constituency. In November 1896 Hornby wrote to the Conservative leader in Blackburn offering his resignation; as a result a delegation was organised to persuade him to change his mind. Some suspected that the fact that the other Blackburn MP William Coddington had recently been awarded a Baronetcy may have influenced Hornby's decision, and pressure was put on the Prime Minister to follow up. In the New Year's Honours list of 1899, Hornby was himself created a Baronet; flags were hung around the town's public buildings to mark the award.P. F. Clarke, \\"British Politics and Blackburn Politics, 1900‚Äì1910\\", Historical Journal, vol 12 no 2 (1969) pp. 304‚Äì5. In November 1901 Hornby was also elected Mayor of Blackburn for the following year. He was elected a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London (FZS) in July 1902. 1906 election During the split in the Unionists over Tariff Reform, Hornby was among the minority in being a strong supporter of Free Trade although he belonged to no Free Trade organisation.P. F. Clarke, \\"British Politics and Blackburn Politics, 1900‚Äì1910\\", Historical Journal, vol 12 no 2 (1969) pp. 311. For the first time at the 1906 general election, Hornby's record came under sustained criticism for the first time in his life. He responded by uncharacteristically making speeches vigorously defending himself; unfamiliar as he was, he took to offering large sums of money in challenges to rebut personal attacks on him. Against Hornby and another Conservative Free Trader stood the future Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden as a Labour candidate, and Edwin Hamer as a Liberal, running in effect a joint campaign. The election was very close but the fact that 822 voters used their two votes for Hornby and Snowden, while 624 voted for Hornby and Hamer, ensured that Hornby was again returned at the head of the poll. Snowden took the second seat.P. F. Clarke, \\"British Politics and Blackburn Politics, 1900‚Äì1910\\", Historical Journal, vol 12 no 2 (1969) pp. 312‚Äì3. Hornby definitely announced in 1908 that he would not stand again because he was becoming deaf, and felt depressed by life in the House of Commons where many of his old friends had lost their seats.P.

His great-grandfather was Robert Ramsay, who was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1870 to 1882. He studied at Geelong Grammar School, then obtained a Diploma in Farm Management from Glenormiston College. He worked as a jackaroo, then as manager of the East Mooleric Pastoral Company from 1974. He was president of the Victorian Farmers Federation from 2005 to 2009. In November 2009, Ramsay was preselected by the Liberal Party to as a candidate for the Western Victoria Region in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, after the retirement of John Vogels. He was elected at the 2010 state election. Earlier in the year, Ramsay had contested preselection for the federal seat of Corangamite, although he lost to Sarah Henderson. Ramsay and Henderson began a relationship shortly afterwards, but separated in 2017. In 2014, paramedics and firefighters protested at the opening of Ramsay's Ballarat office, after he made comments in the media that paramedics earned an average $93,500 a year. In July 2018, Ramsay was charged with drink driving when police recorded a blood alcohol reading of 0.191 per cent, which is nearly four times the legal limit in Victoria, after pulling his car over in Barwon Heads. Police pulled him over after his car was seen driving on the wrong side of the road. He resigned as an assistant shadow minister, and party leader Matthew Guy asked him to \\"consider his future in parliament\\".

The reservoir is shaped highly irregularly, with many deep bays, dotted with islands in its western section, and characterized by a large rounded peninsula in the centre. Primary tributaries are the Betsiamites, Sylvestre, Hirondelles, and Pipmuacan Rivers. The reservoir is named after Lake Pipmuacan that was flooded during the formation of the reservoir. The name is of Innu origin, that may mean \\"arrow\\". The Geographic Board reported in 1960 that \\"according to the missionaries of the C√¥te-Nord, the Innu had given this name to the lake in remembrance of their last fight with the Iroquois on Mount Pigmaugan (Pipmuacan) that overlooks the water.\\" Other spelling variations before standardization include Pipmuakan, Pipmaugan, and Pipmakan. The sport fish found in Pipmuacan Reservoir are northern pike, lake trout, brook trout, and lake whitefish. Outfitters provide fishing excursions and accommodations at the reservoir. History The Pipmuacan Reservoir was formed in October 1953 when Hydro-Qu√©bec began construction on the dams and power plant of Bersimis-1. The first dam, long and high, was built between two mountains surrounding Lake Cass√©, and the second, long, curtailed the release of water into the Desroches River. The reservoir's spillway was cut through a mountain between the two dams. By 1956, the construction work was completed.

Opened in 1937, it is the junction of the Fossano‚ÄìCuneo, Savigliano‚ÄìCuneo, Cuneo‚ÄìVentimiglia and Cuneo‚ÄìMondov√¨ railways. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. The other station in the city, Cuneo Gesso, forms part of the Cuneo‚ÄìMondov√¨ railway, and is not far from the hamlet of Borgo San Giuseppe (formerly Borgo Gesso). Location Cuneo railway station is situated in Piazzale della Libert√†, west of the city. History The station was opened on 7 November 1937 by the Communications Minister, Antonio Stefano Benni, together with the new Madonna Olmo‚ÄìPlateau Cuneo‚ÄìBorgo San Dalmazzo line, which replaced the old Cuneo Gesso‚ÄìBoves‚ÄìBorgo San Dalmazzo line. Features The station yard consists of five tracks for passengers (numbered from track 1 to track 6, track 2 being used for altering the composition of the trains), and eight other tracks for goods traffic. The locomotive depot is positioned to the south of the station yard and is connected to it by a double track line. Since 30 March 2009, the station has been equipped with a new public information system that communicates directly with the equipment used for the management of trains, ensuring timely and up to date information transfer. The station also now has new loudspeakers and monitors, which are operated using a modern information technology system. Passenger movements The station has about 3 million passenger movements each year. It is served by regional trains to Turin and Savona, both via Fossano, and, via Mondov√¨, to Saluzzo, Ventimiglia and Nice.

Evolution Shortly after the Gaza flotilla raid in the summer of 2010, a group of volunteers with shared experience of previous Viva Palestina land- based convoys to Gaza announced that they would be running a politically independent land convoy (as distinct from the inherently politicised nature of George Galloway's Viva Palestina, and from any further flotilla-like sea-based ventures). Their original stated intention was to coincide with an anticipated second Turkish-led attempt to enter Gaza by sea, thus seeing entry attempted by land and sea simultaneously. The project was conceived by former Viva Palestina volunteer Anwar Benny, and convoy leader on the road was aid worker Kieran Turner (of Aid Convoy). Other notable contributions were made by Gloucester to Gaza, the Waltham Forest branch of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, and Britain to Gaza of Bristol.Britain Gaza link meeting about Road to Hope Three days after the Road to Hope announcement, at a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Israeli embassy in London, George Galloway announced a new Viva Palestina land convoy, which became known as \\"Viva Palestina 5\\".Viva Palestina news The two projects became aware of each other and each decided that both could run in parallel. When the Turkish-led flotilla failed to happen, the two land convoys would still represent a simultaneous approach of multiple ventures to Gaza. Convoy The Road to Hope convoy departed the UK on 10 October 2010 (\\"10-10-10\\"), taking with it several volunteers from the Gaza flotilla raid - including seven survivors of the Mavi Marmara - plus other international solidarity organisations. It travelled via France, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, before falling victim to internal Libyan political issues together with what was claimed and reported to be the work of a confidence trickster who, they said, told them they would be granted passage through the Egyptian border (normally not possible under Egyptian compliance with the blockade of Gaza) because they would be travelling together with the official Libyan quasi government-run Al Quds 5 convoy ‚Äî which, as a government-backed enterprise, had exceptional permission to cross Egypt. As a result of the deceit and confusion, Road to Hope became stalled in Libya, where it remained into November 2010.Brighton and Hove Palestine Campaign local news: Road to Hope convoy to Gaza Strofades IV kidnapping incident On 11 November 2010, while boarding the M.V. Strofades IV, a ferry chartered to transport the convoy to Al Arish in Egypt, Road to Hope announced that ten members of the convoy, together with seven Libyan port officials, were kidnapped by the ship's owner, with the willing collaboration of its captain. After several days at sea they were eventually taken via Crete to Greece where Greek commandos raided the ship, resulting in their eventual release because they were found to have committed no crime (following investigations by the Greek police).Guardian newspaper 12 November 2010 \\"Gaza aid convoy Britons held on Greek captain's ship\\"CNN report 13 November 2010 \\"Gaza-bound ship in limbo in Greece\\"Liverpool Echo newspaper 13 November 2010 \\"British Aid worker Kieran Turner free after being taken hostage by Greek ship captain\\" The captain and owner of the ship were also arrested. Second ship Eventually, with help from a second bout of UK fundraising together with large donations from Libyan individuals, a second ship was secured. This transported the vehicles and a monitoring delegation of three convoy members, while the other convoy members chartered a flight to Al Arish in Egypt. The convoy reached Rafah and crossed into Gaza on 26 November 2010. Three of the kidnapped members had been able to rejoin by that point. A total of twelve convoy members were denied access to Egypt (and thus through passage to Gaza) for no stated reason ‚Äî as has happened to previous Viva Palestina convoy members.Road to Hope: Mission accomplished References External links * Road to Hope website / convoy log Cross-border operations Non-profit organisations based in the United Kingdom Non- governmental organizations involved in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Organizations established in 2010 ","title":"Road to Hope"},{"id":"30049455","text":"Maxime Decelles (30 April 1849 - 7 July 1905) was a Canadian Roman Catholic bishop.

It is operational and manned by volunteers. History The first mill on this site was built in 1847 but stood only a few years before new owner Jan Pieters Duinkerk had it replaced by a larger mill which was finished in 1854 and operated by his son Pieter Jans Duinkerk. The new mill changed hands several times, the successive owners were Auke Jacobs Bakker, Dirk Jans van der Wal and Jan Johannes van der Leij. Van der Leij's son Johannes Jans inherited the mill and kept milling until the smock was demolished in 1922. The base was left standing and survived for over half a century as storage space. In 1976 the municipally Leeuwarderadeel bought the base and had the mill rebuilt by millwright Tacoma from Stiens. By 1979 the mill was back in full working order. A company \\"Molen De Hoop BV\\" was formed with local baker J. Bijlsma as the driving force behind the commercial operation of the mill. Miller was G.J. Klijnstra, later accompanied by S. Kuipers. In the early morning on New Year's Day 1992 a fireworks rocket set fire to the thatched smock, resulting in the destruction of mill. The insurance companies and the municipally all quickly agreed on rebuilding the mill which meant the new mill was completed in less than 16 months after the fire. The rebuild had the added bonus of having the opportunity to redesign and modernise the mill resulting in among others a state of the art computer-controlled production line. At the reopening on 23 April 1993 J. Bijlsma called the mill \\"the most modern corn mill in the world\\". The total construction cost exceeded ∆í2 million of which ∆í26.000 was raised by the local population. Unfortunately, despite the speedy reconstruction and modernization, customers had turned to other suppliers such as De Zwaluw, Burdaard and demand for traditionally ground flour was found too low to keep the mill profitable. In 1997 the mill stopped milling commercially. After a few years of standstill the mill is now run by volunteers on a weekly basis. It is also a training mill for the Frisian Millers Guild. Description De Hoop is what the Dutch describe as a \\"stellingmolen\\" . It is a three-storey smock mill on a three-storey base. The stage is at third-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch with a continuous chain. The cap rotates on 24 wooden blocks. The sails on the outer sailstock are Common sails, with leading edges streamlined on the Fok system. The sails on the inner sailstock are Ten Have sails, with leading edges fitted with aerofoils on the Van Bussel system. Both have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by IJzergieterij Hardinxveld- Giessendam as number 47. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 65 cogs.

At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 87 cogs, drives the two lantern pinion stone nuts, which have 27 and 28 staves. These drive the and diameter millstones. A third pair of stones is driven by an electric motor so production could continue on days when there was not enough wind. Several modern developments were added during the 1992 rebuild. A chain elevator lifted grain from the ground floor to the grain silos on the third floor (first floor in the smock) from where it could be fed by gravity to one of the pairs of millstones. The grain flow to the silos and from silo to millstone was computer controlled by pneumatically operated valves. Also a central dust extraction system was added. Flour was collected on the first floor in a large silo and mixer from where it could be bagged on the ground floor. Unfortunately following years of standstill and disuse these systems are no longer functional. The ground floor also houses a small shop selling flour and bread making products.

Not long after being recognized as tulku, he was enthroned at Drong Gon Tubten Dargye Ling, in Nakchukha, north of the capital city Lhasa. Ch√∂kyi Nyima and his family fled Tibet due to the Chinese invasion. He and his younger brother, Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, soon enrolled at the Young Lamas Home School in Dalhousie, India. At age thirteen, he entered Rumtek Monastery and spent 11 years studying under the care of the 16th Gyalwang Karmapa. In his youth he studied the Karma Kagyu, Drikung Kagyu, and Nyingma traditions. He also studied under Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, Khunu Lama Tenzin Gyaltsen, and his father, Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche. Ch√∂kyi Nyima Rinpoche left Rumtek in 1974. Upon completion of the monastery in 1976, the Karmapa enthroned Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche as the abbott of Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling Monastery in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Welfare is considered a type of social protection, which may come in the form of remittances, such as 'welfare checks', or subsidized services, such as free/reduced healthcare, affordable housing, and more. Pierson (2006) has acknowledged that, like poverty, welfare creates behavioral ramifications, and that studies differ regarding whether welfare empowers individuals or breeds dependence on government aid. Pierson also acknowledges that the evidence of the behavioral effects of welfare varies across countries (such as Norway, France, Denmark, and Germany), because different countries implement different systems of welfare. United States In the United States, the debate over the impact of welfare traces back as far as the New Deal, but it later became a more mainstream political controversy with the birth of modern welfare under President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. The term \\"welfare culture,\\" however, was not coined until 1986, by Lawrence Mead. Welfare in the United States Decline in welfare benefits since 1962. (in 2006 dollars) 2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence Figure TANF 2. Welfare may refer to any government-based aid used to promote the well-being of its citizens. In recent decades, however, welfare has been restricted to refer to the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program (TANF), which provides monthly stipends for indigent families that meet a specific array of criteria. The term \\"welfare culture\\" uses the more broad interpretation of welfare, all government social programs. However, scholars like David Ellwood and Lawrence Summers (1985) believe that the debate over welfare culture could be more accurate if each specific welfare program were examined individually. Specific programs include Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment benefits, and disability benefits. Evolution of the debate in the United States Kent R. Weaver argues that most scholars cite the Social Security Act of 1935 as the origin of the American welfare state. That reform enacted a wide expanse of services for the poor and financially stressed, including unemployment benefits, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (later replaced in by the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program under the Clinton administration), retirement income stipends, subsidized housing, and many others.\\"Social Security Act of 1935. United States Statutes at Large. Scholars such as June Axinn and Mark J. Stern (2007) estimate that the Social Security Act of 1935 and the newly institutionalized programs accompanying the New Deal increased the capacity to find employment, avoid starvation, and secure some form of affordable housing. Furthermore, economist Robert Cohen (1973) estimated that the New Deal sparked a reduction in unemployment from 20% to 15% by the end of the 1940s. Stanley Feldman and John Zaller (1992) cite a number of economists and political historians who opposed government-based aid, because such critics credit the economic stimulus during World War II as the true solution to the unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression. During the war, American industries began to produce military weapons, food, and other material needs for the troops. The new economic incentive, in addition to a net export and an influx in gold, reduced interest rates, increased investments, and sparked job growth. Christine Romber (1992) and various other economic historians began to criticize the New Deal as the cause for unnecessary and unjustified reliance on government programs. However, Jerold Rusk (2008), a political scientist, recognizes a consensus among economic, history, and political scholars, which acknowledges that the effects of the New Deal are difficult to separate from the effects of World War II, which prevents any legitimate conclusion from being drawn on the debate.Jerold Rusk. Interview (2008). In the early 1960s, President Johnson began his War on Poverty by introducing many new elements to welfare, including Medicare, Medicaid, increases in subsidized public housing, and more. David Frum (2002) believed such increases in government programs were counterproductive and found positive correlations between government aid and those who could not stay above the poverty line without such aid. Frum concluded that welfare bred dependence on the government. During the Johnson administration, a sociologist, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, published a study on the impacts of welfare on behavior during the 1960s. His report, The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (1965), is commonly referred to as the \\"Moynihan Report.\\" The Moynihan Report advocates for increased welfare for poor black families but that welfare does not empower the destitute to find solutions to their financial troubles. Moynihan stated, \\"The breakdown of the negro family has led to a startling increase in welfare dependency.\\" Welfare, although helpful, was a reactive measure failing to address the true roots of poverty. Moynihan concluded that more proactive means to empower black families include the promotion of vocational training and a value in education. Johnson's precedent for increasing welfare benefits hit its pinnacle in the late 1970s under President Jimmy Carter when Temporary Assistance to Needy Family (TANF) recipients were receiving $238 a month, adjusted for inflation. According to the Census Bureau, a strong correlation with poverty reduction is noted, suggesting a link between welfare and empowerment. Poverty dropped from 23% of the population to 12% during the Johnson years. Poverty did not see an increase again until 1982 with 15% of Americans facing poverty, two years after welfare programs experienced serious cuts under President Ronald Reagan. However, the findings are not without their criticisms. According to the US Census Bureau, poverty had already begun to decrease before Johnson passed the Equal Opportunity Act. Additionally, unemployment reached some of its lowest rates in history under President Dwight Eisenhower near the end of the 1950s. Before Eisenhower left office, unemployment was estimated to be less than 5%. In 1986, Lawrence Mead introduced a series of studies on welfare culture. Mead compared changes in income levels and welfare benefits across urban dwellers from the 1960s through the 1980s. Mead's studies suggest that over half of all welfare recipients will not need to stay on welfare for more than 10 years, but only 12% will be off welfare in less than 3 years. Mead concludes that welfare has demonstrated some proven effects for helping impoverished families meet their basic needs and find employment, thus acting as a tool for empowerment. However, Mead acknowledges that the welfare system can do better. Mead believes welfare culture could breed empowerment more effectively if mandatory participation in education/job training programs were required for welfare recipients. Evidence of behavioral effects Anthropologist Oscar Lewis studied the behavioral effects of poverty on indigent Mexicans. He introduced the concept of the \\"culture of poverty\\" and 70 personality traits that he saw in the mentality of the impoverished, including helplessness, disdain for the government, lack of confidence, hopelessness, and a sense of futility that accompanies the search for employment.

It has a mostly tropical or subtropical distribution worldwide, but some species occur as far north as Moscow region in Russia and the Yukon Territory in Canada. This genus is relictual, having had a pantropical distribution during the Cretaceous. The presence of Leptoconops, along with Austroconops, in ancient Lebanese amber makes these the earliest existing lineages of biting midges. Extinct species have also been described from amber from Siberia, New Jersey, Canada, Hungary, Sakhalin, France, and Spain. Adult Leptoconops females are diurnal feeders, and suck vertebrate blood. Adults of both sexes in some species rest by burying themselves in sand. Larvae feed on algae, fungi, and bacteria. They burrow in moist, usually saline, sand or mud of desert areas and coastal and inland beaches.

program for hardware-non-specific explanation of the general functioning and behaviour of a virtual processor, running on the Microsoft Windows operating system. Devices like miniaturized calculators, microcontroller, microprocessors, and computer can be explained on custom-developed instruction code on a register transfer level controlled by sequences of micro instructions (microcode). Based on this it is possible to develop an instruction set to control a virtual application board at higher level of abstraction.  General  Initially MikroSim was developed to be a processor simulation software to be widely available in educational areas. Since MikroSim operability starts on the basis of microcode development, defined as a sequence of micro instructions (microcoding) for a virtual control unit, the software's intention is on first approach a microcode simulator with various levels of abstractions including the ability of CPU simulators and instruction set emulators. In the current software revision it is feasible for a microcode controlled virtual application to operate on own coded instruction sets. With MikroSim typical and well-known concepts in the area of computer engineering like computer architecture and instruction set architecture are non-specifically treated, which have been established since the early days of the information era and being still valid. In this fashion the simulation software gains a timeless, free didactical benefit without being restricted on special developments of the past and in the future. The detailed documentation and the bilingual application's graphical user interface (GUI) in German and English, as well as the software's upward compatibility given to some extent by Microsoft's operating system Windows, are reasons for being a well-established, valuable e-learning tool in the field of computer engineering since 1992 for educational use.  History of development  The software is based on a version written under Turbo Pascal compiled for MS-DOS operating systems which has been used for educational purposes in computer engineering and computer science at the Philipps- University Marburg (Germany) until 1992. The concept was picked up by Martin Perner during his study of physics (1990‚Äì95) in summer 1992, revised, and converted into a windows application compiled with Microsoft Visual Basic and running on Windows 3.1x. In doing so, at this time a simulator with huge conceptual improvements arose by exploiting the novel functionality and utilisation of MS Windows‚Äô GUI for supporting the composition of microcode and the traceability of its instructional influence. The enhancements of the e-learning tool under Windows has been supported and promoted by the Fachbereich Mathematik/Informatik of the University of Marburg by Heinz-Peter Gumm until end 1995. The Simulator has been awarded with the ‚Äò‚ÄôEuropean Academic Software Award 1994‚Äô‚Äô in the computer science category in Heidelberg (Germany) in November 1994. In March 1995 the simulator was presented at the computer exhibition CeBIT‚Äô95 in Hannover at the exhibit of the ‚Äò‚ÄôHessischen Hochschulen‚Äô‚Äô. Between 1995 and 2000 the simulator was published as ‚Äò‚ÄôMikrocodesimulator MikroSim 1.2‚Äô‚Äô without any significant improvements. At this time the tool received an award of 1000 ECU from the European Union in conjunction with the ‚Äò‚ÄôEuropean Year of Livelong Learning 1996‚Äô‚Äô. In 1997, the software was presented at the contest ‚Äò‚ÄôMultimedia Transfer‚Äô97‚Äô‚Äô in connection to the exhibition ‚Äò‚ÄôLearnTec‚Äô97‚Äô‚Äô.. In its penultimate revision, the simulator has been published under ‚Äò‚ÄôMikrocodesimulator MikroSim2000‚Äô‚Äô, optimized for MS Windows 95‚Äôs 32-bit operation. Between 2008 and 2009, the simulator concept has been revised, reworked, and thoughtful extended. So it has received wide ranging improvements and extensions without touching the successful conceptual aspects of the microcode simulation abilities in the core. For this purpose, advantage is taken of today‚Äôs computing system‚Äôs performance determined by operating system and underlying computational power to extend MikroSim‚Äôs simulation possibilities up to the stage of a virtual application board. MikroSim is compiled and optimized for sake of unrestricted compatibility and for widest distribution possible for MS Windows XP as a 32-bit version. The program runs on all 32- and 64-bit operating systems of MS Windows Vista and MS Windows 7. Thereby, no special XP compatibility mode is needed. Since January 2010, the simulator is distributed as ‚Äò‚ÄôMikrocodesimulator MikroSim 2010‚Äô‚Äô by 0/1-SimWare.  Functionality  The windows application allows for the gradual establishment of a virtual application that is predetermined and such unchangeable in its functionality. In exploration mode, the operating principle and control of newly added components influenced by one microcode instruction within a cycle can be evaluated. The width of MikroSim‚Äôs micro instructions is 49 bits. A single micro instruction is executed in three phases of a 3-phase clock. The partial phases are referred to as ‚ÄúGET‚Äù, ‚ÄúCALCULATE‚Äù and ‚ÄúPUT‚Äù phase, causing to fetch some register value, to execute a 32-bit calculation, and to store the calculation result into a CPU's internal register, finally. In simulation mode, seamlessly executed micro instructions control the central processing unit of the simulator in subsequent cycles. Therefore, the intrinsic ability of one micro instruction is utilized to address the next micro instruction in the control store. The control store holding the micro instruction set (commonly referred as \\"microcode\\") comprises 1024 micro instructions words each 49-bit wide. Using structuring opportunities of the control store for addressable scheduling of the microcode and the implementation of a cyclically operating machine code interpreter, that is programmed in microcode as well allows the implementation of individual micro-operation sequences, known as machine instructions. The microcode can be regarded as firmware for MikroSim, that can be modified, and stored in and reloaded from a microcode-ROM-file. Within a micro instruction execution cycle, the CPU as well as an input / output controller is connected to an external 16 kByte huge random access memory device (RAM). Via the input- output controller device, communication with virtual input and output devices is supported by Direct Memory Access mode (DMA), Inter-Integrated Circuit Connection (I2C), and Interrupt request functionality (IRQ). A output port, a display, a timer, an event trigger, a digital-analog converter, a keyboard and data input / output channel is provided as virtual IC device for explaining didactically the communication with external devices. The microcode simulator uses eight freely usable register each 32-bit wide connected with a 32-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The register content can be regarded as signed or unsigned integer values, or as 32-bit floating point numbers. The register content can be easily viewed, interpreted, and modified bitwise an integrated system number editor. The 32-bit ALU is the key unit of the central processing unit. It supports 128 different basic arithmetic operations for integer operation, interrupt control, and for floating point arithmetic. The didactical approach to floating point calculations, which has been introduced in a comparable manner already in the early 1940s by Konrad Zuse, is introduced by using elemental sublevel operations for exponent and mantissa involved in the key operations of addition/subtraction and multiplication/division. A set of powerful 32-bit floating point arithmetic commands in mantissa and exponent for the basic operations and elementary analytical functions are provided, as they are realized in today's mathematical coprocessors. Here, in the simulation with MikroSim it is ideally assumed that the execution of each supported ALU arithmetic operation requires only a distinct computing duration independent of circuit complexity realistically needed in practice. The execution of micro instructions can be operated on various simulation levels with different temporal resolution: * In the lowest simulation level, the simulator supports the phased wise execution of GET, CALCULATE, and PUT phase. The processing of the partial phases is possible with an adjustable delay for better traceability. * In next upper level, the current micro instruction is executed in a complete three-phase clock without time delay. A continuous execution of several 3-phase clock cycles is supported within a so-called ‚ÄúLoad Increment Execute‚Äù (LIE) cycle. The LIE cycle regarded as an interpreter written in microcode has the function to load machine instructions coded as byte value from the external RAM and to let branch the micro instruction sequence to the referenced microcode subroutine for execution given by the opcode and returning to the LIE back to retrieve the next machine instruction. * One execution level higher, a sequence of several machine instructions are executable until a user-defined break point is reached, which is placed in the machine code sequence. It is possible to measure run times between break points. So it is possible to benchmark execution performance on machine and microcode level. * In the top most simulation level the microcode simulator continuously executes micro instructions without interrupt. In this level, machine instruction by machine instruction is loaded. So, it is possible to focus on the interaction of the CPU with external devices. With various additional options, visual CPU activities can be suppressed for the benefit of increasing the processing speed when the control of the application by machine programming is put forward. The performance index monitor provided with the simulator enables the user to benchmark the processing performance of MikroSim and setting it into relation with computing power of the simulator's hardware, measurable in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) and instructions per second (IPS). With the so-called ‚Äô‚ÄôBasic Assembler Tool for MikroSim‚Äô‚Äô MikroBAT, simple programs can be developed in assembler programming language. Here, all supported mnemonics of the assembler programming language are determined by the user's self-created machine's instruction set on micro instruction level. The add-on tool is able to translate the assembly language program into machine code and data and transferring the binary code into the external RAM for subsequent simulations. Together with MikroBAT the microcode simulator MikroSim supports the didactical introduction of teaching aspects in technical computer science from a switch-controlled calculating machine to an assembler programmable application.

Mills had previously represented District 46 in the Louisiana House of Representatives. Early life and education Mills holds a degree in pharmacy from the University of Louisiana at Monroe. He is the owner in St. Martin Parish of Mills Cashway Pharmacy in Parks and the president and chief executive officer of Farmers-Merchants Bank and Trust Co. of Breaux Bridge. Farmers-Merchants, originally established in 1932, also has a branch at 1525 Ambassador Caffery Parkway in Lafayette. Career In the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, 2007, the incumbent Democratic representative, Sydnie Mae Maraist Durand, did not seek reelection. In a two-candidate field, Mills, then a Democrat himself, won outright by a wide margin over a fellow Democrat, Marie Etienne of St. Martin Parish, 12,034 (84 percent) to 2,237 (16 percent). In 2008 and 2009, Mills received a 100 percent rating from the Louisiana Right-to-Life Federation. He has been rated 69 percent by the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. The Louisiana Family Forum in 2009 rated him at 89 percent. Mills guided to passage in 2010 legislation to permit pharmacists to administer medication therapy management services to patients in Louisiana. The interest group, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, supported the legislation. The bill was signed on June 25, 2010, by then Governor Bobby Jindal. The measure authorizes the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals to create an MTM pharmacy program. NACDS president Steven C. Anderson said that the Louisiana measure \\"illustrates that pharmacist-administered medication therapy management is an important component in helping patients stay healthy and in reducing health-care costs. Pharmacists are uniquely qualified to offer health screenings and counsel patients about how to take their medications in the right ways to achieve better results. The law will also enable pharmacists to assist patients in managing chronic diseases, such as diabetes.\\" In 2010, Mills joined several legislative colleagues in switching allegiance from the Democrats to the Republicans. Others who made the switch in December 2010 are Representative Noble Ellington of Winnsboro in Franklin Parish and State Senators John Alario of Westwego in Jefferson Parish and John R. Smith of Leesville in Vernon Parish. Mills polled 12,812 votes in the special Senate election, or 60 percent of the total. The runner-up was Simone B. Champagne of Jeanerette, another recent Republican convert and a state representative from Iberia Parish, who received 4,040 votes (19 percent). Champagne campaigned as a \\"Reagan Republican\\" and had the open support of U.S. Senator David Vitter; she returned the favor by endorsing Vitter for governor in 2015. Independent David Groner finished third with 2,534 votes (12 percent). The remaining ballots favored two other Republican candidates and a second Independent hopeful. No Democrats ran for the position. Two Republicans ran in an April 2, 2011, special election to fill the nine months remaining in Mills' House term. St. Martin Parish councilman Mike \\"Pete\\" Huval defeated St. Martinville city councilman Craig Prosper, 58 to 42 percent. Mills held the title of \\"newest Louisiana state senator\\" for only a month. Jonathan W. Perry of Kaplan in Vermilion Parish, winner of a special election in District 26 on February 19, 2011, soon filled that billing, and oddly, he too is known for his humor, often appearing as a stand-up Cajun comic. He is closely allied with his lifelong friend Scott Angelle, a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2015.  Senate Health and Welfare Committee  In January 2016, Senate President John Alario appointed Mills chairman of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee. As the chairman of the health committee, Mills oversees the state's $12 billion Medicaid program. In 2018, Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera said that the potential exists for fraud involving hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicaid funds. \\"Let's understand our risks and exposure and what we can do to mitigate it,\\" Mills told his committee. Purpera earlier said that Medicaid had been \\"run kind of willy-nilly, loosey-goosey‚Äù by the Louisiana Department of Health. Purpera's warning was echoed by U.S. Senator John N. Kennedy and state Attorney General Jeff Landry as well as some state legislators. In a press release, Senator Kennedy said that the public will \\"happily pay for your doctor if you are too poor to be sick. I‚Äôm proud of that. But I‚Äôm neither happy about nor proud of the Medicaid fraud tolerated\\" by the Department of Health. The audits do not specify any specific fraud but mention a \\"risk group.\\"  Personal life  Mills previously served on the St. Martin Parish Council. He and his wife, Deborah K. Mills, reside in St. Martinville but have business interests throughout the parish. He is Roman Catholic.

He was born in Stamford, Connecticut. He was a tory sympathiser during the American Revolutionary War and was mistreated by the rebels, so decided to leave the United States. In 1784, he moved to what would become the new province of New Brunswick and finally settled in Woodstock, New Brunswick in 1788. Educator In 1787 he was sent to Woodstock Parish by the Company for Propagation of the Gospel in New England and the parts adjacent in America Not the same organisation as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts founded in 1701. (commonly called the New England Company) to run a school for the Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) Indians. This school was one of a number established by the company, whose aim was to convert the Indians from Roman Catholicism and to teach them both the English language and a trade. His efforts met with moderate success. By 1790 he had built a log schoolhouse 26 feet by 22 feet and on 4 January of that year he had 22 students, adults as well as children. \\"They are Constant in their Attendance,\\" he wrote, \\"and exceeding quick in receiving Instruction, five of them in Particular are amazing so, having made great Improvement both in Spelling and Writing.\\" He made some progress in the Indians‚Äô language, though reportedly hindered by \\"a necessary attention to his Farm, in order to subsist his family.\\" Two years later, however, the New England Company decided to centralize its efforts elsewhere, so his schools were closed. Dibblee‚Äôs interest in education remained. In his letters to the Company he frequently requested aid for schools and schoolmasters and asked that books be sent out to them. By 1822 there were in his large district ten of the Madras schools, or National schools, promoted by Lieutenant Governor George Stracey Smyth; they averaged about 40 students each. Cleric In 1791, Frederick Dibblee travelled to Halifax to be ordained a deacon, and the next year, he was raised to the priesthood in Saint John. He was given the four large parishes of Prince William, Queensbury, Northampton, and Woodstock, where he lived. He also visited the military settlements north of Woodstock, the first clergyman, he said, to do so. Diarist Frederick Dibblee kept diaries from 1803 to his death in 1826, which survived, and are stored in the archives of the New Brunswick Museum in Saint John. They give a rich commentary on the agricultural and social conditions of the central Saint John River valley during the loyalist era. They include an account of the weather conditions of 1816, and the effect it had on farms and crops on the area. This was the year known as the year without a summer which caused major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere  References  1753 births 1826 deaths 18th-century Church of England clergy 19th-century Church of England clergy 18th-century Anglican priests 19th- century Anglican priests Canadian Anglican priests ","title":"Frederick Dibblee"},{"id":"30050106","text":"Rops may refer to: People * Daniel-Rops (1901‚Äì1965), French writer and historian * F√©licien Rops (1833‚Äì1898), Belgian artist Places * Rops (peak), a mountain in Kosovo Sports * Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS), a Finnish football club Technology * Rollover protection structure, a system or structure intended to protect equipment operators and motorists from injuries caused by vehicle overturns or rollovers * Runway Overrun Prevention System, a technology used in the Airbus A350 XWB * Render output unit (or raster operations pipeline, ROP), a feature of graphics cards See also * ROP (disambiguation) * Rop (name) ","title":"Rops"},{"id":"30050110","text":"Eleftherios Fotiadis (; born 15 July 1965) is a former professional Greek footballer.

Timber can be infested in one location and then be transported large distances by ship, after which the beetles can emerge and spread the infestation to new areas.University of Florida Lyctus planicollis LeConte, 1859 is considered a synonym of the species of Lyctus carbonarius. Description The adult beetle ranges from four to six millimetres in length and is a dark brownish-black. The head is prominent and is not covered by the pronotum. The antennae have eleven segments, the end two being broadened giving a club-like effect. The body is elongated and slightly flattened with the pronotum wider than it is long. The elytra are ridged longitudinally, with double rows of small puncture marks between the ridges. The body is covered by a sparse, short yellowish down.Forestry images Life cycle A female laying eggs. Normally the ovipositor would deposit eggs inside the wood. The female beetle mates soon after emerging in the spring and lays up to fifty eggs over the course of a week. The eggs are white, cylindrical and about one millimetre long. They are laid deep inside holes in wood, either in the tunnels made by emerging adults or in pores, cracks and crevices. The eggs hatch in one to three weeks depending on the temperature. The larvae are cream-coloured and grow to about seven millimetres long as they tunnel deeper into the wood, leaving behind them the powderlike frass of wood debris that gives them their common name. They feed on the starchy content of the wood as they are unable to digest cellulose. Young larvae chew their way along the grain of sapwood but older larvae may tunnel across the grain. They may come near to the surface but do not break through. When the larvae are ready to pupate, they build pupal chambers close to the surface. Metamorphosis takes from twelve days to a month. The adults break out of the pupae and chew their way to the surface leaving behind circular holes. The little wisps of sawdust that fall from these may be the first sign of an infestation. The adult beetles are nocturnal and may live for up to three months. The whole life cycle takes about a year but can vary from six months to four years. In heated buildings development occurs quickly but in adverse environments, growth is slower and the larvae may hibernate in colder regions. This is the main reason for the variability in the length of the life cycle. Damage The larval stage is responsible for nearly all the damage done by the beetle. They feed on many of the various hardwoods used in wood paneling, door and window frames, furniture, baskets, hardwood trim and flooring in homes. Only sapwood is attacked.Forest and Timber Insects in New Zealand No. 33 Infestation usually occurs prior to construction of the article. Varnished, painted or polished surfaces are not normally susceptible to attack but the female beetle may still lay her eggs in empty tunnels created by previous beetle occupants. Subfloors, joists and rafters are usually made of pine or other softwood and generally escape infestation. Imported tropical hardwoods may be heavily infested because of poor drying and storage practices before shipment.

The company's roots were with its mobile Internet device, a low-cost email-only mobile handheld device launched in September 2008. __TOC__  Company  Peek was founded in 2007 by three of the first four employees at Virgin Mobile USA - Rob Gray (Virgin's first head of product marketing), CEO Dr. Amol Sarva (Virgin's first head of non-voice applications and its finance director), and John Tantum (its first employee and first President). The company had offices in New York, NY, New Delhi, India, Nanjing, China and staff in Arizona, California, and Toronto.  Peek software and cloud  Peek's product is a family of applications for mobile devices that major device producers license and pre-install. These applications include push email, IM and chat, social networking apps, synchronization and backup, and other mobile features. These apps are tailored to the lower-cost and simpler hardware that dominates the global phone market, and relies on the Peek cloud architecture to offload computing and storage from the phone to the cloud. History In September 2008, the original Peek email device launched in the United States. On September 12, 2008, Peek received its first review in a major outlet when David Pogue called it \\"sweet\\", \\"simple\\", \\"elegant\\" and predicted that Peek's model would win \\"quiet, gradual popular acceptance by normal people\\". In April 2009, Peek launched their second device, the Peek Pronto, which supports Push email ('instant' delivery), Microsoft Exchange, increased support for email attachments (PDFs, DOC and pictures), and unlimited texting support. TwitterPeek, introduced in November 2009, is a mobile device that allows users to send and receive tweets using Twitter. It is the first Twitter-only mobile device. It went on sale on November 3, 2009. In 2010, Peek refreshed its lineup with Peek 9 - adding Facebook, Twitter and other social and news features. In 2011, the first 3rd party handsets launched from fast-growing producers such as MicroMax in India. The Peek software brings smartphone features to these low-cost handhelds. In 2012, Peek announced that it was going to end support for the Peek device and instead shift their attention to the cloud.  Technology  The 2008 Peek device was designed by Peek in partnership with IDEO and BYD, and its architecture is based on the Texas Instruments Locosto chipset with an ARM core. It uses a customized, lightweight operating system nicknamed \\"Peekux\\" which is based on Nucleus RTOS by Mentor Graphics. The Peek device's client firmware is C/C++ code written for the TI environment. Flavors of the Peek application for alternative operating environments from other RTOSes, to BREW, to Windows, to Android have all been spotted. The core of Peek's real time mobile messaging platform is a cloud application. The environment is a conventional web application LAMP stack and relies in part on Amazon Web Services. This cloud application has been deployed on many partner company devices since 2010.  Reception  When Peek's first device launched, Time selected Peek as one of the 50 Best Inventions of the Year 2008. It was voted on Time.com as the #1 entry in the Gadget of the Year review. Elizabeth Woyke of Forbes wrote, \\"at a time when the economy is melting and one-time bankers are on the street [Peek] is betting customers will embrace the no-fuss simplicity - not to mention the modest price - of the Peek.\\", myitplanet.de Tony Long, a journalist of Gadget Lab from Wired.com reviewed Peek as a device that \\"delivers peak email performance\\" and that using the device was \\"a breeze... even without operating instructions\\". He recommended the Peek device to those who would like access to their \\"e-mail from time to time, or if [they] believe that simplicity in all things is the key to life\\". Wired Magazine's December 2008 issue named Peek their #1 Gadget on their \\"Gear of the Year\\" review: \\"Not every gadget needs a carnival of features. Take the Peek, which tackles just a single task: mobile email. No phone, no browser, no camera‚Äîand no apologies. It won't satisfy convergence-rabid smartphone fetishists, but for the rest of the world (i.e., the majority of it), this one-trick pony is a godsend. In terms of looks, its slim profile stands up to the big boys. But the real treat is the interface.\\" After the Peek Pronto launch, International Design Magazine featured Peek Pronto on the cover of its 2009‚Äîand final‚ÄîAnnual Design Review. TwitterPeek, on the other hand, met broad skepticism in the press. CNN.com 2009 Year in Review listed it as one of the top 10 biggest technology failures of 2009. Gizmodo went as far as to name TwitterPeek as one of the \\"50 Worst Gadgets of the Decade.\\" In 2010, Peek 9's enhanced features were met by Engadget's reviewers as \\"dancing with a full list of features\\" and \\"Peek 9 is nine times faster than Pronto, adds PeekMaps, weather, Twitter, and Facebook\\". TechCrunch's gadget reviewers said Peek 9 \\"brings a whole new level of cool to the not-a-smartphone device. It seems nearly everything is updated from the mail service to the hardware. It‚Äôs a mighty big update for Peek, but somehow all this goodness rings up for less than the previous generation ‚Äî even the service plan is cheaper now.\\" On October 14, 2010, older Peek devices were disconnected from the network and Peek offered all its users a free, new replacement Peek 9 device to continue their service. In 2011, Peek expanded their push email technology globally and now part of their \\"Genius Cloud\\" platform for low-cost featurephones. On January 24, 2012, GSMA nominates Peek for the best cloud technology. On January 30, 2012, Peek users reported their devices abruptly stopped working, despite having paid $299 for \\"lifelong service\\". On February 1, 2012, Peek announced that it had terminated service for all its dedicated hardware in a move to cloud-only service. Peek's CEO, Amol Sarva stated that the abandoned products were \\"seriously old\\" and have reached their end of life, with only a \\"handful of users\\" left in the US. \\"Unfortunately we cannot maintain the network forever for a few users, so that end time has come. The networks are changing standards, protocols etc and the old units are now end of life. We have lots going with rapid adoption of our software by phone brands around the world, so Peek is flat out building for a number of platforms that our OEM customers are deploying like Android and Mediatek. We are not offering a Peek-made device to replace these old ones.\\" \\"Peek isn't in the hardware business anymore. Since last year, the company has been selling \\"the genius cloud,\\" a series of services designed to make inexpensive feature phones smarter. Sarva notes that his product has just been nominated for the GSMA's Best Technology award which will be handed out at MWC later this month.

Her pop punk/power pop vocal style helped to define the band's sound and she has co-written their minor hit singles \\"Slowly, Slowly\\" and \\"Open the Door\\". Prior to the formation of Magnapop, Hopper was a member of the Athens, Georgia music scene in the early 1980s, which included R.E.M., The B-52s, and her own band Oh-OK. History Hopper performing the Magnapop song \\"Favorite Writer\\" with R.E.M. in 2003 Hopper is a native of Marietta, Georgia who moved to Athens to attend the University of Georgia to study art in the late 1970s. There, she befriended Michael Stipe in an art design class and she introduced him to her friends. The two became involved in the early local music scene and formed the short-lived experimental music group Tanzplagen along with Stipe's sister Lynda and other local musicians. After a matter of months, the band split up and Michael Stipe formed R.E.M., while Hopper made Oh-OK with Lynda Stipe on bass guitar and drummer David McNair (a later line- up would also include Matthew Sweet.) Oh-OK opened for Stipe's noise music project 1066 Gaggle O'Sound and would go on to record two mini albums before disbanding in 1984, including 1983's Furthermore What, which was produced by Michael Stipe with a cover that he made. She then briefly belonged to a band named Holiday, who released their only EP in 1987. In 1989, Hopper was introduced to Ruthie Morris‚Äîa guitarist who had recently moved from West Palm Beach, Florida to East Atlanta. The two became friends and began writing songs together, forming the core of what would become Magnapop. Michael Stipe saw their first public performance and offered to produce some demos for them in John Keane's Athens studio in December 1990. Their first high-profile show was at the July 1991 New York New Music Seminar along with three other bands that were introduced by Stipe. Their 1992 self-titled first album included four of the 1990 Stipe demos and was released on Caroline Records in the United States. The band established a following touring through Benelux in the 1990s and had two minor hit singles, but after the 1996 release of Rubbing Doesn't Help, Magnapop found themselves dropped by their record label and unable to record for seven years due to contractual obligations. Hopper and Morris continued to play a few acoustic live shows as a duo into 1999, occasionally with accompaniment (such as Philadelphia bassist Billy Warburton and drummer Lance Crow) and attempted to record an EP for record label Vital Cog with a drum machine as backing, but ended up putting Magnapop on an indefinite hiatus. Hopper moved to Los Angeles and stopped performing live music until the early 2000s, when Hopper, Morris, and a group of Seattle musicians demoed some Hopper/Morris songs. The band officially re-formed in 2003 with bassist Scott Rowe and drummer Brian Fletcher to tour the European festival circuit and record an album. In The Netherlands, Hopper also performed vocals on R.E.M.'s cover of \\"Favorite Writer\\" at two of the group's concerts on June 21 and 22. In 2005, Magnapop released their first album in nine years‚ÄîMouthfeel‚Äîon Amy Ray's Daemon Records. The re-formed group toured to support the record throughout the United States and the festival circuit in Europe and has continued to perform and record through 2010. The self-released album Chase Park was made available in late 2009. Musical style Hopper is known for her pop-influenced vocals and its interaction with Morris' particularly aggressive guitar-playing. Reviewers have called Hopper's singing \\"speak-in-tune\\" (College Music Journal)College Music Journal, issue 34 (June 1996), p. 40, The Guide to New Music, review by M. Tye Comer and \\"bell-voiced\\" (Billboard.) In addition, the vocal harmony between the two singers has defined the Magnapop's sound, especially on later releases that feature more of Morris' vocals.

Background  Cann was born in 1860 in Horrabridge, Devonshire, moving with his family to Northumberland in 1866. At the age of nine he began work in the coal mines. He moved to London in 1882 and migrated to Australia in 1887 following his marriage in 1885. After a brief period working as a coal miner at Port Kembla Cann moved to Broken Hill where he worked as a miner for BHP. He was also a Primitive Methodist lay preacher at this time.  Political career  Cann was elected president of the local branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association (A.M.A.) in early 1890, defeating the more radical previous president, Richard Sleath. When the AMA formed a local branch of the Labor Electoral League in 1891 Cann was preselected as candidate for the state parliament seat of Sturt and elected in the same year. Cann was elected unopposed as the sitting member, Wyman Brown, decided to retire after local unions passed a motion of no confidence in him. Other labour candidates including Sleath (then serving as AMA secretary) and William Ferguson (supported by the Barrier Ranges Trades and Labour Council) withdrew from the contest once it was clear Cann had the majority support of local unions. Cann faced significant local problems once elected. The far west of New South Wales was in a severe drought, and Broken Hill had no secure source of fresh water. Cann was able to persuade the Premier, Henry Parkes, to commission emergency supplies of water brought in from South Australia by train. An even more significant problem emerged with the defeat of the local union movement in 1892 miners' strike. The 18-week strike saw local union leaders arrested and imprisoned in Sydney and strikebreakers brought in to replace striking miners. Union membership collapsed following the defeat and many of the working conditions won in previous years were lost. While the defeat of the strike was a significant setback for the unions in Broken Hill, politically Labour was very successful in the 1890s. Cann was able to persuade the Dibbs government to divide the Electoral district of Sturt into three new seats, Alma, Broken Hill and a redrawn Sturt. Labour polled over 70 percent in all three new seats at the 1894 election, with Cann winning Broken Hill. Cann served as Labor's central campaign director for the 1897 election to the Federation Convention. Labor opposed the 1897 federation proposal, instead advocating a unicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage. This opposition to federation was controversial locally, and although the \\"No\\" vote was successful, it caused significant internal conflict within the Labor party in the far west. Cann continued to serve as MLA for Broken Hill until the seat was abolished in 1913, when he returned to the seat of Sturt. From 1912 to 1914 he was the Treasurer of New South Wales. In 1916 Cann was expelled from the Labor Party, and resigned to take the position of deputy chief commissioner of the New South Wales Government Railways. He was succeeded as the member for Sturt by the more radical Percy Brookfield. In 1914 his younger brother George joined him in the legislative Assembly, winning the 1914 Canterbury state by-election.

The film has a very strong anti-drug message. Plot summary The Cameron family seems, on the surface, to be the perfect family, but things are not as they seem. Their two teenage children, Scott and Sandy, fall in with the wrong crowds at their high school and eventually become involved with drug experimentation. Sandy, after ingesting angel dust made by her boyfriend in the school's chemistry lab, jumps through a glass window of the school (purposely cutting her arms with the cut glass in the process) and is subsequently paralyzed from the fall. A caring idealistic guidance counselor, Eileen Phillips, sees the problem that is going on in the school and, after other tragic incidents involving two other students (one of which involves Scott and his girlfriend smoking drugs and crashing their car off a cliff) and when no one else on the staff is willing to do anything about it, takes the steps to deal with and confront the problem. The aftermath of this tragedy makes Scott and Sandy's parents realize that even their \\"perfect\\" kids can be affected by drugs, especially after Scott has a violent reaction and goes into the hospital. At a school assembly, Eileen Phillips storms in and confronts the students about the increasing drug use, sending a message to the crowd about the effects of what the drug problem is doing to the kids and the tragedies that resulted because of it.

They are sold under an Open-source license. Following the release of the Vocaloid \\"Neo\\" version for the Mac, several hints were left on Macne Nana's Twitter that an official Vocaloid voicebank was in progress. It was confirmed and announced later in October 2013 that Macne Nana would be released for both the Vocaloid 3 software and the Vocaloid Neo software on January 31, 2014. History The Macne series interface Macne Nana version The idea of releasing a voicebank for Macintosh computers was conceptualized in the Japanese voice actress Haruna Ikezawa's regular column \\"Â§©Â£∞Âß´Ë™û Vox Reginae, Vox Dei\\" (\\"voice of the queen, voice of god,\\" a spoof of Asahi Shimbun's editorial article \\"Â§©Â£∞‰∫∫Ë™û Vox Populi, Vox Dei\\" or \\"voice of the people, voice of god\\") carried in the magazine Mac Fan by Mainichi Communications. It followed the success story of Hatsune Miku, a voice produced for the Vocaloid software which was produced for Microsoft Windows only but has no connection to the Vocaloid software development.link The Macne series gained popularity after it was discovered that the sound files could be imported into the singing software Utau. A plan was made to introduce new characters to the series in 2012 and as of October 2012, a selection of finalists have been chosen. In late December, the concept of turning all the Macne series into Vocaloid were spoken about. The most major factor in the process was the cost of doing so.

Compared to her sister White, she loses her temper easily and cries quite easily.

Extending mainly along Connecticut Route 179, near the geographic town center, is a well-preserved example of rural agricultural center in Connecticut, a role served until about 1920. The district includes many examples of Late Victorian and Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. and Description and history The area that is now the town of Canton was settled in the 18th century as part of Simsbury. In 1750 it was given status as a separate parish, and it was incorporated in 1806. The town center organized itself along a stretch of the town's major north-south road, now Route 179 that roughly parallels Cherry Brook. It was here that the Congregation Church was located (current building dating to 1814), and a general store and other local services arose. Cherry Brook was used as a power source for modestly scaled local enterprises, including sawmills and tanneries. This rural center was eventually supplanted by Collinsville in the early 20th century as a more important commercial and civic hub, and development has consequently been limited since about 1920. The historic district covers about of mainly rural landscape, and is roughly linear, extending along Route 179 between East Mountain and North Mountain Roads. A roughly triangular section bounded by West and Meadow Roads extends the district west of the main road. There 84 contributing buildings, most of which are either primary buildings (houses, schools, etc.) or major secondary buildings like barns. Most of the buildings are wood frame residences, in Federal or Greek Revival styles, although there are a few examples of later Victorian architecture. No buildings appear to date from the earliest time of the area's settlement. One of the oldest surviving houses in the district is the Caleb Case House built in 1785. Non- residential buildings include the church, a general store and blacksmith's shop, and several district school buildings which have been altered for other uses. Major modern intrusions include a Jehovahs Witnesses hall and the 1941 Cherry Brook School.

She has been deified as the \\"Saintly Mother of Lingnan\\" (). She died during a tour of Hainan. Former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai called her \\"the First Heroine of China\\", and President Jiang Zemin praised her as \\"the role model that the later generations should learn forever\\". Life Lady Xian was born in 512 to the chieftain of the Xian tribe of the Li people in Southern China. She lived during the Sui dynasty in what is now Guangdong in Southern China. Her family were hereditary leaders of their tribe.„ÄäÈ´òÂ∑ûÂéÜÂè≤Âêç‰∫∫-ÂÜºÂ§´‰∫∫„Äã È´òÂ∑ûÂú®Á∫ø. Accessed in December 23, 2014 She was a notable leader who successfully defended her tribe against its enemies, eventually earning her title as Lady of Qiaoguo. Her tribe's people were in frequent conflict with neighboring tribes. She often tried to prevent them from being involved in wars by relying on diplomacy and negotiations. Her brother Xian Ting, the governor () of Nanliangzhou (), was conceited from wealth (as a result of being trading partners with the Chinese) so he often harassed the surrounding counties or robbed them of their belongings, which made people in the Lingnan area miserable. Lady Xian often persuaded him not to do bad things so people's resentment subsided gradually. Thus, thousands of people from Dan'er Commandery () of Hainan were attracted by her fame and joined her.„ÄäÈöã‰π¶„Äã ÂõΩÂ≠¶. Accessed in December 23, 2014 At 535, she married Feng Pao, a Chinese general, and encouraged an appreciation of Chinese ways among her people. She also helped her Feng Pao with the local affairs. She was impartial and incorruptible when resolving the lawsuits. She would punish her tribe's people if they committed crimes. As a result, Feng established their authority in the local place. From then on, nobody dared to disobey the government decrees. Because she was a woman of a tribe that wished to remain autonomous from the Chen Dynasty, her accomplishments shocked many Chinese. It is thus worth noting how remarkable it is that any records of her written by Chinese historians exist at all. Emperor Chen Shubao of the Chen Dynasty had been impressed with her achievements and bestowed her with many awards, including the title \\"Lady of Qiaoguo\\". She died in 602 of old age and was honored with the posthumous name of Lady Chengjing (). Family Among her children, only Feng Pu was known by name. He accompanied his mother into many battles, and like her, he was bestowed awards by the Chen emperor. Lady Xian had three grandsons named Feng Hun, Feng Xian, and Feng Ang. They were all bestowed awards by the emperor. During the Chinese New Year or other festivals, Lady Xian would take out all her gifts sent by the emperors of the Liang, Chen and Sui dynasties and placed them in the yard. She told her grandsons that \\"You all should be loyal to the emperor. I had served emperors of three dynasties with loyalty! All these gifts granted by them were the reward of my loyalty. So I hope you all can think about that and be loyal to the emperor. (Original: \\"Ê±ùÁ≠âÂÆúÂ∞ΩËµ§ÂøÉÂêëÂ§©Â≠êÔºåÊàë‰∫ã‰∏â‰ª£‰∏ªÔºåÂîØÁî®‰∏ÄÂ•ΩÂøÉ„ÄÇ‰ªäËµêÁâ©‰ø±Â≠òÔºåÊ≠§Âø†Â≠ù‰πãÊä•‰πü„ÄÇÊÑøÊ±ùÁöÜÊÄùÂøµ‰πã!\\"). She asked her grandsons to be loyal to the emperor as she did. Main achievements Cultural development In the Southern and Northern Dynasties, human trafficking was very frequent in this area. According to the biography of Wang Sengru in the Book of Liang,(ÁéãÂÉßÂ≠∫ÔºåÂ≠óÂÉßÂ≠∫Ôºå‰∏úÊµ∑ÈÉØ‰∫∫ÔºåÈ≠èÂç´Â∞ÜÂÜõËÇÉÂÖ´‰∏ñÂ≠ô) Book of Liang, vol. 33 Wang Sengru was the Prefecture of Nanhai. Every year many foreign boats docked here because many people were sold in Gaoliang. These foreign businessmen traded their goods for people being sold here. At that time, many businessmen in this county made money by doing this trade, which the officials permitted and did not take any action to prevent it.(Âá∫‰∏∫ÂçóÊµ∑Â§™ÂÆàÔºåÈÉ°Â∏∏ÊúâÈ´òÂáâÁîüÂè£ÂèäÊµ∑Ëà∂ÊØèÂ≤ÅÊï∞Ëá≥ÔºåÂ§ñÂõΩË¥æ‰∫∫‰ª•ÈÄöË¥ßÊòì„ÄÇÊóßÊó∂Â∑ûÈÉ°‰ª•Âçä‰ª∑Â∞±Â∏ÇÔºåÂèà‰π∞ËÄåÂç≥ÂçñÔºåÂÖ∂Âà©Êï∞ÂÄçÔºåÂéÜÊîø‰ª•‰∏∫Â∏∏) When Lady Xian rose to power, she took efforts to promote Han feudal culture and successfully abolished the Li trafficking system. She told the Li people to do more good things and be loyal to the country. Moreover, she encouraged the Han Chinese's intermarriage to the people of the Li, which greatly promoted the ethnic communication and integration. Suppressing the Hou Jing Rebellion In 548, the Hou Jing rebelled against the Liang dynasty, which had a destructive effect on the whole country. In 550, Li Qianshi, the rebel leader from Gaozhou tried to entice Feng Pao to join the rebellion, but Lady Xian dissuaded him from joining the rebellion. He defeated Li Qianshi's forces, thus helping general Chen Baxian suppress the Hou Jing rebellion. Her achievement is recorded in detail in the Book of Sui. Quelling civil disturbances In 558, Chen Baxian established the Chen Dynasty. Xiao Bo, the feudal provincial of Guangzhou sent out troops to attack him, while some other ambitious provincial leaders rose in rebellion, throwing Lingnan into chaos and driving many locals into homelessness and poverty. To restore the peace of Lingnan, Lady Xian adopted the strategy named \\"cure-replaced wars\\". (). She posted notices to warn the governors of nearby counties not to join Xiao, but to focus on the public security and stop the fighting. She promised that if they stop the rebellion, they will not be punished. Meanwhile, she made strict discipline on her military, in which soldiers who committed crimes such as robbing or killing, will have their heads cut off and displayed in public. The rebel leaders took her advice so the insurgency subsided quickly.„ÄäÊ¥óÂ§´‰∫∫„Äã ‰∏≠ÊñáÁôæÁßëÂú®Á∫ø Accessed in December 25, 2014 Titles (Â∞ÅÂè∑) In the Liang dynasty (551), she was granted the honored name \\"Lady of Protection Hou\\" () for defeating the rebellious Li Qianshi. In the Chen dynasty (570), she was given the title of \\"Shi-Long Taifuren\\" (). But in the book of the History of the Northern Dynasties, she was given the title of \\"Taifuren of Gaoliang County\\" (). In the Sui dynasty (589), she got the honored name of \\"Furen of Songkang County\\" (). In 601, she was granted the name of \\"Lady of Qiaoguo\\" ().

In the Qing dynasty (1864), the Tongzhi Emperor granted her the name of \\"Ciyou\\" (). Temples Lady Xian was greatly honored for her great distribution by many emperors or the masses. So people built temples around the country to commemorate her. By the end of 1940s, there were already several hundred temples in China, especially in Lingnan. They were also built in Malaysia and Vietnam. The first temple was built in the end of the Sui dynasty. The largest and most important Temple of Madam Xian is in Gaozhou, which was visited by former Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 2000.

B Company, 184th Infantry, 7th Division was ordered to make a frontal assault. They were to be supported to their right (west) by C Company. Two platoons were able to make it close to the top of the target ridge, but alerted the Japanese defenders to their presence once the Americans began dropping grenades into the caves and underground positions they had encountered. The Japanese were able to dislodge both platoons with grenades, satchel charges and pre-sighted mortar fire. American forces suffered heavy casualties. One hour later, the Americans once again attempted a direct infantry assault against The Pinnacle; however, this time they provided supporting 105 mm artillery fire, light tank support, anti-tank guns, heavy machine guns, bazookas, 4.2 inch chemical mortars, 60 and 80 mm mortars. Despite this combined arms assault, Japanese defenders were once again able to drive the Americans off. Japanese soldiers had simply hidden in their caves during the pre-assault bombardment, then rushed back to their prepared positions to meet subsequent assaulting troops. At this point, Lt. Col. Daniel Maybury, Commander, 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry, made a change in tactics. He directed C Company up a draw just beyond the ridge that had been used by B Company. While B Company quickly worked their way up the ridge in an attempt to catch Japanese defenders out of their positions, C Company worked its way up the western approaches to The Pinnacle, in what turned out to be a difficult but partially covered route. The Pinnacle. Its western approaches, over which Company C moved to capture it, are shown above. While Lieutenant Tanigawa was able to direct the repulse of B Company from the observation points afforded to him by the structure of The Pinnacle, he was completely unaware of C Company advancing on his western flank. Following in the path of supporting fire, C Company quickly made their way to the top of the ridge without loss. The Americans, having achieved the element of surprise in their flanking maneuver, then proceeded to leisurely and methodically destroy the remaining Japanese with white phosphorus grenades and flamethrowers. Only 20 of the 110 defenders escaped to the south. With the Pinnacle reduced, the entire 7th Division line could move forward. Conclusion The Pinnacle had been a tough position to crack, yet it was only an outpost. The Pinnacle was undermanned, and no reinforcements were provided. During the action Lieutenant Tanigawa pleaded with his superiors for artillery support, but he was provided with neither the artillery nor an explanation of the refusal. By 6‚Äì7 April the XXIV Corps had unmasked the Shuri fortified zone, composed of many positions as fanatically defended as Pinnacle outpost and also heavily supported by artillery and fed by an almost endless stream of reinforcements from local reserve units.

The field is 18 km long and 3-5 km wide and is oriented from east to west. It is located a few kilometers south from the city of Batman, with the Raman oil field lying to the east. The Batman River is flowing nearby, on the western side of the Batman city. These two fields are separated by a narrow fault system. The oil is classified as heavy. It has a density of 9.7‚Äì15 API (1.002‚Äì0.966 g/cm3, 12 API or 1 g/cm3 on average) and a viscosity of 450‚Äì1000 cP at reservoir conditions.

The major oil production mechanism was expansion of fluid, which was pressurized to about 1800 psi, but the pressure dropped to about 400 psi due to extraction.

Although the inn looks very old, it was only built in 1933 as a private fishing lodge for Bickleigh Castle, located nearby in the woods behind the inn. The English Inns website cites the inn as \\"one of the most picturesque inns in the southwest of England\\", given its quaint river setting and thatched roof.

The Fisherman's Cot also has a function room which is often used for meetings, evening events and wedding receptions. Cuisine The inn has a carvery and is said to serve good-quality meat and fish dishes, such as herbed stuffed trout, mussels and Aberdeen Angus burgers. The inn is reported to have obtained the rights to fish a 3/4 mile stretch of the River Exe, providing the restaurant with an abundance of fresh fish to serve. The Waterside Bar of the inn overlooks the river and the bridge.

During his stay at the inn in Room Six, the river had flooded its banks and when he later wrote the famous song it was widely believed to have been the inspiration for the song with the bridge. The rumour was reported to have been quashed in 2003 when Art Garfunkel claimed that Paul Simon had been inspired to write the song from a hymn book, ignoring the fact that lyrics frequently combine multiple significances.

He composed the Christmas cantata in Leipzig in 1723 for the third day of Christmas, which is also the Feast of John the Evangelist, and first performed it on 27 December 1723.  History and text  Bach wrote the cantata in his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, as part of his first cantata cycle, for the Third Day of Christmas. The prescribed readings for the day are from the Epistle to the Hebrews, Christ is higher than the angels, () and the prologue of the Gospel of John, also called Hymn to the Word (). The unknown poet referred only in a general way to the readings and stressed the aspect that being loved by God in the way which Christmas shows, the believer does not have to be concerned about the \\"world\\" any more. Three chorales are included in the text, rarely found in Bach's cantatas, but also in , Bach's first cantata composed for Christmas in Leipzig and performed the day before, and in , written for 2 January 1724, only a few days later.

Character design XJ-0461, originally designated Warbot Defect B-54296, nicknamed Clank, is an escaped robot from Chairman Drek's robot plant on planet Quartu. After a high-speed chase, he crashes near a plateau on planet Veldin and catalyzes Ratchet's adventure. Clank has many attachments including a helipack, thrusterpack, and hydropack. Under certain circumstances, he can grow into a giant form to fight much larger enemies. He is mostly used as a character for tight spaces or areas in outer space without air. Clank spawned from an early idea involving a number of small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the three robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank. However, in later games the smaller robots appeared in sections where the player could control Clank, and they had various functions such as attacking and activating doors. Appearances Clank is a main character in the Ratchet & Clank series, first appearing in the game with the same name as an escaped robot. After meeting up with Ratchet, they travel various planets trying to stop the goals of Chairmen Drek, and looking for Captain Qwark to help them. Along the way, Ratchet keeps drifting from the goals that Clank wants to accomplish, causing him to get upset with Ratchet's selfishness. With Clank being the only way Ratchet can pilot his ship, he makes up with him, and gets back on track. In Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando, they are living the lives of heroes and get a call from the CEO of Megacorp, wanting them to help retrieve a dangerous prototype which was stolen. In Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, Ratchet and Clank help Captain Qwark defeat his past nemesis, Dr. Nefarious. Meanwhile, Clank is shown to be a movie star, acting as Secret Agent Clank (a PlayStation Portable game was released under the same name, and focuses on the adventures of Clank under this role). A great deal of new information regarding Clank's real origins is shown in the Future trilogy. During the events of Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, Clank is often visited by mysterious beings known as the Zoni and is warned that he faces some difficult decisions regarding his adventures with Ratchet. Clank is eventually taken away by the Zoni at the end of the game. In Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time, Clank is transported to the Great Clock where he learns that his creator is, in fact, a powerful Zoni named Orvus (his alternate name is also quoted as XJ-0461) and fulfils his intended purpose as Senior Caretaker of the Clock. After the final battle, Clank is left with a hard decision on whether to continue partnering Ratchet or leave him and stay at the Clock, but he ultimately decides to leave the Clock and stay with Ratchet. Clank is one of the six playable characters in PlayStation Move Heroes, and creates a rivalry with Sly Cooper character Bentley due to both of them having high intelligence. Both Ratchet and Clank also appear as one playable character in the crossover fighting game PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. Clank also appears as a non-playable character in Hot Shots Golf Fore! and the PlayStation 4 version of Super Bomberman R. Reception Douglass C. Perry of IGN described David Kaye's vocal performance as Clank in the original game as \\"quite engaging, and in some cases, charming, especially when he finishes a level or gains a weapon.\\" Gavin Frankle of Allgame found it hard to form an emotional bond with Ratchet or Clank, saying that Clank is \\"the stereotypical intellectual; stuffy and almost prudish to a fault\\". Benjamin Turner of GameSpy, after criticizing Ratchet, cited that Clank was \\"the complete opposite\\" of Ratchet and wished that the game was named after him instead of Ratchet. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution compared Clank to GIR of Invader Zim and C-3PO of the Star Wars franchise, and analyzed him as \\"the straight man to Ratchet's jokes, offering clueless intellectualism to contrast Ratchet's acid-tongue humor.\\" Clank's \\"awkward robot laugh\\" was described by Carlos McElfish of GameZone as \\"impossibly cute\\". Jeremy Dunham of IGN said that Clank's \\"dry sidekick humor is in great contrast to Jak's own sidekick Daxter\\". GamesRadar listed Clank on their list of \\"The 25 best new characters of the decade\\", describing him as a \\"quiet, collected and effortlessly charming robot with cool powers and cooler personality\\". Clank was named the 5th \\"Best Sidekick\\" by IGN, calling him \\"a true pal, and an obviously cool sidekick.\\". UGO.com listed Clank on their list of \\"The Cutest Video Game Characters\\" stating \\"Everyone wants a tiny robot to follow them around and do stuff for them\\".

VR was searching a diesel motor car to be used on low traffic regional services on non-electrified tracks years after the last of the earlier diesel motor car series had been decommissioned by the end of the 1980s, and diesel locomotive pulled passenger trains had been found to be uneconomical for small-demand services. VR had earlier experimented with converting an old unpowered passenger car into a diesel motor car, but the prototype was never put to service and VR ultimately decided to acquire all-new cars. After a failed purchase, 16 Dm12 units with 20 options were finally ordered from the Czech manufacturer ƒåKD Vagonka, now ≈†koda Vagonka, in 2001, at a price of 160 million FIM. The first unit arrived to Finland earlier than expected, on , after being tested in the Czech republic. VR was able to start traffic using the first unit between Joensuu and Pieks√§m√§ki on . After a month and a half of usage without problems, it was serviced in June 2005, including a change of seats and modifications to the air intake. The second unit was delivered in August 2005 and followed the first between Joensuu and Pieks√§m√§ki. More units soon followed, and they were used between Joensuu and Nurmes. At the end of the year, VR had received 11 units, nine of which were serving passengers. The units were delivered to VR in 2004‚Äì2006, entering commercial service in 2005. The units are used in regional and feeder services mostly in Eastern and Central Finland, but also on the Karjaa-Hanko route near the coast of the Gulf of Finland. The Dm12 is currently the only diesel motor car in Finland. All Dm12 units were withdrawn from service on after two fires in short succession, in Punkaharju on , and Keuruu on . The multiple units have been temporarily replaced with trains pulled with diesel locomotives or buses. The fires were a result of a fuel leak, which caused fuel to spill on the hot engine. The units are being re- entered in service during June 2012 after the faulty fuel lines are replaced. The nicknames for the Dm12 are Per√§kyl√§n Pendolino (Backwoods' Pendolino), \\"Viidakkopendolino\\" (jungle Pendolino) Skoda (after the manufacturer) and Demari (from type designation Dm12).  Specifications  Interior view of a Dm12.At a maximum, three Dm12 units can be coupled into a train to increase capacity. Each car has two passenger compartments, two entrance vestibules and a driver's cabin at each end of the car. The driver cabins have air conditioning. There are two places for wheelchair-using passengers, the unit has lifting platforms for wheelchair access and the toilet is designed to be accessible to the disabled. The heating of the passenger compartments uses waste heat from the diesel engines.  Livery  Dm12 units are painted in a distinctive red-gray colouring on a white background. As of June 2012, the two oldest units, 4401 and 4402, have been painted according to VR's white-green paintscheme.

It is a total conversion mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 developed by LudoCraft ltd. and TeamingStream ltd and was commercially released in 2008. The latter has received many awards in several games development competitions, and Former company has been selected among the 25 most interesting IT start-ups in Finland by Tietoviikko.T√§ss√§ ovat Suomen 25 mielenkiintoisinta it-startupia, 6 February 2010; http://www.tietoviikko.fi/taustat/article371633.ece Despite the young age of the serious game itself, the history of NoviCraft game goes back to the year 2002, when the first generation of the game was developed for research purposes at the University of Oulu, Finland to find out whether computer games could be used for learning . In 2009 NoviCraft game was granted with the best e-learning solution of the year ‚Äìaward in Finland's E-learning Center's competition (E-oppimiskeskus)NoviCraft is the best eLearning product 2009 - TeamingStream's training game wins award  Background  NoviCraft is a serious video game using Unreal Engine that puts teams to solve problems together through a virtual adventure placed on a prison island. The problems are solved precisely through the joint conversation and coordinated activities, where every puzzle requires all participants‚Äô activity and part taking into the conversation. Through game experiences NoviCraft supports business customers in social excellence, in learning to construct shared understanding together with different people in changing contexts. Furthermore, players will learn the meaning and importance of * Communication * Leading and building of psychological safety, giving and receiving help * Coordination, and goal orientation * Think-aloud; Sharing existing knowledge * Challenges with working in distributed virtual teams, strategy creation, and risk taking * Planning your work and executing according to the plan Due to the immersive nature of 3D games, the players are quickly engaged and behave in the way most natural to them since it is very hard to keep up a different role in the intensive game situations. The design of game requires active participation and demands the team members to negotiate and make decisions. It has been found that each player's avatar reinforces the active participation and gives new possibilities to share knowledge and monitor the stage of the other players. The game turns into an experience, which makes it a fruitful reference for further discussions concerning the players‚Äô way of communicating, acting in new and surprising situation and making joint decisions. By discussing about those experiences we stimulate people to be aware of their own behaviour as well as to understand better the challenges of group dynamics of their work community, teamwork and leadership  What is behind Novicraft game?  The goal of the NoviCraft team training is to give the team a collaborative learning experience of a shared distributed problem- solving situation. The tasks in the NoviCraft game have been scripted based on several years of scientific research to promote every participants‚Äòequal participation to the problem-solving activity. The tasks are built to launch the key mechanisms of collaborative learning, such as asking questions, helping others, explaining and listening. Through equal participation to the joint activity, the team has best chances for constructing shared view of situations, which nowadays is a key skill in every day work situations.  Constructing knowledge in teams  In order to be effective and successful in the solving of problems collaboratively, it is crucial that knowledge be continuously shared and constructed in teams. In practice, while team members search, collect, and share resources relevant to their problem solving, they construct knowledge that is shared between them. In successful collaboration, the team members echo and engage in the ideas of others by adding to each other's ideas rather than ignoring or rejecting many contributions.  Awareness of the team skills  Through the NoviCraft training, we aim to increase individual's awareness of the social aspects of teamwork. Promoting awareness of team processes is essential, since there is more to learning than content knowledge. People may not learn to interact in productive ways just by doing collective work‚Äîmany times, coaching in how to participate in effective collaboration and problem-solving is needed. It has been found that language plays a crucial role in learning, and for effective learning it is important to encourage participants to engage in certain ways of discussion and collaborative talk.  Building shared understanding  In practice, the team's construction of shared understanding in their knowledge-construction process is contextually tied to situated activities. For success, it is essential that in all collaborative situations, the group builds a shared solution in their discussion. Both the content and the process of the common task have to be continuously coordinated, which sets demands on learning and presents challenges for enhancing the collaboration skills of all who work in teams.  Game procedure   Goal setting  Discussions concerning the participants, goals and schedule of the training.  Team training pre- questionnaire  The participants fill in the pre-questionnaire concerning the team skills, current situation and development areas.  The Novicraft Game  (The actual game lasts about 4‚Äì5 hours) The game design is intended for inexperienced players, and the aim is that the playing of the game was not dependent on the participants‚Äô previous gaming experience. In the game, each participant is represented by an avatar figure and the discussion takes place through headphones and microphones with TeamSpeak software. The participants‚Äô individual and team game behaviour and performance can be monitored enabling detailed analysis, evaluation, retrospection, and recommendations for further development. The Novicraft could be described as a social-action adventure. The game's concept involves an escape story, where each team had to flee from a prison island by solving five interactive puzzles together. The players experiences their surroundings by using modifiable avatars, which they are able to choose from a set of options presented at the beginning of the game. Before the game, the participants practices the basic functionalities of the avatars in a tutorial field that lasted for five minutes. Before the game, the participants are also told to collaborate in order to solve the puzzles in the game. As part of the game, a short frame story appears on the computer screen before the tutorial field. In the story, participants are told that they are prisoners being held on an island, and one of the senior prisoners has heard of possible ways to escape. If they would follow the instructions of the senior prisoner as a team, than they would have a chance to escape. In the game, the participants has to accomplish five tasks that appears to the players in a certain order. After each task that they manage to achieve, a gate to a new field opens. The structuring of the game is purposefully designed to minimise pointless running and looking around in the environment in order to focus players‚Äô attention on teamwork and negotiation. The tasks in The Gate involves barrels, smoke signals, burner oil, dog fields, and balloons. Specifically, the tasks are as follows: # Task: each team member has to pass a gas field in a barrel with the help of others' instructions (Giving and receiving help, building psychological safety for teamwork, establishing communication and goal orientation) # Task: members has to send different coloured smoke signals in a certain order (Planning and coordination of tasks and actions to achieve a goal) # Task: members has to prepare an oil mixture from some of the ingredients given to them (Using creativity, experimenting and exploring as a team, sharing existing knowledge in joint problem solving) # Task: the team is split into two pairs who had to pass through a field while building fences to ward off angry dogs (Splitting the team into two sub- groups, both groups success needed to complete the task, innovation, risk taking) # Task: with the burner oil and tools gathered from the earlier tasks, the team has to build a balloon to escape from the prison island. (Complete the task together within the shared frame of reference created during the game experience) At the beginning of the game, each player receives different instructions called ‚Äúparchments‚Äù (virtual papers with some instructions for one of the tasks).  Personal reflection  Immediately after the game each participant fills in a brief questionnaire as an individual level reflection of the game experience. Everyone's answers are collected together in the game report produced automatically through the game software.  Team reflection  After the game experience the NoviCraft facilitator guides the team through a shared reflection concerning the game activities. The goal of the reflection carried out through group discussion is to help the participants to find the strengths and development themes of their teamwork on individual and team level. The activities are at first reflected based on the game, but deepened to the everyday team situations and roles towards the end.  Team- training feedback questionnaire  About one week after the participants fill in the feedback-questionnaire concerning the NoviCraft-training to continue to reflect their learning experiences.

After the death of Francis, he was a leader of the zelanti faction, opposed to what they considered a relaxation of the Rule as promulgated by the founder. Life Caesar of Speyer was born towards the close of the twelfth century. He became renowned as a preacher, and the number of women who responded, so enraged their husbands against him that he was obliged to leave his native city. In 1212 he went to Paris, where he studied theology under the famous crusade-preacher Conrad of Speyer. While in the Holy Land in 1217, Caesar was received into the Franciscan Order by Brother Elias of Cortona, the first provincial of Syria. Early in 1221 he returned to Italy with St. Francis and Peter of Catania. Donovan, Stephen. \\"Caesar of Speyer (or Spires).\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 January 2020 At the chapter of Pentecost Chapter held at Assisi in 1221, Caesar, together with twenty-five companions, was chosen to go to Germany, and after three months' preparation in the valley of Spoleto, the missionaries set out on their journey northward. They were welcomed by both clergy and people at Trent, Brixen, and other cities. The first Franciscan monastery north of the Alps was founded with the support of Otto I von Lobdeburg, Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg. In October of the same year the first provincial chapter of the order in Germany was convoked by Caesar at Worms.Forster OFM, Wilhelm, \\"Caesarius von Speyer\\", Neue Deutsche Biographie 3 (1957), p. 89 The famous missionary, John of Piancarpino, and the chronicler, Jordan of Giano were both present at this chapter; on its conclusion the friars dispersed throughout the different provinces of Germany, according to Caesar's instructions, to meet again the following year. In 1223 Caesar, accompanied by Thomas of Celano, returned to Assisi to be present at the general chapter of Pentecost, and at his own request was relieved of the office of provincial minister. The Rule of 1223 was probably written by Caesar of Speyer at the dictation of St. Francis. Of the remaining fifteen years of Caesar's life little is known. He was probably in Italy, with Bernard of Quintavalle, Giles of Assisi, and the other companions of St. Francis, encouraging the friars by word and work to remain faithful to their rule and life, and warning them against the innovations of the Relaxati. Jordan of Giano says of Caesar at this time: \\"He was a man wholly given to contemplation, most zealous for evangelica poverty and so commended by the other friars that he was esteemed the most saintly after St. Francis.\\" Owing to his opposition towards the Relaxati Caesar was imprisoned by order of the minister general, Brother Elias, and in 1239 met a violent death at the hands of the lay brother who had been appointed to guard him. There seems, however, no warrant for the opinion expressed by some that he was murdered by order of Elias, and the slight colouring which Angelo da Clareno and Ubertino of Casale give to their accounts of his tragic end is due to the bias and bitterness against Elias's party which characterize all the writings of the \\"Spirituals\\".

The story is about a young girl named Christine Carpenter, who on her first day of her sophomore year at Thomas Jefferson High School, discovers she has the amazing ability to read the minds of others. At first, she thinks she is cursed with these powers but eventually comes to terms with them and becomes a superhero. The story is one of the few novels written about superheroes that is not a comic book. The novel is essentially a book about heroism and it teaches the values of being a hero even to those without powers. Plot On Christine Carpenter's first day of her sophomore year at Thomas Jefferson High School she makes a startling discovery. She can hear peoples‚Äô thoughts. After convincing herself she's not going crazy, Chris must learn to control her amazing mind-reading ability. Using her power she quickly realizes her crush, the captain of the football team, is also blessed with a special ability. She is soon sucked into a world she never thought possible when two more of her classmates, and a teacher, turn out to have powers as well. What are they meant to do with their special gifts that can either help, or harm others? Christine soon finds out when a monster, lurking in the depths of her school, threatens to murder the student population. When it becomes apparent that the creature is someone she knows, she must decide whether to try and save him, or destroy the beast. It is a difficult choice, but one that ultimately takes her from being an ordinary high school student to being a hero. With this, Christine learns that being a hero doesn't mean having superpowers, it is ultimately the decisions she makes that are the distinguishing factors. Supplementary work High School Heroes also has some supplementary stories published in comic book form on WeVolt.com. The stories contained here focus more on the minor characters of the novel, such as Savanah Stephenson and Bobby Barnes. Themes One of the major themes of High School Heroes is that it is the actions of the individual that makes them a hero, and that even small actions can make a person a hero in the eyes of others. This theme is most exemplified in the novel during the scene where Christine Carpenter and Ethan Everett help a man who dresses as a superhero, but has no powers, Captain Falcon, distribute toys to needy children. Another great theme is the idea that power does corrupt and that a person must fight against that corruption. During the novel, Christine finds herself losing her friends because she is using her mind control powers to influence them. Once she realizes the error of her ways, it is difficult for her to control herself again. Origins James Mascia says that he got the inspiration to write this story when he had a conversation at Comic Con with someone about how there were very few superhero stories published outside of the comic book or graphic novel genre. So, he set out to write a story that was just that: a superhero story that had no ties to a comic. He then created the character of Christine Carpenter, and decided she would have not only the ability to read minds, but also be able to show people their greatest fears. The original story of Christine was published in the magazine A Thousand Faces, a journal of superhuman fiction. After having several stories about Christine and her friends published in A Thousand Faces, Mascia decided it was time for them to take on a larger adventure, and in October 2008 set out to write a novel. The novel took nearly nine months to write and another five months of editing before finally sending it out to publishers. After many rejections, Mascia sold the manuscript of High School Heroes to L&L; Dreamspell. Nearly a year later, the book was published.

Construction and completion The Long Walk, Windsor The act enacted various changes around Windsor in the light of the changing nature of Windsor Castle, the desire of Queen Victoria for greater privacy and the new railways being built in Berkshire at the time. Several new roads were built in the area and historic highways closed. Two new cast iron bridges were built over the River Thames to accommodate the changes.Tighe and Davis, pp.655-6. Among the most notable changes was the demolition of Datchet Bridge over the River Thames. The crossing linked Windsor in Berkshire to Datchet, Buckinghamshire. Originally a ferry crossing, Queen Anne had a wooden bridge constructed in 1706. However, the crossing would later become a cause of financial contention between the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire over its maintenance costs. Resulting in its nickname, \\"The Divided Bridge\\". Under the Windsor Castle Act 1848, the bridge was demolished and the original Windsor Road between Datchet's High Street and Park Street, Windsor was closed. Victoria Bridge slightly upstream, and Albert Bridge slightly downstream were built to replace Datchet. Both new bridges opened in 1851. Old Windsor Road was replaced with a highway, to the south, which crossed the newly constructed Albert Bridge near Old Windsor. The entire Berkshire side of the Thames (including the towpath) became part of the private grounds of Windsor Great Park. The demolition of Datchet Bridge remains the only case on the entire Thames where a main crossing has been completely removed and not replaced.

Russell Art Show in 1999 and some years later he suggested to Funk that he could design a sculpture of a Clydesdale horse to be given as an award to exemplary employees of Funk's Express Employment Professionals company in Oklahoma City. A deal was struck between the two that resulted in Parker casting a 50-piece edition called Express Ranch Clydesdale. Over time, Funk has added several more Parker sculptures to his collection, including a monumental bronze elk sculpture for the entrance to his ranch. Funk, who is a major donor to the western town exhibit called \\"Prosperity Junction\\" at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, said he hopes that the authentic late 19th century exhibit will help give something back to the community while giving the rest of the country a taste of the American West.

Director Major C. C. Moseley was one of only three school directors selected across America to set the standards for the pre-World War II civilian pilot training program. The institute was first set up in the terminal building of the Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale, California, expanding to neighboring hangars and buildings around the airport. Both TWA and American Airlines flew transcontinental service from the airport. During World War II, over 7500 mechanics were trained at the facility. In 1950 the institute became part of the Grand Central Aircraft Company and Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute was renamed as the Cal-Aero Technical Institute. The U.S. Air Force used the institute to train mechanics on contract until 1952. Enrollment dropped sharply after the cancellation of the contract and the facility closed in 1954. Coursework At its peak, CWTI had eight fields of study. *Aeronautical Engineering *Post Graduate Aeronautical Engineering *Master Aviation Mechanic *Specialized Engine *Specialized Airplane *Specialized Sheet Metal *Aeronautical Drafting *Aircraft Blueprint Reading History The Institute taught practical aircraft design with students producing actual aircraft that went into production. Bowlus 1-S-2100 Crosby CR-4 Martin Schempp taught courses in aircraft design at the CWTI. Together with students, they developed the 1932 Super Sailplane which served as the prototype for the Bowlus 1-S-2100 Senior Albatross \\"Falcon\\" glider. This aircraft is on display in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Richard C. du Pont was an early student who worked on the program and used the expertise gained to found the Bowlus-DuPont Sailplane Company in 1934. In 1935, students built the Al Novotney designed Bunting I racer which competed in the National Air Races. The Curtiss Coupe was designed by students and put in limited production by Curtiss-Wright in Robertson, Missouri. Students also helped develop and construct the Burrows R-6, Rider R-6, Crosby C6R3, and Crosby CR-4 racing aircraft.

It published the Labour Leader as well as other ILP material. It was originally located at 30 Blackfriars Street. In July 1915 Herbert Nield, Conservative MP for Ealing, raised in parliament his concerns about the activities of the Union of Democratic Control (UDC) and the ILP were holding \\"over 200 meetings weekly\\" and distributing literature. Following police raids, censorship was imposed on the Labour Leader, but the police in Manchester were cautious in seizing only sample copies of UDC literature. As it happened the Salford magistrates did not deem the material to be illegal. From March 1916 the NLP printed The Tribunal, a weekly newspaper, for the No Conscription Fellowship. The police raided the NLP and dismantled the press, but The Tribunal continued to be published via a secret press which the police had not found. Blackfriars Press The Blackfriars Press Limited was formed as a subsidiary in Manchester in 1914 to undertake work. It moved to Leicester in 1922. Annie Maxton (the sister of James Maxton) and Emrys Hughes were both one time members of the management committee. The company was the first in the UK to print Nescaf√© labels.

He has been a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly since 2010, representing Murray Valley until 2014 and Ovens Valley thereafter. He was the shadow minister for sport, veterans, gaming and liquor control until March 2018, stepping down in light of the decision of Victoria Police to formally charge McCurdy with fraud offences. Legal controversies In September 2014, PGW Agriservices issued a writ against McCurdy in the County Court of Victoria claiming damages in the sum of $375,741 for misleading and deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct contrary to the Fair Trading Act. The claims pertain to McCurdy's pre-politics career as a real estate agent and commissions worth $375,741 he received in respect of the sale of two farms, the sale of 'Malmo' located 50 km north of Shepparton for $7.8 million in July 2009 and 'Pinegrove' in Katamatite for $3.9 million in December 2009. Both properties were sold to a Chinese purchaser, Xing Long International. The statement of claim alleged that McCurdy had forged the letterhead of his former colleague and employer, Andrew Gilmour, to profit from the sales after McCurdy had ceased his employment with PGG Wrightson and having told Gilmour that the sales had \\"fallen over\\" and \\"were not proceeding due to the lack of finance\\". McCurdy settled the civil claim against him later that year. In October 2014, it was revealed that McCurdy had been accused by a long-serving former Nationals staffer, Jillian McGillivray, of harassment and bullying, with lawyers for McGillivray expecting her case to be listed before the Wangaratta Magistrates Court in November 2014. McCurdy denied any wrongdoing. McCurdy was criticised by Liberal MP Tim Smith in 2019 for employing his wife and one of his daughters in his electorate office at taxpayer expense, which Smith described as \\"totally acceptable\\". However, unlike their federal counterparts, state MPs are not prohibited from employing family members in taxpayer-funded roles. Criminal trial In July 2017, it was reported that McCurdy was being investigated by police for alleged fraud after complaints that, when working as a real estate agent in 2009, he had falsified documents to secure sales commissions worth about $375,000. Victoria Police searched McCurdy's office and residence as part of their investigation. In March 2018, police charged McCurdy with multiple fraud offences, and he stood down from his shadow ministry portfolios. In October 2018 it was announced that he would stand trial on ten fraud charges. In March 2019, the Crown successfully convinced the County Court to move the fraud trial from the Shepparton County Court (located near McCurdy's electorate) to the Melbourne County Court. McCurdy successfully delayed the trial until May 2020 due to the unavailability of his barrister, Ian Hill QC.

Birch was awarded the first contract for overland service on the \\"Southern Route\\", designated Route 8076. This contract required a semi-monthly service in four- horse coaches, scheduled to leave San Antonio and San Diego on the ninth and the 24th of each month, with 30 days allowed for each trip. Foundation of the Line Birch envisioned that at New Orleans, one could take a five-times- a-week mail steamer to to Indianola, Texas. There one transferred to a daily line of four-horse mail coaches traveling to San Antonio, Texas. Then one would take the San Antonio and San Diego Line from San Antonio via the San Antonio-El Paso Road and then continue north to Mesilla and take the Southern Emigrant Trail from there to San Diego. Once on the Pacific Coast the passenger could board a California Steam Navigation Company vessel to San Francisco. To accomplish this Birch entered a partnership with George H. Giddings, of the San Antonio-El Paso Mail that already ran over half of the route to La Mesilla.Beth Schneider, \\"GIDDINGS, GEORGE HENRY,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed November 30, 2013. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. 87 watering places and stage stations were organized by Superintendent Isaiah C. Woods, formerly of Adams & Company of California in San Francisco. On the first mail run, they were setting up the line as the mule trains and coaches journeyed west from San Antonio. Superintendent Woods prepared a self-contained outfit for this journey across the unsettled country of Texas, New Mexico Territory and Southern California with almost no existing infrastructure. The vehicles used were celerity wagons or mud wagons, also called ambulances (which was the military use for the same type of vehicle at that time), rather than the better known Concord stagecoach. Stations, water stops and camping places Water holes were set up at intervals but many were unmanned and actual stations sometimes were separated by as much as .Victor Walsh, State Park Historian, Celebrating the West on the Move, 150th Anniversary of the Arrival of the Overland Mail, San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line, Old Town San Diego State Historic Park website , accessed December 14, 2010 These first stations were at most a brush corral and a jacal to house the keeper, while most were merely camping places at springs or stream crossings; camps would be made where the coaches stopped for the night. Only the three at San Antonio, El Paso and San Diego had substantial buildings. The largest and most important station between El Paso and San Diego was at Maricopa Wells, Arizona, the dividing point on the route, where the eastbound and westbound mails met and turned back. Here was erected an adobe house and corral. During the company's existence it employed 65 men in all capacities, and owned 50 coaches and 400 mules.

The second mail, which left San Antonio July 24, was sent by coach and arrived in San Diego 38 days later. The average rate of travel over the route was about a day. Following the death of Birch at sea before the first mails reached their destinations, his contract was transferred to George H. Giddings and R. E. Doyle. Woods was retained as superintendent with company headquarters in New York. Only about 40 trips were ever made over the entire route before the service was curtailed. Supplanted by the Butterfield Overland Mail On September 20, 1858, the Butterfield Overland Mail Company began operating their stageline over the road, and using the station sites pioneered by Birch and Woods from El Paso, Texas, to Warner's Ranch, California. The San Antonio-San Diego Line was not absorbed by the Butterfield line but on December 1, 1858, the portion of the route between El Paso and Fort Yuma was cut from the service because it duplicated the service of the Butterfield Butterfield Overland. The service from San Antonio to El Paso and from Fort Yuma to San Diego was improved from semi-monthly to weekly trips and its subsidy was increased. During the year 1860, the west end of the route from Fort Yuma to San Diego was ended, leaving nothing but the portion from San Antonio to Camp Stockton which was put on a weekly basis. Between Camp Stockton and El Paso it was put on a weekly basis. The service was thus improved to a weekly basis all the way from New Orleans to San Francisco. Overland Mail Corporation After the final suspension of the Butterfield Overland mail, March 12, 1861, the San Antonio and San Diego Mail Line reorganized and merged its interests under the title of the Overland Mail Corporation. In May 1861, this company was given a new contract for the year ending June 30, 1862, to operate a mail service over the entire route from San Antonio via Camp Stockton, to Tucson and points in California. An attempt was made to fulfil the contract, beginning April 1, but with the development of the Civil War, and Apache attacks on the stations and coaches of the line resulting from the Bascom Affair, the contractors were compelled to give up. The eastern portion of the line was curtailed June 30, 1861. The end came when the Camp Stockton to Tucson part of the line was discontinued August 2, 1861.Basil C.

E. Breitenbach (best known for his painting Proverbidioms). It is a so-called \\"lost\\" collaboration with Jim Morrison of The Doors, intended for use on Morrison's An American Prayer album, and completed shortly before Morrison's death. The Jim Morrison Triptych In the fall of 1970, while at college, Breitenbach sent pictures of his surrealistic artwork to Jim Morrison and offered to paint an album cover. Morrison accepted and sent Breitenbach his ideas for the painting, along with two autographed, private editions of his poetry. Morrison liked the finished product and asked if he could use it on an album of poetry he was working on. This was his An American Prayer album published seven years after Morrison's death. Unfortunately, the album‚Äôs producers were not aware of Morrison‚Äôs intention to use the painting. The existence of this lost painting collaboration came to light decades later, when the artist posted it on his website.Silva, Rui (2008) Contigo Torno-Me Real. Edi√ß√µes Afrontamento. Morrison sent the artist these suggestions for the painting, \\"Try doing a triptych. The left panel depicting a radiant moon- lit beach and an endless stream of young naked couples running silently along the water's edge. On the beach, a tiny infant grins at the universe and around its crib stand several ancient, old people ... The center, a modern city or metropolis of the future at noon, insane with activity ... The last panel, a view through a car windshield at night on a long straight desert highway.\\"T.E.Breitenbach Archives: Feature Articles Morrison biographer Jerry Hopkins, in a letter to Breitenbach, explained the meaning of the painting: \\"the beach scene ... is a variation on a dream he told several people he had ... The center would be an extension of his interest in chaos and insanity ... and the final panel refers to a scene from his childhood when he and his father came upon an overturned truck, dead and injured Indians scattered 'on dawn's highway bleeding.' (See the lyric of Peace Frog.\\") Biographer Stephen Davis suggests, \\"These vivid scenes of death and rebirth were reflective of the new beginning Jim himself was seeking.\\" Davis also suggests that Jim had in mind two recent poems \\"Vast Radiant Beach\\" and \\"Come, They Crooned the Ancient Ones\\".Davis, Stephen (2004) Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend. Many years later, Breitenbach turned an idea from Morrison's poems \\"The Lords\\" and \\"The New Creatures\\" into an illustrated fantasy novel titled Grumparar's the New Creatures: An Adventure and Field Guide. Morrison described the Lords as a hidden, secretive group that somehow controlled us from behind the scenes, though in Breitenbach's book these characters are far less sinister.

It survives as a single complete copy of a 12th- century woodblock printed book that was discovered in the Tangut city of Kharakhoto. In addition, a single page from a different copy of the same edition of the Pearl in the Palm was found at the Northern Mogao Caves in 1989. The book transcribes the pronunciation of Chinese words into Tangut characters, and the pronunciation of Tangut characters into Chinese characters, and so is a very important source for Tangut historical phonology, and was the primary source before the publication of monolingual Tangut dictionaries. Discovery In 1909, the Russian explorer Pyotr Kozlov unearthed a number of texts and artefacts in Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia, including the Pearl in the Palm and transported them back to St. Petersburg, Russia. There, Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov, professor at Saint Petersburg State University, who was aware of its value, added them to his collection. It is now in the collection of the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. In 1912, Chinese scholars Luo Zhenyu and Feng Ge visited Ivanov upon learning about the work in his possession, and were given access to nine pages, which they photocopied for study. In 1922 Luo Zhenyu met Ivanov again, in Tianjin. It was only then he would only have access to the full text, then ordered his son to make a full copy. The Belgian scholar Luc Kwanten visit to the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, and was able to photograph the whole of \\"The Pearl in the Palm\\". In 1982, the book finally saw the light of day when the photographed version was published in the United States. Content and style The original book consists of 37 xylograph folios in concertina format. The preface is identical content written in both Chinese and Tangut. From the sentence \\"How can you mix with foreigners without learning foreign words, How can you be counted amongst the Han without learning Han words\\" (‰∏çÂ≠∏Áï™Ë®ÄÔºåÂâáË±àÂíåÁï™‰∫∫‰πãÁúæÔºõ‰∏çÊúÉÊº¢Ë™ûÔºåÂâáË±àÂÖ•Êº¢‰∫∫‰πãÊï∏) it is clear that the book aimed to facilitate the Tanguts and the Chinese to learn each other's languages. The book contains words 414 CPC, according to three powers are divided into nine categories: celestial bodies, celestial images, sky changes, terrestrial bodies, terrestrial images, terrestrial use, human body, human phase, human matters. One category is the most extensive content: personnel issues accounts for half of all the content. Each entry contains four elements: from right to left, Tangut phonetics in Chinese, Tangut script, Chinese script, and Chinese phonetics in Tangut.

The Union, \\"a prototype for self-help and social service organizations,\\" was one of the most important organizations for Atlanta's social services, and worked in part by networking with the city's progressive whites. One of the organizations influenced by it was the Women's Political Council, of Montgomery, Alabama. It was dissolved in the 1970s. History Foundation The Atlanta Neighborhood Union was founded by Lugenia Burns Hope, a social reformer and the wife of Morehouse College president John Hope. The organization got started in June 1908, when Hope convened with eight other middle-class women. At the time, Atlanta was \\"the most segregated city in Georgia,\\" and black children did not have a place to play: in Atlanta, there was \\"not a single playground or park for black children.\\" In the end, the women got Morehouse College to give up some of its grounds for a playground; this success encouraged the group to continue. Morehouse College, especially the president's mansion, also served as a meeting place during the organization's early years. The Union's aim was to initiate settlement projects to aid underprivileged black families. The city's neighborhoods were divided into districts, each of which had a board of directors which investigated living conditions in its area, especially the schooling situation. It collected demographic data to identify what types of programs would assist underprivileged citizens, and quickly started classes that taught such subjects as home and personal care. It sponsored health clinics and established after-school programs, and in 1909 began its political activity when it petitioned the Atlanta city council \\"to rid the community of 'a house of questionable character.'\\" The Union started a health clinic in 1915, which examined thousands of children, enrolled parents in health classes, and had boys' and girls' clubs. It made sure the city paved streets and provided adequate lighting and sewage treatment, and it replaced dilapidated houses. The Union was especially interested in education, and besides providing classes itself, it petitioned the Atlanta Board of Education already in 1913 to build two new schools. Organizers at the district level investigated every single school, and reported that they were too small, improperly ventilated and dark, and generally overcrowded. These reports and lobbying efforts led to teachers' salaries being raised and a makeshift school being built in South Atlanta. Professionalization In the 1920s, the Union sought to professionalize, and to that end founded the Atlanta School of Social Work. During the Great Depression, it sought help from the Fulton County Relief Center, but met with race-based opposition from white city officials. The Union had received complaints that no Christmas gifts were given to destitute blacks, though whites did receive such assistance. Hope confronted a city official, and after she was grudgingly granted some gifts, the official added, \\"The problem of it is that you people do not contribute to these things,\\" after which she explained that blacks were tax-paying citizens just as whites were. In the 1930s, the Union went into decline, in part because men's organizations, such as the Atlanta Urban League, began to be active in the field of social work and welfare, and often employed professional workers.Ferguson 279. Still, in the early 1930s the organization's health clinic added dental and maternal care; annually, it examined more than 4,000 people. Later scholarship The Union and its founder are the subject of Jacqueline Anne Rouse's Lugenia Burns Hope, Black Southern Reformer. Recent scholarship has studied the relationship between John Hope's stereotypical masculine language and activism and the limited space it allotted his wife, and to which extent such organizations had a \\"maternalist\\" ideology.

English translation. in order to develop the machinery of homological algebra for modules and for sheaves in a unified manner. The theory of these categories was further developed in Pierre Gabriel's seminal thesis in 1962. To every algebraic variety V one can associate a Grothendieck category \\\\operatorname{Qcoh}(V), consisting of the quasi-coherent sheaves on V. This category encodes all the relevant geometric information about V, and V can be recovered from \\\\operatorname{Qcoh}(V) (the Gabriel‚ÄìRosenberg reconstruction theorem). This example gives rise to one approach to noncommutative algebraic geometry: the study of \\"non-commutative varieties\\" is then nothing but the study of (certain) Grothendieck categories. Definition By definition, a Grothendieck category \\\\mathcal{A} is an AB5 category with a generator. Spelled out, this means that * \\\\mathcal{A} is an abelian category; * every (possibly infinite) family of objects in \\\\mathcal{A} has a coproduct (also known as direct sum) in \\\\mathcal{A}; * direct limits of short exact sequences are exact; this means that if a direct system of short exact sequences in \\\\mathcal{A} is given, then the induced sequence of direct limits is a short exact sequence as well. (Direct limits are always right-exact; the important point here is that we require them to be left-exact as well.) * \\\\mathcal{A} possesses a generator, i.e. there is an object G in \\\\mathcal{A} such that \\\\operatorname{Hom}(G,-) is a faithful functor from \\\\mathcal{A} to the category of sets. (In our situation, this is equivalent to saying that every object X of \\\\mathcal{A} admits an epimorphism G^{(I)}\\\\rightarrow X, where G^{(I)} denotes a direct sum of copies of G, one for each element of the (possibly infinite) set I.) The name \\"Grothendieck category\\" neither appeared in Grothendieck's T√¥hoku paper nor in Gabriel's thesis; it came into use in the second half of the 1960s in the work of several authors, including Jan-Erik Roos, Bo Stenstr√∂m, Ulrich Oberst, and Bodo Pareigis. (Some authors use a different definition in that they don't require the existence of a generator.) Examples * The prototypical example of a Grothendieck category is the category of abelian groups; the abelian group \\\\Z of integers can serve as a generator. * More generally, given any ring R (associative, with 1, but not necessarily commutative), the category \\\\operatorname{Mod}(R) of all right (or alternatively: left) modules over R is a Grothendieck category; R itself can serve as a generator. * Given a topological space X, the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on X is a Grothendieck category. (More generally: the category of all sheaves of right R-modules on X is a Grothendieck category for any ring R.) * Given a ringed space (X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X), the category of sheaves of OX-modules is a Grothendieck category. * Given an (affine or projective) algebraic variety V (or more generally: a quasi-compact quasi- separated scheme), the category \\\\operatorname{Qcoh}(V) of quasi-coherent sheaves on V is a Grothendieck category. * Given a small site (C, J) (i.e. a small category C together with a Grothendieck topology J), the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on the site is a Grothendieck category.  Constructing further Grothendieck categories  * Any category that's equivalent to a Grothendieck category is itself a Grothendieck category. * Given Grothendieck categories \\\\mathcal{A_1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathcal{A_n}, the product category \\\\mathcal{A_1}\\\\times\\\\ldots\\\\times\\\\mathcal{A_n} is a Grothendieck category. * Given a small category \\\\mathcal{C} and a Grothendieck category \\\\mathcal{A}, the functor category \\\\operatorname{Funct}(\\\\mathcal{C},\\\\mathcal{A}), consisting of all covariant functors from \\\\mathcal{C} to \\\\mathcal{A}, is a Grothendieck category. * Given a small preadditive category \\\\mathcal{C} and a Grothendieck category \\\\mathcal{A}, the functor category \\\\operatorname{Add}(\\\\mathcal{C},\\\\mathcal{A}) of all additive covariant functors from \\\\mathcal{C} to \\\\mathcal{A} is a Grothendieck category. * If \\\\mathcal{A} is a Grothendieck category and \\\\mathcal{C} is a localizing subcategory of \\\\mathcal{A}, then both \\\\mathcal{C} and the Serre quotient category \\\\mathcal{A}/\\\\mathcal{C} are Grothendieck categories. Properties and theorems Every Grothendieck category contains an injective cogenerator. For example, an injective cogenerator of the category of abelian groups is the quotient group \\\\mathbb{Q}/\\\\mathbb{Z}. Every object in a Grothendieck category \\\\mathcal{A} has an injective hull in \\\\mathcal{A}. This allows to construct injective resolutions and thereby the use of the tools of homological algebra in \\\\mathcal{A}, in order to define derived functors. (Note that not all Grothendieck categories allow projective resolutions for all objects; examples are categories of sheaves of abelian groups on many topological spaces, such as on the space of real numbers.) In a Grothendieck category, any family of subobjects (U_i) of a given object X has a supremum (or \\"sum\\") \\\\sum_i U_i as well as an infimum (or \\"intersection\\") \\\\cap_i U_i, both of which are again subobjects of X. Further, if the family (U_i) is directed (i.e. for any two objects in the family, there is a third object in the family that contains the two), and V is another subobject of X, we haveStenstr√∂m, Prop. V.1.1 :\\\\sum_{i}(U_i\\\\cap V) = \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i}U_i\\\\right) \\\\cap V. Grothendieck categories are well-powered (sometimes called locally small, although that term is also used for a different concept), i.e. the collection of subobjects of any given object forms a set (rather than a proper class). It is a rather deep result that every Grothendieck category \\\\mathcal{A} is complete,Stenstr√∂m, Cor. X.4.4 i.e. that arbitrary limits (and in particular products) exist in \\\\mathcal{A}. By contrast, it follows directly from the definition that \\\\mathcal{A} is co-complete, i.e. that arbitrary colimits and coproducts (direct sums) exist in \\\\mathcal{A}. Coproducts in a Grothendieck category are exact (i.e. the coproduct of a family of short exact sequences is again a short exact sequence), but products need not be exact. A functor F \\\\colon {\\\\cal A} \\\\to {\\\\cal X} from a Grothendieck categoriy \\\\mathcal{A} to an arbitrary category \\\\mathcal{X} has a left adjoint if and only if it commutes with all limits, and it has a right adjoint if and only if it commutes with all colimits. This follows from Peter J. Freyd's special adjoint functor theorem and its dual. The Gabriel‚ÄìPopescu theorem states that any Grothendieck category \\\\mathcal{A} is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category \\\\operatorname{Mod}(R) of right modules over some unital ring R (which can be taken to be the endomorphism ring of a generator of \\\\mathcal{A}), and \\\\mathcal{A} can be obtained as a Gabriel quotient of \\\\operatorname{Mod}(R) by some localizing subcategory. As a consequence of Gabriel‚ÄìPopescu, one can show that every Grothendieck category is locally presentable. Every small abelian category \\\\mathcal{C} can be embedded in a Grothendieck category, in the following fashion. The category \\\\mathcal{A}:=\\\\operatorname{Lex}(\\\\mathcal{C}^{op},\\\\mathrm{Ab}) of left-exact additive (covariant) functors \\\\mathcal{C}^{op}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathrm{Ab} (where \\\\mathrm{Ab} denotes the category of abelian groups) is a Grothendieck category, and the functor h\\\\colon\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{A}, with C\\\\mapsto h_C=\\\\operatorname{Hom}(-,C), is full, faithful and exact. A generator of \\\\mathcal{A} is given by the coproduct of all h_C, with C\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}. The category \\\\mathcal{A} is equivalent to the category \\\\text{Ind}(\\\\mathcal C) of ind-objects of \\\\mathcal{C} and the embedding h corresponds to the natural embedding \\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to\\\\text{Ind}(\\\\mathcal C). We may therefore view \\\\mathcal{A} as the co-completion of \\\\mathcal{C}.  Special kinds of objects and Grothendieck categories  An object X in a Grothendieck category is called finitely generated if, whenever X is written as the sum of a family of subobjects of X, then it is already the sum of a finite subfamily. (In the case {\\\\cal A} = \\\\operatorname{Mod}(R) of module categories, this notion is equivalent to the familiar notion of finitely generated modules.) Epimorphic images of finitely generated objects are again finitely generated. If U\\\\subseteq X and both U and X/U are finitely generated, then so is X. The object X is finitely generated if, and only if, for any directed system (A_i) in {\\\\cal A} in which each morphism is a monomorphism, the natural morphism \\\\varinjlim \\\\mathrm{Hom}(X,A_i)\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Hom}(X,\\\\varinjlim A_i) is an isomorphism.Stenstr√∂m, Prop. V.3.2 A Grothendieck category need not contain any non-zero finitely generated objects. A Grothendieck category is called locally finitely generated if it has a set of finitely generated generators (i.e. if there exists a family (G_i)_{i\\\\in I} of finitely generated objects such that to every object X there exist i\\\\in I and a non-zero morphism G_{i}\\\\rightarrow X; equivalently: X is epimorphic image of a direct sum of copies of the G_{i}). In such a category, every object is the sum of its finitely generated subobjects. Every category {\\\\cal A} = \\\\operatorname{Mod}(R) is locally finitely generated. An object X in a Grothendieck category is called finitely presented if it is finitely generated and if every epimorphism W\\\\to X with finitely generated domain W has a finitely generated kernel. Again, this generalizes the notion of finitely presented modules. If U\\\\subseteq X and both U and X/U are finitely presented, then so is X. In a locally finitely generated Grothendieck category {\\\\cal A}, the finitely presented objects can be characterized as follows:Stenstr√∂m, Prop. V.3.4 X in {\\\\cal A} is finitely presented if, and only if, for every directed system (A_i) in {\\\\cal A}, the natural morphism \\\\varinjlim \\\\mathrm{Hom}(X,A_i)\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Hom}(X,\\\\varinjlim A_i) is an isomorphism. An object X in a Grothendieck category {\\\\cal A} is called coherent if it is finitely presented and if each of its finitely generated subobjects is also finitely presented. (This generalizes the notion of coherent sheaves on a ringed space.) The full subcategory of all coherent objects in {\\\\cal A} is abelian and the inclusion functor is exact. An object X in a Grothendieck category is called Noetherian if the set of its subobjects satisfies the ascending chain condition, i.e. if every sequence X_1\\\\subseteq X_2 \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots of subobjects of X eventually becomes stationary. This is the case if and only if every subobject of X is finitely generated. (In the case {\\\\cal A} = \\\\operatorname{Mod}(R), this notion is equivalent to the familiar notion of Noetherian modules.) A Grothendieck category is called locally Noetherian if it has a set of Noetherian generators; an example is the category of left modules over a left-Noetherian ring.

It was sparked by the self-immolation of a 19-year-old student named Romas Kalanta and prohibition in taking part in Kalanta‚Äôs funeral by officials. As a result, thousands of young demonstrators gathered in the central street of Kaunas, Laisvƒós Alƒója in anti-government protests that started on May 18 and was suppressed by the Soviet troops on May 19 .  The wave of protests  On May 14, 1972, a 19-year-old high school student named Romas Kalanta poured three liters of gasoline on himself and set himself on fire in the square adjoining the Laisvƒós Alƒója in front of the Kaunas Musical Theatre where, in 1940, the People's Seimas had declared the establishment of the Lithuanian SSR. Before the suicide, Kalanta left his notebook with a brief note that read \\"blame only the regime for my death\\". It was only in 1990, when Lithuania declared its independence, that the content of this note became publicly known. Kalanta died fourteen hours later in hospital. On May 18, the Soviet authorities hastened Kalanta's burial by two hours to prevent publicity. However, it provoked even bigger outrage among the gathered people, mostly high school students and young workers, who broke into a politically charged riot, which was forcibly dispersed by KGB, militsiya, and Internal Troops. A spontaneous rally resulted in the disturbance of traffic in the city centre, as well as four shop windows being smashed, five Militsiya officers injured and one Militsiya motorcycle burnt. The next day, about 3,000 people marched along the Laisvƒós Alƒója of which 402 were arrested. The New York Times reported numerous injuries and one death among Soviet troops. Of the arrested, over half were under 20 years old and about a quarter belonged to the youth branch of the Communist Party. To avoid further politicizing, the arrested people were charged with hooliganism. 50 people faced civil charges, while ten faced criminal persecution. Eventually, eight people were sentenced to one to two years in prison. Demonstrations spread to other cities as well, where 108 people were arrested. Mass demonstrations, that had not been present since 1956, were ultimately suppressed by big squads of KGB, Militsiya and Internal Troops.  Aftermath  The public agitation was felt throughout 1972 and 1973 as the KGB registered 3‚Äì4 times more various anti-Soviet incidents. Lithuania recorded 13 other suicides by fire in 1972, including 24-year-old V. Stonys in Varƒóna on May 29, 60-year-old A. Andriu≈°keviƒçius in Kaunas on June 3, 62-year- old Zali≈°auskas on June 10, 40-year-old Juozapas Baraceviƒçius in ≈†iauliai on June 22. The crackdown on the demonstrations was followed by stricter censorship, youth organisations and gatherings came under more thorough surveillance. Lithuanian SSR officials blamed \\"so-called followers of the hippie movement\\" for organising the riots. There were some rallies by the Lithuanian diaspora in other countries, such as the United States, in support. A political √©migr√© Vytautas Alantas published a book dedicated to the events under the title Romas Kalanta: The Living Torches in the Nemunas Valley.Supplement to a Lithuanian Bibliography  The remembrance of events  A monument for Romas Kalanta at the place where he set himself on fire. The day when Romas Kalanta died and the subsequent demonstrations are called \\"kalantinƒós\\" and is observed annually in Kaunas.

In December 2018, Southwick was appointed the Shadow Minister for Police, Shadow Minister for Community Safety, and Shadow Minister for Corrections. He is a member of the Liberal Party. Early life Southwick was born and raised in Caulfield and completed his high school certificate at Mount Scopus Memorial College. He studied for a Bachelor of Business at Victoria University. In 1991 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship in recognition of his service on the University Council. Business career While at university Southwick started his business career including being founding and serving as managing director of The Body Collection. In this business, he employed 50 staff. Southwick has also been the director or managing director of The Market Stars Group, ICE Events Pty Ltd and David James Investments Pty Ltd. Political career Southwick was the Liberal candidate for the Division of Melbourne Ports in the 2004 federal election, achieving a swing of almost 2 points against the incumbent MP Michael Danby. In the 2006 state election he was a Liberal candidate for the Southern Metropolitan Region, narrowly missing out on being elected. He was elected in 2010 as the Member for Caulfield and delivered his first speech on 8 February 2011. He is also Chair of the Parliament's Education and Training Committee and one of the Parliament's inaugural representatives on the board of the Victorian Responsible Gaming Foundation (VRGF). In November 2012, it was revealed that Southwick had misleading personal information on his website. He claimed to have been an 'Adjunct Professor' at RMIT, and that he had a graduate diploma in marketing from Monash University, despite being a few units short. Both universities stated that Southwick had never obtained the qualifications referred to. The information was subsequently removed from his website. Southwick responded to the claims by saying that 'Adjunct Professor' was a title used to refer to him while undertaking teaching overseas on behalf of the RMIT Graduate School of Business in Hong Kong, when he was an Adjunct Lecturer.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/liberal-mp-david-southwick- defends-false-qualifications-in-official- biography/story-e6frf7kx-1226517696924 During July 2013, in a first for Victorian members of parliament, Southwick launched David Southwick.TV. The purpose of the website was to provide video updates to Caulfield residents about local events and issues in Victorian politics. At the time Southwick said: \\"As a fan of technology and emerging new media I have established this website so that local residents can access up to date and engaging video content including what is going on in their own neighbourhood. This content is delivered in a way that the viewer can watch in their own time as if they are part of the action\\"  Policy positions  In 2015, Southwick was one of 13 MLAs who voted against banning anti-abortion campaigners from protesting outside abortion clinics. This vote was a conscience vote that a majority of Liberal members supported. Southwick has been critical of the Victorian education department for allowing repeated anti-Semitic bullying following an incident at a school in Melbourne where students and teachers refused to acknowledge Israeli heritage and demanding the students remove their kippah. jwire.com.au/antisemitic-bullying-mps-say-enough-is-enough/. Southwick has also accused the Victorian Department of education for ‚Äúsystemic failings‚Ä¶ that has enabled repeated cases of anti-Semitic bullying to occur‚Äù https://www.jwire.com.au/antisemitic-bullying-mps-say-enough-is-enough/ Prior to the 2018 election, Southwick expressed his opposition to Safe Schools, the aim of which is to stop bullying towards LGBT students. Southwick has objected to aggressive renewable energy targets, and promised to stop Labor's target. In the vote to legalise voluntary assisted dying, which was a conscience vote, Southwick voted against the legislation. Southwick, who is of the Jewish faith, has been targeted by Aleph Melbourne, a Jewish LGBT group for his opposition to legislation to assist them.

The structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on June 10, 2009.Edson Beall, National Register of Historic Place Listings, National Park Service, June 19, 2009, Accessed December 14, 2010. The building was noted for its design, which was a harbinger for the transition from Classical architecture to the Art Deco/Moderne among commercial buildings in downtown Saint Paul; originally designed in a conservative style, the building became more Moderne as it was being built. Structure The Minnesota Building is a thirteen-story office tower located on the corner of East 4th Street and Cedar Street in downtown St. Paul. It is built of reinforced concrete and has a polished Indiana Limestone facing. The structure's primary facades face the streets to the north and west, and have entrance bays flanked by commercial display window bays at the pedestrial level and vertical window shafts separated by limestone piers between the second and thirteenth stories.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, National Park Service, December 31, 2008; copy accessed from Minnesota Building file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. At the pedestrian level, the East Fourth Street facade is symmetrical with the main building entrance flanked by display window bays and tall pedestrian openings on the outer corners. On the Cedar Street side the building's secondary entrance is flanked by three display window bays to either side. On both primary facades the base is sheathed with polished pink and gray marble. Directly above each bay opening is a narrow band of decorative, colored tile. The main entrance is recessed and displays two sets of brass plated doors flanked by wrought iron and glass display cases. Above the doors and cases is a band of cresting with a center metal plaque reading \\"MINNESOTA BUILDING\\". Above the cresting are five large transom windows, with the building address \\"46\\" painted in gold on the center window. The top of the entry recess is framed with decorative cream-colored terra cotta, which continues along the ceiling. In addition, the entrance has two large brass wall lanterns and, above the entrance, is a low-relief stone version of the Seal of Minnesota, flanked by two stylized eagles facing inward. The secondary entrance is similar to the main entrance, except the bay opening is not as tall and has only a short horizontal transom above the entry doors along with smaller wall lanterns. The tall pedestrian openings are crowned with terra cotta scrollwork. The opening facing the street corner also has a recessed corner shop entry. The two entrances are further defined by side piers and two piers directly above which are decorated with raised stone shafts stepping and terminating with floral motifs halfway up the third story. An ornate terra cotta belt separates the second and third stories. Simple raised edge banding occurs in stone between the eleventh and twelfth stories. The building has no cornice; it was one of the first buildings in the area to dispense with them. Above the twelfth story, the attic story, is a blind frieze of checkered stonework, terminating in a toothy crown formed by the rise of the piers above the parapet in stepped, zigzag finials. The spandrels between the buildings windows were cast in a geometric pattern and set flush with the piers, spreading the checkered motif downward across the entire facade. The building originally had double hung windows on the upper floors, however they were replaced in 1974 with metal-clad windows. The secondary facades, facing east and south internally in the block, are defined by similar window placement, but with concrete floor banding between floors and common brick infill between windows; these facades also display \\"MINNESOTA BLDG.\\" painted in large block letters between the twelfth and thirteenth window rows. The windows on the upper floors of the southern facade were altered in the latter quarter of the twentieth century to improve views of the Mississippi River. The building has a flat composition roof and an iron fire-escape on the southern facade. It is connected to the Saint Paul Skyway System through an adjacent building. The building was originally constructed with twelve stories, the thirteenth story was begun a soon as the building was completed in 1929 and completed in 1930. The thirteenth story is sheathed in the same limestone and repeats the window pattern; the new roof did not feature the same toothy crown that was integrated into the facade of the thirteenth story. History The state capital, St. Paul was most prosperous during the late 1800s and early 1900s, much of its downtown development occurred during that period. Construction in downtown St. Paul was slow in the early 1920s. Several significant buildings were constructed in the previous decade, though all commercial and public buildings relied heavily on the classical style, such as the St. Paul Public Library (1917) and Hamm Building (1919). After the Hamm Building, no multistory office building was built in St. Paul until the Minnesota Building, itself the first high rise building in the city since World War I. The Minnesota Building was the idea of a consortium of developers interested in creating a higher business density in downtown. Lead developers Lincoln Hold and Development Company purchased the first Minnesota Club site in 1928 and razed it to the ground. Designed by St. Paul architect Charles A. Hauser, construction began in 1929 by the Fleisher-Greg Construction Company. Finished on November 1, 1929, the building cost an estimated $970,000, and was designed mainly for office suites for upscale business. The architect moved into the building's additional penthouse floor as soon as it was finished in 1930. The structure has of interior floorspace.Brian Johnson, Historic St. Paul building‚Äôs makeover begins, The Daily Reporter, January 11, 2010, Accessed December 14, 2010. The building's architect, Charles A. Hausler, has several other buildings listed on the NRHP: St. Anthony Park Branch Library, Arlington Hills Library, Riverview Branch Library, also in Ramsey County, Minnesota, as well as the St. Mary's Church Non-Contiguous Historic District in Hague, North Dakota. Born in St. Paul in 1879, he apprenticed in Chicago with Louis Sullivan before returning to Minnesota being licensed in 1908. He was named as St. Paul's first City Architect in 1914 and served for five terms before leaving in 1923 serve eight terms in the Minnesota Senate.Hausler, Charles A., Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, Accessed December 9, 2010. While city architect he drafted the city's first uniform building code in 1921, and designed numerous municipal buildings including the Beaux-Arts Carnegie libraries that were later placed on the NRHP. He returned to private practice while in the Minnesota Senate, and during that time designed the Minnesota Building, which was his largest work. By the late 1990s, the demand for modern office space caused the building to fall out of favor with commercial renters, and it began to fall into disuse.Historical Preservation , Sand Companies, Inc., Accessed December 14, 2010. As early as 2003, plans were proposed to turn the building into a residential building with limited, street level commercial space. It was purchased by Sand Companies in spring 2006, and in January 2010, the developer began construction on converting the building into 137 rental housing units, including some affordable units as well as of commercial and office space Significance The Minnesota Building was the first Art Deco building in downtown St. Paul. Originally designed in a conservative style, the building became more Moderne as it was being built. Its design reflects a transition from Classical architecture to the Art Deco/Moderne design that gained wide popularity in downtown Saint Paul from the late 1920s through early 1940s. The building was followed by a small boom of notable Art Deco buildings in downtown St. Paul, including the Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse, Saint Paul Women's City Club, Salvation Army Headquarters and First National Bank Building.Patricia Murphy and Marie Mingo, National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form, October 13, 1981; copy accessed from Salvation Army Headquarters file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center.

All had 4 MB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which was expandable to 20 MB using proprietary memory modules. There were two processor options: Intel 486SL @ 25 MHz or 33 MHz. The 25-MHz model was available with either a 120-MB or 240-MB IDE hard disk drive, and the 33-MHz model had a 240-MB IDE hard disk drive. Both models had a built in 3.5\\" 1.44-MB floppy disk drive.

Until 2010, the complex was a major place for cultural events in the capital city featuring musical concerts, TV show tapings, balls, high school proms () and dance class graduations (). In 2010 Park kult√∫ry a oddychu became the focus of a public scandal concerning the signing of some contracts in secret by the then-Mayor of Bratislava Andrej ƒéurkovsk√Ω resulting in the public learning about the building being demolished in the future. The buildings contained many artworks both inside and from the outside. The entrance hall contained 28 stained glass windows by national artist Janko Alexy, the floor in the hall was made from unique colored marble from near Luƒçenec, the first floor above contained a monumental painting Do≈æinky by academic painter Franti≈°ek Gajdo≈°. The outside of the main building was decorated with two statues by sculptor Tibor B√°rtfay, above them was a sgraffito decoration.

The functional sculpture is a drinking fountain made of stainless steel in the shape of a tulip tree leaf.Telephone interview with Eric Ernstberger, December 2010 Designed by Eric Ernstberger of Muncie, Indiana, and fabricated by Tarpenning-LaFollette of Indianapolis, Indiana, the sculpture was installed in 1991.Telephone interview with Jan R. Martin, November 2010 Description The sculpture depicts an oversized leaf of the American tulip tree, Indiana's state tree. The sculpture consists of two main segments: the leaf, which forms the main body and majority of the piece, and the petiole-and-bowl segment, which houses the drinking fountain. Measured diagonally from the foremost tips of the leaf segment to the back of the fountain bowl, it is about 207 inches (530 cm) long. The leaf segment is approximately 172 inches (440 cm) at the widest point and rises about 16 inches (41 cm) off the ground at its highest point. It is made from sections of sheeted stainless steel, overlapped and bolted together using brass bolts and acorn nuts, supported by rib-like structures on the underside, and curled to mimic the organic shape of a leaf. It is completed by a long piece of stainless steel which forms the midrib of the leaf. The entire leaf segment is held slightly off the ground on support bars of varying length. A series of small electric lights is arranged under it in order to produce a glow from underneath at night. The petiole-and-bowl segment stands independently of the leaf section, but is positioned to give the impression that the midrib continues into the petiole. It rises approximately 42 inches (110 cm) off the ground, not including the water spigot. The stainless steel petiole structure stands atop a small stone base and supports the main bowl structure, which is made of copper. A thick, slightly irregular, oblong ring of limestone forms the lip of the drinking fountain basin. The spigot itself is an ordinary manufactured fixture; it is attached to the central copper portion of the bowl. Location history An example of site-specific art, the tulip tree leaf is the main focal point of a below-ground-level rectangular courtyard surrounded by the Indiana Government Center South‚Äôs architecture. The courtyard is accessible via an ornamental stairway on the north end, as well as by a set of entrance doors on the south end. The piece itself is located on the south end of the courtyard. Historical information Installed in 1991, the piece was conceptualized and designed by Eric Ernstberger of Rundell Ernstberger Associates, an urban design and landscape architecture firm based in Muncie, Indiana. It was fabricated under the direction of Jan R. Martin of Tarpenning-LaFollette, a custom sheet metal products contractor based in Indianapolis.

The building was the first of two railroad stations constructed in the town of New Paltz, and it is the only former Wallkill Valley Railroad station standing at its original location. After a lengthy public debate over whether to place the station to the east or west of the Wallkill River, it was built in 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz. The rail line was formally opened during a large ceremony on December 20, 1870. A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the Mohonk Mountain House by many vacationers, including two U.S. presidents. In the late 19th century, over a dozen stagecoaches ran between the station and Mohonk daily. The station burned down in 1907 and was rebuilt later that year. The rise of the automobile caused the railroad to end passenger service in 1937; by 1959 the station was completely closed and sold off. After closure, it was used for a variety of businesses, including serving as a public-access television station. Freight service along the Wallkill Valley line continued until 1977, when the corridor was shut to regular rail traffic. The building was in such a state of disrepair by the 1980s that it was almost demolished, and the nearby tracks were torn up and sold for scrap by 1984. However, the station avoided demolition and was renovated in 1988. It was used as a real estate office, and the rail corridor itself was formally opened five years later as the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. In 1999, the station became an Italian restaurant and received its previous name, La Stazione. The building was expanded in 2003 and served as the setting for a scene in a 2008 mob film.  Planning and construction  This 1875 map shows the newly built rail depot in the village, east of the Wallkill River. In February 1864, plans were in place to extend the route of the proposed Wallkill Valley Railroad between the towns of Shawangunk and New Paltz. A civil engineering survey to determine a possible route and cost of such an endeavor was undertaken in March of that year. The proposal sparked a controversy as to whether the route would run east or west of the Wallkill River in New Paltz. The western route was roughly shorter, and the eastern route would cost $25,000 more. However, it was felt that the increased economic activity from having the rail line run east of the river, and directly through the village of New Paltz, would offset the expense. Bonding for the rail line through New Paltz, at a cost of $123,000, was completed by January 1869. The Wallkill Valley Railroad was the first rail line in Ulster County, and was heralded as a cure for the region's isolation from the rest of the industrialized world. Montgomery to Kingston. By November 1869, the Gardiner rail depot, to the south of New Paltz, was ceremoniously opened by the railroad's president, Floyd McKinstry. The station immediately began to see regular traffic. A second Gardiner station was constructed in the hamlet of Forest Glen, in the northern part of Gardiner. The railroad company was contractually obligated to start construction in New Paltz by May 18, 1870, and work on the New Paltz station commenced that day. The depot was designed to be . The design included freight and baggage rooms, as well as a water tank and engine house. The station had two waiting rooms, while most stations on the Wallkill line only had one. The New Paltz station, as with the other Wallkill Valley stations, was based on \\"standard patterns ... rather than by individual architects\\". Half the station's lumber came from Honesdale, Pennsylvania, via the Delaware and Hudson Canal and its framework was raised on July 1, 1870. Work was completed by September 1870. John C. Deyo had provided the carpentry, Snyder and Fuller painted it, and John C. Shaffer was the contractor. Shaffer had also constructed living quarters for the railroad's workers. The masonry for a bridge over the Plattekill Creek between Gardiner and New Paltz was completed by late June 1870, and trestle work was done by July. Beginning in late September 1870, the railroad had begun laying tracks between Gardiner and New Paltz. The tracks reached the Plattekill Creek bridge by the end of October, and the rail line reached New Paltz on December 1, 1870.  Opening and early operation  The station as it appeared when it was originally built The rail line was officially opened in New Paltz on December 20, 1870, during a day-long celebration. At that time, the Wallkill Valley line was connected to the Erie Railroad's Montgomery‚ÄìGoshen branch to the south; an inaugural train containing about 350 passengers ran to Goshen, making stops at each station along the way, before heading back to New Paltz. The station's telegraph was used to \\"receive ... election returns\\" throughout the 1870s. On March 3, 1880, four men robbed the station's safe. They broke into the depot late at night and dragged the safe to the center of the station. They then attempted to drill holes into the safe and explode it with gunpowder, but failing that, cut off one of its sides. The contents of the safe were 300 cigars and a few bills and papers. After the suspects were arrested in Poughkeepsie, the local sheriff was reluctant to transfer the suspects to New Paltz. The Poughkeepsie police were insistent that they be paid immediately for their services. The day after their arrest, the men were allowed to go to a barber shop for a shave; some witnesses were unable to identify the suspects because of this, and the officers were publicly chided for incompetence. Cigars in the suspects' pockets were identical to the cigars in the safe, and along with tools recovered from the site, they were used to identify the men. The suspects were brought to a jail in Kingston pending the ruling of a grand jury that April. A large crowd gathered at the New Paltz depot to watch them depart. The men were described as \\"cracksmen of the first water\\", possibly \\"stylish\\", and so proficient at safe-cracking that, \\"if they any chance at all, or hold of any weapon, they pick their way thro' the jail as easily as boring through a lime heap\\". The men were subsequently convicted. As a result of the burglary, station agent Dwight Marsh was given a revolver, and it became policy not to keep valuables in the safe overnight. On December 8, 1880, another thief broke a window at the depot and stole a box of cigars. Two sheds had been built adjacent to the station by 1881. The land the sheds were built on was purchased the previous year by Mohonk Mountain House co- founder Albert Smiley for $500. The sheds were built for the resort's horses. During this period, as many as 14 stagecoaches each day transported guests between the station and Mohonk. The West Shore Railroad purchased the Wallkill Valley line in June 1881, and placed an additional siding by the depot in 1887 to allow daily \\"special extra-fare trains ... for the Minnewaska and Mohonk visitors\\". President Chester A. Arthur visited the station with his daughter in 1884. He was welcomed by the railroad's director and brought to Lake Mohonk. President Rutherford B. Hayes occasionally attended conferences at the Mohonk Mountain House. In 1892, several townspeople held a reception for him at the station, giving him \\"three rousing cheers\\". Other notable Mountain House guests who arrived by train were opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink and orator William Jennings Bryan. A sewage line was installed from the station to the Wallkill River in 1905.  Springtown station  The former railroad bridge that carried the rail line over the Wallkill River to Springtown is now a public walkway. As soon as the station in the village was completed, a second station was built at Springtown, a hamlet in the northwestern part of the town of New Paltz that once sported \\"its own post office, church, school, hotel, a gambling den ... and a bevy of bars\\". The station was planned to be two stories tall with an area of . A bridge across the Wallkill River to Springtown was completed by December 1870, and the station was constructed at the point where the rail line crossed Coffey Road. Throughout its history, the Springtown station was occupied by various tenants who took up residence. The original New Paltz station burned down around 4:45 A.M. on April 23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire originated in the office stove, and spread rapidly before local fire companies could arrive. A passenger car was used as a temporary station while the building was rebuilt. By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December 31, 1907, and in active use by February 7, 1908. While the original station had a gabled roof, the rebuilt station was hipped. The direction of the new station's battens was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot. The building was not fully rebuilt until 1911. A house was constructed at the site of the Springtown depot the year before it was rebuilt. The New York Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency founded in 1907, ruled in May 1911 that the new Springtown station was adequate. The Springtown station had no station agent or freight house. In 1925, sparks shooting off a passing train caused a fire in Springtown that burned down six buildings, causing $7,000 in damage. The prominence of the New Paltz station, as well as the growth of SUNY New Paltz in the village, caused the decline of Springtown as a community.  Closure  The former station after its closure, being renovated by Robert Mark Realty in 1988 Passenger service along the Wallkill Valley line ceased in 1937, due to the increased usage of automobiles. By December 1958 the building (then owned by the New York Central Railroad) was no longer used as a railroad station. It was sold off in 1959, and hosted a number of local endeavors, serving as a chapter house for the Knights of Columbus and as an office for a public-access television station. Under the ownership of the television station, the roof and floorboards were repaired. In April 1977, the owner of the property, Fetner and Gold Associates, attempted to open the building as a bar. Their zoning permit was rejected; the village mayor was \\"unalterably opposed\\" to the prospect, and the board believed the proposed bar would lead to complaints from nearby apartments. It was also believed that it would be unsafe to open a bar adjacent to an active rail line, and that such a venture would threaten the nearby Huguenot Street Historic District. On December 31, 1977, all regular freight service ceased along the Wallkill Valley line. By the early 1980s the depot had become a \\"hangout for youths to drink and carouse\\" and the village considered dismantling it. Conrail, at that time the owner of the rail line, removed all tracks along the corridor between 1983 and 1984 and salvaged the steel.  Renovation  The Station being expanded in 2003 Robert Mark Realty bought the former station in 1986 and renovated it at a cost of $175,000. Work began in October 1987 and was more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the architect who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as the contractor. The building's design follows a Shingle Style architecture and its sidings are both shingle and clapboard. There are bay windows on the east and west faces, and rafters are partly visible. The building served as a real estate office. On February 9, 1999, the village approved a plan to allow the building to open as a 36-seat Italian restaurant under the co-ownership of two men, Jeff DiMarco and Rocco Panetta. It was at this time the station was given its former name, La Stazione. DiMarco had previously managed construction for an adjacent restaurant, the Gilded Otter. He sold his ownership of The Station in August 2000. The building as viewed from the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail The building is adjacent to a rail trail, and there is a bike rack by the building's northern end. The village of New Paltz purchased its section of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor from Conrail in 1991, formally opening it on October 9, 1993 as a public walkway, the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. The permit allowing The Station to operate as a restaurant also required the placement of a sign in the building's parking lot to indicate the presence of the trail. The village allowed The Station to place a public picnic table under an overhang by the rail trail, on the condition that the restaurant did not provide outdoor food service. In August 1999, the restaurant was forced to remove a gas tank and gas line that were placed under the trail; failure to do so could have resulted in the revocation of The Station's certificate of occupancy, preventing the building from being operated as a restaurant. In 2001, the village was experiencing water drainage issues in the area by the restaurant. By early 2002, the village approved plans for an expansion of The Station, which addressed the drainage issues; the restaurant offered to install larger pipes than were necessary in exchange for the village \\"defray their costs\\". When the Gardiner station burned down on October 10, 2002, The Station was left as the last former station of the Wallkill Valley Railroad remaining at its original location. The building's addition was completed in 2003. A scene from the 2008 mob film Front Man was filmed at The Station; the film's director, Ray Genadry, is the cousin of the restaurant's owner, Rocco Panetta. The scene featured Chris Colombo, son of the late Joseph Colombo, a former boss of the Colombo crime family. Colombo had previously starred in a 2005 mobster documentary on HBO. The building was added to the New Paltz Downtown Historic District on July 24, 2009.

The mall opened in 1969 and, after losing most of its stores in the 2000s, became a dead mall. The mall's interior was closed in December 2011 and demolished in March 2014. History The DeBartolo Corporation built Woodville Mall in 1969. A portion opened in April of that year, and the rest of the mall opened by year's end. At the time of opening, it had three anchor stores: JCPenney, Sears and Lasalle's. Within two years, a new shopping mall on the northwest side of Toledo, the Franklin Park Mall (1971) began competing with Woodville Mall, taking away its status as Toledo's sole enclosed shopping mall. A Woolco store (later Hills and Ames) also opened across from Woodville Mall in 1971. R.H. Macy & Co., which had owned Lasalle's since 1923,http://www.macysinc.com/aboutus/history/macysahistory.aspx?Print converted their local stores to the Macy's name in 1982, and sold the locations to Elder-Beerman two years later. The Woodville Mall underwent a renovation in 1986, removing the center fountain area, adding a new center court area adding skylights, new carpeting, a food court and making the mall more \\"kid friendly\\". JCPenney closed its store in June 1987 due to declining sales. The store was replaced with a general-merchandise store called The Andersons, which opened on September 1, 1988. After The Andersons opened, many mall merchants reported higher sales, including Spencer Gifts, Kay-Bee Toys and Orange Julius. F.W. Woolworth Company, also an original tenant of the mall, closed in February 1994 along with three other Woolworth stores in the Toledo area. After this store closed, JCPenney negotiated opening a new store in the space vacated by Woolworth. Woolworth also operated a restaurant adjacent to the store called the Harvest House Cafeteria from the time of the mall opening until 1994. 1990s and 2000s decline Simon Property Group, which merged with DeBartolo in 1996, put Woodville Mall and another mall in Toledo, North Towne Square, up for sale in 1999. Both properties were sold in 2004 to Sammy Kahen and Jack Kashani of California. Most of the mall's inline stores closed in the 2000s; by 2006, fewer than 30 of the mall's 100 spaces were operational. At this point, the mall's owners considered tearing down portions of the mall. Kahen and Kashani's plans for renovation never materialized, leading to the closure of the Elder-Beerman store and movie theater in late 2009. Mike Kohan, a New York real estate investor, bought the mall from Kahen in November 2009 and announced plans to add stores. New stores opened at the mall in 2011, including a sandwich stop, a furniture store and a radio station. Kohan also attempted to sell the mall to Royale Property Management, a New Jersey concern, but the deal failed because it was contingent on the replacement of the structure's roof.http://www.toledoblade.com/business/2011/12/12/Woodville-Mall-faces- indefinite-closure.html In December 2011, a county judge ordered the mall closed due to structural issues.http://www.toledoblade.com/business/2011/12/16/Judge-orders-closing-of- Woodville-Mall.html Among the issues were holes in the roof, water leaking into the mall, a partially failed alarm system, pervasive mold and mildew, and no heat (the mall had not paid the gas bill), forcing some mall tenants to use space heaters ‚Äî a violation of state fire code. The county sought a permanent injunction to keep the mall closed, and the remaining tenants were told to leave by January 6, 2012.http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2011/12/29/Woodville-mall-tenants-get- clear-out-deadline.html Kohan stated he did not have the money to make the necessary repairs. On June 7, 2012, the closure of the mall was made permanent by a judge, as Kohan had failed to appear at a hearing about the state of the mall.http://www.toledoblade.com/Retail/2012/11/20/Andersons-to-exit-Woodville- Mall.html The Andersons and Sears would remain open, but the theater, which has no exterior entrance, was closed. The mall was scheduled to be demolished at the end of 2012, but the owner had not done so; the City of Northwood was unable to obtain the property from the owner as well. In November 2012, The Andersons announced the closure of its Woodville location effective February 2013, leaving Sears as the only anchor. According to The Andersons, the main reason for the closure of the store was the \\"serious deterioration of the [mall] structure\\". The mall was demolished in March 2014,http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2014/03/05/Crews-now-tackling-teardown- of-crumbling-shopping-center.html except for the Sears, whose closure was announced the same month.http://www.13abc.com/story/24985411/employees- woodville-sears-store-to-close References Shopping malls in Ohio Shopping malls established in 1969 Buildings and structures in Wood County, Ohio Demolished shopping malls in the United States Buildings and structures demolished in 2014 Demolished buildings and structures in Ohio 1969 establishments in Ohio 2011 disestablishments in Ohio ","title":"Woodville Mall"},{"id":"30052139","text":"Daniel Sengewald (born 16 December 1975 in Jena, East Germany) is a retired German professional football player.

S. Gilbert. It was produced at the opening of the new Charing Cross Theatre on 19 June 1869 and ran until September of that year. The work was the last of five such burlesques that Gilbert wrote in the late 1860s. As in his other operatic burlesques, he chose a selection of operatic and popular tunes and wrote new words to fit them. The plot of the piece was loosely based on Vincenzo Bellini's 1831 opera Norma, with dialogue in rhyming couplets full of complicated word-play and dreadful puns. Burlesques of this period featured actresses en travesti in tights or in dresses as short as possible without provoking the legal authorities. Gilbert later turned against this practice, and in his Savoy Operas no characters were played by members of the opposite sex. History Gilbert's four earlier operatic burlesques, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866), La Vivandi√®re; or, True to the Corps! (1867), The Merry Zingara; or, the Tipsy Gipsy and the Pipsy Wipsy (1868) and Robert the Devil, or The Nun, the Dun, and the Son of a Gun (1868) had parodied comic or romantic operas.Stedman, pp. 34‚Äì62 The critic of The Morning Post had asserted that parodying comic opera was a much more difficult undertaking than parodying tragic opera, and instanced Norma as \\"an eminently tragic work\\", far easier to burlesque.\\"Queen's Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 23 January 1868, p. 5 Gilbert and his wife, Lucy, in 1867 The work was written for the opening of the new Charing Cross Theatre. It was the last of three pieces on the bill, following a short operetta, Coming of Age, and the main item of the evening, a three-act drama, Edendale, about families split by the American Civil War.\\"Charing Cross Theatre\\", The Era, 27 June 1867, p. 14 The part of Norma was taken by Mary Frances Hughes, well known on the London stage since her debut in November 1853.\\"First Appearances in London of Actors and Actresses\\", Era Almanack, January 1870, p. 22 The hero, Pollio (a tenor in Bellini's original), was played as a breeches role by Cecily Nott, another favourite, who had made her debut in 1851, aged 18 or 19, a prot√©g√©e of Louis Antoine Jullien.\\"Cicely Nott\\", Musical World, 13 December 1851, p. 785 The ing√©nue role of the novice Adalgisa was played by Kathleen Irwin, who had made her London debut earlier the same evening, in Edendale. On the opening night, 19 June 1869, the performance started late because of noisy protests from patrons in the cheap standing area, the pit, about the lack of programmes. Gilbert's burlesque did not begin until after 11:00 p.m. The theatrical paper The Era reported, \\"Although it was nearly half an hour after midnight before the curtain fell, the jokes rattled rapidly off through continuous laughter, and Mr. Gilbert was summoned at the end to receive the congratulations of the house.\\" The Pretty Druidess was the last of a series of about a dozen early comic stage works by Gilbert, including operatic burlesques, pantomimes and farces. These were full of awful puns and jokes as was traditional in similar pieces of the period.Stedman, pp. 30‚Äì62 Nevertheless, Gilbert's burlesques were considered unusually tasteful compared to the others on the London stage.Crowther, Andrew. The Life of W. S. Gilbert . The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive Gilbert's early pokes at grand opera show signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of his work. He would depart even further from the burlesque style from about 1869 with plays containing original plots and fewer puns.The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, Volume XIII, Chapter VIII, Section 15, (1907‚Äì21) (referring to Pygmalion and Galatea, The Cambridge History states: \\"The satire is shrewd, but not profound; the young author is apt to sneer, and he has by no means learned to make the best use of his curiously logical fancy. That he occasionally degrades high and beautiful themes is not surprising. To do so had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it; but Gilbert's is not the then usual hearty cockney vulgarity.\\" The success of these 1860s pieces encouraged Gilbert in his playwriting and led to his next phase, which included more mature \\"fairy comedies\\", such as The Palace of Truth (1870) and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871), and his German Reed Entertainments, which in turn led to the famous Gilbert and Sullivan operas.Crowther, Contradiction Contradicted, pp. 20‚Äì23 Cast As printed in the published libretto: *Norma (Mother Superior of the Pretty Druidess) ‚Äì Miss Hughes *Pollio (a Roman Pro-Consul) ‚Äì Cicely Nott *Adalgisa (a Novice) ‚Äì Kathleen Irwin *Oroveso (Druidic High Priest ‚Äì father of Norma) ‚Äì Mr. R.

The younger druidesses are not keen to see the dashing and handsome Romans driven out, but their Mother Superior, Norma, is adamant. Orovesto reproaches them for their indulgence and holds Pollio up as an example of how irritating the Romans can be. Norma enters and further encourages anti-Roman sentiments, while privately lamenting that driving them out would deprive her of her husband, Pollio, whom she has secretly married. Everyone leaves. Pollio and Flavius enter surreptitiously, planning to spy on the druidess's secret rites. Pollio, though married to Norma, is smitten by Adalgisa. Hearing Norma's procession about to enter, Pollio cries out for help and alleges that Flavius has profaned the sanctum by embracing Adalgisa. Norma condemns Flavius to death. Scene II ‚Äì Norma's Home Oroveso reflects that he has adopted so many personas over the years that he now longer knows who he really is. Norma and Pollio meet, and she discovers that he no longer loves her. Adalgisa begs Norma to release her from her vows because she is in love with a Roman. When Norma realises that the Roman in question is Pollio both she and Adalgisa turn on him and berate him as he attempts to defend himself. Scene III ‚Äì The Temple of Irminsul, prepared for a Fancy Fair The fund-raising event is in full swing. The junior druidesses make rude remarks about each other's contributions. Oroveso tries to raffle fake autographs, which he has forged, of celebrities of various anachronistic eras, up to the nineteenth century. Flavius is led out to be burnt at the stake. Norma announces that she too has sinned, by marrying Pollio, and must also be executed. Oroveso is outraged that she has married a Roman and clamours for her immediate death. The other druidesses at once confess that they have all married Romans secretly.This plot point would be repeated in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe (1883). Oroveso's lost visiting-card case is found, and he discovers that he is, in fact, Julius Caesar. He decrees that although the druid law prescribes fire as the punishment for all the druidesses and their spouses, \\"red fire\\" ‚Äì a theatrical lighting effect ‚Äì will suffice. The red lighting is shone on the cast and all ends happily. Norma addresses the audience with a plea for indulgence: > :So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes; :Forgive the jokes you've > heard five thousand times; :Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog, > :Our low-bred songs ‚Äì our slangy dialogue; :And, above all ‚Äì oh, ye with > double barrel ‚Äì :Forgive the scantiness of our apparel!

The Gilbert scholar Jane Stedman comments that the magazine Judy had embarked on an anti-Gilbert campaign (Gilbert wrote for Judy's rival, Fun magazine),Stedman, pp. 71‚Äì72 and denigrated Gilbert's unusually refined libretto by praising a contemporary one by F. C. Burnand at its expense.\\"A phenomenon! ‚Ä¶ Burnand has given us a comic burlesque\\". Judy, 1 September 1869, p. 189 By contrast, The Era wrote: > The story is perverted with great ingenuity, the lines are as remarkable for > correctness of rhythm as for their abundance of puns, and the parodies are > written with unusual care to some of the prettiest melodies in the operatic > and lyrical repertory. Miss Hughes, who sings with admirable skill and taste > a grand scena, is excellent as the High Priestess Norma; and Miss Kathleen > Irwin completed her triumph of the night by revealing herself as an > accomplished vocalist no less than a pleasing actress as the fair Adalgisa. > ‚Ä¶ Mr R.

It follows the story of narrator Sydney Sage, the alchemist who helped Rose in Blood Promise, Spirit Bound and Last Sacrifice.'Vampire Academy' Breaking News: Spin-Off Series Coming Soon! The book was released on August 23, 2011. Plot After helping rogue Dhampir Rose Hathaway evade justice, Sydney Sage's situation with the Alchemists is shaky at best. Her career is jeopardized to the point where she may have to undergo re-education. Woken in the middle of the night, Sydney is given a last chance: to pose as the older sister of Jill Dragomir ( illegitimate sister of Vasilisa Dragomir ) at a boarding school in Palm Springs California and assists Keith the alchemist whom she hates and also studied with Sydney's father to conceal her identity to those who oppose Vasilisa. This is because of the family quorum law which means that if Jill were to die Vasilisa would have no family left and would have to abdicate the throne. This is all set in motion due to an attack on Jill which was violent and brutal. Sydney, Jill, Eddie Castile, and Adrian head off to Palm Springs. Sydney and Jill room together while Eddie rooms with Micah which is later said to remind Eddie of his dead best friend Mason from St. Vladimir's Academy. On the first day of school, Jill is sent back to her dorm room accused of having a hangover in the morning. While Sydney visits Adrian in the afternoon, he reveals that he and Jill are bonded from the attack which actually killed Jill, but Adrian, being a spirit user, brought her back from the dead - she is now shadow kissed. This is why she always knows what Adrian is thinking and why she feels hungover every morning. As time goes on, Sydney is excelling in school while Jill is seen to have few friends and is continuously picked on by Laurel due to her crush on Micah, as he shows an interest in Jill. When meeting with an older Moroi - Clarence, who is housing Adrian, Jill starts to fall for the Moroi's 19-year-old son Lee. Lee takes the whole squad mini-golfing and Jill uses her water magic much to Sydney's disdain, as it freaks her out reminding her of her alchemist training that Moroi are unnatural creatures made from evil. While at school, Sydney starts to get friendly with a boy who helps out in her history class. Trey asks Sydney about the lily tattoo on her cheek, which is the sign of an alchemist. Many in the school have similar tattoos that give them drug-like effects similar to steroids or marijuana. Sydney tells Keith about the alchemist-like tattoos, but Keith brushes it off. After talking to her friends, Sydney discovers that the tattoos are given by a place called Nevermore and she finds vials of Moroi blood and saliva along with copper and silver. When visiting Adrian, Sydney sees a needle sized hole in Clarence's neck and deduces that Keith has been supplying Nevermore. Thus, she has him removed by the Alchemists. Jill is in a fashion show at a local boutique and after the show Adrian and Sydney get into an argument because Sydney has been paying for Adrian to go to college classes without him knowing. Sydney was worried he would drop out before next semester, but seeing as damaging it is to Jill she decides to go to Keith's house and let Lee drop Jill back at school. While clearing out Keith's things, Lee turns up and Sydney discovers that Lee was a strigoi, but he was turned back by a spirit user. This means that he ages slower and may be unable to access his magic. Lee also wishes to be turned back into a strigoi, but is unable to and he's the reason for all of the unknown deaths in Palm Springs including that of his cousin. Adrian show up at Keith's house, but both he and Sydney are restrained and Lee called his strigoi friends using Sydney and Adrian as a bargain for being re-awakened. Once the strigoi turn up and try to change Lee into one of them he instead dies then Sydney, Adrian, and the two strigoi get into a fight. One strigoi goes to drink Sydney's blood, but cannot as it is too vile and tastes horrible, but as they feed on Adrian. Sydney uses a fire charm that she created on a whim of her history teacher Mrs.Terwilliger to distract the strigoi. Just then, Eddie and Jill show up and with the help of Jill's water magic Eddie kills both strigoi. After the encounter, the alchemist offer Sydney Keith's apartment, but knowing Adrian's wishes, she instead asks that Adrian be given the apartment in exchange for his assistance in the research into spirit users and Strigoi and why they cannot be reawakened. Sydney instead requests her own dorm room on campus, allowing her to continue to watch Jill. Back at school, Sydney confronts her teacher about the amulet, and the teacher confesses she had known about vampires all along as well as Alchemists. She believes that Sydney has an innate magical ability, and it was that ability that gave the amulet its power. Abe Mazur, Rose's father, arrives with Jill's new roommate ‚Äì a Dhampir named Angeline who Sydney met while on the run with Rose the previous year. Adrian realizes that Abe has been keeping a close eye on Palm Springs because of Nevermore ‚Äì and that Abe himself is likely trafficking vampire blood as well. Abe, in turn, reveals to Adrian that the reason Sydney had been forced to obey his commands was that Sydney had contracted him for an attack on Keith that left him with a glass eye ‚Äì retribution for Keith's rape of her sister.

He has a PhD in sociology from Duke University. Accomplishments Author or editor of more than 150 scholarly articles and chapters and 18 books, Bean's research focuses on international migration, unauthorized migration, U.S. immigration policy, and the demography of the U.S. Hispanic population. A member of the Council on Foreign Relations, he has been a Guggenheim Fellow and held numerous visiting scholar positions (at the Russell Sage Foundation, the Transatlantic Academy, the American Academy in Berlin, the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University, and the Center for U.S./Mexico Studies at the University of California at San Diego). He has mentored dozens of students, who hold (or have held) positions at such places as Georgetown University, UCLA, the University of Illinois, the University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State University, Princeton University, the University of Washington, the Migration Policy Institute, and the U.S. Bureau of the Census. A frequent recipient of foundation and federal grants, Bean has been a Principal Investigator of NICHD behavioral science grants in population in every decade since the inception of the program in 1969. In 2011, he received the Distinguished Lifetime Scholarly Career Award in International Migration at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. Intellectual Contributions Bean's intellectual contributions span five areas. The first is racial/ethnic fertility. The American Library Association gave a Choice award for academic distinction to his book Mexican American Fertility Patterns (with Gray Swicegood, 1985). This study shows that Mexican-origin women have higher birth rates because of their lower socioeconomic standing and work opportunities, not because of their cultural orientations, and that their fertility changes as they achieve higher levels of education. A second area in which Bean is well-known is Hispanic demography, as indicated by his 1987 book The Hispanic Population of the United States (with Marta Tienda), which was commissioned by the National Committee for Research on the 1980 Census and the Russell Sage Foundation. Regarded as a canonical treatment of its subject, the work provides a comprehensive portrayal of Hispanics and shows, among other things, the crucial importance of considering Hispanic national-origin and nativity groups separately in policy-relevant research. A third research area is unauthorized Mexican migration. He co-directed a large research program at The Urban Institute and Rand Corporation on the implementation and effectiveness of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), legislation that initiated employer penalties for hiring unauthorized workers and permitted legalization of unauthorized immigrants in the country. His research involved developing estimates of how IRCA affected unauthorized migration and what factors affected flows from Mexico.http://www.urban.org/expert.cfm?ID=FrankDBean In the mid-1990s, he led a group of U.S. and Mexican scholars seeking to improve estimates of unauthorized migration for the Mexico/U.S. Binational Migration Study, mandated by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform. The research provided what The New York Times called in a front-page story \\"the first authoritative estimate of the net annual flow of illegal Mexican workers into the United States.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/31/world/us-mexico-study- sees-exaggeration-of-migration-data.html?emc=eta1 This work also helped to spawn adjustments for coverage error in all subsequent official and widely accepted estimates of unauthorized migration. A fourth contribution comes from his study of immigrant incorporation. His book America's Newcomers and the Dynamics of Diversity (with Gillian Stevens) introduced the idea that predominantly lower-skilled labor migrant groups like Mexicans experience delays in (but not blockage of) incorporation, especially when their members arrive as unauthorized entrants. Showing that many incorporation processes for such groups do not substantially emerge until the third generation, the study won the 2003 American Sociological Association's Otis Dudley Duncan award for the best book in social demography. His fifth major contribution emerges from his examination of immigration and race/ethnicity in the United States. An edited research volume, Help or Hindrance? The Economic Implications of Immigration for African Americans (with Daniel Hamermesh), received an ALA Choice award for academic distinction.http://www.cro2.org/default.aspx?page=reviewdisplay&pid;=2299747 Also, his 2010 book, The Diversity Paradox: Immigration and the Color Line in 21st Century American (with Jennifer Lee), on how immigration has increased U.S. ethnoracial diversity and altered notions of racial identity in the United States, was awarded the ASA's 2011 Otis Dudley Duncan award for the best book in social demography. The latter study refutes claims that diversity fosters suspicion and withdrawal and shows instead that immigration-related diversity, more so than black-white diversity, increases intermarriage and leads to the dissolution of ethnoracial color lines, although less so for blacks compared to other groups.

It still faces threats from deer, which can get past the fence, a limited gene pool, and the fact that a single severe event such as a drought, could eliminate the single population. Though rare in the wild, this dudleya is kept in cultivation by gardeners and enthusiasts of succulents, and a cultivar called 'White Sprite' is popular.Dudleya 'White Sprite' This is a compact plant growing from a caudex topped with clumps of leaf rosettes each measuring up to 5 centimeters wide and containing up to 20 small leaves. The fleshy triangular leaves are green, red-tinged, or white with waxy, powdery coating of exudate. Each leaf is up to about 2 centimeters long by 1 wide.

Initially, the mall was to have been an enclosed project, but in 2003, the company decided on building a lifestyle center. Stores that were proposed to open at the mall included Sears, Galyan's, Kaufmann's and Parisian. In October 2007, the mall opened for business with Barnes & Noble, JCPenney and Dillard's, the latter of which moved from two stores at nearby Southwyck Mall, as its anchor stores. Two months later, Showcase Cinemas opened a multiplex theater complex at the mall. Upon opening, the mall included several tenants new to the Toledo market, such as P.F.

Located at Canadian Forces Base Edmonton, the RCA Band provides music designed to support Canadian Forces operations, foster morale and esprit de corps, and promote Canada and the Canadian military nationally and abroad. The band operates mainly in western Canada and is de facto the representative band of the Canadian Army in the western provinces. All unit members are professional musicians in addition to being members of the military, which enables the band to adopt a variety of configurations to suit the musical needs of their audiences. Ensembles can range from jazz combos, rock bands, and chamber groups, through stage and show bands to full marching and concert bands.http://edmontonchambermusic.org/royal_cdn_artillery_band.phphttps://rca- arc.org/the-serving-regiment/rca-band-2/https://yeglive.ca/events/the-royal- canadian-artillery-band/dec-7-2018/winspear-centre History The RCA Band traces its roots to the \\"B\\" Battery Band of the Royal Canadian Artillery in Quebec City. Founded in 1879, it was composed of volunteer militia and professionally trained musicians from the United Kingdom and France, becoming the first permanent military band. It became the Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery Band in 1899 under Joseph V√©zina, a prominent Quebec musician who was also the first director of the Orchestre Symphonique de Qu√©bec and led the first performance of \\"O Canada\\" in 1880. A second band part of the Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery was formed in Kingston in 1905 and directed by Major Alfred Light. During the First World War, the RCGA Band was stationed at the Citadelle of Quebec. During this time, it was mentioned in an article of the Montreal Star as \\"justly known as one of the best bands in North America\\". The two bands were the only ones operational at the end of the war. In 1922, 20 members of the band broke off or created the Band of the Royal 22nd Regiment or La Musique du Royal 22e R√©giment as it is known today in French. During the Second World War, the band was for the most part stationed overseas, one of them being the RCHA Band which was reformed and stationed in Shilo, Manitoba, and then Winnipeg. In 1952, the Royal Canadian Artillery Band was formed in Halifax under Captain E.R. Wragg, and in the following years it travelled overseas to entertain troops in South Korea. In 1955 Captain Kenneth Elloway became the new bandmaster and was vital in highlighting the RCA Band on an international stage. He arranged appearances on BBC radio, invited guest performers, and led the RCA Band in the 1957 Bermuda Tattoo. After the Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968 the RCA Band in Halifax was dissolved and reformed in Montreal. The RCA Band performed for over 100,000 spectators in 1988. The RCA Band was moved from Montreal to Edmonton on 4 December 1997.http://army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/rca-band/history.page Uniform Band of the 15th Field Regiment, an affiliated reserve band with the RCA Band. The RCA's musicians uniforms are based on the officers pattern of the ceremonial uniforms of the now dissolved Royal Artillery Band. RCA musicians, when in full dress uniform, wear the busby (not to be confused with the bearskin cap), with tall plumes attached to ferrule to the top of the front. Unlike the Royal Artillery, the RCA Band wears white plumes, and do not wear the cavalry spurs. Bandsman wear navy blue tunics, quilt lined with a standing collar, fastened with hooks. Navy blue cavalry-style pantaloons are also worn, with an RCA stripe in scarlet sewn onto outside of each leg. Role The role of the Royal Canadian Artillery Band is to provide a comprehensive, professional musical service to 3rd Canadian Division Support Group, 3rd Canadian Division, the Canadian Armed Forces and the government of Canada. Performance history In 1994‚Äì95, the RCA Band participated in the Canada Remembers program, which took the band on a tour of Asia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium. In 2000, the RCA Band was chosen by the Directorate of History and Heritage as the Canadian representative for the Kangwon International Tattoo commemorating the golden jubilee of the start of the Korean War. In 2004, the band participated in a week-long tour of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which was centred on its participation in the Change of Command Ceremony for Brigadier General Stuart A. Beare in Banja Luka. In the summer of that same year, the band performed in the Fortissimo Sunset Ceremony on Parliament Hill with the Band of the Ceremonial Guard and the Albany Marine Band.https://www.albany.marines.mil/News/News-Article- Display/Article/507843/mclb-band-performs-with-canadian-military-bands/ The band travelled to Sweden in 2006, where they performed in Kungstradgarden and Str√§ngn√§s as well as marched in the 20th Swedish Military Tattoo, which included a parade to the Stockholm Palace while performing pieces such as \\"The Voice of the Guns\\" and \\"Glorious Victory\\". In June 2017, the band provided musical support for a contingent of the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, which provided the Queen's Guard in England at Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace, the Tower of London and Windsor Castle. In October‚ÄìNovember 2018, the band provided support for a contingent from the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, which provided the Queen's Guard.

The CO is responsible for the creative direction of the band and all facets of musical performance. The principal components of the band are the following sections: *Brass *Woodwind *Percussion The RCA Band is a 35 piece band that also performs in the following configurations: *Parade Band *Concert Band *Jazz Big Band (10 piece ensemble) *Windage Salon Orchestra *The Soul Orchestra *Jazz Task Force *Chamber groups Woodwind Quintet Brass Quintet Members of the band spend most of their time engaged in training activities when not delivering formal performances. Musical training usually includes up to three hours of individual practice per day and collective practice sessions in groups ranging in size from quartets to full unit rehearsals. Pipes and Drums In 2008, for the first time in its then over 100 years history, Corporal Jim Douglas, who was a piper in the CF, was posted to The RCA Band as part of what is now the RCA Pipes and Drums, which as of 2010, had four members. In November 2012, it appreared in public for the first time to perform at a public concert in support of a charity. Music The RCA Band regularly performs the regimental marches: The British Grenadiers and the Royal Artillery Slow March The Royal Artillery Slow March was written by the Duchess of Kent, and mother of Queen Victoria around 1836. The tune of The British Grenadiers was first adopted for use as a regimental march by the Honourable Artillery Company (the oldest British regiment), during the English Civil War. The melody was brought to England by King William III of the Netherlands and soon after became popular in the country and was known as the Royal Artillery Grenadiers March unofficially until 1882. It first appeared in print as 'The British Grenadiers' in 1740. The popularity of the tune 'The British Grenadiers' subsequently led to its adoption by all regiments who wear as their cap or collar badges, the symbol of the grenade. This included the Royal Artillery and as a result is now used by the RCA.

Upon returning to the United States, Moses enrolled in the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where he studied architecture and design. The contemporary art scene of New York proved fascinating to Moses, and he became enthralled with the liveliness of the ever-evolving art world. It was during this time that Moses began painting and drawing in earnest. In the early 1960s, Moses moved to Houston and worked as an architect before traveling further West to California. He lived and worked in San Francisco for a number of years while pursuing his painting career. After another brief stint in Houston, Moses moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1969. Enchanted by the light and landscape, Moses still lives and works in Santa Fe.

Gudenus was a descendant of a Calvinist family which had removed from Utrecht to Hesse. After attending school at Cassel he continued his studies at the University of Marburg, in which city he subsequently acted as deacon of the reformed church. He had held this position for less than two years, when a change of civil rulers resulted in the official substitution of Lutheranism for Calvinism at Marburg. Gudenus lost his office because of his refusal to adopt the Augsburg Confession. He returned to Cassel, was appointed assistant at Abterode, and in 1625 became pastor there. The reading of Bellarmine's works revealed to him the Catholic doctrine in its true light, and after careful study he and his family were received into the Church in 1630. The conversion was made at the cost of considerable personal sacrifices. After a time of need and trials Gudenus was named high bailiff at Treffurt, a position which he held until his death. His funeral panegyric was delivered by Herwig Boning, representative of the Archbishop of Mainz in the district of Eichsfeld and parish priest of Duderstadt. Boning included the panegyric in his edition of the works of Gudenus, which comprised a treatise on the Eucharist and two letters on the history of his conversion, one addressed to the Jesuits of Heiligenstadt, the other to his brother-in-law, Dr. Paul Stein: \\"Mensa Neophyti septem panibus instructa a cl. viro Dno. Mauritio Gudeno, electorali Moguntino praefecto in Trefurt p.m. sive ejusdem de sua ad fidem romano-catholicam conversione et divina erga se providentia narratio\\" (Duderstadt, 1686). Gudenus was survived by five sons, some of whom achieved distinction in ecclesiastical and academic circles. John Daniel became Auxiliary Bishop of Mainz; John Maurice, electoral and imperial counsellor and praetor at Erfurt, wrote a history of that city, \\"Historia Erfurtensis\\" (Duderstadt, 1675); Dr. John Christopher, who was diplomatic representative of the Archdiocese of Mainz at Vienna, and Dr. Urban Ferdinand, who occupied a university chair, became the founders of the two noble branches of the Gudenus family, which still flourish in Austria.

He was born in the Duchy of Brunswick- L√ºneburg. Biography Barthold Nihus was born on 7 February 1590 at Holtorfe at Hanover in a poor Lutheran Protestant family. He received his primary education at Verdun and Goslar, and in 1607 he studied philosophy and medicine at the University of Helmstedt. After obtaining a master's degree in philosophy in 1612 Nihus began studying Protestant theology. In 1616, along with two students from aristocratic families moved to the University of Jena. Later, he became a teacher of the princes of Saxony-Weimar Duchy. Inability of Protestant theologians on the major issues of faith caused him to doubt the truth of Protestantism. In 1622, Berthold Niehus moved to Cologne, where he visited the house of proselytes, founded the Brotherhood of the Holy Cross. In the same year he was received into the Catholic Church. After his conversion to Catholicism Niehus sent letters to professors Georg Calixtus and Konrad Hornejus in which he explained his reasons for joining the Catholic Church. The main motive of the treatment was the need for the Chief Justice, which could explain the Bible and put an end to theological debate and controversy, and so the judge in his opinion is the Bishop of Rome. In 1629 he became the abbot of the monastery of Premonstratensian, from which he was expelled, along with the monks, by the Protestants after the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. Berthold was running in Hildesheim, where he became a canon of the Church of the Holy Cross, where later moved to Holland, where he met with Gerhard Vossius. In 1645 was caused by the papal nuncio Fabio Chigi in Munster, where he was to participate in the World Peace of Westphalia. A few years later he moved to Mainz, where he entered the service of the Bishop Johann Philipp von Schonborn, on whose behalf in 1654 went to Ingolstadt to collect information about the institute of diocesan priests, headed by Bartholomew Holzhauser. In 1655 Schoenborn appointed him suffragan bishop of Saxony and Thuringia, with headquarters in Erfurt, where he died on 10 March 1657. Works * Ars nova, dicto S.

He sat in the House of Commons for three years in the 1860s, and two years in the 1880s.  Career  His uncle was Colonel Nathaniel Eckersley, from Laurel House in Hindley, who served with the Duke of Wellington and at the military station established in Manchester after the Peterloo Massacre. In addition to his cotton mills, Eckersley was a partner of the Wigan Old Bank, formerly Thomas Woodock's, Sons and Eckersley, which amalgamated in 1874 with Parr's Banking Company in Warrington. He was Mayor of Wigan in 1853 and in 1873, and was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire in September 1863. In June 1873 he led Wigan's welcome for the Prince and Princess of Wales, who opened a new hospital in the town, which the Princess named the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary.  Parliament  He was elected as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Wigan at a by- election in March 1866, following the resignation of the Conservative MP Hon. James Lindsay. Nominations for the contest took place in the moot hall in Wigan, supervised by the Mayor Thomas Knowles. The candidates then addressed the voters in the town hall. Eckersley offered himself as a \\"free and independent candidate\\", and said that until then he had never considered himself to be a politician. The Mayor called for a show of hands, which he found to be in favour of Eckersley, but a poll was demanded and Eckersley won 411 votes to the 349 cast for his Liberal opponent John Lancaster. He was defeated at by John Lancaster (MP) at the 1868 general election, when Liberal candidates took both seats in Wigan, and he did not stand for Parliament again for another 15 years. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1878, and in that capacity helped to organise a fund for the dependants of the victims of the explosion on 7 June 1878 at the Wood Pit Colliery in Haydock, where more than 200 miners were killed. When Wigan's Conservative MP Lord Lindsay succeeded to his father's peerage in 1880, and Eckersley was asked to stand at the by- election in January 1881, but refused.

The six members of the Moore family and two house guests were found bludgeoned in the Moore residence. All eight victims, including six children, had severe head wounds from an axe. A lengthy investigation yielded several suspects, one of whom was tried twice. The first trial ended in a hung jury and the second ended in an acquittal. The crime remains unsolved. Details An article in The Day Book, Chicago, 14 June 1912, depicting five of the victims and the house. The Moore family consisted of parents Josiah B. (aged 43), Sarah (n√©e Montgomery) (39), and their four children: Herman Montgomery (11), Mary Katherine (10), Arthur Boyd (7), and Paul Vernon (5). An affluent family, the Moores were well known and well liked in their community. On June 9, 1912, Mary Katherine Moore invited Ina Mae (8) and Lena Gertrude Stillinger (12) to spend the night at the Moore residence. That evening, the visiting girls and the Moore family attended the Presbyterian church where they participated in the Children's Day Program, which Sarah had coordinated. After the program ended at 9:30 p.m., the Moores and the Stillinger sisters walked to the Moores' house, arriving between 9:45 and 10p.m. At 7a.m. the next day, June 10, Mary Peckham, the Moores' neighbor, became concerned after she noticed that the family had not come out to do their morning chores. Peckham knocked on the Moores' door. When nobody answered, she tried to open the door and discovered that it was locked. Peckham let the Moores' chickens out and called Ross Moore, Josiah's brother. Like Peckham, Moore received no response when he knocked on the door and shouted. Ross unlocked the front door with his copy of the house key. While Peckham stood on the porch, Ross went into the parlor and opened the guest bedroom door, where he found Ina and Lena Stillinger's bodies on the bed. Moore immediately told Peckham to call Henry \\"Hank\\" Horton, Villisca's primary peace officer, who arrived shortly thereafter. Horton's search of the house revealed that the entire Moore family and the two Stillinger girls had been bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon, an axe belonging to Josiah, was found in the guest room where the Stillinger sisters were found. Doctors concluded that the murders had taken place between midnight and 5a.m. Two spent cigarettes in the attic suggested that the killer or killers patiently waited in the attic until the Moore family and the Stillinger guests were asleep. The killer(s) began in the master bedroom, where Josiah and Sarah Moore were sleeping. Josiah received more blows from the axe than any other victim; his face had been cut to such an extent that his eyes were missing. They used the blade of the axe on Josiah while using the blunt end on the rest of the victims. They proceeded into the children's rooms and bludgeoned Herman, Mary Katherine, Arthur, and Paul in the head in the same manner as their parents. They returned to the master bedroom to inflict more blows on the elder Moores, knocking over a shoe that had filled with blood, before moving downstairs to the guest bedroom and killing Ina and Lena. Investigators believed that all of the victims except for Lena Stillinger had been asleep when murdered. They thought that she was awake and tried to fight back, as she was found lying crosswise on the bed, and with a defensive wound on her arm. Lena's nightgown was pushed up to her waist and she was wearing no undergarments, leading to law enforcement speculation that the killer(s) sexually molested her or attempted to do so. Investigation Over time, many possible suspects emerged, including Reverend George Kelly, Frank F. Jones, William Mansfield, Loving Mitchell and Henry Lee Moore (no relation). George Kelly was tried twice for the murder. The first ended in a hung jury, while the second trial ended in an acquittal. Other suspects in the investigation were also exonerated. Andrew Sawyer Every transient and otherwise unaccounted-for stranger was a suspect in the murders. One such suspect was a man named Andy Sawyer. No real evidence linked Sawyer to the crime, but his name came up often in grand jury testimonies. According to Thomas Dyer of Burlington, Iowa, a bridge foreman and pile driver for the Burlington Railroad, S.A. (Andy) Sawyer approached his crew in Creston at 6:00a.m. on the morning the murders were discovered. Sawyer was clean-shaven and wearing a brown suit when he arrived. His shoes were covered in mud and his pants were wet nearly to the knees. He asked for employment and, as Dyer needed an extra man, he was given a job on the spot. Dyer testified that later that evening when the crew reached Fontanelle, Iowa, Sawyer purchased a newspaper and went off by himself to read it. The newspaper carried a front page account of the Villisca murders and, according to Dyer, Sawyer \\"was much interested in it.\\" Dyer's crew complained that Sawyer slept with his clothes on and was anxious to be by himself. They were also uneasy that Sawyer slept with his axe next to him; he often talked of the Villisca murders and whether or not a killer had been apprehended. He reportedly told Dyer that he had been in Villisca that Sunday night and had heard of the murders. Afraid of being taken as a suspect, he had left and gone to Creston. Dyer was suspicious and turned him over to the sheriff on June 18, 1912. Dyer later testified that prior to the sheriff's arrival, he walked up behind Sawyer. He was rubbing his head with both hands and suddenly jumped up and said to himself, \\"I will cut your god damn heads off.\\" At the same time, he made striking motions with the axe and began hitting the piles in front of him. Dyer's son (J.R.) testified that one day as the crew drove through Villisca, Sawyer told him he would show J.R. where the man who killed the Moore family got out of town. He said the man that did the job jumped over a manure box which he pointed out about 1¬Ω blocks away, and then showed where he crossed the railroad track. J.R. said there were footprints in the soggy ground north of the embankment. Sawyer told J.R. to look on the other side of the car and said he would show him an old tree where the murderer stepped into the creek. According to J.R. Dyer, he looked over and saw such a tree south of the track about four blocks away. Sawyer was dismissed as a suspect in the case when officials learned that he could prove he had been in Osceola, Iowa, on the night of the murders. He had been arrested for vagrancy there, and the Osceola sheriff recalled putting him on a train (to send him away) at approximately 11p.m. that evening. Reverend George Kelly Kelly was an English-born traveling minister in town on the night of the murders. Kelly was described as peculiar, reportedly having suffered a mental breakdown as an adolescent. As an adult, he was accused of peeping and several times asking young women and girls to pose nude for him. On June 8, 1912, he came to Villisca to teach at the Children's Day services, which the Moore family attended on June 9, 1912. He left town between 5:00 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. on June 10, 1912, hours before the bodies were discovered. Reverend Kelly had confessed to the murders in court, but the jury didn't believe his confession. In the weeks that followed, he displayed a fascination with the case and wrote many letters to the police, investigators, and family of the deceased. This aroused suspicion and a private investigator wrote back to Reverend Kelly, asking for details that the minister might know about the murders. Kelly replied with great detail, claiming to have heard sounds and possibly witnessed the murders. His known mental illness made authorities question whether he knew the details because of having committed the murders or was imagining his account. In 1914, two years after the murders, Kelly was arrested for sending obscene material through the mail (he was sexually harassing a woman who applied for a job as his secretary). He was sent to St. Elizabeth‚Äôs Hospital, the national mental hospital in Washington, D.C. Investigators speculated again that Kelly could be the murderer of the Moore family. In 1917, Kelly was arrested for the Villisca murders. Police obtained a confession from him; however, it followed many hours of interrogation and Kelly later recanted. After two separate trials, he was acquitted. Frank F. Jones Frank Fernando Jones was a Villisca resident and an Iowa State Senator. Josiah Moore had worked for Frank Jones at his implement store for many years before leaving to open his own store. Moore reportedly took business away from Jones, including a very successful John Deere dealership. Moore was rumored to have had a sexual affair with Jones‚Äô daughter-in-law, though no evidence supports this. William Mansfield Another theory was that Senator Jones hired William \\"Blackie\\" Mansfield to murder the Moore family. It is believed that Mansfield was a serial killer because he murdered his wife, infant child and parents-in-law with an axe two years after the Villisca crimes. He is believed to have committed the axe murders in Paola, Kansas, four days before the Villisca crimes. He was also suspected in the double homicide of Jennie Peterson and Jennie Miller in Illinois. Each crime site was accessible by train, and all murders were carried out in virtually the same manner. Mansfield was released after a special Grand Jury of Montgomery County refused to indict him, on grounds that his alibi checked out. Nine months before the murders at Villisca, a similar case of axe murder occurred in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Two axe murder cases followed in Ellsworth, Kansas, and Paola, Kansas. The cases were similar enough to raise the possibility of having been committed by the same person. Other murders reported as possibly being linked to these crimes include the numerous unsolved axe murders along the Southern Pacific Railroad from 1911‚Äì1912, the unsolved Axeman of New Orleans killings, as well as several other such murders during this time period. The murders in Colorado Springs were closely related in execution to those in the Moore house. Nine months before the Villisca murders, H.C. Wayne, his wife and child, and Mrs. A.J. Burnham were found dead in Colorado Springs, murdered with (an) axe/s. The Colorado Springs Police found it difficult to believe that the same person could perpetrate a similar crime in a city. As in the Villisca murders, bed sheets were used to cover the windows to prevent passersby from looking in. At the Moore house, the murderer hung aprons and skirts to cover the windows. As in the murders in Villisca, the murderer in Colorado Springs wiped the blood off his axe and covered the heads of the victims with bed clothes. Mansfield was also the prime suspect of the Burns Detective Agency of Kansas City and Detective James Newton Wilkerson, who suggested that he was a cocaine-addicted serial killer. According to contemporary news reports, Wilkerson believed Mansfield was responsible for the axe murders of his wife, infant child, father-in law, and mother in law in Blue Island, Illinois, on July 5, 1914 (two years after the Villisca murders), the axe murders committed in Paola, Kansas, four days before the Villisca murders, and the murders of Jennie Peterson and Jennie Miller in Aurora, Illinois. According to Wilkerson's investigation, all of the murders were committed in precisely the same manner, indicating that the same man probably committed them. Wilkerson stated that he could prove that Mansfield was present in each of the differing crime scenes on the night of the murders. In each murder, the victims were hacked to death with an axe and the mirrors in the homes were covered. A burning lamp with the chimney off was left at the foot of the bed and a basin in which the murderer washed was found in the kitchen. In each case, the murderer avoided leaving fingerprints by wearing gloves, which Wilkerson believed was strong evidence that the man was Mansfield, who knew his fingerprints were on file at the federal military prison at Leavenworth. Wilkerson managed to convince a grand jury to open an investigation in 1916, and Mansfield was arrested and brought to Montgomery County from Kansas City. Payroll records, however, provided an alibi that placed Mansfield in Illinois at the time of the Villisca murders. He was released for a lack of evidence, and later won a lawsuit he brought against Wilkerson, and was awarded $2,225. Wilkerson believed that pressure from Jones resulted not only in Mansfield's release but also in the subsequent arrest and trial of Reverend Kelly. However, R.H. Thorpe, a restaurant owner from Shenandoah, Iowa, identified Mansfield as the man he saw the morning after the Villisca murders boarding a train at Clarinda. This man said he had walked from Villisca. If proven to be true, this testimony would disprove Mansfield's alibi. Furthermore, it was reported that a Mrs. Vina Tompkins, of Marshalltown, was on her way to testify that she heard three men in the woods plotting the murder of the Moore family a short time before the killings. Henry Lee Moore (no relation) Henry Lee Moore Henry Lee Moore was a suspected serial killer (who was not related to the slain Moore family) who was convicted of the murder of his mother and grandmother several months after the murders in Villisca, his weapon of choice being an axe. Before and after the murders in Villisca, the very similar axe murders on his mother and grandmother were committed, and all of the cases showed striking similarities, leading to strong suspicion that some, or all of the crimes were committed by an axe-murdering serial killer and, just like \\"Blackie\\" Mansfield, the axe- murdering Henry Moore can also be considered a suspect in some of these slayings. Sam Moyer At the inquest, it was reported that Sam Moyer (Josiah's brother-in-law) often threatened to kill Josiah Moore; however, upon further investigation, Moyer's alibi cleared him of the crime. Paul Mueller In their 2017 book The Man from the Train, Bill James and his daughter Rachel McCarthy James discuss the Villisca murders as part of a much larger series of murders which they believe were all committed by a single serial killer. They conclude the murderer was Paul Mueller (or Miller), an immigrant possibly from Germany who was the subject of an unsuccessful yearlong manhunt as the sole suspect in the 1897 murder of a family in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, who had employed him as a farmhand. James started his research in an attempt to solve the Villisca murders, and with his daughter found archival newspaper stories detailing dozens of families murdered under similar circumstances across the US. The Jameses thus believe that Mueller was guilty of the Villisca murders as part of a killing spree that lasted over a decade, killing at least 59 people in 14 separate incidents, including the Colorado Springs and Paola crimes. The Jameses identify common features to these crimes, many of which are also found at the Villisca scene. The killer selected families who lived near railroad tracks (hence their book's title), seemingly struck in ambush at about midnight while the victims were asleep, used the blunt side of an ax rather than the blade to strike the victims in the head and face, used an ax found at the victim's home and left in plain sight after the murders, covered the victims with blankets to prevent blood splatter, covered windows from inside the house and locked the doors before departure. In Mueller's suspected crimes there was often but not always a sexual motive directed towards a pubescent girl, as with Lena's being partly disrobed. In a blurb on the dust jacket of the hardcover edition of The Man From the Train, professor and crime writer Harold Schecter writes that the James' offered the most probable solution yet for the Villisca murders. In popular culture The paranormal reality television series Ghost Adventures covered the story of the Villisca axe murders, in the episode \\"Villisca Axe Murder House\\". The paranormal reality television series Scariest Places on Earth covered the story of the Villisca axe murders and hosted a paranormal investigation on the property. The case was profiled on the television series Most Terrifying Places in America. The murders were also described in Episode 16 of the podcast Lore, by Aaron Mahnke. As well as being referred to on the Lore tv show. The murders and purported paranormal activity was described in Episode 21 of the podcast And That's Why We Drink. The crime was also detailed in the August 3, 2017 episode of the podcast, Stuff You Should Know. The slayings were the subject of a book, Morning Ran Red, by Stephen Bowman. The murders were the subject of a 2016 book, Murdered in Their Beds, by paranormal author and researcher Troy Taylor, who discussed the murders as part of a larger pattern of axe murders throughout the Midwest. Tony E. Valenzuela directed a 2016 horror movie, The Axe Murders of Villisca. The film establishes Reverend Kelly as the killer (albeit while possessed). The podcast Last Podcast on the Left covered this case in their episode Axe Murderers Part 2- Pinning Butterflies (episode 163, December 20, 2017) The podcast My Favorite Murder covered this case in their live episode in Des Moines, Iowa (episode 168, March 23, 2019).

Most recently, TNT had the cable rights to the PGA Championship (with full coverage of the first two rounds and early coverage of the weekend rounds since 1999 after being on sister channel TBS since 1991) under a contract with the PGA of America. The channel has generally only carried major competitions, as opposed to the other week-to-week tournaments which are under the auspices of the PGA Tour, an organization which is independent of the PGA of America. History In the past, TNT owned cable rights to the (British) Open Championship, as well as the Women's British Open and Senior British Open, from 2003 to 2009 (with ABC picking up weekend coverage), replacing (and ultimately being replaced by) ESPN. TNT carried the first two rounds of the PGA Championship through 2019, with Turner having covered the event since 1991, at first on TBS and later TNT. TNT also carried the biennial PGA Tour- managed Presidents Cup from 2000 to 2007; Golf Channel assumed those rights beginning with the 2009 event as part of its overall deal for PGA Tour cable rights. TNT also broadcast the first two rounds of the Target World Challenge from 1999‚Äì2002, and the first three rounds of the five-round Bob Hope Chrysler Classic from 1995‚Äì98, along with other select events. Beginning in 2004, TNT as well as CBS, began broadcasting the PGA Championship in HDTV, although some cameras used SD widescreen through 2006. Meanwhile the Open Championship was shown in widescreen SD from 2004 through the end of TNT‚Äôs run in 2009 (weekend rights-holder ABC was forced to do the same, as only SD widescreen cameras were used by the home BBC broadcast). The 2007 Presidents Cup was mostly in HD, with a handful of SD widescreen cameras also being used (this was the standard setup of weekend rights-holder NBC at the time). On October 10, 2018, it was announced that ESPN would replace TNT as the PGA Championship's cable partner beginning in 2020, with CBS remaining broadcast television rightsholder. This deal left TNT without any golf coverage. Scheduled time for Turner coverage by year British Open *2003-2004: 19 - When TNT took over the cable package for the British Open in 2003, they started providing 2 hours of early morning coverage on both weekend days prior to the start of ABC's air-time. *2005-2006: 20 *2007-2009: 19 PGA Championship *1991-1996: 16 - When TBS took over the cable package for the PGA Championship in 1991, they increased the weekday coverage to 6 hours per day. TBS also added 2 hours of Saturday and Sunday coverage. *1997: 17 *1998: 17 *1999-2005: 17 *2006-2009: 18 *2010: 19 *2011-2013: 18 - Because inclement weather stopped play during the third round of 2012 PGA Championship on Saturday, TNT added coverage starting at 8 a.m. ET on Sunday. The Match 2 In May 2020, following the Covid-19 pandemic, TNT gained the rights to ‚ÄúCapital One‚Äôs The Match 2: Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning vs. Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady‚Äù. The event took place May 24 at the Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida. The regular TNT golf team from the 2019 PGA covered the event, in addition to NBA on TNT analyst Charles Barkley and PGA Tour player Justin Thomas. TNT had previously produced coverage of the original ‚ÄúThe Match‚Äù event between Woods and Mickelson in 2018, however that aired only on pay-per-view. Like the original, ‚ÄúThe Match 2‚Äù featured all players mic‚Äôd up, and also provided earpieces to allow the players, from their custom-designed golf carts, to chat with the members of the broadcast booth (including Barkley) who were in the 18th tower. The telecast, which was delayed slightly by rain, peaked at 6.3 million viewers, and averaged 5.8 million for the afternoon. The 3pm EDT Sunday broadcast was the highest rated and most watched golf event ever to air on a cable channel, meaning the telecast beat every Thursday and Friday round in PGA Tour history including TNT‚Äôs own coverage of the British Open, PGA Championship, and Presidents Cup.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 13th century. The manuscript is lacunose.  Description  The original codex contained lessons from the Gospel of John, Matthew, and Luke (Evangelistarium), on 230 parchment leaves, with some lacunae. The leaves are measured (). It contains Menologion on folios 171-320, accompanied by Apostolarion (lessons from Book of Acts and Epistles). The text is written in Greek minuscule letters, in two columns per page, 23 lines per page. It contains breathings and accents. The ink is brown. There are a few headpieces and decorated initial letters. The manuscript contains weekday Gospel lessons for Church reading from Easter to Pentecost and Saturday/Sunday Gospel lessons for the other weeks.  History  Gregory dated the manuscript to the 12th century. It is presently assigned by the INTF to the 13th century. Edward Everett, an American educator (who later gained fame as a politician, diplomat, and orator), bought the manuscript in 1819, during his first visit in Greece, along with six other Greek manuscripts. Everett used every opportunity of searching for Greek manuscripts. He brought the manuscript to America. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Caspar Ren√© Gregory (number 297e). Scrivener catalogued this manuscript as 484e on his list. The manuscript was examined by Edward A. Guy, who designated it by siglum 2h (Lectionary 296 received siglum 1h, Lectionary 298 ‚Äì 3h). Gregory saw the manuscript in 1878.

The album took almost one and a half years to produce. It comprises twelve original music tracks. Overview Like its predecessors, Sentient Genus compiles a wide variety of musical styles throughout its twelve tracks, including electronic music, symphonic, ambient music, world music, and ethnic music. For the production of the album's last track, Little blue planet, Australis had the collaboration of Sofia Luna, who performed two short vocal speeches. Following the signature already observed in his previous two releases, Sentient Genus presents an eclectic collection of several music genres, creating an always changing experience as the listener is taken from one acoustic context to another completely different when a track ends and another beings. According to Australis, Sentient Genus explores the human species from several different angles, presenting us with a window to our emotions, our intentions and our nature.

The greatest happiness principle, Gay supposed, represented a middle ground between the egoism of Hobbes and Hutcheson's moral sense theory. Education Gay was educated at Torrington School and Blundell's School. In 1718 he was elected Blundell's Scholar at Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1721/2 and M.A. in 1725. From 1724 to 1732 he was a Fellow of the College, lecturing in Hebrew, Greek, and ecclesiastical history. Philosophy Gay's philosophical works argued that virtue was conforming to a rule of life which promotes the happiness of others. His short \\"Dissertation concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality\\" was first published as a preface to Edmund Law's translation of William King's Latin Essay on the Origin of Evil (1731). (Law was Bishop of Carlisle and King was Archbishop of Dublin.) The \\"Dissertation\\" is one of the seminal works in the history of English utilitarianism. In the eighteenth century its influence may be found in the works of the theological utilitarians, Abraham Tucker (The Light of Nature Pursued, 7 vols., 1768‚Äì1778) and William Paley (Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy, 1785). David Hartley said that Gay's assertion of the importance of psychological association in human nature was the origin of his Observations on Man (1749). In 1730 Gay resigned his fellowship and became Vicar of Wilshampstead, later adding the living of Haynes. He died on 18 July 1745, and was buried at Wilshampstead on 22 July.

It was released in Japan on October 7, 1994, and in North America in October 1995. The player controls a young man known as Kyle, who rides to the vampire Nosferatu's castle in order to defeat him and save his beloved girlfriend Erin from his clutches. Plot The game follows the story of a young man named Kyle who has his girlfriend Erin sequestered with the vampire Nosferatu; he has the objective of obtaining their blood. Kyle then goes up to the castle where Nosferatu lurks with the intent to rescue Erin, but getting there, he discovers that the huge place is full of traps and violent creatures. The game starts with Kyle being trapped in the dungeon of the castle, and the player must escape from there and walk through the castle until they reach the tower where Erin and Nosferatu are. Gameplay The player fights the ape bosses of the second stage. The game is played like Prince of Persia, however the player fights with his bare fists. Despite that, they can use many unique moves and special combos with attacking. He fights various monsters such as Frankenstein's monsters, zombies, gargoyles and ghosts. The bosses are the Werewolf and Beast Men, amongst others. There are three types of crystals used in the game in addition to an hourglass. Finding an hourglass extends the in- game time. Each crystal has its own abilities: red crystals give players a power-up at every three crystals, green crystals recover the health of the player while the blue crystal extends the player's health bar. Development and release Nosferatu was programmed by T. Nakamura, Hiroki Azumada, Yoshihiro Ando and Tetsuo Mochizuki. K≈çji Isoda, K≈çz≈ç Igarashi and Shingo Aoyama served as graphic designers. Opus Corp handled the audio for the game, with Masanao Akahori composed the music, and Jun Enoki created the sound effects. Nosferatu was released by SETA Corporation on October 7, 1994, in Japan. This was followed by its North American release in October 1995. Reception GamePro judged the game to be a frustratingly difficult but still worthwhile cinematic platformer. They elaborated that the game is frustrating due to the sometimes slow character movements and lack of any password or save function, and that the strong atmosphere and slow-paced, strategic approach are its strong points. Most of the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the graphics and sound to be impressive, but they all complained about frustrations resulting from poor responsiveness in the controls. They all also said that the game was something of a disappointment in light of how long it had spent in development (it was announced before the Super NES launch) and how heavily hyped it had been. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame praised Nosferatu graphics and audio, making the game \\"imbued with cinematic style and flair\\", but criticized its controls. Weiss also derided the game's combat, which he considered \\"redundant and largely unexciting\\". Game Informer magazine gave it an overall score of 6.75.

He fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War and was killed in action. Savile was born at Thornhill, the son of Sir George Savile and Anne Wentworth, and the grandson of Sir George Savile, 1st Baronet.\\"The English Baronetage\\" pg. 159 He inherited the baronetcy on the death of his brother George in 1626. Included in the family estates were the residences of Thornhill Hall, Rufford Abbey, and a house in York. He was educated at University College, Oxford and entered Gray's Inn in 1628. Wentworth selected him to be Deputy Lieutenant of the West Riding in 1633, and he was appointed to the council in the north in July 1636.Ingilby History - Ripley Castle In April 1640, Savile was elected Member of Parliament for Yorkshire in the Short Parliament. In parliament, he spoke against ship money and signed the petition against forced billeting, but he remained loyal to the king. He was defeated in the election of November 1640 and was returned as MP for Old Sarum in a by-election early in 1641. He gave evidence in favour of Strafford and supported him throughout the trial. He was himself committed to the Tower on 12 June for an unidentified offence and let out on 29 June after a reprimand from the Speaker. Savile was with the king at Nottingham when the royal standard was raised on 22 August 1642. He was marked as a \\"suspicious man\\" and was disabled from sitting in the Commons by parliament. Towards the end of 1642 Savile was placed in command at Leeds when Newcastle marched into the West Riding but on 23 January 1643 Fairfax captured the town after a fierce attack and Savile swam across the River Aire to escape. In May 1643 he was appointed governor of the town of Sheffield and of Sheffield Castle and then transferred to York. In October 1643 he was in command of the Royalist cavalry at the Battle of Winceby. He died at or near York fighting for the king in January 1644. He had converted Thornhill Hall into a garrison for the King's forces, and it was demolished by parliamentary forces after its capture by Cromwell. Family Savile married Anne, daughter of Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry, on 29 December 1629. She became celebrated as a heroine of the civil war when she was besieged by the Parliamentarians in Sheffield Castle.

He was until 2017 the Director-General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). OLAF is a department of the European Commission, but it is independent in its investigative function. Based in Brussels, OLAF is tasked with protecting the financial interests of the European Union by investigating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities. It also investigates serious matters relating to the discharge of professional duties by members and staff of the EU institutions and it supports the EU institutions, in particular the European Commission, in the development and implementation of anti-fraud legislation and policies. Early life and education Giovanni Kessler is the son of Bruno Kessler (1924‚Äì1991), a former President of the Autonomous Province of Trento and vice-minister to the Interior. Kessler graduated in law at the University of Bologna. Career In 1985, Kessler became a member of the Italian judiciary and served as prosecutor in the courts of Trento and then of Bolzano. From 1995 he worked for two years as anti-mafia prosecutor in Caltanissetta (Sicily) at the anti- mafia Directorate. From 1998 to 1999, Kessler was Deputy Head of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission in Pristina, in charge of Police and Justice matters. As judicial expert, he also participated to several evaluation missions of the European Commission and Council of Europe in Eastern Europe. Member of the Parliament of Italy, 2001-2006 In 2001, Kessler was elected to the Italian Parliament as an independent member. He sat on the Committee on Justice Affairs and during his five-year term, he authored numerous bills on the International Criminal Court (ICC), the European Convention against corruption, the International Judiciary Cooperation and the European Arrest Warrant. In addition to his committee assignments, Kessler was also a member of the Italian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). From 2003 until 2006, he served as Vice-President of the Assembly. He participated in and led International Election Monitoring missions in the United States and in many other OSCE countries. In 2003, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Dutch Foreign Minister Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, appointed Kessler as his Special Representative during that year's parliamentary election in Armenia.Italian Parliamentarian Giovanni Kessler to lead OSCE observation of Armenian elections OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, press release of 23 May 2003. From 2006 to 2008, Kessler held the position of Italian High Commissioner to Combat Counterfeiting. In December 2008, Kessler was elected member, and subsequently President, of the Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Province of Trento. He resigned from this position before taking up the post of Director-General of OLAF in early 2011. In 2009 Kessler started with Dieter Steger (SVP) and Herwig van Staa (√ñVP), chairmen of the legislative assemblies of South Tyrol and Tyrol, the project of a Euroregion that, for the three territories, would represent a recovery of historical Tyrol. The legislative assemblies of the autonomous provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol and Tyrol then unanimously approved the Euroregion Tyrol ‚Äì South Tyrol ‚Äì Trentino.

Later, the Council of the European Union decided that Kessler and Johan Denolf, from the anti-fraud unit of the Belgian judicial police, were their top two.OLAF's frontrunner European Voice, November 24, 2010. Kessler took office in February 2011 and soon became engaged in a comprehensive reform process to strengthen the efficiency of OLAF, aiming to step-up the fight against fraud and corruption in Europe. In 2012, he was elected President of the European Partners Against Corruption / European Anti-Corruption Network (EPAC/EACN), a formal network comprising close to fifty anti-corruption authorities from European Union Member States. The Network was set up to improve cooperation between authorities mandated with the fight against corruption in the European Union, as well as to foster closer relations between Member States and the European institutions. Upon taking office, Kessler led the investigation into the 2011 cash for influence scandal in the European Parliament. During that time, OLAF was working closely with national authorities from Austria, Slovenia, Romania, Spain, Belgium and France; two MEPs ‚Äì from Austria and Slovenia ‚Äì resigned; a third was suspended by his party.Constant Brand (May 25, 2011), New OLAF boss embarks on reforms European Voice. From 2012, Kessler oversaw the investigation that led to John Dalli, the then European health commissioner, losing his job over accusations that he asked for cash from a tobacco company in exchange for opening up the EU market to that company‚Äôs products. That investigation also ensnared Kessler, with Belgian authorities starting an investigation into allegations that he had broken the law during OLAF‚Äôs probe into Dalli. The European Commission lifted his immunity, opening him up to prosecution, prompting Kessler to launch legal action.

Early life and education  Powers was born in Bristol, New Hampshire on July 8, 1820. His parents, Jonathan and Anna (Kendall) Powers, were natives of Groton and Hebron, New Hampshire. In 1826, the family moved to Lansingburgh, New York, where he was educated in public schools. When he was 18, learned the trade of cabinet maker. He early showed aptness and skill at machine work, a faculty which ever after proved useful and profitable to him.  Career  In June 1847, Powers and his family, then consisting of his wife and one child, William Henry, came to Grand Rapids following after \\"uncle\\" John Ball. His chief business capital at the time was a good trade, about $300, in cash, a pair of willing hands and a spirit of energy and determination. Here he began work in a small shop at the southeast corner of Fountain and Ionia streets, where he rented bench room. Soon afterward he secured better quarters by the east bank of the river above Bridge Street and began working by machinery, using water power; making furniture of nearly all kinds then produced, and chairs, not only for the home trade, but for exportation, and having a salesroom near the foot of Canal Street. In 1850 he formed a partnership with Ebenezer Morris Ball, under the firm name of Powers & Ball, in the furniture trade, their business place being near where is the south entrance to the Arcade. In 1852 they built a sawmill to which they added a larger structure for a factory, on Erie Street, where the business grew rapidly; soon giving work to some forty employees, and establishing an export trade in ready made stock for chairs, furniture and McCormick reapers. In January, 1855, this partnership was dissolved, and Mr. Powers turned his attention to lumbering, operating a steam mill with a circular saw, the first of its kind in this part of the state, which the firm had built above Leonard Street on the west bank of the river. About the same time he constructed a machine with a gang of circular saws for slitting thick plank into siding and flooring. He added furniture making to his business, and for a time before the Civil War had an extensive sales room on Canal Street, near Erie. In 1865 and 1866 he purchased the river frontage necessary and in the three following years constructed the West Side Water Power Canal, a description of which is given in Baxter's History of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Powers erected over thirty structure in Grand Rapids for houses, mills, stores, factories and other purposes. Most prominent among these is Powers‚Äô Grand Opera House. Notable in his work, also, is the Arcade artesian well, where so many thousands daily partake of its refreshing waters, free ‚Äî a public benefaction. In 1880 he caused the organizing of an electric lighting plant and company to Grand Rapids, Michigan, the first city lighting by electricity in Michigan. The works were operated chiefly by water power. The first industrial use of hydropower in the United States to generate electricity occurred in 1880, when 16 brush-arc lamps were powered using a water turbine at the Wolverine Chair and Furniture Factory; operated by William H. Powers, his son. In 1885, William T. Powers & Son purchased and moved their operation to the Michigan Iron Works. He served as president of the Electric Light and Power Company for many years, later known as Consumers Electric Light and Power, which has become a part of Consumers Energy. Indomitable and persistent industry and energy have marked the career of Mr. Powers in Grand Rapids; and besides his successful enterprises at home he was actively and prosperously engaged in the development of valuable properties in and near Spearfish, South Dakota in the Black Hills region, where he had a water power of some 300 to 400 horse power, some manufacturing buildings, and about 400 acres of land. While in Spearfish he had a saw mill, furniture factory, door and sash company, plaster mine, and mercantile store. He exhibited great interest in the material growth and advancement of Grand Rapids. He was chosen City Treasurer in 1853 and again in 1854, serving two terms. In 1857, he was elected Mayor and served one term, during which he started and gave a lasting impetus to the system of street improvements that has been so prominent a factor in city development and progress. Powers was a member of the Democratic Party.  Personal life  In 1839, Powers married Louisa Hall, a native of London, England. The couple had six children. Powers died in Grand Rapids, Michigan on June 19, 1909. References Baxter, Albert, History of the City of Grand Rapids, New York and Grand Rapids: Munsell & Company, Publishers, ¬©1891.

In 2008, so inspired by the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Wells donated ¬£2 million to a sports athletics fund to sponsor future British athletes. Biography The grandson of former World Pole Vault record holder Ernest Latimer Stones, Wells was born and raised in Bootle, Liverpool and educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby. Wells set up direct home and motor insurance operation Prospero Direct, which after its sale became Axa Direct. He then setup Premierline Direct, the UK's first direct commercial insurance operation which he founded with his business partner, Philippa Rothwell; this was then sold to Allianz in 2006. Wells was also a non- executive director of Marks & Spencer Money for ten years. A keen amateur 400m runner, Wells has travelled to every Olympic Games since 1972. He has had a box at Liverpool F.C.'s Anfield ground since 2010, which he donates for the use of seriously ill and disabled children. Wells was made an Honorary Doctor of Business Administration by Edge Hill University in 2014 and is also an Honorary Teaching Fellow at Lancaster University. He is a Patron of Alder Hey Children's Charity.Alder Hey Charity. \\"Meet our supporters\\" , Liverpool 2013. Retrieved on 23 June 2014. In 2016 Wells was awarded the Points of Light accolade by the Prime Minister in recognition of his exceptional philanthropic work. Wells currently actively manages a portfolio of private equity and property investments alongside his role as Chairman and sole funder of the Barrie Wells Trust. Barrie Wells Trust After being inspired by a visit to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Wells set up the Wells Sports Foundation, which was rebranded in 2015 as the Barrie Wells Trust. Wells personally funded 18 athletes in the buildup to the 2012 Olympics. He helped to make a real difference to their preparations for international sporting competitions, and experienced being part of each of the athletes' individual journeys. The first athlete sponsored was Liverpool heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson. Wells also created 'Athletes4Schools,' which ran from 2009 up until the London 2012 Olympics, inspiring over 35,000 children. This initiative involved many of the 18 elite athletes personally funded by Wells, visiting schools in various parts of the UK to deliver free, fun and educational workshops. The charity also supported sports clubs and schools with grants of up to ¬£2,000 to fund initiatives that increased participation in sport. This also ended in 2012. In 2010 Wells launched his Box4Kids initiative. Box4Kids provides once in a lifetime opportunities for seriously ill children to enjoy VIP days at major sporting and entertainment events across the UK from the luxury of executive boxes. Box4Kids initially started when Wells purchased a box at Liverpool Football Club and it has since been used solely for Box4Kids. This was so successful that Wells then approached individuals and organisations across the UK to ask for donations of boxes each year. Box4Kids now operates in 94 major venues across the UK, embracing 12 different sports and every entertainment arena in the country. Box4Kids is also the charity partner of the Jockey Club and Farnborough Airshow. With a network of 137 companies and connections with 93 different hospitals and hospices across the UK, Box4Kids has benefited over 8,000 seriously ill children and their family members. Box4Kids has also started to expand overseas starting with the Singapore Airshow.

It aired on December 13, 2010. It features guest star Alex Trebek. Plot Ted is outside a movie theater showing It's a Wonderful Life, waiting for the rest of the gang and carrying a gingerbread house as their Christmas-themed movie snack. Future Ted backtracks to two days before, when Marshall and Lily eagerly await the results of her latest pregnancy test. The test is positive and they excitedly tell Ted, Barney, and Robin the news, but the doctor later says it is a false alarm and Future Ted tells the story of what happened during the past two days. Prior to the test, Ted and Punchy begin talking about Punchy's wedding. After hanging up, Ted argues with Robin about his ability to be an effective best man, especially in the event that Punchy gets cold feet. Robin reveals that she auditioned as a \\"currency rotation specialist\\" (coin-flip bimbo) in the game show Million Dollar Heads or Tails, hosted by Alex Trebek. Ted rebukes her for bailing on her New Year's Resolution to be working for the World Wide News network by the end of the year. Robin admits that she applied for the network, but only an associate researcher position is available. When Marshall and Lily break the news of the pregnancy, Robin becomes aware of how her own life is stalling, and resolves to take the research position, but when they reveal the false positive, she changes her mind once more, deciding that she is content to be a \\"coin-flip bimbo\\". Barney, meanwhile, has received an end-of-year bonus, which he intends to spend on luxuries for himself, including a suit with diamond pinstripes. When he hears about the pregnancy, he realizes how unfulfilled his selfishness has left him, and decides to spend the money helping others. After buying the patrons of MacLaren's designer clothes, toys and condoms, and taking them to a strip club, Barney goes to see Sam Gibbs, his brother's father and a minister, to make a donation to his church. He begins to write a check for $10,000 when he gets the news about the false positive, and adds a decimal point to turn it into $100, returning to his selfish ways and, indeed, buying his diamond-striped suit. Immediately after they discover and announce the pregnancy test's results, Marshall and Lily secretly begin to panic about how unprepared they are to raise a child, and scramble to complete pre-delivery remodelling of their apartment in one night. After an argument about playing music for the child, the couple see the doctor, who tells them Lily is not pregnant. Marshall and Lily meet up with the rest of the gang outside the theater and admit that they are relieved about the false positive. Since they are not ready for kids, they are considering getting a dog for now. When Robin and Barney agree with them, Ted angrily smashes the gingerbread house and orders everybody to reconsider their decisions, forcing Marshall and Lily to go straight back home to try to conceive, yelling to the \\"criminals of New York\\" about Barney's suit, effectively making him a walking target for theft, and ordering Robin to take the research job. When Punchy calls him, suffering the predicted cold feet, Ted angrily orders him to get married, solving that problem as well. After everyone leaves, he decides to watch It's a Wonderful Life alone. In the end, Marshall and Lily continue trying to conceive, Barney returns the diamond suit, makes his intended cash donation to the ministry and also donates suits for jobless people to wear to interviews, and Robin begins her first day at World Wide News. Back at the apartment, Robin thanks Ted for his fit of rage and he accepts her offer to be the best man if she ever marries anyone else.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1990. Description and history The Goold house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, clad in clapboards and shingles. Facing south is a Greek Revival gable end, which has been partly obscured by an early 20th-century Colonial Revival porch. The porch is supported by four columns with decoratively carved wooden capitals, and four lattice posts. The columns were reclaimed from an old church in Portland as well as several wood carvings that decorate the homes interior. The porch wraps around the sides of the house, and has a hip roof. The main entrance is in the middle bay of three, and is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a four-light transom window. The upper level of the house has a side-gable roof, with three dormers facing front. The central dormer is larger, with a gable roof, while the flanking dormers have hip roofs. To the rear of the main block is a single-story addition, which features a distinctive bell tower, which has a bullseye window and formerly an open belvedere under a hip roof. The interior of the house features predominantly Colonial Revival styling.

Full professor and head, Department of Clinical Neurology at the University of Vienna Medical University of Vienna, professor emeritus since October 2006, Deecke is also head of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Functional Brain Topography and is the author of a number of books and more than 600 publications in the fields of neurology, clinical neurology, neurophysiology, clinical neurophysiology, neurosciences, brain research, movement disorders, etc. His early research with Hans Helmut Kornhuber in the mid-1960s led to the discovery of the Bereitschaftspotential (or readiness potential), which is a measure of neural activity in the brain that precedes voluntary movements. This discovery set an important standard in research and rehabilitation of motor systems, and re- introduced the word will in key word registers.  Scientific contribution  In 1964 Deecke performed as doctoral student of Hans Helmut Kornhuber, EEG- recordings in man accompanying volitional movements and actions, and they discovered a slowly increasing activation (negative deflection) in the EEG, which they called BereitschaftspotentialH.

The term Bereitschaftspotential (BP) can be found in the ‚ÄòList of German expressions in English‚Äò. In order to record brain activity prior to an unforeseeable event ‚Äì which a voluntary movement undoubtedly is ‚Äì it needs a special method: the reverse averaging, which was invented by Kornhuber and Deecke in the same year (1964).

In: Current Contents Life Sciences. 33 (4): 14 (1990) and Current Contents Clinical Medicine. 18 (4): 14 (1990) In 1970 and 1971 Deecke was a research fellow in Toronto, Canada, under John M. Fredrickson. He performed experiments in the vestibular system (sense of balance) with rhesus monkeys and found the thalamic relay nucleus, nucleus ventralis posterior inferior (VPI) for the vestibular projection to the cortex.L.

Aerospace Med 44: 1106-1111 (1973) In 1978 a further Citation Classic appeared with the discovery that the supplementary motor area (SMA) is active prior to voluntary actions and also prior to the activation of the primary motor cortex (M1, Brodmann-Area4).L.

Kornhuber: \\"An electrical sign of participation of the mesial ‚Äúsupplementary‚Äù motor cortex in human voluntary finger movements.\\" In: Brain Res. 159, 1978, S. 473‚Äì476, (Citation Classic). This publication established the scientific knowledge that the early component of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP1 or BPearly) is generated by the activity of the SMA. BP1 is bilaterally symmetrical, because always ‚Äì i.e. also with unilateral actions ‚Äì the SMAs of both hemispheres are active, further substantiated by subsequent research.Deecke L, Lang W (1996) Generation of movement-related potentials and fields in the supplementary sensorimotor area and the primary motor area. Advances in Neurology, Vol. 70: Supplementary Sensorimotor Area, HO L√ºders (Ed) pp 127-146 The second component of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP2 oder BPlate) is generated by the primary motor cortex M1, and BP2 is asymmetrical with unilateral movements, namely dominant over the contralateral hemisphere. In Ulm, Deecke had projects with the DFG (German Research Foundation), and a productive team with research on the vestibular system and the motor system emerged including vestibular and neck interaction.Mergner T, Deecke L, Becker W (1981) Patterns of vestibular and neck responses and their interaction: A comparison between cat cortical neurons and human psychophysics.

Deecke, H. Weinberg, P. Brickett: Magnetic fields of the human brain accompanying voluntary movement. Bereitschaftsmagnetfeld. In: Exp Brain Res. 48, 1982, S. 144‚Äì148. From 1985 on in Vienna, Deecke has built his own MEG, the first generation with a five-channel MEG-System, and from 1995 on with the MEG Centre Vienna an MEG-whole head system with 143 channels (CTF Vancouver, Canada) has been established. Deecke and his team were successful to prove the participation of the SMA not only with the early Bereitschaftspotential but also with the Bereitschaftsmagnetfeld (Bereitschaftsfield in the MEG, solving the cancellation problem of the two SMAs opposing each other.W.

Ann NY Acad Sci, Vol 425: 450-464 Evidence was found that the frontal cortex (SMA, prefrontal cortex) gives the starting command of the movement or action and supervises it, but the SMA does not execute the action. The frontal brain (including the SMA) is ‚Äòdelegating' this to the ‚Äòexpert systems for tracking in the brain‚Äò, namely to the visual cortex and to the M1. In 2002 the term Bereitschafts-BOLD response was coined by Ross Cunnington et al. in event-related fMRI studies at the Department of Clinical Neurology and the Department of Radiodiagnostics Medical University of Vienna.R.

Moser: The preparation and readiness for voluntary movement: a high-field event-related fMRI study of the Bereitschafts-BOLD response. NeuroImage 20: 404‚Äì412 (2003) Thus, according to Deecke und Kornhuber [7],[15],[16] the early component of the BP (BP1 or BPearly) is generated by the following areas: the SMA proper, the pre-SMA and the cingulate motor area, CMA. This is now called anterior mid-cingulate cortex, aMCC. The second component (BP2 or BP late) is generated by the motor cortex (M1). Contrary to earlier views, the intentional activity according to Kornhuber and Deecke does not travel directly from the SMA to motor cortex M1 but is running via the cortico-basalganglio-thalamo- cortical loop in short motor loop. The motor loop has been discovered in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).It could be shown, that deep brain stimulation improves frontal cortex function in PD patients.Gerschlager W, Alesch F, Cunnington R, Deecke L, Dirnberger G, Endl W, Lindinger G, Lang W (1999) Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation improves frontal cortex function in Parkinson's disease. An electrophysiological study of the contingent negative variation. Brain 122: 2365-2373 This means that the formation of the will has already taken place in the frontal lobe and the preparation and planning of the action has been transferred initially to the unconscious routine processes of the basal ganglia, which do the groundwork for the motor cortex, M1.H.

Deecke: The will and its brain ‚Äì an appraisal of reasoned free will. University Press of America, Lanham MD, USA 2012, . M1 finally generates the volley for the pyramidal tract, which then enters consciousness. During the early BP, BP1, the action planning is not yet conscious, but during BP2 it is. From this observation Benjamin Libet,B. Libet, C. A. Gleason, E. W. Wright, D. K. Pearl: Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness potential): The unconscious initiation of a freely voluntary act. In: Brain. 106, 1983, S. 623‚Äì642. postulated that we do not have free will (BP1) but with the control of the action (BP2) we do have free will.

In: M Jahanshahi, M Hallett(Eds) The Bereitschaftspotential, movement-related cortical potentials. Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers New York, pp 283-320 have shown that consciousness is not a sine qua non for free will. There are conscious and unconscious agendas in the brain, and both are important. The unconscious agendas far outweigh the conscious agendas, consciousness being only the ‚Äòtip of an iceberg‚Äô. Therefore, free will is involved with both, the initiation of the action and for the control of the action. The views of Kornhuber and Deecke upon the SMA and CMA were confirmed in the meantime by Ross Cunnington and his team: The limbic system is always involved in the early planning for action ‚Äì the matching with the inner needs, the emotional basic state, and our respective mood ‚Äì has been postulated by Kornhuber and Deecke for quite some time and has been confirmed recently by the Cunnington group.V.

Kornhuber and Deecke have shown that freedom is given, a freedom in degrees of freedom, that humans can regulate up by their own efforts and learning in order to improve their free will, which is not a granted state but a dynamic process.

Based in Indianapolis, CMF has missionaries and ministry partners in more than 25 countries. The purpose of CMFI is to transform lives and communities through church planting, serving the urban poor, international campus ministry, international development, and marketplace ministry.Priest, Doug (07/15/2001). \\"From Lines to Circles\\", The Christian Standard; Vol. 136:28 History CMFI began in 1946 after Christian missionary Jess Johnson traveled to India. During his time there he began to brainstorm different ideas for missionary relations with the countries and communities in which missionaries are stationed. When he arrived back in America, Johnson contacted Christian leaders around the nation to come up with different strategies for the mission's work. In 1952 CMFI was founded at Manhattan Bible College in Kansas. During the course of its first year, CMFI sent missionary families into India. During the 1960s CMFI rexpanded and teams of missionaries began to penetrate countries like Ethiopia and Brazil. In the 1970s and 1980s CMFI had missionaries operating in Kenya, Mexico, Tanzania, Chile, and England. By the next decade teams were also working in Singapore, Benin, Thailand, Ukraine, and the Ivory Coast as were intercultural groups within the United States. There is a CMFI presence in 17 countries and around 165 missionaries are in the field. Programs Reach Reach is a summer internship program designed by CMFI for college-age students who want to experience missions work over a period of 2‚Äì3 months. CHE Community Health and Evangelism (CHE) is a program that CMFI uses in poor urban and village communities to combine public health improvements and evangelism work. The program is designed to teach members of poor communities about the gospel and about basic sanitation and health promotion. Globalscope Along with Reach, CMFI has a program for international college campuses called Globalscope. The main purpose of Globalscope is to provide a campus ministry for college students to come to for bible studies and discipleship. Globalscope ministries operate in Montevideo, Santiago, Puebla, Bangkok, Salamanca, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Erlangen, Freiburg, Val√®ncia, Nottingham and T√ºbingen.Hudson, Sheila (09/14/2004). \\"The English Channel\\". The Christian Standard: Vol.139:36 Bi- vocational Ministry CMFI's Bi-vocational Ministry is specifically for sending missionaries with other vocations into countries that do not allow Christian missionaries to attain visas. People who serve with the Bi- vocational Ministry have a traditional occupation or set of skills and the ability to act as a full-time missionary. Microfinancing Because of the poor economic conditions of many of the countries in which CMFI works, it also provides information on microfinance to the communities it serves. An example of this kind of ministry is with Hope International, with which CMFI partners. Usually a group from a poor or impoverished community will receive training in basic trades, bookkeeping and marketing. Each new business will receive a small loan to get it off the ground. Microfinancing plays a large role in CHE.

In 2002, eight men were arrested and tried for the murder. All of them were found guilty, with three receiving life sentences. Related events Coincidentally, the event took place soon after replacement of the Governor of Donetsk Oblast Volodymyr Shcherban (no relation to Yevhen) with the former Minister of Coal Industry of Ukraine Serhiy Polyakov and the appointment of Viktor Yanukovych to the position of a deputy chairman. Previously, in December 1995, when Serhiy Polyakov was appointed to the ministerial position in Donetsk, the Industrial Union of Donbas (ISD) was established. Headed by Serhiy Taruta, many however saw the real leader of the Union as Yevhen Shcherban. Preceding that in October 1995 another no less important assassination of Akhat Bragin took place. Since then a number of assassinations of lesser ISD members took place from January to July 1996. However, the assassination of Shcherban became the most noticeable, because he was a People's Deputy of Ukraine.

The farm has been held in the same family since 1738, and features an architecturally distinctive Gothic Revival main house. It is also notable as a summer estate of John Anderson, a prominent mid-19th century Maine politician, and of his son John Farwell Anderson, a noted civil engineer and agriculturalist. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history Maplewood Farm consists of several parcels of land, organized in a long strip that is roughly bisected by River Road, and whose western edge is the Presumpscot River. Most of this land is now wooded, the principal exception being a large clearing in which the farm's buildings are located, set at a remove from the southwest side of River Road. The main house is a c. 1770 two story wood frame structure, which underwent significant alterations in about 1850 to give it its present Gothic Revival appearance, with steeply pitched gables, bargeboard decoration, and lancet-arched windows. Also surviving from the mid-19th century are two barns and a small cottage. The small Anderson family cemetery is set near the road, southeast of the building complex. The farm property was purchased in 1738 by Abraham Anderson, and was (at the time of the property's listing on the National Register) in 1991 still in the hands of his descendants. The core of the farmhouse was probably built in the mid-1770s by Edward Anderson, not long after his 1774 marriage. In the mid-19th century the property passed to John Anderson, a noted Maine politician who transformed the property into a summer estate and gentleman's farm. Anderson retained Portland architect Charles A. Alexander to make the Gothic Revival alterations to the house, and it is assumed Alexander also developed the plans for the other surviving buildings. John Anderson's son, John Farwell Anderson, is notable for introducing Devon cattle into the state on this farm, and making it one of Windham's most successful farms in the 1860s. Maplewood Farm has statewide architectural significance for the remarkably well-kept collection of Gothic Revival structures, which is one of a very small number of such assemblages in the state.

It was based in the city of Mrauk-U, near the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal. The kingdom from 1429 to 1785 ruled over what is now Rakhine State, Myanmar and Chittagong Division, Bangladesh. From 1429 to 1531 it was a protectorate of the Bengal Sultanate at different time periods.Maung Maung Tin, Vol. 2, p. 25 After gaining independence from Bengal, it prospered with help from the Portuguese settlement in Chittagong. In 1666, it lost control of Chittagong after a war with the Mughal Empire. Its reign continued until the 18th century, when it fell to the invasion of the Burmese Empire.Phayre 1883: 78Harvey 1925: 140‚Äì141 It was home to a multiethnic population with the city of Mrauk U being home to mosques, temples, shrines, seminaries and libraries. The kingdom was also a center of piracy and the slave trade. It was frequented by Arab, Danish, Dutch and Portuguese traders. History City walls of Mrauk U Taunggyet Kingdom Although Arakan kings paid tribute to the Pagan dynasty, the South was mostly free of Pagan suzerainty and largely cut off from the rest of Burma. Separated from Pagan by the Arakan Mountains, Arakan developed more independently to other Burmese regions. its capital moved from Thaibeiktaung to Dinnyawadi to Vesali before the 11th century, and then to Pyinsa, Parin, and Hkrit in the 12th century, with the capital moving to Pyinsa again in 1180, and then Launggyet in 1237.Harvey 1925: 76 Arakan had close contact with Bengal, coming into full contact with it as it was expanding eastwards. Bengal captured Satgaon and later Sonargaon towards the beginning of the 14th century, and during the reign of King Minhti (1279-1374), Bengal invaded Arakan by sea, raiding the Hinya river at Chittagong.Akhtaruzzaman, Md. ‚ÄúPOLITICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN MEDIEVAL BENGAL AND ARAKAN.‚Äù Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, vol. 61, 2000, pp. 1081‚Äì1092., www.jstor.org/stable/44144423. Accessed 5 Feb. 2020. Following the collapse of Pagan power and the death of Minhti, Arakan fell into an interregnum, and constant raids were conducted by both the Burmese and the Talaing. The new king who took power in 1404, Narameikhla, was immediately ousted by the forces of the Burmese king Pyinsing Mengswa, who captured Launggyet and forced Narameikhla to flee to the court of the Sultanate of Bengal at Gour.Harvey 1925: 77Phayer 1883: 77 During Narameikhla's 24-year exile, Arakan became an extensive battleground for the Ava Kingdom and the Pegu Kingdom. The King of Ava installed his son-in-law on the throne of Arakan, bestowing him the title of Anoaraht√¢. Pegu forces later captured and executed him. The power struggle ended with R√¢j√¢dirit coming out on top, capturing Taunggyet and installing his own governor, who was in power until 1423. Reign of Narameikhla Following the death of Ahmed Shah in 1426, his son Nazir Shah took the throne of Bengal. After 24 years of exile, Narameikhla finally regained control of the Arakanese throne in 1430 with military assistance from Bengali commanders Wali Khan and Sindhi Khan. The Bengalis who came with him formed their own settlements in the region. Narameikhla ceded some territory to the Sultan of Bengal and recognised his sovereignty over the areas. In recognition of his kingdom's vassal status, the kings of Arakan received Islamic titles, despite being Buddhists, and legalised the use of Islamic gold dinar coins from Bengal within the kingdom. The kings compared themselves to Sultans and fashioned themselves after Mughal rulers. They also employed Muslims in prestigious positions within the royal administration. Narameikhla minted his own, with Burmese characters on one side and Persian characters on the other. Despite ruling parts of Bengal, it continued to remain a protectorate of the Sultan of Bengal up until 1531. Narameikhla founded the city of Mrauk U, which was declared the capital of the Arakanese kingdom in 1431. As the city grew, many Buddhist pagodas and temples were built. Several of them remain, and these are the main attraction of Mrauk-U. From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Mrauk U was the capital of the Arakan kingdom, frequently visited by foreign traders (including Portuguese and Dutch). The golden city of Mrauk U became known in Europe as a city of oriental splendor after Friar Sebastian Manrique visited the area in the early 17th century. Father Manrique's vivid account of the coronation of King Thiri Thudhamma in 1635 and about the Rakhine Court and intrigues of the Portuguese adventurers fire the imagination of later authors. The English author Maurice Collis who made Mrauk U and Rakhine famous after his book The Land of the Great Image: Being experiences of Friar Manrique in Arakan based its accounts on Friar Manrique' travels in Arakan. Independence from Bengal Routes in the Toungoo‚ÄìMrauk-U War Narameikhla was succeeded by his brother, Ali Khan (reigning 1434-59), who annexed Sandoway and Ramu in 1437 with the vassalage to Bengal becoming null in 1433 following the death of Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah. Ali Khan's successor, Basawpyu (Kalima Shah, named after his coins bearing the Kalima, reigning 1459-82) occupied Chittagong, a city that Arakan would hold onto until 1666, at the beginning of his reign.Phayre 1883: 78Harvey 1925: 140‚Äì141 Although Barbek Shah, the new Sultan of Bengal, allowed Bengal to falter,Phayre 1883: 78 Arakan remained subordinate to Bengal until 1531. Basawpyu was succeeded by his son Doalya, who launched a rebellion against him in 1482, taking his life.Phayre 1883: 79 A line of weak kings followed, although they managed to hold on to Chittagong. However, in 1531, Minbin took the throne, strengthening the fortifications of Mrauk U and fighting back against coastal raids by pirates. Minbin was responsible for the construction of the Shwedaung pagoda as well as the Shitthaung, Dukkanthein, and Lemyethna temples in Mrauk U.Harvey 1925: 77 During Minbin's reign, Arakan came under attack both from the north, from the coast, and from the east. In 1544, the armies of King Tabinshwehti of Burma invaded and took Sandoway, beginning the Toungoo‚ÄìMrauk-U War. However, he was unable to march further, and was held there for two years. Thus, he brought in Talaing and Shan fighters and revitalized his offensive, marching north to Mrauk U. However, once he reached the city, Tabinshwehti retreated, as he it was too well- defended and he did not want to besiege or blockade it. From the north came the Raja of Twipra, who marched as far as Ramu.Phayre 1883: 79-80 However, he was driven back, and upon the Arakanese reclamation of Chittagong, Minbin struck from production coins with his name that styled him as sultan. Minbin's reign ended in 1553.Harvey 1925: 77 Portuguese interference Down the line of kings came Minyazagyi (1593-1612). In 1597, he joined the First Toungoo Empire in its siege of Pegu and requested the aid of Portuguese captain Felipe de Brito to assist him in it.Harvey 1925: 78 Land levies and ships from Chittagong, and the city fell in 1599. de Brito was appointed governor of Syriam by Minyazagyi. However, he shook off Arakanese power over the region, and, supported by Goa, he pushed away the many attacks of Arakan. Minyazagyi took three years (1602-1605) to take Sandwip from Manuel de Mattos and Domingo Carvalho. From 1531-1629, Arakanese raiders and Portuguese pirates operated from havens along the coast of the kingdom and brought slaves in from Bengal to the kingdom. Following many raids into Bengal, the slave population increased in the 17th century as they were employed in a variety of industries in Arakan. Slaves included members of the Mughal nobility. A notable royal slave was Alaol, a renowned poet in the Arakanese court.Rizvi, S.N.H. (1965). \\"East Pakistan District Gazetteers\\" (PDF). Government of East Pakistan Services and General Administration Department (1): 84. Retrieved 22 November 2016. Some of them worked as Arabic, Bengali, and Persian scribes in the Arakanese courts, which, despite remaining mostly Buddhist, adopted Islamic fashions from the neighbouring Sultanate of Bengal. Arakan lost control of end of eastern bank of the Kaladan river in southeast Bengal after the Mughal conquest of Chittagong. In 1660, Prince Shah Shuja, the governor of Mughal Bengal and a claimant of the Peacock Throne, fled to Arakan with his family after being defeated by his brother Emperor Aurangzeb during the Battle of Khajwa. Shuja and his entourage arrived in Arakan on 26 August 1660. He was granted asylum by King Sanda Thudhamma. In December 1660, the Arakanese king confiscated Shuja's gold and jewelry, leading to an insurrection by the royal Mughal refugees. According to varying accounts, Shuja's family was killed by the Arakanese, while Shuja himself may have fled to a kingdom in Manipur. However, members of Shuja's entourage remained in Arakan and were recruited by the royal army, including as archers and court guards. They were king makers in Arakan until the Burmese conquest. The Arakanese continued their raids of Mughal Bengal. Dhaka was raided in 1625. The Mahamuni Buddha Image, which is now in Mandalay, was cast and venerated some 15 miles from Mrauk U where another Mahamuni Buddha Image flanked by two other Buddha images. Mrauk U can be easily reached via Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State. From Yangon there are daily flights to Sittwe and there are small private boats as well as larger public boats plying through the Kaladan river to Mrauk U. It is only 45 miles from Sittwe and the seacoast. To the east of the old city is the famous Kispanadi stream and far away the Lemro river. The city area used to have a network of canals. Mrauk U maintains a small archaeological Museum near Palace site, which is right in the centre of town. As a prominent capital Mrauk U was carefully built in a strategic location by levelling three small hills. The pagodas are strategically located on hilltops and serve as fortresses; indeed they are once used as such in times of enemy intrusion. There are moats, artificial lakes and canals and the whole area could be flooded to deter or repulse attackers. There are innumerable pagodas and Buddha images all over the old city and the surrounding hills. Some are still being used as places of worship today many in ruins, some of which are now being restored to their original splendor. Burmese conquest Konbaung Dynasty's conquest of Arakan in 1785, as many as 35,000 people of the Rakhine State fled to the neighbouring Chittagong region of British Bengal in 1799 to escape persecution by the Bamar and to seek protection under the British Raj.

The band have reunited sporadically for gigs since their initial break up, beginning in 2006. In 2015 there was suggestion of a possible new album from the band.http://www.leapsandboundsmusicfestival.com/artists/the-glory-box/ History The Glory Box were one of a number of promising Melbourne bands that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s that also included, amongst others, Underground Lovers, Ripe, Autohaze, The Fauves, The Killjoys, The Hollowmen, Sea Stories and Pray TV. The Glory Box were: Matt Aston (vocals), Daniel Haskell (bass), Robert Caflisch (drums), Will Johnston (guitarist), Kieran Doolan (guitar). Doolan left the band in May 1992 and was replaced on guitar by Eugene Biankin. Their debut 7\\" vinyl single \\"Raining Embers/My Friend\\" was released in March 1989 on Mouth & Vinnie Records. This was followed by another 7\\" vinyl single \\"Regrets/One Picture\\", also released on Mouth & Vinnie Records in December 1989 as part of a single-giveaway at the Punters Club. \\"Regrets'\\"was also re-recorded for the 5 track 'Donkey' EP, which was released on Polyester Records in September 1990 on 12\\" vinyl only. Another 7\\" vinyl single 'Precipice/Day After Day' was released on Shock Records in April 1991 as part of a single-giveaway gig at The Tote Hotel. Their debut 11 track album Fudgeland was released in 1991 on Shock Records. The track \\"House on the Hill\\" was released from the album as a 4 track 7\\" vinyl single, which also included the tracks \\"Oh No\\" from the Fudgeland album, as well as 'Intersect' and 'Cut' from the 'Donkey' EP. A demo version of \\"House on the Hill\\" also appeared on the Shocktober sampler CD, released by Shock Records in October 1991. A compilation CD This Is The Glory Box was released on Shock Records in 1991 and included all of the singles and the 'Donkey' EP tracks, as well as the demo version of \\"House on the Hill\\" from the Shocktober sampler CD. 'Raining Embers/Regrets' were released together as a 7\\" inch vinyl single by English record label Tea Time Records in February 1991. In 1992 The Glory Box featured on a CD called Dress Ups' (Shock Records) with other Melbourne bands The Fauves and Pray TV, with each band performing a track from the others repertoire, as well as contributing one original track. An EP called 'Strip-O-Rama' was released on Shock Records in May 1993. The title track was an original, with an additional 4 tracks of Bee Gees covers. The Glory Box sound was one of jangly guitar pop and rock. Their sound was often compared to English band The Wedding Present from the same period. Song structure was varied from straightforward 3-chord power pop (see the track 'Regrets'), to a more complicated and melancholy style, highlighted on the track \\"Intersect\\" from the 'Donkey' EP. Lyrics focussed on themes such as relationships, envy and self-assessment. Other tracks never released but often played live by The Glory Box included the energetic \\"Crash & Burn\\" and \\"Swan\\". The band regularly played the track \\"Mr Pharmacist\\" by 1960's San Francisco band The Other Half. On the Fudgeland LP the track 'The Other's Way' (sung by Doolan) was a cover, originally by the 1980s New Zealand band The DoubleHappys. The Glory Box were one of the first Melbourne bands to have a T-shirt launch gig, a concept that proved popular in the early 1990s in Melbourne. The T-shirt launch was held at The Tote Hotel on 1 December 1990, with support bands Underground Lovers and the Melbourne indie-pop band Glass. The band broke up with a farewell show at The Lounge in Melbourne on 31 July 1993.

In November 2006 they played a gig (with Autohaze and Mark Murphy from Ripe) at The Tote Hotel as part of the 'Long Player' series, which featured 1990's bands playing one of their albums from start to finish, similar to the 'Don't Look Back' concept. They played all of 'Fudgeland' and some of the singles and tracks off the 'Donkey' EP. On 28 November 2010 they played at a Punters Club reunion gig at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne, with other notable early 1990s Melbourne bands such as Frente!, The Hollowmen and The Fauves.

Long after independence, the first revenue stamps printed by the United States government were issued in the midst of the American Civil War, prompted by the urgent need to raise revenue to pay for the great costs it incurred. After the war ended however, revenue stamps and the taxes they represented still continued. Revenue stamps served to pay tax duties on items that came under two main categories, Proprietary and Documentary. Proprietary stamps paid tax duties on goods like alcohol and tobacco, and were also used for various services, while Documentary stamps paid duties on legal documents, mortgage deeds, stocks and a fair number of other legal dealings. Proprietary and Documentary stamps often bore these respective designations, while in several of the issues they shared the same designs, sometimes with minor variations. Beginning in 1862 the first revenue stamps were issued, and would continue to be used for another hundred years and more. For the first twelve years George Washington was the only subject featured on U.S. revenue stamps, when in 1875 an allegorical figure of Liberty finally appeared. Revenue stamps were printed in many varieties and denominations and are widely sought after by collectors and historians. Revenue stamps were finally discontinued on December 31, 1967. History of revenue stamp usage proof copy of a stamp prepared for the 1765 Stamp Act The first revenue stamps appeared in the years leading up to the American Revolution as a result of the 1765 Stamp Act, the taxes of which were not well received by the colonists of the day. These were the British colonial issues and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on specially prepared stamped paper produced in London which carried an embossed revenue stamp. Retrieved 15 December 2010 Civil War era, first issue In August 1862, while the American Civil War was being waged, the United States (Union) government began taxing a variety of goods, services and legal dealings. To confirm that taxes were paid a 'revenue stamp' was purchased and appropriately affixed to the taxable item, which would in turn pay the tax duty involved. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue took bids for the printing and production of the first U.S. revenue stamps in an effort to raise revenue for the great costs of the war.Smithsonian National Postal Museum, articleLinn's Stamp News article: Miller, 2014 The Department of Internal Revenue awarded Butler & Carpenter of Philadelphia the printing contract who were paid $19,080 to produce one hundred and six printing plates, including the rolls, dies and all material necessary to maintain stamp production. Toppan, Deats & Holland, 1899, pp. 6‚Äì7 Butler & Carpenter soon began producing the first revenue stamps which were issued for use beginning Oct. 1, 1862.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, p. 453 For reasons unknown the bill from Butler & Carpenter was never settled by the U.S. government until some years later, but not after Butler and Carpenter wrote and appealed numerous times to the commissioner of Internal Revenue, Hon. J.J. Lewis, about the matter. Because of the long wait involved one of the major points of contention was the appreciable amount of increase for materials between the time the agreement was made and when the bill was finally settled. The new stamps were printed in several colors and depicted a portrait of George Washington on all thirty denominations from one-cent to $200. The engraved image of Washington was modeled after a painting by Gilbert Stuart.McKinney, BSA Journal, 1962 The first issues were printed on hard brittle paper and later printed on soft woven paper of varying thicknesses. Colors were generally dull for stamps printed before 1868. The stamps were issued in sheets perforated with 12 gauge perforations or 'imperforate', i.e.solid sheets with no perforations. Washington remained the only figure on the dozens of varieties issued up until 1874.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, pp. 453‚Äì460 The new revenue stamps were used to pay tax on proprietary items such as playing cards, patent medicines and luxuries, and for various legal documents, stocks, transactions and various legal services. The cancellation of these stamps were usually done in pen and ink, while hand stamped cancellations were seldomly used and subsequently are more rare. When the Civil War ended it did not mean an end to revenue taxes as the federal government still had not paid the $2.7 billion debt it had acquired until 1883, at which time it finally repealed the excise tax. Three distinct revenue stamp series were produced to pay the taxes during that twenty one-year period. Playing card revenue stamps, often used for the photograph tax Among the more notable instances of tax stamp usage occurred in the photography trade. As the Civil War progressed, the demand for photographs of family members, soldiers going off to war and returning war heroes increased dramatically, but not without the notice from the Federal government who saw the advent as an opportunity to raise much needed revenue for the war. On August 1, 1864 the Internal Revenue department passed a 'photograph tax' requiring photographers to pay a tax on the sale of their photographs. By 1864 there were no 'photography tax' stamps issued, so other stamps were substituted, typically, the proprietary or playing card revenue stamps was used, usually affixed to the back of the photograph. Already burdened with high overhead costs and scarcity of materials because of the war, large photograph companies organized and petitioned Congress, complaining that they were shouldering too much of the tax burden placed on the public. After exactly two years their constant efforts resulted in the tax being repealed on August 1, 1866.Baryla, 2010, Frame 1, p. 1 Several other widely used products, such as cotton, tobacco and alcohol, were also charged a proprietary tax which appreciably contributed to the revenues generated.Baryla, 2010, Frame 1, p. 2 right Foreign Exchange, 1862 issue First issue design types  The first series of revenue stamps have two distinctive design types with each stamp designating the tax 'duty'. Designs for denominations 1-cent through 20-cents were simple, bearing a portrait of George Washington, while stamps with denominations 25-cents through 1-dollar are larger and have a more elaborate design and also designate the tax duty in a lower banner. Stamps with denominations of $1.30 were used to pay the tax duty for foreign exchange only, $1.50 for Inland exchange only while the stamps with denominations of $1.60 and $1.90 were for Foreign exchange only and oddly bear no duty designations in the stamp design. Denominations of 2-dollars through 10-dollars have tax duties designated in the lower circular banner surrounding Washington's portrait. Denominations of 15-dollars through 50-dollars have tax duties designated in the right side of the circular banner surrounding the portrait. The design used for the 1-cent denomination is unique and is not used for any other denomination.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, pp. 453, 457‚Äì459 Various tax duties were only served by certain revenue stamps as some duties were only found on lower or higher denomination revenue stamps as the case may be. For example, revenue stamps with a designation for Playing cards occur only on denominations of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cents, while the 25-cent denomination revenue stamp is the only one whose designation specifies Bond. A specialized stamp catalog is needed to see the different occurrences of tax- designation to denomination combinations.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, pp. 457‚Äì459 Second issue  The second issue of revenue stamps were Documentary stamps and issued in 1871. After the Internal Revenue received many reports of the fraudulent re-use of revenue stamps, typically with cancellation ink washed or otherwise removed from the face of the stamp,Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, pp. 458‚Äì460 a letter of May 31, 1867 from government officials in Wall Street was sent to Internal Revenue commissioner E.A. Rollins expressing the concern that \\"The U.S. government loses thousands of dollars daily by stamps being used a second time.\\" The ordinary stamps in use at this time did not receive the cancellation ink very well, unless it was heavily applied.Toppan, Deats & Holland, 1899, pp. 8, 15‚Äì16 The letter advised that all stamps be printed in a pale yellow color. This particular suggestion however was not taken up by Butler & Carpenter, but instead, after a period of experimentation, they responded to the problem by producing stamps of a lighter shade and on a paper that more readily absorbed cancellation ink. The Internal revenue was frequently sending stamps suspected of having cancellation ink washed to the engravers and printers for inspection to determine if they had been tampered with.Toppan, Deats & Holland, 1899, p. 65 The new paper was finally employed in stamp production in early 1869 and by 1871 a second series of stamps were issued, printed on a special patented \\"chameleon\\" paper containing silk fibers which can be seen in the paper with the naked eye. Still produced by Butler & Carpenter of Philadelphia, the entire second series, with the exception of the 200-dollar issue, were printed in the same bi-color combination, with the portrait of Washington printed in black and with the frame work in blue with various ornate and elaborate designs, popular during that period. ;\\"Persian rug\\" stamps \\"Small Persian rug\\", $200 \\"Large Persian rug\\", $500 The highest values in the second issue of revenue stamps are 200-dollar (left) and the 500-dollar (right) stamps and are commonly referred to by collectors as the Small and Large Persian rug revenue stamps respectively, which are considered by many to be among the most colorful and elaborately engraved stamps in all of philately. Both the 200 and 500-dollar stamps were printed in very limited quantities. The 200-dollar small Persian Rug had a printing of 446 copies, with approximately 125 known surviving examples. The stamps were printed one to a 'sheet', with margins on all four sides with inscriptions on the two side margins. The only surviving full sheet of the small Persian rug, was used to pay tax duties on the will of Erastus Corning, Sr. in 1872. The 500-dollar large Persian rug is indeed larger, measuring by 4 inches with only 204 stamps of this denomination ever issued. Because of their relatively large sizes and the subsequent large number of perforations on each stamp, and the fact that they were used on documents which were typically folded across the stamps, most examples exist with some sort of flaw(s) about the stamp paper. Printed by the Carpenter Printing company of Philadelphia, a 5,000-dollar design was also proposed and a trial color essay was printed, but it was never issued for revenue use so there only exists a die proof.Siegel Auction Galleries, NYSwain, essay, 2012 Alcohol revenue stamps  Taxes were commonly levied on alcohol and tobacco products and a variety of such stamps were printed for this purpose. Typically, the stamp would be affixed to a given product when the taxes were paid in such a way as to seal a given container, where upon opening, the stamp would be damaged. For example, revenue stamps for beer tax were issued to brewers in sheet form, where an individual stamp was cut from it and used as a seal over the opening in a barrel of beer. To access the beer the stamp would have to be punctured, thus prohibiting its reuse. thumb Third issue  Because the second issue of revenue stamps were all printed in the same blue and black colors they were often difficult to distinguish at a glance by Internal Revenue employees. Subsequently, a third issue of stamps with similar designs and some variations as the second issue but with distinctive colors assigned to the various denominations was released between 1871 and 1872. Production of the third issue employed many of the same printing plates, engraved by J.R. Carpenter of Philadelphia, and were printed on the same special \\"chameleon\\" paper with silk fibers used in the printing of the second issue, with perf' 12 perforations. Unlike many of the stamps in the second issue, the third issue does not designate any duty type in the stamp designs. Double transfers and inverted centers occur in nearly all the different denomination designs.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, p. 460 By 1875 the Internal Revenue awarded the contract to print for revenue stamps to the National Bank Note Company who prepared a second series of proprietary stamps. The new revenue stamps are commonly referred to as the \\"second proprietary issue,\\" and occur in 1-cent, 2-cent, 3-cent, 4-cent, 5-cent, and 6-cent denominations. Use of revenue stamps to pay proprietary taxes ended on July 1, 1883. Liberty issue of 1875 In 1875, the Internal revenue department issued a 2-cent revenue, depicting an allegory of Liberty. Printing of this issue continued into 1878. This was the first U.S. Revenue stamp to be issued that did not bear the portrait of George Washington. The Liberty issue was printed on silk bluish paper. Two types of perforations were added, standard perforations with punctured holes, and rouletted. Stamps produced in 1878 were printed on double-lined watermarked paper.Scotts Specialized Catalogue, 1982, p.460 Quantities printed for this issue were great, totaling 228,351,689 stamps, which include both standard and rouletted perforations. The quantities of stamps issued with each type of perforation are not known.Toppan, Deats & Holland, 1899, p. 105 Overprints of 1898 On June 13, 1898, Congress passed the War Revenue Act of 1898 to provide badly needed funding for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The law was to become effective on July 1, 1898, leaving only seventeen days to produce the badly needed revenue stamps. In anticipation of the law's passage the Bureau of Engraving and Printing had already commenced work on the dies and printing plates for the new revenue stamps, however they were unable to issue the stamps when the law went into effect. To meet the demand for revenue stamps, existing stocks of standard postage stamps (issued in 1895‚Äì1898) were overprinted with the initials I.R. (i.e., Internal Revenue) for use as revenue stamps. Initials are faint on issues with denominations of 8, 10 and 15-cents.Siegel Auction Galleries, NY, 2014 {style=\\"margin:auto\\" Franklin overprint 1c, 1898 issue Washington overprint, 2c, 1898 issue Sherman overprint, 15c, 1895 issue Webster overprint, 10c, 1898 issue Clay overprint, 15c, 1898 issue } Trans-Mississippi issue overprinted IR Because of shortages of revenue stamps two shipping firms operating along the Erie Canal used the existing 1c Trans-Mississippi stamp issue which was approved by the Federal District Revenue Collector who commissioned the Purvis Printing Company to do the overprinting. They were ordered by L. H. Chapman of the Chapman Steamboat Line, which operated freight-carrying steamboats along the Erie Canal, making stops at Syracuse, Utica, Little Falls and Fort Plain. Only 250 stamps were produced. In addition 250 were printed reading \\"I.R./P.I.D. & Son\\", for P.I. Daprix & Son, which served different ports along the same waterway. In each case five panes of 50 stamps were overprinted with the initials I.R..Lester, ASDA essay Issues of 1898 Common use of Documentary Revenue stamps (upper left) affixed to stock certificate In the continuation of providing funding for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Congress authorized a tax on a wide range of goods and services including various alcohol and tobacco products, tea and other amusements and also on various legal and business transactions (such as Stock certificates, bills of lading, manifests, and marine insurance). To pay these tax duties revenue tax stamps were purchased and affixed to the taxable item or respective certificate.Garbade, 2012, p. 29.Jewell, 2005p. 1895; Swaine, p. 653; Pratt, p. 117 There are seventeen stamps in this issue which occur in denominations ranging from ¬Ω-cent to 50-dollars which were printed on double lined watermarked paper. Two types of perforations were used: Rouletted perforations and 'hyphen' shaped perforations. Numerous double transfers occur (doubled image) in this issue.Scotts, 1982, p.461 *Issues occur with denominations from -cent to 80-cents depict a battleship *Issues occur with denominations from 1-dollar to 50-dollars depicting a standing allegorical figure of Commerce. Design is modification of one used in Newspapers periodicals of 1875 and 1895. A second printing was issued in 1900 with a large numeral 1 overprint, occurring in two types  solid numeral and ornate numeral.Scotts, 1982, p. 462 Documentary series of 1898 The three Documentary stamps issued in the 1898 series (which were actually issued in 1899) feature the portraits of John Marshall, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, each bearing the inscription Series of 1898. These three designs were also used in the 1914, 1917 printings and much later in 1940 issues, with slight modifications in the design. i.e.The inscription Series of 1898 was removed. As an added security measure each of these high value stamps was given its own unique serial number.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, pp. 462-64 Produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing the issues of 1898 were printed on white wove paper and watermarked with the initials U.S.I.R. (i.e. United States Internal revenue) in block capital letters. The stamps were separated by rouletted perforations.Toppan, Deats & Holland, 1899, p. 109 The issues of 1917 and 1940 were also printed on double lined watermarked paper with standard gauge 12 perforations.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, p. 464 {style=\\"margin:auto\\" Marshall revenue, $100 1899 issue Hamilton revenue, $500 1899 issue Madison revenue, $1000 1899 issue Hamilton revenue $500 1917 issue } Issues of 1914 Issues of 1914 were printed in two basic design types. Lower denominations (¬Ω-cent through 80-cents) printed with denomination encircled; Higher denominations (1-dollar through 50-dollars) printed with allegory of freedom in profile. Denominations from ¬Ω-cent to 80-cents were printed on both single line and double lined watermarked paper, while higher denominations were printed on double lined watermarked paper only.Scotts Specialized stamp catalog, 1982, pp. 462-63 Issues of 1917‚Äì1933 1917 issues Lower denominations range from 1-cent to 80-cents; Higher denominations range from 1-dollar to 1,000-dollars. Printed on single line watermarked paper, with gauge 10 perforations. Issues of the 1940s and 1950s During the period from 1940 to 1958 the Department of Internal Revenue released several hundred, Documentary, revenue stamps in three basic designs with denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 10,000-dollars and with a variety of different portraits of notable statesmen, each denomination of stamp bearing a different portrait. Almost all of the issues of this period were printed in \\"carmine\\" red. The higher denominations of 30-dollars to 10,000-dollars bore a unique serial number as an added security measure. A few reprints from 1917 were also issued during this period.Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue, 1982, pp. 464-468 {style=\\"margin:0.5em auto\\" + Three design types : Design at left used for denominations 1-cent to 80-cents; Center, 1-dollar to 20-dollars; Right, 30-dollars to 10,000-dollars, with serial numbers.  } John Henry Co., N.Y., 1862 Private die proprietary stamps San Francisco Percussion Match Co 12c 1872 issue After the tax laws were passed in 1862, private proprietors were allowed to furnish their own stamps, subject to the approval of the Internal Revenue and subsequently were granted a discount on the taxes paid for the goods they sold. Private stamps offered the advantage of having the proprietor's name depicted on the stamp. The proprietor paid the cost of engraving the die and the printing plates which in the beginning varied considerably. Some proprietors paid as little as $60 while others paid as much as $750. After June 1, 1863 a uniform cost of $350 was adopted for all dies with a couple of exceptions for large ones.Toppan, Deats & Holland, 1899, p. 119 Most of these stamps were printed by Butler & Carpenter of Philadelphia who also printed revenue stamps for the government. Since many stamps would be used to seal a container or packet they were often long in configuration and would be destroyed upon opening. Four types of paper were used to print private die proprietary stamps. They were printed on white, unwatermarked paper up until September, 1871, commonly referred to as \\"old paper.\\" Some of this paper contained sparsely scattered silk threads and is considered a minor variety or as \\"experimental silk.\\" The full \\"silk paper\\" contains numerous silk threads and was used between 1871 and 1878. \\"Pink paper\\" was also used for a brief period between 1877 and 1878. Watermarked paper, bearing the initials USIR was used from late 1877 to the end of the tax period in 1883. To help provide funding for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War the use of private stamps resumed again from July 1, 1898 until July 1, 1902. A variety of patent medicines, wines and other goods like perfumery and cosmetics were taxed, but only a comparatively small number of companies used private die stamps during this period. State revenues As well as Federal revenue stamps, a wide range of state revenues were issued by the various states for various purposes, ranging from sales tax to duck hunting permits. {style=\\"margin:0.5em auto\\" Massachusetts stock transfer tax stamp, 10c A 1936 Texas state revenue stamp for the tax on citrus fruit.

Like SHA-2, there are two variants differing in the word size. ChaCha operates on a 4√ó4 array of words. BLAKE repeatedly combines an 8-word hash value with 16 message words, truncating the ChaCha result to obtain the next hash value. BLAKE-256 and BLAKE-224 use 32-bit words and produce digest sizes of 256 bits and 224 bits, respectively, while BLAKE-512 and BLAKE-384 use 64-bit words and produce digest sizes of 512 bits and 384 bits, respectively. The BLAKE2 hash function, based on BLAKE, was announced in 2012. The BLAKE3 hash function, based on BLAKE2, was announced in 2020. History BLAKE was submitted to the NIST hash function competition by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luca Henzen, Willi Meier, and Raphael C.-W. Phan. In 2008, there were 51 entries. BLAKE made it to the final round consisting of five candidates but lost to Keccak in 2012, which was selected for the SHA-3 algorithm. Algorithm Like SHA-2, BLAKE comes in two variants: one that uses 32-bit words, used for computing hashes up to 256 bits long, and one that uses 64-bit words, used for computing hashes up to 512 bits long. The core block transformation combines 16 words of input with 16 working variables, but only 8 words (256 or 512 bits) are preserved between blocks. It uses a table of 16 constant words (the leading 512 or 1024 bits of the fractional part of œÄ), and a table of 10 16-element permutations: œÉ[0] = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 œÉ[1] = 14 10 4 8 9 15 13 6 1 12 0 2 11 7 5 3 œÉ[2] = 11 8 12 0 5 2 15 13 10 14 3 6 7 1 9 4 œÉ[3] = 7 9 3 1 13 12 11 14 2 6 5 10 4 0 15 8 œÉ[4] = 9 0 5 7 2 4 10 15 14 1 11 12 6 8 3 13 œÉ[5] = 2 12 6 10 0 11 8 3 4 13 7 5 15 14 1 9 œÉ[6] = 12 5 1 15 14 13 4 10 0 7 6 3 9 2 8 11 œÉ[7] = 13 11 7 14 12 1 3 9 5 0 15 4 8 6 2 10 œÉ[8] = 6 15 14 9 11 3 0 8 12 2 13 7 1 4 10 5 œÉ[9] = 10 2 8 4 7 6 1 5 15 11 9 14 3 12 13 0 The core operation, equivalent to ChaCha's quarter round, operates on a 4-word column or diagonal \`a b c d\`, which is combined with 2 words of message \`m[]\` and two constant words \`n[]\`. It is performed 8 times per full round: j ‚Üê œÉ[r%10][2√ói] // Index computations k ‚Üê œÉ[r%10][2√ói+1] a ‚Üê a + b + (m[j] ‚äï n[k]) // Step 1 (with input) d ‚Üê (d ‚äï a) >>> 16 c ‚Üê c + d // Step 2 (no input) b ‚Üê (b ‚äï c) >>> 12 a ‚Üê a + b + (m[k] ‚äï n[j]) // Step 3 (with input) d ‚Üê (d ‚äï a) >>> 8 c ‚Üê c + d // Step 4 (no input) b ‚Üê (b ‚äï c) >>> 7 In the above, \`r\` is the round number (0‚Äì13), and \`i\` varies from 0 to 7. The differences from the ChaCha quarter-round function are: * The addition of the message words has been added. * The rotation directions have been reversed. The 64-bit version (which does not exist in ChaCha) is identical, but the rotation amounts are 32, 25, 16 and 11, respectively, and the number of rounds is increased to 16. Tweaks Throughout the NIST hash function competition, entrants are permitted to \\"tweak\\" their algorithms to address issues that are discovered. Changes that have been made to BLAKE are: the number of rounds was increased from 10/14 to 14/16. This is to be more conservative about security while still being fast.

The design goal was to replace the widely used, but broken, MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms in applications requiring high performance in software. BLAKE2 was announced on December 21, 2012. A reference implementation is available under CC0, the OpenSSL License, and the Apache Public License 2.0. BLAKE2b is faster than MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3, on 64-bit x86-64 and ARM architectures. BLAKE2 provides security superior to SHA-2 and similar to that of SHA-3: immunity to length extension, indifferentiability from a random oracle, etc. BLAKE2 removes addition of constants to message words from BLAKE round function, changes two rotation constants, simplifies padding, adds parameter block that is XOR'ed with initialization vectors, and reduces the number of rounds from 16 to 12 for BLAKE2b (successor of BLAKE-512), and from 14 to 10 for BLAKE2s (successor of BLAKE-256). BLAKE2 supports keying, salting, personalization, and hash tree modes, and can output digests from 1 up to 64 bytes for BLAKE2b, or up to 32 bytes for BLAKE2s. There are also parallel versions designed for increased performance on multi-core processors; BLAKE2bp (4-way parallel) and BLAKE2sp (8-way parallel). BLAKE2X is a family of extensible-output functions (XOFs). Whereas BLAKE2 is limited to 64-byte digests, BLAKE2X allows for digests of up to 256 GiB. BLAKE2X is itself not an instance of a hash function, and must be based on an actual BLAKE2 instance. An example of a BLAKE2X instance could be BLAKE2Xb16MiB, which would be a BLAKE2X version based on BLAKE2b producing 16,777,216-byte digests (or exactly 16 MiB, hence the name of such an instance). BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s are specified in RFC 7693. Optional features using the parameter block (salting, personalized hashes, tree hashing, et cetera), are not specified, and thus neither is support for BLAKE2bp, BLAKE2sp, or BLAKE2X. Initialization vector BLAKE2b uses an initialization vector that is the same as the IV used by SHA-512. These values are transparently obtained by taking the first 64 bits of the fractional parts of the positive square roots of the first eight prime numbers.

It was announced on January 9th, 2020 at Real World Crypto. BLAKE3 is a single algorithm with many desirable features (parallelism, XOF, KDF, PRF and MAC), in contrast to BLAKE and BLAKE2, which are algorithm families with multiple variants. BLAKE3 is a Merkle tree, so it supports a practically unlimited degree of parallelism (both SIMD and threading). The official Rust and C implementations are dual-licensed as public domain (CC0) and the Apache License. BLAKE3 is designed to be as fast as possible. It is consistently a few times faster than BLAKE2. The BLAKE3 compression function is closely based on that of BLAKE2s, with the biggest difference being that the number of rounds is reduced from 10 to 7, a change based on the assumption that current cryptography is too conservative. In addition to providing parallelism, the Merkle tree format also allows for verified streaming (on-the-fly verifying) and incremental updates.

Its core idea is to connect multiple network devices through physical IRF ports and perform necessary configurations, and then these devices are virtualized into a distributed device. This virtualization technology realizes the cooperation, unified management, and non-stop maintenance of multiple devices. This technology follows some of the same general concepts as Cisco's VSS and vPC technologies. History This technology was originally developed by 3Com and released in 2003 as XRN (eXpandable Resilient Networking). When HP purchased 3Com in April 2010, HP renamed the technology to IRF. General overview Simplified topology and streamlined management. An IRF virtual device appears as a node on the network. You can log into it by connecting to any port of any member to manage all members of the IRF virtual device. * Simple network operation. Various control protocols running on different member devices as if they are running on one device. For example, routing protocols calculate the routes of the IRF virtual device instead of calculating the routes of each member. This avoids a great number of protocol packet exchanges among the members, simplifies network operation, and shortens the convergence time during network flapping. In addition, this advantage of the IRF technology is not delivered by the common cluster technology, which only realizes the unified management of devices, and the devices in a cluster operate as independent nodes. * Low cost. The IRF technology creates an IRF virtual device from multiple low-end devices, and thus the IRF virtual device has a higher port density and bandwidth and costs lower than using high-end devices. * Powerful network expansion capability. By adding member devices, the number of IRF ports, network bandwidth, and processing capability of the IRF virtual device can be easily expanded. * Protecting investment. Users only need to add new devices rather than replacing the original ones when upgrading a network because of the powerful network expansion capability of the IRF virtual device. * High reliability. IRF provides both link and node redundancy. An IRF virtual device comprises multiple member devices that operate in 1:N redundancy: the master runs, manages and maintains the IRF virtual device, whereas the slaves process services as well as functioning as the backups. As soon as the master fails, the IRF virtual device immediately elects a new master to prevent service interruption. In addition, you can aggregate both IRF links of members and the links between the IRF virtual device and its upper or lower layer devices. * High resiliency. You can increase the bandwidth and processing capability of an IRF virtual device simply by adding member devices. Each member device has its own CPU and they independently process and forward protocol packets. * Diversified functions. IRF provides all features supported by a switch, such as IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, security features, OAA cards, high availability, which can run effectively and stably on the IRF virtual device, and thus expands the application of IRF virtual devices. * Comprehensive product support. An IRF virtual device can be created from box-type devices or chassis-type distributed devices. * Only devices of the same series can form an IRF. Companies currently using this technology The only companies that use this technology are Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE, formerly Hewlett-Packard) and H3C (also HPE, formerly 3Comhttp://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press- release.html?id=342187#.VcI8lLOqpBc).

It consists of a number of cars represented by points on a lattice with a random starting position, where each car may be one of two types: those that only move downwards (shown as blue in this article), and those that only move towards the right (shown as red in this article). The two types of cars take turns to move. During each turn, all the cars for the corresponding type advance by one step if they are not blocked by another car. It may be considered the two-dimensional analogue of the simpler Rule 184 model. It is possibly the simplest system exhibiting phase transitions and self-organization. History The Biham‚ÄìMiddleton‚ÄìLevine traffic model was first formulated by Ofer Biham, A. Alan Middleton, and Dov Levine in 1992. Biham et al found that as the density of traffic increased, the steady-state flow of traffic suddenly went from smooth flow to a complete jam. In 2005, Raissa D'Souza found that for some traffic densities, there is an intermediate phase characterized by periodic arrangements of jams and smooth flow. In the same year, Angel, Holroyd and Martin were the first to rigorously prove that for densities close to one, the system will always jam. Later, in 2006, Tim Austin and Itai Benjamini found that for a square lattice of side N, the model will always self-organize to reach full speed if there are fewer than N/2 cars. Lattice space The fundamental polygon of the torus, on which the cars move The cars are typically placed on a square lattice that is topologically equivalent to a torus: that is, cars that move off the right edge would reappear on the left edge; and cars that move off the bottom edge would reappear on the top edge. There has also been research in rectangular lattices instead of square ones. For rectangles with coprime dimensions, the intermediate states are self-organized bands of jams and free-flow with detailed geometric structure, that repeat periodically in time. In non-coprime rectangles, the intermediate states are typically disordered rather than periodic. Phase transitions Despite the simplicity of the model, it has two highly distinguishable phases ‚Äì the jammed phase, and the free-flowing phase. For low numbers of cars, the system will usually organize itself to achieve a smooth flow of traffic. In contrast, if there is a high number of cars, the system will become jammed to the extent that no single car will move. Typically, in a square lattice, the transition density is when there are around 32% as many cars as there are possible spaces in the lattice. {A free-flowing phase observed on a 144√ó89 rectangular lattice with a traffic density of 28% A globally jammed phase observed on a 144√ó89 rectangular lattice with a traffic density of 60% } {A 512√ó512 lattice with density of 27% after 64000 iterations.

(The points are on the left side of the image.) } Intermediate phase The intermediate phase occurs close to the transition density, combining features from both the jammed and free-flowing phases. There are principally two intermediate phases ‚Äì disordered (which could be meta-stable) and periodic (which are provably stable). On rectangular lattices with coprime dimensions, only periodic orbits exist. In 2008 periodic intermediate phases were also observed in square lattices. Yet, on square lattices disordered intermediate phases are more frequently observed and tend to dominate densities close to the transition region. {A periodic intermediate phase observed on a 144√ó89 rectangular lattice with a traffic density of 38% A disordered intermediate phase observed on a 144√ó89 rectangular lattice with a traffic density of 39% } {A 512√ó512 lattice with density of 31% after 64000 iterations.

Mobility is defined as the number of cars that can move as a fraction of the total. } Rigorous analysis Despite the simplicity of the model, rigorous analysis is very nontrivial. Nonetheless, there have been mathematical proofs regarding the Biham‚ÄìMiddleton‚ÄìLevine traffic model. Proofs so far have been restricted to the extremes of traffic density. In 2005, Alexander Holroyd et al proved that for densities sufficiently close to one, the system will have no cars moving infinitely often. In 2006, Tim Austin and Itai Benjamini proved that the model will always reach the free-flowing phase if the number of cars is less than half the edge length for a square lattice. Non-orientable surfaces The model is typically studied on the orientable torus, but it is possible to implement the lattice on a Klein bottle. When the red cars reach the right edge, they reappear on the left edge except flipped vertically; the ones at the bottom are now at the top, and vice versa. More formally, for every y\\\\in \\\\lbrace 0, \\\\ldots , N-1\\\\rbrace, a red car exiting the site (N-1, y) would enter the site (0, N-y-1). It is also possible to implement it on the real projective plane. In addition to flipping the red cars, the same is done for the blue cars: for every x\\\\in \\\\lbrace 0, \\\\ldots, N-1 \\\\rbrace, a blue car exiting the site (x, N-1) would enter the site (N-x-1, 0). The behaviour of the system on the Klein bottle is much more similar to the one on the torus than the one on the real projective plane. For the Klein bottle setup, the mobility as a function of density starts to decrease slightly sooner than in the torus case, although the behaviour is similar for densities greater than the critical point. The mobility on the real projective plane decreases more gradually for densities from zero to the critical point. In the real projective plane, local jams may form at the corners of the lattice even though the rest of the lattice is free-flowing. Randomization A randomized variant of the BML traffic model, called BML-R, was studied in 2010. Under periodic boundaries, instead of updating all cars of the same colour at once during each step, the randomized model performs L^2 updates (where L is the side length of the presumably square lattice): each time, a random cell is selected and, if it contains a car, it is moved to the next cell if possible. In this case, the intermediate state observed in the usual BML traffic model does not exist, due to the non- deterministic nature of the randomized model; instead the transition from the jammed phase to the free flowing phase is sharp. Under open boundary conditions, instead of having cars that drive off one edge wrapping around the other side, new cars are added on the left and top edges with probability \\\\alpha and removed from the right and bottom edges \\\\beta respectively. In this case, the number of cars in the system can change over time, and local jams can cause the lattice to appear very different from the usual model, such as having coexistence of jams and free-flowing areas; containing large empty spaces; or containing mostly cars of one type.

Bne.eu. 31 July 2013. Links between Firtash, Paul Manafort and President Trump's administration continue to make headlines with reports that the extradition case will test US/Russia relations. In 2014, a special report by Reuters documented the Gazprom sold more than 20 billion cubic metres of gas at below market prices, enabling Firtash to make up to $3 billion during the deal. The report also notes the release of documents that prove Putin extended credit lines to Firtash of up to $11 billion which helped Firtash extend influence during the 2010 presidential election in Ukraine. Involvement in Trump-Ukraine scandal Living in Vienna, Austria, since 2014 Firtash has been resisting extradition to the United States on bribery and racketeering charges, and has sought to have the charges dropped. Firtash's attorneys obtained a September 2019 statement from Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was forced out under pressure from multiple countries and non-governmental organizations, as conveyed to Ukraine by then-vice president Joe Biden. Shokin asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm that employed Biden's son. President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who asserts he has \\"nothing to do with Firtash,\\" has promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Firtash is represented by Trump and Giuliani associates Joseph diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, having hired them on the recommendation of Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. The New York Times reported in November that Giuliani had directed Parnas to approach Firtash with the recommendation, with the proposition that Firtash could help to provide compromising information on Biden, which Parnas's attorney described was \\"part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter.\\" Shokin's statement notes that it was prepared \\"at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash.\\" Bloomberg News reported on October 18 that during the summer of 2019 Firtash associates began attempting to dig up dirt on the Bidens in an effort to solicit Giuliani's assistance with Firtash's legal matters, as well as hiring diGenova and Toensing in July. Bloomberg News also reported that its sources told them Giuliani's high-profile publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political quid pro quo. Later that day, The New York Times reported that weeks earlier, before his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were indicted, Giuliani met with officials with the criminal and fraud divisions of the Justice Department regarding what Giuliani characterized as a \\"very, very sensitive\\" foreign bribery case involving a client of his. The Times did not name whom the case involved, but shortly after publication of the story Giuliani told a reporter it was not Firtash. Two days later, the Justice Department stated its officials would not have met with Giuliani had they known his associates were under investigation by the SDNY. diGenova has said he has known attorney general Bill Barr for thirty years, as they both worked in the Reagan/Bush Justice Department. The Washington Post reported on October 22 that after they began representing Firtash, Toensing and diGenova secured a rare face-to-face meeting with Barr to argue the Firtash charges should be dropped. Prior to that mid-August meeting, Barr had been briefed in detail on the initial whistleblower complaint within the CIA that had been forwarded to the Justice Department, as well as on Giuliani's activities in Ukraine. Barr declined to intervene in the Firtash case. Firtash made his fortune brokering Ukrainian imports of natural gas from the Russian firm Gazprom. As vice president, Joe Biden had urged the Ukrainian government to eliminate middlemen such as Firtash from the country's natural gas industry, and to reduce the country's reliance on imports of Russian natural gas. Firtash denied involvement in collecting or financing damaging information on the Bidens. U.S. extradition request  On 13 March 2014, Austrian authorities arrested Firtash. U.S. law enforcement authorities sought to have Firtash extradited after a judge in Virginia issued a warrant for his arrest on bribery and other charges. A week later, Firtash was released on bail of million (¬£105m, $172m), the largest in Austrian history. He said: \\"thankfully, I have the utmost confidence in the Austrian judicial system and will use all legal means to prove my innocence\\". He said U.S. authorities were making allegations that were \\"completely absurd and unfounded\\". In April, a U.S. grand jury in Chicago indicted Firtash and five others under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act on charges that included bribery, racketeering, and money laundering. The charges centered on a $18.5 million bribe offered to government officials in India related to titanium mining licenses, with the minerals destined for sale to Chicago-based Boeing. Extradition of Firtash was cleared by the Austrian Supreme Court in June 2019 and by Austrian Minister of Justice Clemens Jabloner in July 2019. Extradition of Firtash has been suspended as a result of appeal by his defense team. Denial of U.S. extradition  The Vienna Regional Criminal Court rejected the U.S. request for the extradition of Firtash on 30 April 2015. Judge Christoph Bauer said that the request for extradition was \\"politically motivated\\". Bauer said that in the year since Firtash's arrest in Vienna, the U.S. authorities had not provided sufficient evidence that Firtash paid bribes in India, and in particular had not provided witness statements in support of its assertions. During the proceedings, Bauer had said that he did not doubt the veracity of the Americans' witnesses so much as whether they existed at all. A New York Times reporter described the decision as a \\"scathing rebuke of the Justice and State Departments\\", reflecting the diminished credibility of the United States authorities in the eyes of a European ally. Attempted return to Ukraine On 25 November 2015, German media reported that Firtash could return to Ukraine and participate in the FEU on 2 December. On 26 November, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry of Ukraine, Artem Shevchenko, said that the Interior Ministry had no criminal proceedings against Firtash, but there was a proceeding for the Ostchem group in which he was summoned as a witness. On 28 November 2015, the head of the Ukrainian airspace administration instructed that airspace be closed to private aircraft, to prevent Firtash from returning. On 1 December, Firtash said that the Ukrainian government took unprecedented steps to disrupt his visit to Ukraine.  Court of Appeal ruling on U.S. extradition  On 21 February 2017, the High Regional Court of Vienna (Oberlandesgericht Wien) reviewed the appeal and ruled that it was allowed to extradite Firtash to the U.S. The final decision on the extradition was deferred to the Federal Minister of Justice of Austria. Judge Leo Levnaic- Iwanski noted that U.S. authorities had provided additional documentation since the lower court had ruled against them. Firtash faces up to 50 years in prison and the seizure of all his assets. Immediately following the verdict, Firtash was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant related to charges of money laundering. Detention on Spanish and American orders Vienna's Higher Regional Court issued its decision on 19 December, citing insufficient documentation linking Firtash to alleged money laundering and organized crime. A court in Vienna has decided against extraditing Ukrainian oligarch Dymitro Firtash from Austria to Spain, saying Madrid had not provided enough proof linking Firtash to alleged crimes. On 21 February 2017, a few minutes after the announcement of the High Court's decision, Austrian police detained Firtash at the courthouse on the basis of an EU arrest warrant issued by Spain. The Spanish warrant was issued as part of an investigation into money laundering. The prosecutor's office in Vienna detained Firtash for 48 hours to determine its course of action. On 23 February, Firtash was released from custody on the million bail deposited in 2014. However, that same day he was arrested and held in custody in connection with the U.S. extradition request. On 24 February, Vienna Regional Court dismissed the Vienna prosecutor's application to impose provisional detention pending surrender regarding the U.S. extradition case. The question where Firtash was to be extradited ‚Äì to Spain or the United States ‚Äì is in the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice of Austria, Wolfgang Brandstetter. In early September 2017, Yevhen Yenin, Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, noted that Firtash's return to the Ukraine was \\"an unrealistic event\\". Proceedings to hear extradition cases from the United States and Spain would be lengthy. Yenin also noted, \\"there is a political side to the case. If we consider the level of Firtash's defense, it includes Austria's former justice minister.\\" In September, anti-corruption groups including Human Rights Watch, proposed that Firtash be placed on the Magnitsky List and sanctioned by the United States government. Personal life He was married to his first wife Ludmila Grabovetskaya () and they have a daughter Ivanna () (b. 1988). He was married to his second wife, Maria Kalinovskaya (), from 2001 until 2006. His stepson, Sergei Kalinovsky (), fled Ukraine in September 2007 after he had a traffic accident on 30 May 2007 in which the driver, Vladimir Kulikovsky (), and the passenger, Anastasia Bronnikov (), of a parked vehicle were killed. Kalinovsky was charged in their deaths and is on the international wanted list. His current wife Lada Pavlovna Firtasha (), his daughter Anna () (b. 2005), and son Dmitri () (b. 2007) are all Russian citizens and, as of April 2016, they all reside in Moscow. His oldest daughter Ivanna, and his mother Maria are Ukrainian citizens. In 2005, through LM Holdings of Nice and later the Irish firm Morga Ltd, he acquired the Villa La Mauresque near Cap Ferrat, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the Cote d'Azur of France.

Gallup was built as the commercial \\"menhaden fisherman\\"-type steam fishing trawler Annie E. Gallup at Fall River, Massachusetts, in 1878. In 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired Annie E. Gallup from the Delaware Fish and Oil Company of Lewes, Delaware, for use as a minesweeper during World War I. The Navy originally intended to commission her under her full original name, but on 28 July 1917 General Order No. 314 specified that all section patrol vessels bearing compound names would be referred to by last name only. Accordingly, she was commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 15 August 1917 as USS Gallup (SP-694) with Lieutenant Bailey A. West, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the 4th Naval District, Gallup carried out minesweeping duties into the early weeks of 1918. At 1200 hours on 20 February 1918 Gallup, by then under the command of Ensign C. P. Berlin, USNRF, was anchored in the Harbor of Refuge at Lewes when a moderate northwest gale caused her to drag her anchor. The following morning, despite the fact that her engines were working at full power, Gallup ran aground, stern first, on the point of Cape Henlopen, Delaware, swinging around broadside to the beach. In response to her distress signals, United States Coast Guard crews from nearby lifesaving stations brought her complement ashore without loss of life. However, Gallup broke in two forward of her engine room and was declared a total loss. Gallup was stricken from the Navy List on 20 May 1918. References SP-694 Annie E.

MetPetDB is designed and built by a global community of metamorphic petrologists in collaboration with computer scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as part of the National Cyberinfrastructure Initiative and supported by the National Science Foundation. MetPetDB is unique in that it incorporates image data collected by a variety of techniques, e.g. photomicrographs, backscattered electron images (SEM), and X-ray maps collected by wavelength dispersive spectroscopy or energy dispersive spectroscopy.  Purpose  MetPetDB was built for the purpose of archiving published data and for storing new data for ready access to researchers and students in the petrologic community. This database facilitates the gathering of information for researchers beginning new projects and permits browsing and searching for data relating to anywhere on the globe. MetPetDB provides a platform for collaborative studies among researchers anywhere on the planet, serves as a portal for students beginning their studies of metamorphic geology, and acts as a repository of vast quantities of data being collected by researchers globally.  Design  The basic structure of MetPetDB is based on a geologic sample and derivative subsamples. Geochemical data are linked to subsamples and the minerals within them, while image data can relate to samples or subsamples. MetPetDB is designed to store the distinct spatial/textural context of mineral analysis that is a crucial to petrologic interpretation. A web-based user interface allows a user to become members and download their search results. Approved members may become contributors and upload data to catalogue and share with the public. More information about the data model and the design of the database is available on the MetPetDB Support Wiki.http://wiki.cs.rpi.edu/trac/metpetdb MetPetDB Support Wiki  Contents  The database houses a wide range of information available for samples from all over the globe to be grouped into two categories: (a) observations and measurements (e.g. mineral data, images, chemical analyses), for which robust data models already exist, and (b) interpretative results (e.g. P-T conditions, crystallization ages, cooling rates, etc.), which are conclusions based on the observational data. Development of a robust data model for interpretative data is currently underway as of December 2010. The database system is beginning to incorporate a number of tools for data analysis and calculation that adds considerable power to the researcher. MetPetDB differs from other Geochemistry relational databases (e.g. GEOROC, NAVDAT, PetDB) in that it incorporates unpublished data in addition to data published in peer- reviewed journals. The vast majority of data collected by metamorphic geologists is not presented in publication, and therefore a forum for sharing this data with the public is an objective of MetPetDB. Contributors to MetPetDB also have the ability to store private data and create projects, or collections of private, public, and published data for sharing and organization.

Located in a floodplain along the east bank of the Willamette River near Sellwood, the park is known for attracting a wide variety of birds. In 1988, the park was named Portland's first wildlife refuge, and in 2004, it was designated the city's first migratory bird park. Description The elongated park includes a shallow seasonal lake and wetland, open grassy areas, and mixed maple and oak woodlands, among other habitats. A hiking and biking path called the Springwater Corridor runs through the park parallel to the Willamette River. The corridor runs alongside the Oregon Pacific Railway tracks which can be seen on a berm next to the path. Slightly south of the refuge are Sellwood Park and Sellwood Riverfront Park. Oaks Amusement Park is to the west, near the river. To the east, the top of a bluff above the lake is mainly residential, though one of the buildings is a mausoleum and crematorium with a huge great blue heron mural (Portland Memorial Mausoleum Mural ) overlooking the wetlands. A hiking trail wraps around the east side of the lake beneath the bluff. A side trail connects the east trail with Sellwood Park. To the north are mixed woodlands, shrubs, and a few open fields, and a trail crossing the north section of the refuge links the Corridor to a parking lot at the top of the bluff. West of the north part of the refuge are two islands, East and Hardtack, that belong to the Ross Island group in the Willamette. Ross Island is the site of a heron rookery. History Before the Bottom became a park, the raised bed of the rail line had largely separated the wetlands from the river. The south part of the wetlands had been altered by a sanitary landfill that the city acquired in 1969 to prevent its development as industrial land. The city later filled the north end of the park with debris from construction of Interstate 405 through downtown Portland. The plan in the early 1970s was to fill the rest of the wetlands and to use the space for museums, perhaps a motocross course, and a gondola lift to transport visitors from the top of the bluff to the park. Public pressure from the Audubon Society of Portland, the Sellwood-Moreland Improvement League, and The Nature Conservancy helped persuade the city to stop filling the wetlands. In 1988, after many years of debate, officials designated Oaks Bottom as the first urban wildlife refuge in Portland. Since then, Friends of Oaks Bottom, a volunteer group, has helped the city's parks department with trail maintenance, habitat restoration, and information services. In 2004, the park was named the city's first migratory bird park. Portland was one of five cities to receive $50,000 grants from the US Fish and Wildlife Service to establish such parks. Thousands of migratory birds visit the refuge during their annual north-south flights. Flora and fauna Oregon-grape, a shrub found in Oaks Bottom As of 2010, more than 185 bird species have been recorded in the refuge including herons, egrets, hawks, osprey, shorebirds, gulls, terns, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, grebes, falcons, vultures, waterfowl, and many others. Vegetation, which varies from one part of the refuge to another, includes Oregon white oak, Pacific madrone, ash, and black locust trees; ferns, Oregon-grape, Scotch broom, and poison oak, as well as rushes, sedges, and other plants. Invasive species, gradually being replaced by physical removal and burning, include reed canary grass, purple loosestrife, Himalayan blackberry, and others. To regulate the flow of water into and out of the wetlands, the parks department adds or removes boards at a small dam near the railroad berm. The idea is to replicate conditions that existed when the wetlands were fully connected to the river. Part of the water in the wetlands comes from natural springs, and part of the water comes from the river, when it runs high in the winter. Beavers have at times foiled the plan by damming the small stream that carries water between the lake and the river. The parks department has foiled the rodents by running a perforated pipe through the beaver dam.

Early life Alfred was born in Utica, New York on January 23, 1819. He was the son of Sarah (n√©e Hitchcock) Van Santvoord (1786‚Äì1878) and Abraham Cornelius Van Santvoord (1784‚Äì1858), who had provided munitions during the War of 1812 to the troops of Captain Thomas Macdonough on Lake Champlain, and thus played a major role in the American victory at the Battle of Plattsburgh. After the war, Abram Van Santvoord became one of the first boatmen on the Erie Canal. His brother was Cornelius Van Santvoord. His father moved the family to Rochester, New York in 1821, and later to Albany, New York, then to Jersey City, New Jersey. Career The Peacemakers (1868) by George Peter Alexander Healy depicts William Tecumseh Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, and David Dixon Porter on board the River Queen, a steamboat owned by Alfred Van Santvoord. Following a common school education in Albany, Alfred Van Santvoord became a clerk for his father, and later obtained an interest in his father's business. Together, the Van Santvoords ran boats on the Erie Canal and the Hudson River. His father also had a joint interest with Daniel Drew and Isaac Newton in the People's Line, which ran passenger boat service on the Hudson River. After his father's death, Van Santvoord purchased a number of steamboats and launched the Albany Day Line, which also offered transportation to passengers. Van Santvoord also came to own several freight-towing boats, which eventually became the Hudson River Day Line. During the American Civil War, Van Santvoord chartered several of his boats to the Union. One of Van Santvoord's boats, the River Queen served as Major General Benjamin Franklin Butler's headquarters. The River Queen served as the site of the Hampton Roads Conference in 1865. President of the United States Abraham Lincoln traveled on the River Queen often during the Civil War. Although he never sought political office, after the Civil War, Van Santvoord was influential with Thurlow Weed. He was well known in business circles, and was a friend of William Henry Vanderbilt. Van Santvoord was one of the organizers of the Lincoln National Bank and the Lincoln Safe Deposit Company. He was a director of the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad, the Catskill Mountain Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway, and the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company. Upon his death, his son-in-law Eben Olcott became president of The Day Line. Personal life On January 22, 1852, Van Santvoord was married to the former Anna Margaret Townsend (1826‚Äì1890) of Albany. She was the daughter of Absalom Townsend and Elizabeth (n√©e Lansing) Townsend, and the granddaughter of Jacob Lansing and Anna (n√©e Quackenbush) Lansing. Together, they were the parents of five children, four of whom survived to adulthood, including: * Elizabeth Van Santvoord (1853‚Äì1854), who died young. * Charles Townsend Van Santvoord (1854‚Äì1895), a manager of the Hudson River Day Line who did not marry. * Katharine Lawrence Van Santvoord (1855‚Äì1934), who married Eben Erskine Olcott (1854‚Äì1929), a president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. * Zaidee Van Santvoord (1858‚Äì1943), who Rev.

Intensive efforts towards unification of employers organizations materialized in the unification congress of the Federation of Employers of Ukraine on November 29, 2011 where Mr. Dmytro Firtash was elected President of the Federation. FEU has become the most powerful organization representing Ukraine's industry and business. The Federation has become an active and effective factor of influence upon social and economic processes in the country having signed Memorandums of Understanding with the State Tax Service of Ukraine, State Customs Service of Ukraine and Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine and having established an ongoing dialog with the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.Business Promotion To Reduce Unemployment, Says Dmitry Firtash History At the founding congress of employers' organizations the Federation of Employers of Ukraine, composed of 14 regional employers' organizations, was founded on September 27, 2002. In January 2003 the Federation of Employers of Ukraine became a full member of the International Organization of Employers. In 2004, for the first time, the Federation became a signatory of the General Agreement for 2004 to 2005 on behalf of national associations of employers. Thus, the European practice of relationship between state, employers and trade unions was initiated. The FEU initiated development and adoption of the Decree of the President of Ukraine \\"On the development of social dialogue in Ukraine\\" under which the National Tripartite Social and Economic Council under the President of Ukraine was created in 2005. The Council aims at increasing of the role of employers' organizations and trade unions in economic and social policy shaping. The first step towards the consolidation of Ukrainian Employers was made in 2009. The FEU initiated establishment of the Joint Representative Body of employers at the national level. In Moscow, the FEU, as the most representative employers' organizations at the national level, signed an agreement on the establishment and membership in the International Coordinating Council of Employers Associations on April 15, 2010. The Council includes employers' organizations from 15 countries. The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Group DF Dmytro Firtash was elected the Head of the Joint Representative Body. The election officially launched the process of Ukrainian employers' unification. The Law of Ukraine \\"On Social Dialogue in Ukraine\\" was adopted due to the active participation of employers. By the Decree of the President of Ukraine on implementation of the Law of Ukraine \\"On Social Dialogue in Ukraine\\" in 2011 the National Tripartite Social and Economic Council was created; Dmytro Firtash, the Head of the Joint Representative Body, became the Co-Chair of the council from employers' side. The FEU was recognized as a representative at the national level. This has given the Federation the legal right to participate in collective negotiations on the General Agreement, to delegate representatives to NTSEC, to funds of compulsory state social insurance and other constituents of the social dialogue and participation in international events. November 29, 2011 ‚Äì the historic event for business in Ukraine took place in Kiev - the Unification Congress of the Federation of Employers of Ukraine was held. The majority of national employers' organizations in Ukraine became part of the FEU. Thus has been created the largest nationwide organization of employers in the history of Ukraine.

Early examples of database applications were accounting systems and airline reservations systems, such as SABRE, developed starting in 1957. A characteristic of modern database applications is that they facilitate simultaneous updates and queries from multiple users. Systems in the 1970s might have accomplished this by having each user in front of a 3270 terminal to a mainframe computer. By the mid-1980s it was becoming more common to give each user a personal computer and have a program running on that PC that is connected to a database server. Information would be pulled from the database, transmitted over a network, and then arranged, graphed, or otherwise formatted by the program running on the PC. Starting in the mid-1990s it became more common to build database applications with a Web interface. Rather than develop custom software to run on a user's PC, the user would use the same Web browser program for every application. A database application with a Web interface had the advantage that it could be used on devices of different sizes, with different hardware, and with different operating systems. Examples of early database applications with Web interfaces include amazon.com, which used the Oracle relational database management system, the photo.net online community, whose implementation on top of Oracle was described in the book Database-Backed Web Sites (Ziff-Davis Press; May 1997), and eBay, also running Oracle.eBay's Massive Oracle Database Electronic medical records are referred to on emrexperts.com,EMR Experts in December 2010, as \\"a software database application\\". A 2005 O'Reilly book uses the term in its title: Database Applications and the Web. Some of the most complex database applications remain accounting systems, such as SAP, which may contain thousands of tables in only a single module.Oracle SAP Administration by Donald Burleson, Chapter 1 Many of today's most widely used computer systems are database applications, for example, Facebook, which was built on top of MySQL. The etymology of the phrase \\"database application\\" comes from the practice of dividing computer software into systems programs, such as the operating system, compilers, the file system, and tools such as the database management system, and application programs, such as a payroll check processor. On a standard PC running Microsoft Windows, for example, the Windows operating system contains all of the systems programs while games, word processors, spreadsheet programs, photo editing programs, etc. would be application programs. As \\"application\\" is short for \\"application program\\", \\"database application\\" is short for \\"database application program\\". Not every program that uses a database would typically be considered a \\"database application\\". For example, many physics experiments, e.g., the Large Hadron Collider,Large Hadron Collider as Massive Grid Computer generate massive data sets that programs subsequently analyze. The data sets constitute a \\"database\\", though they are not typically managed with a standard relational database management system. The computer programs that analyze the data are primarily developed to answer hypotheses, not to put information back into the database and therefore the overall program would not be called a \\"database application\\".

Nashandi was Namibia's ambassador to Scandinavian countries as well as the former High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Nashandi was removed from the SWAPO list for the 2009 general election because she had not registered to vote, a requirement under Namibian law. Nashandi is currently Namibian ambassador to the United States of America since 2019. Early life and education Nashandi was born on 12 October 1959 in the village of Ompundja in Oshana Region. As a refugee in 1978, she survived the Battle of Cassinga, a South African airborne attack on SWAPO across the border in Angola. She later received military training and joined the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), SWAPO's armed wing during the Namibian War of Independence. Nashandi graduated with a Diploma in Youth and Development from University of Zambia in 1983 and earned a master's degree in Diplomatic Studies from the University of Westminster in 2002 while on a diplomatic posting. Career Following Namibia's independence in 1990, Nashandi served as Deputy Chief of Protocol in the State House of Namibia prior to her appointment to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Under-Secretary for Political and Economic Affairs. From 1995‚Äì1999, she was Namibia's ambassador to Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. From 1999‚Äì2005, she became her country's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland. Nashandi has been the Acting Non-Executive Chairman of the Board at Trustco Group Holdings Limited since 2006. Trustco Group Holdings is a publicly traded company which provides micro-insurance and financial services. In November 2007, Nashandi was named to the board of directors of Africon, a Namibian engineering firm. At the time of her appointment, she was the only female on the board. Removal from party list At the September 2009 SWAPO party conference, Nashandi was placed 30th on the SWAPO party list for the coming elections for the National Assembly as one of President Hifikepunye Pohamba's ten personal nominations to that list. Because of the Public Service Act which states that public employees must either use vacation time or resign in order to get time off to run for public office, she was forced to resign from her position as Deputy Executive Director in the State House in order to run for the National Assembly. Nashandi had no vacation time to use and thus had to resign, but she was nearly guaranteed a place in the National Assembly due to her comfortable position on the SWAPO list. A month prior to the elections, Nashandi was removed from the SWAPO list when the Electoral Commission of Namibia discovered that Nashandi was not in possession of a valid voter's card and thus not a registered voter, a necessary condition to qualify for election to the National Assembly. Priscilla Beukes, at that time mayor of Mariental, took her place. Days after the removal, the former ambassador called her removal a \\"technical oversight\\"; she had not registered to vote in the 2004 general election because she was serving as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom at the time, and foreign missions did not conduct voter's registrations. It was widely expected that Nashandi would register to vote in the 2009 election and be appointed as one of the presidential additional six nominees for the National Assembly, but this did not occur. Private life Nashandi is married to a lieutenant colonel in the Namibian Defence Force, who is based in Otavi.

There has been controversy over the code, mostly centered on legal requirement for landowners in the Brazilian Amazon to maintain 80% of forests as legal reserves. This particular requirement has never been effectively implemented and implementation has again been delayed by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva until June 2011. The original law, passed in 1965, required only 50%. Neither this nor the 80% requirement have ever been prosecuted. This had been expected to change with harsher and criminal penalties to be introduced in 2009. Then President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva however, delayed this until the post election period in 2011, though Presidential Decree number 7029. While the measure has never been formally adopted into law it has been estimated that other Government policies have reduced logging from 21.5 thousand square kilometers in 2002 to 7.0 thousand in 2009. The code remains an enduring source of controversy for environmentalists and agriculturalists.Herbert, S.

According to environmentalists, the revised laws which are also known as the forest code, would give a rise to illegal deforestation. Whereas the farmers and the agricultural lobby welcomes the new law and suggest that it is going to be pivotal for the growth of agricultural sector of the Brazilian economy.

The park is named after pioneer Clinton Kelly, who settled the area east of the Willamette River in 1848. It is part of the Boring Lava Field, an extinct Plio-Pleistocene volcanic field that contains 32 cinder cones and shield volcanoes in or near Portland. The butte contains a now-sealed concrete bunker built as a civil defense emergency operations center in 1955‚Äì56 and later used for emergency dispatching.http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?a=384903&c;=53762 It appears in the film A Day Called X. Human history An aerial view of Kelly Butte, circa 1963. The photograph contains directional and road markings. In 1848, pioneer Clinton Kelly settled in the Willamette Valley in the area that is today southeast Portland. Present-day Clinton Street and Clinton Park bear his name. Clinton had five sons, one of whom, Plympton Kelly, established a farm on or near Kelly Butte. According to a 1906 obituary of Plympton Kelly, the farm was known as the Kelly Butte farm. In 1906, a prison and rock quarry opened on the site, where prisoners sentenced to hard labor would break rocks. In 1924, two corrections officers and a prisoner were killed when setting explosives at the quarry. The facility operated until the 1950s, providing cheap labor to crush rocks that were used for Portland's roads. After the prison and quarry closed, a civil defense bunker opened on the site in 1956, costing $670,000. The facility had 20,000 square feet and could house 250 people for two weeks. The facility contained backups of more than 3 million city documents in microfilm. The bunker was later retrofitted and served as an emergency services dispatch center from 1974 through 1994. In 1994 it was shuttered, and in 2006 it was permanently sealed off. From 1920 to 1960, Kelly Butte was home to a sixty-bed municipal hospital that isolated patients with infectious diseases. In 1968 a ten-million gallon water tank was built in its place. In 2010, the Portland City Council voted to replace the old water tank with a 25-million gallon underground reservoir. The new reservoir will serve as a replacement for Mount Tabor's three open-air reservoirs. Ecology In June 2003, Portland Parks and Recreation surveyed various parcels within the park. The resulting \\"vegetation unit summary\\" found of the natural area in good ecological health, in poor ecological health, and approximately in fair ecological health. In 2013, as part of a project to install a underground drinking water reservoir within the butte, work crews removed diseased trees, dead trees, and non-native invasive species. Invasive plant cover decreased botanic biodiversity, displaced native species, destroyed wildlife and bird habitat, and resulted in increased stormwater runoff as a consequence of decreased plant community complexity. One of the vegetation goals of the reservoir project is to reduce the level of invasive plants on the butte. After construction is complete, a re-vegetation plan calls for over 1,600 trees and 7,200 shrubs to be planted on the site. Many of the trees will be planted on the north side of the butte, while the south side will be replanted with an oak savanna. Ground cover plants such as grasses and wildflowers will be seeded in the area. Douglas fir and big leaf maple canopies on the west and north sides of the butte will remain largely intact. After construction is completed in 2015, plant life will continue to be monitored.
