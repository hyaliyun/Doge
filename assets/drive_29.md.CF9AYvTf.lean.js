From 1974 to 1979 he was a Labour Party Member of Parliament, but in the 1980s he joined the Social Democratic Party. Early life and studies Colin Barry Phipps was born in Britain on 23 July 1934 at Swansea. He attended Townfield Elementary School in Hayes, Middlesex, then Acton County Grammar School, and the Bishop Gore School, Swansea. From University College London he gained a BSc in Geology in 1955; and a PhD in Geology from the University of Birmingham in 1957. Career =Parliament= He stood in the Walthamstow East by-election in March 1969, and lost decisively. He served as Member of Parliament for Dudley West from February 1974 to 1979, when he stood down. His successes in the oil industry made him one of the more wealthy Labour MPs. He joined the Social Democratic Party in the 1980s, and unsuccessfully stood for election in Worcester at the 1983 general election, and Stafford in 1987. =Geology= From 1957 to 1964 Phipps worked with Shell in Venezuela, the Netherlands and the United States. In 1964, well before North Sea oil was known about, he left Shell and became an independent geology consultant and in 1973 he founded Clyde Petroleum, which had many involvements in North Sea oil. While working with this company he was also an MP from 1974 to 1979. He became the company's Chief Executive from 1979 to 1983 and its Chairman from 1983 to 1995. From 1989 to 2002 Phipps was Chairman of Greenwich Resources, a gold mining company. He was Chairman of the English String Orchestra (and was also involved with the English Symphony Orchestra) and Falklands Conservation from 1990 to 1992. In 1996 he founded Desire Petroleum, remaining Chairman until his death in 2009. Although Phipps had visited the Falkland Islands in 1975, he did not become hopeful about oil prospects in the area until 2004, when a seismic survey of the geology showed considerable quantities of oil. Personal life In 1965 he married Marion Lawrey, and they had two sons and two daughters. Phipps died on 10 January 2009, in a Birmingham hospital.Oil exploration pioneer passes away He owned a farm in Worcestershire.

Content The work is an examination of naturalist Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution he proposed and marshaled evidence for in The Origin of Species. A brief account of his visit to the Gal√°pagos Islands brings up the issue of human origins, leading into a discussion of early theories on the formation and age of the earth and evolution. A biographical sketch of Darwin follows, covering his youth, his naturalistic studies on the voyage of the Beagle and subsequent life, focusing on his scientific researches and writings. The history of the theory of human evolution as currently understood is then presented, with sections on the work of Mendel, the development of the science of genetics, and the Scopes Trial. It includes a selected bibliography and index. Reception Isadora Kunitz, writing in the Library Journal, found the work a \\"well-written account of Charles Darwin's life and work,\\" with \\"[d]etails about his personal life add[ing] to the interest of the book.\\" She judged it \\"an excellent supplementary title for collections.\\"Kunitz, Isadora. \\"The Book Review: Junior High Up\\" in Library Journal, v. 97, no. 20, November 15, 1972, page 3812.

The street is notable for its Georgian architecture as well as the location of historic London clubs and hotels, which have been frequented by world leaders and historic figures in the arts. It also hosts a number of contemporary art galleries. An equestrian sculpture by Elisabeth Frink stands on the junction of Dover Street and Piccadilly, opposite the Ritz Hotel.  Location  The street lies in the south of Mayfair in the West End. To the south-east, the street adjoins the major thoroughfare of Piccadilly. To the north-west, it runs up past Stafford Street to the junction with Hay Hill, then continues as Grafton Street. To the north-east is Albemarle Street, running parallel with Dover Street and the location of the Royal Institution. South-west is Berkeley Street (adjoining Berkeley Square to the north), also running in parallel. The nearest tube station is Green Park.  History  Dover Street was built by a syndicate of developers headed by Sir Thomas Bond. The syndicate purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1683 and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time the house backed onto open fields and the development of the various estates in Mayfair was just getting underway. The syndicate also built Bond Street and Albemarle Street. The street is named after Henry Jermyn, 1st Baron Dover, one of the partners in the syndicate. In June 1797 John Nash moved into 28 Dover Street a building of his own design, he built an even bigger house next door at 29 into which he moved the following year.John Summerson, The Life and Work of John Nash Architect, 1980, George Allen & Unwin, p.30 Edward Moxon moved from premises he had established in 1830 in New Bond Street to 44 Dover Street. He published Wordsworth from 1835 onwards and in 1839 issued the first complete edition of Shelley's poems. In 1841, he was found guilty of blasphemy for passages in Shelley's Queen Mab. Anne Lister (1791‚Äì1840), a notable Victorian landowner and diarist, liked to stay at Hawkins, located at 26 Dover Street. Brown's Hotel (then termed a \\"genteel inn\\") was established in 1837 by James Brown, Lord Byron's valet, who took a lease on 23 Dover Street to cater for those who were in town \\"for the Season\\". He ran it with his wife, Sarah Willis, the personal maid of Lady Byron, who gave financial support. The hotel was later enlarged and joined with backing premises on Albemarle Street. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell made the first successful telephone call in Britain from the hotel. In 1890, The International Niagara Commission met in the hotel and their decision on distributing \\"Niagara power\\" subsequently led to the adoption of the alternating current worldwide. Other guests have included Napoleon III, Theodore Roosevelt (at the time of his marriage), Rudyard Kipling and Agatha Christie (her book At Bertram's Hotel is based on Brown's). Oliver Wendell Holmes in Our Hundred Days in Europe records staying at Mackellar's Hotel, 17 Dover Street, where \\"we found ourselves comfortably lodged and well cared for during the whole time we were in London\\". Fr√©d√©ric Chopin took lodgings in Dover Street in 1848 and performed a number of piano recitals in London and undertook piano lessons. In the 1920s many notable photographers were based in Dover Street including Paul Tanqueray, Hugh Cecil and Alexander Bassano. Marcus Adams, Yvonne Gregory and Bertram Park, the \\"Three Photographers\\", were based at 43 Dover Street. Green Park Underground station was originally known as Dover Street station. The original Leslie Green-designed building was located in Dover Street, but, following refurbishment in the 1930s to install escalators, the entrance was moved to Piccadilly and the station was renamed. Clubs The street is historically and currently the location of a number of well-known London clubs, although the oldest and most fashionable London clubs are located in St James's and Pall Mall: * The Albemarle Club, originally in Albemarle Street nearby, was relocated to 37 Dover Street before its closure. * The Arts Club, founded by Charles Dickens and others in 1863, originally in Hanover Square, has been located at 40 Dover Street since 1893. Whistler's decision to sue John Ruskin was made on the premises. The Arts Club premises are currently used for meetings of the Eccentric Club. * The Bath Club, where Mark Twain breakfasted. * The Capisce Club, 1 Dover Street, was formerly a nightclub and restaurant. * Mahiki, 1 Dover Street, is a nightclub and bar, with a Polynesian and tiki theme, predominantly specialising in rum. Often frequented by celebrities and royalty, including Prince William. * Empress Club, 35 Dover Street, Towards the end of the 19th century, the idea of a London club solely for women, was put forward by one of Queen Victoria's Ladies-in-Waiting, With the help of other Ladies at Court, and indeed with the blessing of the Queen herself, the idea went ahead, and on 24 May 1897 the Empress Club opened ‚Äì founded the ‚ÄúLadies of England‚Äù and in commemoration of her Majesty's Golden Jubilee. The Club's foundation marked a new era in the history of Ladies‚Äô Clubs. Unconnected with any political movement it soon became powerful Social Institution. Headed by the Duchess of Leeds, the Vice-Presidents and Committee included a Princess and several Countesses. The original clubhouse was at 32 Dover Street, such was the rush to join that within 12 months a new site had to be found on which to erect a building worthy of the large and influential membership which represented nearly every known family of distinction. The site found was at No. 35, almost next door, and by 1901 the Empress Club was installed in a most impressive and palatial building with another entrance in Berkley Street. It boasted12 Reception Rooms, handsomely decorated, and one hundred bedrooms for which the lowest charge was 4/- a night- and this included Lights, Boots, Bath and attendance. Coal fires, it is true, were 1/6 extra but Ladies‚Äô Maids could be accommodated for 7/6 per day! Members wishing to interview servants at the Club had to give two clear days‚Äô notice to the Secretary and then conduct the interview before 12 noon. Ladies could keep their cycles at the Club, but dogs were not allowed and Gentlemen guests only as far as the Dining and drawing Rooms. An orchestra played during afternoon tea (1/-) and smoking was permitted. It also played in the Grand Dining Hall during dinner, after which smoking was again allowed. Luncheon was 2/6 and dinner 3/6! During the great war over ¬£50,000 was raised by members in aid to the Forces, and again ¬£16,000 in World War II. The Club withstood many near misses from bombs and suffered considerable damage from fire in 1941 After the war the Club never quite recovered its former glory and some years later it was sold. Most of the building was turned into offices and the Grand Dining Hall became a Night Club. In 1961 this was acquired by the Caprice - A l‚ÄôEcu de France group, where it became the Empress Restaurant. The property is currently occupied by Christian Louboutin.

The village is most famous for its prehistoric Stanton Drew stone circles, the largest being the Great Circle, a henge monument consisting of the second largest stone circle in Britain (after Avebury). The stone circle is 113 m in diameter and probably consisted of 30 stones, of which 27 survive today. The village also has a range of listed buildings, dating from the 13th to 15th centuries, including the church of St Mary the Virgin, the Round House (Old Toll House) and various farmhouses. The parish of Stanton Drew, which includes the hamlet of Stanton Wick, has a population of 787. Until 1947 the parish also included Belluton and part of Pensford. It includes a primary school, pubs (the Druids Arms and the Carpenters Arms at Stanton Wick), church and village hall, which is the venue for a mother and toddler group and preschool as well as various village activities. The area around the village has several dairy and arable farms on neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. It is also a dormitory village for people working in Bath and Bristol. History Stanton Drew was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Stantone, meaning 'The stone enclosure with an oak tree' from the Old English stan and tun and from the Celtic deru. After the Norman Conquest the Lords of the Manor took their name from the village. In the reign of Henry II Robert de Stanton was succeeded by Geoffrey de Stanton. One of the family Drogo or Drew gave his name to the place to distinguish it from Stanton Prior and Stanton Wick. It subsequently came into the possession of the Choke and then the Cooper and Coates families. The parish of Stanton Drew was part of the Keynsham Hundred,. =Coal mining= There is a long history of coal mining in the parish and the locations of many small pits are still visible in newly ploughed fields. For example the philosopher John Locke who grew up in Belluton owned land in the parish which was being exploited for coal in 1680. During the 19th and 20th centuries there were three coal mines within the parish. The Rydons mine operated from 1808 until 1833, the Pensford Colliery operated from 1909 to 1955 and the Bromley Pit operated from 1860 - 1957. These mines formed part of the northern section of the Somerset coalfield. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. Along with Chelwood and Clutton, Stanton Drew is part of the Clutton Ward which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Demographics According to the 2011 Census, the parish of Stanton Drew, had 787 residents, living in 291 households. Landmarks =Rectory Farmhouse= The Rectory Farmhouse is a Grade II* listed building, dating from the 15th century. It is probably most famous for its previous owners, Dr and Mrs Jeremy Telling, one of Bristol's longest- serving GPs. A barn about 35 metres west of the farmhouse dates from the same period, as does a dovecote in the grounds. =The Round House= The Round House (Old Toll House) at Stanton Drew At the northern entrance to the village before the bridge over the River Chew is a white thatched, 18th-century house which became a toll house when turnpikes were in use. It is a Grade II listed building. =The Court= The Court in Bromley Road dates from 1753 and is a Grade II* listed building. It is now used as a nursing home. The walls and piers around this property are themselves Grade II listed. =Watermill= There is some evidence of a watermill, used as a forge in the 1660s, a copper mill from 1713‚Äì1860 and then a paper mill. =Other Grade II listed buildings= There are several other listed buildings in the village, the oldest being the 15th-century Church Farmhouse. Buildings from the 17th century include Byemills Farmhouse, Codrington Cottage, Stanton Wick Farmhouse, Parson's Farmhouse, and another cottage and attached wall near the church. Later buildings include those from the 19th century such as: Mill Place, and its accompanying wall and piers, Rosedale, and Fern Cottage. =Bridge= Bridge at Stanton Drew The narrow limestone bridge over the River Chew is possibly 13th or 14th-century in origin with more recent repairs. The bridge spans about 12 metres, about 5 metres across footway, parapet wall to each side, about one metre high. Each side has two pointed arches with chamfered mouldings and relieving arch, central cutwater with off-sets to each side and pyramidal stone top, inner ribs to vaults; on east side, oval plaque with illegible inscription and strengthening with exposed steel girder. Ancient Monument Avon no. 162. The bridge was damaged in the Great Flood of 1968. Religious sites Stone circle with St Mary's church tower in background The Church of St Mary the Virgin has been a place of Christian worship for at least eight hundred years. In the north aisle is the Norman bowl of the font and further east the small turret steps behind a glass door that in earlier times led up into a rood loft. Although parts date from the 13th and 14th centuries the interior, as it is seen today, shows the work that was carried out in the mid 19th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. The Hazle, Wight Preston and several other unidentified monuments in the churchyard are also listed, along with the piers, gates and overthrow at the north-east entrance to churchyard. Popular culture Stanton Drew was commemorated by Adge Cutler in his popular song \\"When the Common Market Comes to Stanton Drew\\". Written in response to opening up of trade with Europe, Adge suggests what might happen to Somerset culture when Europeans come over. In retrospect, it is more truthful than anyone could have imagined ‚Äì \\"when George comes home from milking, ee'll get a big surprise, when 'ee sits down expecting Irish Stew, an' his wife says George i'll get 'ee, a gert dollop of spaghetti, 'cos the Common Market's come to Stanton Drew\\". The Dancers of Stanton Drew is a song written by Jim Parker and Muriel Holland and performed by The Yetties. It tells the story of Sue and William being turned to stone after dancing on a Sunday in Stanton Drew. \\"Stanton Drew in the County of Somerset That's where the Devil played at Sue's request They paid the price for dancing on a Sunday Ever as stones they stand at rest\\" References External linksStanton Drew Primary School * Stanton Drew Church * Map of Stanton Drew circa 1884 * River Chew website Category:Somerset coalfield Category:Civil parishes in Somerset Category:Villages in Bath and North East Somerset ","title":"Stanton Drew"},{"id":"5976698","title":"It's Your Love"},{"id":"5976702","text":"Adam Hunter (11 November 1908 ‚Äì 9 April 1991) was a British Labour Party politician.

Today round trips in light aircraft take place from Peenem√ºnde Airfield. Bus tours are also available, on which one can visit the former shelters of the NVA and the remnants of the V-1 flying bomb facilities. Because of its long runway the airfield Peenem√ºnde is also a location for flight schools. History Peenem√ºnde Airfield April 1943 reconnaissance image of Usedom island, with airfield at upper left On April 2, 1936, the Reich Air Ministry paid 750,000 German Reichsmarks to the town of Wolgast for the whole Northern peninsula of Usedom. The airfield began service on 1 April 1938, and on the same date, the Air Ministry officially separated Peenem√ºnde- West from the joint command that included the adjacent Army Research Center Peenem√ºnde. As Werk West, the Luftwaffe Test Site () and under control from the central Erprobungsstelle Rechlin facility inland, the Peenem√ºnde-West coastal facility was used for testing experimental aircraft (Erprobungsflugzeug) such as the Heinkel He 176 (flown at Peenem√ºnde on June 20, 1939) and the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered fighter (code named 'Peenem√ºnde 30' by British intelligence ‚Äì the '30' referring to the object's measured wingspan in feet). At the northeast edge of the concrete airfield was a launch ramp for testing the V-1 flying bomb and on which, in 1943, RAF officer Constance Babington Smith, working at RAF Medmenham, detected a small winged aircraft ('Peenem√ºnde 20') while viewing an Allied reconnaissance photograph.By late 1941, the Army Research Center at Peenem√ºnde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the V2. The airfield was also used for take-off of Heinkel He 111 for initial air-launch testing of V-1s. V-1 launch crew training was at the nearby resort of Zempin, and after the August 1943 Operation Hydra bombing of the area, V-1 flight testing was moved to Br√ºsterort. Peenem√ºnde West also developed World War II night-navigation and radar systems (Dr. Johannes Plendl). After the 2nd Belorussian Front under General Konstantin Rokossovsky captured the Swinem√ºnde port and Usedom island on May 5, 1945, the airfield became part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. =Post-war= In 1956, the airfield received a new 2,465 metre-long concrete runway, which is oriented in a northwesterly direction and allows the operation of modern military jet planes. A further landmark is the collection of radio beacons at the northwest end, which were built on artificial islands in the sea. In 1961, the airfield was transferred to the National People's Army (NVA), which used it until 1990. Main unit was the Jagdfliegergeschwader 9 (JG-9) (english: Fighter Wing 9) with MiG-21 and later MiG-23 in different versions. From 1972 the Zieldarstellungskette 33 (ZDK-33) (roughly: Target Towing Flight 33) was also stationed at Peenem√ºnde airfield. It was subordinated to the JG-9 and used Il-28 and later Aero L-39 to serve the anti- aircraft firing ranges Zingst and Ueckerm√ºnde. After 1990, the airfield was used among other things as parking area of former military vehicles of the NVA. From Summer 2010, a high-performance jet trainer aircraft Aero L-39 Albatros of the former National People's Army (NVA) is back on Peenem√ºnde Airfield.Aero L-39 Albatros on Peenem√ºnde See also Website of the Airfield (German) References External linksAirfield Category:Buildings and structures in Vorpommern-Greifswald Category:Research and development in Nazi Germany Category:V-1 flying bomb facilities Category:German V-2 rocket facilities Category:World War II sites in Germany Category:World War II sites of Nazi Germany Category:Government buildings completed in 1938 Category:Military airbases established in 1938 Category:1938 establishments in Germany Category:20th century in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Category:Air Forces of the National People's Army Category:Airports in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ","title":"Peenem√ºnde Airfield"},{"id":"5976709","text":"The Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium where Gryseels is Director-General Dr Guido Gryseels is a Belgian academic and agricultural economist who has been Director-General of the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium since 2001.

Albemarle Street is a street in Mayfair in central London, off Piccadilly. It has historic associations with Lord Byron, whose publisher John Murray was based here, and Oscar Wilde, a member of the Albemarle Club, where an insult he received led to his suing for libel and to his eventual imprisonment. It is also known for its art galleries and the Brown's Hotel is located at 33 Albemarle Street. History View of Clarendon House, now demolished. Albemarle Street runs through the centre of the site of the house. Albemarle Street was built by a syndicate of developers headed by Sir Thomas Bond. The syndicate purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1684, which had fallen into ruin due to neglect caused by the dissolute duke's spendthrift ways. It was sold for ¬£20,000, a fifth less than the duke had paid for it only nine years previously despite the land values in the area increasing in the intervening period. The house was demolished and the syndicate proceeded to develop the area. At that time the house backed onto open fields and the development of the various estates in Mayfair was just getting underway. The syndicate also built Old Bond Street, Dover Street and Stafford Street. Albemarle Street was the first one-way street created for the purpose of better traffic flow in London. The decision was taken after a series of lectures by Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution caused long traffic jams in the capital because of the horrendous queues formed by horsedrawn carriages bringing in the eager audience. Albemarle Street was made a one-way street to avoid further incidents of such congestion. Notable residents Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (1661‚Äì1724), a leading minister of Queen Anne, had a house in Albemarle Street where he died in 1724. Victor Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill (1864‚Äì1934), a Page of Honour to Queen Victoria and British peer, was born at 32 Albemarle Street. Anne Lister (1791-1840), a notable Victorian lesbian, stayed at 29 Albemarle Street in rooms owned by Hawkins, who also had premises in Dover Street.Anne Lister in London 1819-1839 The Albemarle Club was originally in Albemarle Street and relocated to Dover Street nearby before its closure. Oscar Wilde was a member. In 1895, the Marquess of Queensberry left his calling card for Wilde with the infamous note \\"For Oscar Wilde, posing as a somdomite\\" [sic]. This led to Wilde's failed libel action and subsequent criminal prosecution. The publisher John Murray was located at 50 Albemarle Street during the 19th and 20th centuries. Lord Byron's memoirs were destroyed in the fireplace on the first floor after his death. Sir John Betjeman, the poet and broadcaster was another Murray author. Murray also published Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859. Frenchman Alexander Grillion opened Grillion's Hotel at No. 7 in 1803. Louis XVIII stayed here in 1814, before his return to France. It was also the meeting place of Grillion's dining club. The Royal Thames Yacht Club was later based here. The Royal Institution in Albemarle Street, c. 1838 The Royal Institution is at 21 Albemarle Street and forms an imposing backdrop on the street with its row of classical columns on its frontage. The building has been greatly enlarged and redeveloped since 1799 when the Institution was founded, and is now a Grade I listed building. Because of the Institution's popularity (through its scientific lectures), Albemarle Street became London's first one-way street to avoid traffic problems. The naturalist Thomas Huxley founded the X Club as a dining club meeting for the first time on 3 November 1864 at St George's Hotel, Albemarle Street, with a select membership of nine proponents of the evolutionary \\"new reformation\\" in naturalism who supported the ideas of Charles Darwin and became increasingly influential in late 19th century science. Rev. William Webb Ellis (1806‚Äì1872) was an Anglican clergyman who is famous for allegedly being the inventor of Rugby football whilst a pupil at Rugby School. He graduated from Oxford with a BA in 1829 and received his MA in 1831. He entered the Church and became chaplain of St George's Chapel, Albemarle Street, London (c. 1800‚Äì1903). Here he published his Sermons: Preached in St. George's Chapel, Albemarle Street; to Which Is Added, an Essay On the Prophecies Relative to Christ. The Chapel was built on instructions of Lord Suffield who lived on Albemarle Street and leased land at number 27 on which at some time between 1800 and 1811 a proprietary chapel, St George's, was built (demolished in the early twentieth century). The Beaux-Arts building, the Mellier, at 26b Albemarle Street originally the home and showroom of Charles Mellier & Co. Mellier was born in France and became a successful high quality cabinet maker and decorator; one of his most famous commissions was for the liner RMS Mauretania. In 1921 Lendrum Motors moved to Mayfair, taking the recently vacated ground floor and basement premises of the Mellier building, creating a fashionable and stylish motor showroom, renamed it ‚ÄòBuick House‚Äô and from 1923 known as Lendrum & Hartman Limited. It was a major London importer, and sole UK concessionaires of Buick and Cadillac cars from North America between 1919 and 1968. It became the most prestigious car dealership in the country, having sold a Buick to the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII in 1935. Today the building is renamed the Mellier again, has been transformed by architect Eric Parry from commercial use into apartments. In the 1950s, Ern≈ë Goldfinger's design for two office buildings at 45‚Äì46 Albemarle Street was praised for its sensitivity to the surrounding Georgian architecture.Ern≈ë Goldfinger / Designing Modern Britain ‚Äî Design Museum Galleries Northward view of Albemarle Street, from the Stafford Street junction.

The town was a station stop on the Union Pacific Railroad line from Idaho Falls, Idaho to Butte, Montana. There was a post office in Armstead from 1907 to 1962. Armstead is perhaps best remembered as the eastern terminus and headquarters of the Gilmore and Pittsburgh Railroad, which operated a line from there to Salmon, Idaho between 1910 and 1939. The Lewis and Clark expedition traveled past the future location of Armstead during its westward trek in 1805. The construction of Clark Canyon Dam in 1961-1964 created a reservoir that completely inundated the former site of Armstead.

Following the Japanese surrender, she sailed under the command of Lt. Harold C. \\"Brownie\\" Brown to Newport News, Virginia, arriving 16 May 1946. Mink decommissioned on 26 June and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 27 June. On 19 July she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. Renamed Judah Touro, she was subsequently sold into merchant service, and later carried the names Seavalor, Apukia, and Eleni V. Mink received three battle stars for World War II service.

It was introduced in the 13th-century French Prose Lancelot as the home and formidable fortress of the hero Lancelot after his conquest of it from the forces of evil. Le Morte d'Arthur identified it with Bamburgh Castle. Legend As told in the Vulgate Cycle's Lancelot en prose and the works based on it, the Joyous Gard is given its name by the young Lancelot (who had just discovered his own identity) when he sets up his household at the castle. He does it after single-handedly capturing it against all odds and ending its evil enchantment during the task to prove his knighthood to King Arthur (even rescuing Arthur's illegitimate son in the process). Up until then, it had been known as Dolorous Gard (French Douloureuse Garde and other variants), belonging to the Saxon-allied king Brandin of the Isles; the various motifs and perceived symbolism of the Dolorous Gard episode were subjects of several analyses by modern scholars. In the prose stories of Tristan and Iseult, the pair later lives in the castle with Lancelot's permission as refugees from King Mark of Cornwall. Following Lancelot's adulterous and treasonous affair with Arthur's wife Queen Guinevere, Lancelot rescues Guinevere, who is under sentence of death from Arthur, and brings her to the Joyous Gard. In the Stanzaic Morte Arthur and elsewhere, Arthur and Gawain unsuccessfully besiege the castle. Eventually, Lancelot abandons his castle and goes to an exile in today's France. After his death, Lancelot's body is taken to the Joyous Gard for burial. In the French prose cycles, he is laid to rest next to the grave of his dear friend Galehaut (in the version from the Post-Vulgate Mort Artu, their remnants are later dug up and destroyed by King Mark). Suggested locations Bamburgh Castle in 2008 In his Le Morte d'Arthur, the late-medieval English writer Thomas Malory identified the Joyous Gard with Bamburgh Castle, a coastal castle in Northumberland that was built on former location of a Celtic Briton fort known as Din Guarie. Before writing his work, Malory personally participated in the Yorkist siege of the castle during the War of the Roses. He also proposed the nearby Alnwick Castle. Joyous Gard is further associated with Ch√¢teau de Joyeuse Garde, an early medieval castle site in Brittany where the continental Arthurian tradition began.

Musgrove played for his local side, Lynemouth Colliery, before being called up for national service, which he served in the Royal Air Force. He played for a Forces team and also for Scottish junior side Sunnybank while in the RAF and joined West Ham United in December 1953. At West Ham, he soon established himself as a left-winger, making his league debut in 1954 against Brentford. He went on to make 301 league and cup appearances for the Hammers before joining Leyton Orient as player-coach in December 1962. He became chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in 1962 and remained in the post until his retirement as a player in 1966. He left Orient in 1965 to coach Charlton Athletic under Bob Stokoe, from where he moved to Aston Villa in 1967. In late 1968, he joined Leicester City as assistant manager under former West Ham teammate Frank O'Farrell, taking them back to the top flight when they won the Division 2 Championship in 1970‚Äì71. When O'Farrell moved to Manchester United in June 1971, Musgrove followed, again taking an assistant manager's position. O'Farrell and Musgrove were both sacked by Manchester United in December 1972, after a disastrous 5‚Äì0 loss at Crystal Palace. In January 1973, Musgrove took the manager's job at Torquay United, a post that O'Farrell had held himself five years earlier. He had little success at Torquay, with a highest league finish of 9th place in 1975‚Äì76 in his time at Plainmoor. He left Torquay in November 1976, to be replaced by O'Farrell, and the following year coached NASL side Connecticut Bicentennials. In 1978, he coached another NASL side, Chicago Sting and on his return to England sold insurance for a while before joining Exeter City as coach/physio. He was made redundant in 1984 and then took the post of physio for the Qatar FA in the Middle East. On his return, two years later, he became coach/physio at Plymouth Argyle, where he stayed until joining former Hammer John Bond at Shrewsbury Town. There, he was part of the backroom staff when they won the Third Division title in 1993, before retiring in 1998. On retiring, he moved back to Torquay with his wife, Jean, to be nearer their children, David, Martin & Allison, and grandchildren.

It was formed on 27 November 1943 from distinguished veterans and Patrol Service personnel. This corps was formed into three Feldj√§ger Commands (I, II and III), which reported directly to Field Marshal Keitel, and was senior to all other military police organizations. This was divided into 30 (Streifen) Patrols, which were based 12 miles behind the front lines. These patrols could be rough in their justice, which included summary executions. They were supported by a Streifkorps (Patrol Corps), organized into sections of a senior non- commissioned officer and 9 enlisted personnel. History By 1943, World War II was turning against Germany and morale amongst the front line troops was dropping. Until this time, the Feldgendarmerie and Geheime Feldpolizei had been relied upon to try to curb desertion and maintain discipline; however, the recent string of German defeats and the fact that there was no single service dedicated solely to catching deserters impelled the creation of the Feldj√§gerkorps in November of that year. In order to be eligible for service, soldiers had to have a minimum three years of frontline combat experience and have earned the Iron Cross 2nd class. Organization The Feldj√§gerkorps consisted of 3 Feldj√§gerkommando: * Feldj√§gerkommando I was formed in K√∂nigsberg. It was commanded by General der Flieger Ernst M√ºller. * Feldj√§gerkommando II was formed in Breslau. Its commanders were General der Panzertruppe Werner Kempf, General der Infantrie Karl von Oven and General der Artillerie Willi Moser. * Feldj√§gerkommando III was formed in Vienna. It commanders were General der Infantrie Hans-Karl von Scheele, General der Infantrie Martin Grase and General der Flieger Wilhelm Speidel. Feldj√§gerkommando I and II saw action on the Eastern front, whilst Feldj√§gerkommando III saw action on the western front. Each Feldj√§gerkommandeur originally controlled a Feldj√§gerabteilung (battalion), and from 24 April 1944, a regiment). The Fj battalion consisted of five motorized companies, each of 30 officers and 90 non-commissioned officers. The Feldj√§gerregiment contained five Feldj√§gerabteilungen each of which contained three Kompanies, of about 50 men. The basic unit was the Streife (patrol) which was made up of anywhere between 1 Feldj√§ger and 3 Feldj√§ger and an officer. Every Abteilung had command over a \\"Fliegendes Standgericht\\" (flying drumhead trial/flying court martial), which composed of three judges. The leadership of a regiment consist of a \\"Chefrichter\\" (chief justice) next to the Kommandeur (commander).Kalmbach, Peter Lutz (2013): Polizeiliche Ermittlungsorgane der Wehrmachtjustiz.

The commanding officer of a Feldj√§gerkommando had the same level of authority as an Army commander with the authority to punish any soldier of any branch of service (the Waffen SS included). The Feldj√§gerkorps operated parallel to the front line and approximately 12‚Äì15 miles behind it. Their basic duties were to: * maintain order and discipline * prevent panic retreats * gather stragglers and assemble them at collection points, where they could be assembled into ad hoc units * check soldiers travel and/or leave permits at embarkation points * round up deserters and either return to their units, hand them over to the Feldgendarmerie or Geheime Feld Polizei or issue punishment themselves. * Gather Prisoners of War (PoWs) and hand them over to the appropriate authorities. They could also be employed in the same capacity as the Feldgendarmerie. After the surrender of Germany, Feldj√§gerkommando remained armed and at the disposal of the US Army in order to maintain discipline amongst the German PoWs. Feldj√§gerkommando finally and formally surrendered its arms to the Allies on 23 June 1946. Uniform The Feldj√§ger wore a regular German Army infantryman's uniform with white Waffenfarbe. The only items identifying him were the gorget and the red armband worn on the lower left cuff, bearing the bold black lettering: Oberkommando der Wehrmacht -Feldj√§ger-. Other Feldj√§ger units The SA-Feldj√§gerkorps - In October 1933 Hermann G√∂ring established a supplementary police group for use within the State of Prussia. This group was also intended to have responsibilities in selected cities within Greater Germany. The unit consisted of former polizei members and volunteers recruited from existing Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) units. At this point in their history, leaders of the Nazi Party intended to use police brigades for protection as well as for gaining power over other political groups. Much of the intent of organizing these police units was to band together groups of men who had military training and knowledge stemming from their First World War experience. Designated the SA Field Police (SA-Feldj√§gerkorps), this formation was organized into eight battalions of approximately 195 men each with each battalion being assigned to a specific city or district with its headquarters in Berlin. Members of the SA-Feldj√§gerkorps were allowed to rejoin or transfer into the SS following completion of their service with the unit. On 1 April 1935 the SA-Feldj√§gerkorps was incorporated into the larger Prussian ‚ÄúSchutzpolizei‚Äù and was no longer under the control of the SA or related authorities. Over time, many smaller police units were organized or cluster together for the purpose of expanding control.

As the first private railway in Norway, it opened 1 June 1894, designed to connect Os to the Voss Line, allowing for passenger and freight transport to Bergen and Voss. Despite a boom caused by World War I, the railway was eventually driven out of business by competition from road transport, which provided faster service. On 2 September 1935, it became the first Norwegian railway to close, and most of the railway was dismantled the following year. Today, only short stretches of the railway and a few stations survive. Much of the former railway line is used as a bicycle path (rail trail), which makes revival of the Nesttun‚ÄìOs Railway as a heritage railway very difficult. However, a 40 metre long railway stretch remains at Stend Station, the only unaltered remaining station, upon which a diesel locomotive and a passenger car are placed. The station building itself has been restored and is used as a museum. History Proposals to build a railway from Nesttun to Os were first made during the planning of the Voss Line from Bergen to Voss. Initial plans called for slightly longer route via Os, Samnanger, Norheimsund and Granvin. At the time it was required that local municipalities finance 20% of railways, and in 1874, Os Municipality was encouraged to purchase shares for NOK 8,000. This was rejected by the municipal council, and eventually the Voss Line was instead built via Dale.Tautra (1996): 10 In 1884, a committee was established in Fana to consider the possibility of building a branch line from Nesttun to Fana. But neither the municipality nor the county were willing to give grants to the line, and, the plans were shelved in 1885.Tautra (1996): 10‚Äì11 At the same time, the physician Daniel Schumann Kr√ºger started to popularize the possibility of building a connection from Nesttun to Os√∏ren (now Os√∏yro). At the time it was popular to build tracks along existing roads and use slow locomotives, and Kr√ºger at first proposed such a solution, but later determined to support a conventional railway.Tautra (1996): 11 In 1884, a line from Os to Nesttun was estimated to cost NOK 885,000 plus land acquisition costs. Public meetings were held and in 1885 a committee was established. The following year, an application was sent to the state for NOK 3,000 in grants for preliminary work. It was presumed that the railway would be private, but the committee wanted to receive partial state funding. While the government favored the railway, the grant was a lower priority among the many proposed railway lines at the time. In 1888, an engineer from the state investigated the route, and recommended that the line be built via R√•dal to increase the population which it would serve. In addition, Fanahammeren and Stend were regarded as transport hubs at the time. Following this, shares were issued for NOK 50,000 in the company, but this was not sufficient to finance the railway.Tautra (1996): 13 Instead of raising more capital, Kr√ºger tried to reduce the cost. He proposed reducing the minimum curve radius from and reduce the gauge from the gauge used on the Voss Line to . This would allow the railway to have sharper curves and allow it to pass around any obstacles and hills, removing the need for cuttings and tunnels. Engineer Nicolay Nicolaysen Sontum started planning the cheaper railway in 1889, and he estimated the cost to NOK 500,000. After the project was marketed in the Bergen press, shipowners Fredrik Georg Gade and Johan A. Mowinckel supported it, as did major Wollert Konow (SB). An application for a concession was sent on 15 March 1890, in which Gade and Mowinckel guaranteed the necessary capital. This made Nesttun- Os the first railway in Norway to be built without state grants. The construction contract was signed with Sontum on 29 March.Tautra (1996): 14 The concession was granted on 2 February 1891 and had a duration of 40 years from the date the line started operation. The delay was in part because there was a debate about the gauge in the Parliament of Norway. The company opened for sales of shares on 3 March 1891. The largest owners were Gade (20%), Mowinckel (10%), Os Municipality (5%) and Kr√ºger (2%).Tautra (1996): 15 The municipality used a whole year's budget on the share purchases, and borrowed money to be repaid in 40 years. In addition to the share sales, the railway received free real estate from many farmers.Tautra (1996): 16 The railway was constructed in narrow gauge, the smallest gauge ever built in Norway. The smallest curve radius was 50 metres. This combination made it possible to avoid any tunnels whatsoever and the longest bridge was 8 metres. But it also meant that all goods had to be off-loaded at Nesttun and that the railway had a maximum speed of 25 km/h. The railway was of vast importance for the Os community, as it allowed for day trips to Bergen. The rail trip took only two hours, and was considerably faster and cheaper than travel by steam ship. Despite a boom caused by World War I, the railway lost business to road transport, which provided faster service. On 2 September 1935, it became the first Norwegian railway to close, and most of the track was demolished the following year. Heritage Most of the right-of-way still exists, although all the tracks were removed in 1936. In 1980, most of the right-of-way within Bergen was converted to a hiking and bicycle trail, and later asphalted. The right-of-way can therefore be walked from Nesttun to Kismul. Along there is a combined path and road, although the latter has little traffic. The section from Selsvik to Ytre Sandvika was converted to a bicycle path in 2002, and in 2008, the path was extended another kilometer (half a mile) past Kismul. The remaining section past Kalandseid has been regulated, but lack of funding has delayed the process. While hiking is possible, the path is overgrown and some places become a swamp. From Kalandseid to S√∏fteland, the route runs next to European Route E39. South from Kalandseid, the route goes through private agricultural land towards R√∏ykenes. In Os there is a section from T√∏mmernes to S√∏fteland that has been asphalted as a path. From Storestraumen south of S√∏fteland, about one kilometer (half a mile) has been converted to a gravel path. On this section is Bergst√∏ Bridge, where of track has been laid. Stend Station has been converted to a railway museum and is the only station building to remain in its original design. In the 1980s, the building had fallen into disrepair, but from 1987, Friends of the Os Line started renovating it. It has a small display of artifacts from the railway, including old pictures, a film and items, including tools from the workshop. Outside there is a long railway line. On it is a draisine from 1925, a combined third-class and post wagon from 1894. It consists of two half frames that were welded together, with bogies bought from Poland. It is the smallest bogies wagon in Norway. The station also features a water station. The museum also has a diesel locomotive which dates from 1967. It was used by Fana and later Bergen Municipality in the sewer tunnels, and was given to the museum in 1995. It features gauge, but otherwise has no resemblance with the material used on the Nesttun‚ÄìOs Line. Os Station has been preserved and is owned by Os Municipality. Plans exist to renovate and revert it to its look from 1894, but lack of money has only resulted in the station being painted in the original colors. Plans call for a short section of track to be laid on the station area. The workshop has become the location of a sewer pumping station, although the exterior has been renovated to the original. The depot was built with decorative pillars, but there were built over in the 1930s. In the 1990s, these were removed again. Os Cultural Development has the rights to use the municipally owned building, and they have stated that they plan to convert it to a center for art. The building is planned expanded with a glass facade towards the fjord is planned, which would feature art workshops and ateliers. Ulven Station also remains, has been modernized and serves as a private residence. All the buildings at Kalandseid Station have been demolished, except a private residence. The station area of Hamre Station has been converted to a turning spot for buses. Fana Station still stands, but has been renovated and modernized to the unrecognizable, and serves as a private residence. R√•dal Station is in use as a private residence. Two passenger cars are displayed at the Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar, after they had served on the Urskog‚ÄìH√∏land Line from 1935 to 1960. They are used on the museums Tertitt train that runs on the museum area. They were renovated in 1994‚Äì95. Os Municipality has a dismounted half wagon frame from an Oldbury wagon dating from 1894. A wagon frame built by Skabo in 1907 is in use in a garden at Kismul. It includes some original benches.

Many Linux distributions require for inclusion that the game content is freely redistributable, freeware or commercial restriction clauses are prohibited.Debian Package Games Background In general, open-source games are developed by relatively small groups of people in their free time, with profit not being the main focus. Many open-source games are volunteer-run projects, and as such, developers of free games are often hobbyists and enthusiasts. The consequence of this is that open-source games often take longer to mature, are less common and often lack the production value of commercial titles. In the past (before the 2000s) a challenge to build high-quality content for games was the missing availability or the excessive price for tools like 3D modeller or toolsets for level design. In recent years, this changed and availability of open source tools like Blender, game engines and libraries drove open source and independent video gaming.PC Gaming: Doomed? or zDoomed? - Some of the most rewarding PC games out there were built by indie developers using open source code. by Michael Blake on IGN.com (22 Jun 2011) FLOSS game engines, like the Godot game engine, as well as libraries, like SDL, are increasingly common in game development, even proprietary ones.

Some of the open- source game projects are based on formerly proprietary games, whose source code was released as open-source software, while the game content (such as graphics, audio and levels) may or may not be under a free license.Linux games from Freshmeat Examples include Warzone 2100 (a real-time strategy game)Warzone 2100 Resurrection project about page and Micropolis (a city- building simulator based on the SimCity source code). Advantage of such continuation projects is that these games are already \\"complete\\" as graphic and audio content is available, and therefore the open-source authors can focus on porting, fixing bugs or modding the games. In a 2004 article, Adam Geitgey questioned the compatibility of the open-source culture with respect to the game development process. He suggested that perceived open-source development advantages don't work for games because users move on to new games relatively quickly and so don't give back to the project. Geitgey further noted that music and art development is not built up from the work of others in the same way that coding would be. He argued that high quality art content is required, which is typically produced commercially by paid artists. While Linux operates on the open-source philosophy, this may not benefit game development. As of September 2015, the Steam gaming service has 1,500 games available on Linux, compared to 2,323 games for Mac and 6,500 Windows games. History =Beginnings and early games= NetHack XEvil Just as in most other forms of software, free software was an unconscious occurrence during the creation of early computer games, particularly for earlier Unix games. These are mostly original or clone arcade games and text adventures. A notable example of this is BSD Games, a collection of interactive fiction and other text-mode titles.Ghost of Fun Time's Past ‚Äì Linux Journal Game fan communities such as the modding community do include some aspects of free software, such as sharing mods across community sites, sometimes with free to use media made for the modification. With the rise of proprietary software in the mid to late 1980s, games became more and more proprietary. However, this also led to the first deliberately free games such as GNU Chess of the GNU Project, part of whose goal is to create a complete free software system, games included.Linux and GNU ‚Äì GNU Project More advanced free gaming projects emerged, such as NetHack and Netrek, many still developed and played today in front-ends such as Vulture's Eye. As PC gaming began to rise in the late 1980s and early 1990s, free gaming also advanced. More complicated games utilizing the X Window System for graphics started to emerge, most beginning with the signature letter X. These included XBill, XEvil, xbattle, Xconq and XPilot. XBill is notable as one of the earliest free gaming titles to feature an activist theme of halting proprietary software adoption. This theme was echoed in later titles such as FreeDroidRPG. XEvil followed the development cycle of many early pieces of free software, having originally been developed as a university project, although it was freeware for a while. The game was also one of the first free titles to feature controversial subject matter such as graphic violence and drug use.XEvil at Home of the Underdogs Rocks'n'Diamonds is another earlier free software game, and one of the first for Linux. The FreeCiv project was started in 1995 and gave rise to another new style of free game development. Similar to the cooperative nature of the Linux kernel development, FreeCiv was extended by many volunteers, rather than only one or two authors. It had started out as a small university student project but then branched out into its current form and is still being developed today. FreeCiv also proved to be one of the earliest very popular free software games, and was among the first to be included with Linux distributions, a system commonly known now as a source of peer review or selection of quality for free gaming projects. Magazines, news sources and websites have also started noting free games, often in listings.Top 100 Free Games for Linux ‚Äì Linux Links Sixteen Free Games ‚Äì PC Mech Top 5 Best Free Open Source Games ‚Äì APC Mag Six Free Must Have Games for Your Mac ‚Äì Softpedia FreeCiv and other archetypes have led to the development of many other clones of popular proprietary games.Open Source Mac Gaming: 10 Free Games Reviewed ‚Äì TidBITS BZFlag, first worked on a few years earlier, is another project that had humble beginnings but grew into a popular and heavily developed project. =3D games and source releases = Tux Racer Tremulous Proprietary games such as Doom and Descent brought in the age of three-dimensional games in the early to mid 1990s, and free games started to make the switch themselves. Tuxedo T. Penguin: A Quest for Herring by Steve Baker, a game featuring the Linux mascot Tux, was an early example of a three- dimensional free software game. He and his son Oliver would later create other popular 3D free games and clones such as TuxKart and contribute to those by other developers such as Tux Racer. The Genesis3D engine project, Crystal Space and Cube also spawned other 3D free software engines and games. FlightGear is another good example, especially noting that it is not a shooter engine but a flight simulator.Top 5 Free Linux Games, Download Now ‚Äì Ixibo.com id Software, an early entrant into commercial Linux gaming, would also prove to be an early supporter of free gaming when John D.

Some games are mostly free software but contain some proprietary content such as the Cube sequel, Sauerbraten or the former Quake III Arena mod Smokin' Guns, but some developers desire and/or work on replacing these with free content. Primarily proprietary developers have also helped free gaming by creating free libraries. Loki Software helped create and maintain the Simple DirectMedia Layer and OpenAL libraries and Linux Game Publishing created and maintain the free network layer Grapple. LGP also avoids publishing games similar to popular free titles.Linux Game Publishing: Interview with Michael Simms ‚Äì Linux Gazette Many libraries/infrastructures have been created without corporate assistance however, such as the online gaming system GGZ Gaming Zone. In addition, various game creators are free software such as the ZZT remake MegaZeux, versions of Game Editor, the Game Maker inspired G-Creator, Godot, Construct, and ZGameEditor. =Rise in popularity and diversity= SuperTux Bos Wars Individuals and teams have continued creating many popular free software games, starting really in the late 1990s to the present day.

Development on this game still continues, as well as the modern Warcraft II port Wargus. Other games branched out of the engine project as well such as the Battle for Mandicor and Astroseries projects and the StarCraft port attempt Stargus. After the Stratagus example, other real time strategy games were developed, such as Globulation 2, which experiments with game management mechanics, 0 A.D., a former freeware project, and the 3D projects Spring and Glest.Top 10 Free Linux Games in 2009 ‚Äì Simple Thoughts In addition, the more economically driven strategy game Widelands bases itself upon the proprietary Settlers franchise. Racing games, another uncommon Linux commercial genre, has also seen development with TORCS and VDrift, as well as the Mario Kart-inspired SuperTuxKart. WorldForge is another example of increasing diversification, in its attempt to create a free massively multiplayer online role playing game. Free software is also the main source for educational and children's software specifically for Linux, usually utilizing the child appeal of the Tux mascot, such as Tux Paint, Tux, of Math Command, Tux Typing and related efforts.Teaching with Tux , Linux Journal, October 21st, 2009 The rise of the independent game development in the 2000s was partly driven by the growing ecosystem of open source libraries and engines; indie developers utilized the open source ecosystem due to good cross-platform capabilities and availability for limited financial burden.PC Gaming: Doomed? or zDoomed? - Some of the most rewarding PC games out there were built by indie developers using open source code. by Michael Blake on IGN.com (22 Jun 2011) =Greater organization= GNOME Mines Battle for Wesnoth Despite its initial roots as small private projects, the free software gaming scene has been becoming progressively more organized. The roots of this even go back as far as the games created for the GNU Project and to the original larger-scale free software projects like FreeCiv. Still, for the most part free game development had very little organization throughout its history. Popular games were generally separate efforts, except for instances of people working on them known for other projects such as Ingo Ruhnke, Bill Kendrick and Steve Baker. Games were commonly found in directories such as The Linux Game Tome and Freshmeat and hosted on sites like SourceForge, but they were largely only ever brought together in the form of disorganized lists. Other projects and games existed purely on small isolated personal or project websites, often unknown and ignored. The launch of the GNOME and KDE desktop projects in the late 1990s organized application and, to a certain extent, game development. Both attempts to create a more usable Linux desktop attracted volunteers to make utilities to that end. These programs included games, mostly recreations of small games like Minesweeper or Solitaire that come with Microsoft Windows, arcade classics and the like, games from combined packs such as the Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack, and occasionally original ideas. The variety and amount of these games, and other free games easily found in software repositories, have even led some to call GNOME or KDE-enabled Linux a better option for out of the box casual gaming than Microsoft Windows.Open Source Challenge, Part Nine: Games ‚Äì APC Mag Examples include gbrainy, GNOME Mines and KAtomic. Many such games are packaged into GNOME Games and kdegames. The availability of free game engines, such as Stratagus, Pygame, Sauerbraten and ioquake3 have also helped unify free software development by making the engine projects themselves hubs of activity for games that make use of them. The Battle for Wesnoth project was started in 2003 and quickly became popular to both players and editors. It also showcased some new ideas when it came to free game development. Like FreeCiv before it, it utilized the efforts of the gaming and free software community and their code, levels and artwork contributions but it also accepted storyline contributions and ideas for the game's entire fictional universe. The game's canon is maintained through review and discussion over which submitted campaigns become official, thus setting up a model for community input and organized results.Battle for Wesnoth ‚Äì Free Software Magazine This helped the game grow in scale and popularity to the point of being almost saga-like in scope. In addition, the project is worked on by many well-known free programmers, artists, designers and musicians such as the co-founder of the Open Source Initiative Eric S. Raymond,Developer entry for Eric S. Raymond on gna.org and Linux kernel hacker Rusty Russell.Developer entry for Rusty Russell on gna.orgVideo of a talk by Rusty Russell at Australian Linux conference linux.conf.au 2007 about his work on Wesnoth, from here Vega Strike has similarly allowed its community to expand the game and the surrounding lore while maintaining canon consistency. = Hubs and development teams = LinCity-NG The general lack of unity and organization has created and continues to generate some controversy among the free software community, with problems of \\"reinventing the wheel\\" by making similar clones, games and multimedia resources being cited as a notable problem to free game development. This is especially taking up more notice as other problems are corrected, such as a lack of tools, libraries, artists and coders. A more central knowledge bank, texture library, and discussion area have been called for several times. Traditionally free software video games were developed as individual projects, some small scale and others larger scale. Programmers and other developers did often work on other projects, but the whole system was very unlinked. More recently free software development teams have started appearing, groups that function like software companies and create multiple pieces of work. Examples include the developer Parallel Realities, which have released the games Project: Starfighter, The Legend of Edgar, Blob Wars: Metal Blob Solid, as well as its sequel, Blob Wars: Blob and Conquer.Parallel Realities: Retro-themed Linux games Linux Journal, June 10, 2010 (Article by Michael Reed) In recent years, content repositories such as OpenGameArt.org and The Freesound Project have enabled developers to easily find appropriately-licensed content rather than relying on programmer art. Such content is often under Creative Commons licenses or those in the GNU General Public License family, easily facilitating use by most free software projects. The Linux Game Tome \\"Game of the Month\\" team was an open group of game developers that revamp old free software games. Some examples include the transformation of TuxKart into the more modern SuperTuxKart, work on Pingus and SuperTux, and LinCity-NG, an updated version of LinCity with superior graphics.About LinCity-NG Wiki See also Independent video game development * List of open-source video games References  External links  * SourceForge Games List of games hosted by SourceForge (archived; from 2015-05-27) * Playing the Open Source Game, a 1999 article by (archived; from 2011-10-10) * LibreGameWiki * Open source games list on Github * Open source game clones list * Game category of the Free software directory * Category:Video game development ","title":"Open-source video game"},{"id":"5976869","title":"Elif Shafak"},{"id":"5976872","text":"Karen Kraft Sloan (born 3 April 1952) is a former Canadian politician who served as a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2004.

It is has been described as one of the most haunted houses in England and is thought to be the oldest house in the United Kingdom which is still occupied. Saxon and Celtic remains have been uncovered in the cellars. Part of the house is designated an SSSI as it is a proven breeding roost for the Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum).Natural England information on citation Architecture and History Originally a Saxon hall, then a church, it was then converted to a Norman hall, complete with a crypt and undercroft. Testing has shown that these remains date back to the 5th century. However, when records began of the house in 1080, it had evolved into a substantial medieval manor house which was eventually replaced with a Jacobean house in 1612. The hall has seven bedrooms, a coach house, a dining room, sitting and drawing rooms, a stable, living room and cellar. The sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa) which line the driveway are at least 500 years old and the remains of a Roman road have been found underneath the drive itself. In 2007 the building suffered damage after lightning struck nearby and in 2008 the owners of the hall were ordered to rebuild a section of wall they had knocked down. The wall was deemed to be a Grade II listed building alongside the main hall. Reports of hauntings There are at least three distinct tales which have been said to have led to hauntings at Littledean Hall. The first being the deaths of Colonel Congreve and Colonel Wigmore, who both died when the Kings garrison met with roundheads in the dining room. It is reported that visitors can still see the bloodstains where they fell. In 1741 Charles Pyrke, former occupant of the house, was accused of raping the sister of his servant. The servant promptly murdered Pyrke before being put to death himself. The servant's ghost is thought by some to haunt the hall to this day and it has been reported to be carrying a candle. Two other Pyrke brothers are said to wander the halls, having killed each other in a duel in 1740.

History An Obergefreiter of a Luftwaffe Field Division in Russia The divisions were originally authorized in October 1942, following suggestions that the German Army could be bolstered by transferring personnel from other services. The head of the Luftwaffe, Hermann G√∂ring, formulated an alternative plan to raise his own infantry formations under the command of Luftwaffe officers; this was at least partly due to political differences with the Heer. G√∂ring took great pride in the degree of political commitment and indoctrination of the air force men (he went as far as to describe the air-force paratroopers as \\"political soldiers\\") while the Army was considered (by Nazi standards) too \\"conservative\\" (linked to traditions and ideals harking back to the Imperial days of the Kaiser). General der Fallschirmj√§ger Alfred Schlemm, the commander of II. Luftwaffe Field Corps The plan was approved, and the divisions were raised from 200,000‚Äì250,000 Luftwaffe ground, support and other excess personnel. They were initially organized with two J√§ger regiments of three battalions each, along with an artillery battalion and other support units, but were substantially smaller than equivalent Heer divisions, and by G√∂ring's personal order were intended to be restricted to defensive duties in quieter sectors. Most of the units spent much of their existence on the Eastern Front: Luftwaffe Field Divisions were present at actions such as the \\"Little Stalingrad of the North\\", the attempt to relieve Velikiye Luki; the attempted defence of Vitebsk during Operation Bagration, and the fighting in the Courland Pocket, though they also fought in other theatres. The Luftwaffe Field Divisions initially remained under Luftwaffe command, but late in 1943 those that had not already been disbanded were handed over to the Heer and were reorganized as standard infantry divisions with three two-battalion rifle regiments (retaining their numbering, but with Luftwaffe attached to distinguish them from similarly numbered divisions already existing in the Heer) and Army officers. Until taken over by the Heer (and in many cases for some time afterwards) these units were issued with standard Luftwaffe feldblau uniforms, and being so easily identifiable were said to often be singled out by opposite forces. Their reputation as combat troops was poor, despite the high standard of Luftwaffe recruits, at least in part from being required to perform roles (ground warfare) for which they as airmen had little training. They were frequently used for rear echelon duties to free up front line troops.

Biography Born in New York City to actress Shirley Knight and actor producer Gene Persson. But after her parents' divorce, Hopkins was raised in London by her mother and stepfather John Hopkins, returning to New York in 1976, at the age of 12. The following year she began her career in a summer stock production of The Children's Hour starring her mother and Joanne Woodward. In 1982, at the age of 18, Hopkins graduated from the Williston Northampton School, where she was a member of the Williston Widigers. Hopkins attended the musical theater program at Carnegie Mellon University and studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Hopkins' first television credit was an appearance on the soap opera One Life to Live, followed by a regular role on Another World. In 1993, she moved to Los Angeles, where she joined The Matrix Theatre Company. She spent weekends singing at The Pink in Santa Monica, and later performed at The Cinegrill, The Gardina, and At My Place. During this period, her television credits included Beverly Hills, 90210, Murder, She Wrote, The Practice, Diagnosis: Murder, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager in the episode Live Fast and Prosper, Spin City, and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

As player, he made more than 400 appearances in the Football League as a centre half for Carlisle United, Gillingham, Bristol Rovers, Plymouth Argyle and Torquay United. As manager, he took charge of Torquay United. Green was born in Carlisle, Cumberland, and began his career as an apprentice with Carlisle United, turning professional in September 1964. He played only two league games for Carlisle, both the following season, before moving to Gillingham in July 1968. He soon found a regular place at the Priestfield Stadium, playing 132 league games, scoring 24 goals. He moved to Bristol Rovers in July 1971 and was appointed captain of the Eastville side. In July 1974, after 2 goals in 77 games, he moved to Plymouth Argyle for a fee of ¬£19,000. He captained Argyle to promotion from Division Three at the end of his first season at Home Park, going onto play 108 league games, scoring 8 goals, before leaving for local rivals Torquay United in March 1977 as player- manager for a fee of ¬£5,000. Working with the experienced Frank O'Farrell as the general manager, he put together an attacking side at Plainmoor, but could never get them challenging for promotion, not helped by the lack of funds at his disposal. He retired from playing, after 88 league games and 7 goals, to concentrate on his managerial duties. During the 1979-80 season he surprisingly turned down an offer to manage Second Division Bristol Rovers to remain at Plainmoor, but was sacked in May 1981 after a disappointing season, with O'Farrell taking over as team manager for a third time. He subsequently played for local non-league side Newton Abbot and later managed a sub-post office in Torquay.

The oldest known written version was probably composed around 1140.The Tr√©sor de la langue fran√ßaise credits Voyage de Charlemagne as ca. 1140. See for example the etymology of tournoyer. Two 15th-century reworkings of the story are also known. The romance is preserved in a single manuscript, the British Library Royal, 16. E. VIII.

Summary Charlemagne asks his wife if any king wears a crown better than he does. To Charlemagne's outrage, she answers that the (fictional) Byzantine Emperor Hugo wears one better. Under the pretense of a pilgrimage, Charlemagne and his Twelve Peers set out for the east. They go to Jerusalem first, where they meet the patriarch, who gives them many important relics to take back, and also the title of Emperor. On the way home, they stop at Constantinople, a very beautiful and rich city free from theft and poverty. There they meet Hugo, indeed a very handsome and glorious king, standing on a golden plough. They are invited to the palace, an edifice which stands on a pole and revolves when the wind revolves. Charlemagne and the Peers are welcomed in courtly fashion and they are assigned a beautiful room, in which King Hugo has hidden a spy. Charlemagne and his companions drink too much and start to joke, about their extraordinary abilities. Olivier says he can sleep with Hugo's daughter a hundred times during a single night, Turpin claims he can juggle apples while standing with each leg on a different running horse, and so forth. The next day, when confronted with these jokes, Charlemagne and his Peers retreat to their quarters ashamed. There, they pray to God in front of the relics, and promptly an angel appears, saying he will help Charlemagne. Charlemagne returns to Hugo and claims that he is indeed capable of all the things he and his companions boasted about. Hugo doesn't believe it, but with the help of God, the Peers can perform their tasks. Hugo is very impressed and takes a vow to become Charlemagne's vassal. Once back home he forgives his wife.

Unquera is a village with 803 inhabitants (INE 2005) in the municipality of Val de San Vicente, in the west of the province of Cantabria, Spain. Sitting on the r√≠a de Tina Menor, at the mouth of the River Deva it borders Asturias. It is famous throughout Spain for its pies of Unquera. Unquera is also known as the entrance to the Hermida gorge, the most usual way to access the Li√©bana district, which has become the main throughway of the town. This route is also part of the Camino Lebaniego, which links the Caminos de Santiago of the North and French route. The population depends in part on Pesu√©s, the municipal capital, where the town hall, the barracks of the Guardia Civil and the primary school are located.  History  During the Old Regime, the municipality of Val de San Vicente belonged to nobles of the house of the Marquises de Aguilar de Campoo. However, Unquera as a locality has a very short life historically by European calculations. It did not appear on the map of Coello until(1861), although the Unquera Cove is mentioned in the Tina Mayor estuary. Unquera may have developed at the end of the XIX century thanks to the improvement of communications, especially by the railroad, and for the commercial boom of the region, possible after the opening of the gorge road (later N-621) in 1863. This road was used as a way to export, through the Unquera inlet, raw materials from Li√©bana and the La Hermida gorge to England, Belgium and (Germany). In 1881 Unquera is already cited as a village at the bottom of Tina Mayor. Since then Unquera has grown linearly around the road, and also parallel to the estuary, where it has a river walk.  Economy  The food industry stands out for the main industry, represented mainly by the brand Pindal (others being others such as Canal and Sanbar ). Canneries in this industry has existed since the XIX century in Unquera and are still maintaining active manufacturing of preserves and pickling.  Transportation  Unquera has the following ground transportation: * Line of FEVE, which links the population with Santander and with Asturias. * Autov√≠a del Cant√°brico, one of whose accesses is located next to the town. * Bus lines, among which stands out the line of ALSA Ir√∫n ‚Äì Santiago de Compostela, which takes Unquera as one of its stops * Road N-621, which links Le√≥n and Unquera, the most usual route to access Potes and the only one from the coast Cantabrian.

The Radika proper is long, but measured from the most distant source in its watershed, that of the Crni Kamen river, it is long.  Origin  The Crni Kamen (Cyrillic: –¶—Ä–Ω–∏ –ö–∞–º–µ–Ω; Albanian: Guri i zi, meaning \\"black stone\\") springs out from the northern slopes of the Vraca mountain, the southern extension of the ≈†ar Mountains, under the Golema Vraca peak (). The 'Guri i Zi' 'Crni Kamen' originally flows westward, through the Gora region, bends around the Vraca and sharply turns to the south and empties into the Kosovo- Macedonian border river Kafa Kadis (Albanian: Qafa e Kadis√´; Macedonian: –å–∞—Ñ–∞ –ö–∞–¥–∏—Å/·∏∞afa Kadis; Serbian: –ã–∞—Ñ–∞ –ö–∞–¥–∏—Å/ƒÜafa Kadis). The Kafa Kadis originates from the southern slopes of the Vraca mountain and northern slopes of the Mangulova Kula mountain, another extension of the ≈†ar Mountains. It flows westwards, on the northern section of the mountain of Niƒçipurska planina (Brodec peak, still part of the ≈†ar massif) and for several kilometers forms the Kosovo-Macedonian border. After it receives the Crni Kamen from the right and another stream coming from Kosovo, the Kafa Kadis turns south into the Macedonian proper again and from this point it is known as the Radika.  Upper Radika  Upper Radika is just long and due to the human managing of its course, it belongs to the Aegean Sea drainage basin, unlike the latter course of the Lower Radika which belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin. It flows to the south between the mountains of Korab to the west and Niƒçipurska planina to the east. At the village of Volkovija, an artificial bifurcation is created, as the waters of the Upper Radika are conducted into the artificial Mavrovo Lake at the village of Mavrovi Anovi and from there, via the Mavrovo system of the hydroelectric power plants, into the Vardar river (in this bifurcational flow, it even receives a tributary, small stream of Beliƒçica from the right).  Lower Radika  In the lower, -long section of the course, the Radika continues its general direction to the south. It carved a long and deep gorge between the mountains of Korab and De≈°at on the west and Bistra (on the east). There are many interesting places along the Radika valley; including the villages of Velebrdo, Rostu≈°a, Janƒçe, Prisojnica, Skudrinje, the Saint Jovan Bigorski Monastery, the spa of Kosovratska banja (with sulphuric water, hot up to ) and the unique Alƒçija cave, formed in alabaster. Alabaster is abundant in the surrounding terrain and it has been extracted and treated for industrial and commercial use in the town of Debar. After the gorge, the Radika receives its major tributary, the Valovica river from the right and flows on the northern slopes of the Stogovo mountain. After the villages of Dolno Kosovrasti, Dolno Melniƒçani, Gorenci and Rajƒçica, the Radika empties into the Black Drin, just south of Debar. The river Black Drin is one of tributaries of River Drin, while the next is White Drin that originate from Kosova. Actually, the lowest section of the river is floodbed by the artificial lake Debar on the Black Drin, becoming one of lake's bays. Overall, the Radika belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin, drains an area of itself and it is not navigable. The Radika has huge possibilities for the hydroelectric power production, which is partially used in its upper course. Also, the river valley is the natural route for the major road in Western North Macedonia which connects the regions of Polog and Ohrid.

While alternate spellings abound (e.g., fold- forming, fold forming, Foldforming, and even form-folding, the definitive book \\"Foldforming\\" by Charles Lewton-Brain consistently uses the spelling of foldforming as one lowercase word. Origins The original technique of foldforming was originated and developed in the late 1980s by Charles Lewton- Brain, an English-born goldsmith who lived and studied in Tanzania, the United States, and Germany before moving to Canada. Outside of the Industrial Revolution, the method represents the first major innovation in metalworking in thousands of years.Revere, Alan. \\"THE INNOVATORS, PART IV: Charles Lewton- Brain: Goldsmith, Inventor, Teacher, Author, Publisher, Web Master\\" Professional Jeweller Magazine, June 1998, accessed 16 July 2006. In the 1980s, the technique of foldforming metal was developed by Charles Lewton- Brain, who from a young age was interested in art and was inspired to pursue his interest in jewelry by his girlfriend's mother.Isherwod, B. (2013). Nature and Structure: The Balancing Act of Charles Lewton-Brain. Metalsmith, 33(1), 46-53. In 1974 he went to the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, where he studied jewelry-making and metalsmithing. After his college career, Christian Gaudernack, one of the NASCAD professors and a Norwegian goldsmith, inspired Lewton-Brain to continue his education, and he went on to attend the Fachhochschule fur Gestalstung,Email sent by Charles Lewton-Brain on 8/8/2015: \\"Studied at the Fachhochschule fur Gestalstung in Pforzheim.\\" an art and design university in Pforzheim Germany. Lewton-Brain worked as a part-time goldsmith. During his time in the metals program, he was instructed by Klaus Ullrich, a postwar metalsmith. Ullrich was the person that helped Lewton-Brain to develop the foldforming technique. Ullrich emphasized to his students the importance of comprehending the properties of metal in order to understand how metal forms. Charles Lewton-Brain was able to develop his foldforming technique by seeing the characteristics of the metal as it is folded, unfolded, forged, rolled, annealed, and worked on. He brought about a new style of metalworking that had some connection to nature. His technique focused on the metal's natural reaction to being hammered and heated,Removed reference to Origami. Email from Charles Lewton-Brain 8/8/2016: \\"Not really influenced by origami, that was more something that other people used to describe foldforming, not me. You can do origami in metal, and I looked at it a little bit near the beginning, but in foldforming it is about plasticity\\" based on his understanding of the metals elastic and ductile characteristics that were part of his instruction by Klaus Ullrich. Lewton-Brain continued to teach the foldforming technique to people at workshops and at Alberta College of Art and Design as the Head of Metals and Jewelry, having been part of this institute since 1986. By 1991, Lewton-Brain was winning awards for the technique and in 1997 workshops demonstrating the technique were at the core of the \\"Touch the Future\\" portion of the JCK International Jewelry Show in Orlando, Florida. Applications When foldforming was first developed by Charles Lewton-Brain, it was mostly used in creative artwork or jewelry. Metalsmiths or artists turn a 2-dimensional into a 3-dimensional figure. The outcome of these 3-dimension is determined on how many times the sheet metal is folded, unfolded, annealed, and forged (hammered on an anvil). Artists like Charles Lewton-Brain have added these natural figures as a part of their art and jewelry. Jewelry, such as earrings or necklaces, can be made with foldforming. For some artists or students trying to become artists, like Ball State University graduate student Rachael Jobst, using this technique can be helpful when making leaves or flowers for an art piece.Jobst, R. (2009). Vines, Veins, and Morning Glories: An Examination of Arboreal Patterns in Relation to the Hypothesis. 1-44. There are other applications to foldforming. Manufacturers have been able to apply this process to help them produce cheaper automobiles. When processing some parts of the vehicle, like the frame and body, the metal that is used go through a process of press-based stamping, a comparatively more complicated method of producing the car's body. With foldforming, manufacturers are able to cut costs and time for manufacturing because of the reduced need for tools and additional operations required with press-based stamping. Also, with foldforming, the metal sheets used take advantage of the flexibility of the material, reducing the chance of cracks and wear. Resemblance Many of the shapes and forms that come out of foldforming resemble many things seen in nature, and utilizes laws of nature in the creation process. The most common shapes created using foldforming are flowers, leaves or horns of a ram, as these require the repeated process of folding, annealing, unfolding, and hammering of sheet metal that foldforming also involves. The process of a flower unfolding or how a leaf forms is similar between natural occurrences and foldforming. With this, artists are able to obtain a better understanding of how to incorporate nature's natural beauty into their artwork. With metalsmiths, this technique requires them to push their material to the limit so they'll be able to have a better understanding of what they will be able to make based on the material's ductility and elasticity. Another resemblance that foldforming has is the paper fold technique known as \\"origami\\". The process of folding and unfolding a flat material is seen in both metal foldforming and papering folding origami. Many of the principles and issues that come with the folding and unfolding process can be seen in origami and foldforming.Qattawi, A. (2012). Extending Origami Technique to Fold Forming of Sheet Metal Products. All Dissertations. Paper 1392. With this similarity some artists create a paper origami model of their project before working with sheet metal. The difficulty with this is that paper and sheet metal are materials with very different properties, so artist are still limited to the materials' limits of malleability. Paper material is able to bend more freely but incapable of sustaining a folded form as easily as sheet metal, and sheet metal is a thicker and tougher material to work with. Folding technique Hundreds of folds have now been categorized. Charles Lewton-Brain was able to come up with four basic steps to foldforming. * Step one: fold the sheet metal over itself. This creates the bent shape in the sheet metal. * Step two: forge (hammer) or roll the metal. By doing this, metalsmiths are either creating the main form of the figure or making the area where the metal is folded more distinctive. * Step three: anneal the metal. This is just heating the sheet metal enough for it to be easier to work with. * Step four: unfold the sheet metal revealing its form. All four steps act upon the characteristics of metals.McCreight, T., & Johnston, A. (2008). Fold Forming Charles Lewton-Brain. 1-23. Tools Techniques now include the use of traditional forging tools like various types of hammers, mallets, and anvils. Other tools consist of rolling mills, vice grips, pliers, embedding wire, other objects into the folds.McCreight, Tim, ed. Metals Technic. Brynmorgen, 1992. pp 71-87 and a heat source. The heat source can be some kind of forge, a blowtorch, or anything hot enough to anneal the metal.

Led by Artistic Director, Christopher Bell, NYCOS provides a national infrastructure for young people, teachers and choir directors to support and develop choral singing in Scotland. NYCOS activities currently include four National Choirs, a growing network of Regional Choirs across Scotland, Mini Music Makers classes and a broad range of educational projects. NYCOS also commissions and publishes a range of publications, songbooks and educational resources. Background NYCOS was founded as a single choir in 1996 by its current Artistic Director, Christopher Bell with support from the then Director of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, Richard Chester. It was felt that, whilst Scotland had national youth ensembles for orchestra, strings, jazz and brass, there was a lack of opportunity for young singers in to participate at a national level and standard. National Choirs NYCOS National Choirs comprises a total of four choirs for young people aged 10‚Äì25: * National Youth Choir of Scotland (singers aged 16‚Äì25) * NYCOS Training Choir (singers aged 16‚Äì19) * NYCOS National Boys Choir (singers aged 10‚Äì17) * NYCOS National Girls Choir (singers aged 12‚Äì17) Membership for all NYCOS National Choirs is granted by annual audition and is open to singers who are born, resident/studying in Scotland, or of Scottish descent. The basis of the Choirs' activities stems from a residential course where time is split between individual vocal coaching, musicianship sessions and sectional/full rehearsals. NYCOS became the first youth organisation to win a coveted Royal Philharmonic Society (RPS) award when its flagship National Youth Choir of Scotland won the 2012 Ensemble prize. National youth choir scoops prestigious award (Herald Scotland). Retrieved 10 November 2014. The Choir has toured to Ireland (2000), Sweden (2001), USA (2004), Hungary (2007), Germany (2010), Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia (2013), USA (2016), Belgium (2017) and the USA for a third time (2018), where the ensemble performed notably alongside the Orchestre R√©volutionnaire et Romantique in Carnegie Hall, under John Eliot Gardiner.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/arts/music/review-berlioz- gardiner-carnegie-hall.html NYCoS traditionally undertakes an international tour every three years (besides the exception of 2018), with those in the touring choir being offered a two-year membership. In the tour year, a second, non-touring group is formed named NYCoS Scotland. NYCOS Training Choir, formed in 1997 trains singers aged 16‚Äì19 who need more experience in a wider repertoire, and receive vocal and choral and individual coaching. The National Boys Choir was formed in 2002 with financial support from the Scottish Arts Council Lottery Fund. It was initially for boys with unchanged voices, but expanded in 2003 to include a changed voices section. Entry is by audition and is open for boys aged 10‚Äì16. Structured into three sections, Training Choir, National Boys Choir and Changing Voice Choir, the choir meets annually around Easter time for a residential course, followed by concerts. The choir has performed in Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Linlithgow, Londonderry, Paisley and Stirling. In 2007, NBC toured to Kendal and Dumfries giving concerts in Kendal Town Hall and the Crichton Church in Dumfries. The Choir has a repertoire including classical, sacred and Scots songs. Recent commissions include Tom Cunningham's Saga of the Seven Days and Sheena Phillips Sea Shanties. The patron of the boys choir is Scottish actor Billy Boyd. The National Girls Choir was formed in 2007. 80 singers between the ages of 12 and 16 were selected by audition from Scotland. The daily timetable was a mixture of vocal coaching, musicianship training and full choir rehearsals. They performed their first concert in the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh in April 2007. In 2010, the choir formed another section, the National Girls Training Choir. It offers girls who audition successfully, but whose voices are not yet ready for National Girls Choir, places on the National Girls Choir course. The patron of the National Girls Choir is Scottish mezzo-soprano Karen Cargill. Regional Choirs In 1998 NYCOS formed two Children's Choirs (now known as Regional Choirs), one in Livingston, West Lothian and one in Edinburgh. Each choir had approximately 60 members. Members were recruited from Primary 3 pupils (with some Primary 4 to make up numbers). Both choirs met for one hour each week and members received musicianship training for 30 minutes and sang as a choir for the remaining 30 minutes. At present there are 14 Regional Choirs: Aberdeen, Angus, Dumfries, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Inverness, Isle of Lewis, Midlothian, Perth, Renfrewshire, Stirling and West Lothian ‚Äì with a membership of over 2,000 children. The set-up of the Regional Choirs is still the same with members receiving musicianship training and singing as a choir. End of term concerts are given at Christmas and Summer. The choirs in Perth and East Dunbartonshire are distinct in that they are boys-only choirs. Education NYCOS has an educational remit and runs Kod√°ly Musicianship Training weekends for teachers, choir directors and music specialists. They run in-service days and singing workshops for schools. They also run Mini Music Makers classes across Scotland, which are musical sessions designed to introduce babies, toddlers and nursery age children and their parent/carer to music. NYCOS also produces song books and educational resources.

The area located in the approximate area of present-day Wong Tai Sin. The name now also refers to two public housing estates, Chuk Yuen North and Chuk Yuen South Estates. There is a village in proper Chuk Yuen at the junction of Shatin Pass Road and Lung Cheung Road. History The original village of Chuk Yuen was centred approximately around the current Wong Tai Sin Fire Station, beside Shatin Pass Road. During early British rule of New Kowloon, Shatin Pass Road was a road from a point from Kai Tak Airport to Shatin Pass in the north ridge via villages of Po Kong and Chuk Yuen. A forest of bamboo surrounded the village, and the village's name is derived therefrom - Chuk Yuen means bamboo garden in Chinese language. A river from the range north ran by the village west emptying into Kowloon Bay via Po Kong. In 1921, a Taoist priest built Wong Tai Sin Temple west of the village, and a Taoist group Sik Sik Yuen () was established to manage the temple at the same time. After World War II and the years around Chinese Civil War, large influx of refugees rushed into Hong Kong and built their home on the hill sides. Hong Kong Government zoned the hilly area north of the temple as Chuk Yuen Resettlement Area, which covered present-day Chuk Yuen North Estate, Chuk Yuen South Estate and Upper Wong Tai Sin Estate. In 1956, the government decided to relocate the residents of squatters and Chuk Yuen Village in the resettlement area to a high-rise residential blocks. Two Wong Tai Sin Estates, \\"Upper\\" and \\"Lower\\", were built. A special block with better in-house facilities was constructed for indigenous villagers. Originally, the Wong Tai Sin temple was threatened as it was within the development project. However, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals successfully persuaded the government to preserve the temple. The housing project of two Wong Tai Sin Estates were completed in early 1960s. The name of Wong Tai Sin gradually gains popularity over Chuk Yuen, though the temple continues to use the address of No. 2 Chuk Yuen Village. Later, the northern part of the settlement area were replaced with the Chuk Yuen North and Chuk Yuen South estates. The Chuk Yuen Bus Terminus at Chuk Yuen Road, between two estates, hosts many bus routes to other areas of Hong Kong. Nowadays, Chuk Yuen commonly refers to the estates, the bus terminus, and surroundings.

This is a \\"Suburban Coach\\" version with high backed seats and roof mounted luggage racks for longer distance routes and carries the NBC Dual Purpose half red, half white livery. The Leyland National is an integrally- constructed British step-floor single-decker bus manufactured in large quantities between 1972 and 1985. It was developed as a joint project between two UK nationalised industries ‚Äì the National Bus Company and British Leyland. Buses were constructed at a specially built factory at the Lillyhall Industrial Estate, Workington. Styling was carried out by the Italian vehicle stylist Giovanni Michelotti, previously commissioned by both Triumph (Herald, TR4, GT6, 2000/2500, 1300, Dolomite and Stag) and Scammell lorries (Routeman GRP cab). It was intended to replace all the rear-engined single-decker buses offered by British Leyland, including the AEC Swift, Bristol RE, single-deck Daimler Fleetline, Daimler Roadliner and Leyland Panther. Design Midland Red South Leyland National in Tamworth in 1986 Green Line Coaches Leyland National on Oxford Street in June 1976 East Kent Road Car Company Leyland Nationals in Dover Midland Red West Leyland National 2s Jamaica Omnibus Service Leyland Nationals at the Workington factory in August 1975 Preserved Westnederland Leyland National with an alternative windscreen model, designed to avoid glare, in The Hague in September 2002 The Leyland National was built with integral, modular construction and a rear engine. All components were designed for ease of construction and replacement. Until 1978, it was always built with a roof mounted pod at the rear, housing the heating equipment, which consequently blew warm air out at roof level. At first the pod was almost the length of a bay and appeared designed to give a Trans-Atlantic feel. In 1976 a new shorter version of the roof pod was introduced along with the battery being relocated to the front under the cab. The Leyland National was available in three lengths, the majority being 10.3m and 11.3m. It was easy to spot the longer ones as its main side windows were all the same length, on the shorter models the windows were shorter except for one in the middle (where the exit doors were on dual door variants) which was the same length as on the longer models. The third length was 10.9m, specially produced for Australian operators due to stringent axle weight limits. This used the front section of the 11.3 metre bus and the rear section of the 10.3 metre bus. One 10.9 metre bus (the prototype) was sold to a Scottish operator (Rennies of Dunfermline) and was fitted out to dual purpose specification for use on express services. The Leyland National was a simple design: all parts could be replaced. Some operators, like London Transport, bought dual door models, and then later configured some of them to single door. This was helped by the design of the body, the fact that parts were inter-changeable and that the bus was constructed using Avdelok rivets, specially designed for the National, instead of the more usual pop rivets screws or welding. The earlier vehicles were only available in a limited number of standard colours, e.g. dark red, light red, dark green, to try to match but simplify existing operators' liveries. This just predated the decision by the National Bus Company to standardise on two colours: poppy red and leaf green. The timing was such that several vehicles were delivered in dark red paint to Ribble, who repainted them poppy red before entry into service. At London Transport's insistence, London bus red was added to the colour card, and their fleet eventually amounted to over 500 examples acquired between 1973 and 1980. In 1978, Leyland brought out a simplified model (10351B/1R) intended to replace the Bristol LH which had been in production since 1967 and was a type popular in NBC companies for rural routes. It was available in a single length (10.3m) and had a revised interior that had minimal lighting and without the rear roof-mounted heating unit in previous models. Heating was under the seats, and was basic but effective. These vehicles were lighter, and this characteristic and the lower cost helped make extra sales. London Country bought quite a number of these, which other operators snapped up when London Country was broken up. The National 2 was introduced in 1979. It differed from its predecessor mainly by having a wider choice of engines, along with a new nose moulding giving it a more bulbous look and a grille to cool the new front- mounted radiator, and a revised rear end with new lights and a different engine door. =Engines= The Mark I Leyland Nationals had an 8.3-litre straight-six turbocharged Leyland 510 headless diesel engine. The Leyland 510 engine had an unusual design, in that it featured non-detachable cylinder heads; any work on the valves required the crankshaft and pistons to be removed to enable access from the cylinder bore. This engine did not prove popular with all operators, being prone to poor fuel consumption and heavy smoke production if not maintained to high standards. Some operators experimented with a different engine and found they could avoid the 510, which had the reputation of being a high maintenance unit and hard to work on. Later on a simplified model (10351B/1R) was offered, with an engine that was reduced in power to 150bhp instead of the usual 180bhp setting for the heavier duty version of the National. The National 2 was powered by initially the 0.680 engine then later the TL11, the Leyland 510 engine no longer being offered. In 1981, a Gardner 6HLXB engine was experimentally installed in accident-damaged Eastern Counties Omnibus Company National. This paved the way for many engine conversions. Leyland were taken to court by Gardner for not offering their engine as an option in the fast selling National and as a result began to offer the Leyland National 2 with Gardner engines from 1982, initially the 6HLXB and later the 6HLXCT. United Kingdom The first was delivered in March 1972 to Cumberland Motor Services (ERM35K) and the bus quickly became a common sight on British roads. Although developed for the National Bus Company (whose subsidiaries effectively had to purchase it), it was also bought by the Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, London Transport, SELNEC and British Airways (which chose the 3 door version) and other operators. =Refurbishment= In years to come, with all of the pressures created by deregulation, operators began refurbishing their Nationals for extended service, often retrofitting DAF or Volvo engines. The riveted body parts were easily replaced. In some cases a vehicle could be repaired and returned to service on the same day. All new parts were painted with grey primer so operators could paint to their requirements. A more extreme approach was offered by East Lancashire Coachbuilders with their Greenway, that saw virtually everything other than the frame and axles replaced. Exports The export version of the Leyland National was constructed in the standard way, although some were what might be called a hybrid, consisting of longer windows up to the rear axle and shorter ones after. This resulted in a 10.9 metre bus as opposed to either a 10.3 or 11.3 metre version. Given the design it was very easy to produce left hand drive vehicles and these were used as a way of generating orders. However, the Leyland National was not particularly successful in the export market - the largest export order of 450 was to Caracas, Venezuela, in 1975‚Äì76. Around 125 Leyland Nationals were shipped to Kingston, Jamaica, between 1972 and 1974 to be operated by the Jamaica Omnibus Service, a subsidiary of the British Electric Traction company. Forty were exported to Trinidad and Tobago for use by the National Bus Company. Nederlandse Spoorwegen in the Netherlands purchased 25 on behalf of their bus subsidiaries NZH, Westnederland, Centraal Nederland and Zuidooster. Problems with windscreen glare resulted in the windscreens being removed and a different version being fitted. In France, Dijon purchased six, while St √âtienne Municipality purchased 20. Singapore Bus Services received a single 11.6m dual door Leyland National 2 in February 1981 which would mostly work on bus route 143 as SBS6820L until its withdrawal in 1983, after which it was exported to Australia. In Australia, ACTION purchased 70 Nationals in 1974‚Äì75, 16 being fully assembled in England and 54 in Australia. Some were repowered with MAN engines. In 1975, Brisbane City Council purchased seven while the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board purchased 30. The Metropolitan Transport Trust purchased 63 in 1975‚Äì76 for use in Hobart. These were all 10.3 metre units, however one was rejected and its replacement was a 10.9 metre unit. Surfside Buslines were the largest Australian private bus operator with a fleet of 38 purchased new and second- hand. The chassis of the Leyland National was also sold as the Leyland B21 in limited numbers to overseas operators. Replacement In all over 7,000 Leyland Nationals were built. It was replaced by the Leyland Lynx. Survivors As a result of legislation preventing the use of step-entrance buses on normal public bus routes, no Nationals remain in service, the last major operator was Chase Bus Services, Chasetown who sold the operations to Arriva Midlands and ceased operating as a separate entity on 28 April 2007. Notably all but two retained Leyland 510 engines to the end. Over 100 Leyland Nationals have been preserved. The Workington factory has closed, though part of the building now forms part of a Stobart Group depot. Among these is the very first Leyland National for Midland Red, 101 (HHA 101L) which, preservation by First Midland Red, has recently been purchased by The Green Bus Company for further preservation. Articulated bus derivative Weybourne station in September 2005 In 1980, some underfloor-engined articulated buses with bodywork derived from the Leyland National were assembled by Charles H Roe. Railbus derivatives In the 1980s, Leyland National bus components were also used to build the following classes of railbuses for British Rail: *Class 141 *Class 142 *Class 155 (many later converted to Class 153s) Despite the best intentions, the front end of the Leyland National was not considered substantial enough to allow for a standard bus front end to be used on train carriages. The body was very similar to a National, the components used were identical but the configuration was to a different format.

Origins Clay Cole was born in Youngstown, Ohio.Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed December 2010 He became a juvenile stage and radio actor; then in 1953, at age 15, became the television host and producer of his own Saturday night teen music show, Rucker's Rumpus Room, first on WKBN-TV, then, until 1957, on WFMJ. Arriving in Manhattan in 1957, he worked first as an NBC page, then as a production assistant on the troubled quiz show Twenty One, the events at which were recreated in the 1994 film Quiz Show, directed by Robert Redford. Early television and film career In 1958, he continued his Saturday night television legacy, launching Al Rucker and the Seven Teens program on WJAR-TV, Providence, Rhode Island. Upon arrival in New York City during 1959, he was asked to change his name. He chose Clay Cole, the name of a distant cousin. His dance program became known as The Clay Cole Show. It originally was broadcast on WNTA-TV (later PBS station WNET-TV). When WNTA-TV was sold in 1963, Cole's program was picked up by New York City television station WPIX-TV, where the program became known as Clay Cole's Discotek by 1965. One of his other shows, Clay Cole at the Moon Bowl, was broadcast from the Freedomland U.S.A. theme park in The Bronx during 1963 on WPIX-TV. Chuck McCann was his announcer sidekick. Cole and this show, along with his other connections to Freedomland, are featured in the book, Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History (Theme Park Press, 2019). Clay's 1960 all-star ten-day Christmas show at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater broke the all-time house box office record. Clay was among the few white performers invited to appear at Harlem's Apollo Theater; he headlined three week-long revues, starring Fats Domino, Gladys Knight & the Pips and Chubby Checker. In 1961, he appeared as himself in the film Twist Around the Clock. During the 1960s \\"British Invasion\\", musical acts arriving from the UK often appeared on Cole's television shows before doing network shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show. The Rolling Stones and The Who were among those who first appeared on Cole's television show. Cole's show differed from American Bandstand in a few ways: while both Cole and Dick Clark had an interest in young people and their music, Cole did not hesitate to join in on his show's dance floor. He was also more confident about booking lesser-known performers and comedians for his show. Writing, producing and directing career Leaving The Clay Cole Show in 1967, Clay became a television writer - producer, involved in the production of over 3500 broadcast television shows. He is twice winner of the Emmy Award (NATAS) as \\"producer of outstanding television programming\\" in 1981 and 1982 for the Joel Siegel Academy Awards special. He producedThe Discovery of Marilyn Monroe, Play Bridge with Omar Sharif and 365 This Day In Hollywood segments. Along with David Susskind and Raysa Bonow, he created and produced the first primetime entertainment magazine People for CBS in 1979. Cole also hosted A. M. New York. He returned briefly in 1974 as the star of the first HBO-produced music special Clay Cole's 20 Years of Rock and Roll, a two-hour event taped at Rockland Community College, and as co-host of the WABC-TV weekday program, AM New York. His final professional assignment was as writer/producer/director of the television special, the 2002. Going on in the 80's having his own production company. Clay Cole Productions. Producing the music video for Otis day and the knights, besides other industrial projects. Sanremo Music Festival in Italy, featuring Britney Spears, Destiny's Child, Alicia Keys, Shakira, Kylie Minogue and other international pop divas. Retirement and death Cole retired and had been living on Oak Island since 2007, off the Cape Fear River on the North Carolina coastline. His pop culture memoir, Sh-Boom! The Explosion of Rock 'n' Roll (1953-1968), has been published by Morgan James. It has been nominated for the 2010 Association for Recorded Sound Collections Awards for Excellence in Historical Recorded Sound Research. Cole made a personal appearance at the annual Long Island Radio & TV Day in April 2010, and also at the New Jersey Rock Con later that year. Clay appeared at the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention in Newark, New Jersey in October 2010. In addition, Cole was a member of the nominating committee of the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

Her keel was laid down as Paul Tulane under Maritime Commission contract (T. Z-ET1-S-C3) by Delta Shipbuilding Company, New Orleans, Louisiana, on 28 September 1943. She was renamed Kangaroo 27 October 1943, launched on 6 November 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Rufus C. Harris, acquired by the Navy on bareboat basis 17 December, and commissioned on 20 December with Lieutenant G. D. Lawson in command. Following shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, Kangaroo departed Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on 24 January 1944, transited the Panama Canal on 28 January, and steamed to Noumea, New Caledonia, arriving 1 March. Assigned to the Service Force Pacific as a replacement for Stag (IX-128), she loaded fuel and supplies and departed for Guadalcanal on 21 March. Upon arrival 26 March, she commenced fueling operations, and for the next five months she replenishing ships in waters of the Solomon Islands. Departing Tulagi on 10 September, she sailed to the Tonga Islands, received a cargo of fuel oil, and delivered her cargo at Noumea on 5 October. For seven months she served as a shuttle and station tanker, transporting bunker oil from the Fiji Islands and Tonga Islands to bases in the New Hebrides and New Caledonia. After a voyage to New Zealand for repairs, she departed Auckland on 6 June to load fuel oil at American Samoa. Subsequently, she conducted fueling operations in the Solomon Islands, Eniwetok, and the Western Caroline Islands before arriving Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 14 August to resume duty as a station tanker. While in the Pacific Kangaroo steamed over 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) and hauled more than 38,000,000 gallons (900,000 barrels, 144,000 cubic meters) of fuel oil and hundreds of drums of lubricating oil for fighting ships of the Navy. During her service she refueled more than 80 ships, including ten aircraft carriers, 34 destroyers, 20 troop transports, 12 cargo ships, and numerous merchantmen  not to mention storage barges, oilers, and tank farms. Kangaroo departed Okinawa on 2 February 1946, for the United States. Transiting the Panama Canal on 9 March, she put into Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 April after a six-week anchorage at Lynnhaven Roads and Hampton Roads. Kangaroo decommissioned on 13 May, and the following day she was turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal.

Unpublished Book Manuscript =Athletics Kenya= Kenya is a powerful nation in Athletics, but the talent is limited to long and middle distance running. Famous Kenyan runners typically come from districts like Keiyo, Marakwet and Nandi in western Kenya. Almost all of them represent Kalenjin tribes. Jehoshaphat Kimutai is one of the AKA Legends. Kenyan Championships are held in summer, but separate trials are used to pick athletes for major international championships. Top Kenyan athletes usually attend these events, since those who skip them are likely miss major championships as well. Many leading Kenyan runners mostly compete in Europe, national championships and trials are the only event where local spectators can see them competing. Other competitions organised by AK include series of track and cross-country meetings and number of road races. Kenya hosts three annual marathon events. Nairobi Marathon is the youngest, but is now leading in competitiveness and participation. Others are Mombasa Marathon and Great Lake Marathon, which is held in Kisumu. Additionally, there is a competition known as a Lewa Marathon, which involves races equal to full (42 km) and half marathon, but it is a cross-country race and thus cannot be classified as a marathon. Nevertheless, the half marathon event of Lewa Marathon has allured many Kenyan international runner and the event has been won by Paul Tergat, Catherine Ndereba and Joyce Chepchumba in recent years. Many Kenyan runners are affiliated to governmental organisations like Armed Forces, Kenya Prisons or Kenya Police, which provide livelihood as well as training. In addition there are several private athletics clubs, like Mfae (based in Nyahururu) and Kiptenden (based in Kericho). Athletics Kenya operates an Athletics Museum in Riadha House, Nairobi.

Nevinson was one of the suffragettes who split from the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1907 to form the Women's Freedom League (WFL). She wrote many articles for the WFL journal, The Vote, and also wrote many suffrage pamphlets including A History of the Suffrage Movement: 1908-1912, Ancient Suffragettes and The Spoilt Child and the Law. Nevinson was also the first woman Justice of the Peace in London as well as serving as a Poor Law Guardian. Early life Nevinson was born Margaret Wynne Jones at Vicarage House, Lower Church Gate, Leicester, on 11 January 1858, the daughter of the Revd Timothy Jones (c.1813‚Äì1873/4) and his wife, Mary Louisa (c.1830‚Äì1888). Her father, vicar of St Margaret's Church, Leicester, was a classical scholar who taught her Latin and Greek alongside her five brothers. Her mother had more traditional notions of appropriate pursuits for her only daughter. A brief, unhappy spell in an Oxford Anglican convent school was followed by finishing school in Paris. The unexpected death of her father increased Margaret's wish to live independently. She tried governessing, then went to Cologne as a pupil teacher in a professor's family. In the early 1880s she became a classics mistress at South Hampstead High School, London. She also studied for examinations in Education, German, and Latin, becoming one of 63 women who gained the title and diploma of Lady Literate in Arts in 1882 from St Andrews University.John, Angela V. \\"Nevinson [n√©e Jones], Margaret Wynne (1858‚Äì1932), women's rights activist.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. 2004-09-23. Oxford University Press. Date of access 9 Mar. 2018.  Marriage  On 18 April 1884 in London Margaret married childhood friend, the journalist Henry Woodd Nevinson (1856‚Äì1941). They spent a year in Germany, Henry studying at University of Jena while Margaret resumed teaching English. Their daughter (Mary) Philippa, who became a talented musician, was born in Germany. After returning to London (encouraged by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett) they moved to workmen's flats in Whitechapel. Margaret taught French evening classes at Toynbee Hall and helped with St Jude's Girls' Club. She then became a rent collector in artisans' dwellings. In 1887 the Nevinsons moved to Hampstead. Their son, born in August 1889, was the artist Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson. His autobiography describes growing up as part of the Hampstead intelligentsia. His mother was \\"always a pioneer\\", from her shingled hair and hatred of lace curtains to her espousal of modern art, European outlook, and commitment to social justice (C. R. W. Nevinson, 6).C. R. W. Nevinson, Paint and prejudice (1937) In 1901 the Nevinsons bought a house in Downside Crescent, Haverstock Hill, where Margaret lived for the rest of her life. By now Margaret and Henry's lives were running along separate grooves, not least because of the latter's night newspaper work. Henry also became a war correspondent so was frequently away for months. The marriage suffered though they never formally separated.  Employment and activism  Margaret was a school manager for 25 years, initially for the London School Board in the East End, then for London County Council (north St Pancras). In 1904 she became a Hampstead poor-law guardian, determined to root out inefficiency and expose anomalies, particularly where they affected poor women. Her greatest contribution was probably not so much through the weekly meetings she attended so regularly as in publicizing the problems of the poor law. She did this through talks to women's suffrage groups, articles, and stories. In 1918 she published twenty-six tales known as Workhouse Characters. These included one story which had earlier been turned into a one-act play called In the Workhouse. Gender-specific legislation discriminating against married women was increasingly the focus of Margaret's writings whether through pamphlets such as The Legal Wrongs of Women (Women's Freedom League, 1923) or via her thinly disguised autobiographical stories, Fragments of Life (1922). An early trainee in massage, Margaret treated wounded Belgian soldiers during World War I. Although she had refused to speak on behalf of parties or causes other than suffrage prior to gaining the vote, once enfranchised she supported the Liberal Party. She also lectured on the League of Nations and became a vice-president of the Women's Peace Crusade. In 1927 she was elected to the committee of the Society of Women Journalists. Her most significant post-war public service was, however, as a pioneer female justice of the peace. Nominated by the WFL, in June 1920 she became the first woman in London to adjudicate at criminal petty sessions. With her experience and self- confessed 'passion for justice' and \\"devotion to logic\\" (M. W. Nevinson, 254)M. W. Nevinson, Life's fitful fever (1926), she again played a crucial role in Hampstead's affairs. She also visited the United States to study the American probationary system. In 1921 she was one of three women appointed to the Lord Chancellor's London county justices advisory committee.  In the Workhouse (1911)  Performed in 1911 in the Kingsway Theatre, In the Workhouse was one of the most controversial plays produced by Edy Craig's Pioneer Players as part of a triple bill with Chris St. John's The First Actress and Cicely Hamilton's Jack and Jill and A Friend (King's Hall, 1911). It is an expos√© of the iniquities of the Coverture Act, which decreed that a married woman had no separate legal existence from her husband and therefore meant that if her husband entered - or left - the workhouse, she and her children were obliged to go with him. Set in a workhouse ward, where a group of mothers, married and unmarried, look after their children, it exposes the contradictions of a system where Penelope, a respectable, secure, mother of five and unmarried is freer than respectable Mrs Cleaver who returns from her appeal to the Board of Guardians to announce that legally she has no right to leave the workhouse, eve though she has work to go to and a home available for herself and her children. The play, with its refusal to condemn vice and the unmarried mother, was either condemned for offensiveness or acclaimed for its importance. The Pall Mall Gazette compared it to the work of Eug√®ne Brieux \\"which plead for reform by painting a terrible, and perhaps overcharged, picture of things as they are... Such is the power of the dramatic pamphlet, sincerely written and sincerely acted. There is nothing to approach it in directness and force. It sweeps all mere prettiness into oblivion.\\" Two years after the play was produced, the law was changed in large measure due to Margaret's and other suffragists' campaigns. The play was revived in 1979 by Mrs Worthington's Daughters, a feminist theatre company, directed by Julie Holledge in a double-bill with Susannah Cibber's The Oracle (1752). Croft, Susan.\\"In the Workhouse.\\" Votes for Women and Other Plays, Twickenham, Aurora Metro Publications, 2009, pp. 193-209.  Role in the suffrage movement  Margaret joined a number of women's suffrage groups including the WSPU. A committed Christian, she was a member of the Church League for Women's Suffrage, spoke for the Cymric Suffrage Union (her father, originally from Lampeter, was a Welsh speaker) and was treasurer of the Women Writers' Suffrage League. Her main commitment was, however, to the Women's Freedom League (WFL). She was a founder member in 1907, became treasurer of the Hampstead branch and was widely known as a witty speaker with a good stock of stories. She frequently invoked classical and biblical themes to illustrate points. She participated in passive resistance such as the suffrage picket outside parliament. Margaret also published pamphlets through the Women's Freedom League including Ancient Suffragettes (1911) and Five Year's Struggle for Freedom: a History of the Suffrage Movement (1908-1912). Margaret's husband was also active in the suffrage movement, becoming a founder of the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement for which he wrote at least one dramatic sketch.  Final years and death  Margaret's autobiography was published in 1926. Her final years were lonely ones, plagued by depression. She died of kidney failure at her Hampstead home, 4 Downside Crescent, on 8 June 1932. She was buried on 11 June at St Stephen's Church, Rosslyn Hill, London. After Margaret's death her husband remarried, to her close friend and prominent suffragist, Evelyn Sharp.

It flows from the villages of Temple Ewell and River between which is a neighbourhood served by a station, Kearsney. It is roughly long. It originally had a wide estuary on the site of modern Dover, although today it flows into the Dover Harbour through a culvert. The estuary was a natural harbour for the Bronze Age settlers and traders in the area. The remains of a Bronze Age seagoing boat (from 3,500 years ago), was found in 1992, and it can be seen in Dover Museum. The Dour Estuary was then used as a port for the Roman town, as a natural harbour for the Roman fleet. But this was silted up in the medieval period, necessitating the construction of various artificial harbours for Dover instead. The river has been used since AD 762 to power various watermills along its route. These included eight Corn Mills and five paper mills. Buckland Mill near Buckland Bridge was one of the earliest corn mills, but has since been converted into flats. Crabble Mill is now a fully restored corn mill and museum, and the Old Mill in Kearsney is now a private house, the others have been converted for various uses.

Summary By \\"heroic age\\" the author means the era of American history in which individual initiative and enterprise constituted the primary thread in technical innovation, roughly from the early 19th century until mass production and corporate enterprise outpaced that of the individual around the time of World War I. The story of innovation is told through the biographies and inventions of thirty-two key inventors of the United States' industrial revolution, whom de Camp feels were pivotal in converting the country from an agrarian nation to an industrial one. Some of the inventors spotlighted include Robert L.

Adimari (1902‚Äì1970) was an editor, researcher, and historian of the dime novel, a class of popular fiction that thrived in the mid to late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. The term \\"dime novels\\" refers to inexpensive, cheaply produced paperbacks and serials, often romance, adventure, westerns, or detective stories. Life A prodigious collector, Adimari did extensive research on dime novels, and published many articles in Dime Novel Round-Up before 1940, and at least 20 articles between 1954 and 1964. He also wrote a piece titled \\"Saga of a Dime Novelist\\" which appeared in American Book Collector in early 1935. Through correspondence with fellow dime novel historian and Dime Novel Round-Up editor Ralph F. Cummings, Adimari acquired the letters and notebooks of William J. Benners (1863-1940), a dime novel historian, author, and agent, and wrote a biography of Benners for the DNRU. Building upon Benners's work identifying dime novel authors, Adimari compiled detailed lists of authors and pseudonyms, titles, and publishers, definitively solving several mysteries about dime novel authorship. Adimari was born Raphael Adimare on October 19, 1902. He lived in the New York City area for most of his life, including Mount Vernon and Suffolk. In addition to his work on dime novels, he co-edited a 1936 collection of Walt Whitman's essays, titled New York Dissected. Adimari died November 1970 in Suffolk, New York.

KIT was created in 2009 when the University of Karlsruhe (), founded in 1825 as a public research university and also known as the \\"Fridericiana\\", merged with the Karlsruhe Research Center (), which had originally been established in 1956 as a national nuclear research center (, or KfK).Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany): KIT is a member of the TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology.TU9 As part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative KIT was one of three universities which were awarded excellence status in 2006. In the following \\"German Excellence Strategy\\" KIT was awarded as one of eleven \\"Excellence Universities\\" in 2019. KIT is among the leading technical universities in Germany and Europe and established the first German faculty for computer science in 1972. , six Nobel laureates are affiliated with KIT. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is well known for many inventors and entrepreneurs who studied or taught there, including Heinrich Hertz, Karl Friedrich Benz and the founders of SAP SE.  History  Fridericiana, founded in 1825 The University of Karlsruhe was founded as a polytechnical school () on 7 October 1825. It was modelled on the √âcole polytechnique in Paris. In 1865, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden raised the school to the status of a , an institution of higher education. Since 1902 the university has also been known as the Fridericiana in his honour. In 1885, it was declared a , or institute of technology, and in 1967, it became an , a full university, which gave it the right to award regular doctorate degrees. It had hitherto only been allowed to award doctorates in engineering, identified as , a right bestowed on all technical institutes in 1899. The Victoriapensionat I The University of Karlsruhe is one of the leading German institutions in computer science. A central computer laboratory was founded in 1966. The department of informatics was established three years later, along with the first regular course in informatics.http://www.informatik.kit.edu/719.php 'History of the department of informatics\\" On 2 August 1984, the university received Germany's first email. The (Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research) was founded at the university in 1985. The university also cooperated extensively with the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Research Centre), and this relationship was formalised on 6 April 2006 when Professor Horst Hippler and Dr. Dieter Ertmann from the University of Karlsruhe, and Professor Manfred Popp and Assistant Jur. Sigurd Lettow from Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe signed a contract for the foundation of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The name was inspired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the leading technical university in the United States. In February 2008, the merger of the university and the research centre to form KIT was agreed by the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Germany's federal government.Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany): The necessary state law was passed on 8 July 2009.Landtag of Baden-W√ºrttemberg: KIT was formally established on 1 October 2009. The main reason for establishing KIT was to strengthen Karlsruhe's position in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, which offered elite universities grants of up to 50 million euros per annum. This aim was not achieved. While the University of Karlsruhe was chosen for the initiative in 2006/2007, KIT failed to secure a place in 2012. It did, however, attract funds from other sources. In 2008, Hans-Werner Hector, co- founder of SAP, raised 200 million euros to support researchers at the institute. (Hector is the only founder of SAP who did not graduate from the University of Karlsruhe; he was given an honorary doctorate for his support of intellectually gifted children in 2003.) Institute of Electric Engineering at KIT  Campus  = Campus Nord = KIT locations in Germany and Karlsruhe The (Campus North), the former , was founded in 1956 as (Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre). Initial activities focused on Forschungsreaktor 2 (FR2), the first nuclear reactor built by Germany. With the decline of nuclear energy activities in Germany, Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe directed its work increasingly towards alternative areas of basic and applied sciences. This change is reflected in the change of name from to with the subheading (technology and environment) added in 1995. This subheading was replaced by (in the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers) in 2002. Campus Nord is the site of the main German national nuclear engineering research centre and the Institute for Transuranium Elements. Also at the site is a nanotechnology research centre and the neutrino experiment KATRIN. Campus Nord also hosts a 200-metre-tall guyed mast for meteorological measurements.  Organization and administration  = Faculties = The university has eleven faculties: # Mathematics # Physics # Chemistry and Biology # Humanities and Social sciences # Architecture # Civil engineering, Geology, and Ecological Sciences # Mechanical Engineering # Chemical and Process Engineering # Electrical engineering and Information Technology # Computer Science # Economics and Management  Academic profile  = Education = The university offers a great range of education options with such possibilities as cross studies and work-study programs. A studium generale (general studies) program was established in 1949, allowing students to attend lectures not directly pertaining their study field. In the first semesters of a course, education tends to be theoretically oriented at KIT, with a high concentration on mathematics for engineering and natural science courses. It is possible to choose between practical and theoretical topics in later semesters. Since the winter semester of 2008/2009, KIT has completed the transition from Diplom degrees to bachelor's degrees and master's degrees. Students already enrolled for a Diplom degree when the transition began were allowed to finish their studies, but new students are only allowed to apply for a bachelor's or master's degree. Admission policies differ among the departments. While students are chosen by the quality of their school degree and their extracurricular activities for courses such as industrial engineering and management (27% of admissions in 2008), other departments do not preselect for their courses, including physics, informatics, and meteorology. All courses require a minimum number of passed exams, called or orientation assessments, in the first three semesters before students are allowed to complete their course. There is a substantial drop-out rate in some engineering courses due to the immense study required to meet the prerequisites. The Zentrum f√ºr Angewandte Kulturwissenschaft und Studium Generale (Centre for Applied Culture and General Studies) was founded in 1989 as a central institution to support students engaged in interdisciplinary study. Nowadays, it offers specialised qualifications in the fields of \\"Leadership and Entrepreneurship\\", \\"Media - Culture - Communication\\", \\"Internationalisation and Intercultural Decision- making and Responsibility\\", \\"Diversity Management\\", and \\"European Integration and Identity Studies\\", as well as the classical studium generale.

He made nine Winston Cup Series starts with a best finish of 12th. He made his first start in 1974 as a 17-year-old and raced until 1980. He is currently the owner of Race Engines Plus LLC and is the son of former NASCAR driver Buddy Arrington. Arrington was a partner in Bobby Hamilton Racing. Joey Arrington started Arrington Manufacturing and Arrington Engines in 2000. After selling his interests in both entities, he moved the majority of his business ventures to Concord, NC. In 2012 Joey, once again, owned a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Team under the Toyota banner with REP providing the engines. Biography Arrington is the son of Buddy and Jeanette Arrington, and often was present at his father's races. His interests in engines and car tuning were sparked by Petty Enterprises engine builder Maurice Petty, and Joey would tweak his skills in the Petty shop in Level Cross. After graduating high school in 1975, the younger Arrington became the crew chief and engine builder for his father's racing efforts. Arrington was an integral part of Dodge's return to stock car racing, building engines and providing parts for Dodge teams for their return to ARCA in 1991, Trans-Am, and the Craftsman Truck Series in 1995. Arrington Manufacturing / Race Engines Plus In 2000, Arrington founded Arrington Manufacturing, Inc. in Martinsville, Virginia, also operating as Arrington Engines. Arrington built engines for Dodge truck teams Bobby Hamilton Racing and Ultra Motorsports, winning championships in 2004 and 2005 with Ted Musgrave and Bobby Hamilton. In 2009, with Dodge pulling support from the Truck Series, Arrington shifted its focus and expanded into the aftermarket parts industry. That same year, they began providing engines to rookie Cup team Tommy Baldwin Racing, a team he had worked with in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. In 2011, Arrington began his new entity, called Race Engines Plus and located in the auto racing hub of Concord, North Carolina. The company builds race engines for teams in NASCAR, NHRA, and SCCA.

He also represented Sweden at the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico and the European Championship in 1964. Persson was the first of five Scandinavian imports signed by Dundee United manager Jerry Kerr who was one of the first managers in Scotland to tap into the Scandinavian market to find talented and experienced players at an affordable price. Persson moved to Tannadice from √ñrgryte IS on 2 December 1964, the first overseas player to join the club. As there was no professionalism in Swedish football in the 1960s United did not have to pay a transfer fee. He made his debut along with the Danish striker Finn D√∏ssing. United had made a poor start to the 1964-65 First Division season and appeared to be heading towards relegation, which would have undone the great work done by Kerr since leading the team to promotion in 1959-60. Since then the club had enjoyed their longest ever spell in the top flight and were becoming established as a permanent fixture in the First Division although relegation in the Spring of 1965 may have doomed the club to obscurity. Kerr had taken a gamble in bringing players with no experience in Scottish football, like Mogens Berg and Lennart Wing, to the club to help fight relegation. The gamble paid off, and Persson‚Äôs classy play on the wing and pinpoint crosses being complementary to D√∏ssing's huge goal scoring talent. United managed mid-table security by the end of the season. In the following 1965-66 season Persson played a crucial role in helping United to finish in 5th place in the league qualifying for Europe for the first time. The 1966-67 was to be Persson's last at Tannadice, but arguably his most successful. Scoring 11 goals in 29 appearances from the wing as well as helping United to two victories over FC Barcelona and one over Juventus in the Fairs Cup. Persson was immensely popular at United playing in 101 matches and scoring 17 goals. He has the distinction (shared with fellow countryman Lennart Wing) of being the first Dundee United player to win a full international cap. He won a total of 9 Sweden caps while with United. He moved to Rangers in May 1967 where he played 113 games, scored 31 goals (often spectacular ones) and won 6 caps, representing his country at the World Cup in 1970. Later that year he returned to √ñrgryte IS and went on to play for Sweden at the 1974 World Cup.

However, it was not until the practice of economic reform and opening that Rui'an regained its momentum. The people of Rui'an have been pioneers in many fields, especially in the development of China's market economy in the form of joint-stock system. They set up the household contract responsibility system which would encourage the citizens to take lead in the household industries, and they tried their best to sell their products. Consequently, Rui'an experienced fast economic development. The government induced the rural entrepreneurs and shareholders to cooperate effectively. Many kinds of economic systems have been introduced in Rui'an, making regional development speedier. One such system is the famous ‚ÄúWenzhou Pattern‚Äú, which became well known both in China and abroad. In 2005, Rui'an ranked 39th place in comprehensive economic strength among the first 100 counties and cities of china. In the 20 square kilometer economic development zone at the provincial level, there is enthusiasm for capital investment in building Rui'an into a new urban area with comprehensive development of industry, trade, science and technology. Rui'an is also known for its production of plastics and auto accessories. Transportation The infrastructure of Rui'an has improved, with an ever-quickening pace of urbanization. Now, it has modernized traffic control, transportation and communication systems. The Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport, a 10,000-ton seaport and the local railway station are each less than 30 kilometers from the city proper. The coastal highway and the No. 104 state highway which run through the city, and the Rui'an station on the Wenzhou‚ÄìFuzhou railway are a few significant examples of developments in transportation in Rui'an. Resources As a coastal city, Rui'an is rich in natural resources and has several salt mines. Situated about 100 nautical miles away from the estuary of Feiyunjiang, there lies the seabed rich in crude oil and natural gas, which are now being prospected and planned to be excavated.

His younger brother, Wilson Worsdell (1850‚Äì1920), was also a locomotive engineer. T. C. Worsdell had become a Quaker at some point between 1812 and 1816, and his descendants, including Nathaniel, William and Wilson, were brought up in the Quaker faith. William was born at his parents' house in Liverpool on 14 January 1838. He began school at the age of two, and in 1847 was sent as a boarder to Ackworth, a Quaker school in Yorkshire, where he remained until 1852. Career He worked at the Crewe Works of the LNWR under John Ramsbottom but in 1865 moved to the United States to the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1871 he was invited by Francis William Webb to return to Crewe. In 1881 he was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway, but in 1885 moved to the North Eastern Railway, being replaced at the GER by James Holden. He retired from the NER on 1 October 1890 due to ill health and was replaced by his younger brother Wilson Worsdell. He died in Arnside on 28 June 1916.

It is named after its creator, Sol Spiegelman, of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who first described it in 1965. Description Spiegelman introduced RNA from a simple bacteriophage QŒ≤ (QŒ≤) into a solution which contained QŒ≤'s RNA replicase, some free nucleotides, and some salts. In this environment, the RNA started to be replicated. After a while, Spiegelman took some RNA and moved it to another tube with fresh solution. This process was repeated. Shorter RNA chains were able to be replicated faster, so the RNA became shorter and shorter as selection favored speed. After 74 generations, the original strand with 4,500 nucleotide bases ended up as a dwarf genome with only 218 bases. This short RNA sequence replicated very quickly in these unnatural circumstances. M. Sumper and R. Luce of Eigen's laboratory replicated the experiment, except without adding RNA, only RNA bases and QŒ≤ replicase. They found that under the right conditions the QŒ≤ replicase can spontaneously generate RNA which evolves into a form similar to Spiegelman's Monster. However, Chetverin and colleagues later showed that the 'spontaneous' RNA generation was due to environmental RNA contamination. Eigen built on Spiegelman's work and produced a similar system further degraded to just 48 or 54 nucleotides‚Äîthe minimum required for the binding of the replication enzyme, this time a combination of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase.

The service provides helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) and fixed-wing air ambulance operations. Dedicated planes are provided at six airports, and helicopters at 11 hospitals. In addition the service depends on the state Search and rescue helicopters for a full national coverage. The fixed-wing aircraft and HEMS helicopters are operated by the private companies Lufttransport and Norsk Luftambulanse on contract for the Air Ambulance Service. The rescue helicopters are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force 330 squadron History Air ambulance services in Norway have been operated by private companies and the military since the 1920s, but the first dedicated service came in 1972 when the Air Force 330 squadron was equipped with Westland Sea King helicopters. The helicopters were purchased by the ministry of justice while they were to be operated by the Air Force. In 1973 the Norwegian government started looking at possible ways to organise an air ambulance service in Norway. Before the government had made a decision, the foundation Norsk Luftambulanse had been founded in 1977 and provided one helicopter from its base at L√∏renskog. In 1983 the government started buying services from the foundation, and in 1988 a nationwide air ambulance service was started where the government bought services from private companies. By 1993 three companies had established themselves on the domestic air ambulance marked in Norway: Norsk Luftambulanse, Airlift and Lufttransport. In 2002 Norsk Luftambulanse bought the air ambulance operation from Airlift, and merged the operations. In April 2006 the Air Ambulance Service has extended its contracts with Norsk Luftambulanse and Lufttransport until 2014.

It uses the defunct Caseros Prison of Buenos Aires, Argentina and its demolition as raw materials. Aparecido is the past participle for the Spanish verb aparecer - to appear. Its second meaning is apparition or ghost. It may also refer in an oblique way to Argentina's Dirty War, in which an estimated 30,000 people, \\"Desaparecidos\\" were disappeared between 1976 and 1981 by the military junta, many of them thrown from airplanes into the Rio Plate. Sixteen Tons, the name of a popular song written in the late 1940s, referred to the amount of coal a miner was expected to load in a day, but in this context may refer to the amount of glass broken out through the installation, or de-installation, process. 80,000 tons is the approximate weight of the entire building, and the debris that the demolition produced. The demolition On a basic level, the demolition of the prison, contracted out by the city government of Buenos Aires to the Argentine military, was the seed for the artwork. The building was slated for demolition in 2001, but the process was subject to various legal, environmental and bureaucratic roadblocks. The original plan was to implode the building in three steps. But the implosion was stopped at the last minute by a group of neighbors concerned about the possibility of damaging environmental effects, including asbestos poisoning and the possibility of driving millions of rats out of the tunnels underneath the prison. Caseros was demolished by mechanical means floor by floor from the top down between 2003 and 2008. The cost of demolishing the prison, and thus the budget for the artwork, was estimated at somewhere between one and three million dollars.  The grids  The window grids on the north end of the former prison provided the locus and point of entry for the work. Each grid was approximately tall and wide. Breaking out certain windows, Wulsin created faces in each of the 48 outer grids on the building. Each grid consisted of 11 x 19 (209) circular semi-opaque windows, eight inches (203 mm) in diameter. The windows that remained reflected the light of the sky, the sun and the moon, producing images from certain angles that were completely a function of space and light‚Äîthe dark interior space of the prison, and the light shining through the optically reflective space of the remaining windows. The pictorial space of each image was directed at different points on the ground where the sun reflecting in the windows was visible. The viewing angles changed throughout the year as the sun's elevation in the sky changed. In addition to the 48 outer window grids, there were also 48 grids facing inward, directly opposite the outer grids. They didn't reflect the light of the sun from any possible viewing angles on the street, but the artist worked with them as well, using morse code to embed messages in the window grids. The window grids were already in various stages of decomposition when Wulsin found the building, with almost a third of the total number of windows already broken out by inmates during various prison riots when the jail was still in use. The cycle of appearance and disappearance that took place according to the daily, monthly and yearly lunar and solar cycles, and the position of the potential viewer was underscored at a larger magnitude by the demolition process, which consisted in the removal of the building from the top down, floor by floor. The demolition lasted until March 2008, with the majority of the rubble taken to a fill in the River Plate at Costanera Norte near Jorge Newbury Airport. After discovering the prison in January 2006, while exploring the neighborhood of Parque Patricios, where he'd recently moved from New York City, Wulsin spent four months navigating the bureaucracies of the national and city governments of Argentina and Buenos Aires, respectively, to gain authorization to enter the building and carry out the onsite work. The resolution authorizing the project was finally signed on Friday, June 16 (Bloomsday), 2006 by Minister of Public Works of the city of Buenos Aires, Juan Schiavi. The security tarp made by Wulsin to direct broken glass back inside the building was blue and white, and painted with the hot air balloon logo of the local Parque Patricios soccer team Huracan. The five weeks of onsite work were completed on Marcel Duchamp's birthday, July 28. But the project itself was ongoing through the entire demolition process of the building.

On electric clocks such as quartz clocks, the music is usually generated using an electronic sound module; Seiko and Rhythm Clock are known for their battery-powered musical clocks, which frequently feature flashing lights, automatons and other moving parts designed to attract attention while in motion. Most of these quartz musical clocks utilize either FM synthesis or sample-based synthesis technology for sound generation to produce high- fidelity and complex music, similar to the sound generation methods of electronic musical instruments. One of the earliest known domestic musical clocks was constructed by Nicholas Vallin in 1598, and it currently resides in the British Museum in London. Elaborate large-scale musical clocks with automatons are often installed in public places and are widespread in Japan. Unlike conventional electronic musical clocks, these clocks plays pre-recorded music samples, instead of using programmed sound synthesis.

' translates into \\"the Great Lynx\\". It has the head and paws of a giant cat but is covered in scales and has dagger-like spikes running along its back and tail. Mishipeshu calls Michipicoten Island in Lake Superior his home and is a powerful creature in the mythological traditions of some Native American tribes, particularly Anishinaabe tribes, the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi, of the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States. In addition to the Anishinaabeg, Innu also have Mishibizhiw stories. To the Algonquins, the underwater panther was the most powerful underworld being. The Ojibwe traditionally held them to be masters of all water creatures, including snakes. Some versions of the Nanabozho creation legend refers to whole communities of water lynx. Some archaeologists believe that underwater panthers were major components of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex of the Mississippian culture in the prehistoric American Southeast. Name In the Ojibwe language, this creature is sometimes called ', ', ', ', ', ', or ', which translates as \\"Great Lynx\\",Freelang Ojibwe Dictionary or ' (\\"Gitche-anahmi-bezheu\\"), which translates as \\"the fabulous night panther\\".\\"The fabulous night panther\\" is a translation from Anishinaabe language into French to German, which then was translated into English. The direct translation would be something closer to \\"The greatly revered lynx.\\" See Freelang Ojibwe Dictionary However, it is also commonly referred to as the \\"Great underground wildcat\\" or \\"Great under-water wildcat.\\" It is the most important of the underwater animals for the Ojibwa. Description Pictographs of a ' as well as two giant serpents and a canoe, from Lake Superior Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Attributed to the Ojibwe. In mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes, underwater panthers are described as water monsters that live in opposition to the Thunderbirds, masters of the powers of the air. Underwater Panthers are seen as an opposing yet complementary force to the Thunderbirds, and they are engaged in eternal conflict. The underwater panther was an amalgam of parts from many animals: the body of a wild feline, often a cougar or lynx; the horns of deer or bison; upright scales on its back; occasionally feathers; and parts from other animals as well, depending on the particular myth. Underwater panthers are represented with exceptionally long tails, occasionally with serpentine properties. The creatures are thought to roar or hiss in the sounds of storms or rushing rapids. ' were said to live in the deepest parts of lakes and rivers, where they can cause storms. Some traditions believed the underwater panthers to be helpful, protective creatures, but more often they were viewed as malevolent beasts that brought death and misfortune. They often need to be placated for safe passage across a lake. As late as the 1950s, the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians performed a traditional ceremony to placate the Underworld Panther and maintain balance with the Thunderbird. When ethnographer Johann Georg Kohl visited the United States in the 1850s, he spoke with a Fond du Lac chief, who showed Kohl a piece of copper kept in his medicine bag. The chief said it was a strand of hair from the ', and thus considered extremely powerful. Copper ' is known for guarding the vast amounts of copper in Lake Superior and the Great Lakes Region. Indigenous people mined copper long before the arrival of Europeans to the area. Later, during the 17th century, missionaries of the Society of Jesus arrived in the Great Lakes Region. By that time, swiping copper from the region was extremely taboo and forbidden by the Ojibwa tribe. It was even worse to take it from the Great Lynx's home, Michipicoten Island; this was considered to be stealing from Mishipeshu himself. Purported encounters There are a few stories of encounters with this great beast. A Jesuit missionary named Claude Dablon told a story about four Ojibwa Indians who embarked on a journey to the home of ' to take some copper back to their home, and use it to heat water. The very second they pushed off and backed into the water with their canoe, the eerie voice of the water panther surrounded them. The water panther came growling after them, vigorously accusing them of stealing the playthings of his children. All four of the Indians died on the way back to their village, the last one surviving just long enough to tell the tale of what had happened in his final moments before he died. Depictions in art The underwater panther is well represented in pictograms. Historical Anishnaabe twined and quilled men's bags often feature an underwater panther on one panel and the Thunderbird on the other. Norval Morrisseau (Ojibwe) painted underwater panthers in his Woodlands style artworks, contemporary paintings based on Ojibwe oral history and cosmology. The emblem has been embellished, and appears as a decorative motif on muskets. The Canadian Museum of History includes an underwater panther in its coat of arms. Alligator Effigy Mound. In 2003, archaeologist Brad Lepper suggested that the Alligator Effigy Mound in Granville, Ohio represents the underwater panther. Lepper posits that early European settlers, when learning from Native Americans that the mound represented a fierce creature that lived in the water and ate people, mistakenly assumed that the Native Americans were referring to an alligator. In popular culture The Grimm episode \\"Mishipeshu\\" involves the possession of a young Native American by an underwater panther.

Constructed in 1909 and 1910 between the towns of Armstead, Montana, and Salmon, Idaho, the G&P; served mining and agricultural areas in Lemhi County, Idaho, and Beaverhead County, Montana. The line was financially backed by the Northern Pacific Railway, and later became its subsidiary. Never financially successful, the G&P; ceased operations in 1939, and the railroad was dismantled the following year. Planning and construction A train of the Gilmore & Pittsburgh Railroad pauses at the railway's depot in Leadore, Idaho, August 1912. During the first decade of the 20th Century Lemhi County, in the remote Salmon River country of central Idaho, was seeing both increased agricultural development and substantial, renewed mining activity. The area was part of one of the largest contiguous blocks of land not served by a railroad at that time, and consequently there was significant interest in the prospect of building a railway line to (or through) the region. The desire for a railroad was perhaps most strongly felt by those promoting the county's mining developments, although a variety of existing railway companies also studied the prospects of the area. The Northern Pacific Railway (NP) gave Lemhi County particular attention, envisioning a new transcontinental route that would veer southward from existing NP lines in Montana, cross into Idaho via Bannock Pass, and then follow the rugged Salmon River canyon westward across the state. These dreams began translating to action in 1907 when a group of Pennsylvania businessmen led by W. A. McCutcheon incorporated the Gilmore and Pittsburgh Railroad. McCutcheon envisioned a railroad running westward from a connection with the Oregon Short Line Railroad at Armstead, Montana. The line would enter Lemhi County via Bannock Pass, and continue to the Lemhi River valley. In the valley, branch lines would run upstream to the promising mining camp of Gilmore, and downstream to the county seat of Salmon. Soon, McCutcheon was able to interest NP officials in his plan, since a completed G&P; could form a basis for a future NP line down the Salmon River. The NP assisted in the initial survey of the G&P; route, and later agreed to financially and materially support the G&P;'s construction. A contract for construction of the G&P; grade was awarded in March, 1909, and work began in earnest the following month. Construction was pursued in earnest throughout the following year, working west from Armstead, and the tracklayers reached Salmon on April 25, 1910. The completed line was in length, and was largely built to the mainline standards of the NP. A golden spike celebration was held in Salmon that May 18, even though portions of the line‚Äîincluding the tunnel under Bannock Pass‚Äîwere still being completed. Regular passenger and freight service on the G&P; began soon thereafter. Optimism and rumors concerning further expansion of the G&P; persisted through 1910. McCutcheon had promised that the line would be extended northward from Armstead to Dillon, Montana that year, the first step in completing a connection to the NP's trackage at nearby Twin Bridges. No further construction took place, however, in part due to G&P; legal difficulties in securing right-of-way between Armstead and Dillon. Simultaneously, though, the NP began to realize the engineering difficulties and limited economic potential of its proposed Salmon River route, and local G&P; officials began to discover that the local traffic potential was actually far less than anticipated. Consequently, the hopes for future expansion of the G&P; soon faded, and the line was never extended beyond either Armstead or Salmon. Route Public timetable of the Gilmore & Pittsburgh, revised to 1935, listing the station stops along the route. The route of the G&P; was remote, thinly populated, and often rugged. The line began at the small hamlet of Armstead, Montana, a station stop on the Oregon Short Line Railroad's route between Idaho Falls, Idaho and Butte, Montana. (The Oregon Short Line was a long-time subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, and was later absorbed into that system.) Armstead was in a high valley of the Beaverhead River, in a region known for livestock grazing. The G&P; maintained a small yard there, and it was the site of the railroad's corporate office. From Armsted, the railway headed almost due west, traversing a thinly-populated ranching region known as Horse Prairie. The area provided additional livestock traffic for the railroad, and there were mines in the nearby mountains. Substantial areas of cut and fill were required as the railroad ascended the prairie. The railroad curved southward near the western end of Horse Prairie. and began its ascent of Bannock Pass. Bannock Pass, on the Idaho-Montana border and the Continental Divide, was by far the most substantial obstacle encountered by the G&P.; The pass itself is at an elevation of , some higher than the center of Horse Prairie. Temporary trackage was built over the top of the pass during the G&P;'s construction, but a tunnel beneath the pass was clearly needed for the railway's permanent use. Since a tunnel to completely bypass the heavy grades of the pass was prohibitively expensive, the railroad compromised by boring a shorter, tunnel at the elevation. To bring the tracks to the elevation of the tunnel, the railroad line included a switchback on each side of the summit; trains ascending the pass would pull into the first switchback, run backwards through the summit tunnel, and then reverse direction again at the switchback on the opposite side. Descending Bannock Pass, the railroad followed a narrow canyon into Idaho's Lemhi Valley and the small agricultural community of Leadore, some from Armstead. The G&P;'s repair shops were at Leadore, and it also marked a junction point for the railway. The main line continued northwest from Leadore for another , following the broad valley and the Lemhi River downstream through fertile farming and ranching land to the county seat of Salmon. Salmon was the line's terminus, and by far the largest town on the G&P; route, with a 1910 population of 1,434. The only branch line operated by the G&P; began at Leadore and headed southeast, following the Lemhi River valley upstream about to the town of Gilmore, near the upper end of the valley. Gilmore in 1910 was the center of a prosperous silver and lead mining district, and was thus a major source of early traffic for the railroad. Operating history A Gilmore & Pittsburgh train ascending the western approach to Bannock Pass, August 1912. When the G&P; began service in 1910 the railroad owned a total of 8 steam locomotives, 16 passenger cars, 250 freight cars, a rotary snowplow, and other miscellaneous pieces of equipment; except for some of the freight cars, all equipment was acquired second-hand. When service began that May, the G&P; scheduled a tri-weekly passenger train between Armstead and Salmon, leaving Armstead on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and returning on the following days. Freight trains also operated on most days. Traffic levels proved lower than expected, however, and in 1913 the separate freight and passenger services were replaced by a tri-weekly mixed train, carrying both freight and passenger equipment. Both passenger and freight traffic declined in later years, and beginning in 1922 mixed train service was partially supplanted by a Brill railbus, a self-propelled vehicle designed to carry passengers and small freight shipments. For most of the 1920s, the railbus operated between Salmon and Gilmore, while the tri-weekly mixed continued between Salmon and Armstead. In 1931, the G&P; borrowed a second, larger railbus from the Northern Pacific, and used it to provide a daily-except-Sunday roundtrip between Armstead and Salmon. The mixed was discontinued at that time, and freight trains began operating only as required, usually about once a week. Service on the Gilmore branch was more dependent on the output of the district's mines, and as they declined and ultimately closed rail service to Gilmore dropped correspondingly. The Gilmore branch was largely out of service by the 1930s. The railroad's equipment roster was significantly reduced over the years, as well, because of a lack of traffic and a need to conserve expenses. The majority of the line's passenger and freight cars, and all but two of the locomotives, were gone by the early 1930s. Operations of the railroad were directed by its President and General Manager, W. N. Bichler (1881‚Äì1955). Bichler, who lived in Armstead, managed the railroad throughout its entire corporate history, from construction to abandonment. Decline and abandonment Traffic levels on the G&P; never began to reach the optimistic expectations of the line's backers, and by the early 1910s it was clear that they never would. The railroad's lack of economic viability was realized as early as 1913, when the G&P;'s substantial construction indebtedness (nearly $6,000,000) was written off by the Northern Pacific in exchange for full ownership of the line. Despite continual efforts to economize, the railroad lost money throughout much of its existence. The railroad's prospects worsened in the 1920s, as the Gilmore mines declined and eventually closed, and in the 1930s as improved local roadways made auto traffic to and within the region easier. By the late 1930s it was clear that the G&P;'s days were numbered. Early in 1939 the railroad announced that it was out of money and would cease operating effective that May 1. The moribund railroad sat unused until the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the line's abandonment in 1940, and the track was removed later that year. Remnants While much of the physical evidence of the G&P; has disappeared since the railroad's abandonment, numerous traces of the route still remain visible in the 21st Century. The line's eastern terminus at Armstead is now beneath the waters of Clark Canyon Reservoir. Elsewhere, though, most of the railroad's grade in Montana remains readily visible, as does the former alignment over Bannock Pass. Less of the old G&P; grade between Leadore and Salmon is evident today, due to agricultural and highway development, as the highway is on the G&P; right of way for most of the way from Leadore to Salmon. The Bannock Pass tunnel remains visible, although the bore has partially collapsed. Gilmore has long been a ghost town. The only major G&P; building to survive in 2006 is the former freight house at Leadore, A modern structure nearby (serving as the town's community center) is a replica of the former Leadore depot building. Several derelict railway cars once used on the G&P; still exist on farms and ranches along the railroad's former route.

Daniel was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. His family moved to New York City when he was a boy, and he remained there throughout his career. He attended the City College of New York, where he managed the basketball team. Daniel received his first writing assignment with the New York Herald in 1909 at the age of 19. He decided to use a single-name byline, \\"By Daniel\\", because editors in the early 20th century were concerned that anti-Semitism would hurt newspaper sales if he used his Jewish surname. 1920s City College Basketball Team, 1910. Daniel is in the back row wearing a suit. By 1924, he had settled at the New York Telegram, where he remained for the next forty years. In 1925, he won Best Story of the Year from the Baseball Writers' Association of America for his portrayal of Walter Johnson's loss in the seventh game of the Washington Senators/Pittsburgh Pirates World Series match-up. In the early 1920s, Daniel helped start The Ring with Nat Fleischer. He was a prolific contributor and editor throughout The Ring's history and could be seen behind his desk at The Ring when he was well past the age of 80. In addition to his daily columns for the New York Telegram (later World Telegram then World Telegram and Sun), Daniel wrote weekly columns for The Sporting News, contributing more words to that publication than any other writer in its history. 1930s From 1930 through the 1960s, Daniel was a frequent contributor to Baseball Magazine and SPORT, along with other sporting publications of the day. His patriotic articles during World War II earned him wide praise. He was one of the first writers to identify the potential of both Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, extolling their virtues before either had swung a major league bat. In 1930, Daniel was elected president of the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. That year, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker made Daniel sports chairman of his Committee for Relief of the Unemployed. The committee organized the first college basketball games in Madison Square Garden and raised the equivalent of 5 million dollars between 1930 and 1933. Walker presented a citation to Daniel at a testimonial dinner held in his honor, the first time a private citizen had been so-honored by the city. Also in 1930, Daniel helped convince Babe Ruth to sign his record US$80,000 contract with the New York Yankees. Ruth had been holding out for more money and had threatened to boycott spring training in Saint Petersburg, Florida. Daniel helped Ruth come to the decision to sign by reminding him that many of his fans were out of work and selling apples on street corners back home in New York City. Later in 1930, Daniel published Babe Ruth, Idol of the American Boy. This early biography of The Babe was developed from material Daniel had published in a series of feature stories in the New York Telegram. It included a foreword to boys from The Babe admonishing them to \\"do everything in moderation\\"! 1940s Starting in the 1940s, his \\"Ask Daniel\\" column ran in the World Telegram every Tuesday. Daniel answered thousands of baseball questions, becoming one of the game's leading experts and historians. Each spring, Daniel put his reputation on the line by predicting how the eight teams in each league would finish. Cartoonist Willard Mullin captured the audacity of these predictions in charming caricatures. Daniel was an accomplished speaker and raconteur. He had a rasping voice and a biting wit, which made him a popular choice as master of ceremonies for sports dinners and roasts. Daniel was official scorer for more than twenty games during Joe DiMaggio's 1941 hitting streak. His decisions are still criticized more than 60 years later, but Daniel maintained throughout his life that he called each play as he saw it. Shortly after Babe Ruth's death in 1948, Daniel wrote The Real Babe Ruth, his second biography of the Babe, which contained many of his personal recollections from having been friend and advisor to Babe Ruth. 1970s In 1972, Daniel received baseball's highest honor for a writer, the J. G. Taylor Spink Award at the Baseball Hall of Fame. In his acceptance speech, he thanked the players and the fans for \\"giving him the medium of a wonderful career\\". He mused that without baseball, he would have ended up as a doctor and assured the audience that \\"Had I been a doctor, I would have made house-calls\\". At the age of 86, Daniel was still a relevant contributor to the history of New York City sports. In 1976, he co-authored \\"Yankee Stadium Then and Now\\", a feature article in The New York Times. Daniel was a noted bibliophile and amassed a significant collection of first editions, befriending book sellers in the cities he frequented as he traveled with the Yankees and other teams. His collection included an imprint of Aristotle's Art of Rhetoric, published by Gunther Zainer in 1476. Death Dan Daniel died in Pompano Beach, Florida, at the age of 91.

The film also stars Demi Moore, along with Tom Skerritt and Veronica Cartwright as Estevez's parents. The ending credits song is \\"Home Again\\" by Oingo Boingo and the score by Danny Elfman. The film is dedicated to the memory of Henry Proach, who was a good friend of Estevez, and who appears briefly in the picture. Plot John Wisdom is a young man just out of college. On the night of his high school graduation, he got drunk and stole a car. With a grand theft auto conviction he is branded a felon and as a result can not hold down a decent job. Seeing no future for himself, Wisdom takes a left turn: he decides to become a criminal \\"for the people\\", evocative of Robin Hood. After seeing news reports about impoverished farmers and working class people being sent to the bank to pay ownership debts, Wisdom goes on a bank robbing spree with his girlfriend, Karen Simmons; they erase loan and mortgage records, buying time for the poor to pay their debts. With the FBI after them, things take a turn for the worse when a panicky Karen kills a local sheriff. She and Wisdom make a run for the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, but when Karen is shot by a police helicopter, Wisdom leaves her in the care of some high school students and their teacher. He resumes his flight but is surrounded by police and federal agents at a college football field. As Wisdom appears to be reaching for his gun, he is riddled with gunfire and dies. John wakes up where the film started, in his parents' bathroom. He emerges from the bathtub and proceeds to get ready for his job interview. His entire story has apparently been a daydream. Cast Emilio Estevez as John Wisdom * Demi Moore as Karen Simmons * Tom Skerritt as Lloyd Wisdom * Veronica Cartwright as Samantha Wisdom * William Allen Young as Agent Williamson * Richard Minchenberg as Agent Cooper * Ernie Brown as Bill, Motel manager * Charlie Sheen as City Burger manager * Brenda Medcalf as Girl on bike Production Estevez says the idea for the film \\"started as just the title. I thought it would be great visually. Just 'Wisdom' across the screen.\\" He wrote the first draft in three weeks. Wisdom became the surname of the lead character. Estevez says Wisdom is \\"without a place in society... He becomes a criminal because he feels it's the only thing society has left him to do.\\" Estevez added at the film was basically \\"about two people ‚Äì their relationship and their discoveries. Those discoveries leave Wisdom not only wanted dead or alive in five states, but also a modern-day folk hero.\\" In October 1985 David Begelman's Gladden Entertainment announced it had signed a deal with the 23 year old Estevez to write, produce and direct Wisdom. Estevez had previously written That Was Then This is Now. Begelman had been in charge of Columbia, and MGM, during which time he gave Walter Hill, Barry Levinson and Richard Benjamin their first directing jobs. Comparisons were made with Orson Welles who was 24 when he wrote, produced and directed Citizen Kane. Estevez said \\"if they promote Wisdom as this most phenomenal thing that hasn't happened since Orson Welles, I'm going to get hit.\\" \\"I have a kind of nihilistic point of view\\", he added. \\"I'm into making films that are realistic and not fluff. When you deal in reality, you're dealing with a lot of serious problems. We could be sitting here and now and being vaporized by nuclear weapons by accidentally. That's reality... Life does not end happily ever after.\\" The female lead went to Demi Moore who was then Estevez's fianc√©e. (The two met while making St Elmo's Fire.) \\"I'm not going to sit here and say it was the most positive professional move for me when I made that picture\\", she said later. \\"Of course, doing it was based on my feelings for him and my desire to share it with him. It was very special. I was around from the day Emilio wrote the first page. I would read every page, and we would talk. The attachment to the project was real.\\" The Gladden Entertainment Company suggested Robert Wise be hired to work as \\"executive director\\" (mentor) and Estevez agreed. Wise said, \\"I was there to be an aid to him if he wanted to discuss something or whether he felt this kind of angle or editing standpoint was a good one, whether the different angles in a scene were enough coverage. I didn't ever step in when he was staging a scene. Then if I saw something that bothered me, I would get him aside and say, 'Be careful of this or watch for that. Be careful, I think you have her looking the wrong way in this shot.' Mainly technical things. We would discuss the pacing of scenes. And that would be primarily it.\\" The film was finished $200,000 under budget and a day ahead of schedule. It was one of the first film scores from Danny Elfman. \\"In a way, it's a very subversive film\\", Estevez said. \\"A lot of people are angered by the message it gives the kids: If you want something changed, then pick up a gun and change it. But if they stay until the end, they'll realize that violence doesn't solve anything. I'm going to take a beating on this one. \\"I can see myself getting my feet wet as a director, and there's a choppiness, an awkwardness to it. It's not totally relaxed. I made the movie first for myself, and I think just getting it done is an accomplishment. I fought my battle in just getting it done, and being the youngest person to get it done. Not that I set out to break any kind of record or anything, or to prove to anybody that I could do it.\\" Reception The film received negative reviews from critics: Leonard Maltin considered it \\"wretchedly scripted, with one of the most self-defeating wrap-ups you'll ever see.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Estevez later said the film \\"was a very disappointing experience ‚Äì the outcome of it. I shouldn't say disappointing. I should say devastating ‚Äì the response, how it was received. I tell you what: It was not a great film, but it was a good film. And I believe that now... I think if I show an area of weakness, it's in the writing and in the structure of my writing. I think I need to get an objective point of view.\\" \\" Moore and Estevez broke up not long after the film's release. She later recalled \\"there was a strong lash-out against Emilio. I can't get in the skins of those people who wrote what they wrote... I thought he did a great job and that his directing was very strong for someone who had never done this before.\\" \\"I took a beating from critics and I took it personally\\", said Estevez later. \\"I was broken for a period of time. But I've learned you really can't take it personally. . . . Making a film at that age was winning the battle. Having it released was icing on the cake.\\" Estevez added \\"I learned that you don't go into a project with a script that's not ready. You've got to have all the bugs worked out before you start... I also learned how to be more economical with my shots and with my time... [I was] like a kid in a candy store. When you're 23 and somebody hands you $4.5 million and tells you to go out and make a film, there will be some excesses.\\" Home media In 2009, Warner Bros. released Wisdom on DVD through its \\"Warner Archive\\" burn-on-demand service.

An automaton clock or automata clock is a type of striking clock featuring automatons. Clocks like these were built from the 1st century BC through to Victorian times in Europe. A Cuckoo clock is a simple form of this type of clock.

Common figures in older clocks include Death (as a reference to human mortality), Old Father Time, saints and angels. In the Regency and Victorian eras, common figures also included royalty, famous composers or industrialists. More recently constructed automaton clocks are widespread in Japan, where they are known as karakuri-dokei.

They were invented in Georgia, United States, in 1965. In most cases, a dye pack is placed in a hollowed-out space within a stack of banknotes, usually $10 or $20 bills. This stack of bills looks and feels identical to a real one, but usually subtly marked in a way that is only privy to selected bank employees. The development of flexible dye packs makes it virtually impossible to detect by persons handling the stack. When the marked stack of bills is not used, it is stored next to a magnetic plate near a bank cashier, in standby or safe mode, ready to be handed over to a bank robber by a bank employee. When it is removed from the magnetic plate, the pack is armed. Once it leaves the building and passes through the door frame, a radio transmitter located at the door triggers a timer (typically at least 10 seconds), after which the dye pack explosively releases an aerosol (usually of Disperse Red 9) and sometimes tear gas, intended to destroy the stolen money and mark the robber's body with a bright stain. The chemical reaction causing the explosion of the pack and the release of the dye creates high temperatures of about which further discourages a criminal from touching the pack or removing it from the bag or getaway vehicle. Dye packs are used to foil robberies in over 75% of banks in the U.S. In England, a robber who fled a bank in Regent Street laughing \\"Haha, I've got all the money\\", was enveloped in \\"a red cloud\\" of dye as he ran away down Shaftesbury Avenue.

The 30,000 soldiers were likely the only combat- ready reserve forces in Germany at the time.Ryan, Cornelius A Bridge Too Far. 1974. p. 49 However, few of the Army's units or personnel were paratroopers. Student was transferred to the Eastern Front, and on 18 November 1944, command of the First Parachute Army passed to General der Fallschirmtruppe Alfred Schlemm, who opposed the Canadian First Army during the Battle of the Reichswald. The Canadian First Army and Lieutenant-General William Hood Simpson‚Äôs U.S. Ninth Army compressed Schlemm‚Äôs forces into a small bridgehead on the west bank of the Rhine opposite Wesel.

Bergl (1901-September 1950) was a mechanic who supplied specially designed vehicles for Chicago's underworld, including Al Capone's Chicago Outfit, Depression-era outlaw George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, and members of the Barker Gang. Operating from his garage, Bergl Auto Sales, on 22nd Street, next to Ralph \\"Bottles\\" Capone's Cotton Club, Bergl supplied Capone's organization with custom-made cars for both protection and evasion purposes. This included armor-plated vehicles with bulletproof windows, the ability to create oil slicks and smokescreens, and other devices designed to elude police pursuit. Members of the Barker Gang used such a car when they robbed Federal Reserve Bank messengers at Jackson Boulevard on September 22, 1933. After a patrolman was killed, the gang fled the scene with a load of canceled checks and eventually were forced to abandon their car after crashing it. Upon finding the wrecked car, police traced the vehicle to Bergl's shop and arrested Gus Winkler, a member of the Chicago Outfit and Bergl's silent partner, naming the Chicago gangster as a member of a national armed robbery syndicate which supposedly included Depression-era bandits George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly and Vernon Miller. Winkler was killed in a gangland slaying by unidentified gunmen on October 9, who reportedly suspected he would turn state's evidence in exchange for a reduction of the long prison sentence he was facing.

The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and scholiasts, both ancient and recent, including Aelius Herodianus, Georgius Choeroboscus, Saint Methodius, Orion of Thebes, Oros of Alexandria and Theognostus the Grammarian.Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989) The Etymologicum Genuinum was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around Photius. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the Etymologicum Magnum, Etymologicum Gudianum and Etymologicum Symeonis.Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206 Modern scholarship discovered the Etymologicum Genuinum only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century manuscripts, Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1818 (= A) and Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest recension nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºòœÑœÖŒºŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ and later œÑ·Ω∏ ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ± ·ºòœÑœÖŒºŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by Richard Reitzenstein, who was the first to edit a sample section.Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44 The Etymologicum Genuinum remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972) Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by Ada Adler and continued by Klaus Alpers,Alpers (1969) the other by Fran√ßois Lasserre and Nikolaos Livadaras.Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- ) The latter edition is published under the title Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum, but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the Etymologicum Magnum.E.

The film is a pastiche using film clips from Republic serials, re-dubbed with comic dialog to tell a tale of world conquest by sex, drugs and rock and roll. In the film, the Lightning Bug, embodied by garish villains from several serials, attempts to take over the world with rock and roll. He later adds sex and drugs when music alone doesn't work. He explains his changing appearance by saying, \\"I'm bringing all five of my costumes!\\" The Lightning Bug is voiced by legendary radio DJ M.G. Kelly (also called \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly). Peter Bergman plays The Chief and Philip Proctor plays Agent Barton. They appear in period-style black and white sequences that are used to frame the re-dubbed clips of car chases, explosions, flying men, sinister villains and villainesses, fights, and various other perils that are strung together in a somewhat incoherent plot. Plot The Bug's first victims are square record moguls Lawrence Milk and Jive Davis, who are hypnotized or otherwise prodded into killing themselves, and bandleader 'Scream' Dorsey, whose car is booby trapped and then run off a cliff. The Bug, his henchmen and henchwomen (including the villainess Sombra) are opposed by the J-Men, a group of government agents hired by the legendary J. Eager Believer. Besides the Chief and his bumbling sidekick, Agent Barton, the J-Men include Agents Spike, Claire and Lance, Buzz Cufflink, Yank Smellfinger, James Armhole, Rocket Jock (clips of Commando Cody from Radar Men from the Moon), the Lone Star (clips from Captain America), the Caped Madman (clips of Captain Marvel from Adventures of Captain Marvel; who transforms by using the phrase \\"Sh-Boom\\"), Spy Swatter (clips from Spy Smasher), Sleeve Coat, Juicy Withers, and Admiral Balzy. Many of them appear to die horrible, inescapable deaths in the course of the film. The J-Men work in cooperation with the F.C.C. (Federal Culture Control), opposing the Lightning Bug with Muzac (created by M.U.S.A.C., the Military Underground Sugared Airwaves Command), then with a bomb to blow up the Lightning Bug's base on the Moon. However, the Lightning Bug beats them to it, by turning his stereo up too loud and blowing up the Moon himself (and all of New York City in the process, which the J-Men consider a \\"double victory\\"). At the end of the film, Agent Barton mournfully recites the list of J-Men who supposedly gave their lives in the epic struggle against the Bug. The Chief laughs, then starts choking on a cigar he is smoking. After he stops choking, The Chief points out that J-Men are flexible enough to survive any life-threatening situation, and the final clips (from the following week's edition of the serial) show exactly how each J-Man escaped their particular peril. Soundtrack The movie soundtrack features music from Budgie's 1978 Impeckable album, The Tubes, Head East and Billy Preston.

Like most Piper products at this time, the PA-40 was named after a Native American tribe, in this case the Arapaho. Development The Arapaho was similar in size to the Twin Comanche and had six seats but had a taller main landing gear and larger cabin windows. It had two counter-rotating 160 hp Lycoming IO-320 engines. The prototype was damaged in June 1972 when the factory at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, flooded and the prototype, registered N9999P, did not fly until 16 January 1973. It crashed on 21 September 1973 during spin trials. and the aircraft was redesigned with a taller tailfin. The second modified prototype with normally aspirated engines first flew in April 1974 and was followed by a third aircraft with turbocharged engines. The PA-40 was type certified on 18 July 1974, as an amendment to the Twin Comanche type certificate. The Arapaho was scheduled to be launched as a 1975 model, but the company decided not to market the aircraft and the project was cancelled in December 1974. Piper stated that the cancellation was for financial reasons as it did not want to establish a new production line during the 1973‚Äì1975 recession. Following cancellation the two aircraft were used by Piper as company liaison and communication aircraft, one based at Lock Haven, the other at Lakeland, Florida. Later, one aircraft was scrapped by Piper and the third, registered N9997P, is now privately owned in Texas, following use by the Purdue University student maintenance program.

In addition, it oversees more than 150,000 amateur teams nationwide. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. History USA Softball was founded in 1933 as the Amateur Softball Association (ASA) with a tournament held in Chicago that was organized by Leo Fischer and Michael J. Pauley. The following year, the 1934 National Recreation Congress recognized the ASA. Shortly afterward, the ASA was located in Newark, New Jersey. A world amateur softball tournament was held by the ASA at Chicago's Soldier Field that started on September 7, 1939. The ASA relocated to its new headquarters in Oklahoma City on January 1, 1966. On June 30, 2016, the Amateur Softball Association of ASA/USA Softball announced that it would be changing its organizational and trade name to \\"USA Softball,\\" effective on January 1, 2017, along with a new logo. Since 2005, the organization has run the World Cup of Softball. The USA Softball Hall of Fame Complex also hosts the NCAA Women's College World Series and the Big 12 Conference softball championship. Team USA In 1978, the United States Olympic Committee named USA Softball the national governing body of softball in the United States. Due to this designation, USA Softball is responsible for training, equipping, and promoting the six USA softball national teams that compete in events such as the Olympics, Pan American Games, World Championships and other international and domestic events. In 1996, the USA softball women's national team became the first American softball team to compete in the Olympics. Amateur programs The USA softball youth program began in 1974. Over 80,000 teams, 1.3 million players, and 300,000 coaches participate in USA Softball's youth division on an annual basis. The USA Softball adult program began in 1934. With over 170,000 teams, 2.5 million players, and 500,000 coaches involved on an annual basis, the adult program is the largest USA Softball program. USA Softball provides programs of competition for adults including fast pitch, slow pitch and modified pitch for men and women. National Softball Hall of Fame and museum The National Softball Hall of Fame was dedicated May 26, 1973, in Oklahoma City. It has 337 members with 125 deceased, including players, managers, umpires, and other suitable individuals. Rule book USA Softball publishes an updated rule book for softball each year which is widely used by adult and youth recreational leagues in the United States and abroad. The USA Softball rules were also used for the softball competition when it was an Olympic sport between 1996 and 2008.

It is also a subgenre of the larger genre of serious games, along with other subgenres such as newsgames and educational games. An individual game may also be referred to as a \\"game for change\\" if it is produced by this community or shares its ideals. \\"Games for Change\\" is also the name for the non-profit organization founded in 2004 which is building the field by providing support, visibility, and shared resources to individuals and organizations using digital games for social change. The organization curates a continuously growing body of \\"digital and non-digital games that engage contemporary social issues in a meaningful way\\".  Examples  The game Sweatshop is an example of a past digital game curated by the Games for Change organization. Launched in 2011 by Littleloud, it is strategy game about offshore clothing manufacturing. The player plays the role of a factory manager responsible for hiring workers, completing store orders, and meeting the demands of clients while trying to balance ethical decisions with rising demands. The game has 30 levels that increase in difficulty and complexity, and introduce new worker types and real-world sweatshop problems such as fires, unions and the lack of toilets that add authenticity to the game mechanics. The game utilizes the mechanics of tower defense, which have been used in many entertainment games such as Plants vs. Zombies. In Sweatshop, the clothing materials on the conveyor belt can be likened to ‚Äúenemies‚Äù, and the factory workers who turn the materials into finished product can be seen as the defending ‚Äútroops‚Äù. The use of tower defense mechanics allows the player to strategize how they will meet client demands in each level. The player must choose either to keep the workers safe and satisfied or sacrifice their well-being for factory efficiency, and because of these difficult decisions the game has been known for its ability to evoke guilt in players. Many players have reported their struggle to keep workers safe when trying to win more difficult levels. Littleloud worked with the British charity Labour Behind The Label to ensure the game was factually accurate, but due to controversy over its factual approach the game was eventually removed from the Apple App store.

It is specifically designed to avoid a backup collision. The area directly behind vehicles has been described as a \\"killing zone\\" due to associated accidents. Backup cameras are usually connected to the vehicle head unit display. Function The design of a backup camera is distinct from other cameras in that the image is horizontally flipped so that the output is a mirror image. This is necessary because the camera and the driver face opposite directions, and without it, the camera's right would be on the driver's left and vice versa. A mirrored image makes the orientation of the display consistent with the physical mirrors installed on the vehicle. A backup camera typically sports a wide-angle or fisheye lens. While such a lens spoils the camera's ability to see faraway objects, it allows the camera to see an uninterrupted horizontal path from one rear corner to the other. The camera is typically pointed on a downward angle, to view potential obstacles on the ground as well as the position of approaching walls and docks, rather than straight back. Backup cameras are common on vehicles that tow difficult-to-see trailers, such as motorhomes. Recently, with the rise in popularity of in-dash DVD players and GPS navigation systems which aid in justifying the expense of adding a color LCD to the driver's seat, they have become much more common, often available as optional factory accessories on standard passenger trucks and sport utility vehicles, as well as aftermarket accessories. Inside the vehicle, the display is typically wired to automatically sense when the transmission is set in reverse, showing the backup view while in reverse and or providing grid guidelines by detecting the parking lot markings to aid the driver. The display will show the map (or other content) on the screen at all other times typically in other gear modes in most parking systems. Variations Backup cameras are produced in different varieties depending on the application. * Backup or Reversing Cameras can be added as aftermarket additions to vehicles that do not come with factory-fitted systems. They are available in both wired and wireless versions. * For large vehicles such as motorhomes, camera systems with built- in servomechanisms allow the driver to remotely pan and tilt the camera. *Wireless Backup Cameras come with a wireless camera and receiver, which make it easier and cheaper to install them. * Built-in audio intercoms (one-way or two-way) are used in addition to the camera system for communicating with a spotter outside the vehicle - common when backing large trailers or launching boats. * Night vision cameras use a series of infrared lights for backing in the dark, when the positioning or the intensity of the vehicle's white reverse lights are insufficient for this purpose. * Portable or semi-permanent all-in- one camera systems (also known as dashboard cameras or dashcams) are sold typically for vehicles that don't have displays permanently installed in the dash. Such systems consist of a small portable screen that can be affixed on the dashboard or on rearview mirror, and a length of wire to reach the cameras, including a backup camera. * So, some backup and rear cameras are connected to displays on the rearview mirror and are used in vehicles to detect activity behind the car to \\"avoid the tooling, software, hardware, and testing costs associated with integrating the display/feature in other areas of the vehicle.\\" * License-plate-frame versions permit permanent installation without any permanent vehicle modifications. * Custom cameras: brake light cameras are combination devices that contain a camera, while still illuminating as a brake light. Some backup cameras also use a combination of LEDs surrounding the camera lens to illuminate the surroundings while in use. Introduction The first backup camera was used in the 1956 Buick Centurion concept car, presented in January 1956 at the General Motors Motorama. The vehicle had a rear-mounted television camera that sent images to a TV screen in the dashboard in place of the rear-view mirror. Later the 1972 Volvo Experimental Safety Car (VESC) had a backup camera. However, the camera element did not make it into the following Volvo 240 model. The first production automobile to incorporate a backup camera was the 1991 Toyota Soarer Limited (UZZ31 and UZZ32), which was only available in Japan and not on its U.S. counterpart, the Lexus SC. The Toyota system used a color EMV screen, with a rear-spoiler-mounted CCD camera. The system was discontinued in 1997. In April 2000, Nissan's Infiniti luxury division introduced the RearView Monitor on the 2002 Q45 flagship sedan at the 2000 New York International Auto Show. Introducing coloured onscreen guide lines as a parking distance parameter, the RearView Monitor operated from a license-plate-mounted camera in the trunk that transmitted a mirrored image to an in-dash (7-inch) LCD screen. It was available as optional equipment upon North American market launch in March 2001. The 2002 Nissan Primera introduced the RearView Monitor backup camera system to territories outside Japan and North America. Aftermarket options for cars have been available for some time. Electronics manufacturers have made multiple car upgrades available that can be installed by professionals without replacing the car's center console. Others Other types of camera systems can give a more comprehensive view. =Around View Monitor= Around View Monitor on a Nissan Elgrand In 2007 Nissan introduced their \\"Around View Monitor\\" on the 2008 Infiniti EX35, which uses four cameras to give a bird's eye view of the vehicle. BMW introduced their competing system called Surround View in 2009 on the F10 5 Series. Other automobile manufacturers have since offered similar systems and 2011 Toyota Introduced Panoramic View Monitor in a 2012 facelift Alphard and Vellfire. =Side mirror= First offered in October 2018, the Japanese market Lexus ES can be optioned with cameras as side view mirrors.https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/lexus-es-digital-outer-mirrors- camera-sideview-world-first-controversy-audi/ Wireless Backup Camera This is an advanced type of reversing camera that does not require the use of cables between the camera itself and the display. It functions remotely. Wireless rear-view cameras usually have separate sources of power from the display. The cameras are usually powered by the same power source as the brake and thus switches on automatically when one engages the reverse gear. Majority of these backup cameras usually come with a transmitter (near the camera) and a receiver (near the display) for relaying the signals and live images. Some models such as the Pearl RearVision backup camera, which is made by Pearl Automation, use solar energy for power. The display for these types of backup camera can be powered from the cigarette socket on the car's dashboard. Some of the displays are also integrated on the rear-view mirror thereby giving it a multipurpose function. Some models also sync directly with one's phone using an app which then acts as the display. The main advantage of this type of backup camera is that it is extremely easy to install and rarely requires the help of professional when doing it. The installation of these cameras also do not interfere with a car's look as minimal to no drilling or laying of wires is required. However, this comes at a cost as some of these wireless cameras are quite expensive. Blind spot monitors and other technology Blind spot monitors are an option that may include more than monitoring the sides of the vehicle. It can include \\"Cross Traffic Alert\\", \\"which alerts drivers backing out of a parking space when traffic is approaching from the sides.\\"Automobile Blind-Spot Monitoring System, Tri-City Insurance News, January 27, 2006 Mandates In the United States, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007 required the United States Department of Transportation to issue backup-collision-safety regulations within three years and require full compliance within four years after final rulemaking. The law specified a statutory deadline of February 2011 for issuing the final regulations. However, under the Obama administration the USDOT repeatedly granted itself extensions to the deadline, claiming it needed more time analyze the costs and benefits of the requirement. In September 2013, Greg Gulbransen, the father of the child whom the law was named after, along with a group of consumers and advocates submitted a petition to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, demanding that the USDOT implement regulations on backup cameras within 90 days. About half of model year 2012 automobiles were equipped with backup cameras. On March 31, 2014, four years past its deadline, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it would require all automobiles sold in the United States built beginning in May 2018 to include backup cameras. On October 31, 2016, Transport Canada issued a similar mandate beginning at the same time.

Biography Born in Gu√©ret, Creuse, France, Marcel Jouhandeau grew up in a world of women presided over by his grandmother. Under the influence of a young woman from the Carmel of Limoges, he embraced a spiritual form of Catholicism and considered entering the orders for a time. However, in 1908 he left for Paris where he studied first at the Lyc√©e Henri-IV, and then at the Sorbonne, where he began to write. In 1912 he became a professor at a school at Passy. In his youth, Marcel Jouhandeau began experiencing homosexual urges. Although he felt guilty and believed he was offending God, his feelings of shame did not prevent him from engaging in numerous homosexual acts. Throughout his life, Jouhandeau alternated between celebrating the male body and feeling mortified in regards to his sexuality. In 1914, during a spiritual crisis, he burned his manuscripts and attempted suicide. Once the crisis had passed, he turned again to writing. He created Pincegrain, the village chronicles that brought him his first literary success. During World War I, he was a secretary in his hometown of Gu√©ret. In 1924, he published Pincegrain, a chronicle of the inhabitants of Gu√©ret, which shocked the people of the town. His voyages became an opportunity to indulge in homosexuality, as he recounted in the Amateur d'imprudences. At age 40, he married a dancer, √âlisabeth (Elise) Toulemont, known as Caryathis, the former mistress of Charles Dullin and an intimate friend of Jean Cocteau and Max Jacob. She hoped to rid him of his homosexual leanings. During this period he undertook a work of Christian moralism (De l'abjection) before, much to the dismay of his wife, tumbling again into the arms of men, which he wrote about in Chronique d'une passion and Eloge de la volupt√©. Nevertheless, Jouhandeau and his wife adopted a girl named C√©line, who gave birth to Jouhandeau's grandson, Marc. Following √âlise's death in 1971, Jouhandeau lived his last days in Rueil-Malmaison with Marc. In 1938, Jouhandeau published four anti-Semitic articles in a short volume, \\"Le P√©ril Juif\\" (The Jewish Peril). During the Nazi occupation of France, he accepted Goebbels' invitation to visit Germany.Reports quoted by L√©on Werth, D√©position, Paris,1992, p. 462.David M.

The Court upheld the law. Background In 1994, Andrew Darrach, an Ottawa resident, was charged with sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend. At trial, he attempted to introduce evidence of his ex-girlfriend's sexual history. A voir dire, required under the rape shield law in section 276 of the Criminal Code to consider whether the evidence is admissible, was carried out. The judge refused to admit the evidence after Darrach refused to be cross- examined on his affidavit. Darrach was sentenced to nine months in jail. An initial appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.R. v. Darrach (1998 CanLII 1648 (ON CA)) The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court. Darrach argued he was denied a fair trial because he was unable to present evidence that he mistakenly believed that the ex-girlfriend had consented. He also argued that his right to silence and right against self-incrimination were violated by the requirement to testify at the voir dire.R. v. Darrach ([2000] 2 S.C.R. 443) Opinion of the Court Gonthier J, writing for a unanimous Court, upheld the Criminal Code provisions. He found that requiring the complainant to testify would be unnecessarily invasive and would discourage victims from reporting such incidents. Gonthier also found that Darrach's right to avoid self-incrimination was not infringed by the requirement for him to testify regarding his voir dire affidavit, because the accused made the voluntary decision to have the voir dire carried out. The decision to have the voir dire, and by extension the requirement to submit an affidavit and accept cross-examination, was voluntarily made by Darrach. Any testimony at the voir dire would have solely been to determine the admissibility of the evidence Darrach wished to submit, and would have been unusable in the trial itself.

The event kept the name acronym IPSN from 2003 onwards but the full name changed from International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (2003 - 2004) to International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (2005 - 2007). It is expected that IPSN would keep the full name International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks for the coming years. SPOTS Track In 2005 IPSN introduced a separate track on Sensor Platforms, Tools and Design Methods (SPOTS) to the conference. The focus of the IPSN track is more on information processing algorithms, and the focus of SPOTS track is on platform tools and design methods for network embedded sensors.

He served as the Member of Parliament for Galloway from October 1974‚Äì79. Early life Thompson was born on 11 September 1928 in The Glenkens, Galloway, Scotland. In the 1950s he went to Rome and studied at the Pontifical Scots College. After the death of his father, he returned to Scotland without completing his studies, then spent seven years working for the Forestry Commission. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh and took up a position at Kirkcudbright Academy where he taught French and German. Political career Thompson stood as the SNP candidate for the Galloway constituency in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election but was unsuccessful. Another election was called later that year in October 1974, this time he gained the Galloway seat from the Conservatives with a majority of 30 votes (0.1%). Following the election he was announced as the SNP's spokesperson on health. He stood again in 1979 but lost the seat to the Conservative Ian Lang. Priest In September 1989 he was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in St Teresa's, Dumfries, in 1989. He served as assistant in St Teresa's, Dumfries, as Parish Priest in St Margaret of Scotland in Irvine, and as parish priest in St Peter's, Dalbeattie in 1993. He retired in 2005. He died aged 88 years, on 23 December 2016, at Senwick Nursing Home in Borgue, Dumfries and Galloway.

The strings form a woven network inside the head (or \\"hoop\\") of the racquet. Strings have been made with a variety of materials and possess varying properties that have been measured, such as dynamic stiffness, tension retention, thickness (gauge), string texture (shape of the string), and rebound efficiency. Composition The material used in tennis string can significantly affect a player's performance, and even health. Several materials are used to make tennis strings. They vary in terms of elasticity, durability, rebound efficiency, tension holding capability, and manufacturing cost, among other considerations. =Natural gut= Animal intestine is the most resilient material used to make tennis strings. It has better tension retention than any other material, and also is softer than any other material used for tennis strings. It provides the most energy return, meaning it is the most efficient string. It remains soft at high tensions while other materials tend to stiffen dramatically. This allows gut string to enable players to string rather tightly to improve ball control without losing much rebound efficiency (power) and without greatly increasing impact shock, which can hurt the elbow and other joints. Its principal drawbacks are much higher cost to manufacture and purchase than other materials, weakness to shear stresses from off-center hits (typical of beginning players), variable quality control depending upon the brand, batch, age, storage conditions, and grade, difficulty of stringing due to its delicacy, and poor durability when wetted with water. Natural gut is very sensitive to different types of weather and those players who use it normally carry several different racquets with different tensions to compensate for this. Some players, particularly those who hit flat shots and hit the sweet spot consistently, find high-quality gut to be more durable than many other types of strings due to its outstanding tension retention. This may help to offset the high initial cost. The use of a dense string pattern also generally improves the longevity of natural gut. Natural gut is produced by drying fibers extracted from a part of the cow intestine called the serous membrane, or serosa, which contains collagen designed to withstand the stretching and contraction of the intestine. It is this elasticity that makes the fibers useful for tennis string. Sheep intestines have also been used for racquet strings in the past. A general name for this material is catgut. The first natural gut tennis string was rumored to be manufactured in 1875 by Pierre Babolat, who would launch the VS brand of gut fifty years later. Natural gut is usually offered in coated form, to reduce its tendency to unravel, particularly when humid or wet. =Synthetic gut= Synthetic gut is nylon, nearly always composed of a single filament. It is a very inexpensive string to manufacture and is generally the least expensive string to purchase. Small changes from pure nylon are usually found in strings sold as \\"synthetic gut\\". Textured coatings, colorants and the addition of a small amount of Kevlar are the most common changes. Some manufacturers, such as Gosen, label nylon strings with words like \\"sheep\\", as in sheep intestine, although such strings contain no gut. Synthetic gut, as it is used for mono-filament nylon strings, is now a misnomer, as the creation of multi-filament strings has provided players with a better approximation of natural gut's performance. Modern \\"synthetic gut\\" is actually a multi-filament string that holds its tension extremely well and which has a dynamic stiffness profile that is closest to natural gut, although the industry continues to apply the term to mono-filament nylon strings. = Multi-filament, or \\"multi\\" = SEM micrograph of a sectioned Multi-filament string Multi-filament strings, known commonly as \\"multis\\" are strings that have more than one filament. They are most commonly made of many filaments of nylon, but can incorporate other materials such as polyurethane, Zyex, Vectran, Kevlar, and other materials. Multi- filament strings offer better elasticity than single filament strings, but usually inferior durability. No multi-filament string holds its tension as well as natural gut, and none of them is as soft. However, in comparison to mono-filament \\"synthetic gut\\", multi-filament strings can offer a much closer approximation of natural gut's performance. The softest multi-filament strings can be made with Zyex and polyolefin, although some of the softest of these strings are no longer on the market. =Nylon= Nylon is the most popular string material for amateur players due to its low cost and the improvement in elasticity offered by multi-filament strings. Wear-resistant coatings for nylon strings are common, especially with multi-filament strings, because the outer filaments tend to break first as the racquet is used.> =Polyester= Polyester is a stiff and durable string material, originally intended for use by frequent string breakers. It took time for this string material to become popular, primarily due to its poor tension holding capability. However, players feel they are able to apply more topspin to balls while maintaining control with polyester strings. Polyester's support for heavy topspin in particular has made it the most popular material in the pro tour. The increased topspin due to polyester strings has been verified with controlled experiments today. The exact cause for the increased spin is not known but there is strong evidence that the low friction between strings is a factor. =Kevlar= Kevlar is the stiffest, most durable synthetic string available, and is thus extremely hard to break. Although it is one of the best strings in terms of tension holding capability (next to natural gut), it is the most dangerous string when it comes to developing tennis elbow. Kevlar is often strung with another string, such as nylon), in order to combine both strings' qualities, as Kevlar by itself feels too stiff for many tennis players, especially when combined with a stiff racquet. Some advocate using a very thin gauge Kevlar for increasing comfort, but even in the thinnest gauge it is a stiff string. Another strategy to increase comfort and improve rebound efficiency is to string Kevlar at a low tension. =Vectran= Vectran is the second-most stiff and durable of string types. It is perhaps the least commonly used contemporary string material. It is usually added to nylon string to increase nylon's durability and stiffness, as with Kevlar. Yonex, for instance, offers two badminton strings, made primarily from nylon, which have Vectran strands. However, the Ashaway company offers a braided Vectran tennis string. =Zyex= Zyex string offers more rebound efficiency, i.e. gut-like dynamic stiffness, than other synthetic strings, particularly when strung at low tensions. This gives it playability that is more similar to natural gut than, arguably, other synthetic materials. It also has low overall stiffness. The ProKennex IQ Element Z string, for instance, has the lowest stiffness of any synthetic string yet tested. The drawback of Zyex is that the outer wrapping materials in Zyex tennis string tend to be much less durable than the Zyex filaments inside the string and do not bond with them. This can lead to the outer wrapping wearing away, leaving the inner Zyex filaments. =Polyolefin= Polyolefin is one of the softest synthetic string materials, rivaling some Zyex and most nylon multi-filaments. It offers mediocre durability and tension retention, so it is generally used as the cross string in a hybrid string setup. For those who do not break strings very quickly, however, 100% polyolefin stringing may be a good alternative to natural gut and multi-filament strings. This is especially true for those who have had tennis elbow and find natural gut string to be too costly. =Metal wire= Metal wire, usually piano wire, was used in some historical racquets.Tennis and the Revenge of Technological Revolution by Edward TennerMetal racquets by Rod =Titanium= Titanium is also used. Gauge The \\"gauge\\" number determines the thickness of the string. A string rated with a high gauge number is a thinner string, and vice versa. Thinner strings typically offer higher performance but break more frequently than thicker strings. Stringing pattern A strung tennis racquet Virtually all modern racquets are strung in a criss-cross horizontal-vertical pattern. Various other patterns have been used in history with varying success. Double strung tennis racquets were introduced in 1977 but the \\"spaghetti racquets\\" were later banned because they permitted excessive spin and were too successful. However, a modern version of the double strung racquet has been introduced that is legal to use. Racquets are strung either with two separate strings (and thus four knots), or with a single string (resulting in only two knots). Sometimes, a hybrid of two different string types may be used in the same racquet. Traditionally, a double half hitch has been used to tie off tennis string, along with a starting knot. Recently, new kinds of knots have been used called the \\"pro- knot\\" and \\"Parnell knot\\". Along with the use of a starting clamp, this can make all the knots identical, and improve the aesthetics of a string job. Stringing The process of installing strings in the racquet is called \\"stringing,\\" and is done with a racquet string machine. These machines vary in complexity, accuracy and price. String tension The \\"string tension\\" of a racquet, usually expressed in pounds, indicates the pressure under which the strings are secured to the frame. The string tension affects a racquet's playing characteristics, such as the \\"feel\\" of the ball, control over the ball, as well as maximizing power. All racquets come with recommended string tensions, most of which lie between 50 and 70 pounds (220 to 310 N). A loosely strung racquet will usually have a larger sweet spot and will hit farther but, when swung hard enough, it will shoot balls unpredictably; a tighter string job will help make delicate shots with more finesse and control. An extremely tightly strung racquet cuts down on a tennis player's feel on the ball, but can give the player excellent control if swung hard enough, with a smooth stroke. Such tension may make delicate shots more difficult, but makes play from the baseline more constant. However, if a player often hits powerful shots, a tightly strung racquet may quickly tire the arm, possibly resulting in tennis elbow. Many professional stringers advise players to string racquets with the lowest tension possible while still being able to maintain control of the ball. Beginning players trying to find their tension should start in the middle of the recommended tension range and adjust the tension from there to meet their needs. The recommended tension is usually printed on the racquet. With a lower tension the racquet will have more power and less control; with a higher tension, it will have less power and more control. Restringing Due to the tension present on the strings, elasticity and tension begins to decrease the moment they are installed in a racquet. \\"Dead strings\\", or strings which have lost their tension, cut down on the performance of a racquet. Dead strings may also hamper a tennis player's ability to generate power and pace, and may even make their arm sore. The frequency of restringing depends on the player and the racquet, but there are a few recommended intervals.McEnroe, Patrick; and Bodo, Peter. Tennis for dummies. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, 1998. One is to restring the racquet as many times in a year as the player uses it in a week; e.g., if the racquet is used three times per week, it should be restrung three times per year. Another guideline is to restring after every 40 hours of play; if the racquet is used three times per week and three hours per session, it should be restrung approximately every five weeks. If the player has access to a tennis string tension meter (or access to a pro shop equipped with one), he may restring his racquet after he measures a loss of 25% or more of stringbed stiffness. However, many players who hit the ball hard enough to break the strings simply restring rackets whenever the strings break. United States Racquet Stringers Association The United States Racquet Stringers Association (USRSA) offers two levels of certification for stringers: the Certified Stringer and the Master Racquet Technician, of which around 350 exist worldwide. The Master Racquet Technician certification process includes testing of the stringer's ability to string a racquet, perform grip work, identify mistakes in an improperly strung racquet, and pass a written test that covers not only strings, but racquet technology as well. Since 2004, RSi, the USRSA's monthly magazine, has named a Stringer of the Year.

He began his NFL officiating career as a back judge and became a referee eight years later. During his career, he officiated in two Super Bowls, Super Bowl XVII in 1983 as a back judge and later as a referee in Super Bowl XXVII in 1993, both at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California and selected as an alternate for Super Bowl XXXII in 1998. He was one of the first officials to wear a three- digit uniform number, wearing number 105 except for 1979-81, when officials were numbered separately by position. Hantak was most notable for being involved in a game that would result in the elimination of the excessive crowd noise rule from the NFL because of the actions during an exhibition game preceding the 1989 NFL season between the Cincinnati Bengals and New Orleans Saints at the Louisiana Superdome. Prior to the snap to begin a play, Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason constantly complained to Hantak about the loud crowd noise inside of the dome and would embellish his reactions in protest over the newly created rule. Esiason would later admit that he was put up to the task by then head coach Sam Wyche. Hantak was also involved in a humorous incident during a 1996 game between Pittsburgh and Carolina. On a punt the ball landed in the endzone and the Carolina mascot Sir Purr downed it, unaware the ball was live. While Steelers coach Bill Cowher was laughing, Hantak told Sir Purr not to do it again. Dick ended his distinguished officiating career with a playoff game on January 11, 2003 between the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets. As of the 2006 NFL season, Hantak serves as an NFL replay official, working on-site in the video officiating booth.

They cover an area of of the former grounds of St Mary's Abbey, and were created in the 1830s by the Yorkshire Philosophical Society along with the Yorkshire Museum which they contain. The gardens are held in trust by the City of York Council and are managed by the York Museums Trust. They were designed in a gardenesque style by landscape architect Sir John Murray Naysmith, and contain a variety of species of plants, trees and birds. Admission is free. A variety of events take place in the gardens, such as open-air theatre performances and festival activities. There are several historic buildings in the gardens. They contain the remains of the west corner of the Roman fort of Eboracum, including the Multangular Tower and parts of the Roman walls. In the same area there is also the Anglian Tower, which was probably built into the remains of a late Roman period fortress. During the Middle Ages, the tower was expanded and the Roman walls were incorporated into York's city walls. Most of the other buildings dating from the Middle Ages are associated with St Mary's Abbey, including the ruins of the abbey church, the Hospitium, the lodge and part of the surviving precinct wall. The remains of St. Leonard's Hospital chapel and undercroft are on the east side of the gardens. The Yorkshire Philosophical Society constructed several buildings in the gardens during the 19th and early 20th century, including the Yorkshire Museum and its octagonal observatory. The museum houses four permanent collections, covering biology, geology, archaeology and astronomy. History The gardens, which were given to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society by the British Royal Family in 1828, occupy part of the former grounds of St. Mary's Abbey. The society acquired the land to build a museum to house its collections; the Yorkshire Museum was completed in 1830. The land was granted to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society under the condition that botanical gardens would be established on the site. These were created during the 1830s in a gardenesque style design by landscape architect Sir John Murray Naysmith. They originally contained a conservatory, a pond and a menagerie, which was destroyed when a bear escaped from it and had brief control of the area.Feinstein, C. H. Ed. (1981), York 1831‚Äì1981: 150 years of scientific endeavour and social change, William Sessions limited, . p. 265.

Observatory York Museum Gardens cover an area of on the north bank of the River Ouse, just outside the city walls in the centre of York. There are four entrances to the gardens: on Marygate (off Bootham) by St Olave's Church, on Museum Street by Lendal Bridge, via a path at the side of King's Manor, and from the riverside walk next to the River Ouse. The site slopes gently down towards the river and is made up of historical buildings and undulating lawns interspersed with plants and trees. The gardens are open to the public during daylight hours, so the opening and closing times vary throughout the year. Normally admission is free but there are charges for some events. In 2010 it was estimated that the gardens attract 1.3 million visitors a year. Drinking alcohol, cycling and ball games are not allowed in the gardens. =Plants= The 'Edible Wood' in July 2019 There are approximately 4,500 plants and trees in the collection, some of the varieties native to England and some from other parts of the world. Planting consists of large beds containing predominantly shrubs and trees, and lawns interspersed with individual trees. Species of tree include a monkey puzzle tree along with oak and chestnut trees; six of the trees in the gardens are classed as county champion trees: Fraxinus angustifolia 'Lentiscifolia', Pyrus elaeagrifolia, Carpinus betulus 'Incisa', Alnus glutinosa 'Imperialis', Tilia cordata, Fagus sylvatica 'Miltonensis'. There is a rockery next to the Marygate entrance, by the ruins of the abbey church, and in front of the entrance to the Yorkshire Museum there is a terrace bordered with beds of white roses, the symbol of Yorkshire. There is an 'Edible Wood' located behind York Art Gallery, in the north-west corner of the gardens. The wood was planted in July 2015 and features plants that have an edible component and are both attractive and useful. =Animals= A garden visitor hand-feeding a grey squirrel The gardens are home to a population of semi-tame grey squirrels and many species of birds. A 1970 report covering the period 1965-1969 listed the vertebrates resident in the gardens at that time: Common wood pigeon, Tawny owl, Blue tit, Eurasian Wren, Dunnock, European Robin, European greenfinch, Mistle thrush, Song thrush, Blackbird, and House sparrow, Common shrew, Wood mouse, and Brown rat. In the early 19th century, the gardens included a menagerie. Henry Baines' daughter, Fanny, recalled 70 years later that in this period the menageries contained a bear, a golden eagle, and several monkeys, amongst other animals. In 1831, a bear from the menagerie got loose in the gardens and reportedly chased the Keeper of the Yorkshire Museum, John Phillips, and Reverend Harcourt into an outbuilding. The bear was subsequently sent to London Zoo. Until 2006 a family of peacocks had been in residence for at least 70 years.The peacock has landed , The Press, York (2001), and Find the missing peacock The Press, York (2006), retrieved on 24 June 2007 In 2012 the gardens was one of the release sites for a new population of the endangered Tansy beetle and, as of 2015, is one of the best places to see them in the wild. =Geology= There is a geological oddity close to the main gates, consisting of a large boulder of pink granite that was discovered during construction of the city's railway station.

It is the first time such a large exhibition of outdoor sculpture has been displayed in York. Buildings =Roman= The Multangular Tower and Roman Wall In the northeast of Museum Gardens there are remains of the west corner of the fortifications that surrounded the Roman fort of Eboracum. The original defences, consisting of turf ramparts on a green wood foundation, were built by the Ninth Legion between 71 and 74 AD. Later those were replaced by a clay mound with a turf front on a new oak foundation, and eventually wooden battlements were added, which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers.Willis, The illustrated Portrait of York, pp. 19‚Äì22 These stone defences are some of the few Roman remains that are visible above ground in York. The Multangular Tower is the western corner tower of the Roman fortress, and consists of both Roman and medieval architecture. The tower has 10 sides, from which it derives its modern name \\"multangular\\", and is 19 feet (5.8 m) high.Willis, The illustrated Portrait of York, p. 22 It was built in its late Roman form during the early 4th century, when it was constructed with three floors to house a catapult. Five Roman stone coffins are in the Multangular Tower, which were brought from graveyards in other areas of York. The inside of the Multangular Tower A 76-foot (23 m) section of 4th-century wall connects the Multangular Tower to a small interval tower. The side of the wall and towers facing into Museum Gardens is carefully faced in stone, as during the Roman period it was on display. The other side is rougher because it was originally covered by an earth bank. The wall and towers were still in use after the end of the Roman period in Britain, and were subsequently incorporated into the medieval city walls. As late as the English Civil War they were being used to defend the city, and there is a hole in the wall along from the Multangular Tower that was made by a cannonball during this period. The Roman parts of the wall and towers are constructed of regular rectangular limestone blocks with a band of red tile running through them. The later medieval additions can be identified by the use of much larger blocks of limestone that cut through the red tiles in places and by the cross shaped arrow slits on the Multangular Tower. To the north of the Multangular Tower there is a stretch of the medieval city wall with the remains of the original Roman wall running parallel to it on the city side. Built into this part of the wall is the stone Anglian Tower, which was once thought to have been built during the reign of Edwin of Northumbria, but now is generally thought to be of the very late Roman period.Hall, Richard (1996), English Heritage: Book of York, B. T. Batsford Limited, , p. 34. Behind the Anglian Tower are a series of banks showing the level of the defences during the Roman, early Middle Ages, Norman, and late medieval periods. =Medieval= :Main article for St. Mary's Abbey: St. Mary's Abbey, York Ruins of St Mary's Abbey church The gardens contain several buildings dating back to the medieval period, most of them relating to St Mary's Abbey. The Benedictine Abbey's origins date back to 1086 when Alan Count of Brittany granted St Olave's Church and the adjoining land to the monk Stephen of Whitby, who became the first abbot of St. Mary's. When St Olave's Church became too small, a larger church in a Romanesque style was built nearby, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1089 by William II. This was replaced between 1270 and 1279 by a church in a Gothic style. The abbey became the wealthiest monastery in the North of England, worth over ¬£2,085 a year before it was dissolved by Henry VIII on 25 November 1539.Wilson, Christopher and Burton, Janet (1988), St Mary's Abbey York, The Yorkshire Museum, , p. 4 Over the next 200 years the abbey fell into disrepair and the abbey church was largely dismantled for its stone. Stones from the abbey church can be seen lining paths throughout the gardens, but the major ruins of the church are on the western side. The church was aligned on a northeast axis because of the shape and size of the site, instead of pointing to the east, the normal alignment for churches in England. Part of the north and west walls that formed the nave and crossing, designed in Gothic style by architect Simon of Pabenham in the 13th century, remain standing. The ruins include dummy lancet windows, tracery windows and \\"tracery remains to show that the patterns alternated between a single large circle over two lights and three small circles over three lights\\".Wilson and Burton, St Mary's Abbey York p. 8 The column capitals are decorated with foliage in a stiff-leaf style as well as in a naturalistic style, although this stonework is weatherworn and so this decoration is hard to distinguish. Sections of the foundations of the church and its Norman predecessor are exposed, and a plan of their layouts can be seen in the grass. Finds excavated from the site, including life-sized statues of Christian saints, can be seen in the Yorkshire Museum.Wilson and Burton, St Mary's Abbey York pp. 4‚Äì9 St.Mary's Lodge as seen from Marygate St Mary's Lodge was built around 1470 as an addition to the late 12th-century buildings that formed the gatehouse at the main entrance to the abbey, ‚Äì now the Marygate entrance to the gardens. Some remains of the 12th-century gatehouse can still be seen, in particular the archway attached to the side of the lodge. The lodge is built of stone, and does not contain timber framing like the nearby Hospitium. The lodge, along with the attached railings, gates and gate piers are all Grade I listed buildings, which means that they are of outstanding interest. Originally, the lodge may have been used as a guesthouse for the abbey, and was the point where the poor could claim alms from the abbey. After the abbey's dissolution, the lodge became a courthouse until 1722, when part of the building became the Brown Cow pub. In 1840 John Philips, the Yorkshire Museum's curator, restored and converted it to use as his home while retaining its external appearance. The lodge subsequently became used as offices, and during the early 21st century became the headquarters of the York Museums Trust. The Hospitium Along with the lodge, some of the abbey's precinct walls are still standing. A section of the remaining walls runs along the north-west part of the gardens and extends further along Marygate to Bootham. The walls were constructed in 1266 and increased in height and crenellated in 1318 under a royal licence from Edward III. Originally there was a defensive ditch along the outside of the walls. The walls include several towers, not all of them dating from the medieval period; the semicircular tower near the gatehouse is a 19th-century reconstruction. The walls and towers were used for the abbey's defence, e.g. in disputes with the City of York over land ownership and taxes, and played a role in the defence of the city during the Siege of York. St. Leonard Hospital Undercroft The Hospitium is located between the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and is thought to have originally been a guest house for visitors to the abbey of low social rank, or possibly a barn. It was originally part of a group of buildings in the abbey grounds that included a brew-house, stables, mill and, near the main gate, a boarding school with 50 pupils. The oldest parts of the ground floor were built around 1300, but the upper storey has been extensively restored in modern times. The ruined gateway at the side dates back to the 15th century, and was probably the entrance to a passage that ran towards the water-gate by the river.Wilson and Burton, St Mary's Abbey York, pp. 11‚Äì12 The remains of St. Leonard's Hospital chapel and undercroft are on the east side of the gardens, by the Museum Street entrance. The hospital was the largest in England during the Middle Ages, and was run by a community of men and women of the Augustinian order. During the 14th century, the hospital could have contained as many as 240 patients, 18 clergy and 30 choristers.British Archaeology News, British Archaeology magazine (2007). Retrieved 2 September 2007. St. Leonard's Hospital was closed during the dissolution of the monasteries, when it was surrendered to Henry VIII by Thomas Magnus.Butler, R. M., (1886), Medieval York, York Architectural and York Archaeological Society, , p. 13. The undercroft and chapel were part of the infirmary built between 1225 and 1250. The interior of the undercroft, accessible from the gardens, has a rib vaulted ceiling and houses a collection of Roman and medieval stonework. In 1999, the hospital and surrounding area in Museum Gardens was one of three sites in York to feature in an edition of the British Channel 4 television show Time Team. Between the Museum Street entrance to the gardens and the River Ouse is a short stretch of York's city walls, which ends at the medieval Lendal Tower. =19th and 20th century= The entrance to the Yorkshire Museum William Hincks was instrumental in establishing the gardens. Henry John Wilkinson reports as follows: \\"Mr. Hincks was lecturer on botany at the York School of Medicine, and the services he rendered to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society for over ten years deserve our grateful thanks. He devoted his leisure time to convert the \\" waste land \\" into a botanical and ornamental* garden, and in this work he was ably assisted by the late sub-curator, Henry Baines. \\" Wilkinson, Henry John. 1907. Historical Account of the Herbarium of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society and the Contributors Thereto. The Yorkshire Philosophical Society constructed several buildings in the gardens during the 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Yorkshire Museum, one of the first purpose-built museums in Britain.Welcome to the Yorkshire Museum , York Museums Trust (2006), retrieved on 14 October 2007 The Yorkshire Museum was designed by architect William Wilkins in a Greek Revival style and was officially opened in February 1830. On 26 September 1831 the inaugural meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held at the Yorkshire Museum.Willis, Ronald (1988), The illustrated portrait of York, Robert Hale Limited, 4th Edition, , p. 176.

There are two stuffed specimens of the extinct great auk, an almost complete skeleton of an extinct moa and a large collection of specimens from the Yorkshire region including the remains of elephants, cave bears and hyena from Kirkdale Cave dated to the Quaternary period, around 125,000 years ago. The geological collection contains over 112,500 specimens of rocks, minerals and fossils. Fossils make up most of the collection numbering over 100,000 samples, and include important specimens from the Carboniferous, Mesozoic and Tertiary periods.Biology, and Geology, York Museums Trust (2006), retrieved on 8 September 2007. The archaeology collection has close to a million objects that date from around 500,000 BC to the 20th century, including the Coppergate Helmet discovered in York in 1982, and the Ormside Bowl, an intricate example of an Anglian silversmith.Archaeology, York Museums Trust (2006), retrieved on 24 June 2007. The Observatory Most of the museum's astronomy collection is housed in the octagonal observatory in the centre of the gardens, built during 1832 and 1833. The design of its rotating roof is credited to John Smeaton designer of the Eddystone Lighthouse.Whitworth, Alan Ed. (2000), Aspects of York: Discovering local history, Warncliffe Books, , p. 116. A telescope built in 1850 by the instrument maker Thomas Cooke of York was installed during the observatory's 1981 restoration. It is Yorkshire's oldest working observatory and as of August 2007 was opened to the public by a team of volunteers. The building is currently opened every Thursday and Saturday 11.30 until 2.30. The clock in the observatory was made by Barraud of London in 1811, and during the 19th century it was used to set the time for other clocks in York. At the eastern, Museum Street, entrance to the gardens is Museum Gardens' Lodge built in 1874 to a design by George Fowler Jones in a Victorian Gothic revival style. The lodge now houses the Yorkshire Philosophical Society's offices and reading room.Yorkshire Philosophical Society, About the Society, Yorkshire Philosophical Society (2007), retrieved on 9 September 2007. The curator's house, built in 1844 and originally called the keeper's house, is located by King's Manor. It was designed by J B Atkinson and was built using reclaimed limestone from St. Mary's Abbey. Tempest Anderson Hall The Tempest Anderson Hall is a 300-seat auditorium-style lecture theatre built in 1912 as an annexe to the Yorkshire Museum. Dr Tempest Anderson, a York surgeon and vulcanologist, presented the hall to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society to replace its existing lecture theatre. Designed by E Ridsdale Tate, it is an early example of the use of reinforced concrete and is a Grade I listed building. In the late 20th century it housed a cinema, but it is now used as a conference venue and lecture theatre. =Swimming baths= York's first swimming bath was located in the south-west corner of the Museum Gardens. It was an open-air pool designed by the architects Samuel and Richard Hey Sharp, one of the designers of the Yorkshire Museum, and measured by and had a capacity of approximately 290,000 gallons. It opened to the public on 8 August 1837, and employed a Keeper of the baths throughout its lifespan.

The fist and feet work in unison and strike continuously forward, like \\"falling meteorites\\", never giving the opponent a moment to recover. The qinggong portion of this style's training involves a practitioner jumping against a wall with heavy weights affixed to his/her calves. This style is practiced mainly in central Hebei, northern China, Beijing and Liaoning in North-eastern China. History Chu≈çji«éo originated in the Northern Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1127) and became popular during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368‚Äì1911). The source from Wu Binlou, a famous Chuojiao expert and founder of Beijing style, believed Chu≈çji«éo comes from the Wen Family Boxing style of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279). Chu≈çji«éo is attributed to Deng Liang, who is said to have created the style on the basis of the 18 basic feet plays. He developed the basics according to calculations of the Chinese abacus to form a chain of feet plays incorporating 108 tricks. According to legend, he later taught the monk Zhou Tong the style, who later passed it on to his pupil General Yue Fei. Some of the outlaws who appear in the famous novel The Water Margin, such as Wu Song, were experts in this style; this is why Chuojiaoquan was alternately known as the \\"Water Margin Outlaw style\\". It is also known as YuƒÅnyƒÅng Tu«ê (È¥õÈ¥¶ËÖø) or \\"Mandarin Duck Leg.\\" In The Water Margin's 28th chapter, entitled \\"Drunken Wu Song beats Jiang Menshen innkeeper\\", it mentions that Wu Song uses the following moves: \\"step of nephrite ring, leg of mandarin duck\\". Feng Keshan (ÂÜØÂÖãÂñÑ), a general in the failed Taiping Rebellion of the early 19th century, was a Chu≈çji«éo FƒÅnziqu√°n master. After the failure of the rebellion, Feng went into seclusion with two other experts Tang Youyi in Hebei Province in Raoyang, where he taught FƒÅnziqu√°n, which emphasizes the hands, to the Wang family and Chu≈çji«éo, which emphasizes the feet, to the Duan family. During practice, the families would exchange techniques. Styles After Master Zhao Canyi (ËµµÁÅøÁõä), Chuojiao has evolved into many branches such as those below(2005)\\"Chinese Traditional Kung Fu\\", Volume 2, Number 1Liu, Xue Bo (2004) \\"Chuojiao Huizong\\" . /Z.4641982‚Äì2008 - \\"Wu-Lin\\" Chinese Martial Arts Magazine, Beijing: Liu Family Chuojiao:Was spread throughout Li County, so much so that a large proportion of the county can practice some aspects of Chuojiao even until today. Liu Guanlan taught third generation Guo Gexi, Liu Songlin, Liu Zhenguo, Li Gepu and Liu Zhenjiang. Liu Family Chuojiao is representative of Lixian Chuojiao or Hebei Chuojiao. Current Representatives include Zhang Shuanglong, Wang Zhiyi, Zhang Xiaowang, Liu Zhenmin, Liu Xuehui and Cui Linsheng. Duan Family Chuojiao: The Duan brothers taught in Raoyang the following third generation: Liu Laowang, Li Timing, Jia Laokai, Zhang Laoxiao, and others. This style is typically known as Raoyang Chuojiao. Current representatives of Raoyang Chuojiao include Li Jiantao, Song Qingbo, Ma Yongchao, Li Juncai, Li Zhenguo and Li Jiankuan. Wang Family Chuojiao: Wang Zhanao who studied with his father Wang Zhiguo and Zhao Canyi, taught Zhang Jingtian, Wang Zhongli who then taught others. Additionally he taught Xu Zhaoxiong who then took the style to Dongbei. Zhao Family Chuojiao: Zhao Yiguan taught in the Gaoyang and Baoding areas including Zhao Zhenben, Zhao Laoxian, Chen Yuanhu, Zhou Yuxiang and others. Noting that this style had consolidated influences in earlier generations via Wang Zhiguo and in latter generations from Raoyang (Li Timing) and Lixian (Liu Zhenjiang). This style was commonly referred to as Gaoyang Chuojiao. Some of the Current representatives of Zhao Family Chuojiao include Zhao Haowei and Wu Chanlong (Nephy Perez) Wei Family Chuojiao: Wei Changyi taught many including the sharing with Xingyi practitioners, but his main disciple was Wei Zankui who in turn taught the famous Beijing Chuojiaofanzi Wu Binlou. Additionally Wei Laofang taught Chuojiao in Li county and his disciples spread the art in Zhangjiakou and western regions of China such as Gansu province. Some branches are also known as Lixian Chuojiao. Some of the current representatives of Beijing ChuojiaoFanzi include Hong Zhitian and Liu Xuebo. Current Representative of the Wei Laofang school includes Sun Deyu and Kang Yiwu. see www.halifaxwushu.com for more information on this branch Yin Family Chuojiao: Yin Chun Zhang taught his son Yin Ruyan, who in turn taught Yin Xuelang. Yin Xuelang had held the skills within the family until the late 20th century when he taught Liu Renyi and Zhang Hong, the current masters and propagators of this family's Chuojiao. This style is also referred to as \\"Gu Zhizi\\". Later branches derived from the original ones above include: Zhang Family Chuojiao: Zhang Jing Tian, was a disciple of Master Wang Zhi Guo. He passed his skills to Zhang Heng Qing, nicknamed \\"Iron Leg Zhang Heng Qing\\" taught Chuojiao in Yangzhou to Wang Qing Fu, He Yu Shan, Tian Chun and others Gao Family Chuojiao: In Shenyang a master from Li county by the name of Gao Bai Quan passed on a Chuo jiao style named \\"Di Gong Chuo Jiao\\" (Ground Skill Chuo Jiao). Master Gao was born in Li county and commenced the practice of Chuo Jiao at the age of 11 under master Wang Yong Cen (a disciple of Wei Lao Fang who studied with Zhao Can Yi). Xu Family Chuojiao: Xu Zhaoxiong, was a student of Wang Zhanao (Son of Wang Zhiguo and disciple of Zhao Canyi). Master Xu brought his Chuojiao and propagated the art in Dongbei areas (Liaoning etc.). This is also known as Dongbei Chuojiao. Hu Family Chuojiao: Hu Feng San, nicknamed \\"Hua Qiang Hu\\" (Flower Spear Hu) for his command of the spear, was a master of other martial arts (Shaolin, Xingyi etc.) prior to studying with the Duan brothers in Raoyang. He taught sequences of Wen Tang Zi (Scholarly Sequences) to students in the city of Shenyang in Liaoning Province, that he was said to have created after studying with the Duan brothers in Rao Yang. It is said that he mastered great Duan family's short kicks. This is also known as Dongbei Chuojiao. Techniques The martial routine was the origin of Chuojiao (poking feet boxing). The martial routine in Shenyang later became known as the Hao-style Chuojiao, namely feet poking boxing named after Hao Mingjiu. It features powerful but comfortable moves and its blows are accurate and incorporate a variety of subtle feet tricks. Hands and feet cooperate well for better advantage and longer reach. Its strikes are short but fatal. Hardness is the core of Chuojiao which it combines with suppleness. Its routine consists of nine inter-connected twin feet routines. These routines can be practised either one by one, or linked together. The feet plays call for close cooperation between the feet which is why it is called twin feet play. Another feet poking Chuan is called nine-tumble 18-fall Chuan. The scholarly routine is a derivative of the martial routine. It is said that during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1875‚Äì1908) in the Qing dynasty, boxer Hu Fengsan of Shenyang learned of the fame of Chuojiao masters, the Duans in Hebei Province, and traveled 500 kilometers to study with him. After years of hard work, Hu came to understand the secrets of Chuojiao and went back to his native town, where he further developed the art into the scholarly routine, known later as the Hu-style Chuojiao. It is characterized by its exquisite and compact stances and clear-cut, accurate and varied movements. It is also very fast in delivering both fist and feet blows. The scholarly style features such routines as 12-move Chuan, 18-move Chuan, flying swallow Chuan (small flying swallow Chuan), arm Chuan, turning-ring Chuan, jade-ring Chuan, six-method Chuan, two-eight Chuan, two-eight feet plays, 16-move Chuan, 24-move Chuan, 32-move Chuan, soft tumbling Chuan, one-legged 80-move feet plays, one-handed 81-move fist plays, etc. The martial-scholar tumbling Chuan has combined the strengths of the martial and scholar routines, especially the combative techniques. It is arranged according to the rhythms of offence and defence of the martial arts and combines high-low, release-catch, extension- flexion and straight-rounded movements.

Muhammad V was the eldest son and heir of Yusuf I by his slave Butayna, born on Sunday, 4 January, 1339. He also had a younger full-blood sister, A'isha, two half brothers and five half-sisters. He ruled between 1354‚Äì1359 and 1362‚Äì1391, and is best known for completing the royal palace of the Alhambra with the Palace of the Lions and the Mexuar, or Cuarto Dorado. Sultan He inherited the throne from Yusuf I but was overthrown in August 1359 by his half-brother Ismail II and sought protection with the Marinid sultan of Fez, where Muhammad was inspired with fresh examples of architecture. Isma'il was overthrown and murdered with his brother Qays less than a year later in 1360, by his brother- in-law, Abu Said, who ruled as Muhammad VI but was overthrown in turn by Muhammad V, who returned to the throne for another 29 years. During the three- year period of the reign of Muhammad VI, Muhammad V was plotting his return to power. A chance came in 1362 when King Peter I of Castile (Pedro el Cruel) lured Muhammad VI to his kingdom. There, in Seville, he was murdered and his head sent to Muhammad V as a gift upon his return to the throne. As a gesture of good relations between him and the Marinid, the eldest son of Muhammad V, Yusuf II, married to a daughter of the Marinid Sultan. His hospital in Granada was completed in 1366. He employed the poet and diplomat Ibn Khaldun in negotiations with Pedro the Cruel. Death Muhammad V died on 16 January, 1391. He had at least four sons; Yusuf II, Nasr, Muhammad and Sa'd.

He was active in the Jura Federation, a section of the International Working Men's Association (IWMA), from the northwestern part of Switzerland and the Alsace. He helped edit the Bulletin de la F√©d√©ration Jurassienne, along with anarchist Peter Kropotkin. He was in contact with Gustave Brocher between 1877 and 1880, who became anarchist under Brousse's influence. Paul Brousse edited two newspapers, one in French and another in German. He helped James Guillaume publish its bulletin. Paul Brousse studied medicine and travelled to Barcelona in his youth. He then joined the IWMA and participated to the Geneva Congress in September 1873, seeing anarchism as the only possible social organization. On 18 March 1877 he took part in Bern in a demonstration in remembrance of the 1871 Paris Commune, which ended in riots with the police. Paul Brousse was subsequently condemned to one month of prison. In 1877 he published (initially anonymously) the revolutionary song Le drapeau rouge (known in English as The Standard of Revolt). On 15 April 1879 he was again sentenced to two months of prison, then expelled from Switzerland for having published an article in L'Avant-Garde which legitimized the propaganda of the deed attempts of Giovanni Passannante, Juan Oliva Moncasi, Max H√∂del and Karl Nobiling. Paul Brousse returned to France in 1880 and progressively became more reformist. He began to take part in the French Workers' Party (POF) and then, after a scission, to the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France (FTSF), which became known as the \\"possibilists\\". He voted at the 1896 international congress in London along with Jules Guesde for the expulsion of the \\"anti-authoritarian socialists\\", as were known the anarchists. The possibilists then joined Jean Jaur√®s's French Socialist Party in 1902, which fused with others movements in 1905 to create the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).

Equal to of an inch, it is normally referred to as a thou, a thousandth, or (particularly in the United States) a mil. The plural of thou is also thou (thus one hundredth of an inch is \\"10 thou\\"), while the plural of mil is mils (thus \\"10 mils\\"). Thou is pronounced like , not like . The words are shortened forms of the English and Latin words for \\"thousand\\" (mille). The US customary mil can be confused with the millimetre, which is the standard meaning for \\"mil\\" or \\"mils\\" (plural) in British English and European engineering circles. This can cause problems with spoken dimensions or with those who are not familiar with alternative uses of the term. One mil is (), or approximately one fortieth of a millimetre. Contexts of use The thou, or mil, is most commonly used in engineering and manufacturing in non-metric countries. For example in specifying: * The thickness of items such as paper, film, foil, wires, paint coatings, latex gloves, plastic sheeting, and fibers  For example, most plastic ID cards are about in thickness.  Card stock thickness in the US is usually measured in points or mils that gives the thickness of the sheet in thousandths of an inch.  Gauge (diameter) of strings in stringed instruments * Manufacturing dimensions and tolerances, such as:  In the manufacture of older automobile engines (A typical example is the thickness of the head gasket, or the amount of material to be removed from the head to adjust the compression ratio of the cylinders.)  In the servicing of older automobile engines (Typical examples include a spark-plug gap or ignition points gap.)  The manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs) (although the component dimensions are now typically provided in millimetres, because they are sold worldwide)  Tolerance specifications on hydraulic cylinders There are also compound units such as \\"mils per year\\" used to express corrosion rates.\\"Corrosion Rate Conversion\\", Corrosionist.com A related measurement for area known as the circular mil, is based on a circle having a diameter of one mil. =Tenths= In machining, where the thou is often treated as a basic unit, can be referred to as \\"one tenth\\", meaning \\"one tenth of a thou\\" or \\"one ten thousandth\\".\\"...the smallest move of one-tenth (not 0.1 but 0.0001 of an inch)...\\", Dan Nelson, The CNC Toolbox, p89 (The metric comparison is discussed below.) Machining \\"to within a few tenths\\" is often considered very accurate, and at or near the extreme limit of tolerance capability in most contexts. Greater accuracy (tolerance ranges inside one tenth) apply in only a few contexts: in plug gauge and gauge block manufacturing or calibration, they are typically expressed in millionths of an inch or, alternatively, in micrometres; in nanotechnology, nanometres or picometres are used. =Usage notes on mil versus thou= In the United States, mil was once the more common term, but as use of the metric system has become more common, thou has replaced mil among most technical users to .Mil at How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement by Russ RowlettUniversity of Queensland: PCB design FAQThou at How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement by Russ Rowlett Today both terms are used, but in specific contexts one is traditionally preferred over the other. Equivalence to other units of length =Unit conversions= 1 thou is equal to: * 0.001 international inches (1 international inch is equal to 1,000 thou) * 0.0254 mm, or 25.4 Œºm (1 millimetre is about 39.37 thou) History of usage The introduction of the thousandth of an inch as a sensible base unit in engineering and machining is generally attributed to Joseph Whitworth who wrote in 1857: :...instead of our engineers and machinists thinking in eighths, sixteenths and thirty-seconds of an inch, it is desirable that they should think and speak in tenths, hundredths, and thousandths...\\"A Paper on Standard Decimal Measures of Length\\", Manchester, 1857 Whitworth's main point was to advocate decimalization in place of fractions based on successive halving; but in mentioning thousandths, he was also broaching the idea of a finer division than had been used previously. Up until this era, workers such as millwrights, boilermakers, and machinists measured only in traditional fractions of an inch, divided via successive halving, usually only as far as 64ths (1, , , , , , ). Each 64th is about 16 thou. Communication about sizes smaller than a 64th of an inch was subjective and hampered by a degree of ineffability‚Äîwhile phrases such as \\"scant 64th\\" or \\"heavy 64th\\" were used, their communicative ability was limited by subjectivity. Dimensions and geometry could be controlled to high accuracy, but this was done by comparative methods: comparison against templates or other gauges, feeling the degree of drag of calipers, or simply repeatably cutting, relying on the positioning consistency of jigs, fixtures, and machine slides. Such work could only be done in craft fashion: on-site, by feel, rather than at a distance working from drawings and written notes. Although measurement was certainly a part of the daily routine, the highest-precision aspects of the work were achieved by feel or by gauge, not by measuring (as in determining counts of units). This in turn limited the kinds of process designs that could work, because they limited the degree of separation of concerns that could occur. The introduction of thou as a base unit for machining work required the dissemination of vernier calipers and screw micrometers throughout the trade, as the unit is too small to be measured with practical repeatability using rules alone. (Most rule markings were far too wide to mark a single mil, and even if such dividing is accomplished, it is illegible to the naked eye, being discernible but not useful for measuring.) During the following half century, such measuring instruments went from expensive rarities to widespread, everyday tools among machinists. Bringing more metrology into machining increased the separation of concerns to make possible, for example, designing an assembly to the point of an engineering drawing, then having the mating parts made at different firms who did not have any contact with (or even awareness of) each other‚Äîyet still knowing with certainty that their products would have the desired fit.

Terms and sittings Hearings of the Supreme Court take place exclusively in the Supreme Court building in Ottawa. The Court sits three times a year for three months at a time starting in January, April, and October. Every two weeks that the Court sits is followed by a two-week break making for a total of 18 weeks a year of hearings. The Mondays are often reserved for hearing motions regarding ongoing appeals. The remaining days of the week the Court is used for hearings. The Court will hear one or two cases a day beginning at 9:30 a.m. Quorum of the Court requires five Justices, but most cases are heard by a panel of seven or nine Justices. The Chief Justice presides over each hearing. If the Chief Justice is not available, the senior puisne justice on the panel will preside. Hearings are live-streamed through the Court's website. They are also video recorded for delayed telecast in both of Canada's official languages and are often aired on CPAC. The Court's hearings are open to the public except for certain sensitive cases where a sealing order is enacted. There are three rows of benches reserved for public seating, which are generally taken on a first-come, first-served basis except where it is reserved by counsel or parties in the appeal. Leave to appeal Initially, all civil and criminal cases had the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. An amendment to the Supreme Court Act in 1975 required that parties wishing to appeal must apply for \\"leave to appeal\\". The only exception is a select type of more serious criminal cases where there continues to an appeal \\"as of right\\", as well as appeals from reference questions submitted to the provincial courts of appeal by the provincial governments. The federal government also has the power to pose a reference to the Court on its own motion, as an original proceeding, without requiring leave from the Court. Leave applications are considered by the justices in groups of three. Only cases which raise questions of public importance are granted.See the following: R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368 at 397, MacDonald v. City of Montreal, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460 at 512 and R. v. Hinse, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597 at 610, 629. The reasons for their decisions on leave applications are not given. Hearings On the bench, the Chief Justice of Canada (or the senior puisne justice) presides from the centre chair with the other justices seated to the right and left of the Chief Justice by order of seniority of appointment. At sittings of the Court, the justices usually appear in black silk robes but they wear their ceremonial robes of bright scarlet trimmed with Canadian white mink in court on special occasions and in the Senate at the opening of each new session of Parliament. Historically, they were addressed as \\"My Lord/Lady\\" during sessions of the court, but the Court has indicated that it prefers that the judges be addressed as \\"Justice\\", \\"Mr Justice\\" or \\"Madam Justice\\".Supreme Court of Canada: Frequently Asked Questions - \\"How does one address a judge?\\" Each side is given one hour to make their submissions. Where there are multiple claimants or defendants they are required to split the time among them. However, in exceptional circumstances the parties may apply to the Court to have their time extended. Interveners are typically granted ten minutes to make their arguments. Reasons Occasionally, the Court may give judgment from the bench, either dismissing or allowing the appeal on the spot. The Court may give short reasons explaining its decision at that time, or it may announce the outcome of the case, with reasons to follow. The more common practice is that once the hearing is complete, the judges convene immediately in their conference room behind the court room to discuss the case. They sit at a round table in the conference room and each judge gives their opinion of the case, starting with the least senior judge. Typically, once the discussion is complete the justices make a tentative decision of the case, and in most cases a decision will be arrived at by the end the day. Retired Justice Binnie has coined the term the \\"sundown rule\\" for this practice. http://online.cle.bc.ca/CourseMaterial/pdfs/2001/262_13_1.pdf This practice was begun by Chief Justice Cartwright in the 1960s. It was intended to reduce the number of separate reasons that the court was generating at the time and to maintain relations among the judges.see C. L'Heureux-Dube, \\"The Dissenting Opinion: Voice of the Future?\\" (2000) Osgoode Hall Law Journal. Except where the reasons are announced orally at the hearing, the Court normally reserves its decision. While the case is on reserve, the judges spend a considerable amount of time producing detailed written reasons for judgment. That process may take several months, or over a year. There is normally a majority decision, but judges who disagree with the majority can write a minority opinion, dissenting in whole or in part from the majority. Any judge can write a concurring opinion, agreeing with either the majority or the minority, or setting out the judge's own separate position. While the reasons for judgment are being developed, they may be rewritten several times. There may be a significant amount of continued debate over how the propositions should be articulated and what should be left out. In the more divided cases, there is a possibility that a judge may switch sides during the process and change the outcome of the case.

Biography Fitzgerald was a member of the Senior Executive Service, a management systems deputy, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. He was responsible for the development of improved management controls generally, specifically including management information control systems, economic cost effectiveness analysis, statistical programs and analysis, cost estimating and analysis, and productivity enhancement and measurement. The latter responsibility includes supervising Air Force performance measurement activities. Following service in the U.S. Navy, Fitzgerald earned a bachelor of science degree in industrial engineering from the University of Alabama. He is a registered professional engineer and has worked on several successful patents, including one issued in his name. He is the author of \\"The High Priests of Waste\\" and \\"The Pentagonists.\\" Fitzgerald died in Falls Church, Virginia on January 31, 2019 at the age of 92.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/a-ernest-fitzgerald- pentagon-whistleblower-fired-by-nixon-dies- at-92/2019/02/07/2f3277f4-2afe-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html Career After working for a number of years as an engineer and in management, Fitzgerald was employed by the U.S. Air Force as Deputy for Management Systems in 1965. While employed at the Pentagon Fitzgerald testified to Congress in 1968 and 1969 about the concealed cost overruns and the technical problems of the Lockheed C-5A transport airplane. He was accused of revealing classified information and was fired on order of President Richard M. Nixon. He later successfully appealed to the Civil Service Commission to be reinstated. Furthermore, he was involved in several legal cases that were significant in establishing presidential immunity and defining the rights of government employees, including the U.S. Supreme Court case Nixon v. Fitzgerald. Whistleblower In 1968, Fitzgerald reported a $2.3 billion cost overrun in the Lockheed C-5 aircraft program.The Journal of Public Inquiry Spring/Summer 2009 As a congressional witness before the Joint Economic Committee, he rejected the advice of Air Force officials and testified with candor and transparency about billions of dollars in avionics program cost overruns and other technical problems. In response to Fitzgerald's testimony, President Richard M. Nixon directed that he be fired. \\"It was reported that Nixon told aides to 'get rid of that son of a bitch.'\\" In executing the president's order, Fitzgerald was ultimately terminated by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird. Because of his candor and commitment to the truth, Fitzgerald was a driving force for whistleblower protections. Fitzgerald continued to fight a four- decade-long campaign against fraud, waste, and abuse within the department. On page 108 in his book _The Pentagonists_ , he states that \\"The Carter Reform Act  or, as many people I knew called it, the Carter Deform Act  was a reckless reversal of governmental progress since 1883, and promised some dire developments.\\" His fears of its chilling effects on future whistleblowers was fully justified (see the similarly misnamed Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 for a history of how that turned out).

Its name is based on it being a theater in the round, featuring a rotating circular stage with none of its 3,743 seats further than 50 feet (15 m) from the stage. Unlike similar venues across the United States, the Circle Star Theatre stage had the ability to rotate in either direction without limit, thanks to the slip ring and brush system that supplied electrical/audio to and from the stage. The theatre's address was 2 Circle Star Way, San Carlos, CA 94070. Its original concept when it opened in the early 1960s was a dinner theater similar to the Hyatt House Theatre in nearby Burlingame. Lewis & Dare productions hosted many Broadway touring shows, such as The Odd Couple, with Ernest Borgnine and Don Rickles. In 1971, the theatre was purchased by Marquee Entertainment, run by Don Jo Medlevine of the famed Chicago nightclub Chez Paree. Marquee Entertainment booked Las Vegas acts such as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dean Martin, and Liberace, among many others. In the mid-1970s the theatre was kept solvent by booking Motown acts to increase its diversity.

Bloom later sold the theater to a local car dealer. The new ownership did not have the same elite relationships with the top entertainers as Bloom had, so it was closed in December 1993. The building caught fire on April 18, 1997, damaging much of the backstage area, though by this time plans had already been made for its demolition.

It lies about north of Burnham-on-Crouch and south-east of Maldon; and approximately east-northeast of London. To the north is the River Blackwater, which is tidal and since Roman times has been the gateway to trading in the area. History Southminster is in the centre of the Dengie peninsula, which once formed a hundred of the same name. A major horse market used to be held annually in the town. Southminster marshes were a favourite centre for hare coursing in Victorian times. Pandole Wood contains ancient earthworks believed to date from the Iron Age. The landscape surrounding the town, and elsewhere on the peninsula, is characterized by a pattern of strictly rectangular field boundaries, with evidence of a unit of measurement having been applied to the scheme as a whole. Middle Saxon administrations have been suggested as its origin, although the road to the Roman Saxon Shore fort of Othona at Bradwell- on-Sea also conforms to the pattern. St Leonard's Church The medieval St Leonard's Church dates mainly from the 15th century, although there are traces of much earlier work. It is a relatively large, \\"townish\\" church by Essex standards. The church also stands at an important road junction, contrasting with the familiar Essex pattern of a church and manor house complex on the same site. These features are consistent with John Blair's formulation of an Anglo-Saxon minster, in contrast to a private oratory in its origins, and the place-name would perhaps suggest Cedd's mission at the Chapel of St Peter-on- the-Wall near Bradwell (to the north) as its parent. Several well-known clergymen are associated with the church, including naturalist Walter Henry Hill, curate from 1832 to 1839, and Alexander John Scott, rector 1805 to 1840 but previously personal chaplain to Horatio Nelson. After the Battle of Trafalgar Nelson died in the arms of Scott, and several artefacts that once belonged to Scott are found in the church. The church also gives its name to the town's local football team, Southminster St. Leonards F.C. There is also a brick-built United Reformed Church building in North Street, Southminster. Facilities The town has an infant and a primary school, a small library, a handful of pubs, a swimming pool, a brewery and cidery and one holiday park. Transport Southminster railway station, the terminus of a single-line branch that was electrified in the 1980s, provides services to Wickford and Liverpool Street station in the City of London. In Literature Southminster is the name given to the fictional cathedral city featured in the short story 'An Episode of Cathedral History' by M.R. James, published in A Thin Ghost and Others, his third collection of Ghost Stories published in 1919.

They are best known by their stage names Chin Er, Min Er, Kai Er, and Hong Er (the Chinese word \\"er\\" means \\"child\\" or \\"young\\"), though in the last several years of their performances, they began to use their given names more frequently. Career Originally known as \\"Four Little Golden Princesses\\", and commonly abbreviated to FGP or 4GP, they were recruited by recording company Ya-Ko Enterprise around 1995, after mass success of child star, Crystal Ong Shir Ching, who is currently a member of M-girls. At that time, the members of Four Golden Princesses averaged 5‚Äì6 years of age (Ginger was born in 1988 and the others in 1990 or mid 80's). Each of them hail from different parts of Malaysia, but they were brought together at company headquarters in Kuala Lumpur on school holidays and weekends for recording sessions or promotions. As they grew older and remained popular, the word \\"Little\\" was quietly dropped from the group name. They made their debut effort in a compilation album in August 1996 (album title unknown). Under the management of Ya-Ko Enterprise, the Four Golden Princesses released 3 Happy Children‚Äôs Songs albums and 1 Chinese New Year 1997 album. Each album grossed more than 50,000 copies sold worldwide, which made an astonishing figure for local artists. In September 1997, the parents of Four Golden Princesses filed a lawsuit against Ya-Ko Enterprise for the non-payment of contractual fees. The parents claimed that they had only received partial payment for one-and-a-half albums. With the lawsuit was settled out of court, Four Golden Princess was permanently switched to another recording company called \\"Wayang Tinggi Entertainment (WTE)\\" as of 1 October 1997. Over the years with WTE, Four Golden Princesses has recorded and filmed over 20 albums (8 albums under the Children‚Äôs Wonderland series, 3 under the Golden Folk Songs series, and 10 Chinese New Year albums). Each of them are best sellers, giving the group's title \\"Super Child Star\\". They also recorded a number of popular songs (especially in their teens) with several songs that are combinations of Chinese and American songs. Their Chinese New Year albums have become a trademark success. At what was perhaps the peak of their child-group popularity around 1999‚Äì2001, their album \\"Dancing Dragons Dazzle in Beijing City 1999\\" sold over 100,000 copies in Malaysia and another 450,000 in China; \\"Lovable Dragon Year 2000\\" over 125,000; and their \\"Dance of the Golden Snake 2001\\" over 100,000 in Malaysia alone. In early 2003, Min Er announced her intention to leave the group to concentrate on her studies. She had always been the most academically diligent member of the group and dreamt of a career as a doctor since childhood. However, much to the relief of their legion of fans, Min Er decided to remain in the group after much persuasion from her friends and fans. On June 5, 2004, Four Golden Princesses celebrated their 10th anniversary as a group with a mini concert at Malaysia‚Äôs UE3. They were the first child group to last 10 years (or even 5 years) from Malaysia‚Äôs music scene. Along with growing up, they have progressed from singing nursery rhymes to children songs to school folk songs and love songs. All these categories of songs were showcased in this concert. Hearing Four Golden Princesses re-sing their nursery tunes again, a childhood innocence in their voice is no longer felt. Around November 2004, a video from their very early days circulated around the internet in Taiwan. \\"The Laughing Song\\" featuring their shaking heads and funny lyrics caused the internet news to spread quickly. \\"Why is Math class your favorite? Because my teacher is always absent!\\" or \\"Today I got 100%, English 50%, Math 50%, add it together, and I have 100%\\" became favorite quotes amongst Taiwan teens. Taiwan youth even filmed their own version of the music video to this song. Although this sudden surge of popularity in Taiwan was a result from them being mocked, it also led numerous people to learn about the recent Four Golden Princesses and converted some into fans as well. One of the websites devoted to Four Golden Princess, www.fourgoldenprincess.com, was so overwhelmed by the number of people visiting that its bandwidth ran out very early in the month, something that never happened before. The last album was released for Chinese New Year 2008, followed by their disbandment, though the members occasionally get together to do public performances during the Chinese new years. Their reason was that they want to lead to a normal life. In late September 2012, behind the scene pictures of the two Four Golden Princesses members Ginger and Richell filming a CNY album with 6 other artists appeared on the Facebook page 8Â§ßË¥∫Â≤Å. It was confirmed that the group ÂÖ´Â§ßÂ∑®Êòü(Eight Superstars) would reform. Four Golden Princesses were previously in their 1999 CNY album and briefly in their 2000 CNY album. The page said that the album would be released in December. On 22 July 2013, Nick Chung(A Chinese Malaysian artist) leaked a photograph of himself on his Facebook page showing a picture of him with Ginger and Richell recording what looked like an album together. It was confirmed on 30 July that they were indeed recording a new Chinese New Year Album and were asking for four males and females aged 18‚Äì26 to take place in their MV shooting on 13 August. This EP album Golden Princess Celebrate the New Year (ÂçÉÈáëÊÖ∂Êñ∞Âπ¥) contains 3 songs sung by Ginger and Richell and marks their final album ever released as Richell opened a ballet school.

Mainz am Rhein, 1997. Because his position in the 16th Dynasty is highly uncertain, it is not clear who were his predecessor and successor. Seneferankhre Pepi III is only attested by a scarab-shaped seal bearing his name. Egyptologist Kim Ryholt contests the seal as evidence that Pepi was a king of the 16th Dynasty, positing that the seal does not date to the Second Intermediate Period (SIP). According to Ryholt: \\"the size and design (prenomen + nomen without cartouche or royal titulary/epithets) of this seal is unparalleled during the SIP. Also the style of the signs is quite dissimilar to SIP seals.\\" Instead, Ryholt proposes that the seal of Seneferankhre Pepi III be dated to the First Intermediate Period, noting however that this is a very early date for a scarab seal,K.S.B.

Mainz am Rhein, 1997  Attestations The prenomen Nebmaatre is attested on a bronze axe-head discovered in a tomb at Mostagedda in Middle Egypt and now in the British Museum under the catalog number BM EA 63224. The same prenomen is inscribed on a black steatite amulet representing a lion of unknown provenance and now in the Petrie Museum under the catalog number 11587. A degree of uncertainty affects the ownership of these artifacts since Amenhotep III's prenomen was Nebmaatre as well. However, the axe-head can be dated to the late Second Intermediate Period based on stylistic grounds and provenance while according to Flinders Petrie the amulet is of too rough a workmanship to be attributable to Amenhotep III.Flinders Petrie: Scarabs and Cylinders with Names, 1978, Aris & Philips, Ltd. (reprint of the 1917 original edition published by BSAE). Instead Petrie suggested that the amulet be attributable to Ibi, an obscure ruler of the late 13th Dynasty whose prenomen is partially preserved in the Turin canon as \\"[...]maatre\\". However, Kim Ryholt's recent study of the Turin canon precludes this identification as a vertical stroke in the lacuna just prior to \\"maatre\\" rules out the hieroglyph for \\"neb\\". Chronological position The chronological position of Nebmaatre in the Second Intermediate Period is highly uncertain. The Egyptologist J√ºrgen von Beckerath proposes that Nebmaatre was a ruler of a compounded 15th‚Äì16th Dynasty, which he sees as an entirely Hyksos line of kings.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der agyptische Konigsnamen, Muncher. Agyptologische Studien, 49 Mainz, 1999, pp.118-119 Alternatively, Kim Ryholt put forth the hypothesis that Nebmaatre was a king of the 17th Dynasty, although he left his position in the dynasty unspecified. Kim Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C, Museum Tusculanum Press, (1997) Ryholt's datation is based on the observation that the axe-head bearing Nebmaatre's name was found in a tomb belonging to the Pan-grave culture.Manfred Bietak: the Pan-grave culture The Pan-grave people were Nubian mercenaries employed by rulers of the 17th Dynasty in their fight against the Hyksos foe.Darrell D.

Life  Murko was born in the small village of Drstelja near Ptuj, Lower Styria, in what was then the Austrian Empire and is now in Slovenia. He attended high school in Ptuj and Maribor. He studied Slavic and Germanic philology at the University of Vienna, where he was a pupil of Franz Miklosich. After obtaining his PhD in Vienna in 1886, he went to postdoctoral studies to Moscow. From 1897 to 1902, he taught Slavic philology at the University of Vienna, from 1902 to 1917 at the University of Graz, and from 1917 to 1920 at the University of Leipzig. From 1920 to 1931, he taught at Charles University in Prague, where he settled and lived until his death in 1952. At the Charles University he founded the Slavic Institute (Slovansk√Ω √∫stav), which he led until 1941. Murko had an intense social life and was a personal friend of figures as Ivan Hribar, Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk and Karel Kram√°≈ô.Slovenska kronika XIX. stoletja (1861‚Äì1899) (Ljubljana: Nova revija, 2005), p. 50 During his lifetime, he became a member of numerous academies of sciences around Europe, especially in Slavic countries: the Yugoslav, the Serbian, the Czech, the Soviet, the Bulgarian, the Polish and the Slovenian. He received a doctorate honoris causa from Charles University in Prague in 1909 and from the University of Ljubljana in 1951.  Work and influence  Murko was trained in the positivistic style of philology. He published several scientific works in the field of ethnology, cultural and literary history. Influenced by the historian Karl Lamprecht, Murko published the book Geschichte der aeltern slawischen Literaturen (\\"History of Ancient Slavic Literatures\\", Leipzig, 1908), in which he presented the older Slavic literatures as a reflection of their collective cultural and social life of those people. He also wrote on the history of Slovenian literature, especially on Pre≈°eren and Protestant authors from the 16th century, such as Primo≈æ Trubar, Jurij Dalmatin and Sebastijan Krelj. Since Murko published mostly in German and French, his work was little known to scholars unfamiliar with these languages, but it had an important influence on Milman Parry, who was studying for his doctorate at the Sorbonne in Paris under Antoine Meillet, at the time when Murko's major work appeared in French. His work was praised by the renowned Austrian critic Hermann Bahr, who regarded it as one of the finest examples of style in contemporary scientific prose. Murko also influenced the development of modern Slovenian literary history, especially Fran Ile≈°iƒç, Ivan Prijatelj, and France Kidriƒç.

It lies along Oregon Route 62 on the Rogue River, in the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 455.  History  Prospect began as a logging town; its first sawmill began operating in 1870. Prospect had a post office established in 1882 that was first named \\"Deskins\\" after the first postmaster. In 1888, there was a mill named Deskins Sawmill. The name of the community was changed to \\"Prospect\\" in 1889 because of plans made to run a railroad up the Rogue River, which would ostensibly improve the community's prospects. The Prospect Hotel, which opened in 1892, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  Local events and sites of interest On the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, Prospect holds the Mill Creek Memorial festival. It honors veterans with a parade, a flag retirement ceremony, live music and games for children. All the proceeds go to a fund to help veterans. In July Prospect hosts an airplane \\"fly-in\\" that helps support the Jackson County Search and Rescue, and in August a jamboree and timber carnival (a festival that includes lumberjack contests such as log rolling) are held. On the last weekend in September, Prospect hosts Music in the Mountains, a two- day festival of bluegrass, country, folk and Americana music on the grounds of the Prospect Hotel. Prospect is the site of Prospect State Airport. The Prospect State Scenic Viewpoint is nearby.

Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Tomney found himself jobless during the Great Depression and walked to London in search of employment. After arriving in London he moved into the Rowton House in Hammersmith, a hostel for working men. This was to be the beginning of a long association with that area of west London. Tomney obtained work as a night-watchman in a glass blowing factory, and became an active trade unionist. From 1940 he was branch secretary of the General and Municipal Workers Union. With an approaching general election in 1950, the Labour Party found itself without a candidate at Hammersmith North. The sitting member of parliament, D. N. Pritt, had been expelled from the party and had won the seat in 1945 as a member of the left- wing Labour Independent Group. Tomney volunteered to stand, and was comfortably elected with a majority of nearly 3,000 votes over Pritt. He was re-elected at each election until he stood down in 1979, and was seen as being on the right wing of the Labour Party, a fact that was often to lead to conflict within the constituency party in Hammersmith North. In 1976 Tomney was deselected by his constituency party. This was partly a result of his having right-wing views on homesexuality, race and capital punishment which one party official described as being closer to the policies of the National Front. Tomney took an interest in European and international affairs, and was a delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union on a number of occasions between 1963 and 1979. In 1968 he was leader of the United Kingdom delegation to the United Nations, and from 1976-77 was a Member of the European Parliament. He was opposed to sanctions against Rhodesia. He lived in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, and was a member of Watford Town Council from 1946‚Äì50 and of Hertfordshire County Council from 1950‚Äì54. Tomney retired from the House of Commons in 1979. He died aged 76 in Hillingdon Hospital.

It is the third church built on the same site in the course of time.  History  The first church on this site was built in 1237 by the newly arrived Dominicans on a parcel of land allotted in 1225-1226 by the duke Leopold VI. The church was enlarged between 1240‚Äì1270 and a new choir was added in 1273. A series of fires caused the construction of a new Gothic church between 1283 and 1302. The nave was extended between 1458 and 1474. This church consisted of a nave with five cross vaults, and two aisles. This church was heavily damaged during the first siege of Vienna by the Turkish army in 1529. The choir was demolished and the nave was partly taken down. The building became more and more dilapidated during the next period. The new- found self-awareness of the Counter-Reformation didn‚Äôt allow any more such a sorry state for a church. In 1631 the Dominicans started to build a new oblong church with a dome, following the plan of Jacopo Tencala, architect of Prince Maximilian of Liechtenstein. The master builders were Jacopo Spacio, Cipriano Biasino and Antonio Canevale. They introduced to Vienna the Baroque style of Italy. The first stone was laid by emperor Ferdinand II on 29 May 1631. The structural work was finished in 1634. The church was consecrated on 1 October 1634. The finishing touch was finally given in 1674. The church was elevated to the status of basilica minor in 1927 under the name ‚ÄúRosary Basilica ad S. Mariam Rotundam‚Äù.  Facade  Fa√ßade The impressive facade was built in the Roman-Lombardic style with dominant columns, supporting the cornice. Its architecture goes back to early Baroque churches in Rome, that in turn, rely on the facade of the Dominican church Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Above the portal one can see the statues of St. Catherine of Siena and Agnes of Montepulciano, kneeling at the feet of Our Lady, patron saint of this church. On both sides of the portal there are niches with (on the left) the statue of Ludwig Bertrand and (on the right) Saint Rose of Lima. On top of the facade is a large rectangular gable with a dormer window, crowned by a pediment.  Interior  The church consists of a long central nave, flanked by three side chapels on each side, a transept, a choir and an apse. The nave is approximately 25 m long, 14 m wide, and 22.10 m high. The large dome reaches a height of 23.80 m. Above each side chapel is gallery with a shallow balcony.  Frescoes  Frescoes of Matthias Rauchmiller The ornate interior is imposing by its architecture and the exquisite stucco in the decorations. Semi-circular windows allow a soft light on the frescoes of the barrel-vaulted ceiling. The ceiling frescoes are the work of Matthias Rauchmiller (1675), showing in their color and composition the influence of Peter Paul Rubens. They depict in 46 scenes the life of Our Lady. The influential painter Carpoforo Tencalla decorated at the same time the apse around the main altar with two historic paintings of Christian victories, ascribed to power of the Rosary : the Battle of Muret (1213) and the Battle of Lepanto (1571). Tencala also added some paintings on the walls of the side chapels. The fresco in the dome replaced an earlier work by Nikolaus van Hoy (1674) when the new dome was built in 1820. The fresco dates from 1836 and is by Franz Geyling. It shows Our Lady and Child under the golden light of the Trinity, surrounded by kneeling Angels. The medallions in the four supporting columns are by an unknown artist, depicting three popes from the Dominican Order (Innocent V, Benedict XI and Pius V) and St. Antony of Florence. The large statues in these columns show us the four original Doctors of the Church (Jerome, Gregory the Great, Augustine and Ambrose), all sculpted by a local artist.  Main altar  Main altar The apse is dominated by the imposing red-marbled wooden retable in Baroque style from 1839-1840 by Carl Roesner, replacing the dilapidated old altarpiece. It surrounds the large canvas (720 cm x 430 cm) by Leopold Kuppelwieser (1840), flanked by red Corinthian columns. It depicts the establishment by Pope Pius V of the Feast of the Rosary. The tabernacle dates from 1885 and is made of gilded brass.  Pulpit  Pulpit The gilded pulpit dates from 1700 and was made by Matthias Steinl. It was modeled on an engraving by Jean le Pautre (1618‚Äì1682), that now can be seen at the Martin von Wagner Museum in W√ºrzburg, Germany. The antependium shows a blue globe surrounded by a rosary and below, in the medaillon, the motto \\"toto diffunditur orbe\\" (spread all over the world). On the canopy of the pulpit the Holy Spirit, represented in the form of a dove, is surrounded by a halo of light and angels in elegant poses.  Transept chapels  Altar of Saint Dominic : painting by Tobias Pock (1655), depicting the saint adoring the Trinity. The statue on the predella is a copy of the True image of St. Dominic in the pilgrimage church of Soriano, Calabria, Southern Italy. The niches contain the statues of (below) St. Leopold and St. Florian, and (above) St. Catherine of Alexandria and St. Barbara. Archduchess Claudia Felicitas, second wife of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, was buried at the age of 22 in the crypt of this chapel. She died on 2 September 1676. * Altar of John of Nepomuk, situated against the pillar of the crossing. The painting is by an unknown master. The four statues (Antony of Padua, Vincent Ferrer, the apostle Peter, and Severin von Noricum) were sculpted by Lorenzo Mattielli in 1724. At the top of the volutes, resting on the capitals of double columns flanking the statues, he added female figures, allegories of Faith and Hope.  Side chapels  Side chapel of Vincent Ferrer; painting by Fran√ßois Roettiers Each of the six chapels is dedicated to a saint, portrayed in the painting above the altar. The altars are the rather unpretentious work of workshops. The figures are of diverse quality. *Chapel of St. Catherine of Siena : situated next to the pulpit. The painting, ascribed to Fran√ßois Roettiers (1685‚Äì1742), depicts the Mythical wedding of the saint with Christ. The paintings on the side walls are by the same artist. *Chapel of Thomas Aquinas : The paintings of the altarpiece and the side walls are by the Flemish painter Frans Leuyx (1638 and 1649‚Äì1650) *Chapel of Saint Rose of Lima : the original altarpiece of this Dominican saint by an anonymous master (1671) was replaced in the second half of the 18th century by a Coronation of Our Lady * Chapel of Saint Anne (mother of Mary) : the altarpiece with St. Anna, St. John the Baptist and St. Barbara has a long time wrongly been ascribed to Tobias Pock * Chapel of St. Vincent Ferrer : . The magnificent paintings are again by Fran√ßois Roettiers. The altarpiece (1726) shows the saint bringing back to life a dead person. The angels with trumpets above the painting refer to the mission of this preacher of penitence. The high-quality bronzed statues of St. Jerome and Mary Magdalen were produced by the workshop of Johann-Georg Bendl. The gilded wrought-iron fencing of the chapel is the work of the monks Martin Eker and Raymund Schrob. *Chapel of St. Catherine of Alexandria : The altarpiece is by Tobias Pock, depicting realistically the martyrdom of the saint. The side walls were painted by Frans Leuyx  The organ  Organ The main body of the organ was made in two parts at about 1750 according to the traditions of the Vienna organ builders of that time. The gilded concave-convex balustrade of the rood loft is a typical example of the transition between Baroque and Rococo. The organ with 34 registers dates from 1895‚Äì1896 and was renovated in 1991. The painting under the rood loft is by an anonymous master from 1642 and depicts the glorification of the rosary and the mediation via Saint Dominic.

One feature of the book believed to be miraculous is the expressiveness of its verses, as it is claimed they are too eloquent to be written by a human. Another is the amount of scientific information believed to be in the Quran that was not known in the 7th century when the Quran was revealed, which is said to prove that the Quran's origin must be divine. As expected, such arguments are not accepted by non-believers and even many Muslims consider this sort of rhetoric to be extravagant. Scientific miracles Several verses in the Qur'an are believed to describe miracles  the splitting of the moon, and assistance of angels given to Muslims at the Battle of Badr. According to the theory of \\"scientific miracles in the Quran\\", the Quran abounds with scientific facts which appeared centuries before their discovery by science. This demonstrates according to supporters that the Quran must be of divine origin. Among these miracles said to be found in the Quran are \\"everything, from relativity, quantum mechanics, Big Bang theory, black holes and pulsars, genetics, embryology, modern geology, thermodynamics, even the laser and hydrogen fuel cells\\". The \\"themes and emphases\\" of this \\"scientific exegesis\\" of the Quran began in the 1970s and 80s as a \\"popular literature known as ijaz\\" (miracle) and spread to Muslim bookstores, websites, and on television programs of Islamic preachers (according to critics). The ijaz movement/industry is \\"widespread and well- funded\\"Cook, The Koran, 2000: p.29 with \\"millions\\" from Saudi Arabia. =Criticism= As of 2008, both (some) Muslims and non-Muslims have disputed whether there actually are scientific miracles in the Quran. According to author Ziauddin Sardar, the movement has created a \\"global craze in Muslim societies\\". Critics argue that while it is generally agreed the Quran contains many verses proclaiming the wonders of nature ‚Äî such as ‚ÄúTravel throughout the earth and see how He brings life into being‚Äù (Q.29:20), ‚ÄúBehold in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding ...‚Äù (Q.3:190) ‚Äî The ijaz movement is questionable because *it requires \\"considerable mental gymnastics and distortions to find scientific facts or theories in these verses\\" (Ziauddin Sardar); *the Quran is the source of guidance in right faith (iman) and righteous action (alladhina amanu wa amilu l-salihat), but the idea that it contained \\"all knowledge, including scientific\\" knowledge has not been a mainstream view among Muslim scholarship (Zafar Ishaq Ansari); and *\\"Science is ever-changing\\", the Copernican revolution overturned Ptolemy's models of the universe, Einstein‚Äôs general relativity overshadowed Newtonian mechanics, (Ali Talib). Prophecies and claimed fulfillment Throughout the Qur'an, claims or predictions are made concerning future events. Many of the prophecies are viewed as having metaphoric meanings, while others are taken more literally. As the Qur'an is said to contain the exact words of God which were revealed to Muhammad in Arabic and later transcribed, the meaning of the Qur'an has a great effect on Muslim beliefs and understanding. Some prophecies are debated more than others as to whether or not they were actually fulfilled or how the Qur'anic text should be interpreted. One of the more general prophecies is that the Qur'an predicts its own preservation and endurance. The Qur'an states that the book itself will survive as a valid source and that the religion of Islam will last, even dominate, because of this.> Muslim scholars say that today's Qur'an is the same Qur'an originally compiled by Muhammad, and that the memorisation ensures the consistency and its preservation.See: *William Montgomery Watt in The Cambridge History of Islam, p.32 *Richard Bell, William Montgomery Watt, 'introduction to the Qur ºƒÅn', p.51 *F. E. Peters (1991), pp.3‚Äì5: ‚ÄúFew have failed to be convinced that ‚Ä¶ the Quran is ‚Ä¶ the words of Muhammad, perhaps even dictated by him after their recitation.‚Äù The following passages from the Qur'an state these prophecies: ‚ÄúWe have, without doubt, Sent down the Message; And We will assuredly Guard it (from corruption)‚Äù (15:9). ‚ÄúIt is Allah Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance And the ideology of Truth, to make it superior over all other ways of life, Even though the disbelievers May hate (it)‚Äù (61:9). Another interpretation of the Qur'an is that it predicted the defeat of the Persians by the Romans. Before the prophecy, at the Battle of Antioch, in 613 C.E., the Persians defeated the Romans. Muslims were upset by this defeat because they felt more connected to Rome, a Christian empire, than to Persia, a Zoroastrian one. The following verse is however included in the Qur'an: \\"The Roman Empire Has been defeated ‚Äì In a land close by; But they, (even) after (This) defeat of theirs, Will soon be victorious ‚Äì Within a few years. With God is the Decision, In the Past And in the Future: On that Day shall The Believers rejoice‚Äù (30:2-4). By 627 C.E., the Romans had successfully defeated the Persians, resulting in much celebration by Muslims and allegedly fulfilling a prophecy of the Qur'an. The Qu'ran says ‚ÄúAnd We have indeed Made the Qur-an easy to understand and remember: Then is there any that Will receive admonition?‚Äù (54:17) That memorisation is indeed possible has been said to be a miraculous fulfilment of a prophecy. The Qur'an‚Äôs ‚Äúrhythmic style and eloquent expression‚Äù have been cited as aids in verbatim memorization. The Qur'an states that God says to the Pharaoh of the Exodus: \\"This day shall We save thee in thy body, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee.\\" The body of the Pharaoh, who was argued to be either Ramesses II or his son Merneptah, had been thought to be lost at sea until the mummies of both were discovered in the 19th century, and put on display in Cairo's Egyptian Museum; it is argued that the prophecy that the Pharaoh's body would be preserved has been fulfilled. Literary quality According to Ali Dashti, \\"there has been much debate, however, on the question whether the Qur‚Äôan is miraculous in respect of its eloquence or of its subject-matter, or of both. In general the Muslim scholars consider it to be miraculous in both respects.\\"Dashti, 23 Years, 1994: p.40 =Scriptural basis= Verses of the Qur'an stating that the Qu'ran itself is a miracle ‚Äì i.e. so amazing it could not have been a natural occurrence ‚Äì include: * Or they say, \\"He (Prophet Muhammad(P)) forged it (the Qur'an).\\" Say: \\"Bring you then ten forged surah (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!\\", was revealed in response to polytheists accusation that Muhammad's revelation was invented by Muhammad or came from other men.Dashti, 23 Years, 1994: p.40 * Say: \\"If the mankind and the jinns were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.\\" was issued in reply to an accusation found in * 'We have already heard (such things). If we wished, we could say (things) like this. These are only fables of the ancients'\\" Other verses challenging pagans to produce verses as wonderful as the revelations produced by Muhammad and thus suggesting the Quran miraculousness include: *And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our final Messenger (Muhammad Peace be upon him ), then produce a surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful. *Or they say, \\"He (Prophet Muhammad(P)) forged it (the Qur'an).\\" Say: \\"Bring you then ten forged surah (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!\\" * - Or do they say: \\"He (Muhammad(P)) has forged it?\\" Say: \\"Bring then a surah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can, besides Allah, if you are truthful!\\" * - Or do they say: \\"He (Muhammad(P)) has forged it (this Qur'an)?\\" Nay! They believe not! Let them then produce a recital like unto it (the Qur'an) if they are truthful. (all English translations by Hilali and Muhsin Khan) The Quran describes Muhammad as \\"ummi\\",Quran which is traditionally interpreted as \\"unlettered,\\"Dashti, 23 Years, 1994: p.44 and the ability of such a person to produce the Quran is taken as miraculousDashti, 23 Years, 1994: p.44 and as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as Watt prefer the second meaning. However, some scholars argue that the word did not mean \\"illiterate\\" but a non-Jewish and non-Christian Arabs pagan Arabs.

Paio Peres Correia was a Portuguese warrior who played an important role in the thirteenth-century Reconquista. He was born c. 1205, in Monte de Fral√£es, a civil parish in the municipality of Barcelos. He went to Ucl√©s, then the seat of the Order of Santiago, very young. His career path took him back to Portugal, where he became comendador of Alc√°cer, i.e. the leader of the Portuguese knight-friars of Santiago, in 1232. In close collaboration with Sancho II of Portugal, the knight-friars conducted several campaigns against the Moors in the region of Alentejo. These events are ill-documented, but it seems that the initial focus was on the castle of Aljustrel, which fell before March 1235. Form there he fortified a hill in Padr√µes and manned it with 40 knights which ravaged the defences of M√©rtola, a stronghold of real strategic importance as it gave access to the mouth of the Guadiana. Eventually, M√©rtola fell to the knights-friar which were under the command of his cousin Martim Eanes do Vinhal. He then went southwards to the Algarve conquering Cacela and Tavira. In 1242, in M√©rida he became Grand-Master of the military Order of Santiago until the rest of his life. As such, he became an asset in the reconquering efforts of Ferdinand III of Castile. He guided his son, the prince of Castile, the future Alfonso X, in the conquest of Murcia. According to the Cr√≥nica da Conquista do Algarve, during the reign of Afonso III of Portugal, he is said to have returned to Algarve, where he took part in the capture of Faro in 1249, thus completing the Portuguese conquest of the last part of the Algarve still in Moorish hands. D. Paio Peres Correia is remembered in the place-names and street names in many cities and towns in Portugal as Lisbon, Set√∫bal, Silves, and Tavira, and in Spain as Seville (Triana quarter). In Portugal, the parish of Aldeia de Paio Pires, in Seixal, and the town of Samora Correia in Benavente claim to be named after him, although there is no evidence for this.

The village is about east of Banbury in Oxfordshire and about west- northwest of Brackley. The A422 road between Banbury and Brackley used to pass through Middleton Cheney, but now bypasses it to the south. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population (including Thenford) as 3,597. Archaeology and history Traces of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Roman settlements have been found in the parish. An open field system of farming prevailed in the parish until the 18th century. Parliament passed an Inclosure Act for the parish in 1769 and the parish was surveyed for its inclosure awards in 1770. There is a row of 19th-century almshouses on the former main road through the village. In 1847 Parliament passed a bill for the Buckinghamshire Railway to build an extension to Banbury. It was built through the south of Middleton Cheney parish, and Farthinghoe railway station was opened in the parish in 1851. It was in the southeast corner of the parish, from the village, on the main road to Brackley. British Railways closed the station in 1952 and the railway in 1963. The Holt was a house in the parish designed by William Wilkinson. It built in 1864 and demolished in 1973. The parish used to include the village of Overthorpe, which is now a separate parish. Churches =Church of England= The Church of England parish church of All Saints is early 14th- century Decorated Gothic. The windows have been renewed but the south doorway is original. The nave has a clerestory, north and south aisles and four-bay arcades. William Edington was Rector 1322‚Äì35. He was consecrated Bishop of Winchester in 1345. The west tower and spire are later Medieval Perpendicular Gothic additions. The top of the spire is about above ground. In the 18th century the spire survived three lightning strikes: in 1720, 1794 and 1797. All Saints was restored under the direction of George Gilbert Scott in 1865. During the restoration notable stained-glass windows were added that were designed by the Pre-Raphaelite artists William Morris, Philip Webb, Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown and Simeon Solomon and made by Morris & Co. There are also mosaics made by James Powell and Sons, one of which was designed by Henry Holiday. All Saints is now a Grade I listed building. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Henry I Bagley of Chacombe cast four of them: the tenor in 1640, the second bell in 1659, the treble in 1671 and the third bell in 1680. James Keene, who had bell-foundries at Bedford and Woodstock, cast the fifth bell in 1651. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the fourth bell in 1881. Horton family mausoleum, designed by William Wilkinson and made by Thomas Earp in 1866‚Äì67 All Saints' churchyard has a number of historic grave monuments. Four 17th-century English Baroque headstones and two 18th-century chest tombs are Grade II listed. The Horton family mausoleum is not listed, but is a Gothic Revival nomument designed by William Wilkinson and made by Thomas Earp in 1866‚Äì67.

Vice-Admiral Holland Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland (1887‚Äì1941) was born in Middleton Cheney. He joined the Royal Navy in 1902 and spent the First World War as a gunnery instructor at HMS Excellent. By 1934 he was a rear admiral, and in 1937 he was aide-de-camp to King George VI. In the Second World War, Holland commanded the 7th Cruiser Squadron at the Battle of Cape Spartivento in November 1940. In May 1941 he commanded the Battlecruiser Squadron when it engaged the in the Battle of Denmark Strait. The magazine of Holland's flagship exploded, breaking her in two and sinking her. Holland was killed, along with all but three of Hoods company. The Admiral Holland pub in Bretch Hill, Banbury, was named after him. The pub was demolished in 2017.

His royal name Seuserenre translates as \\"The one whom Re has caused to be strong.\\"Khiyan Titulary Khyan bears the titles of an Egyptian king, but also the title ruler of the foreign land (heqa-khaset). The later title is the typical designation of the Hyksos rulers. Khyan is one of the better attested kings from the Hyksos period, known from many seals and seal impressions. Remarkable are objects with his name found at Knossos and Hattusha indicating diplomatic contacts with Crete and the Hittites. A sphinx with his name was bought on the art market at Baghdad and might demonstrate diplomatic contacts to Babylon, in an example of Egypt-Mesopotamia relations. The remains of a palace were recently excavated at Avaris. Seal impressions of Khyan were found there, indicating that this was his palace.M. Bietak: A Hyksos Palace at Avaris, In: Egyptian Archaeology 38 Spring 2011, S. 38-41 Khyan's position in the Hyksos dynasty Scarab of KhyanFlinders Petrie: Scarabs and cylinders with names (1917), available copyright-free here, pl. XXI Scarab of \\"Khyan the Hyksos\\" (\\"Hyksos\\" highlighted) Khyan is identified with king Iannas in the works of Josephus whose knowledge of the Hyksos Pharaohs was derived from a history of Egypt written by Manetho. Josephus mentions him after Apophis when discussing the reign lengths of kings who ruled after Salitis. This led 18th century scholars such as Arthur Bedford to place Khyan after Apophis, towards the end of the Hyksos dynasty. However, in Sextus Julius Africanus' version of Manetho's Epitome, Khyan (whose name is transcribed there as Staan) is listed after a king Pachnan, perhaps Yaqub-Har. Stylistically Khyan's scarabs resemble closely those of Yaqub-Har, who might date rather to the beginning and not to the end of the Hyksos-period.W. Ward, in; O. Tufnell: Scarabs and their Contribution to History in the Early Second Millennium B.C., Warminster 1984, 68, fig. 29A scarab of Khyan at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This indicates that Khyan was one of the earlier rulers of the 15th dynasty. The early position of Khyan within the 15th dynasty may be confirmed by new archaeological finds at Edfu. On this site were found seal impressions of Khyan in close connection with seal impressions of the 13th Dynasty king Sobekhotep IV, indicating that both kings could have reigned at about the same time.N. Moeller, G. Marouard, N. Ayers: Discussion of Late Middle Kingdom and Early Second Intermediate Period History and Chronology in Relation to the Khayan Sealings from Tell Edfu, in: √Ñgypten und Levante XXI (2011), 87-121 online PDF The scholars Moeller and Marouard discuss the discovery of an important early 12th dynasty Middle Kingdom administrative building in the eastern Tell Edfu area which was continuously employed into the early Second Intermediate Period before it fell out of use during the 17th dynasty when its remains were sealed by a large silo court. Fieldwork by Egyptologists in 2010 and 2011 into the remains of the former 12th dynasty building which was also used in the 13th dynasty led to the discovery of a large adjoining hall which proved to contain 41 sealings showing the cartouche of the Hyksos ruler Khyan together with 9 sealings naming the 13th dynasty king Sobekhotep IV. As Moeller and Marouard write: \\"These finds come from a secure and sealed archaeological context and open up new questions about the cultural and chronological evolution of the late Middle Kingdom and early Second Intermediate Period.\\"N. Moeller, G. Maround, N. Ayers, √Ñgypten und Levante XXI (2011), p.87 These conclusions are rejected by Robert Porter who argues that Khyan ruled much later than Sobekhotep IV and that the seals of a pharaoh were used even long after his death. Another option he proposed is that Sobekhotep IV reigned much later than previously thought.Robert M.

Manfred Bietak observed that: \\"a stela set up in Avaris contains the nomen and prenomen of Khyan and a now lost dedication (presumably to Seth, Lord of Avaris) below which are inscribed the title and name of the Eldest King's Son Yanassi.\\" Manfred Bietak, MDAIK 37, pp.63-71, pl.6Kim SB Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, CNI Publications, (Museum Tusculanum Press: 1997), p.256 The Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt, who published an extensive catalogue of the monuments of all the numerous pharaohs of the Second Intermediate Period, notes an important personal detail regarding this king's family; Ryholt writes that the association of Khyan with those of his eldest son upon this stela suggests that Yanassi in fact was his designated successor, as also implied by his title.\\" Ryholt speculates that Manetho might have mentioned Yanassi in a now lost passage and that one possible explanation of the name Iannas used by Josephus for Khyan is a misquotation of such a passage in which the son's name was extracted instead of the father's. Origin of Khyan's name Ryholt notes that the name, Khyan, generally has been \\"interpreted as Amorite Hayanu (reading h-ya-a-n) which the Egyptian form represents perfectly, and this is in all likelihood the correct interpretation.\\" Ryholt, p.128 It should be stressed that Khyan's name was not original and had been in use for centuries before the fifteenth (Hyksos) Dynasty.

Biography =Early career= Born to a farming family in rural Akaiwa District, Okayama (now part of Okayama city, Okayama prefecture), Ugaki graduated from the 40th class Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1912. He placed 9th out of 144 cadets, and served as midshipman on the cruisers and . He was commissioned as ensign on 1 December 1913 and was assigned to the battlecruiser . He subsequently served on the battlecruiser , cruiser and destroyer . After his promotion to lieutenant on 1 December 1918, he attended naval artillery school, and was assigned as chief gunnery officer to the destroyer . In 1924, Ugaki graduated from the 22nd class of the Naval Staff College, and was promoted to lieutenant commander. After a brief posting aboard the cruiser , he served three years as a staff member of the Naval Gunnery School, and was then appointed as a resident officer in Germany from 1928‚Äì1930, with the rank of commander. After his promotion to captain on 1 December 1932, Ugaki served as an instructor at the Naval Staff College. In 1935, Ugaki was assigned as a staff officer to the Combined Fleet for a year before he was given his first command: the cruiser . The following year, he was given command of battleship . =World War II= Yamamoto (left) and Ugaki Ugaki became rear admiral on 15 November 1938. In August 1941, just prior to Japan‚Ä≤s attack on European/US interests in the Pacific Theater, (some consider the 2nd Sino-Japanese war to be the real start of World War II), Ugaki was appointed Chief-of-Staff of the Combined Fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto in which he served until Yamamoto's death. He was promoted to vice admiral on 1 November 1942. Traveling with Yamamoto in a separate Mitsubishi G4M bomber, both aircraft were shot down on 18 April 1943 over Bougainville in the Solomon Islands, in what the United States named \\"Operation Vengeance\\". Yamamoto‚Ä≤s aircraft crashed in the jungle, while Ugaki‚Ä≤s fell into the sea at high speed. He was one of three survivors, the others being the bomber's pilot Hayashi and another staff officer, Kitamura. After he recovered from his wounds, in February 1944 Ugaki was placed in command of the 1st Battleship Division (, , ), and was commander during the disastrous Battle of Leyte Gulf, including the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October, and Battle off Samar on 25 October 1944. Despite the tremendous potential firepower of these three vessels, the largest in the Imperial Navy, only modest damage was inflicted on the American forces, and from the fall of 1944 to the summer of 1945 all three ships would be severely damaged by overwhelming strikes by U.S. carrier-based planes. Recalled to Japan in February 1945, Ugaki was appointed commander of IJN Fifth Air Fleet based in Ky≈´sh≈´ and overseeing all naval aircraft in the region from his headquarters in a cave bunker to protect him from the growing threat of B-29 Superfortress attacks. In March, he launched a long-range strike of kamikaze against the U.S. fleet anchored at Ulithi followed by the first waves of Operation Ten-Go in April, which involved hundreds of kamikaze attacks against U.S. Navy ships in the vicinity of Okinawa. Though such air attacks throughout this campaign caused fearsome superficial damage and crew casualties to a great number of Allied vessels, no Pacific Fleet surface warships larger than a destroyer were sunk directly by this method during the spring of 1945. Meanwhile, he gathered even more aircraft and hid them to be used in the same fashion in defense of Ky≈´sh≈´ against the expected Allied invasion that was sure to come. Ugaki planned to hit the invasion forces with hundreds of aircraft and suicide boats in a few hours in Operation Ketsu-Go (Decisive Operation).Ugaki, Fading Victory =Final mission= Admiral Ugaki before his final kamikaze mission On 15 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito made a radio announcement conceding defeat and calling for the military to lay down their arms. After listening to the announcement of Japan's defeat, Ugaki made a last entry in his diary noting that he had not yet received an official cease-fire order, and that as he alone was to blame for the failure of his valiant aviators to stop the enemy, he would fly one last mission himself to show the true spirit of bushido. His subordinates protested, and even after Ugaki had climbed into the backseat of a Yokosuka D4Y, Warrant Officer Akiyoshi Endo‚Äîwhose place in the kamikaze roster Ugaki had usurped‚Äîclimbed into the same space that the admiral had already occupied. Thus, the aircraft containing Ugaki took off with three men, as opposed to two each in the remaining ten aircraft. Prior to boarding his aircraft, Ugaki posed for pictures and removed his rank insignia from his dark green uniform, taking only a ceremonial short sword given to him by Admiral Yamamoto.Hoyt, The Last Kamikaze Elements of this last flight most likely followed the Ryukyu flyway southwest to the many small islands north of Okinawa, where U.S. forces were still on alert at the potential end of hostilities. Endo served as radioman during the mission, sending Ugaki's final messages, the last of which at 19:24 reported that the plane had begun its dive onto an American vessel. However, U.S. Navy records do not indicate any successful kamikaze attack on that day, and it is likely that all aircraft on the mission (with the exception of three that returned due to engine problems) crashed into the ocean, struck down by American anti-aircraft fire. Although there are no precise accounts of an intercept made by Navy or Marine fighters or Pacific Fleet surface units against enemy aircraft in this vicinity at the time of surrender, it is possible further research may reveal more detail as to which ships (if any) were attacked. The next morning, the crew of American landing craft LST-926 claimed to have found the still smoldering remains of a 'cockpit' (implying a shootdown or violent ditching of some sort, but not the exact cause) with three bodies on the beach of Iheyajima Island. The third man, his head crushed and right arm missing, wore a dark green uniform and a short sword was found nearby. The sailors buried the bodies in the sand. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.

Sterolin-1 and ‚Äì2 are two ‚Äòhalf‚Äô adenosine triphosphate binding (ATP) cassette (ABC) transporters which found to be indispensable for the regulation of sterol absorption and excretion. Mutations in either genes result in a lipid disorder, sitosterolemia.  Locus of the genes  The molecular mechanisms regulating the absorption of dietary sterols in the body are poorly understood, and as sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessively inherited lipid metabolic disorder characterized by hyperabsorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols, studies have focused on the molecular basis of sitosterolemia to shed light on important principles concerning intestinal sterol absorption as well as cholesterol secretion into bile. In 1998, sitosterolemia (STSL) locus has been mapped to the short arm of human chromosome 2 (2p21) after studying 10 well-characterized families with this disorder. Subsequently, the STSL locus has been further localized to a less than 2 centimorgans (cM) region. In 2001, The STSL locus was found to be comprises two genes, ABCG5 and ABCG8, encoding 2 members of the ABC- transporter family, named sterolin-1 and sterolin-2, respectively, Sterolin-2, discovered after sterolin-1, is located <400 base pair (bp) upstream of sterolin-1 in the opposite orientation.  Structure of the encoded proteins  Typical ABC transporter consists of two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains. However, the ABCG or White subfamily with its five fully characterized human members consists of half-size ABC proteins which probably dimerize to form active membrane transporters. In our case, it is suggested that ABCG5 and ABCG8 form a heterodimer . Among the half-size molecules, ABCG proteins have a peculiar domain organization characterized by a nucleotide-binding domain at the N-terminus followed by six transmembrane- spanning domains.  Function  Under normal circumstances, a western diet contains almost equal amounts of cholesterol and noncholesterol sterols (such as plant sterols sitosterol, campesterol, and brassicasterol). However, only about 55% of total dietary cholesterol is absorbed and retained while almost none of the noncholesterol sterols are retained since the small amount of dietary non-cholesterols that do enter the body are rapidly excreted by the liver into bile, almost unchanged. Sterolins are likely involved both in the selective transport of dietary cholesterol in and out of enterocytes and in selective sterol excretion by the liver into bile, as evidenced by the consequences when it is deficient or over expressed. The exact mechanism(s) whereby ABCG5/ABCG8 exert their effects on sterol metabolism has not yet been clarified. But it is suggested that the ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimer shuttles cholesterol from the inner leaflet of the canalicular membrane through a chamber formed by the two half-transporters. Following ATP binding and hydrolysis, the complex undergoes a conformational change, flipping a cholesterol molecule into the outer membrane leaflet in a configuration that favors its release into the canalicular space. Based on the clinical defects in sitosterolemia, ABCG5/ABCG8 are expressed in the liver and/or the intestine. 5 These genes respond to environmental dietary sterols, although whether they are also increased by high phytosterols has yet to be determined. It is worth to mention that other gene products play a role in dietary- cholesterol transport (such as ABCA1).  Disorders involving ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes  Mutations in both alleles of either ABCG5 or ABCG8 in the human results in sitosterolemia. Sitosterolemia (also known as phytosterolemia) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited lipid metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of tendon xanthomas, premature coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic disease, hemolytic episodes, arthralgias and arthritis. The hallmark of sitosterolemia is diagnostically elevated levels of plant sterols in the plasma.  References  Lee M, Lu K, Patel S B. Genetic basis of sitosterolemia. Curr. Opin.

Biography Salitis is mainly known from a few passages of Flavius Josephus' work Contra Apionem; for these passages, Josephus claimed to have reported Manetho's original words. It seems that during the reign of an Egyptian pharaoh called Tutimaios or Timaios, an army of foreigners suddenly came from the Near East and took over the Nile Delta without a fight. After conquering Memphis and likely deposing Tutimaios, the invaders committed several atrocities such as destroying cities and temples and killing or capturing the native Egyptians. After that, they : > made one of their number, whose name was Salitis, king. He resided in > Memphis and exacted tribute from both the upper and lower country, leaving > fortresses in the most strategic places. Salitis was determined to hold down his new conquests. For this reason he fortified the eastern borders, and sought a strategic position to establish an imposing stronghold from which he could dominate the independent-minded Upper Egyptians. Having found it in the city of Avaris on the east bank of the Bubastite branch of the Nile, Salitis : > established this city and rendered it extremely secure with walls, settling > there a large body of armed troops ‚Äì as many as 240,000 men ‚Äì as a frontier > guard. He used to go there in the summer, partly to hand out rations and > distribute pay, and partly to train them carefully in military exercises, to > frighten foreigners. Salitis died after 19 years of rule and his throne passed to another Asiatic called Bnon or Beon. Identification Several attempts were made to identify Salitis with an archaeologically attested ruler. He was sometimes associated with a ruler named Sharek or Shalek ‚Äì who is mentioned in a genealogical priestly document from Memphis ‚Äì and also with the much more attested king Sheshi. p. 185 German Egyptologist J√ºrgen von Beckerath believed that Salitis could be associated with Yakbim, another Second Intermediate Period ruler.Salitis' page on eglyphica.de At the current state of knowledge, Salitis remains unidentified. 76-77, n.71 Even for his name there are no clues of what it could have originally meant in Egyptian, though the variant Saites used by Sextus Julius Africanus in his epitome of Manetho, might contain a reference to the deltaic city of Sais. It has been suggested that the name might be linked to shallit, a title borne by the biblical patriarch Joseph during his stay in Egypt () with the meaning of \\"keeper of the power\\"; however, this is also considered a very weak assumption. p. 107 As for him, also the identification of his Egyptian predecessor Tutimaios and Asiatic successor Bnon were a matter of debate; though the former was tentatively identified with Djedneferre Dedumose of the vaning 13th Dynasty; this identification was questioned for being rather weak.

It is situated in St Helen's Square, where York's Coney Street and Lendal intersect in the city centre. It is built in an early Georgian style. The Mansion House is the earliest purpose built house for a Lord Mayor still in existence and predates the Mansion House in London by at least twenty years. The foundation stone for the Mansion House was laid in 1725, with the building being completed seven years later in 1732. The architect who designed the Mansion House is unknown, although the frontage may be by William Etty. History In 1998 the house was restored by the York Civic Trust. In October 2015 the Mansion House was closed for refurbishment as part of the \\"Opening Doors\\" Heritage Lottery Fund refurbishment and reopened in 2017.

Bowes was born in York and was christened in St. Cuthbert's, York, where many of his family were also buried. In the sixteenth century there was a move to reduce the number of parish churches in York and Bowes pleaded to the council to save St. Cuthbert's.

In 1416 Sigismund was installed as a Knight of the Order of the Garter of the Knights of St. George as part of Henry V's alliance against France. He sent a sword to be hung over his stall in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and this sword was still in the chapel when he died in 1437. The sword was then acquired by Henry Hanslapp, dean of Windsor, who was also a canon of Howden and native of York. On 5 May 1439 Henry Hanslapp presented the sword to the City of York. The Sigismund sword blade is blued and inscribed with the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I.

The song recounts the story of a sailor who dreams about Lady Franklin speaking of the loss of her husband, Sir John Franklin, who disappeared in Baffin Bay during his 1845 expedition through the Arctic Ocean in search of the Northwest Passage sea route to the Pacific ocean. The song first appeared as a broadside ballad around 1850 and has since been recorded with the melody of the Irish traditional air \\"Cail√≠n √ìg a St√≥r\\" by numerous artists. It has been found in Ireland, in the UK (Scotland), and in some regions of Canada. Composition The song consists of five verses using the AABB rhyme scheme. The song is told from the perspective of a sailor onboard a ship. He tells of a dream he had of Lady Jane Franklin speaking of the loss of her husband, Sir John Franklin, who disappeared in Baffin Bay during his 1845 expedition through the Arctic Ocean in search of a Northwest Passage sea route to the Pacific ocean. Following his disappearance, Lady Franklin sponsored seven expeditions to find some trace of her husband. Through her sponsorship, influence, and offering of sizeable rewards, she supported numerous other searches. Her efforts brought great publicity to the expedition's fate. In 1854, Scottish explorer Dr. John Rae discovered evidence through talking to Inuit hunters, among others that the expedition had wintered in 1845‚Äì46 on Beechey Island. The expedition's ships, and , became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note later found on that island, Franklin died there on 11 June 1847. The exact location of his grave remains unknown. History \\"Lady Franklin's Lament\\" first appeared as a broadside ballad around 1850. Found in Canada, Scotland, and Ireland, the song was first published in 1878 in Eighteen Months on a Greenland Whaler by Joseph P. Faulkner. The song may have been inspired by the traditional Irish ballad \\"The Croppy Boy\\", which is set during the 1798 rising. Versions of that ballad first appeared shortly after the rising sung by street peddlers. Several broadside versions of the ballad were printed. These typically include the phrase \\"500 Guineas\\" or \\"one thousand pounds\\", and are also sung to the melody of the traditional Irish air \\"Cail√≠n √ìg a St√≥r\\". These versions of \\"The Croppy Boy\\" may have been the basis for the later ballad, \\"Lady Franklin's Lament\\". Recordings \\"Lady Franklin's Lament\\" has been recorded by numerous artists (including Pat Maher and Alphonse Sutton). A version was recorded as \\"Lord Franklin\\" by M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill and Kevin Burke on their album Promenade (1979). Other notable renditions were recorded by Liam Clancy, Pentangle, Martin Carthy, John Renbourn, and Sin√©ad O'Connor. Several variations and adaptations of the song have been recorded, such as version by the Duncan McFarlane Band, where the chorus of \\"Northwest Passage\\" is added to the end. Bob Dylan wrote his own lyrics to the song's melody‚Äîfrom the traditional air \\"Cail√≠n √ìg a St√≥r\\"‚Äîfor his song \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\", which appeared on his 1963 album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.

The lift station was dedicated as a Texas Historic Landmark by the Texas Historical Commission in 1985. There are many irrigation canals in Texas. The majority of large canal networks are in the Rio Grande Valley and the Gulf Coast, though smaller systems are located throughout the state. Canals provide water to dry climates to irrigate crops.  Rio Grande Valley Canals  = El Paso area canals (upper Rio Grande valley)= The upper valley canals are in the southern part of the Upper Colorado Region Irrigating canal, El Paso, Texas (postcard, circa 1908) One large canal system in Texas is located along the Rio Grande near El Paso. The canal system begins at the American Diversion Dam on the Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico‚ÄìMexico border; it moves water into the American Canal on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande. This canal runs along the Rio Grande through the city of El Paso. Downstream from El Paso, the canal begins to divide into smaller canals (including the Franklin Canal) used to irrigate a great amount of the upper Rio Grande valley (El Paso and Hudspeth county water districts). The network is managed by the US Bureau of Reclamation. The major canals in this network are the Riverside Canal (El Paso), American Canal, and the Franklin Canal. A similar canal system exists on the Mexican side of the river, beginning in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua. = Eagle Pass canals = A canal system had been planned in Eagle Pass since 1885, when rancher Patrick W. Thompson drew up plans for an irrigation canal network. Construction on the project commenced in 1889. Progress was stopped due to a lack of funding after only three miles of canal were built. Construction on the project did not begin again until 1926, when Capt. W. A. Fitch pushed for construction. The canal began operation in 1932, and in the early 1970s, the main canal ran . Onions and figs were among the first crops grown here. = Lower Rio Grande valley canals = Citrus is among the foods grown in the lower Rio Grande valley A large canal system is located in the lower Rio Grande valley, at the southernmost tip of Texas. The area is covered by 25 water districts, stretching three counties. The tropical climate of this area provides ideal conditions for growing citrus fruits, watermelons, and many other fruits and vegetables. It is the state's primary growing area for many crops, including citrus.  Texas Colorado River canals  Another large system of canals in Texas is located on the Colorado River (not connected to the other Colorado River) in the Gulf Coast region. The canal network of is managed by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and provides water to farm a region with inadequate and unreliable rainfall. Texas produces 7% of the nation's rice, and the majority of this rice is grown along the Colorado River. Nine pumping stations provide water to the canals. The network covers up to in Colorado, Matagorda, and Wharton Counties.  Phantom Lake Canal  The Phantom Lake Canal is a canal in West Texas. The canal is used for irrigating vineyards, orchards, and other crops. The excess water in the canal feeds Lake Balmorhea. (Also See Balmorhea Canals)  Balmorhea canals  The Balmorhea canal system acquires water from San Solomon Springs and transports it to nearby farms for irrigation. The water leaves the San Solomon Springs swimming pool in Balmorhea State Park in one large canal. The canal begins to divide after it leaves the park.  East Texas canals  The canals in East Texas serve several purposes including delivery of water to farms throughout the area. There are many separate canals, most of them located to the East of Houston and the West of Beaumont. The canals are often mistaken for drainage ditches, which are very common in the area. The canals can usually be identified by several characteristics: *The water level is above or close to ground level, and may have berms *Usually straight with occasional turns as opposed to naturally flowing streams *May have locks or valves to control water Although the canals are mostly located in remote areas, they can be seen from I-10 in certain places, both following and crossing the highway. Other major highway canal crossings include US 90, US 69, US 96, and US 287 in Beaumont and the surrounding areas. =Gulf Coast Water Authority= Source: The Gulf Coast Water Authority operates several canals. The American Canal and Briscoe Canal systems were originally built to provide irrigation for rice and sugar cane farming in Brazoria, Fort Bend, and Galveston counties. =Lower Neches Valley Authority= Source: A large portion of the canals in Southeast Texas are owned and operated by the Lower Neches Valley Authority. The LNVA, the second river district created by the state of Texas, is currently one of 23 river districts in the state. The Lower Neches Valley Authority was granted authority by the Texas legislature in 1933 to operate within Hardin, Jefferson, and Tyler counties and eastern Chambers and Liberty counties. The LNVA system includes 400 miles of canals covering a 700 square mile area. The canals deliver fresh water to \\"...eight cities and water districts, 26 industries, and over 100 irrigated farms...\\" Water is drawn from the lower Neches River and Pine Island Bayou in north Beaumont with 21 large pumps delivering between 20,000 and 110,000 gallons of water a minute with a capability of delivering over one billion gallons of water a day. A permanent saltwater barrier across the Neches River is located downstream of confluence of Pine Island Bayou and the Neches River within one-half mile of the confluence point. The barrier, constructed between 2000 and 2003, prevents saltwater contamination during periods of low river flows. The permanent saltwater barrier project had a budgeted cost of $50 million with the federal government paying 75% of the cost and the LNVA responsible for the remaining 25%. The barrier, over 1,000 feet long, includes a 650 foot long overflow barrier; five forty-five foot wide tainter gates; and a fifty-six foot wide navigation lane regulated by two thirty foot sector gates. Temporary barriers were installed across Pine Island Bayou and the Neches River upstream of the confluence 36 times between 1940 and 2000 prior to construction of the permanent barrier. =Sabine River Authority= Source: The Sabine River Authority John W. Simmons Gulf Coast Canal System provides water for irrigation as well as industrial and municipal purposes.

Using a kernel, the originally linear operations of PCA are performed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Background: Linear PCA Recall that conventional PCA operates on zero-centered data; that is, :\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\mathbf{0}, where \\\\mathbf{x}_i is the vector of one of the N multivariate observations. It operates by diagonalizing the covariance matrix, :C=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\mathbf{x}_i^\\\\top in other words, it gives an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix: :\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{v}=C\\\\mathbf{v} which can be rewritten as :\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{x}_i^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\mathbf{x}_i^\\\\top C\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\quad \\\\textrm{for}~i=1,\\\\ldots,N.Nonlinear Component Analysis as a Kernel Eigenvalue Problem (Technical Report) (See also: Covariance matrix as a linear operator) Introduction of the Kernel to PCA To understand the utility of kernel PCA, particularly for clustering, observe that, while N points cannot, in general, be linearly separated in d < N dimensions, they can almost always be linearly separated in d \\\\geq N dimensions. That is, given N points, \\\\mathbf{x}_i, if we map them to an N-dimensional space with :\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) where \\\\Phi : \\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^N, it is easy to construct a hyperplane that divides the points into arbitrary clusters. Of course, this \\\\Phi creates linearly independent vectors, so there is no covariance on which to perform eigendecomposition explicitly as we would in linear PCA. Instead, in kernel PCA, a non-trivial, arbitrary \\\\Phi function is 'chosen' that is never calculated explicitly, allowing the possibility to use very-high-dimensional \\\\Phi's if we never have to actually evaluate the data in that space. Since we generally try to avoid working in the \\\\Phi-space, which we will call the 'feature space', we can create the N-by-N kernel :K = k(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}) = (\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{y})) = \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x})^T\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{y}) which represents the inner product space (see Gramian matrix) of the otherwise intractable feature space. The dual form that arises in the creation of a kernel allows us to mathematically formulate a version of PCA in which we never actually solve the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix in the \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x})-space (see Kernel trick). The N-elements in each column of K represent the dot product of one point of the transformed data with respect to all the transformed points (N points). Some well-known kernels are shown in the example below. Because we are never working directly in the feature space, the kernel-formulation of PCA is restricted in that it computes not the principal components themselves, but the projections of our data onto those components. To evaluate the projection from a point in the feature space \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) onto the kth principal component V^k (where superscript k means the component k, not powers of k) :{\\\\mathbf{V}^k}^T\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) =\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{a_i}^k\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x_i})\\\\right)^T\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) We note that \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x_i})^T\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) denotes dot product, which is simply the elements of the kernel K. It seems all that's left is to calculate and normalize the \\\\mathbf{a_i}^k, which can be done by solving the eigenvector equation :N \\\\lambda\\\\mathbf{a} =K\\\\mathbf{a} where N is the number of data points in the set, and \\\\lambda and \\\\mathbf{a} are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of K. Then to normalize the eigenvectors \\\\mathbf{a}^k's, we require that :1 = (\\\\mathbf{V}^k)^T \\\\mathbf{V}^k Care must be taken regarding the fact that, whether or not x has zero-mean in its original space, it is not guaranteed to be centered in the feature space (which we never compute explicitly). Since centered data is required to perform an effective principal component analysis, we 'centralize' K to become K' :K' = K - \\\\mathbf{1_N} K - K \\\\mathbf{1_N} + \\\\mathbf{1_N} K \\\\mathbf{1_N} where \\\\mathbf{1_N} denotes a N-by-N matrix for which each element takes value 1/N. We use K' to perform the kernel PCA algorithm described above. One caveat of kernel PCA should be illustrated here. In linear PCA, we can use the eigenvalues to rank the eigenvectors based on how much of the variation of the data is captured by each principal component. This is useful for data dimensionality reduction and it could also be applied to KPCA. However, in practice there are cases that all variations of the data are same. This is typically caused by a wrong choice of kernel scale. Large Datasets In practice, a large data set leads to a large K, and storing K may become a problem. One way to deal with this is to perform clustering on the dataset, and populate the kernel with the means of those clusters. Since even this method may yield a relatively large K, it is common to compute only the top P eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the eigenvalues are calculated in this way. Example Input points before kernel PCA Consider three concentric clouds of points (shown); we wish to use kernel PCA to identify these groups. The color of the points does not represent information involved in the algorithm, but only shows how the transformation relocates the data points. First, consider the kernel : k(\\\\boldsymbol{x},\\\\boldsymbol{y}) = (\\\\boldsymbol{x}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{y} + 1)^2 Applying this to kernel PCA yields the next image. Output after kernel PCA with k(\\\\boldsymbol{x},\\\\boldsymbol{y}) = (\\\\boldsymbol{x}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{y} + 1)^2. The three groups are distinguishable using the first component only. Now consider a Gaussian kernel: : k(\\\\boldsymbol{x},\\\\boldsymbol{y}) = e^\\\\frac{-\\\\boldsymbol{x} - \\\\boldsymbol{y}^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}, That is, this kernel is a measure of closeness, equal to 1 when the points coincide and equal to 0 at infinity. Output after kernel PCA, with a Gaussian kernel. Note in particular that the first principal component is enough to distinguish the three different groups, which is impossible using only linear PCA, because linear PCA operates only in the given (in this case two-dimensional) space, in which these concentric point clouds are not linearly separable. Applications Kernel PCA has been demonstrated to be useful for novelty detection and image de-noising.Kernel PCA and De-Noising in Feature Spaces.

He took his name from the earlier Amorite ruler Niqmaddu, meaning \\"Addu has vindicated\\" to strengthen the supposed origins of his Ugaritic dynasty in the Amorites. Though the exact date of his accession to the throne of Ugarit is unknown, he might be a contemporary of both Akhenaten and Tutankhamun the Hittite ruler Shuppiluliuma I, and was a vassal of the latter. He had good relations with Egypt, and conceded to the Amorites in a dispute over the Shiyannu region early in his reign. He commissioned the Baal cycle about the god Haddu/Ba'al, and had a son, Niqmepa. In EA 49, Niqmaddu II apparently requested an Egyptian physician and two palace attendants from \\"Cush\\", the Egyptian envoy to Ugarit.

Niqmepa was a contemporary of Mursili II and Hattusili III, the great Hittite kings, as well as Horemheb and Seti I of Egypt. Reign  His reign is well documented by cuneiform texts found at Ugarit. He ruled for about fifty years (c. 1320‚Äì1270 BC) making his reign one of the longest in Ugarit history. He was the son of Niqmaddu II, and the brother and successor of Arhalba. Arhalba only ruled for two years and was forced to abdicate in favor of his brother by the Hittite king Mursili II after his failed attempt to reproach Egypt for an alliance against the Hittites. Niqmepa was installed by the Hittite king Mursili II after forcing the former king, his brother Arhalba to abdicate the throne in favour of him and was forced to sign a new treaty declaring explicitly that Ugarit was a vassal state of the Hittites. The treaty reveals that Niqmepa had a harem, and states that his woman and children will be held responsible if he fails to honor his obligations. At the same time Ugarit lost control of the territory of Shiyannu to the east, which halved the area controlled by Niqmepa. The secession was confirmed by Mursili II and Shiyannu was placed under the direct control of Carchemish, which was ruled by descendants of Hittite kings as \\"viceroys\\". However, because of the loss of Shiyannu, and by request from Niqmepa, the tribute of Ugarit was reduced by a third. During Niqmepa's reign Ugarit became entirely encircled by areas under Hittite control. Niqmepa married princess Ahatmilku, of the Amurru kingdom to the south.  Death  After a long reign of about 50 years as the vassal of four successive Hittite kings, Niqmepa was succeeded by his son, the lesser known Ammittamru II.

It was written by L. Frank Baum and produced by Baum and composer Louis F. Gottschalk. The film is an adaptation of Baum's 1905 novel, Queen Zixi of Ix. Production The Magic Cloak of Oz had distribution problems, owing to the box office failure of The Patchwork Girl of Oz. Advertisements claimed that the film would be released September 28, 1914, by Paramount Pictures, but this apparently never occurred, though it was apparently released in its entirety in 1917. It was eventually reduced from a five-reel film to two two-reel films known as The Magic Cloak and The Witch Queen. The current prints are assembled from these two films, and so the film is incomplete. All of its titles are missing, and The Magic Cloak title card, which is not in The Oz Film Manufacturing Company style, is used without any additional credits. Its only allusion to Oz is a title card's claim that the fairies of Burzee are \\"fairies of Oz\\". Cast Intertitles confirm that the cast included Violet MacMillan as Timothy, or Bud, who becomes king of Noland due to a legal loophole; Mildred Harris as his sister, Margaret, or Fluff; Fred Woodward as Nicodemus, the mule, and possibly some other animals as well, and Vivian Reed as Quavo, the minstrel. Juanita Hansen appeared in the film, early in her career. 16 mm prints of this film are distributed by Em Gee and have been released on home video in various formats with different, and sometimes no, musical accompaniments. None include that which Gottschalk wrote for the film. Its highest profile release is on the third disc of the 2005 3-disc edition of The Wizard of Oz (1939 film). The film consisted of 5 reels, which translates to 38 minutes runtime, at 24 frames per second). In 2009, a longer version of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray (though not in high definition) as part of the Ultimate Collector's Editions of The Wizard of Oz. The presentation runs about five and a half minutes longer than the 2005 version and does not contain a musical score. Additional scenes were included, and subplots were expanded upon, including Nicodemus getting help from 4 witches (from His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz ), the Roly-Rogues clapping hands on a hill and a sailor making a necktie of a piece of the Magic Cloak he bought. This version was only held in private collections and shown at private conventions prior to the home video release. Blooper One intertitle refers to Jikki as \\"silly old Zixi\\". Later Zixi is introduced with the same name. The name Jikki is used in the book for the first character, but never in the intertitles as a result of this mistake.

It can refer to a city, a town, a village, a small grouping of them, or a rural area. Canada In Canada, municipal districts are a type of rural municipality in Alberta that is governed by elected councils with the mandate to administer rural areas that can include farmlands, resource areas, and unincorporated hamletss and rural residential subdivisions. Statistics Canada recognizes Alberta's 64 municipal districts as a type of census subdivision for statistical purposes. In Alberta, the term county is synonymous with the term municipal district and is not its own incorporated municipal status that is different from that of a municipal district. As such, Alberta Municipal Affairs provides municipal districts with the opportunity to brand themselves either as municipal districts or counties in their official names. A county in Alberta used to be a type of designation in a single-tier municipal system, but it was changed to \\"municipal district\\" under the Municipal Government Act, when the County Act was repealed in the mid-1990s. They were then also permitted to retain the usage of county in their official names. Statistics Canada also refers to Nova Scotia's 12 district municipalities as municipal districts for census subdivision purposes. The City of Flin Flon in Manitoba also held a municipal district status between 1933 and 1946. Dominican Republic In the Dominican Republic, when a municipality consists of more than one urban center, those beside the municipalities seat can be elevated to the status of a municipal district (distrito municipal). A municipal council (Junta Municipal) for such a municipal district is nominated by the municipal council of the municipality to which it belongs (Ley 3455 Titulo I Capitulo IV). Republic of Ireland In Ireland, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 brought in a system of municipal districts for local government purposes from 1 June 2014 following local elections in May, replacing town and borough councils. The districts are second-tier units below counties, with the exception of the Dublin Region and Cork and Galway cities which retained their existing local government structures. The districts act as constituencies for county councils, with councillors being simultaneously elected to both bodies. Some municipal districts are titled \\"borough districts\\" (Clonmel, Drogheda, Sligo and Wexford) or \\"metropolitan districts\\" (Limerick and Waterford), though they have no additional powers.Department of Environment, Community and Local Government - Local Government Reform (2014)Local Government Reform Act 2014 Russia In Russia, municipal districts are a form of local self-government and a type of municipal formations.

It is dubbed Time-evolving Block Decimation because it dynamically identifies the relevant low-dimensional Hilbert subspaces of an exponentially larger original Hilbert space. The algorithm, based on the Matrix Product States formalism, is highly efficient when the amount of entanglement in the system is limited, a requirement fulfilled by a large class of quantum many-body systems in one dimension. Introduction There is nowadays a considerable interest in the field of quantum theory for computational methods well-suited to the physics of many- body systems. Considering the inherent difficulties of simulating general quantum many-body systems, the exponential increase in parameters with the size of the system, and correspondingly, the high computational costs, one solution would be to look for numerical methods that deal with special cases, where one can profit from the physics of the system. The raw approach, by directly dealing with all the parameters used to fully characterize a quantum many-body system is seriously impeded by the lavishly exponential buildup with the system size of the amount of variables needed for simulation, which leads, in the best cases, to unreasonably long computational times and extended use of memory. To get around this problem a number of various methods have been developed and put into practice in the course of time, one of the most successful ones being the quantum Monte Carlo method (QMC). Also the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, next to QMC, is a very reliable method, with an expanding community of users and an increasing number of applications to physical systems. When the first quantum computer is plugged in and functioning, the perspectives for the field of computational physics will look rather promising, but until that day one has to restrict oneself to the mundane tools offered by classical computers. While experimental physicists are putting a lot of effort in trying to build the first quantum computer, theoretical physicists are searching, in the field of quantum information theory (QIT), for genuine quantum algorithms, appropriate for problems that would perform badly when trying to be solved on a classical computer, but pretty fast and successful on a quantum one. The search for such algorithms is still going, the best-known (and almost the only ones found) being the Shor's algorithm, for factoring large numbers, and Grover's search algorithm. In the field of QIT one has to identify the primary resources necessary for genuine quantum computation. Such a resource may be responsible for the speedup gain in quantum versus classical, identifying them means also identifying systems that can be simulated in a reasonably efficient manner on a classical computer. Such a resource is quantum entanglement; hence, it is possible to establish a distinct lower bound for the entanglement needed for quantum computational speedups. Guifr√© Vidal, then at the Institute for Quantum Information, Caltech, has recently proposed a scheme useful for simulating a certain category of quantum systems. He asserts that \\"any quantum computation with pure states can be efficiently simulated with a classical computer provided the amount of entanglement involved is sufficiently restricted\\" . This happens to be the case with generic Hamiltonians displaying local interactions, as for example, Hubbard-like Hamiltonians. The method exhibits a low-degree polynomial behavior in the increase of computational time with respect to the amount of entanglement present in the system. The algorithm is based on a scheme that exploits the fact that in these one- dimensional systems the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix on a bipartite split of the system are exponentially decaying, thus allowing us to work in a re-sized space spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues we selected. One can also estimate the amount of computational resources required for the simulation of a quantum system on a classical computer, knowing how the entanglement contained in the system scales with the size of the system. The classically (and quantum, as well) feasible simulations are those that involve systems only lightly entangled‚Äîthe strongly entangled ones being, on the other hand, good candidates only for genuine quantum computations. The numerical method is efficient in simulating real- time dynamics or calculations of ground states using imaginary-time evolution or isentropic interpolations between a target Hamiltonian and a Hamiltonian with an already-known ground state. The computational time scales linearly with the system size, hence many-particles systems in 1D can be investigated. A useful feature of the TEBD algorithm is that it can be reliably employed for time evolution simulations of time-dependent Hamiltonians, describing systems that can be realized with cold atoms in optical lattices, or in systems far from equilibrium in quantum transport. From this point of view, TEBD had a certain ascendance over DMRG, a very powerful technique, but until recently not very well suited for simulating time-evolutions. With the Matrix Product States formalism being at the mathematical heart of DMRG, the TEBD scheme was adopted by the DMRG community, thus giving birth to the time dependent DMRG , t-DMRG for short. Around the same time, other groups have developed similar approaches in which quantum information plays a predominant role as, for example, in DMRG implementations for periodic boundary conditions , and for studying mixed-state dynamics in one-dimensional quantum lattice systems,. Those last approaches actually provide a formalism that is more general than the original TEBD approach, as it also allows to deal with evolutions with matrix product operators; this enables the simulation of nontrivial non- infinitesimal evolutions as opposed to the TEBD case, and is a crucial ingredient to deal with higher-dimensional analogues of matrix product states. The decomposition of state =Introducing the decomposition of State= Consider a chain of N qubits, described by the function  \\\\Psi \\\\rangle \\\\in H^{{\\\\otimes} N }. The most natural way of describing  \\\\Psi \\\\rangle would be using the local M^N-dimensional basis  i_1,i_2,..,i_{N-1},i_N \\\\rangle: : \\\\Psi \\\\rangle=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{M}c_{i_1i_2..i_N}  {i_1,i_2,..,i_{N-1},i_N} \\\\rangle where M is the on-site dimension. The trick of TEBD is to re-write the coefficients c_{i_1i_2..i_N}: : c_{i_1i_2..i_N}=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha_1,..,\\\\alpha_{N-1}=0}^{\\\\chi}\\\\Gamma^{[1]i_1}_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\lambda^{[1]}_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\Gamma^{[2]i_2}_{\\\\alpha_1\\\\alpha_2}\\\\lambda^{[2]}_{\\\\alpha_2}\\\\Gamma^{[3]i_3}_{\\\\alpha_2\\\\alpha_3}\\\\lambda^{[3]}_{\\\\alpha_3}\\\\cdot..\\\\cdot\\\\Gamma^{[{N-1}]i_{N-1}}_{\\\\alpha_{N-2}\\\\alpha_{N-1}}\\\\lambda^{[N-1]}_{\\\\alpha_{N-1}}\\\\Gamma^{[N]i_N}_{\\\\alpha_{N-1}} This form, known as a Matrix product state, simplifies the calculations greatly. To understand why, one can look at the Schmidt decomposition of a state, which uses singular value decomposition to express a state with limited entanglement more simply. =The Schmidt decomposition= Consider the state of a bipartite system \\\\vert \\\\Psi \\\\rangle \\\\in {H_A \\\\otimes H_B}. Every such state {\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle can be represented in an appropriately chosen basis as: :{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{M_{AB}}a_i{\\\\Phi^A_i \\\\Phi^B_i}\\\\rangle where {\\\\Phi^A_i \\\\Phi^B_i}\\\\rangle= {\\\\Phi^A_i}\\\\rangle\\\\otimes  {\\\\Phi^B_i}\\\\rangle are formed with vectors {\\\\Phi^A_i}\\\\rangle that make an orthonormal basis in H_A and, correspondingly, vectors {\\\\Phi^B_i}\\\\rangle, which form an orthonormal basis in {H_B}, with the coefficients a_i being real and positive, \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{M_{AB}}a^2_i = 1. This is called the Schmidt decomposition (SD) of a state. In general the summation goes up to M_{AB}=\\\\min(\\\\dim(),\\\\dim()). The Schmidt rank of a bipartite split is given by the number of non-zero Schmidt coefficients. If the Schmidt rank is one, the split is characterized by a product state. The vectors of the SD are determined up to a phase and the eigenvalues and the Schmidt rank are unique. For example, the two-qubit state: : {\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(  {00}\\\\rangle + {\\\\sqrt{3}}  {01}\\\\rangle + {\\\\sqrt{3}}  {10}\\\\rangle + {11}\\\\rangle\\\\right) has the following SD: : {\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}+1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}{\\\\phi^{A}_1\\\\phi^{B}_1}\\\\rangle + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}{\\\\phi^{A}_2\\\\phi^{B}_2}\\\\rangle with :{\\\\phi^{A}_1}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}({0_{A}}\\\\rangle+{1_{A}}\\\\rangle), \\\\ \\\\ {\\\\phi^{B}_1}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}({0_{B}}\\\\rangle+{1_{B}}\\\\rangle), \\\\ \\\\ {\\\\phi^{A}_2}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}({0_{A}}\\\\rangle-{1_{A}}\\\\rangle), \\\\ \\\\ {\\\\phi^{B}_2}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}({1_{B}}\\\\rangle-{0_{B}}\\\\rangle) On the other hand, the state: :{\\\\Phi}\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}{00}\\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}}{01}\\\\rangle- \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{3}}{10}\\\\rangle - \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{6}}{11}\\\\rangle is a product state: :{\\\\Phi}\\\\rangle = {(}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}{0_{A}}\\\\rangle-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{3}}{1_{A}}\\\\rangle{)} \\\\otimes {(}{0_{B}}\\\\rangle+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}{1_{B}}\\\\rangle{)} =Building the decomposition of state= At this point we probably know enough to try to see how we explicitly build the decomposition (let's call it D). Consider the bipartite splitting [1]:[2..N]. The SD has the coefficients \\\\lambda^{[1]}_{{\\\\alpha}_1} and eigenvectors {\\\\Phi^{[1]}_{\\\\alpha_1}}\\\\rangle { \\\\Phi^{[2..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1}}\\\\rangle. By expanding the {\\\\Phi^{[1]}_{\\\\alpha_1}}\\\\rangle's in the local basis, one can write: :{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i_1,{\\\\alpha_1=1}}^{M,\\\\chi}\\\\Gamma^{[1]i_1}_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\lambda^{[1]}_{\\\\alpha_1}{i_1}\\\\rangle{\\\\Phi^{[2..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1}}\\\\rangle The process can be decomposed in three steps, iterated for each bond (and, correspondingly, SD) in the chain: Step 1: express the {\\\\Phi^{[2..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1}}\\\\rangle's in a local basis for qubit 2: : {\\\\Phi^{[2..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1}}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{i_2}{i_2}\\\\rangle{\\\\tau^{[3..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1i_2}}\\\\rangle The vectors {\\\\tau^{[3..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1i_2}}\\\\rangle are not necessarily normalized. Step 2: write each vector {\\\\tau^{[3..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1i_2}}\\\\rangle in terms of the at most (Vidal's emphasis) \\\\chi Schmidt vectors {\\\\Phi^{[3..N]}_{\\\\alpha_2}}\\\\rangle and, correspondingly, coefficients \\\\lambda^{[2]}_{{\\\\alpha}_2}: :\\\\tau^{[3..N]}_{\\\\alpha_1i_2}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha_2}\\\\Gamma^{[2]i_2}_{\\\\alpha_1\\\\alpha_2}\\\\lambda^{[2]}_{{\\\\alpha}_2}{\\\\Phi^{[3..N]}_{\\\\alpha_2}}\\\\rangle Step 3: make the substitutions and obtain: :{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{i_1,i_2,\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2}\\\\Gamma^{[1]i_1}_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\lambda^{[1]}_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\Gamma^{[2]i_2}_{\\\\alpha_1\\\\alpha_2}\\\\lambda^{[2]}_{{\\\\alpha}_2}{i_1i_2}\\\\rangle{\\\\Phi^{[3..N]}_{\\\\alpha_2}}\\\\rangle Repeating the steps 1 to 3, one can construct the whole decomposition of state D. The last \\\\Gamma's are a special case, like the first ones, expressing the right-hand Schmidt vectors at the (N-1)^{th} bond in terms of the local basis at the N^{th} lattice place. As shown in, it is straightforward to obtain the Schmidt decomposition at k^{th} bond, i.e. [1..k]:[k+1..N], from D. The Schmidt eigenvalues, are given explicitly in D: :{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha_k}\\\\lambda^{[k]}_{{\\\\alpha}_k}{\\\\Phi^{[1..k]}_{\\\\alpha_k}}\\\\rangle{\\\\Phi^{[k+1..N]}_{\\\\alpha_k}}\\\\rangle The Schmidt eigenvectors are simply: :{\\\\Phi^{[1..k]}_{\\\\alpha_k}}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2..\\\\alpha_{k-1}}\\\\Gamma^{[1]i_1}_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\lambda^{[1]}_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\Gamma^{[k]i_k}_{\\\\alpha_{k-1}\\\\alpha_k}{i_1i_2..i_k}\\\\rangle and :{\\\\Phi^{[k+1..N]}_{\\\\alpha_k}}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha_{k+1},\\\\alpha_{k+2}..\\\\alpha_{N}}\\\\Gamma^{[k+1]i_{k+1}}_{\\\\alpha_k\\\\alpha_{k+1}}\\\\lambda^{[k+1]}_{\\\\alpha_{k+1}}\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\lambda^{N-1}_{\\\\alpha_{N-1}}\\\\Gamma^{[N]i_N}_{\\\\alpha_{N-1}}{i_{k+1}i_{k+2}..i_N}\\\\rangle =Rationale= Now, looking at D, instead of M^N initial terms, there are {\\\\chi}^2{\\\\cdot}M(N-2) + 2{\\\\chi}M + (N-1)\\\\chi. Apparently this is just a fancy way of rewriting the coefficients c_{i_1i_2..i_N}, but in fact there is more to it than that. Assuming that N is even, the Schmidt rank \\\\chi for a bipartite cut in the middle of the chain can have a maximal value of M^{N/2}; in this case we end up with at least M^{N+1}{\\\\cdot}(N-2) coefficients, considering only the {\\\\chi}^2 ones, slightly more than the initial M^N! The truth is that the decomposition D is useful when dealing with systems that exhibit a low degree of entanglement, which fortunately is the case with many 1D systems, where the Schmidt coefficients of the ground state decay in an exponential manner with \\\\alpha: : \\\\lambda^{[l]}_{{\\\\alpha}_l}{\\\\sim}e^{-K\\\\alpha_l},\\\\ K>0. Therefore, it is possible to take into account only some of the Schmidt coefficients (namely the largest ones), dropping the others and consequently normalizing again the state: :{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{{\\\\alpha_l}=1}^{{\\\\chi}_c}{\\\\lambda^{[l]}_\\\\cdot\\\\sum\\\\limits_{{{\\\\alpha}_l}=1}^{{\\\\chi}_c}\\\\lambda^{[l]}_{{\\\\alpha}_l}{\\\\Phi^{[1..l]}_{\\\\alpha_l}}\\\\rangle{ \\\\Phi^{[l+1..N]}_{\\\\alpha_l}}\\\\rangle, where \\\\chi_c is the number of kept Schmidt coefficients. Let's get away from this abstract picture and refresh ourselves with a concrete example, to emphasize the advantage of making this decomposition. Consider for instance the case of 50 fermions in a ferromagnetic chain, for the sake of simplicity. A dimension of 12, let's say, for the \\\\chi_c would be a reasonable choice, keeping the discarded eigenvalues at 0.0001% of the total, as shown by numerical studies, meaning roughly 2^{14} coefficients, as compared to the originally 2^{50} ones. Even if the Schmidt eigenvalues don't have this exponential decay, but they show an algebraic decrease, we can still use D to describe our state \\\\psi. The number of coefficients to account for a faithful description of \\\\psi may be sensibly larger, but still within reach of eventual numerical simulations. The update of the decomposition One can proceed now to investigate the behaviour of the decomposition D when acted upon with one-qubit gates (OQG) and two-qubit gates (TQG) acting on neighbouring qubits. Instead of updating all the M^N coefficients c_{i_1i_2..i_N}, we will restrict ourselves to a number of operations that increase in \\\\chi as a polynomial of low degree, thus saving computational time. =One-qubit gates acting on qubit k= The OQGs are affecting only the qubit they are acting upon, the update of the state {\\\\psi}\\\\rangle after a unitary operator at qubit k does not modify the Schmidt eigenvalues or vectors on the left, consequently the \\\\Gamma^{[k-1]}'s, or on the right, hence the \\\\Gamma^{[k+1]}'s. The only \\\\Gamma's that will be updated are the \\\\Gamma^{[k]}'s (requiring only at most (M^2\\\\cdot\\\\chi^2) operations), as :\\\\Gamma^{'[k]i_k}_{\\\\alpha_{k-1}\\\\alpha_k}=\\\\sum_{j}U^{i_k}_{j_k}\\\\Gamma^{[k]j_k}_{\\\\alpha_{k-1}\\\\alpha_k}. =Two-qubit gates acting on qubits k, k+1= The changes required to update the \\\\Gamma's and the \\\\lambda's, following a unitary operation V on qubits k, k+1, concern only \\\\Gamma^{[k]}, and \\\\Gamma^{[k+1]}. They consist of a number of ({M\\\\cdot\\\\chi}^3) basic operations. Following Vidal's original approach, {\\\\psi}\\\\rangle can be regarded as belonging to only four subsystems: :{{H}=J{}H_C{\\\\otimes}H_D{\\\\otimes}K}.\\\\, The subspace J is spanned by the eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix \\\\rho^{J}=Tr_{CDK}\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi: :\\\\rho^{[1..{k-1}]}=\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha}{(\\\\lambda^{[k-1]}_{\\\\alpha})}^2{\\\\Phi^{[1..{k-1}]}_{\\\\alpha}}\\\\rangle\\\\langle{\\\\Phi^{[1..{k-1}]}_{\\\\alpha}}=\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha}{(\\\\lambda^{[k-1]}_{\\\\alpha})^2}{\\\\alpha}\\\\rangle\\\\langle{\\\\alpha}. In a similar way, the subspace K is spanned by the eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix: :\\\\rho^{[{k+2}..{N}]}=\\\\sum_{\\\\gamma}{(\\\\lambda^{[k+1]}_{\\\\gamma})^2}{\\\\Phi^{[{k+2}..N]}_{\\\\gamma}}\\\\rangle\\\\langle{\\\\Phi^{[{k+2}..N]}_{\\\\gamma}}=\\\\sum_{\\\\gamma}{(\\\\lambda^{[k+1]}_{\\\\gamma})^2}{\\\\gamma}\\\\rangle\\\\langle{\\\\gamma}. The subspaces H_C and H_D belong to the qubits k and k + 1. Using this basis and the decomposition D, {\\\\psi}\\\\rangle can be written as: :{\\\\psi}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma=1}^{\\\\chi}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i,j=1}^{M}\\\\lambda^{[C-1]}_{\\\\alpha}\\\\Gamma^{[C]i}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\lambda^{[C]}_{\\\\beta}\\\\Gamma^{[D]j}_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}\\\\lambda^{[D]}_{\\\\gamma}{{\\\\alpha}ij{\\\\gamma}}\\\\rangle Using the same reasoning as for the OQG, the applying the TQG V to qubits k, k + 1 one needs only to update :\\\\Gamma^{[C]}, \\\\lambda and \\\\Gamma^{[D]}. We can write {\\\\psi'}\\\\rangle=V{\\\\psi}\\\\rangle as: :{\\\\psi'}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha,\\\\gamma=1}^{\\\\chi}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i,j=1}^{M}\\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha}\\\\Theta^{ij}_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}\\\\lambda_{\\\\gamma}{{\\\\alpha}ij\\\\gamma}\\\\rangle where :\\\\Theta^{ij}_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\beta=1}^{\\\\chi}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{m,n=1}^{M}V^{ij}_{mn}\\\\Gamma^{[C]m}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\lambda_{\\\\beta}\\\\Gamma^{[D]n}_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}. To find out the new decomposition, the new \\\\lambda's at the bond k and their corresponding Schmidt eigenvectors must be computed and expressed in terms of the 's of the decomposition D. The reduced density matrix \\\\rho^{'[DK]} is therefore diagonalized: :\\\\rho^{'[DK]}=Tr_{JC}{\\\\psi'}\\\\rangle\\\\langle{\\\\psi'}=\\\\sum_{j,j',\\\\gamma,\\\\gamma'}\\\\rho^{jj'}_{\\\\gamma\\\\gamma'}{j\\\\gamma}\\\\rangle\\\\langle{j'\\\\gamma'}. The square roots of its eigenvalues are the new \\\\lambda's. Expressing the eigenvectors of the diagonalized matrix in the basis :\\\\\\\\{{j\\\\gamma}\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\} the \\\\Gamma^{[}'s are obtained as well: :{\\\\Phi^{'[]}}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{j,\\\\gamma}\\\\Gamma^{'[]j}_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}\\\\lambda_{\\\\gamma}{j\\\\gamma}\\\\rangle. From the left-hand eigenvectors, :\\\\lambda^{'}_{\\\\beta}{\\\\Phi^{'[]}_{\\\\beta}}\\\\rangle=\\\\langle{\\\\Phi^{'[{DK}]}_{\\\\beta}}{\\\\psi'}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{i,j,\\\\alpha,\\\\gamma}(\\\\Gamma^{'[{D}]j}_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma})^{*}\\\\Theta^{ij}_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}(\\\\lambda_{\\\\gamma})^2\\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha}{{\\\\alpha}i}\\\\rangle after expressing them in the basis \\\\\\\\{{i\\\\alpha}\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}, the \\\\Gamma^{[{C}]}'s are: :{\\\\Phi^{'[]}}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{i,\\\\alpha}\\\\Gamma^{'[]i}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha}{{\\\\alpha}i}\\\\rangle. =The computational cost= The dimension of the largest tensors in D is of the order (M{\\\\cdot}{\\\\chi}^2); when constructing the \\\\Theta^{ij}_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma} one makes the summation over \\\\beta, \\\\it{m} and \\\\it{n} for each \\\\gamma,\\\\alpha,{\\\\it{i,j}}, adding up to a total of (M^4{\\\\cdot}{\\\\chi}^3) operations. The same holds for the formation of the elements \\\\rho^{}_{\\\\gamma\\\\gamma'}, or for computing the left-hand eigenvectors \\\\lambda^{'}_{\\\\beta}{\\\\Phi^{'[{\\\\it{JC}}]}_{\\\\beta}}\\\\rangle, a maximum of {\\\\it{O}}(M^3{\\\\cdot}{\\\\chi}^3), respectively {\\\\it{O}}(M^2{\\\\cdot}{\\\\chi}^3) basic operations. In the case of qubits, {\\\\it{M}}=2, hence its role is not very relevant for the order of magnitude of the number of basic operations, but in the case when the on-site dimension is higher than two it has a rather decisive contribution. The numerical simulation The numerical simulation is targeting (possibly time-dependent) Hamiltonians of a system of {\\\\it{N}} particles arranged in a line, which are composed of arbitrary OQGs and TQGs: :H_N=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{l=1}^{N}K^{[l]}_1 + \\\\sum\\\\limits_{l=1}^{N}K^{[l,l+1]}_2. It is useful to decompose H_N as a sum of two possibly non-commuting terms, H_N = F + G, where :F \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{even\\\\ \\\\ l}(K^{l}_1 + K^{l,l+1}_2) = \\\\sum_{even\\\\ \\\\ l}F^{[l]}, :G \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{odd \\\\ \\\\ l}(K^{l}_1 + K^{l,l+1}_2) = \\\\sum_{odd \\\\ \\\\ l}G^{[l]}. Any two-body terms commute: [F^{[l]},F^{[l']}]=0, [G^{[l]},G^{[l']}]=0 This is done to make the Suzuki-Trotter expansion (ST) of the exponential operator, named after Masuo Suzuki and Hale Trotter. =The Suzuki-Trotter expansion= The Suzuki-Trotter expansion of the first order (ST1) represents a general way of writing exponential operators: : e^{(A+B)} = \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\Bigl(e^{\\\\frac{n}}e^{\\\\frac{n}} \\\\Bigr)^n or, equivalently :e^{{\\\\delta}(A+B)} = \\\\lim_{\\\\delta\\\\rightarrow0}[e^{{\\\\delta}A}e^{{\\\\delta}B}] + {{\\\\it{O}}}(\\\\delta^2). The correction term vanishes in the limit \\\\delta\\\\rightarrow0 For simulations of quantum dynamics it is useful to use operators that are unitary, conserving the norm (unlike power series expansions), and there's where the Trotter- Suzuki expansion comes in. In problems of quantum dynamics the unitarity of the operators in the ST expansion proves quite practical, since the error tends to concentrate in the overall phase, thus allowing us to faithfully compute expectation values and conserved quantities. Because the ST conserves the phase-space volume, it is also called a symplectic integrator. The trick of the ST2 is to write the unitary operators e^{-iHt} as: :e^{-iH_N T} = [e^{-iH_N\\\\delta}]^{T/{\\\\delta}} = [e^{\\\\frac{2}F}e^{{\\\\delta}G}e^{\\\\frac{2}F}]^{n} where n=\\\\frac{T}{\\\\delta}. The number {\\\\it{n}} is called the Trotter number. =Simulation of the time-evolution= The operators e^{\\\\frac{2}F}, e^{{\\\\delta}G} are easy to express, as: :e^{\\\\frac{2}F}=\\\\prod_{even \\\\ \\\\ l}e^{\\\\frac{2}F^{[l]}} :e^{{\\\\delta}G}=\\\\prod_{odd \\\\ \\\\ l}e^{{\\\\delta}G^{[l]}} since any two operators F^{[l]},F^{[l']} (respectively, G^{[l]},G^{[l']}) commute for l{ eq}l' and an ST expansion of the first order keeps only the product of the exponentials, the approximation becoming, in this case, exact. The time-evolution can be made according to :{\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}_{t+\\\\delta}}\\\\rangle=e^{-i\\\\frac{2}F}e^{{-i\\\\delta}G}e^{\\\\frac{2}F}{\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}_{t}}\\\\rangle. For each \\"time-step\\" \\\\delta, e^{-i\\\\frac{2}F^{[l]}} are applied successively to all odd sites, then e^{{-i\\\\delta}G^{[l]}} to the even ones, and e^{-i\\\\frac{2}F^{[l]}} again to the odd ones; this is basically a sequence of TQG's, and it has been explained above how to update the decomposition {\\\\it{D}} when applying them. Our goal is to make the time evolution of a state {\\\\psi_0}\\\\rangle for a time T, towards the state {\\\\psi_{T}}\\\\rangle using the n-particle Hamiltonian H_n. It is rather troublesome, if at all possible, to construct the decomposition {\\\\it{D}} for an arbitrary n-particle state, since this would mean one has to compute the Schmidt decomposition at each bond, to arrange the Schmidt eigenvalues in decreasing order and to choose the first \\\\chi_c and the appropriate Schmidt eigenvectors. Mind this would imply diagonalizing somewhat generous reduced density matrices, which, depending on the system one has to simulate, might be a task beyond our reach and patience. Instead, one can try to do the following: i) construct the decomposition {\\\\it{D}} for a simple initial state, let us say, some product state {\\\\psi_P}\\\\rangle, for which the decomposition is straightforward. ii) relate {\\\\psi_0}\\\\rangle to the ground state {\\\\psi_{gr}}\\\\rangle of a Hamiltonian \\\\tilde{H} by a sufficiently local transformation Q (one that can be expressed as a product of TQGs, for example) {\\\\psi_0}\\\\rangle=Q{\\\\psi_{gr}}\\\\rangle iii) make an imaginary-time evolution towards the ground state of the Hamiltonian \\\\tilde{H}, {\\\\psi_{gr}}\\\\rangle according to: :{\\\\psi_{gr}}\\\\rangle=\\\\lim_{\\\\tau\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\tilde{H}\\\\tau}{\\\\psi_P}\\\\rangle}{e^{-\\\\tilde{H}\\\\tau}{\\\\psi_P}\\\\rangle}, or, alternatively, simulate an isentropic evolution using a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which interpolates between the Hamiltonian H_1, which has the product state {\\\\psi_P}\\\\rangle as its ground state, and the Hamiltonian \\\\tilde{H}; the evolution must be done slow enough, such that the system is always in the ground state or, at least, very close to it. iv)finally, make the time-evolution of the state {\\\\psi_0}\\\\rangle towards {\\\\psi_{T}}\\\\rangle using the Hamiltonian H_n: :{\\\\psi_}\\\\rangle=e^{-iH_nT}{\\\\psi_0}\\\\rangle Error sources The errors in the simulation are resulting from the Suzuki-Trotter approximation and the involved truncation of the Hilbert space. =Errors coming from the Suzuki-Trotter expansion= In the case of a Trotter approximation of {\\\\it{p^{th}}} order, the error is of order {\\\\delta}^{p+1}. Taking into account n=\\\\frac{T}{\\\\delta} steps, the error after the time T is: : \\\\epsilon=\\\\frac{T}{\\\\delta}\\\\delta^{p+1}=T\\\\delta^p The unapproximated state {\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}_{Tr}}\\\\rangle is: :{\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}_{Tr}}\\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{1-{\\\\epsilon}^2}{\\\\psi_{Tr}}\\\\rangle + {\\\\epsilon}{\\\\psi^{\\\\bot}_{Tr}}\\\\rangle where {\\\\psi_{Tr}}\\\\rangle is the state kept after the Trotter expansion and {\\\\psi^{\\\\bot}_{Tr}}\\\\rangle accounts for the part that is neglected when doing the expansion. The total error scales with time {\\\\it{T}} as: :\\\\epsilon(}) = 1 -\\\\langle{\\\\tilde{\\\\psi_{Tr}}}{\\\\psi_}\\\\rangle^2 = 1 - 1 + \\\\epsilon^2 = \\\\epsilon^2 The Trotter error is independent of the dimension of the chain. =Errors coming from the truncation of the Hilbert space= Considering the errors arising from the truncation of the Hilbert space comprised in the decomposition D, they are twofold. First, as we have seen above, the smallest contributions to the Schmidt spectrum are left away, the state being faithfully represented up to: :\\\\epsilon(}) = 1 - \\\\prod\\\\limits_{n=1}^{N-1}(1-\\\\epsilon_n) where \\\\epsilon_n = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha=\\\\chi_c}^{\\\\chi}(\\\\lambda^{[n]}_{\\\\alpha})^2 is the sum of all the discarded eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, at the bond {\\\\it{n}}. The state {\\\\psi}\\\\rangle is, at a given bond {\\\\it{n}}, described by the Schmidt decomposition: :{\\\\psi}\\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\epsilon_n}{\\\\psi_{D}}\\\\rangle + \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_n}{\\\\psi^{\\\\bot}_{D}}\\\\rangle where :{\\\\psi_{D}}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\epsilon_n}}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{{{\\\\alpha}_n}=1}^{{\\\\chi}_c}\\\\lambda^{[n]}_{{\\\\alpha}_n}{\\\\Phi^{[1..n]}_{\\\\alpha_n}}\\\\rangle{ \\\\Phi^{[n+1..N]}_{\\\\alpha_n}}\\\\rangle is the state kept after the truncation and :{\\\\psi^{\\\\bot}_{D}}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_n}}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{{{\\\\alpha}_n}={\\\\chi}_c}^\\\\lambda^{[n]}_{{\\\\alpha}_n}{\\\\Phi^{[1..n]}_{\\\\alpha_n}}\\\\rangle{ \\\\Phi^{[n+1..N]}_{\\\\alpha_n}}\\\\rangle is the state formed by the eigenfunctions corresponding to the smallest, irrelevant Schmidt coefficients, which are neglected. Now, \\\\langle\\\\psi^{\\\\bot}_{D}\\\\psi_{D}\\\\rangle=0 because they are spanned by vectors corresponding to orthogonal spaces. Using the same argument as for the Trotter expansion, the error after the truncation is: : \\\\epsilon_n = 1 - \\\\langle{\\\\psi}\\\\psi_{D}\\\\rangle^2 = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha=\\\\chi_c}^{\\\\chi}(\\\\lambda^{[n]}_{\\\\alpha})^2 After moving to the next bond, the state is, similarly: :{\\\\psi_{D}}\\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\epsilon_{n+1}}{{{\\\\psi}'}_{D}}\\\\rangle + \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_{n+1}}{{\\\\psi'}^{\\\\bot}_{D}}\\\\rangle The error, after the second truncation, is: :\\\\epsilon = 1 - \\\\langle{\\\\psi}\\\\psi'_{D}\\\\rangle^2 = 1 - (1-\\\\epsilon_{n+1})\\\\langle{\\\\psi}\\\\psi_{D}\\\\rangle^2 = 1 - (1-\\\\epsilon_{n+1})(1-\\\\epsilon_{n}) and so on, as we move from bond to bond. The second error source enfolded in the decomposition {\\\\it{D}} is more subtle and requires a little bit of calculation. As we calculated before, the normalization constant after making the truncation at bond {\\\\it{l}} ([1..l]:[l+1..N]) is: : R = {\\\\sum\\\\limits_{{\\\\alpha_l}=1}^{{\\\\chi}_c}{\\\\lambda^{[l]}_{{\\\\alpha}_l}}^2} = {1 - \\\\epsilon_l} Now let us go to the bond {\\\\it{l}}-1 and calculate the norm of the right-hand Schmidt vectors {\\\\Phi^{[l-1..N]}_{\\\\alpha_{l-1}}}; taking into account the full Schmidt dimension, the norm is: :n_1 = 1 = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha_l=1}^{\\\\chi_c}(c_{\\\\alpha_{l-1}\\\\alpha_{l}})^2(\\\\lambda^{[l]}_{\\\\alpha_l})^2 + \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha_l=\\\\chi_c}^{\\\\chi}(c_{\\\\alpha_{l-1}\\\\alpha_{l}})^2(\\\\lambda^{[l]}_{\\\\alpha_l})^2 = S_1 +S_2, where (c_{\\\\alpha_{l-1}\\\\alpha_{l}})^2 = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i_l=1}^{d}(\\\\Gamma^{[l]i_l}_{\\\\alpha_{l-1}\\\\alpha_{l}})^{*}\\\\Gamma^{[l]i_l}_{\\\\alpha_{l-1}\\\\alpha_{l}}. Taking into account the truncated space, the norm is: :n_{2}=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha_l=1}^{\\\\chi_c} (c_{\\\\alpha_{}\\\\alpha_{l}})^2\\\\cdot({\\\\lambda'}^{[l]}_{\\\\alpha_l})^2=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\alpha_l=1}^{\\\\chi_c}(c_{\\\\alpha_{}\\\\alpha_{l}})^2\\\\frac{(\\\\lambda^{[l]}_{\\\\alpha_l})^2}{R} = \\\\frac{S_1}{R} Taking the difference, \\\\epsilon = n_2 - n_1 = n_2 - 1, we get: :\\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{S_1}{R} - 1 \\\\leq \\\\frac{1-R}{R} = \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_l}{1-\\\\epsilon_l} {\\\\rightarrow}0\\\\ \\\\ as\\\\ \\\\ {{\\\\epsilon_l{\\\\rightarrow}}} Hence, when constructing the reduced density matrix, the trace of the matrix is multiplied by the factor: :\\\\langle{\\\\psi_{D}}\\\\psi_{D}\\\\rangle^2 = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_l}{1-\\\\epsilon_l} = \\\\frac{1-2\\\\epsilon_l}{1-\\\\epsilon_l} =The total truncation error= The total truncation error, considering both sources, is upper bounded by: :\\\\epsilon() = 1 - \\\\prod\\\\limits_{n=1}^{N-1}(1-\\\\epsilon_n) \\\\prod\\\\limits_{n=1}^{N-1}\\\\frac{1-2\\\\epsilon_n}{1-\\\\epsilon_n} = 1 - \\\\prod\\\\limits_{n=1}^{N-1}(1-2\\\\epsilon_n) When using the Trotter expansion, we do not move from bond to bond, but between bonds of same parity; moreover, for the ST2, we make a sweep of the even ones and two for the odd. But nevertheless, the calculation presented above still holds. The error is evaluated by successively multiplying with the normalization constant, each time we build the reduced density matrix and select its relevant eigenvalues. \\"Adaptive\\" Schmidt dimension One thing that can save a lot of computational time without loss of accuracy is to use a different Schmidt dimension for each bond instead of a fixed one for all bonds, keeping only the necessary amount of relevant coefficients, as usual. For example, taking the first bond, in the case of qubits, the Schmidt dimension is just two. Hence, at the first bond, instead of futilely diagonalizing, let us say, 10 by 10 or 20 by 20 matrices, we can just restrict ourselves to ordinary 2 by 2 ones, thus making the algorithm generally faster. What we can do instead is set a threshold for the eigenvalues of the SD, keeping only those that are above the threshold. TEBD also offers the possibility of straightforward parallelization due to the factorization of the exponential time-evolution operator using the Suzuki-Trotter expansion. A parallel-TEBD has the same mathematics as its non- parallelized counterpart, the only difference is in the numerical implementation.

It is unique for its ability to select its prey based on what the latter has eaten. It indirectly feeds on vertebrate blood by preying mosquitos that have taken recent blood meals. Description E. culicivora has grey-brown bodies, regardless of age or sex. Adult males have blood-red faces and white-hair patches on and around their faces (e.g. above principal eyes and at side of clypeus and on palp tibia). Juveniles and adult females have grey-brown faces, but adult females have a faint red tinge. It is rare for adult females and juveniles to have white patches. Body lengths of males range from 3mm to 6mm, females from 4mm to 7mm. Evarcha culicivora Population structure, speciation, and phylogeny E. culicivora belongs to the jumping spider genus Evarcha, a relatively large genus comprised of 89 nominal species. Evarcha is widespread, ranging from the Palaearctic, Africa and southern Asia to the middle Pacific area, with a few species from America and Australia. Within the genus, species are polyphyletic as the species have very different morphology of genital organs. For example, the embolus ranges from short, strong and compact to long and filamentous, etc. Habitat and Distribution E.culicivora is found only around Lake Victoria in Kenya and Uganda. Its habitat is near walls of buildings or tree trunks. It hides in the grass or other plants close to the ground when it is quiescent. When it is hunting, it will go to more exposed locations such as the walls inside some mosquito-infested houses. Home range and territoriality =Nest and interactions at nest= Around E.culicivora spiders‚Äô common habitats, such as tree trunks, walls of buildings, they build nests on dead leaf inside their webs. Their webs are silk tubes, with length of 4 times of the resident spider‚Äôs body length and width of 6 times of the resident spider‚Äôs body width, and there are normally one or more elastic openings. The nests are built by dead, rolled-up leaves and some grass, which form an enclosed space in the spider webs. For the nests that are located at the narrow end of the cone-like space made by a tightly rolled-up leaf, there is usually only one door, opening at the wider end. For the nests that have more space, there are two openings, and it is rare to have three openings in a nest. Between female- female and male-male, the intruder intrudes when the resident is quiescent in the nest. The intruder usually probes first and then pushes its face into the silk and chews and tugs the silk. The resident would pull on the silk as a response. For male-female interaction at the nest, see the Mating section. =Cohabitation= There were some observations of males cohabiting with females. The two silk tubes are woven together and the two doors of the two chambers are aligned together. Diet =Predatory feeding= Spiders don‚Äôt normally feed directly on vertebrate blood. E. culicivora feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by preying on female mosquitoes that have had recent blood meals. E. culicivora chooses blood fed females over non-mosquito prey, male mosquitoes and sugar-fed female mosquitoes, which demonstrates their preference of blood. Small juveniles choose smaller prey while adults choose larger preys. E. culicivora may be adapted to choose preys that are easy to capture. However, their preference for blood takes precedence over their preference for size. E. culicivora‚Äôs prey-choice behavior is innate, and they can make highly specific prey identifications by sight alone or by odor alone. Evarcha-culicivora-juvenile-approaching-nectar-on-an-extrafloral-nectary-of- Ricinus-communis =Non-predatory feeding= Hunting spiders including salticids supplement their predatory diet with nectar, and nectar meals are important alternative food resource when prey are not sufficient. Lantana camara L. (family Verbenaceae) and Ricinus communis L. (family Euphorbiaceae) are two common plant species in the region where E. culicivora is populated. E. culicivora feeds on the nectar from these two plants by pressing their chelicerae into L. camara flowers, or into the extra-floral nectaries of R. comunis. A study showed that the odor of these two plants is salient to E. culicivora. See Mutualism section for more information on the spider-plant relationship. Webs Salticids are hunters, who have little use for webs. Instead, they make silk shelters under leaves. =Prey capture technique= Larger individuals of E. culicivora typically oriented towards the mosquito, regardless of the mosquito‚Äôs posture. They would then adopt the typical pre- capture behavior of salticid. They approach the prey slowly and directly with their bodies lowered, then they pause when close and then jump onto the mosquito. However, for E. culicivora juveniles, they have adopted an Anopheles-specific prey-capture behavior, using Anopheles‚Äô posture as a primary cue to identify them. Anopheles has distinctive resting posture with its abdomen angled up. E. culicivora juveniles would move behind the mosquito and under its abdomen, and then attack from below. Attacking from underneath minimizes E. culicivora juveniles‚Äô risk of being thrown off by the mosquito in flight as they can hold on the mosquito from underneath. Mating =Cannibalism= Sexual cannibalism only happens in a small portion of E. culicivora spiders, but their sexual cannibalism behavior is very unique as it is different from most of other spiders‚Äô sexual cannibalism behavior. For E. culicivora spiders, males are more likely to be the predators and females respond to them as the preys. More interestingly, sexual cannibalism in E. culicivora mainly happens when two individuals have different body lengths and normally the bigger one is the predator. There are a few common scenarios of sexual cannibalism in E. culicivora: 1) The predator stalks the prey and attacks the prey before the prey is aware. No interaction before the encounter. 2) The male predator displays at the quiescent female at a distance and when he gets close, he suddenly switches to attacking her. 3) The male predator mounts and initiates postmount courtship and then kills the quiescent female. 4) The male predator suddenly kills the female during copulation. After biting or killing, the male predator may eat her, walk away without eating her, continue copulating and then eat her, or continue copulating without eating her. =Male-Female Interaction and copulation= It is common in salticids that males initiate male-female interactions by displaying first. However, in E. culicivora, males would initiate if the female is inside the nest; but if the female is outside the nest, either sex could initiate display. For initial displaying behavior, males begin with erect posturing and females begin with hunched posturing. It is rare for males to start with dancing directly during initial male-female interaction. Dancing and spurting behaviors only happen in males. Zigzag dancing, for example, is very complex and variable. The male lowers or raises his body and step to the side, pauses, then raises or lowers his body and step to the side again. This successive zigzag dancing brings male closer to the female. Males usually direct posturing and dancing at female‚Äôs nest itself, instead of the female. A male usually begins probing at the door immediately he arrives at the female‚Äôs nest. Females would hold the door down when the male probes. As the male enters the nest, he would tap and probe his palps. Once his body is partly in the nest, he would advance towards the female. The copulatory posture is typical of most salticids. The male‚Äôs dorsal is facing to the female and they face opposite directions. Mutualism =With plants= E. culicivora has unusual association with L. camara and R. comunis not just because the spiders eat their nectar (see the Diet section). Their courtship may often take place on L. camara or R. comunis. Both sexes of E. culicivora are exaggerated when they are on these plants during display. They have more movements and more variations. The duration of the interaction is also longer. E. culicivora has high specificity in its preference to these plant species, and the odor of these two plants might prime the males and females with meeting potential mates. The relationship between E. culicivora and these plants are still largely unknown. Physiology =Vision= The jumping spiders (family Salticidae) are vision-proficient and have outstanding spatial acuity due to their complex eyes. Salticids use color as cues to make decisions such as classifying prey, identifying landmarks, etc. Color vision of green and ultraviolet are universal among salticids but different species have different mechanism of achieving certain color vision, and have different extent to which color vision is inclusive of red. In E. culicivora, only adult males, not the juveniles or adult females, have bright-red faces. Scientists have found out that the red faces, as visual stimuli, influence adult males‚Äô decisions on their behaviors during encounters with other males. The red face is not essential for E. culicivora to be able to identify the individual is a rival conspecific male, but rather, is important for them to decide what to do. When they see a red face, they would initiate displaying from further away, and escalate to higher levels of aggression. However, it is unclear if they are sensitive to specifically the brightness, chroma or hue or other factors. =Locomotion= During normal locomotion, E. culicivora walks in a similar pattern as most salticids. They step for 0.5s and pause for 0.5 in a rapid stop-and-go fashion. When they are provoked, they would quickly move away and make repeated leaps combined with running. Different from other salticids, E. culicivora is less easily to be provoked and is usually calmer. Bites to humans and animals Although E. culicivora is found near buildings occupied by people, scientists have no knowledge of anybody ever being bitten by E. culicivora. E. culicivora spiders‚Äô attempts to bite any human have never been seen remotely either. E. culicivora spider mouthparts are not specialized for piercing vertebrate skin and ingesting blood like mosquitoes, even though they feed on vertebrate blood by taking indirect blood meals from mosquitoes. Interaction with humans and livestock =Potential to fight the malaria disease= Malaria is the world‚Äôs most important insect-borne threat to public health, causing more than one million deaths per year. All vectors of human malaria are female mosquitoes from the genus Anopheles. In the region where E. culicivora is populated, i.e. the vicinity of Lake Victoria in East Africa, malaria is especially severe. A research study has shown that E. culicivora not only preys on Anopheles, but selects Anopheles in preference to other mosquitoes, as they can identify Anopheles by static appearance alone. When E. culicivora individuals are sated, which is usually the case in the field in East Africa where Anopheles is populated, they can single out Anopheles as preferred prey, and small E. culicivora juveniles can achieve that even when fasted. This study demonstrates that E. culicivora as an important part of the ecology, plays an important role in malaria disease control and public health, and its potential to control the disease vector is a realistic possibility. =Detection of human odor= Human odor, especially worn socks, is salient to malaria vectors and also to adults and juveniles of E. culicivora. Their detection of human odor may be less important for finding people but more important for finding the mosquitoes that carry blood of people.

After shakedown, Moose departed Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 15 March 1944 for the South Pacific. Upon arrival New Caledonia in November, she reported to Commander, Southern Pacific, for duty as a mobile floating oil storage ship. From May to August 1945 Moose served as a fuel supply ship supporting the effort to end the war against Japan, calling at Ulithi, the Palau Islands, Leyte Gulf, Okinawa, and Kerama Retto, discharging her one-millionth barrel of fuel at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 21 August.

The role of a personal assistant can be varied, such as answering phone calls, taking notes, scheduling meetings, emailing, texts, etc. In business or personal contexts, assistants are people who provide services that relieve his or her employer from the stress of tasks that are associated with managing one's personal and/or business life. They assist with a variety of life management tasks, including running errands, arranging travel (e.g., travel agent services such as purchasing airline tickets, reserving hotel rooms and rental cars, and arranging activities, as well as handling more localized services such as recommending a different route to work based on road or travel conditions), finance (paying bills, buying and selling stocks), and shopping (meal planning, remembering special occasions like birthdays). Assistants (As) often act as the manager's first point of contact with people from both inside and outside the organization. This means that their tasks and skills can often be divided into two fields of technical skills and personal skills. Tasks may include but are not limited to: * devising and maintaining office systems, including data management and filing; * arranging travel, visas and accommodation and, occasionally, travelling with the manager to take notes or dictation at meetings or to provide general assistance during presentations; * screening phone calls, inquiries and requests, and handling them when appropriate; * meeting and greeting visitors at all levels of seniority; * organizing and maintaining diaries and making appointments; * dealing with incoming email, faxes and post, often corresponding on behalf of the manager; * taking dictation and minutes; * carrying out background research and presenting findings; * producing documents, briefing papers, reports and presentations; * organizing and attending meetings and ensuring the manager is well prepared for meetings; * liaising with clients, suppliers and other staff. In addition to supporting managers, their team and departments, many PAs also have their own personal workload and responsibilities. The scope of the PA's role can be extensive and additional duties may include: * carrying out specific projects and research; * responsibility for accounts and budgets; * taking on some of the manager's responsibilities and working more closely with management; * deputizing for the manager, making decisions and delegating work to others in the manager's absence; * being involved in decision-making processes. In business-related phenomena People who cannot afford to hire their own personal assistants to run errands or answer phone calls full-time can hire a personal concierge or a part-time assistant. Most companies offer secretarial personal assistance as well as basic assistant services like research, scheduling, travel arrangements, and more. Costs of a part-time employee can end up exceeding the amount it would have cost to hire a full-time employee. Other companies charge a flat monthly fee for personal assistant services based upon the number of requests expected to be placed each month. In addition to the personal assistant services that are provided with the membership, other incentives such as local discounts, concierge services, dining recommendations, and overall knowledge and expertise may even outperform the skills of a regular personal assistant staff member. Newer personal assistant companies instead charge a monthly flat rate, which saves money. Smaller companies‚Äîespecially start-up and real estate development companies, small YouTube channels and small website owners‚Äîmay desire the services of a personal assistant to manage an individual executive, or to assist in the office as the new company goes about setting up their new business. These personal assistants may develop great skills at the birth of a new company and have opportunities for advancement. Other personal assistants will have garnered valuable knowledge and experience if they choose to move into other positions. Career development Personal assistants in the business field can be offered positions elsewhere in the company. Some are asked to consider full-time positions elsewhere in the company, depending on the level of ambition and education required/ desired. Some employers will not see the potential for a personal assistant immediately and thus the personal assistant will remain in that position until other positions become vacant. In more recent years, the celebrity personal assistant has been thrust into the spotlight. Many celebrity assistants have used the celebrity's exposure to create their own companies, like Madonna's former assistant.

It is within the former City of Etobicoke and is a relatively affluent community. The boundaries are from Dundas Street on the south to Islington Avenue to the west, Eglinton Avenue to the north, and the Humber River in the east. The neighbourhood is in the political riding of Etobicoke Centre. Character This neighbourhood can be further broken down into smaller communities. The triangular quadrant north of Dundas from Islington to Royal York, but south of Reigate is known as Chestnut Hills. The area surrounding Edenbridge, on the west side of Royal York is known as Lincoln Woods. Finally, the northern corner of Islington and Eglinton is sometimes referred to as The Greens of St. George's. Sometimes streets in the neighbourhood become their own little community as well, for example people tend to connect to names like Valecrest, North Dr, Chestnut Hills, all of which are streets in this neighbourhood. This neighbourhood is the wealthiest part of Etobicoke, and considered at par with the exclusive neighbourhoods that developed along Avenue Rd, and Yonge St, between Bloor and Highway 401. This wealth is evident in the schools. Catchment areas for schools such as Lambton-Kingsway, Humber Valley Village, Our Lady of Sorrows Elementary School, Etobicoke Collegiate Institute, and Richview Collegiate Institute are very defined. In some cases, those who do not live in the boundaries must apply with a lottery system to gain acceptance. There is also an independent elementary school, Kingsway College School, in the area, located on Dundas St. History Although laid- out in farm lots by 1805, most of the lots were purchased by some of Etobicoke's early great land owners who lived elsewhere in the township leaving this part of the Humber Valley little developed with no homes along what became Royal York Road from Dundas north to Eglinton.Atlas of the County of York, Etobicoke Township. Miles & Co., 1878 The Iroquois shoreline, remnant of the ancient Lake Iroquois, which forms an escarpment along Dundas in Etobicoke, turns far to the north in this area, cut away by the Humber River creating the Humber Valley. Robert Home Smith's estate at Edenbridge and Edenbrook, 1930 The western extension of St. Clair Avenue (now called Rathburn in Etobicoke) ran through the centre of the area and it was near this point the local developer Robert Home Smith built his home 'Edenbridge' (named after a village in southern England) overlooking the Humber Valley, at the turn of the century, after purchasing much of the surrounding land. To the west of Royal York another early resident, Frederick James, in 1908 developed his 'Red Gables' estate as a large landscaped park which, as the 'James Garden' landscaped park, remains today. While Robert Home Smith developed land in The Kingsway neighbourhood to the south, the new 'Edenbridge' area was resurveyed and subdivided for development by Smith's company more slowly as the 'Humber Valley Surveys'; construction starting in the mid 1930s and continuing after Smith's death in 1935, until the 1960s. This 30-year span produced many different styles of home as fashions changed, leading to a very different style of development than originally envisioned by Robert Home Smith. The designs include: Georgian, Colonial, Tudor, English Cottage, Cape Cod, ranch bungalows, split-level, contemporary and modernist . =Later Development= The neighbourhood was planned as a wealthy suburb like 'the Kingsway' to the south, which it has largely remained despite the later development of many apartments immediately to the west along an extended 'the Kingsway', north of Dundas to the west of Edenbridge, during Etobicoke's rapid urbanisation in the 1960s. The extension of St. Clair Avenue (Rathburn in Etobicoke) was redeveloped, in a similar style to the area in the west, as Anglesey; a winding street lined with apartments. Because Robert Home Smith had planned the, then slowly growing, area as a purely residential development, there are few institutions here. Rapid growth in Edenbridge and the higher density (north) Kingsway area to the west, necessitated the establishment of the Humber Valley Village public school, built in 1951, soon followed by the Humbertown Shopping Centre at Royal York and Dundas at the heart of 'Humber Valley Village'. The 1950s also saw the redevelopment of the Royal York and Dundas intersection as a highway style interchange, thought to be necessitated by urbanisation but now much criticised, which divided this neighbourhood from the older neighbourhoods to the south. Still mostly an exclusive and leafy neighbourhood, some recent high-density development is taking place along the short commercial stretch of Royal York in the south of the community across from the Humbertown Shopping Centre, such as the 'James Club' condominium, named after James Gardens. Parks Located in the neighbourhood, James Garden is a botanical garden managed by Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. The defining element of this community would be the parks system. Not only are there five golf courses within one kilometre of every side of the borders, but huge networks of green space surround the Humber River. This connects to the Martin Goodman Trail, which follows Lake Ontario. Lambton Woods Park is located south of the city-owned Scarlet Woods Golf Course (c. 1974) along the western banks of the Humber.http://torontofunplaces.com/component/k2/item/201-lambton-woods James Gardens is a botanical garden located north of Lambton Woods Park, and is managed by Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division.

In addition to public schools, the neighbourhood is also home to a music school and number of private schools, Kingsley Primary School, Kingsway College School, and Leonardo da Vinci Academy.

The neighbourhood is bounded by the west bank of the Humber River, west to Royal York Road and south to Eglinton Avenue West. The Humber Creek divides the area into the northern 'Humber Heights' (originally the Etobicoke side of York Township's Weston) and the southern 'Westmount' (originally part of the 'Richview' farming district) centred along Scarlett Road and La Rose Avenue. 'Richview' district (and Richview Sideroad) originated in Westmount at Scarlett Road (at the now Eglinton Avenue intersection) and its elevation in the scenic neighbourhood gave birth to the name 'rich'-'view'. Richview Sideroad was changed to Eglinton Avenue in 1970 when a 4-lane bridge was built from the east side of the Humber River to Scarlett Road in Etobicoke. This caused the morphing of Richview Sideroad with Eglinton Avenue, and the name-change. Toronto City planners had hoped to turn Richview Sideroad into The Richview Expressway to connect mid-town Toronto to the western townships down to Hamilton. Local opposition from Westmount/James Gardens/Richmond Gardens districts put up strong and influential fight to eventually kill the plan. Character The housing type varies from the 'mansions' of Yorkleigh Avenue and Westmount Park to the more modest; most are low-density single homes. A commercial stretch exists on La Rose Avenue including La Rose plaza which has many stores such as La Rose Bakery, La Rose Dollar Store, and Mel Rose Variety. La Rose Bakery is known among residents to serve excellent European food. Most of the children of the neighbourhood go to either Westmount Public School or All Saints Catholic School. The major arterial roads of the neighbourhood are Royal York Road to the west, Scarlett Road, which travels north-west to south-east through the neighbourhood and Eglinton Avenue West running east‚Äìwest to the south. Toronto Life described Humber Heights the safest neighborhood in Toronto in 2011, with the lowest crime rate of any neighborhood in the Greater Toronto Area. History View of the aftermath of Hurricane Hazel, several kilometres from Raymore Drive, where the street of houses were washed away. Originally the Etobicoke side of York Township's community (later independent town) of Weston which began on the western (Etobicoke) side, the early community (now called Humber Heights) was centred on St Philip's Anglican Church at the top of Royal York Road, one of Etobicoke's first churches.'Villages of Etobicoke', 1983 'Weston' by Marjorie Mossman, Pgs 105-109 Early settlers traveling north to Albion Township (now in Brampton) would pass through the area. A very large amount of land comprising the majority of farms lots on both banks of the Humber River between Lambton and Weston were first purchased by the Scarlett family in the 19th century.Atlas of the County of York, Etobicoke Township. Miles & Co., 1878 The first Scarlett estate, 'Runnymede' near York Township's community of Lambton, was connected by an, originally private, road (now called Scarlett Road) to the three estates owned by his sons on the Etobicoke side; the street crossing the Humber River into Etobicoke near Eglinton Avenue (then called Richview Road, a small section with this name remains). As new families, many related to the Scarletts', purchased land in the area, the Etobicoke community of 'Humbervale' appeared in the late 19th century along Scarlett Road, parallel to the Humber River, from the Humber Creek in the north to where Scarlett Road crosses over the Humber River to the south (near Eglinton and La Rose Avenues). =Development= Humbervale is best known as the site of Raymore Drive, a street washed out during Hurricane Hazel with the loss of many lives. Much low-density residential was built on former farmland as many immigrants from Italy and some eastern-European countries, settled in the rapidly urbanising Etobicoke during the 1960s. All Saints Catholic Church and St Demetrius Byzantine Catholic church and school (1975) as well as a small commercial area were established on La Rose Avenue (parallel to and just north of the long undeveloped Eglinton Avenue) to serve the growing population. The original 1858 La Rose family farm house still stands on La Rose Avenue near Islington as well as a number of other historic buildings throughout the neighbourhood. A large collection of early photographs of Humbervale became one of the largest components of Etobicoke's 'History Room' when it was established in 1985 at Richview Library.

Corvus was a pioneer of the early days of personal computers, producing the first hard disk drives, data backup, and networking devices, commonly for the Apple II series. The combination of disk storage, backup, and networking was very popular in primary and secondary education. A classroom would have a single drive and backup with a full classroom of Apple II computers networked together. Students would log in each time they use the computer and access their work. Corvus went public in 1981 and was traded on the NASDAQ exchange. The company was a modest success in the stock market during its first few years as a public company. The company's founder left Corvus in 1985 as the remaining board of directors made the decision to enter the PC clone market. D'Addio and Hahn went on to found Videonics in 1986. In 1987, the company filed for Chapter 11. Its demise was partially caused by Ethernet establishing itself over Omninet as the local area network standard for PCs, and partially by the decision to become a PC clone company in a crowded and unprofitable market space. Disk drives and backup The company hacked the Apple II DOS to enable that home computer to use 10 MB Winchester technology hard disk drives. Apple DOS normally was limited to the usage of 140 KB floppy disks. The Corvus disks not only increased the size of available storage but were also considerably faster than floppy disks. Typical usage ranged from small business and classroom management to data analysis. As an example the hard disks would be used for storing large mailing lists that could not fit on a floppy. Initial disk drives were sold to software engineers inside Apple Computer. The disk drives were manufactured by IMI (International Memories Incorporated) in Cupertino, California. Corvus provided the hardware and software to interface them to Apple II's, Tandy TRS-80s, Atari 800, and S-100 bus systems. Later, the DEC Rainbow, Corvus Concept, IBM PCs and Macs were added to the list. These 5 MB and 10 MB drives were twice the size of a shoebox and initially retailed for US$5000. Corvus sold many stand alone drives whose numbers increased as they became shared over Omninet. Corvus brought Omninet (see \\"Networking\\" below) to this product, allowing a then-very costly hard drive to be shared among multiple inexpensive Apple II computers. An entire office or classroom could thus share a single Omninet-connected Corvus drive. Certain models of the drives offered a tape backup option called \\"Mirror\\" to make hard disk backups using a VCR, which was itself a relatively new technology. A standalone version of \\"Mirror\\" was also made available. Data was backed up at roughly one megabyte per minute which resulted in five or ten-minute backup times. Tapes could hold up to 73MB. Even though Corvus had a on this technology, several other computer companies later used this technique. A later version of tape backup for the Corvus Omninet was called \\"The Bank\\" and was a standalone Omninet connected device that used custom backup tape media that were very similar in shape and size to today's DLT tapes. Both the Corvus File Server and The Bank tape backup units were in white plastic housings roughly the size of two stacked reams of paper. Networking In 1980 Corvus came out with the first commercially successful local area network (LAN), called Omninet. Most Ethernet deployments of the time ran at 3 Mbit/s and cost one or two thousand dollars per computer. Ethernet also used a thick and heavy cable that felt like a lead pipe when bent, which was run in proximity to each computer, often in the ceiling plenum. The weight of the cable was such that injury to workers from ceiling failure and falling cables was a real danger. A transceiver unit was spliced or tapped into the cable for each computer, with an additional AUI cable running from the transceiver to the computer itself. Corvus's Omninet ran at one megabit per second, used twisted pair cables and had a simple add-in card for each computer. The card cost $400 and could be installed by the end user. Cards and operating software were produced for both the Apple II and the IBM PC and XT. At the time, many networking experts said that twisted pair could never work because \\"the bits would leak off\\", but it eventually became the de facto standard for wired LANs. Other Omninet devices included the \\"Utility Server\\" that was an Omninet connected device that allowed one Parallel printer and two Serial devices (usually printers) connected to it to be shared on an Omninet network. Internally the Utility Server was a single-board Z80 computer with 64 kB of RAM, and on startup the internal boot ROM retrieved its operating program from the File Server. The literature/documentation and software that shipped with the Utility Server included a memory map and I/O ports writeup. It was possible to replace the Utility Server's operating code file with a stand-alone copy of Wordstar configured for the serial port, and to fetch and save its files on the file server. A dumb terminal connected to the first serial port then became an inexpensive diskless word processing station. A single Omninet was limited to 64 devices, and the device address was set with a 5-bit DIP switch. Device zero was the first file server, device one was the Mirror or The Bank tape backup, the rest were user computers, or Utility Servers. Systems with more than one file server had them at zero and up, then the tape backup, then the user computers. No matter what the configuration, you could only have 64 devices. Corvus Concept In April 1982, Corvus launched a computer called the Corvus Concept. This was a Motorola 68000-based computer in a pizza-box case with a 15\\" full page display mounted on its top, the first that could be rotated between landscape and portrait modes. Changing display orientation did not require rebooting the computer - it was all automatic and seamless and selected by a mercury switch inside the monitor shell. The screen resolution was 720√ó560 pixels. Positioned vertically, the monitor displayed 72 rows by 91 columns of text; the horizontal resolution was 56 rows by 120 columns. The first version of the Concept came with 256 kB standard, and expanding the RAM to its maximum supported capacity of 1MB cost $995 at the time. The Concept was capable of using more RAM, and a simple hack provided up to 4MB. The failure of the Concept was mostly related to its lack of compatibility with the IBM PC, introduced the previous August. The Concept interface, though not a GUI, was a standardized text user interface that made heavy use of function keys. Application programs could contextually redefine these keys, and the current command performed by each key was displayed on a persistent status line at the bottom of the screen. The function keys were placed on the top row of the keyboard close to their onscreen representation. A crude \\"Paint\\" program was available for $395 that permitted a user to create simple bitmap graphics. These could be pasted into Corvus' word processing program called \\"Edword\\", which was quite powerful by the standards of the day; it was judged to be worth the cost of the system by itself. The operating system, called CCOS, was prompt driven, communicating with the user using full sentences such as \`Copy which file(s)?\` when the \\"Copy file\\" function key was pressed. The user would respond by typing the path of the file to be copied. The OS would then prompt for a destination path. Wildcard pattern matching was supporting using the * and ? characters. The OS supported pipes and \\"Exec files\\", which were similar to shell scripts. Versions of the Concept running Unix were available; these configurations could not run standard Concept software. The UCSD p-System was available, and a Pascal compiler was available supporting most UCSD extensions FORTRAN was also standard. Built-in BASIC was also an option, enabling the computer to boot without a disk attached. A software CP/M emulator was available from Corvus, but it was of limited usefulness since it only emulated 8080 instructions and not the more-common Z80-specific instructions. Wesleyan University ported the KERMIT file transfer protocol. The entire motherboard could slide out of the back of the cabinet for easy access to perform upgrades and repairs. The system was equipped with four 50-pin Apple II bus compatible slots for expansion cards. External 5.25\\" and 8\\" floppy disk drive peripherals (made by Fujitsu) were available for the Concept. The 8\\" drive had a formatted capacity of 250kB. The 5.25\\" drive was read-only, and disks held 140kB. The video card was integrated in the monitor's update circuitry. The system had a battery-backed hardware clock that stored the date and month, but not the year. There was a leap year switch that set February to have 29 days. The system had a built in Omninet port on it. The system could boot from a locally connected floppy disk or Corvus Hard Drive or it could be booted over the Omninet network. In 1984, the base 256K system cost $3995 with monitor and keyboard and bundled Edword word processor. The floppy drive cost an additional $750. Hard drives from 6MB ($2195) to 20MB ($3995) were also available (SCSI I on some). A software bundle containing ISYS integrated spreadsheet, graphing, word processing, and communication software cost $495. The hardware necessary for networking cost $495 per workstation. The Concept Unix workstation came with 512K and cost $4295 for the Concept Uniplex that can be expanded to two users and $5995 for the Concept Plus that can service eight users. The Concept was available as part of turnkey systems from OEMs, such as the Oklahoma Seismic Corporation Mira for oil well exploration, and the KeyText Systems BookWare for publishing.

The term poker room is used to describe a dedicated room in casinos that is dedicated to playing poker and in function is similar to a card room. Such rooms typically do not offer slot machines or video poker, or other table games such as craps or roulette as found in casinos. However, a casino will often use the term \\"cardroom\\" or \\"poker room\\" (usually the latter) to refer to a separate room that offers card games where players typically compete against each other, instead of against \\"the house\\". Overview In the United States, stand-alone cardrooms are typically the result of local or state laws and regulations, which often prohibit full- fledged casino gambling. This was typically the case in California until the advent of casino gambling offered by Native American tribes in the 1990s, though card rooms continue to flourish and even expand there. Since games played in card rooms are usually player-against-player instead of player- against-house, card room operators typically derive their revenues in one of two ways. In most, the dealer of each game (employed by the establishment) will collect a rake, a portion of the pot from each hand. At other times, a charge will be levied against each player for a specific time period, typically each half-hour. Though traditional poker variants such as Texas hold 'em, Omaha hold 'em and seven-card stud are by far the most popular games offered by card rooms (and sometimes the only games), others may offer games such as panguingue, pai gow, Chinese poker, and variations on blackjack.TheBike.com: Casino games These so-called \\"California games\\", or \\"Asian games\\", may resemble such traditional casino games as blackjack, baccarat and even craps, but have rules that comply with various state restrictions. Most U.S. stand-alone card rooms are located in Montana, with more than two hundred such clubs licensed in 2013, and over four hundred licensed nationally. California has the second most such clubs, with 88 such clubs as of 2013. California card rooms like the California Grand Casino date back to the 1850s. Some are modest establishments with just a few tables, while others are the largest poker rooms in the world, offering as much as five times as many tables as the largest Las Vegas cardroom. Some even call themselves \\"casinos\\", even though their lack of electronic and table games would normally disqualify the use of such a term by modern standards. Hollywood Park Casino, a casino located near and formerly part of Hollywood Park Racetrack, a former Thoroughbred race track in Inglewood, California, has an elaborate card room on its premises.

It is also the location of its spiritual temple, called The Ecclesia, situated upon the promontory of a high mesa overlooking the San Luis Rey River Valley and the Franciscan Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. On April 7, 1995, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Rosicrucian Fellowship Temple. Construction =The vision= 3rd Natal Chart of The Rosicrucian Fellowship at Mount Ecclesia (1911) Mount Ecclesia was founded after one of the Elder Brothers of the Rose Cross known as \\"The Teacher\\" suggested to Max Heindel, Founder of the Rosicrucian Fellowship (8/08/1909), that permanent headquarters be established to support the twin mission of the Organization: to spread the Rosicrucian teachings, (the deeper Esoteric Christian Mysteries); and to heal the sick (according to the spiritual method delineated by the Order of the Rose Cross). On the winter solstice of 1910 The Teacher gave Max Heindel a spiritual vision of the location through \\"Jupiter Consciousness/picture consciousness/spiritual vision/telepathy\\" with the mission to find it and start the work. =Finding the location= After months of unfruitful search along the pacific coast between Los Angeles and San Diego California, the Heindels decided, on April 30, 1911, to go visit the famous Franciscan Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, founded in 1798 in Oceanside by Junipero Serra the Franciscan friar from Spain. On their way there, by horse and buggy, they stumbled on the location matching the vision given earlier by The Teacher and discovered that the land was for sale. Mr. Heindel interrupted the trip to the Franciscan mission to return to the real estate office to buy the land. But the sign on the real estate office door said \\"Office closed to reopen on Wednesday May 3\\". On May 3, 1911 they returned with their friend Mr. Patterson to Oceanside to buy the land. Shortly after 3.00 pm (at 3.05 pm) Mr. Heindel signed the deed of purchase and secured it with a down payment. They went home to Ocean Park and the same evening Mr. Heindel named the property Mount Ecclesia. =Groundbreaking= C.R.C., the Founders' Cross, there were reported three invisible leaders, beyond the stage of ordinary humanity, and nine members of the Rosicrucian Fellowship. The Teacher later suggested to Max Heindel that the Founders' Cross be changed to white in order to avoid unfortunate associations. It took them six months to get ready to leave their cottage in Ocean Park. They finally came down to fellowship's new headquarters on the 40 acres (about 16.19 hectares) land of Mount Ecclesia to dedicate it to the \\"Great Work of the Elder Brothers of the Rose Cross\\". The dedication ceremony was planned for 12.40 PM on October 28, 1911 in Oceanside California. Mount Ecclesia was launched that day, through a ceremony of ground-breaking which consisted in planting a large Cross with the initials C.R.C. ‚Äî representing the symbolical name Christian Rose Cross, who is the Head of the Order of the Rose Cross (Rosicrucian Order) ‚Äî painted in gilt letters on the trefoils of the three upper arms and with a climbing rose. An excerpt of the first hand description of the mentioned event is as following : =Construction of The Ecclesia= The Ecclesia, the Healing Temple, was erected, for the purpose of affording more powerful means for the healing of disease, and dedicated on December 25, 1920. The project for the building of the Temple had started in 1914. Heindel, who died in 1919, didn't live to see the Temple completed in 1920. His wife, Agusta Foss Heindel, remained active in civic engagement, promoting the Fellowship and working to beautify Oceanside until her death in 1949. Spiritual Healing meetings are held in this holy place at a regular time each day by the Probationers who have consecrated their lives to this work. The architect of the building was Lester A. Cramer. As in all the solar temples, The Ecclesia portal is facing east (the rising sun). In front of the portal stand two palm trees. The portal is constituted by a triangular-shaped pediment upon two round columns. At the centre of the pediment, there is an equilateral triangle, symbol of Trinity, inscribed by \\"the eye of God.\\" The columns fuse Greek (Ionic, Doric and Corinthian) and Roman (Tuscan and composite) styles, each one with a capital crowned by a finial globe. There are three steps between the columns leading to the Temple entrance. At the Temple entrance there are two square pilasters, each showing two faces. The round 12-sided building architecture is composed by round arches and narrow round inward windows. Its great dome is composed by a cupola crowned by a golden globe with a finial of lights. The inner portal and the Temple's interior is ornamented with alchemical and astrological symbols. It is a solar temple dedicated to the coming Age of Aquarius. On June 29, 1920 (from 11:55 A. M. until 12:02 P. M.), the vision of an event of Spiritual nature at ground's site was reported as following: On July 23, 1920 (at noon), during the laying of the cornerstone in the north-eastern corner of the temple, the purpose of The Ecclesia was stated in accordance to the commands of Christ, namely, \\"Preach the gospel and heal the sick\\": Spiritual and healing services Nearly since its inception the Fellowship has been providing the service of spiritual healing; the first service took place on June 23, 1914.

Currently, the healing applications are received by the Fellowship's centers worldwide or directly by the healing department at Mount Ecclesia.The Healing Work. TRF website (accessed on February 7, 2017) Over the years, the group built a number of structures on the property, including an administration building in 1913, a chapel in 1914, a guesthouse and healing center in 1938, and a business office and cottages in the 1960s and 1970s. Max Heindel, the founder of the Rosicrucian Fellowship, had a dream, yet to be concretized, of a beautiful Grecian theatre envisioned to be built in the canyon below the Chapel and in which performances would be given of plays with a spiritual message and occult truths such as the great dramas of ShakespeareShakespeare  The Lay Bible. Idem and other inspired classics; as well as of the Fellowship's own splendid orchestra composed of permanent students, that it would perform in the theatre works of master composers, particularly those of Beethoven and Wagner whom he knew to be high musical Initiates, and also that classes in initiatory music would be taught there.

Financial model The Rosicrucian Fellowship observes the basic condition, set by its founder Max Heindel, that no price, membership dues or fees, should be put on its teachings, and never to ask for money for membership, for information, for education, nor for healing. The Fellowship has always balanced along the edge of the subsistence level with its funding and maintenance being achieved through the voluntary giving of members and friends, legacies, book-sale profits, housing rentals and cafeteria income and with the assistance of volunteer workers. By setting the example and through self-discipline, Mount Ecclesia seeks : ¬´to unite and harmonize each with the others by teaching a religion that is both scientific and artistic, and to gather all churches into one great Christian Brotherhood.¬ª The Rosicrucians do not seek temporal power. They seek to serve God by helping their suffering fellowmen. A place of training for the work is beautifully attained in Mount Ecclesia, and now THE ECCLESIA, the TEMPLE OF HEALING, is being built by the loving free-will offerings of friends who give not money alone but personal service and prayers. This method of building is a little new and somewhat slow in these days, as it is not permitted to call out to the world for funds or labor. Each offering must come as a result of the inner promptings of the HEART.

It is bordered by Westwood Park to the south, Saint Francis Wood to the west, Sherwood Forest to the north, and Sunnyside to the east. Mt. Davidson, the highest point in San Francisco, lays just northeast. Westwood Highlands covers an area of 0.178 square miles, with a population of 1,782 as of 2009. The median household income in Westwood Highlands is $116,573, compared to a median of $70,770 for the city of San Francisco. Westwood Highlands is a small, private subdivision development comprising 283 homes built between 1925 and 1929. The subdivision is bound by five intersecting arterial roads. Westwood Highlands was one of the first residential communities in the United States to agree to a set of covenants and restrictions History In 1906, San Francisco was shaken by one of the most damaging earthquakes in the history of America, followed by subsequent fires that enveloped the city and caused further destruction. Developers and planners alike used the aftermath as a catalyst for redevelopment. This redevelopment saw previously barren farmland, such as the area around Twin Peaks, being turned into low- to medium-density residential housing. In 1918, the Twin Peaks Tunnel was opened, facilitating the construction of new suburbs and development. Muni Metro ran comprehensive train services through the tunnel that led out to the surrounding regions, including West Portal and Ingleside Terraces, allowing the public to finally gain easy access to the area. The tunnel also reduced travel time into downtown San Francisco dramatically, from almost an hour down to just twenty minutes; from this, the notion of the commuter suburb was born. The realtors of Westwood Highlands were the well-established Baldwin and Howell Company, known for their emphasis on improving and integrating communities through design and layout. Working in correlation with a builder, Hans Nelson, and an architect, Charles Strothoff, Baldwin and Howell designed this commuter suburb with the intention of harvesting \\"efficient and economical design‚Ä¶ for a middle-class market.\\" Unlike surrounding neighborhoods that boasted an eclectic mix of architectural styles, the houses of Westwood Highlands were built according to specific design parameters that ensured cohesion and unity throughout the subdivision. Planning considerations In the planning of Westwood Highlands, careful consideration was given to the public fa√ßade of houses. Strothoff based the housing stock on the modular system of design that allowed for interchangeable components to be added or subtracted. The principle of modules allowed units to be configured in different ways; Strothoff utilized three interchangeable modules: the window, entrance, and garage. Generally, most dwellings conformed to three-module configurations that allowed for the greatest variation in the street; however two- and four-module houses were not uncommon. From the streetscape, this system provided both unity and diversity: each house could conform to various configurations without essentially altering the overall design character of the neighborhood. This ensured that not only the design elements were regulated, but also the overall appearance of the streets. The elevation and natural topography of Westwood Highlands was used to its advantage. In contrast to the rest of San Francisco, which was dominated by the grid organization, Westwood Highlands adopted the system of curvilinear streets, which naturally fitted the steep environment. Corner lots had a dual purpose in both complementing the curvilinear streets and binding the community neighborhood. The corner block provided a private-public relationship with the intersection. In the planning of Westwood Highlands, corner lots were designed to ensure they faced the street intersection on the diagonal. It was used as a systematic means of ‚Äòsoftening ‚Äò the relationship between the public streets and the private nature of the houses suggesting a more open neighborhood community. Another important consideration in the planning of Westwood Highlands was the hierarchy of streets and lots. In previous subdevelopments in surrounding areas such as Westwood Park and Saint Francis Wood, lots were sold as empty parcels of land in which private owners could develop as they wished. In Westwood Highlands, lots were marketed and sold as a complete package, with a predetermined existing designed house. Again, the topography was highly influential in determining the value of each lot. Dwellings on steeper gradients generally had smaller lots (and subsequently smaller houses) with picturesque views of the city, while larger lots had more affordable houses and were generally located on the outer- eastern boundaries of the development. Influences While Westwood Highlands was partly an instinctive response to the 1906 earthquake disaster, it was also a reaction to the increasing population trends of the time. This private development movement had many influences on town planning, and Westwood Highlands established some important influences on the private development planning in the United States. Firstly, in relation to planning and practice, Baldwin and Howell, as mentioned previously, were marketing lots in Westwood Highlands as complete packages and in doing so promoting a lifestyle that was community centric, affordable, and livable. The notion of middle-class residential living was also a large trademark in the promotion of the area. The Real Estate Associates, founded by real estate mogul William Hollis in 1886, became one of the largest developers in the late nineteenth century. They set guidelines for the development of housing lots in the San Francisco Bay Area. Some guidelines were infused into the planning and development of the Westwood Highlands, such as the notion of wealth organization and spatial hierarchy. The controls over design and layout of the houses resembled the contemporary planning restrictions of today, and it was through these covenants that social control in the 1920s was regulated in the public domain. It appears that the role of the realtor in the early twentieth century was not only to develop but to also be responsible for social reconstruction and order. Westwood Highlands is the archetype of private planning practices in America in the early to mid-twentieth century. Through advocating the suburban lifestyle and the benefits of living in highly controlled and planned communities, Baldwin and Howell forged influential planning practices still evident in the considerations of contemporary planning today.

Early life Strauss was the son of the Conservative (and previously a Liberal Unionist) MP Arthur Strauss (1847‚Äì1920), who later joined the Labour Party. George Strauss was educated at Rugby School, where the hostile treatment experienced by him and other Jewish boys left him as a vehement supporter of racial equality. He became a metal merchant and a leading member of the London County Council, on which his wife Patricia also served. Political career Strauss' first parliamentary contest was in Lambeth North in 1924, when he lost by just 29 votes; however, he gained the seat in 1929. He lost it in Labour's landslide defeat of 1931, but regained it in a 1934 by- election. In 1939 Strauss was expelled from the Labour Party for seven months for supporting the 'Popular Front' movement of Stafford Cripps, whom he had served as Parliamentary Private Secretary. Strauss was parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Transport 1945‚Äì47 and was the Minister of Supply from 1947 to 1951. After boundary changes, he became MP for Vauxhall in 1950, which he represented until 1979. On 9 July 1979 he was created a life peer as Baron Strauss, of Vauxhall in the London Borough of Lambeth.

Two antenna leads on the turret roof and two-colour camouflage of the vehicle are visible. Karelian Isthmus, February 1940. Teletanks were a series of wireless remotely controlled unmanned tanks produced in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and early 1940s so as to reduce combat risk to soldiers. They saw their first combat use in the Winter War, at the start of World War II. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500‚Äì1,500 metres, the two constituting a telemechanical group. Teletanks were used by the Soviet Red Army in the Winter War, fielding at least two teletank battalions at the beginning of the World War II on Eastern Front.  Design  Teletanks were equipped with DT machine guns, flamethrowers, smoke canisters, and sometimes a special 200‚Äì700 kg time bomb in an armoured box, dropped by the tank near the enemy's fortifications and used to destroy bunkers up to four levels below ground. Teletanks were also designed to be capable of using chemical weapons, although they were not used in combat. Each teletank, depending on its model, was able to recognize sixteen to twenty-four different commands sent via radio on two possible frequencies to avoid interference and jamming. Teletanks were built based on T-18, T-26, T-38, BT-5 and BT-7 tanks. Standard tactics were for the TU control tank (with radio transmitter and operator) to stay back as far as practicable while the teletank (TT) approached the enemy.

May 2014Tod Ensign (paid death notice), New York Times, May 30, 2014. Accessed online 2014-07-21.) was an American veterans' rights lawyer and Director of Citizen Soldier, a non-profit GI and veterans rights advocacy group based in New York City. Ensign held two law degrees, a Master of Laws (LLM) from NYU and Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Wayne State University, as well as a BA from Michigan State University. Veteran's rights activism Ensign co- founded Citizen Soldier in 1969 to advocate on behalf of GIs and veterans who work to oppose command-tolerated racism, sexism, homophobia and militarism. Currently, the group has 7,500 members nationwide, who provide nearly all of its financial support. As an attorney, Ensign has participated in a broad range of legal cases involving GIs and veterans over the past 35 years. Two notable cases are the Agent Orange class action, which attempted to hold chemical manufacturers liable for the injuries their herbicide caused Vietnam veterans and their offspring and the Vietnam-Era Winter Soldier Investigation and National Veterans Inquiry. Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Citizen Soldier attorneys, including Ensign, counseled hundreds of GIs and reservists seeking alternatives to serving in what many regard as an illegal war. The most celebrated case was Citizen Soldier's defense of Sgt. Camilo Mejia, 28 of Miami, Florida. Mejia was the first US combat veteran to refuse further service in Iraq. He based his refusal on his duty, on international law, that it is illegal to obey military orders that violate international law. During his five months in Iraq, he claims he witnessed command-sanctioned shooting of civilians, abuse of detainees and other violations. Mejia‚Äôs defense team has appealed the military judge‚Äôs refusal to allow any expert testimony at his court martial regarding illegal US military operations by his unit. Ensign founded The Different Drummer coffeehouse near Watertown, NY, which strove to connect and inform service members. Beginning in 2000, Ensign served on the executive board of the National Gulf War Resource Center, a coalition of Gulf War advocacy groups that advocates for research and health care for veterans from both Gulf wars. (He was the only non-veteran serving on this board). Publications Ensign was author of two books, Military Life: The Insider's Guide (Prentice Hall, 2000) and America's Military Today: The Challenge of Militarism (New Press, 2004). He was coauthor of GI Guinea Pigs (Playboy, 1980) the first expos√© of how US soldiers were harmed by nuclear fallout during A-bomb tests and the herbicide Agent Orange that was used during the Vietnam War. He also contributed chapters to four other books, Ten Excellent Reasons Not to Join the Military (New Press, 2006) Against the Vietnam War: Writings by Activists (Syracuse U. Press, 1999), Metal of Dishonor: Depleted Uranium (IAC Press, 1997) Collateral Damage (South Press. He has written dozens of articles for The Progressive, In These Times, Radical America, The American Pathologist, The N. Y. Daily News, Toward Freedom, Against the Current, the Weekly Guardian, the Non Violent Resister, the Indypendent, and several others. He had one daughter.

Playland Park opened in 1943 and was owned by Jimmy Johnson. Prior to this it operated as a small venue at Brackenridge Park ca. 1942. It was the original home of The Rocket, a popular wooden roller coaster. Ed Gaida, who lived at Playland Park and had access to records and archives, wrote a book about the park and Johnson. Playland Park of San Antonio, Texas should not be confused with Playland Park of Houston, Texas which operated around the same time and had a wooden roller coaster similarly named \\"The Skyrocket.\\" These two parks operated independently of each other. Playland Park closed on Labor Day September 1, 1980. For several decades, the original \\"Playland\\" sign stood at the original gate, the last remnant of the park. Today, the location is a campus of the Alamo Community College District and no trace remains of the original park. Since its closure, a new theme park, Six Flags Fiesta Texas (Originally simply called Fiesta Texas) has been San Antonio's main amusement destination. The Rocket The Rocket was designed and built by Herb Schmeck and the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The roller coaster operated from 1947 until the park's closure in 1980. Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, Pennsylvania purchased the ride in 1984 and dismantled it in early 1985. As there were no blueprints to work with, each individual board was numbered and cataloged on site. The restored roller coaster opened at Knoebels on June 15, 1985, as The Phoenix.

McCracken Tribunal Judge McCracken was appointed as the sole member of the McCracken Tribunal which was set up by the Bruton Government in February 1997 to investigate reports of secret payments by Ben Dunne to former Taoiseach Charles Haughey and former cabinet Minister Michael Lowry and others. The Tribunal heard evidence in July 1997 and produced a 100-page report the following month. This report found that Haughey had given untrue evidence under oath and that Lowry was knowingly assisted by Dunne in evading tax. As a result of the findings and revelation of substantial funds in secret Ansbacher accounts, owned by Haughey, the new Ahern Government established a more extensive follow-up, the Moriarty Tribunal to investigate the financial affairs of the two politicians.

Improvements and expansions include construction of the community's on-campus Symons Recreation Complex in 1987, Campus View student housing in 1987, expanded in 1988 and 1999, renovation and expansion of Melvill Hall in 1998, and Science Hall in 2001. East Hall, a former county building adjacent to the campus, was renovated and became the newest UW-Richland building in 2010. History Known today as the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville Richland, the present campus opened in 1967 as the Richland Branch Campus of the Wisconsin State University-Platteville (now known as the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville). With the 1972 merger of the University of Wisconsin and State University Systems, the campus became part of the University of Wisconsin Center System and was known as UW Center- Richland. In 1997, the name of the institution was changed to the University of Wisconsin Colleges and the campus name to UW‚ÄìRichland. In July 2018, the UW Colleges system was restructured, and UW‚ÄìRichland again became a satellite campus of UW‚ÄìPlatteville. In August 2018, the name was changed to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville Richland. Academics The campus offers an array of courses to begin any of more than 200 majors. Many UW‚ÄìRichland students mark completion of the first half of a bachelor's degree by earning the Associate of Arts and Science degree or use the Guaranteed Transfer Program, under which students are guaranteed admission to a four-year University of Wisconsin System campus of their choice if they meet certain academic requirements. Special programs Since the mid-1980s, UW‚ÄìRichland has been a partner in several international programs, bringing students from around the world to Richland Center to live and learn. An array of activities enhances outside-the-classroom learning and includes Student Senate/student government, Phi Theta Kappa honor society, International Club, Student Wisconsin Education Association chapter Educators of the Future and more.

Quarterback at Ohio State Born in Massillon, Ohio, Sparma attended Ohio State University and played quarterback on the 1961 and 1962 football teams coached by Woody Hayes. Sparma and his leading receiver, Paul Warfield, led the 1961 Buckeyes to an 8-0-1 season and a Big Ten Conference championship Sparma accounted for 474 yards in the Buckeyes' 1961 50-20 victory over the Michigan Wolverines. Sparma quit the team after three years due to differences with Hayes and opted to pursue a career in Major League Baseball. Major League Baseball pitcher Sparma received a $32,000 bonus to sign with the Detroit Tigers in 1963. He played six seasons with Detroit, from 1964-1969. In 1965, Sparma was in his first full season with the Tigers, when he was assigned to be the starting pitcher against the Yankees on \\"Mickey Mantle Day\\" in New York. When Mantle came to bat for the first time in the game, Sparma walked off the mound, approached Mantle, and said: \\"You know, I've never had a chance to meet you in person, and I've always admired you.\\" Sparma and Mantle shook hands, and Sparma went back to the mound and struck Mantle out. Mantle turned to Detroit's catcher Bill Freehan and said: \\"They have a day for me and your manager's got to put some hard-throwing kid out there. Couldn't he have put in some soft-tossing left-hander for me to hit off of, so I could look like a hero in front of all those people?\\" (Bill Freehan, \\"Behind the Mask\\" (1970), pp. 7‚Äì8) Sparma's best season was 1967, when he posted a record of 16-9 with 11 complete games, five shutouts, and a 3.76 ERA. In 1968, Sparma lost his spot in the rotation after a run-in with manager Mayo Smith. Sparma was pulled from a game and told Detroit sportswriter Joe Falls that Smith \\"had no respect for him; didn't like him, didn't trust him, etc., etc.\\" When Falls asked Smith for a response, Smith said he \\"didn't want to get into a spitting contest with a skunk.\\" (Joe Falls, Joe Falls 50 Years of Sports Writing (Sports Publishing 1997), p. 159.) Smith refused to start Sparma for several weeks afterward. When Sparma finally got another start on September 17, he pitched a one-run, complete game win against the Yankees to clinch the Tigers' first pennant since 1945. The Sparma-Smith feud continued, and Sparma pitched only 1/3 of an inning in the 1968 World Series, giving up two earned runs for a 54.00 ERA in postseason play. On May 31, 1969, Sparma lost a no-hitter against the Seattle Pilots when Don Mincher doubled with one out in the ninth inning.He was out there, awhile During the 1969 season, Sparma roomed with Freehan, as Freehan kept a diary that was published in 1970. In the book, Freehan wrote that Sparma and Smith were usually not even on speaking terms as Sparma remained in Smith's doghouse. Freehan also wrote memorably of Sparma's talent for ESP: \\"My roomie's got an ESP thing. Every now and then, he'll wake up on a morning he's supposed to pitch and say, 'I've got a good feeling. I know we're going to win.' Joe doesn't get this feeling too often, but every time he does  every single time  we win.\\" (Freehan, \\"Behind the Mask,\\" p. 104) Sparma had that \\"good feeling\\" on June 13, 1969, before he shut out the Royals, 6-0. On another occasion, Sparma told teammate Dick McAuliffe of a premonition: \\"Mac, I know you're going to have a good day today. Something just tells me you're going to go three for five.\\" McAuliffe went 3-for-4 in his first 4 at-bats and struck out in his 5th at bat. When he came back to the dugout, McAuliffe blamed Sparma for jinxing him on the 5th at bat. In his book, Freehan wrote that McAuliffe was \\"actually angry\\" at Sparma. \\"He could've at least thanked Joe for the three hits.\\" (Freehan, \\"Behind the Mask,\\" p. 106) Toward the end of the 1969 season, Sparma got into a fight in the bullpen with Fred Lasher. On December 3, 1969, Sparma was traded to the Montreal Expos. Sparma pitched only 27 innings for the Expos in 1970, compiling a record of 0-4. Sparma pitched his last major league game on May 12, 1970. In 183 career games, he had a 52-52 record with a 3.94 ERA. Sparma died in Columbus, Ohio at age 44 in 1986, after suffering a heart attack and undergoing heart bypass surgery.Joe Sparma References External linksJoe Sparma at Baseball Library *Joe Sparma at The Deadball Era *Joe Sparma New York Times Obituary Category:1942 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Massillon, Ohio Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Ohio State Buckeyes baseball players Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football players Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Montreal Expos players Category:Duluth-Superior Dukes players Category:Knoxville Smokies players Category:Winnipeg Whips players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players ","title":"Joe Sparma"},{"id":"5978933","text":"Eduard Hauser (born 26 November 1948) is a former Swiss cross-country skier who competed in the early 1970s.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Novi Beograd, in the Syrmia region.  Location  Be≈æanija blocks Be≈æanijska Kosa Be≈æanija is located west of the downtown Belgrade, across the Sava river, in the Syrmia region. It is situated in the central part of the Novi Beograd municipality, on the southern extension of the elongated, crescent-shaped yellow loess ridge of Be≈æanijska kosa. The ridge (or slope, as it is called in Serbian, kosa) gives its name to the northern extension of Be≈æanija, Be≈æanijska Kosa, and stretches to the right banks of the Danube in the neighborhood of Zemun. Once a suburb of Belgrade, separated from it by the vast marshlands on the Sava's left bank, Be≈æanija today forms one completely urbanized area with Belgrade thanks to the rapid development of Novi Beograd after World War II. Today, Be≈æanija extends to the northeast into Be≈æanijska kosa and the west into Ledine. Administration After the World War II ended, Belgrade was divided into raions and Be≈æanija was part of the Raion X. When this division was abolished in 1952, Be≈æanija became a municipality. In 1955 it was annexed to the municipality of New Belgrade, but remained as the separate settlement until 1971, when it became a local community (Serbian: mesna zajednica within Belgrade. In the 1990s, local community was administratively divided into Be≈æanija and Be≈æanijska Kosa.  Population  Be≈æanija experienced a rapid growth of population after 1948 as it was almost immediately attached to the newly constructed city-within-the city of Novi Beograd. As internal communal boundaries changed a lot since the 1970s, despite further expansion, censuses showed a reduced number of population as many border areas (entirely or partially) were detached from Be≈æanija (Be≈æanijska kosa, blocks 61-65, etc.). Historical population of Be≈æanija (1921-61 as the separate settlement, 1971-81 as a local community, 2002-11 as local communities of Be≈æanija and Be≈æanijska kosa): * 1921 - 2,069 * 1953 - 3,330 * 1961 - 7,129 * 1971 - 15,580 * 1981 - 14,067 * 2002 - 32,416 * 2011 - 38,204  History  Be≈æanija is the oldest part of today's Novi Beograd, where a settlement existed from the neolithic to the Roman period. The remains belonging to the Scordisci, a Celtic tribe which founded Singidunum and Taurunum, the predecessors of Belgrade and Zemun, respectively, were found in Be≈æanija. In the book Kru≈°evski pomenik from 1713, which was kept in the Dobrun monastery near Vi≈°egrad, settlement of Be≈æanija was mentioned for the first time under its present name as far as 1512, as a small village with 32 houses, populated by Serbs. In this time, the village was under the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and was part of the Syrmia County. The inhabitants of the village crossed the Sava river and settled in Syrmia after fleeing the fall of the medieval Serbian Despotate under the hands of the Ottoman Empire (hence the name be≈æanija, \\"refugee camp\\" in archaic Serbian). Kru≈°evski pomenik was later transferred to the National Library of Serbia and perished during the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. An old German map of the Syrmia, shows a village south of Zemun called Verschania. In 1521, the village became part of the Ottoman Empire. From 1527 to 1530, Be≈æanija was part of Radoslav ƒåelnik's Duchy of Syrmia, an Ottoman vassal, until its subsequent organization into the Ottoman Sanjak of Syrmia. The Habsburg Monarchy conquered it temporarily during the Great Turkish War (1689-1691), but it remained under Ottoman administration by the provisions of the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, until 1718. In 1718, the village became part of the Habsburg Monarchy and was placed under military administration. It was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier (Petrovaradin regiment of Slavonian Krajina). During the 17th and 18th centuries, hunger and constant Turkish intrusions devastated the village, but it was constantly being repopulated by the refugees from central Serbia. In 1810, population census counted 115, mostly Serbian households. By the 1850s, Austrians colonized a large number of Germans in Be≈æanija. In 1848-1849 it was part of the Serbian Vojvodina, an ethnic Serb autonomous region within the Austrian Empire, but in 1849 was again placed under administration of the Military Frontier. Old map from 1910, showing settlements in eastern Syrmia, including Be≈æanija As the Frontier was abolished in 1881-1882, it became part of the Syrmia County within the autonomous Habsburg kingdom Croatia-Slavonia, which was located within the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. In 1910, the largest ethnic group in the village were Serbs, while other sizable ethnic groups were Germans, Hungarians and Croats. After dissolution of Austria-Hungary, in autumn of 1918, Be≈æanija became part of the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On November 24, 1918, as part of Syrmia region, the village became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, and on December 1, it became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (future Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia County and from 1922 to 1929 part of the Syrmia Oblast. Be≈æanija became part of the wider Belgrade area for the first time in 1929 after coup d'√©tat conducted by the king Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who, among other things, draw a new map of Yugoslavia's administrative division creating a new administrative unit Uprava grada Beograda or Administration of the City of Belgrade which comprised Belgrade, Zemun (with Be≈æanija) and Panƒçevo. Administrative area of the village of Be≈æanija was quite large at the time, stretching to the King Alexander Bridge, which was a dividing point between Be≈æanija and Zemun. It means it encompassed of what would be 2/3 of the area of modern New Belgrade. During World War II, from 1941 to 1944, the village was occupied by the Axis Powers and was attached to the Paveliƒá's Independent State of Croatia. After World War II, Be≈æanija became part of new socialist Serbia within restored Yugoslavia. It remained part of the Belgrade area but with its own municipality. As the construction of Novi Beograd began in 1948, municipality of Be≈æanija was abolished an annexed to the municipality of Novi Beograd in 1955 (itself established in 1952), becoming one of its local communities.  Economy  Be≈æanija is mostly residential area. Some very important industrial facilities are located in the areas geographically, though not administratively, parts of Be≈æanija: IMT and FOM factories, section of the Belgrade's Waterwoks and Sewage, Minel, etc. Commercial sector is developing recently, including a green market, several gas pumps, a stadium and several shopping malls (like Immo Idea). The major transmission grid's substation for western Belgrade is located in Be≈æanija and was heavily damaged during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999. The graphite bombs (or blackout bombs) were used. The major substation for eastern Belgrade, in Le≈°tane was also bombed.  Features  = Cemeteries = New Be≈æanija Cemetery New Be≈æanija Cemetery (Novo Be≈æanijsko groblje), west of the settlement, is Belgrade's largest cemetery, covering an area of . It was open in 1974 and was conceived as the main cemetery for the Syrmian part of urban Belgrade (Zemun and New Belgrade). The project was designed in the Urbanism and Planning Institute Belgrade, and the main architect was Slobodanka Prekajski. Costruction of the Church of Thomas the Apostle began in 2001. It was finished and consecrated on 19 October 2003, on the Saint Thomas the Apostle day. Old Be≈æanija Cemetery Old cemetery, much smaller than the new one, is located in the old part of the settlement. Adjacent to it, in the locality Belanoviƒá Hole (Belanoviƒáa rupa), there is a memorial cemetery, dedicated to the World War II victims. Some 8,000 both civilian and military victims were buried here. Pet Cemetery In January 2019 it was announced that the forested area in Block 51, south of the Belgrade-Novi Sad highway, is chosen as the location of the first Belgrade's pet cemetery. The cemetery will cover an area of , 70% of which will be green areas. The entire complex will be bordered with the protective green belt, wide. The complex will consist of several areas: open area (800 burial places), forested cemetery (900), columbarium and rosarium (1,100), communal cemetery (1,400) and memorial park for the animals from the Belgrade Zoo. In the best case scenario, the construction will not start before 2020. In February 2020, city administration announced works for November 2020. The complex will also include administrative building, veterinary clinic and incinerator. = Dojno Polje Airport = Dojno Polje Airport in 1931 West of Be≈æanija and south of Zemun, between the village and the Sava river, is the location of the old Belgrade airport which was finished in March 1927. The locality was called Dojno Polje. Construction of an airfield began in 1923. An initiative asked for the creation of the airline company in 1926 which was approved by the government on 23 March 1926. Then the initial public offering began but largely failed as only 10% of the planned amount was gathered. According to the existing laws, the airline company was to be closed even before it was officially formed. In order to bust the sale of the shares, pilot Tadija Sondermajer decided to conduct the promotional flight Paris- Bombay-Belgrade. With his colleague , he started the journey on 20 April 1927 from Paris, arriving back to Belgrade after 11 days and , on 8 May. They were awaited as heroes by the crowd of 30,000. The sale of the shares was boosted and in three months there were sufficient funds for the company, named Aeroput and established on 17 June 1927, to purchase its first 4 airplanes. New administrative building was constructed in 1931 and to celebrate the occasion, a big air show of the biplanes was held. Around the airport, a workers settlement developed. The airport was destroyed by the Germans in 1944, and became defunct in 1962 when the new airport near the village of Surƒçin was finished (today's Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport). In 1960, of the former officer's club were adapted for the first permanent location of the future military aeronautical museum. First exhibition was held in 1961 and the permanent setup was organized in 1965. It was then decided that the museum would also host civilian aircraft. Civilian wing was established and by 1966 already held some 30 planes and the expansion became necessary. Air force then swapped the former airport complex for the apartments for its members throughout massively constructed New Belgrade. It was suggested that museum should remain, with added parcel of around it, but this was still not enough for all the hangars needed for the exhibitions. The idea was abandoned and the exhibition moved to Zemun in 1967 before it was decided that the Aeronautical Museum Belgrade will be built near Surƒçin. In April 2016 works began on the construction of the access road to the Ada Bridge. During works on the new boulevard, remnants of the old airport's runway, hangars and warehouses were discovered. The area is today occupied by the modern commercial and business neighborhood of Airport City Belgrade, named so after the old airport. = Cultural monuments = The Old Elementary School, at 68 Vojvoƒëanska Street, was built in 1891. It was a standard object of its kind, designed by the subdued postulates of the Academism. As the representative of the continual development of education in the 19th century, but also of the economic status and economy in general among the Serbian population of this area, it was declared a cultural monument in January 2019. It is also the oldest preserved building on the territory of the New Belgrade municipality. = Sport = Be≈æanija has many Sports facilities including tennis courts, basketball courts and the Stadion Be≈æanije, where FK Be≈æanija play their home matches. FK Be≈æanija was founded in 1921. Sub-neighborhoods Map of Local communities in Novi Beograd =Stara Be≈æanija= Stara Be≈æanija (Cyrillic: –°—Ç–∞—Ä–∞ –ë–µ–∂–∞–Ω–∏—ò–∞; Old Be≈æanija), as the name says, is the oldest section of Be≈æanija, location of the original village. It had a population of 13,378 in 2002 and 8,412 in 2011. At the roundabout on the corner of Surƒçinska and Vojvoƒëanska streets, an obelisk was erected in 2012 to celebrate the 500 years of the first mention of Be≈æanija. It is 5 meters, or 500 centimeters tall, one centimeter for each year. = Be≈æanijska Kosa = Orthodox Church of Saint Vasilije Ostro≈°ki in Be≈æanijska Kosa Northeastern extension of the Be≈æanija, along the loess ridge, is called Be≈æanijska Kosa (Cyrillic: –ë–µ–∂–∞–Ω–∏—ò—Å–∫–∞ –ö–æ—Å–∞; slope of Be≈æanija). It is crescent shaped, leaning on the western border of the urban area of Novi Beograd, stretching along the To≈°in bunar street to Zemun. Northern section of the neighborhood is crossed by the Belgrade-Zagreb highway. In 1883 Austrian general Laudon built a trench through the loess to make way for the railway, thus creating an artificial hill, known today as Be≈æanijska Kosa. Laudon's trench, whose remnants still can be seen but are turned into an informal settlement, marked to border between the south Kalvarija and north Be≈æanijska Kosa. Modern neighborhood was built in 1987. It roughly comprises Blocks 6, 35, 49, 50 and 60. Southern section is industrialized (IMT and Minel factories) and the location of the old airport (now a new neighborhood in the process of construction, Airport City Belgrade), while the central parts are mostly residential. Northern section, along the highway, comprises stadiums of the Be≈æanija and Radniƒçki soccer clubs, auto-camp, hotel Nacional, sports center of 11 April, Be≈æanija retirement home and one of the major Belgrade hospitals, KBC Be≈æanijska Kosa. In the northeast it borders the Studentski Grad while northwestern section belongs to the municipality of Zemun. The railway tunnel has been dug through the loess ridge. It distincts itself from the rest of Novi Beograd as it has no skyscrapers, but smaller, more 'humane' buildings. It had a population of 19,036 in 2002 and 29,792 in 2011. = Be≈æanijski Blokovi = Not considered part of the modern Be≈æanija, but rather as a separate neighborhood of Blokovi.

It receives highly processed sensory information from all sensory regions, and is generally accepted to be an important region for memory. It is bordered caudally by postrhinal cortex or parahippocampal cortex (homologous regions in rodents and primates, respectively) and ventrally and medially by entorhinal cortex.  Structure  The perirhinal cortex is composed of two regions: areas 36 and 35. Area 36 is sometimes divided into three subdivisions: 36d is the most rostral and dorsal, 36r ventral and caudal, and 36c the most caudal. Area 35 can be divided in the same manner, into 35d and 35v (for dorsal and ventral, respectively). Area 36 is six-layered, dysgranular, meaning that its layer IV is relatively sparse. Area 35 is agranular cortex (lacking any cells in layer IV).  Function  The perirhinal cortex is involved in both visual perception and memory; it facilitates the recognition and identification of environmental stimuli. Lesions to the perirhinal cortex in both monkeys and rats lead to the impairment of visual recognition memory, disrupting stimulus-stimulus associations and object-recognition abilities. The perirhinal cortex is also involved in item memory, especially in coding familiarity or recency of items. Rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones‚Äîthey were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but examined the novel and familiar objects equally, unlike undamaged rats. Thus, other brain regions are capable of noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source. The perirhinal cortex also receives a large dopaminergic input and signals the rewards that are associated with visual stimuli Liu Z., Richmond B.J. (2000) Response differences in monkey TE and perirhinal cortex: stimulus association related to reward schedules. J Neurophysiol. 2000 Mar;83(3):1677-92. https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2000.83.3.1677 Damage to the perirhinal cortex has been shown to cause impairment in discriminating among object concepts when there is a high degree of visual semantic overlap among choices, such as between a hairdryer and a gun.Douglas, D. M., Man, L. L. Y., Newsome, R. N., Park, H., Aslam, H. M., Barense, M., & Martin, C. B. (2019, July 31). Resolving visual and conceptual interference among object concepts requires medial temporal lobe cortex. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/d68jt A growing body of evidence suggests that the perirhinal cortex protects against interference from low-level visual features.Graham, K. S., Barense, M. D., & Lee, A. C. H. (2010). Going beyond LTM in the MTL: a synthesis of neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings on the role of the medial temporal lobe in memory and perception. Neuropsychologia, 48(4), 831‚Äì853. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.01.001 The perirhinal cortex's role in the formation and retrieval of stimulus- stimulus associations (and in virtue of its unique anatomical position in the medial temporal lobe) suggest that it is part of a larger semantic system that is crucial for endowing objects with meaning. Other animals = Primates = The monkey perirhinal cortex receives a majority of its input from high- level visual areas, whereas, in the rat, its inputs are primarily olfactory and, to a lesser extent, auditory. Outputs to orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex regions (such as prelimbic and infralimbic) have been described. Perirhinal cortex also sends output to a number of subcortical structures, including the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the basal forebrain, and the amygdala. It also has direct connections with hippocampus region CA1 and the subiculum. Perirhinal cortex projects to distal CA1 pyramidal cells, overlapping the projections from entorhinal cortex. The same CA1 cells send return projections back to perirhinal cortex. Inputs from subiculum terminate in both superficial and deep layers. Visual areas TE and TEO send and receive a significant reciprocal connection with perirhinal cortex. Weaker, but still significant, projections come from other parahippocampal regions and from the superior temporal sulcus. Other inputs include anterior cingulate and insular regions, in addition to prefrontal projections. = Rodents = Auditory inputs from temporal cortical regions are the primary inputs to rat 36d, with visual inputs becoming more prominent closer to the postrhinal cortical border. Area 36d projects to 36v and then to 35, which forms the primary output region of perirhinal cortex. Inputs to area 35 more strongly reflect olfactory and gustatory inputs from piriform and insular cortices, in addition to inputs from entorhinal cortex and frontal regions.

It features Little Toot, a small young tugboat in New York Harbor who does not want to tug. Instead, he would rather play, making figure eights in the harbor and thus being a nuisance to all the other tugboats. But when he ends up all alone on the open ocean as a storm is rolling in, it is up to him to save a grounded ocean liner. Publication history1939, USA, G. P. Putnam's Sons (93 unpaginated pages) *2007, USA, G. P. Putnam's Sons (86 unpaginated pages) The book (G. P. Putnam's Sons first children's book) has been continually in print since 1939. In 2007, in honor of what would have been Gramatky's 100th birthday, Penguin Putnam publishers rescanned the original artwork, added nine original full-color sketches by the illustrator, and brought back detailed endpapers so the book has been restored to its first-edition colors and vibrancy. Reception Kirkus Reviews gave Little Toot a starred review, it won the 1969 Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, and is a Library of Congress classic in children's literature. Daniel Pinkwater and Scott Simon read and raved about the 2007 restored classic edition (\\"Hardie Gramatky never speaks down to children\\") on NPR's Weekend Edition in October 2007. Legacy The story appeared in an animated segment of the Walt Disney Studios film Melody Time in 1948; the story was sung by the Andrews Sisters, with Vic Schoen providing the background musical score. In this version, Little Toot disgraces his father Big Toot by recklessly (albeit unintentionally) causing an ocean liner - one Big Toot was towing out to sea - to run aground and crash into skyscrapers in Manhattan. Little Toot is banished from the harbor as a result. In exile, Little Toot realizes that he must \\"grow up\\" - in other words, give up his careless ways - in order to earn respect from the other boats...including Big Toot, who has been stuck towing garbage scows ever since that fiasco with the ocean liner. Then Little Toot gets his chance: another ocean liner gets stuck on rocks, beyond the 12-mile limit; since Big Toot and the police boats are bottled up in the harbor by a storm, Little Toot must single-handedly rescue the grounded liner...which he does. This version was also adapted into comic strip form in two issues of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories in September and October 1948.http://www.michaelspornanimation.com/splog/?p=4324 When Capitol Records produced a record with the Disney Little Toot song, it was the first children's record to hit the 1,000,000 sales mark on Billboard, according to then-president Alan Livingston. An animated adaptation of Little Toot and the Loch Ness Monster was seen in Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories and was narrated by Rick Moranis. There was also another movie based on Little Toot called The New Adventures of Little Toot. It featured Samuel Vincent as the voice of the title character and was released on home video in 1992 by Strand Home Video.

A sequel, The Rumble Fish 2, has since been developed. Story The game takes place in the distant future during the 21st century. During the turn of the 21st century, a large-scale natural disaster tears through the eastern side of an unverified country, destroying its economical and political operations and taking a total of 158,000 lives. A prominent corporation in the series, called PROBE-NEXUS, moves its base of operations to the ruined east side and begins reconstructing the area. The rebuilt area flourishes again as it becomes a wealthy and busy city known as Zone Prime, which serves as the backdrop for many locales in the game. In the underground of Zone Prime, PROBE-NEXUS also sponsors a tournament known as the Fight for Survival, or F.F.S., where fighters are gathered from the city's slums and compete for sport. The first Rumble Fish game follows the fifth F.F.S. tournament. Gameplay The Rumble Fish uses a unique 2D fighting system with the ability to easily create combos. Weak attacks can easily chain into slower, stronger attacks, a common system shown in games like Guilty Gear and Melty Blood. There is also a button dedicated to multiple evasive maneuvers. The game also introduces the division of the power gauge into Offense and Defense. Advanced techniques are available to the player, at the cost of either gauge. =Offense= The Offense gauge fills as the player delivers attacks. As seen in its name, it is used to mount offensive attacks, such as super moves called Offensive Arts. Special techniques exclusive to this meter include the Jolt Attack, which is an unblockable attack that leaves the opponent vulnerable to potentially high-damaging combos, at the expense of a full Offense gauge. =Defense= The Defense gauge is filled as the player receives and guards against attacks from the opponent. Super moves called Defensive Arts are available only to this gauge; though they are not often as strong as an Offensive Art, they can be used in tactical situations (for example, while guarding an attack or while lying prone on the ground) to stop an opponent's offense. An advanced technique that uses the Defense gauge is the Impact Break, which breaks a player's guard after successfully blocking an attack to allow a counter-offensive. When both the Offense and Defense gauges are full, they merge into a Critical gauge. The benefits of both meters are still available, but each characters' strongest skill is only available at the Critical point. A new graphics engine was used to animate the various limbs of each character separately, allowing for more fluid animation. This engine also allows the clothes of each character to rip from wear and tear as they take more damage throughout a match. CharactersZen - A stoic man fighting for himself. He is an all-rounded character who is beginner-friendly. *Hikari - Kaya's sister, she is kind and gentle. She is an adept at defending and countering attacks. *Typhon - A young fighter who is quick and agile and has a range of projectile attacks. *Garnet - A playful woman who mainly attacks with her legs.

They were introduced by Gilles Robert in 1973, and were used by John Coates and Andrew Wiles in their work on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Elliptic units are an analogue for imaginary quadratic fields of cyclotomic units. They form an example of an Euler system. Definition A system of elliptic units may be constructed for an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication by the ring of integers R of an imaginary quadratic field F. For simplicity we assume that F has class number one. Let a be an ideal of R with generator Œ±. For a Weierstrass model of E, define :\\\\Theta_{\\\\mathbf{a}}(P) = \\\\alpha^{-12} \\\\Delta_E^{N\\\\mathbf{a} - 1} \\\\prod_{\\\\mathbf{a}P=0, P e0} (x-x(P))^{-6} \\\\ . where P is a point on E, Œî is the discriminant, and x is the X-coordinate on the Weierstrass model. The function Œò is independent of the choice of model, and is defined over the field of definition of E. Properties Let b be an ideal of R coprime to a and Q an R-generator of the b-torsion. Then Œòa(Q) is defined over the ray class field K(b), and if b is not a prime power then Œòa(Q) is a global unit: if b is a power of a prime p then Œòa(Q) is a unit away from p. The function Œòa satisfies a distribution relation for b = (Œ≤) coprime to a: : \\\\prod_{\\\\mathbf{b}Q=0} \\\\Theta_{\\\\mathbf{a}}(P+R) = \\\\Theta_{\\\\mathbf{a}}(\\\\beta P) \\\\ .

The family is subdivided as described below. Cystatins show similarity to fetuins, kininogens, histidine-rich glycoproteins and cystatin-related proteins. Cystatins mainly inhibit peptidase enzymes (another term for proteases) belonging to peptidase families C1 (papain family) and C13 (legumain family). They are known to mis-fold to form amyloid deposits and are implicated in several diseases. Types The cystatin family includes: * The Type 1 cystatins, which are intracellular and are present in the cytosol of many cell types, but can also appear in body fluids at significant concentrations. They are single-chain polypeptides of about 100 residues, which have neither disulfide bonds nor carbohydrate side- chains. Type 1 cystatins are also known as Stefins (after the Stefan Institute where they were first discovered ) * The Type 2 cystatins, which are mainly extracellular secreted polypeptides are largely acidic, contain four conserved cysteine residues known to form two disulfide bonds, may be glycosylated and/or phosphorylated. They are synthesised with a 19- to 28-residue signal peptide. They are broadly distributed and found in most body fluids. * The Type 3 cystatins, which are multidomain proteins. The mammalian representatives of this group are the kininogens. There are three different kininogens in mammals: H- (high-molecular-mass, ) and L- (low-molecular-mass) kininogen, which are found in a number of species, and T-kininogen, which is found only in rats. * Unclassified cystatins. These are cystatin-like proteins found in a range of organisms: plant phytocystatins, fetuin in mammals, insect cystatins, and a puff adder venom cystatin, which inhibits metalloproteases of the MEROPS peptidase family M12 (astacin/adamalysin). Also, a number of the cystatin-like proteins have been shown to be devoid of inhibitory activity. =Human cystatins= CST1, CST2, CST3 (cystatin C, a marker of kidney function), CST4, CST5, CST6, CST7, CST8, CST9, CST11, CSTA (cystatin A), CSTB (cystatin B) =Plant cystatins= Plant cystatins have special characteristics which permit them to be classified in a special class called Phytocystatin. One is the presence of a N-terminal alpha-helix, present only in plant cystatins. Phytocystatins are involved in several process, including plant germination and defense. van Wyk et al. found some 19 different cystatins similar to oryzacystatin-I in the soybean along with related cysteine proteases. Membrane permeability Chicken cystatin quickly passed the membrane of MCF-10A neo T cells and inhibited cathepsin B when it was acylated with fatty acyl residues of 6-18 carbon atoms.

Location  Eringate-Centennial-West Deane is a neighbourhood located in the north western corner of the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in close proximity to Pearson Airport and Highway 427. It is bounded on the west by Centennial Park and golf course, to the north by Eglinton Avenue West, on the east by Martin Grove Road, and on the south by Rathburn Road. The neighbourhood itself is fairly large, and encompasses several communities including West Deane Park and Centennial Park.  History  =West Deane Park= West Deane Park was farmland before the land was bought in the 1930s by construction magnate Percy Law. On this land, Law raised cattle and racehorses, built and maintained a storage depot for construction equipment and built a Colonial Revival style home. In the 1960s, the land was sold to prominent developer Edmund Peachey, whose company built much of the existing development. Peachey named the area West Deane Park after his wife Deane. Today the area is populated by people and families with varying income levels, ethnicities and household sizes. =Vallengrove Park= Vallengrove Park is a subdivision developed in 1961 between Wellesworth area and highway 27 by Vallen- Grove Developments. The three bedroom- one bath simple brick bungalows with garage on approx. fifty foot wide lots sold for approx. seventeen thousand dollars new. Their real estate value in 2011 sells from four hundred and seventy five thousand and up. It was marked in the early 1960s by a red brick entrance (West Deane still has its named entrance) at the then- connecting Birgitta Crescent- to the long-gone off entrance from the southbound service road of then Highway 27 (a farm house stood here right at the ramp), and leading into the suburb between that west of 27 towards Wellsworth Park, and halfway north along Odessa Ave. and as far as Renforth. That new area was built in 1961. The older area further north along Odessa and out branching roads was built a few years earlier: wherever one sees the old wood hydro poles instead of concrete. Vallengrove Park was once farmland. Cows bones were found by children digging around before all areas were paved and settled, and another farm was at the location of the Catholic church - Nativity of Our Lord and was torn down at same time. When Highway 27 was expanded into the 427, the east loop homes of Summerfield Crescent were expropriated around 1967, and moved to Bramalea (they are now located on Epsom Downs Drivehttp://bramaleablog.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/v68aug12a.png). Part of their front lawns can be seen today at the sound barrier wall. Wellsworth Junior School was opened in 1960 when hundreds of tulips were given by the Netherlands for planting. Tulips are still grown there almost 50 years later. The area's high school was Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute. It closed in 1986 with a reunion there. The northernmost part of The West Mall (an important and very busy artery today) ended as a bumpy, dirt bicycle path a short distance south of its intersection at Rathburn. The south end of that unfinished part continued to the edge of Burnhamthorpe, where Percy Bishop built the new Etobicore Mall across from the Shaver/Bishop farm house - then directly at the corner of Burnhamthorpe and The West Mall. Mr. Bishop gave land to Etobicoke in order for the road to be opened up, and had it built, around 1964. Schools Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute is a defunct public secondary school located in this neighborhood from 1961 to 1985, Since 1993, Michael Power/St. Joseph High School a public secondary separate school, operated by the Toronto Catholic District School Board, is housed there. * Briarcrest Junior School - A public elementary school located at 60 Wellesworth Drive, east of Renforth Drive. It was opened in September 1958. * Hollycrest Middle School - A middle school located close to the intersection of Renforth Drive and Rathburn Road. It is on the western boundary of the Toronto District School Board. It was built in 1967 as a special Centennial project. The school hosts a High Performers program. It has wide, open spaces, bordering the Etobicoke Olympium. Students from elementary schools such as Wellesworth Junior School, Briarcrest Junior School, Mill Valley Junior School and Broadacres Junior School are most likely to be in Hollycrest. There are also students from all over Etobicoke. Hollycrest is a feeder school for Silverthorn Collegiate Institute and was formerly a feeder for the now-closed nearby Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute. * Josyf Cardinal Slipyj Elementary Byzantine Rite Catholic School (housed in the former West Deane Junior School) * Michael Power/St. Joseph High School (housed in the former Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute building, founded 1961 until 1985) * Mother Cabrini Catholic Elementary School *Nativity of Our Lord Elementary School - A Catholic elementary school located at 35 Saffron Crescent, close to the intersection of Renforth Drive and Rathburn Road. It is situated next door to the church of the same name. The school has 2 floors and 9 outdoor portable classrooms. The school has an optional French immersion program that begins in Grade 5. It is a feeder school for Etobicoke's first Catholic secondary school, Michael Power/St. Joseph High School, which moved to a nearby location in the 1990s. *Seneca School is a public elementary school located on Rathburn Road close to the intersection of Renforth Drive, beside the Etobicoke Olympium and in Centennial Park. The school was originally built by the Metropolitan Toronto Association for the mentally challenged in 1967. At that time, it served students from ages seven to twenty-one years of age. Currently, the school provides a structured team approach to support primary and junior students, aged 4 to 12, who have developmental challenges. *Wellesworth Junior School is a public elementary school located at 225 Wellesworth Drive, north of Rathburn Road, east of Renforth Drive and west of Highway 427.

Appeal to the Great Spirit was cast in Paris, and won a gold medal for its exhibition in the Paris Salon. On January 23, 1912, it was installed outside the main entrance to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.. See also \\"Big Bronze Statue by Cyrus Dallin Placed at Museum\\", The Christian Science Monitor, January 24, 1912, p. 1. A restoration of the Boston version was reversed at Dallin's request because he preferred the light green tones that had developed on the equestrian sculpture over time rather than the typical \\"statuary brown\\" patina the conservator applied without consulting him.

Dallin.jpgProtest of the Sioux (1904) Smaller versions An edition of nine 40-inch bronzes of Appeal to the Great Spirit was produced about 1922. One is the centerpiece of the Tower Room of Dartmouth College's Baker Tower, the college's main library and most iconic building.Dartmouth was founded as an institution to educate the Native Americans of New England, and it recalls that heritage through art such as Dallin's Appeal to the Great Spirit. There is a full-scale model in Muncie, Indiana, in the intersection of Walnut and Granville streets in the Wysor Heights Historic District, and is considered by many residents to be a symbol of Muncie. A plaster example in this size is at the Cyrus Dallin Museum in Arlington, Massachusetts, and another is in the Rockwell Museum in Corning, New York. Central High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, possesses another plaster example, which was used, in 1985, as the model for a bronze version. The casting was done by American Artbronze Fine Arts Foundry under the direction of Howard R. Kirsch. The heroic-sized bronze is now installed in Woodward Park in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the intersection of 21st Street and Peoria. Examples of the 21-inch bronze statuette are at the White House, the U.S. Department of State, and many American museums. An 8-1/2-inch miniature edition was produced by the Gorham Manufacturing Company in 1913; in 2009, No. 263 sold for $9,375.

W. Cooper. * The sculpture is used as the logo for the Beach Boys' vanity record label Brother Records. It was first seen in the lower-left corner on the band's 1967 album Smiley Smile and its attending single \\"Heroes and Villains\\", and was used more prominently on the cover of their 1973 album The Beach Boys in Concert. When Beach Boy Carl Wilson was asked in 1975 why the group used this as their logo, he said the Indian was chosen because Brian, Dennis, and Carl's grandfather believed that there was a spiritual Indian \\"guide\\" who watched over them from the \\"other side.\\" The choice of the logo was Brian's. Carl called the logo \\"The Last Horizon.\\" * A painting of the sculpture appears on the cover of the album The Time Is Near (1970) by the rock group Keef Hartley Band. * A painting of the sculpture appears on the cover of the album Spirit of God (1984) by the Native American Gospel recording artist Johnny P. Curtis. * A painting of the sculpture appears on the cover of the album Lysol (1992) by rock group The Melvins. * In the vinyl release of Directions to See a Ghost (2008) by the American rock band The Black Angels, the poster inside features a skeleton form of this sculpture with a psychedelic background.

When cells are lysed for these studies, proteases, many of which are contained within lysosomes, are released. These proteases, if freely present in the lysate, would destroy any products from the reaction being studied, and make the experiment uninterpretable. For example, leupeptin could be used in a calpain extraction to keep calpain from being hydrolyzed by specific proteases. The suggested concentration is 1-10 ŒºM (0.5-5 Œºg/ml). Leupeptin is an organic compound produced by actinomycetes, which inhibits serine, cysteine and threonine proteases. Leupeptin inhibits serine proteinases (trypsin (Ki=3.5 nM), plasmin (Ki= 3.4 nM), porcine kallikrein), and cysteine proteinases (papain, cathepsin B (Ki = 4.1 nM), endoproteinase Lys-C).

It came into existence in 1961, replacing the ethnically based Fiji Indian Football Association. The Indian Association was formed in 1938 but football in Fiji had a much humbler beginning.  History of Fijian football  Football started to be played in Fiji ever since the arrival of Europeans in Fiji and establishment of towns like Levuka where significant numbers of sports enthusiasts could congregate and socialise with a friendly game. Missionaries, who established schools in Fiji, introduced football as part of the school program and football was being played in schools as early as 1889. The Suva Soccer Football Club was formed in 1905, made up of European employees of the Government and businesses and similar clubs existed in Nausori and Levuka. In 1910, a team representing Suva played a match against a team representing Nausori. Crew of visiting naval ships also entertained themselves with friendly games of football with local teams. In 1910 a team from Suva played a game against a team from HMS Powerful and won 3 goals to 1. In 1914, a team from Suva played against a team from HMS Torch, at Albert Park, and won by 2 goals to nil.  Native Fijian football  Fijian teams started playing competitive football in 1924. The first Fijian Inter-District Tournament was played at Nasau Park, Levuka, during celebrations marking the golden jubilee of Cession in 1924. Teams played for the Ricarnie Cup which was won by the Sawani team from Naitasiri. The following year, Bau won the cup. Players played the game barefoot and relied on speed and stamina. Other teams to compete in the tournament were Shamrock from Suva, Kadavu (from Suva), Lomaiviti (from Suva) and Ovalau (from Levuka). Meanwhile, football was also being played by Fijians in Lautoka. A Friday and Saturday league was organised at the Veitari Grounds and teams that took part were Namoli, Vitogo, Vakabuli, Saru, Yalobi (from Waya), Kadavu, Vanua Levu and Topline. The Namoli Native Soccer Club won the league nine times in a row between 1941 and 1949. A prominent member of the club was Ratu Meli Qoro, who also acted as an official and referee at tournaments. He had learnt to play football at the local Methodist Mission Primary school. In the northern division, football was played between the Wainikoro and Waibula District Fijian Schools in 1938. The success of Fijians at rugby, tempered their enthusiasm for football and the physical nature of rugby appealed to them and gradually organised football amongst the Fijians died out.  Fiji Indians take up football  Schools run by missionaries, also taught students to play football. Brother Mark, a Marist missionary from New Zealand introduced football to Marist Brothers Indian School in Toorak, Suva and organised games with students from other schools. As the students grew up and left school, they started playing football socially on their own. When the Colonial Sugar Refining Company(CSR) set up sugar mills in Fiji it also set aside land for recreational activities. Some mill managers actively encouraged workers and farmers to play the game. The Nausori mill manager provided a full sized playing field in 1925 and in the 1930s erected temporary enclosure to enable the collection of entrance fees during tournaments. In Ba, the mill manager provided a trophy, in the 1930s, for the local league competition. In 1930, the Governor made available two playing fields in Suva for use in football competitions. In 1922, the Sunshine Club was established in Suva and the Sitare Hind (Stars of India) club established in Rewa. These two teams played each other on a regular basis. Gradually other teams, like Morning Star, Nausori Central, Vuci and Wainibokasi, were established in Rewa and played at the Dilkusha Grounds. There were also four teams in Suva who played at the Marist Brothers School grounds in Toorak.  The first football association  The Indian Reform League was the first to form an association to organise football in Fiji. The league was made up educated Fiji Indians and many of its members had links to the Christian churches in Fiji. In addition to football, it also organised cricket, hockey and lawn-tennis. In December 1927, the league organised a schools football competition at Albert Park. Schools that took part in it were Methodist Mission School, Marist Brothers School, Munivatu Indian School and Islamia School. Buoyed by the success of this tournament, the league met on 22 January 1928 and formed a Football Association committee. The editor of the monthly Hindi/English magazine, Vriddhi, Dr I.H. Beattie donated a trophy and the first competition was organised on 26 May 1928 at the Marist Brothers School ground. The teams that took part were Indian Reform League Football Club, Toorak Service Club, Dilkusha Excelsior Football Club, Rewa Football Club and the Union Club. Dilkusha Excelsior won the competition for the first three years. In 1936, the association was renamed, the Suva Football Association. The number of teams grew to 8 in 1936, 16 in 1945 and 41 in 1958 with competition being organised in senior, reserve, intermediate and junior grades.  Football associations around Fiji  Rewa started its own league in 1928 and the Rewa United Football Club was formed to take part in the Vriddhi Cup Tournament. The other team from Rewa was the Dilkusha Excelsior. In 1937 the Rewa Indian Football Association was formed. In Ba, efforts by Pundit Ami Chandra, with support from CSR led to the formation of the Ba Indian Football Association in 1935. The local league had four teams in 1940. In Lautoka, John Bairangi led the formation of the Lautoka Soccer Football Association in 1934. Initially there were two teams, Namoli Indian Sports and Service. Levuka had an organised local competition in 1932 and these clubs formed the Levuka Indian Soccer Association in 1938. The Nadi Indian Soccer Association was formed in 1937 with four teams: Koronubu, Sabeto, Bhartiya and Vutualevu. From 1940 the football playing districts of the western division, played for the Caine‚Äôs Cup.  Fiji Indian Football Association  The formation of Fiji Indian Football Association was proposed by Arthur Stanley Farebrother, a Suva businessman. As the teams from Suva, Rewa, Ba, Levuka and Lautoka gathered in Suva for an inter-district tournament, a meeting was organised on 8 October 1938 in the office of A.S. Farebrother and Company and the Fiji Indian Football Association was formed to organise and control football in Fiji. A.S. Farebrother was its first President. The first inter-district football tournament was held in Suva on 9 and 10 October 1938 for the Lloyd - Farebother trophy donated by Lloyd and Company and A.S. Farebrother and Company. Rewa won the first competition by defeating Ba by 3 goals to 2. The constitution of the Association was adopted at a meeting in Lautoka on 22 April 1939. The following year Nadi, Nadroga and Rakiraki also joined the Association. During the war years there was no dampening of interest in football in Fiji, which saw the domination of the inter-district competition by three teams: Rewa (which won in 1938, 1939, 1943 & 1944), Suva (which won in 1940 & 1945) and Lautoka (which won in 1941 & 42). In 1943 Navua and Tailevu/Naitasiri also joined the Association and Taveuni joined in 1947. In 1958, when the association celebrated its 21st inter-district tournament, 14 districts took part. It is important to note that in 1963, a rival Association was being formed and the then Secretary Mr. D.S. Naidu, from Lautoka in consultation With M Vasagam Pillay the President, decided to register with FIFA. The difficulty was that Fiji FA during this time also had the acronym FIFA (Fiji Indian Football Association). FIFA did not mind so much the acronym but objected to the racial connotation Indian. D S Naidu sent a cablegram in reply agreeing to change the name to Fiji Football Association. Thus the name change occurred and FIFA became FFA and attained the membership of Federation de International de Football Association. This change in status gave FFA the sole right of controlling organised soccer Football in Fiji.  Competitions organised  From 1942, Suva and Rewa played yearly for the King Irving Cup. From 1949 all teams in the southern district played for the McIlwain Cup. In the west, the regional competition continued for the new Lautoka General Transport Trophy, until 1977. The Fiji Secondary Schools Soccer Association was formed in 1950 and from 1951 regular secondary school competitions have been organised. These tournaments were dominated by Natabua High School of Lautoka, Xavier College of Ba, Shri Vivekananda High School of Nadi and DAV Boys, Indian High and Marist of Suva. In 1975, the Fiji Primary Schools Soccer Association was formed to organise competitions for primary school students. Lautoka dominated Fiji football in the late fifties by winning three inter- district tournaments in a row (1957‚Äì1959) and four North-West Tournaments in a row (1957‚Äì1960). It also had numerous wins against Suva for the annual Pala Cup and against Ba for the Sugar Cup.  Formation of multi-racial association  After many years of discussion, and stiff opposition from some quarters, it was decided in August 1961 to remove the word ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù from the title of the Fiji Indian Football Association, thus forming the Fiji Football Association ‚Äì a truly multiracial and national body. With this new status Fiji‚Äôs football team participated in first South Pacific Games held in Suva in 1963. The opening up of football to all races saw teams like Ba immediately benefiting from the new arrangement. Football in Ba had long enjoyed support from the Fijian community and Ba soon had some good and famous Fijians playing in its team. Suva‚Äôs multiracial population also provided early opportunity for people of other races to join the football competitions.  Football in Fiji in the sixties  Football in Fiji was dominated by the Ba team in the sixties. In the sixties Ba won the inter-district football tournament five times, the last three in a row from 1966 to 1968. Ba also won the North-west football tournament and the Sugar Cup. In 1968, the Fiji Football Association adopted a two tier system where Ba, Labasa, Lautoka, Nadi, Rakiraki, Rewa, Sigatoka and Suva were placed in division A and Levuka, Tailevu-Naitasiri, Tailevu North, Savusavu, Taveuni and Navua were placed in division B. Division B competed for the Fiji Football Association Cup, won for the first time by Levuka. At the end of the season there were promotion-relegation matches. In 1969 the inter- district football tournament was held in Labasa for the first time and Nadi won the trophy for the first time.  Football in Fiji in the seventies  In the 1970s, the association was able to convince town councils to build permanent seating structures and grounds for football and by the late nineties all A division teams, except two had such facilities. From 1976 pool play was introduced into the inter-district football tournament. Regular district level competitions were organised with the formation of the National League in 1977. The Battle of Giants tournament started in 1978. A Girmit Tournament was organised in 1979 to celebrate the centenary of the arrival of the Indians.  Football in Fiji in the eighties  In 1980, the Fiji Football Association acquired its own building, which is being used as an administration centre. For the first time since 1938, the inter-district football tournament was not held in 1987. This was due to uncertainties following the coup and restrictions on playing football on Sundays. 1988 was the golden jubilee year for the association as football in Fiji learnt to perform under the new post- coup conditions.  The nineties and beyond  Football is now well established in Fiji with people of all races taking part. Facilities for players have been greatly improved and the Fiji national side regularly takes part in international tournaments.

During the war, he sang in Munich and at the opera of The Hague (then occupied by German troops). He sang at the Salzburg Festival from 1949 on (singing the role of Kreon in the premiere of Carl Orff's Antigonae), at the Bayreuth Festival from 1951 on and at the Metropolitan Opera from 1955 to 1964. He began as a low, dark bass, and later moved up to baritone. He continued singing low bass roles occasionally, such as the Grand Inquisitor from Don Carlos. The cutting quality of his voice and diction lead to him being cast in villainous roles at the Bayreuth Festival, such as Telramund and Klingsor, or in morally ambiguous roles such as Wotan, Gunther or the title role in Flying Dutchman. In spite of being a famous singer, he often also sang small roles such as Donner in Das Rheingold, Melot in Tristan und Isolde, the Grand Inquisitor in Don Carlos, and Shchelkalov in Boris Godunov. In the United States, he created a sensation at the Metropolitan Opera in his debut title role as Wozzeck (sung in English), with Eleanor Steber singing Marie.

It depicts the relationship between a fashion model and an eccentric tattoo artist that quickly turns sinister. Plot Tattoo artist Karl Kinsky (Dern) is approached to work with renowned photographer Halsey (Leonard Frey) on temporary tattoos for swimsuit models. Despite his misgivings, Kinsky agrees to participate after seeing photographs of one of the models, Maddy (Adams). Maddy arrives late to the photoshoot, but the two quickly bond when she expresses admiration for Kinsky's arm tattoos and recognizes their Japanese influence. After the shoot, Kinsky jealously eavesdrops on Maddy and her flirtatious boyfriend, jazz musician Buddy (John Getz). Maddy complains of having had to \\"dope\\" herself to sleep because of Buddy's odd hours. Maddy invites Kinsky to dinner, where he awkwardly asserts his dominance towards the ma√Ætre d‚Ä≤, and then threatens to kill Maddy's ex- boyfriend Albert (Sam Schacht) for using profanity and drunkenly flirting with Maddy. They quickly leave the restaurant and drive to Maddy's apartment. She invites him in, but he declines, saying he has to catch the last train home. Instead, he goes to a sex show and aggressively speaks to a peep show girl. The next day, Kinsky surprises Maddy in Central Park with flowers. After confronting her over her use of sleeping pills, he invites her to dine with him at his apartment. She admires his tattoo equipment and artwork. Kinsky explains his theory that women who get tattoos, which he calls \\"the mark\\", do so out of a desire to belong. The two go upstairs to dine, and listen to Buddy's music. Kinsky tells Maddy she deserves better than Buddy, citing his handsiness. Maddy calls him \\"old-fashioned\\", but begins to makes a pass at him. Kinsky turns her down, citing a need for commitment. Maddy tells him, \\"People don't make commitments when they fuck anymore\\" and Kinsky snaps at her over her use of profanity. He kicks her out but follows her to the street, insisting that they see each other again. She agrees to meet him at a Japanese art exhibition at the Met before speeding off in a taxi. The same night, Kinsky repeatedly telephones and berates Maddy from a telephone booth. When she asks him to stop, he returns to his apartment and intently watches her modeling tape. On the day of the exhibition, Maddy sends her friend Sandra (Rikke Borge) to tell Kinsky that Maddy is out of town, and to ask him to return her modeling tapes. He visits Maddy's apartment, where he is told the same thing by Buddy. He leaves an ominous message on her answering machine, before returning to his family's home to show it to prospective buyers, only to announce that it is not for sale. Back in Maddy's apartment, she kicks Buddy and his jazz band out for keeping her awake. As she is cleaning up, the doorbell rings. When she answers the door, Kinsky incapacitates her with a chloroform-soaked rag. The next morning she awakens and discovers her chest, shoulders and back have been tattooed with floral patterns. She screams at Kinsky and smashes a mirror once she realizes she has become a hostage. Once Kinsky tells her he is not finished tattooing her, she faints. The next day, the tattoos have been partially colored in. Maddy makes a failed escape attempt, after which Kinsky has her call Buddy at knifepoint to tell him she will not be coming home. Recognizing Kinsky's increasing violence, Maddy agrees to \\"wear the mark\\" in exchange for her safety. Nearly finished with the tattoo, Kinsky stops and has Maddy masturbate while he watches from another room, much like the peep show he visited earlier. Kinsky orgasms just as she begins weeping. Maddy berates him for not \\"being a man\\" and having sexual intercourse with her instead. She finds a shard of glass from the mirror and plans to kill Kinsky with it, but is discovered. She seemingly resigns herself to her fate as Kinsky continues to expand the tattoos over her entire body. Maddy is shocked when Kinsky finally announces, \\"It's all finished.\\" He disrobes them both and begins to rape her. Maddy is able to grasp the tattoo gun and plunges it into Kinsky's back. As Kinsky dies, Maddy sits up, his limp body draped across her lap. She strokes his hair as she stares off into the distance.

It was featured in an April 13, 1980 New York Times article spotlighting films being shot on-location in New York City; the article mistakenly identified Rikke Borge as Dern's love interest. The tattoo designs seen in the film are credited to Isadore Selzter, a prolific illustrator and graphic designer known for drawing many Sesame Street Magazine covers. The film had a contentious post-production and pre-release phase. Producer Joseph E. Levine made edits without informing director Bob Brooks, who wrote an angry letter to Levine accusing him of prioritizing the opinions of \\"assholes in Los Angeles.\\" Feminist group Women Against Pornography protested the film for allegedly equating violence with love. They defaced the advertisements in the subway, which reportedly delighted Levine, who considered it free publicity. Tellingly, although the release date was announced as November or December 1980 in the NYT article, the film was delayed nearly a year until October 9, 1981. In 2020, a Blu-ray release was planned by Scream Factory, but after going through two release dates, it was scrapped as they could not find any suitable elements for a new master of the movie.  Soundtrack  The songs \\"What's Your Name\\" and \\"Shot in the Dark\\" were written by Barry DeVorzon and Michael Towers, and sung by Euca Burrows. Other instrumental music is heard in the film, but an official soundtrack was not released.  Critical reception  Tattoo earned a Worst Actor Razzie nomination for Dern, who lost to Klinton Spilsbury for his performance in The Legend of the Lone Ranger. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film two out of four stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the film's first two acts, and singled out Dern's performance as \\"very good,\\" but thought the film faltered in the triteness of its climax. He wrote,\\"Tattoo could have been an effective and disturbing movie...[It] opens so promisingly that its crucial scenes are doubly disappointing. Because the film's first hour makes it clear that Tattoo is not intended as just another creepy horror film, the failure of the conclusion is all the more disappointing.\\" New York Times film critic Janet Maslin gave the film a similar review. She praised the two leads, along with Borge and Frey, but wrote that while the film \\"begins with a bit of style...[it] doesn't take long...to turn predictable and slow.\\" The film's depiction of stalking has been compared to the much more successful films Taxi Driver and Maniac.  Cultural reception  In Episode 4 of Series 2 of the BBC sitcom The Royle Family, the film is discussed extensively. The character Denise calls it \\"absolutely brilliant,\\" and explains the plot to Barbara and Cheryl, who are both fascinated and horrified.

It occurred during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, which brought many white settlers to the Fraser Canyon area. Largely ignored by Canadian historians,Claiming the Land, Dan Marshall, UBC Ph.D Thesis, 2002 (unpubl.)McGowan's War, Donald J. Hauka, New Star Books, Vancouver (2000) it was one of the seminal events of the founding of the colony. Although it ended relatively peaceably, it was a major test of the new administration's control over the goldfields, which were distant and difficult to access from the centre of colonial authority at Victoria in the Colony of Vancouver Island (New Westminster had recently been surveyed as the de jure capital, but the de facto capital was in Victoria, where the Governor was located). Combatants British troops were not involved, and only arrived on scene once the war was over. The combatants of the war were six hastily assembled regiments of irregulars mustered from the goldfields around Yale, British Columbia and the Nlaka'pamux people of the Fraser Canyon upstream from there. The militias, or \\"companies\\", were formed mostly of Americans but including German and French mercenaries who had served in Nicaragua, as had some of the Americans. The Nlaka'pamux, usually known in English as the Thompson or Hakamaugh (an attempt at pronouncing \\"Nlaka'pamux\\"), also were known as the Couteau or \\"Knife\\" Indians, partly as a result of this war (their region, the middle Fraser Canyon and Thompson Canyon, also appears on period maps as \\"the Couteau Country\\", which may also be a reference to the serrated benchlands lining the rivers' canyons). The name \\"Kootomin\\" also appears on very early maps showing routes to the goldfields. Enlisted to the Nlaka'pamux side, but not seeing combat, were allied warriors from the Secwepemc, Nicola, Okanagan and other tribes. The Nlaka'pamux of the lower Canyon, notably the Spuzzum people, as well as the St'at'imc and Sto:lo peoples, remained \\"friendly Indians\\". Canyon war The war was precipitated when a young Nlaka'pamux woman was raped by a group of American miners, in the area of Kanaka Bar. The Nlaka'pamux retaliated by killing several of them, decapitating the bodies and dumping them into the river; they eventually were to be found circling in a large eddy near the town of Yale, the main commercial centre of the rush. This alarmed the thousands of miners lining the riverbanks between there and Kanaka Bar. For some time in the months leading up to this incident, tensions had rose due to increasing conflict between indigenous people and the encroaching miners. Conflict broke out amongst the parties when a group of goldseekers sparred with a party of Indians that had previously killed several white men and dumped them into a pool in much the same manner as the incident at Yale. Due to the reputation of the Nlaka'pamux, the riverbanks north of Yale were emptied, as miners in the thousands fled south to the relative safety of Spuzzum and Yale. Meetings were held by the miners, most of whom had been in the California gold rush but were a diverse lot of men from all over the world. Of the six regiments hastily organized to respond to the war, one named the Austrian Company, captained by a John Centras, was composed of French and German irregulars who had served with the William Walker filibustering campaign in Nicaragua in 1853, and had relocated to the California goldfields afterwards, following the other Californian miners northwards to Yale when news of the Fraser rush reached San Francisco (many of the Americans in the goldfields had also served in Walker's rebellion). Another regiment, the Whatcom Company, was formed of mostly southerners under the command of Captain Graham. This regiment was of the \\"a good Indian is a dead Indian\\" persuasion and was bent on a war of extermination. The Whatcom Company's name was taken from that of the Whatcom Trail, which traversed what is now Whatcom County, Washington state from Bellingham Bay on Puget Sound, and which was used in open defiance of the British colonial administration's edict that access to the goldfields be made from Victoria and via steamboat from there only; in other words, their name implicitly indicated their annexationist sentiments. The largest and most influential company formed in the chaotic situation was the New York Pike Guards, led by a Captain Snyder , who swayed the assembled miners' committees for a war of pacification, rather than a war of extermination as was the wish of Captain Graham and others. . Snyder proposed that a distinction be made between warlike and friendly Indians, and messengers should be sent up the Canyon ahead of the advancing companies for friendly natives to display a white flag as a sign of peace.. The war parties left Yale and progressed to Spuzzum, where the companies found 3000 panicked miners encamped in a small area near the native rancherie, worried for their safety but unable to proceed any further south. Snyder's and Centras' companies crossed to the east side of the river at this point, which was one of the only viable crossings, with Snyder sending Graham's group up the west side of the river. The New York and Austrian Companies met no resistance on the journey north, and sent messages forward to Camchin, the ancient Nlaka'pamux \\"capital\\" at the confluence of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers (today's town of Lytton), that they were coming to parley peace, not make war. Meanwhile, Graham and his men rampaged up the west bank of the Canyon, destroying native food caches and potato fields but otherwise encountering only a few natives, most of whom had withdrawn into the deep mountain valleys flanking the canyon as refuge. The Whatcom Company were wiped out in a night- time gun-battle, witnessed by the other companies encamped across the river at the time . This was not due to native attack, but rather to a panicked reaction to a rifle falling over and misfiring, causing a melee from which only two or three men survived, as all the rest died shooting at each other in the dark. At Camchin, the assembled leaders of the Nlaka'pamux and allies from the Secwepemc (Shuswap) and Okanagan peoples held council. The Nlaka'pamux war leader tried to incite the assembled warriors to wipe out the white men once and for all, but the Camchin chief Cxpentlum (known commonly in English as Spintlum, or David Spintlum), had good relations with Governor James Douglas and argued for peaceful co-existence. Snyder and Centras marched into the midst of the Nlaka'pamux war council undaunted; if they had known about the thousands of warriors watching from the surrounding mountainsides they might not have been so bold. As per native custom, they were given the right to speak, presumably speaking through translators, and told the assembled natives that if the war were to continue, white men by the thousands would come and occupy the country and destroy all the natives forever. In their own notes they presumed it was because they showed the natives their more-modern rifles (most natives, if they had firearms, had only muskets and carbines) and thought that this had persuaded them to make peace. In reality, the decision to make peace had already just been arrived at, as the native account has shown, but it is probable that the notion that it would be impossible to wipe out all white men helped persuade any chiefs sitting on the fence to take the side of the peace-maker Cxpentlum. Six treaties were made that day, known as the Snyder Treaties, none of which has survived either in print or oral form, dealing with the co-existence in the Canyon and the working of the goldfields lining it. (Natives were the first to mine gold on the Thompson, and remained active miners throughout the rush.) Aftermath No formal figures of the dead from the Fraser Canyon War exist, and much hyperbole has been made by both sides. Estimates of the white dead range from several dozen to several hundred or even thousands; some say the native casualties were extreme. Just after the war parties' return to Yale, Governor Douglas and a contingent of Royal Engineers arrived to take control of what was feared to have been a situation that could easily have led to a war not only of extermination, but also of annexation. Douglas had already been mortified that miners' committees had been established and the \\"California system\\" of claims had been implemented, without his say-so and outside the bounds of British law. He was even more mortified to discover that Snyder and Centras, without a mandate, had proceeded to make treaties with the natives, which was under British law entirely the jurisdiction of the Crown. He admonished the Americans, but they were conciliatory and swore to abide by the Queen's laws henceforth. It was during this visit that the stage was set for the impending McGowan's War fiasco, as it was during this visit that the justices for Yale and Hill's Bar (Whannell and Perrier, respectively) were appointed by Douglas, who had no idea of their real characters and the consequences these appointments would all too quickly bring to local politics. Also accompanying the Governor on his steamboat journey to Yale on this occasion was one Ned McGowan, known as \\"the notorious\\" or as \\"the ubiquitous\\", whose presence would precipitate the subsequent series of improbable events known as McGowan's War later in the winter.

P. Abraham & Sons, Keswick and the Dolomites in Italy.\\"Bergakrobaten: Die Dolomiten und die Erfindung des Kletterns\\", Citt√† di Bolzano, Bolzano 2006 Rock climbing evolved gradually from an alpine necessity to an athletic sport in its own right, making it imprudent to cite a primogenitor of the latter in each of these three locales. Nevertheless, there is some general agreement on the following: *Heralded as a sport in England in the late 1880s after the (well publicised) solo first ascent of the Napes Needle by Walter Parry Haskett Smith, rock climbing attracted increasing numbers of participants. An early benchmark approaching modern levels of difficulty was the ascent, by O. G. Jones, of Kern Knotts Crack (VS) in 1897. Jones was attracted to the new sport by a photo of the Needle in a shop window in the early 1890s. By the end of the Victorian era as many as 60 enthusiasts at a time would gather at the Wastwater Hotel in the Lake District during vacation periods.Hankinson, Alan (1972). \\"The First Tigers\\", J. M. Dent & Sons, London *Inspired by the efforts of late 19th century pioneers such as Oskar Schuster (Falkenstein, Schusterweg 1892), by 1903 there were approximately 500 climbers active in the Elbe Sandstone region, including the well-known team of Rudolf Fehrmann and the American Oliver Perry-Smith; their 1906 ascent of Teufelsturm (at VIIb) set new standards of difficulty. By the 1930s there were over 200 small climbing clubs represented in the area. *The solo first ascent of Die Vajolett√ºrme in 1887 by the 17-year-old Munich high school student, Georg Winkler, encouraged the acceptance and development of the sport in the Dolomites. As rock climbing matured, a variety of grading systems were created in order to more accurately compare relative difficulties of climbs. Over the years both climbing techniques and the equipment climbers use to advance the sport have evolved in a steady fashion...  Some historical benchmarks 1492 : Antoine de Ville ascends Mont Inaccessible, Mont Aiguille, a 300-meter rock tower south of Grenoble, France. Under orders from his king, he used the techniques developed for sieging castles to attain an otherwise unreachable summit. The ascent is described by Fran√ßois Rabelais in his Quart Livre. *1695 : Martin Martin describes the traditional practice of fowling by climbing with the use of ropes in the Hebrides of Scotland, especially on St Kilda.Martin, Martin (1703) \\"A Voyage to St. Kilda\\" in A Description of The Western Islands of Scotland .

It took another century before history documents the use of devices similar to today‚Äôs fixed anchors: pitons, bolts and rappel slings. =19th century= Napes Needle, first climbed by W P Haskett Smith in 1886 *By the 19th century, climbing was developing as a recreational pastime. Equipment in the early 19th century began with an alpenstock (a large walking stick with a metal tip), a primitive form of three-point instep crampon, and a woodcutter's axe. These were the tools of the alpine shepherd, who was shortly to move from guiding sheep to guiding men, a much more lucrative enterprise. With time the alpenstock and the axe were combined into one tool: the ice-axe. Add a large, thick (and weak) rope, to help the client climb, and guide and novice were off to the mountains. *1848 : Sebastian Abratzky, a local chimney sweep, enters K√∂nigstein Fortress by climbing one of the chimneys in the sandstone faces of the plateau to avoid paying an entrance fee. This is now considered historically the first free climb in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and still a climbing route known as Abratzkykamin (IV (ca 5.4)). *1864 : Gustav Tr√∂ger, Ernst Fischer, J. W√§hnert und H. Frenzel, members of the local gymnastics association in Bad Schandau, climb the Falkenstein with artificial aid like ladders after several failed attempts. This is nowadays considered the start of rock climbing as a sport in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The Turnerweg (III (ca 5.3)) remains the easiest route to the top. *1869 : John Muir, famed naturalist and climber, wearing hiking boots, makes the first ascent of Cathedral Peak in Tuolumne Meadows as an on-sight, free solo. *1874 : Otto Ewald Ufer and H. Frick make the first ascent of M√∂nch. This is the first free ascent of a climbing rock in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains without artificial aid for sport. *1875 : Half Dome in Yosemite National Park was climbed by George Anderson. He used eye bolts in drilled holes as hand and toe holds.

The First Great climb, BBC News This could also be considered the start of the Sport of Rock Climbing. *1880s : The Sport of Rock Climbing begins in the Lake District, Peak District and Wales in Great Britain, Saxony near Dresden, and the Dolomites. W. P. Haskett Smith is frequently called the Father of Rock Climbing in the British Isles, and Oskar Schuster was an early climber in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. *1886 : W. P. Haskett Smith makes the first ascent (in free solo style) of the 70 foot Napes Needle, in the Lake District of England. The resulting publicity introduces the general British public to the new sport of rock climbing. *1887 : Georg Winkler, at the age of 17, makes the first ascent - solo - of Die Vajolett√ºrme in the Dolomites, initiating the sport of rock climbing in that area. *1892 : Oscar Eckenstein, a British climber and early bouldering advocate, conducts a bouldering competition, with cash prizes, among the natives while on an expedition to the Karakoram Mountains.

He also suggests using equipment to ascend otherwise unclimbable rock, devises d√ºlfersitz rappelling technique. *1913 : Rudolf Fehrmann publishes the second edition of the guide book \\"Der Bergsteiger in der S√§chsischen Schweiz\\" (The Climber in Saxon Switzerland), which includes the first binding rules for climbing in the area. These include that only natural holds of the rock are allowed for climbing. These rules for Free climbing are still in use and haven't changed significantly. *1911 : Paul Preuss, an advocate of pure Free climbing, coins the term \\"artificial aid\\" to describe the use of mechanical aids, either to protect or progress up (or down!) a rock. His rule number four (of six) stated: \\"The piton is an emergency aid and not the basis of a system of mountaineering.\\" *:Note: The two principal uses of pitons on an ascent are as protective safeguards (not used for actual hand or footholds - climbers refrained from putting weight on them except in the event of a fall) and as direct aid (used to physically assist in ascending a steep or overhanging slope rather than merely as protection). Climbers like Paul Preuss and Geoffrey Winthrop Young argued strongly against direct aid, but others of that era, including Hans D√ºlfer and Tita Piaz, advocated using such devices as artificial aids in order to climb otherwise unscalable walls. After World War I most European climbers chose to employ artificial aid when necessary. However, from the beginning days of rock climbing as a sport, through the 1940s, another form of artificial assistance was at times employed by teams of two or more climbers: the shoulder stand. From our current perspective it seems odd that many of those climbers who strenuously objected to hanging on a piton found the shoulder stand to be quite acceptable. Occasionally, historical climbing photos, (e.g., ) illustrate this strategy, which arose from the perception that ascending a route was a team effort, with two climbers constituting one natural climbing unit. Something to keep in mind when reading of very early climbs in the 5.8 to 5.10 range. *1914 : Siegfried Herford and companions climb the Flake Pitch on Central Buttress of Scafell (5.9), England's hardest climb at the time. *1916 : Ivar Berg climbs Cave Ar√™te Indirect at Laddow Rocks, Derbyshire, England, the first E1.Craggs, Chris (2009). \\"Western Grit\\", Rockfax, Sheffield *1918 : Emanuel Strubich ascends The Wilder Kopf, Westkante in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, VIIIa (5.10c R/X), the world's hardest climb at the time, climbed without shoes. *1919 : Sees the publication of Guido Rey‚Äôs book, \\"Alpinisme Acrobatique\\", on the \\"artificial\\" techniques utilizing the latest, easily available pitons and carabiners =1920s=1920s - 1930s : Robert L.

Born in Garnish, Newfoundland and Labrador, Elliott grew up in a number of Newfoundland fishing outports, but spent most of his youth in Campbellton, Notre Dame Bay. He left school at age fifteen to become a telegraph operator and later served in World War II. In his memoir, A Soldier First, General Rick Hillier, retired Chief of Defence Staff of the Canadian Forces, recalls borrowing books from David Elliott while a boy growing up in Campbellton, and recounts the story that Elliott served in military intelligence during the Second World War.Hillier, General Rick, A Soldier First: Bullets, Bureaucrats and the Politics of War (Toronto: Harper Collins, 2009), 15-17. Elliott entered Memorial University of Newfoundland at the age of 25, where he won numerous scholarships and awards, graduating with a first-class degree in English Language and Literature. Following studies in psychology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, he worked for a time as a clinical psychologist in St. John's, and then as an editor with the Queen's Printer in Ottawa before returning to Memorial as a Ph.D. student in the early 1970s. In 1975, Elliott joined the faculty of the Sir Wilfred Grenfell College campus of Memorial University, where he taught until his retirement in 1989.Fowler, Adrian, \\"David Elliott's Return\\", Poetry Canada Review, 6:3 (Spring 1985), 20. After an initial burst of creativity, Elliott wrote little between the late 1950s and the late 1970s. Soon after his appointment to the English faculty at Grenfell College, however, inspired by an ambience that encouraged creative writing, he started to publish new poetry in literary magazines and anthologies, and began to receive invitations to read his work publicly. In 1982, a studio recording of him reading his poetry was included on the vinyl disc, Newfoundland Poets, Vol. 1 (Pigeon Inlet Productions). In 1988, his poetry was collected in The Edge of Beulah (St. John's: Breakwater Books). Elliott was one of the original performers at the literary festival, The March Hare, established in Corner Brook in the late 1980s, and in 1995 Fowler, Adrian, \\"The March Hare Anthology\\" (St. John's: Breakwater Books, 2007), p. 3 illustration. he was the first person to be honoured in having the festival for that year dedicated in his name, a practice that has since become an annual feature of the event.Fowler, Adrian, \\"Introduction\\", The March Hare Anthology (St. John's: Breakwater Books, 2007), vi-vii.

Vol. Liii. No. 2, St. John's, June, 1954. p. 30. it became one of the most anthologized contemporary Newfoundland poems. In it, Elliott portrays the apostle Thomas's disillusionment the day after the Crucifixion. An apparently simple narrative is complicated by language, which underscores the naked humanity of all the characters, and by point of view, which, in locating the monologue on the day between Christ's death and his resurrection, shows it to be time-limited. Having seen Christ walk to death between two thieves, \\"A little man whose face was cracked with fear, / And a tall man whose eyes were dull with doom\\", Thomas is overcome with biting shame for having believed easily. The poem ends in abandonment and despair as Thomas resolves to leave \\"this gray Jerusalem / where he lies sleeping in the hollowed stone, / Never to come into his kingdom now.\\" References Category:1923 births Category:1999 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian poets Category:20th- century Canadian male writers Category:Canadian male poets Category:Writers from Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"David Elliott (poet)"},{"id":"5979134","text":"Tea for Two is a 1950 American musical film directed by David Butler. The screenplay by Harry Clork and William Jacobs was inspired by the 1925 stage musical No, No, Nanette, although the plot was changed considerably from the original book by Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel; and the score by Harbach, Irving Caesar, and Vincent Youmans was augmented with songs by other composers. Plot Set as a flashback to in the Roaring Twenties, Uncle Max (S.Z. Sakall) tells the story of Nanette Carter (Doris Day), a Westchester socialite with show business aspirations. She offers to invest $25,000 in a Broadway show if her boyfriend, producer Larry Blair (Billy De Wolfe), casts her in the starring role. What she doesn't realize is Larry is two-timing her with ingenue Beatrice Darcy (Patrice Wymore), whom he envisions as the lead. When he accepts Nanette's offer, she imposes upon her wealthy, penny-pinching uncle, J. Maxwell Bloomhaus (S.Z. Sakall), to lend her the money. He's willing to do so, on one condition - for the next 24 hours, his niece must answer \\"no\\" to every question she's asked. Comic complications ensue when the cast arrives at Nanette's estate to rehearse; and composer and pianist Jimmy Smith (Gordon MacRae), who has romantic designs on the girl, falls victim to the bet she's made with her uncle. Nanette wins, only to discover Uncle Max has lost all his money in the stock market crash. The only person still solvent is attorney William Early (Bill Goodwin), and Nanette's assistant Pauline Hastings (Eve Arden) sets out to charm him into backing the show.

Though many of its attractions are still a part of the garden today, there have been changes throughout the history of the garden that have shaped it into what it is today. The oldest public Japanese garden in the United States, this complex of many paths, ponds and a teahouse features plants and trees pruned and arranged in a Japanese style. The garden's 3 acres contain sculptures and structures influenced by Buddhist and Shinto religious beliefs, as well as many elements of water and rocks to create a calming landscape designed to slow people down. History The tea garden in 1904 The Japanese Tea Garden began as the Japanese Village and Tea Garden at the 1894 World's Fair. It was built by Australian born George Turner Marsh, who hired Japanese craftsmen to construct the site. After the close of the fair, Marsh sold his concession to the city of San Francisco for $4,500. Makoto Hagiwara, a Japanese immigrant and gardener, was then hired to manage the garden. He personally oversaw the modification of the temporary Japanese Village fair exhibit to the permanent Japanese Tea Garden and was official caretaker of the garden for most of the time between 1895 to 1925. He imported from Japan many plants, birds, and the now famous koi fish, and he more than tripled the size of the garden. After San Francisco's 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition closed, the South Gate, the Temple Gate, and the Pagoda were acquired from that fair's Japanese exhibits. Following Makoto Hagiwara's death in 1925 his daughter, Takano Hagiwara, and her children became the proprietors and maintainers of the garden. With the onset of World War II in America and rising anti Japanese sentiment, Takano Hagiwara and her family were evicted from the family's home and sent to an internment camp. 120,000 Japanese and Americans of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps during the war. Despite John McLaren's agreement with Hagiwara, the displacement of his family disrupted their stay at a promised century long home and the family was not allowed back or reimbursed after the war ended. In the period of their absence, the garden was renamed \\"The Oriental Tea Garden,\\" and some structures expressing Japanese sentiment were demolished, including the Hagiwara home, and the original Shinto Shrine. Japanese tea servers were replaced with Chinese women in their traditional dress. In postwar 1952 the title \\"Japanese Tea Garden\\" was reinstated and the Hagiwara family offered minimal assistance in the beautification of the garden. The period that followed was one of reconciliation. In 1949, a bronze Buddha was donated by the Gump family. Because the 1951 Japanese Peace Treaty was signed in San Francisco, on January 8, 1953, Yasasuke Katsuno, the Japanese Consul General, presented a 9,000 pound Lantern of Peace. The lantern was commissioned in small donations by the children of Japan as a symbol of friendship toward future generations in the United States. At this time, Nagao Sakurai designed a \\"Peace Garden\\" and a karesansui or dry landscape garden. Karesansui are commonly referred to as Zen Gardens outside of Japan, but that name was assigned by those foreign to Japan. In 1974, a plaque contrived by artist, Ruth Asawa was gifted to the garden in honor of Makoto Hagiwara and his family for their dedication to the garden's beginnings and expansion. The San Francisco Recreation & Park Department, which has maintained the garden since 1942, named the road bordering the garden Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive in 1986 to further honor the garden's original benefactors.  Significant features  = The Tea House = The Tea House has been a part of the Japanese Tea Garden since its creation at the Mid-winter Fair in 1894, though it has been rebuilt several times. In a description of the garden published in 1950, at a time when it was \\"dubbed the Oriental Tea Garden\\" the author, Katherine Wilson, states that \\"further along from the Wishing Bridge was the thatched teahouse, where for three generations the women of the Hagiwara family, in their gaily, flowered kimonos, served tea and rice cakes.\\" Within Japanese Culture, the connection between the serenity of nature and the drinking of tea comes from a sacred tradition, the Japanese Tea Ceremony. The origin of the tea ceremony dates back to 1203 AD, \\"with Buddhist priests of the Zen sect, who found the infusion [tea] useful in keeping them awake during midnight devotions.\\" As it developed, the ceremony eventually earned the name Chanoyu, which, in literal translation means \\"hot water for tea.\\" Today, the heart of the tradition is the elegant making and pouring of whipped green tea, also called Matcha. When the \\"ceremony is well executed, an unspoken and perhaps inexpressible Zen quality lingers in the air.\\" As Tea Ceremonies became more widespread, they eventually became associated with the presence or nature, more specifically with the presence of a garden. Over time, the tea house became \\"the transcendent viewing place for contemplating the landscape\\" in a traditional tea garden.University of San Francisco students enjoy tea and snacks at the Tea House The Tea House is located by the water, and is surrounded by views of different aspects of the garden. The Tea House currently offers six kinds of tea: Jasmine, Sencha, H≈çjicha, Genmaicha, Green, and the traditional tea used in ceremonies, Matcha. It also offers a variety of snacks, some of which are savory including Edamame and Tea Sandwiches, and some of which are sweet including Kuzumochi and Green Tea Cheesecake. = \\"Treasure Tower\\" pagoda = The pagoda in the Japanese Tea Garden is a five-tiered Buddhist shrine. It, along with the Temple Gate, was built as a temporary indoor display for the Japanese section inside the Palace of Food Products at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition. After the conclusion of the PPIE, the pagoda and Temple Gate were moved into the Japanese Tea Garden. A pagoda is a narrow building with a multi-tiered roof style that originates from the Buddhist religion in India and East Asia. There are two types of pagodas: tombs, for high ranking Buddhist monks, and shrines, used for worship. The pagoda in this garden is the later. The pagoda in the garden was moved from its original spot about sixty feet West to where the Shinto shrine originally stood. Due to local anti-Japanese sentiment during WWII which led to the relocation of Japanese Americans, the Shinto shine was demolished and the Buddhist pagoda replaced the open space. This placement of the pagoda is strange in a religious context because it was within an area bounded by the ‚Äòmizugaki‚Äô, a traditional shinto picket fence. = Drum bridge (Moon Bridge) = A taiko bashi, or drum bridge is a highly arched pedestrian bridge found in Chinese and Japanese gardens. It is thus named because when reflected on the water, the full circle shape it creates resembles a drum. This design is also referred to as a Moon bridge. Today a bronze plaque at the bridge \\"recognizes the dedication and expertise of Shinshichi Nakatani for his unique contribution to the City and to the charm of the Japanese Tea Garden.\\" The bridge's Japanese design, which was adapted from the Chinese, has 3 main functions: to slow people down, to let barges on the canal go smoothly under the bridge, and to reflect a full circle on the water resembling a drum. = Karesansui - dry landscape garden = This part of the garden was designed by Nagao Sakurai and dedicated on January 8, 1953. A waterfall and a body of water are represented by large stones and gravel raked in waves. Islands are in the shape of tortoises, which are symbols of immortality and good luck. A karesansui, or dry landscape garden, is a style of Japanese garden where stones and gravel represent waterfalls, oceans, and mountains. Plants are sometimes, but not always, features in a karesansui garden. Entire landscapes can be represented by the use of thoughtfully arranged stone. The term ‚ÄúZen Garden‚Äù was coined by American author Lorraine Kuck in her 1935 book titled ‚ÄúOne Hundred Kyoto Gardens‚Äù. Although many of these gardens can be found at Zen Buddhist temples, karesansui are not exclusively associated with Zen.  Physical design elements  = Trees = The trees of the Japanese Tea Garden have more than a century-long history. The garden consists of a variety of trees, including flowering cherry trees, azaleas, magnolias, camellias, Japanese maples, pines, cedars and cypresses.Lagos, Marisa. \\"S.F. wants more of Japan in Tea Garden.\\" San Francisco Chronicle (CA) 16 Oct. 2008, 5star-dot, Metro: A1. NewsBank. Web. 3 Nov. 2015. The dwarf trees were planted by the Hagiwara family in the years following the Midwinter Exposition of 1894. However, when Japanese- Americans were thrown into internment camps in 1942, the dwarf trees left with the Hagiwara family. These trees were then sold to Dr. Hugh and Audrey Fraser, who in her will, entrusted the trees back to the Japanese Tea Garden. Samuel Newsom, an expert on Japanese Gardens and Japanese trees, redesigned the dwarf trees in 1965 after the dwarf trees returned to the garden. Newsom designed the dwarf trees onto the hillside, next to the waterfall, and, in 1966 planted more below the Temple Gate. Most of these dwarf trees originated in Japan, brought over by the Hagiwara family. The oldest tree was a Japanese black pine, which is now on a bamboo frame next to the Tea House. In 2005, the San Francisco Parks Trust and the San Francisco Recreation and Park Development repaired additional landscape and recognized the history of the trees via plaques. Today, the Monterey pine trees are among the more labor-intensive in the garden, according to previous landscape supervisor of Golden Gate Park, Ed Schuster. Every three years, the pines are layered into zig-zagged planes, creating an artistic design favored in traditional Japanese landscapes. These pines average sixty feet tall, so city arborists use ropes to climb to the tops and take great care pruning each tree.\\"ANOTHER WORLD THE JAPANESE TEA GARDEN IN GOLDEN GATE PARK OFFERS A PEACEFUL ESCAPE.\\" SACRAMENTO BEE 7 Mar. 1987, METRO FINAL, CAL LIFE: CL1.

Web. 3 Nov. 2015. = Water = Water commonly plays a large role in Japanese gardens and serves to highlight purity and liveliness. Ponds and waterfalls are often placed with precise orientations with respect to the sun to determine the reflection. In the native Japanese religion, ponds were created for sacred reasons as places for the gods to roam while the surrounding stones were utilized as seats. The auditory atmosphere of the Japanese Tea Garden is created through the blissful and peaceful sound of the moving water. Tsukubai, found in the Japanese Tea Garden, is a water basin originally used by guests to purify themselves before taking part in the tea ceremony. The dry garden at the Japanese Tea Garden represents the importance of water through wave patterns and artificial islands created by rocks. Water has remained an integral representation of Japanese Gardens and its connection to the elite world of immortals. = Rocks = Rocks are integral components of the traditional Japanese garden. They are generally thought of as the backbone of the arrangement of the space and as \\"dwelling places of gods, tokens of regal power, and symbols of longevity.\\" Rocks serve three main purposes in the garden, the first of which is mimicking larger natural formations such as mountains and bodies of water. The second purpose is to form rock clusters. In Japanese Gardens, rocks are often clustered with one large rock as the base stone. Others are arranged around it so they agree with the mood or order set forth by the base. Those groups of rocks often appear to have order and flow while remaining asymmetrical. Thirdly, rocks can also serve the purpose of guiding the eyes to other parts of the garden. They point viewers toward the focal point of the design of the garden. Paths and stepping-stones are formed in irregular patterns so people slow down and notice the design around them. In addition, Shinto is a fundamental principle in Japanese gardening where rocks have a decorative duty depending on their positions. A tall stone standing erect of the ground, for example, is associated to masculinity, while a low flat stone represents femininity, mirroring Shinto belief that all things in nature contain gender equilibrium. The Japanese Tea Garden is a mixture of influential Shinto and Buddhist religious beliefs.  Cultural and religious design  As a place of sacred ritual, a Japanese tea garden is highly representative of both Japanese culture and religious philosophy through the respected art forms of landscaping and architecture. Japanese aesthetics have been largely influenced by the geographic location of Japan, with emphases on isolation and the importance of water. Both Buddhist and Shinto religion can be seen in the design of the Japanese Tea Garden. = Japanese cultural aesthetics = The design of a Japanese tea garden is largely influenced by four main aesthetic principles in Japanese culture: miniaturization, concealment, extended scenery, and asymmetry.  Miniaturization  Miniaturization is the principle of evoking the entire of spirit of nature in a limited physical space (the Japanese Tea Garden of San Francisco is only 5 acres). It also encompasses the use of small stones and other small elements to represent the yin-yang. The Buddhist value of yin-yang expresses the incomplete and dynamic nature of everything around us. The yin-yang symbolizes multiple parts that come together to create a larger whole, and that nothing on its own is entirely whole or static. The coming together of water and stone is symbolic of the yin-yang in numerous locations throughout the San Francisco Japanese Tea Garden, as seen in the waterfalls, water basins made of stone, flat stones across the ponds, and waves in the stones of the dry Zen Garden.  Concealment  The aesthetics of the garden are further influenced by the principle of concealment, which involves messages that come in pieces to ultimately reveal a larger picture. For example, the dragon hedge of the Japanese Tea Garden only reveals itself as a dragon after being followed from tail to head.  Extended scenery  Extended scenery makes the limited space of the garden appear larger with the use of natural elements around its outside. Although the Japanese Tea Garden is located in the city of San Francisco, one cannot tell the garden is surrounded by an urban scene when inside. It is encompassed in tall greenery that visually extend the size of the garden.  Asymmetry  The fourth principle, asymmetry, is in some ways a continuation of the yin-yang. Asymmetry stresses the abstract and ever- changing nature of everything around us. This aesthetic principle is largely representative of the Buddhist principle of Wabi-sabi, which states that all things are imperfect, irregular, and impermanent. This principle is shown in the garden through the winding pathways, stones of many different sizes, and abstract placements of objects. Additionally, the changing of the waves in the dry Zen Garden is a tradition that honors wabi-sabi. = Religious design = thumb The distinctive and particular architecture and design of the Japanese Tea Garden is influenced by various aspects of Japanese culture and, more specifically, Japanese religion. The most prominent of these being the ancient Japanese religion of Shintoism. The significance of various elements in the garden can be attributed to the fundamental principles and characteristics of Shintoism, Buddhism, and even Taoism. All of these religions have a large emphasis on the importance of nature, and the importance of being one with nature. The placement of rocks, the way the water flows, the route of the paths, the placement of the trees, everything has to be done in such a way that promotes a natural flow, as emphasized in Taoism. In Shintoism, it is believed that the spirits of ancestors, and spirits of the gods themselves, are manifested in nature. These spirits are called Kami, and these Kami are what determine the fortune of those living on Earth. The garden is designed so as to promote the happiness of these spirits, and to properly coexist with them. Cleanliness is also greatly emphasized in Shintoism, which can also be noticed in the structure of the park, the park is not meant to appear crowded or difficult to navigate. In addition, the waterfall found in the garden is symbolic to the fact that cleansing of bad spirits by waterfall is considered the purest way to cleanse oneself in Shintoism. Though the design is meant to convey many different elements of nature, flow, and Zen, all fundamentals in Buddhism, it is done simply.  Steep stairs  Many aesthetic elements of the garden catch the attention of tourists and can be traced back to Buddhist philosophy. The steep stairs in the garden are an element of nearly every center devoted to Buddhism. It is believed in Buddhism that Zen can be reached through stair climbing, as movement is often incorporated into meditation. In this way, sport/fitness can help achieve the connection between mind, body, and spirit. Many monks and nuns include exercise in their daily routines. It is also believed that Buddha himself said, \\"Good health is the highest gain.\\" The steep stairs are also a reference to the climb Buddha made to the top of Vulture Peak, his favorite place of meditation. The climb is now made of 1500 steps up a steep hill.  Stone lanterns  The stone lanterns seen around the garden, like the Lantern of Peace that followed World War II, are representative of the five elements of Buddhism. The bases of the lanterns symbolize the earth, while the next section is water, the light is fire, and the following two sections symbolize the air and spirit respectively. The lanterns as a whole symbolize the coming together of all five elements in the harmony of nature, another example of wabi-sabi.A decorative moon bridge in the Tea Garden  Gallery Image:Japanese Tea Garden, San Francisco.jpg Image:Japanese Tea Garden.jpg Image:GoldenGateParkJapaneseGardenEntry.jpg Image:Japaneseteagardensf.jpg File:San Francisco Japanese Garden.jpg Image:Buddhastatuesf.jpg Image:Japanese Tea Garden (San Francisco, California).jpg File:Japanese Gardens Buddha.jpg File:Japanese Gardens Flowers 1.jpg File:Japanese Gardens Flowers 2.jpg File:Japanese Gardens Flowers 4.jpg File:Lantern in the Japanese Garden 1.jpg File:Japanese Gardens Gift Shop offerings 3.jpg File:Lantern in the Japanese Garden 5.jpg File:Japanese Garden SF3.jpg Notes References #Jennifer 8.

His brother, Luis Fernando, is also a manager and former footballer. He is also the father of footballer Alfredo Omar. Playing career Tena debuted with Club Am√©rica during the 1973‚Äì74 season, in a game against rivals Cruz Azul, after coming up through the club's youth system. Soon after, Tena secured a regular spot in the √Åguilas backfield. During his career at Club Am√©rica, Tena won numerous titles. During the 1980s, Am√©rica won six league titles, as well as the Mexican League Champions' Cup trophies after the 1987‚Äì88 and 1988‚Äì89 seasons, and achieving international success as well with by winning three CONCACAF Champions' Cup titles in 1978, 1987, and 1991 and two Copa Interamericana cups in 1978 and 1991. Tena was known for his skill and tough marking skills, as well as his sometimes gruff attitude with both opposing players and teammates, a trait that earned him the \\"Captain Fury\\" moniker. In July 1991, Tena announced the end of his career with Am√©rica, saying: \\"I have faithfully served this team for so long, all I can say is thank you all for the years of playoffs, championship titles, team mates and all the memories we have made\\". Tena would go off to play for Tecos UAG for the 1991‚Äì1992 season, before retiring officially from professional football in 1992. Coaching career Shortly after his retirement, Tena decided to pursue success from the bench, as a coach. In 1996, he took a job at Santos Laguna, leading them to a title during the Invierno 1996 season. Tena remained at the helm of the Torre√≥n based club until his dismissal in 1998, never being able to duplicate the success of his lone title two years prior. After short stints coaching Puebla and his former team Club Am√©rica, Tena once again experienced success at the head of Pachuca, winning the league after the Invierno 2001 season. After leaving Pachuca in 2003, he returned to Club Am√©rica, this time as an assistant to his brother Luis Fernando. In 2011, Tena was named interim- manager of Am√©rica, replacing Carlos Reinoso. He was dismissed after a calamitous campaign and was replaced by Miguel Herrera. In 2012, he was named as assistant manager to Javier Aguirre at La Liga club Espanyol.

One of four central business districts outside Downtown Toronto, it is bounded by Rathburn Road to the north, Islington Avenue to the east, Bloor Street to the south, Mimico Creek to the west. History Islington centres on a commercial strip along Dundas Street West (originally The Governor's Road, the first highway connecting Toronto to London, Ontario) which runs along an escarpment (the Lake Iroquois Shoreline, ancient shore of Lake Iroquois) across the width of Etobicoke. To the west where Kipling Avenue crosses Dundas Street West (and Bloor Street West) is the Six Points intersection, the central point in Etobicoke's grid. To the east, Dundas Street crosses the Mimico Creek. The original community called Mimico grew west of Montgomery's Inn, which was built in 1832 at Dundas Street West and Islington Avenue (beside the Mimico Creek) to serve travellers coming or going from Toronto to western Ontario along Dundas St. Unlike the better-known Montgomery's Tavern in Toronto, Montgomery's Inn was used by soldiers remaining loyal to the government during the 1837 rebellion. Etobicoke was officially incorporated as a township in 1850, first using Montgomery's Inn for its meetings until the nearby original Methodist Church was purchased. The former Etobicoke Council Offices are located in Islington. Etobicoke's first cemetery began with the burial of a traveller on Dundas who died on his way to Toronto just before reaching Montgomery's Inn. Despite the dying man's request to be buried in Toronto, he was buried beside the Methodist Church (later the Etobicoke Council Offices) in Islington. This cemetery remains a prominent historic site in the heart of Etobicoke where many of Etobicoke's early families are buried. With the building of the first railway to Toronto from the west in 1855, Mimico, near Lake Ontario, petitioned the government for a post office to be called Mimico in 1858. In 1860, the original northern Mimico petitioned for its own post office, using the name Islington, which was suggested by the wife of Montgomery's Innkeeper who was born in Islington, England (now a part of London). A second railway was built at the bottom of the escarpment (just south of Dundas) preventing the collapse of Islington during the railway age. This neighbourhood was also the site of Etobicoke's annual rural fair. In the early 20th century, Etobicoke's urbanizing lakeshore communities separated to become independent municipalities while Islington remained a postal village, the administrative centre of rural Etobicoke Township. The Etobicoke municipal offices were greatly enlarged at this time. Islington station, a subway station for the Toronto subway. Urbanization began in central Etobicoke in the 1950s post war boom with growing residential areas in Islington and to the north and industrial growth to the south. This led to Etobicoke's incorporation which separated from the County of York to form a part of the new Metropolitan Toronto in 1954, reincorporating the lakeshore municipalities into that level of government. With growing traffic along Dundas and increasing traffic fatalities in Islington, the intersections of Royal York Road and Kipling Avenue with Dundas St. W. were redesigned as highway style interchanges with bridges. The new Borough of Etobicoke in 1967 created several plans to raise the level of commercial and residential density in Islington with the aim of creating a western 'downtown' for Metropolitan Toronto. The Toronto Transit Commission's Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line was extended into Etobicoke as far as Islington in 1968 with the establishment of Islington station at Islington Avenue and Bloor Street West. After the station was constructed, there was a boom in high-density office and residential development. In 1980, the Bloor-Danforth line was extended one stop west from Islington to Kipling and GO Transit's Kipling GO Station, further enhancing the neighbourhood's access to Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. =Interchange construction and removal= The physical segregation of Islington with the redesigning of the surrounding interchanges on Dundas Street West (at Kipling Avenue and at Royal York Road) as well as Etobicoke Council's move in 1958 to a new complex beside the new Highway 427, limited the success of plans for the area to be developed as a western downtown. Efforts began in 1998 by the Borough of Etobicoke to intensify the Six Points area were carried over to the amalgamated City of Toronto government. Beginning in March 2017, redevelopment of the Bloor Street, Kipling Avenue and Dundas Street West interchanges and the Westwood Theatre lands began by the Build Toronto agency to create a mixed-use development. The highway- interchange style of the intersection is being replaced by at-grade intersections (overpass to be removed 2019-2020), restoring pedestrian connectivity to the area. Dundas Street will be re-routed (via existing Dunbloor Road) on a new path through the area.https://www.blogto.com/city/2017/02/torontos-worst-intersection-about-be- completely-rebuilt/https://urbantoronto.ca/news/2019/02/six-points- reconfiguration-dundas-moves-new-alignment =Heritage preservation= A historic mural depicting a historic rendition of Dundas Street in Islington. A heated debate over the demolition of the Montgomery's home (Briarly) beside Montgomery's Inn in the 1980s led to a greater emphasis on the historic nature of the area. Montgomery's Inn has been preserved as the Etobicoke Community Museum and is open to the public. There is also a designated business improvement district known as the Historic Village of Islington, which has commissioned a large number of historic wall murals along Dundas St. W. Education The neighbourhood is home to schools operated by the public Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). *Islington Junior Middle School (IJMS) is a K-8 elementary junior and middle school established since 1832 and it is the second oldest school in Toronto as well as the oldest in the former Etobicoke. * Two of Etobicoke's first Roman Catholic high schools of the Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church, St. Joseph's High School was founded in 1949 by the Sisters of St. Joseph as an all-girls school and in 1957, the Basilian Fathers formed an all-boys school, Michael Power High School on the Bloor-Dundas area and Michael Power later became an co-educational school in its later years. In 1982, they were officially amalgamated as one school with the Basilian Father as principal and the Sister of St. Joseph as vice-principal. With the school moved up west and north in 1993, Bishop Allen Academy opened in 1989 to fill in the void left by the relocation of Michael Power-St. Joseph.

He was born in Ribe, Denmark. Ever since he was a small child, Olsen was interested in clocks and other mechanical devices. After hearing of the broken clock in Carsten Hauch's A Polish Family, he dreamed of fixing that clock. Later, he envisioned a clock that would show every conceivable type of time, from sidereal time to the rotation of the planets. Olsen's father was a weaver but apprenticed Olsen to a locksmith. However, he remained interested in clocks and read as much as he could about them and later astronomy. Even after ending his apprenticeship and becoming a locksmith Olsen continued to pursue these interests. In 1897, Olsen became a journeyman and eventually ended up in Strasbourg where he saw the famous clock built by Jean-Baptiste Schwilgu√© in the cathedral. He would hide in a corner near the clock, so that he could see and examine it past the viewing hours. After Strasbourg, Olsen moved to Switzerland where he switched to clockmaking entirely. After eighteen months in Paris and a five months stay in London, he returned to Denmark to work as a superintendent at Cornelius Knudsen's establishment. At the same time he had his own business as a clockmaker. In 1905, he married Anna Sofie Kr√∂ldrup, and established his shop at her home. When he was about fifty, Olsen completed his calculations for the world clock he envisioned. He showed them to Professor Elis Str√∂mgren who approved them. However, it took another twenty years to acquire the funds necessary to build the clock. ¬´ In 1943, when he was 71 years old, and Denmark was under German occupation, the Technological Institute of Copenhagen placed a workshop and staff at his disposal and work on the clock began in earnest. After his death in 1945 his colleague, Otto Mortensen, took over the project and, after its successful completion in 1955, prepared a detailed monograph.

RPC refers to liquid (rather than gas) chromatography. Stationary phases In the 1970s, most liquid chromatography was performed using a solid support stationary phase (also called a column) containing unmodified silica or alumina resins. This type of technique is now referred to as normal-phase chromatography. Since the stationary phase is hydrophilic in this technique, molecules with hydrophilic properties contained within the mobile phase will have a high affinity for the stationary phase, and therefore will adsorb to the column packing. Hydrophobic molecules experience less of an affinity for the column packing, and will pass through to be eluted and detected first. Elution of the hydrophilic molecules adsorbed to the column packing requires the use of more hydrophilic or more polar solvents in the mobile phase to shift the distribution of the particles in the stationary phase towards that of the mobile phase. Reversed-phase chromatography is a technique using alkyl chains covalently bonded to the stationary phase particles in order to create a hydrophobic stationary phase, which has a stronger affinity for hydrophobic or less polar compounds. The use of a hydrophobic stationary phase is essentially the reverse of normal phase chromatography, since the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases have been inverted ‚Äì hence the term reversed-phase chromatography. Reversed-phase chromatography employs a polar (aqueous) mobile phase. As a result, hydrophobic molecules in the polar mobile phase tend to adsorb to the hydrophobic stationary phase, and hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will pass through the column and are eluted first.(Clinical Biochemistry, T.W.Hrubey, 54) Hydrophobic molecules can be eluted from the column by decreasing the polarity of the mobile phase using an organic (non-polar) solvent, which reduces hydrophobic interactions. The more hydrophobic the molecule, the more strongly it will bind to the stationary phase, and the higher the concentration of organic solvent that will be required to elute the molecule. Many of the mathematical and experimental considerations used in other chromatographic methods also apply to RPC (for example, the separation resolution is dependent on the length of the column). It can be used for the separation of a wide variety of molecules. It is not typically used for separation of proteins, because the organic solvents used in RPC can denature many proteins. For this reason, normal phase chromatography is more commonly used for separation of proteins. However, the denaturation of proteins may actually be beneficial in the later analysis of the samples obtained from the chromatography. If an enzymatic digestion with trypsin is performed on the proteins analysed, linearised protein is more suitable for this. Hence, the denaturation of proteins using appropriate solvents which cause the unfolding of the proteins can actually be intentional before taking the fractionated sample through mass spectrometry. Today, RPC is a frequently used analytical technique. There are a variety of stationary phases available for use in RPC, allowing great flexibility in the development of separation methods. =Silica-based stationary phases= Any inert polar substance that achieves sufficient packing can be used for reversed-phase chromatography. The most popular column is an octadecyl carbon chain (C18)-bonded silica (USP classification L1). This is followed by C8-bonded silica (L7), pure silica (L3), cyano-bonded silica (L10) and phenyl-bonded silica (L11). Note that C18, C8 and phenyl are dedicated reversed-phase resins, while cyano columns can be used in a reversed-phase mode depending on analyte and mobile phase conditions. Not all C18 columns have identical retention properties. Surface functionalization of silica can be performed in a monomeric or a polymeric reaction with different short-chain organosilanes used in a second step to cover remaining silanol groups (end-capping). While the overall retention mechanism remains the same, subtle differences in the surface chemistries of different stationary phases will lead to changes in selectivity. Modern columns have different polarity. PFP is pentafluorphenyl. CN is cyano. NH2 is amino. ODS is octadecyl or C18. ODCN is a mixed mode column consisting of C18 and nitrile. SCX is strong cationic exchange (used for separation of organic amines). SAX is strong anionic exchange (used for separation of carboxylic acid compounds). Mobile phases Mixtures of water or aqueous buffers and organic solvents are used to elute analytes from a reversed-phase column. The solvents must be miscible with water, and the most common organic solvents used are acetonitrile, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Other solvents can be used such as ethanol or 2-propanol (isopropyl alcohol). Elution can be performed isocratically (the water-solvent composition does not change during the separation process) or by using a solution gradient (the water-solvent composition changes during the separation process, usually by decreasing the polarity). The pH of the mobile phase can have an important role on the retention of an analyte and can change the selectivity of certain analytes. Charged analytes can be separated on a reversed-phase column by the use of ion-pairing (also called ion-interaction). This technique is known as reversed-phase ion-pairing chromatography.

The brigade, known as the Hampshire Brigade, served in British India during the First World War but not as a complete formation. During the Second World War the 128th Infantry Brigade fought in the final stages of the North African Campaign in late in Tunisia and the Italian Campaign, and later in the Greek Civil War. Throughout its existence the brigade was composed almost entirely of battalions of the Hampshire Regiment (later Royal Hampshire Regiment). History =Formation= The Hampshire Brigade was originally formed on 1 April 1908, when the Territorial Force was created by the amalgamation of the Volunteer Force and the Yeomanry. The brigade was attached to the Wessex Division and was composed of four battalions of the Hampshire Regiment, the 4th (Winchester), 5th (Southampton), 6th (Portsmouth) and 7th (Bournemouth). =First World War= The Wessex Division was mobilised in early August 1914 and was sent overseas to British India in September to free up Regular Army troops for service on the Western Front in France and Belgium. In May 1915 the division was numbered as 43rd (Wessex) Division and the brigade was also numbered, becoming 128th (1st Hampshire) Brigade and the battalions became '1/4th Hampshires', for example, to differentiate them from their 2nd Line duplicates, the 134th (2/1st Hampshire) Brigade of the 45th (2nd Wessex) Division. However, the division, and the brigade, never saw action as a complete unit and was disbanded later in the war. Some of its component units did see active service in the Mesopotamian campaign. First World War order of battle 1/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (left March 1915) * 1/5th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment * 1/6th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (left September 1917) * 1/7th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (left January 1918) =Between the wars= The Territorial Force was disbanded shortly after the war ended but reformed in the 1920s as the Territorial Army. The brigade was reformed in the Territorial Army, as the 128th (Hampshire) Infantry Brigade, in 1920 and was again part of the 43rd Division and again included four battalions of the Hampshire Regiment. However, the composition of the brigade changed over the years. The 5th and 7th battalions were merged in 1923 to become the 5th/7th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment They were replaced in the brigade by the 8th (Isle of Wight Rifles) Battalion, Hampshire Regiment. In 1937 the 8th (Isle of Wight Rifles) Battalion was converted to the Royal Artillery role as The Princess Beatrice's (Isle of Wight Rifles) Heavy Regiment. The following year, in 1938, all infantry brigades of the British Army were reduced from four infantry battalions to three. As a consequence of this, the 6th (Duke of Connaught's Own) Battalion, Hampshire Regiment was, like the 8th Battalion, transferred to the Royal Artillery and redesignated the 59th (Duke of Connaught's Own) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery and became the anti-tank regiment for the 43rd Division. They were replaced in the brigade by the 4th Battalion, Dorset Regiment, originally from the 129th (South Western) Infantry Brigade. The brigade, shortly afterwards, was redesignated the 128th Infantry Brigade. In the spring and summer of 1939 the Territorial Army was doubled in size and all units were ordered to form a duplicate unit and the 4th Battalion was split in two, to create the 1/4th and 2/4th battalions and 5th/7th Battalion was split into the 5th and 7th battalions. However, unlike, most Territorial divisions which formed an exact 'mirror' duplicate of 2nd Line units, the 43rd (Wessex) was instead split on a geographical basis. The units from Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire remained with the 43rd Division and units from Devonshire, Somerset and Cornwall joined the 45th Infantry Division. Therefore, the newly raised 7th Hampshire Regiment and the 4th Dorset Regiment were both transferred to the 130th Infantry Brigade. The 128th Brigade kept the 1/4th and 5th Hampshires, two 1st Line units, and the 2/4th Battalion, a 2nd Line unit. =Second World War= During the Second World War the 128th Brigade was mobilised in September 1939, soon after the outbreak of war. The brigade continued to serve with the 43rd Division and was preparing to go overseas to the Franco-Belgian border to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The brigade was at the time commanded by Brigadier Frederick Browning, a Regular Army officer of the Grenadier Guards. However, the BEF's retreat and evacuation from Dunkirk during the Battle of France cancelled these plans and the division instead remained in Kent on the defensive and prepared for a potential German invasion of England. Men of the 2nd Battalion, Hampshire Regiment move up to their last objective before the Gothic Line, Italy, 27 August 1944. On 6 June 1942 the 43rd (Wessex) Division was reorganised as a 'Mixed Division' and 34th Tank Brigade arrived to replace the 128th Infantry. The brigade was, therefore, transferred to the 46th Infantry Division on 15 August, and would remain with the division for the rest of the war. The 128th Brigade remained with the 46th for the rest of the war. With this division the brigade served in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa in particular bearing the brunt of the German offensive in Northern Tunisia during Operation Ochsenkopf in the Spring of 1943. After the Axis surrender in May 1943 it then went on to fight in the Italian Campaign from September 1943 until late 1944, when it was sent to Greece to help calm the Greek Civil War. The 128th Infantry Brigade fought in many battles in Italy including the Salerno landings in September 1943, Naples and at the Gothic Line. It ended the war in Austria.

He was a recognised authority on Irish traditional music and lectured extensively on the subject. He travelled around Ireland, England, Scotland and America collecting music. According to Sam Smyth in the Irish Independent, Mac Math√∫na was \\"on a mission to collect songs and stories, music, poetry and dance before they were buried under the coming tsunami of pop music\\". He presented Mo Cheol Th√∫ for 35 years. Upon his retirement in 2005, the managing director of RT√â Radio, Adrian Moynes, described Mac Math√∫na as \\"inseparable from RT√â Radio\\". Upon his death in 2009, the Irish Independent described him as \\"a national treasure\\". Early life and education Mac Math√∫na was born in Limerick, spending his early years in Mulgrave Street. He was schooled at CBS Sexton St, and later graduated from University College, Dublin with a BA in modern Irish and Latin. Subsequently, he completed an MA in Irish.The Irish Times, \\"BELOVED JOURNEYMAN\\", 1 February 1996 Career After college Mac Math√∫na worked as a teacher and later at the Placenames Commission. In 1954, he joined Radio √âireann where his job was to record Irish traditional musicians playing in their own locales. This entailed visiting such places as Sliabh Luachra, County Clare and County Sligo, and the resulting recordings featured in his radio programmes: * Ceolta Tire * A Job of Journeywork ‚Äî listened to by Johnny McEvoy * Humours of Donnybrook ‚Äî Al O'Donnell and Luke Kelly performed a famous version of \\"On Raglan Road\\" on this show in 1979 Director-General of RT√â Cathal Goan later recalled that Mac Math√∫na interviewed him for his first job at the station. Goan assisted in the organisation of Mac Math√∫na's music collection for the RT√â Libraries and Archives. Mac Math√∫na's long-running Sunday morning radio series Mo Cheol Th√∫ (You are my music) began in 1970 and continued until November 2005, when he retired from broadcasting. Each 45-minute programme offered a miscellany of archive music, poetry and folklore, mainly of Irish origin. It was one of radio's longest running programmes. The last episode was broadcast on 27 November 2005 at 8.10 am. Mac Math√∫na won two Jacob's Awards, in 1969 and 1990, for his RT√â Radio programmes promoting Irish traditional music. He received the Freedom of Limerick city in June 2004. He was also awarded honorary doctorates by NUI Galway and the University of Limerick.The Irish Times, \\"'The thrill was in the pursuit of the tunes, as much as it was in their capture' \\", 26 November 2005 In 2007, he received the Musicians Award at the 10th annual TG4 Traditional Music Awards. Joe Kennedy in the Sunday Independent in 2007 compared Mac Math√∫na to \\"an amiable rock, rolling gently along, still picking up some moss and morsels of music that he may have missed\\". Personal and later life His wife Dolly MacMahon (using the English version of her surname) was a singer of traditional songs. She came from Galway and met her husband in 1955. He had two sons named Padraic and Ciar√°n, one daughter named D√©irdre, and four grandchildren at the time of his death: Eoin, Colm, Conor and Liam. He died on 11 December 2009. Taoiseach Brian Cowen paid tribute, saying: ‚ÄúHe was encyclopaedic in his knowledge of Irish traditional music and its artists and for many decades, wherever good Irish music was played and enjoyed, Ciar√°n was to be found in its midst‚Äù. Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen described Mac Math√∫na as \\"a man of great intellect with a wonderful commitment to and understanding of Irish folklore and the traditional arts\\". Niall Stokes, editor of Hot Press, spoke of being \\"in the process of losing a great generation of Irish folk pioneers\\" ‚Äî musician Liam Clancy had died just days previously ‚Äì and called for a \\"[continuation of] justice to the extraordinary work they did in reviving the true spirit of Irish folk and traditional music and re-instating it at the heart of the Irish experience [...] in our public policy, and in particular our broadcasting framework\\". A billboard advertisement for Mo Cheol Th√∫ with the caption ‚ÄúThe Touch of the Master‚Äôs Hand‚Äô‚Äô was positioned in Terenure College Chapel where his corpse was carried. Mac Math√∫na's funeral on 15 December 2009 was attended by hundreds of people, including aides-de-camp of the President and Taoiseach, RT√â Director-General Cathal Goan, poet S√©amus Heaney and others. Heaney said at the funeral: > Over a lifetime he helped the population of Ireland to realise the beauty, > strength and value of their native cultural possessions, above all their > musical culture. The musical instrument which Ciaran played to magical > effect, and which entranced generations of listeners, was his own voice. Musicians to perform at the ceremony included Peadar √ì R√≠ada, C√≥r C√∫il Aodha and members of The Chieftains and Planxty. The corpse was then taken to Mount Jerome Crematorium. Journalist Kevin Myers said Mac Math√∫na's legacy would be the \\"rebirth of Irish music\\", adding: > Well, if Ciar√°n Mac Math√∫na can die, I suppose anyone can. Actually, I had > always thought that he was immortal. He certainly appeared to have all the > ingredients.

He is known for his unorthodox, spontaneous, and daring style of presenting wildlife documentaries as well as for including factual knowledge in the proceedings. This has led some people to compare him to Steve Irwin. Nigel ran the 2008 London marathon in 4 hours 4 minutes to try to raise ¬£20,000 for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society UK.  Career  = Early life and career (1982‚Äì1999)= Marven was born in Barnet but grew up in St. Albans. As a child he loved animals. His first pet was a hamster called Hummy. He kept stick insects, boa constrictors and even an eel in a bath. When he was 15, he also owned young spectacled caiman. Nigel studied botany at the University of Bristol until the age of 22 when he left to begin his career at the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol. Over the following years, Nigel worked firstly as a wildlife documentary researcher for such programmes as The First Eden and My Family and Other Animals, then went on to produce such series as Realms of the Russian Bear. He enjoyed a 12-year professional collaboration with David Attenborough whom he holds in high esteem. In 1998, he moved to ITV where he was asked to present wildlife documentaries as well as producing them. In his first television series for ITV, Giants, he swam with a great white shark without the protection of a cage. Other scenes included a goliath birdeater spider, arguably the largest spider in the world, walking over his face, and Marven grappling a fifteen- foot African rock python deep in its underground lair. This style of presenting has won him many viewers and to date he has presented more than 40 wildlife programs and series for TV. =Shark Week host and dinosaur programmes (2000‚Äì2009)= In 2000, Nigel became the host of the hit annual Discovery Channel event Shark Week, and held this role for three years. In 2002, the Impossible Pictures production company asked him to present the Walking with Dinosaurs Special episodes \\"The Giant Claw\\" and \\"Land of Giants\\", which premiered to nearly seven million viewers in late 2002. In 2003, he also hosted Sea Monsters ‚Äì A Walking with Dinosaurs Trilogy. He then moved on to Prehistoric Park in 2006, a fictional series about travelling back in time to rescue examples of extinct creatures such as Tyrannosaurus, Woolly Mammoth, Arthropleura and others. In 2009, Marven featured in season 3, episode 4 of the hit action drama series Primeval, where he is seen playing with a baby Velociraptor before encountering a Giganotosaurus, which, it is implied, eats him off-screen. Both Prehistoric Park and Primeval were also made by Impossible Pictures. Along with the time-travelling programmes, Marven founded his own independent company Image Impact in 2003, and started producing his own wildlife films, including a few one-hour specials and then series, such as Penguin Safari and Panda Adventure, both which aired on Channel 5 and Animal Planet. In 2007, he also worked with Tigress Productions which resulted in his shows Shark Island and Jaguar Adventure. =Later years (2010‚Äìpresent)= In the first half of the 2010s, Nigel produced nature documentaries such as Untamed China, Wild Colombia, Whale Adventure and Nigel Marven's Cruise Ship Adventures, the latter which was broadcast in May and June 2015 on Watch. During the summer of 2014, Eden Channel in the UK started a new competition for aspiring wildlife filmmakers called Eden Shorts. The task was to make one- minute videos with animals, with the best ones to be shown on TV. Nigel Marven, along with Michaela Strachan, were judges. Nigel has also made some short how-to-guides, available through Eden Channel's website. In May 2015, Eden premiered a film called Eden Shorts: From Lens to Screen presented by Marven. In the show, he meets competition finalists and reveals techniques used to shoot their videos. One of his more recent successes, Ten Deadliest Snakes, was first broadcast on Animal Planet in the U.S in spring 2014, and on Eden in the UK in June of the same year. Season 2 of Ten Deadliest Snakes premiered in autumn 2015 on Eden, while season 3 began airing on 5 January 2017 on Nat Geo Wild in the UK. Highlights of Ten Deadliest Snakes included, among others, visiting sea krait caves in South China Sea and handling black mamba in South Africa. In January 2018, Nigel's Untamed Philippines was screened on Nat Geo Wild in the USA. The presenter-led version of this documentary called Wild Philippines with Nigel Marven aired on Viasat Nature in Europe in March and April 2018 and on Animal Planet India in June 2018, with the American TV channel PBS airing the series in late summer 2019. As of October 2020, Nigel Marven's newest series is Wild Central America, a documentary consisting of four episodes, each looking at wildlife of a different Central American country, with focus on Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama. While Wild Honduras premiered on Viasat Nature in summer 2019, the rest of the series aired on the same channel in late spring and summer 2020. The presenter-less version of Wild Costa Rica and Wild Guatemala however, premiered on Nat Geo Wild in February 2020. In September 2020, Blue Meridian and Crytivo released the official trailer for the video game Prehistoric Kingdom, with Nigel Marven narrating it. On 30 September, the day after the trailer's release, the creative team behind the game confirmed in a live stream that they had approached Nigel to narrate the trailer after they saw that he followed the game's official page on Twitter. = Close encounters = Marven was bitten by a venomous green pit viper in East Malaysian state Sabah in the summer 2014 during filming the first episode of the show called Eating Wild. The snake bit him on the thumb but did not inject too much venom, so Marven spent 6 hours in the hospital, until he had recovered. He has also had a few other very dangerous encounters with venomous snakes. While he was producing the BBC film The Serpent's Embrace in 1980s, a spitting cobra sprayed its venom into his eyes. He spent 2‚Äì3 days in hospital, though luckily the venom did not enter his blood. A similar encounter happened in December 2008 while Marven was making a short film about black-necked spitting cobras for Webosaurs. Though he wore a mask, the cobra venom landed in Marven's hair, then mixed with sweat and ran into his eyes, so he stopped the filming until next morning. In his 2008 series Jaguar Adventure he was bitten by a mildly toxic venomous false water cobra. His hand swelled up within ten minutes, but there were no other harmful effects. In his 2004 nature documentary Bull Shark: World's Deadliest Shark Nigel Marven was in Bahamas and stood with shark expert Erich Ritter in the water surrounded by sharks. During the filming, a bull shark attacked Ritter's leg and gave him a 30 centimetre bite to his calf. Marven still recalls it as one of the most dangerous moments in his career.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/celebrity-interviews/Nigel- Marven-the-adventure-interview/ Telegraph.co.uk: Nigel Marven: the adventure interview In 2005,http://www.nigelmarven.com/photo.asp?g=3 while filming the Indian rhinoceros in Kaziranga National Park, Marven and his crew unknowingly got too close to a female rhino with a small calf; the mother rhino charged at them, but since they were riding in a truck, they were able to outdistance her. Marven later said that this experience was the most exciting moment in his entire film-making career. In the third episode of his 2012 series, Wild Colombia, Marven was bitten by a non-venomous Central American tree boa on his nose, causing blood to cover his face. A similar encounter happened in his 2013 show Ten Deadliest Snakes: China with a king ratsnake. Likewise, in Ten Deadliest Snakes: Brazil from 2017, he got bitten on the nose by a non- venomous green vine snake. =Conservation= Nigel Marven is a Panda Ambassador for Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan Province, China. He is also a patron of The Great Fen Project for restoring vital wildlife habitat, Healthy Planet through which he adopted a plot of land for helping to create new wildlife habitats, and Vale Wildlife Hospital, company that treats injured wildlife in Gloucestershire, England. He is also a patron of the ORCA organization, which protects whales and dolphins in European waters.http://www.orcaweb.org.uk/news/wildlife-tv-presenter-nigel-marven- joins-as-an-orca-patron Nigel Marven joins as an ORCA patron Many of his TV wildlife programmes also seek to highlight the conservation of nature and endangered species. For example, his series Panda Adventure provides a look at giant pandas breeding program in Chengdu Panda Base in China and in San Diego Zoo in the US. In 2016, Nigel Marven produced and narrated a short film featuring the work of Black Mamba Anti-Poaching Unit, who are fighting against rhino poaching in South Africa. The film is available to watch via internet and is presented by animal campaigner Anneka Svenska.http://www.annekasvenska.com/kent-sussex-courier-nigel-marven-anneka- svenska-the-black-mambas/ Information on the rhino conservation film project on Anneka Svenska's website =Awards= Nigel Marven was nominated for BAFTA TV Awards in 2000 for Best Features.Nigel Marven's awards IMDB In 2015, he was nominated for Donald Gosling Award by Maritime Media Awards for his series Nigel Marven's Cruise Ship Adventures. In 2016, he received award from Cruise Lines International Association.Nigel Marven's Tweet on receiving award from CLIA  Personal life  Nigel Marven married Jenny Hull in September 1996, but they separated four years later. Nigel fathered Jane Braham's son, Theo, but went on to marry Gillian Impey on 1 May 2004. They also have a child. During The Wright Stuff on 14 July 2017 Nigel announced he is currently going through his second divorce. His children are one son Theo and daughter Eleonora. During a simulated dinosaur encounter in the third episode of Prehistoric Park, Marven declared himself a vegetarian. Throughout the series he applies the same term to naturally herbivorous animals. In the second episode of Untamed China series he says the team cooked vegetarian food especially for him. Nigel confirms he is a vegetarian on his official website by stating that the Peregrine falcon is his favourite animal and that he would love to be such a bird, but because he is a vegetarian eating raw pigeon would make that hard. In Panda Adventure Marven states that he is \\"usually teetotal\\" when having a celebratory drink with a team of Chinese trackers who led him to see pandas close-up in the wild. Nigel Marven has humorously \\"confirmed\\" being an immortal time entity in a response to a tweet theorizing the later due to Marven's prehistoric adventures so often leading him into deadly encounters, which he would always leave unscathed.

It is located between Ontario Place on the east and Mimico Creek to the west. The bay gives its name to Etobicoke's Humber Bay neighbourhood. History Prior to 1809 the bay was lined with a sandy shore with forest behind it. The area remained natural until later in the 19th century when it became developed with boathouses and various roadhouses and hotels. In 1802 a ferry service to cross Humber River was established by Richard Wilson.http://www.etobicokehistorical.com/humber-bay.html In 1882 ferry service, Humber River Ferry Company Limited was started from the Humber to Toronto by a consortium of hotel owners (Charles Nurse, John Duck and Octavius Hicks).http://www.etobicokehistorical.com/humber-bay.html This service ceased operations in 1886, but later and different ferry operations continued into the 1890s to Bathurst Street and York Street. The Toronto Harbour Commission reshaped the waterfront, infilling the shoreline by 100 yards from the Humber River east to Wilson Park Avenue. This would result in the extension of Lake Shore Boulevard to the area and ending the need for ferry service as cars were able to bring hotel visitors from Toronto.http://www.etobicokehistorical.com/humber-bay.html In the 1970s, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority built Humber Bay Park at the foot of Park Lawn Avenue. The only remaining natural shoreline is that east of Wilson Park Avenue, showing a small bluff to the lake side. Humber Bay postal village Condominium towers on Humber Bay The western riverbank of the Humber where it meets Lake Ontario was the site of an informal settlement of homes within the then Etobicoke Township. This neighbourhood was eventually cleared for the building of the Queen Elizabeth Way highway, the railway and other projects. Along Lake Shore Boulevard West in the same vicinity, the area was settled, then cleared for motels, and now cleared for condominium towers. The area is still informally known as Humber Bay. Half Moon Bay Half Moon Bay is the crescent shaped area between Humber Bay, the Western Channel entering Toronto Harbour (from Fort Rouill√© to Strachan Avenue). The area was a site of the landing of American troops during the Battle of York on April 27, 1813. Today Half Moon Bay is partially covered by infill along Lake Shore Boulevard and by Ontario Place.

Ludwig Weber was born in Vienna in 1899. He initially planned to pursue a career as a teacher and artist when he discovered his vocal promise and decided to pursue an opera career. In 1919 he began studies with Alfred Borrotau, a well- respected teacher, and had his professional debut in 1920 at the Vienna Volksoper where he sang for a few years in smaller roles. Possessing one of the largest dark-and-cavernous-type bass voices of the twentieth century, Weber was in equally high demand for villainous roles and noble characters.Liner notes, CD \\"Ludwig Weber, arias and scenes\\" (Myto 992.H029) He was a prominent exponent of the vocal technique known as \\"Bayreuth bark\\". In the mid-1920s Weber was singing in mid-size to leading roles with smaller companies throughout Germany. After a successful appearance at the Munich Wagner Festival of 1931 he joined the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1933 and soon began to receive invitations to sing abroad. In 1936 he joined the Royal Opera at Covent Garden where he sang numerous roles for several years including: Pogner, Gurnemanz, Hunding, Hagen, Daland, King Marke, Osmin, Rocco, and Commendatore. In 1945 he became a member of the Vienna State Opera, where he sang a wide repertoire for the next two decades. He became particularly associated with the roles of Richard Wagner. The title role in Boris Godunov was one of Weber's favorites, and excerpts (sung in German) survive from a performance broadcast on radio. He sang the role in multiple houses including Covent Garden in 1950. He became a regular performer at the Bayreuth Festival from 1951 to 1962, and he also appeared a number of times at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. Weber retired from the stage in 1965, by which time he had already started to teach at the Mozarteum in Salzburg (1961).

He is perhaps best known for dealing with the elusive concepts of memory and perception through light installations. After measuring with a colorimeter the light that exist naturally in a specific place and time, Finch's re-constructs the luminosity of the location through artificial means. For example, Moonlight (Luna County, New Mexico, July 13, 2003), replicates the exact light of the full moon that shone over the desert of Luna County, New Mexico on the evening of July 13, 2003. Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways to Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation for the High Line Park. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, as a series of 700 purple and grey colored glass panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name. Creative Time worked with the artist to realize the site-specific concept that emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall. Finch was chosen to create the only work of art commissioned for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

The band recorded it for their 1970 album Workingman's Dead. Written by guitarist Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter, \\"Uncle John's Band\\" presents the Dead in an acoustic and musically concise mode, with close harmony singing. The song is one of the band's best known, and is included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2001 it was named 321st (of 365) in the Songs of the Century project list. Music and lyrics \\"Uncle John's Band\\" has one of the Dead's most immediately accessible and memorable melodies, set against a bluegrass-inspired folk arrangement with acoustic guitars. Specific lyrics (\\"It's a buck dancer's choice my friend; better take my advice\\", \\"the fire from the ice\\", \\"don't tread on me\\", \\"It's the same story the crow told me\\") allude to various folk, mountain, or bluegrass tunes known to be in band members' repertoire. Single and album history Warner Bros. Records released \\"Uncle John's Band,\\" backed with \\"New Speedway Boogie,\\" as a single in 1970, receiving only limited airplay due to its length. Garcia worked with Warners to cut it down, though he later called the mix \\"an atrocity.\\"Woodward, Jake; et al. Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip, Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 120. \\"I gave them instructions on how to properly edit it and they garbled it so completely,\\" Garcia commented. The original album version ended up getting more air play than the revised Warner Bros. version.Jackson, Blair. Garcia: An American Life, Penguin Books, 1999, p.190. While the single was the group's first chart hit (peaking at No. 69 on the Billboard Hot 100), it had a greater impact than its chart performance indicates, receiving airplay on progressive rock radio stations and others with looser playlists. At a time when the Grateful Dead were already an underground legend, \\"Uncle John's Band\\" (and to some degree its albummate \\"Casey Jones\\") was the first time many in the general rock audience actually heard the band's music.Jackson, p. 188. Moreover, the song affected the mainstream because of first using the word \\"goddamn\\" in the unedited single, which many radio stations played instead of the edited version; together with the reference to cocaine in \\"Casey Jones,\\" the two songs made the band a \\"thorn in the side of Nixon that became a badge of honor to the masses.\\"Jackson, p. 190.

He was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia. He finished his undergraduate studies in comparative Indo-European linguistics at the University of Ljubljana in 1958, and completed his Ph.D. in Germanic Linguistics at the same institution in 1965. He continued with post-doctoral studies at the University of Copenhagen (1959‚Äì1961), University of Zagreb (1962‚Äì1963), University of Reykjavik (1965‚Äì1966) and Harvard University (1969‚Äì1970). Ore≈°nik is an internationally recognized specialist in comparative linguistics. He served as chair of the Department of Comparative and General Linguistics at the University of Ljubljana from 1990 to 2004. He is a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. Until 1990 Ore≈°nik focused on Germanic comparative linguistics and on Scandinavian languages, especially Icelandic. He formulated and partly substantiated some phonological rules of Icelandic. He described several non- standard phenomena of Icelandic phonology, especially within the preterit subjunctive and the imperative. His main publication from this period is Studies in the Phonology and Morphology of Icelandic (1985). The volume won the Slovenian Boris Kidriƒç Foundation Award in 1987. Since 1985 Ore≈°nik, together with a team of younger colleagues, has been developing a theory of strong and weak variants in syntax within Natural Linguistics; that is, synonymous syntactic units that compete with one another in the history of the language. The team has formulated hypotheses about the direction of this competition and has checked the hypotheses in language material. The group organized two international conferences on Natural Linguistics (including the theory of strong and weak variants) at the University of Maribor, Slovenia, in 1993 and 1996. This theory is sometimes called the Slovenian model of Natural Syntax in international circles. After 1999, Ore≈°nik abandoned the notion of strong and weak variants, calling them (morpho)syntactic variants instead. He has published two volumes on this framework: A predictable aspect of (morpho)syntactic variants (2001), and Naturalness in (morpho)syntax: English examples (2004). Janez Ore≈°nik received the Golden Order of Merit (zlati red za zasluge) of the Republic of Slovenia in 2004 and the highest Slovenian academic recognition, the Zois Award for lifetime achievements, on November 21, 2007.

The floater part comes from the fact that as they are made of a thin layer of hardened plastic filled with air: their light weight makes them susceptible to floating or swerving with the wind. Penny floaters are commonly used by young children; however, among older children they are an object of ridicule and mocked as cheap toy footballs unsuitable for use. Nonetheless, their cheapness and the fact that they do not damage other objects in urban environments as easily as regular footballs do make them common. Professional footballs are sometimes compared to penny floaters disparagingly, as in the case of the Adidas Jabulani football used in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Jabulani was criticised for its performance, which was partly because its internal stitching made it too spherical to spin normally and more like a penny floater in that regard.

Davis earned his Medical Degree from The University of Kansas. Davis was born in 1926, in Joplin, Missouri and died on 6 October 2015 in Leawood, Kansas, at 89 years of age. Initially, Davis named his sauce \\"KC Soul Style Barbecue Sauce\\", and the original formula consisted of only five ingredients. He later renamed it \\"KC Masterpiece\\". He presented his sauce to several Kansas City area food brokers, with the intention of marketing it to the public, through retail supermarket distribution. During this same time, he also presented Muschup (a combination of ketchup and mustard) and Dilled Muschup (a combination of ketchup, mustard, and dill relish). Most of the area brokerages were reluctant to give the upstart sauces a chance. Eventually, Davis met with Jim Flynn, of Flynn Brokerage. Flynn sampled the sauces, and immediately saw the barbeque sauce‚Äôs potential to introduce an innovative product, to an underserved sector of the retail market. Flynn began a ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù marketing strategy, targeting local supermarkets with food sample demonstrations. The barbeque sauce sold more than 3,000 cases (36,000 bottles) the first weekend, and the stores actually ran out of inventory. The two Muschup varieties were also demonstrated but did not fare as well. In the following months and years, KC Masterpiece sales grew exponentially. In 1986, after ten years of success in the Kansas City area, Davis received an offer to sell the KC Masterpiece brand to the Kingsford charcoal division of The HV Food Products Company (formally known as Hidden Valley Ranch Food Products, Inc.), which operates as a subsidiary of The Clorox Company, with an eye to marketing the sauce nationwide. In the agreement, Davis retained the right to use the sauce in restaurants that he was developing.

It is in a field to the West of the M5 motorway, near Bridgwater in Somerset, South West England, near to the Bristol to Exeter railway line and south of junction 23 of the motorway. It stands , with a arm span, and is made of black maul willow withies woven over a 3-tonne steel frame. Willow Man was commissioned by South West Arts, for the Year of the Artist, and was unveiled in September 2000. It marks the millennium and celebrates the role of willow in the ecology and craft tradition of the Somerset Levels. The first sculpture was burnt down in an arson attack on 8 May 2001. The sculpture was rebuilt by the same artist in October 2001, and a circular moat was excavated around it as a precaution against further attacks. A notable landmark, it can be described as a somehow permanent Wicker man sculpture. The sculpture is popularly known as Withy Man, or Angel of the South in reference to Antony Gormley's sculpture Angel of the North. The name Angel of the South is now commonly used also as the unofficial title for a proposed colossal sculpture in Ebbsfleet. In September 2006 Willow Man received \\"a ¬£20,000 hair cut\\". The sculptor Serena de la Hey said that she thought many local birds had been using the material for their nests. When the artist saw her sculpture she was \\"shocked to see the wear and tear\\".

History  Location of the Conowingo Bridge, 1900 The original Conowingo Bridge was a seven-span, , covered bridge built between 1818 and 1820 by Louis Wernwag, who also worked on the Rock Run Bridge. (Another source lists 1844.) That bridge was destroyed, in 1846 or 1847, by a flood. A new wooden covered bridge opened in 1859. Civil War defense plan for the bridge This crossing was an important link between Maryland and northern states in the 19th century. During the American Civil War it was guarded on its southern approach and some of the bridge decking removed to prevent surreptitious crossing. On June 6, 1907, \\"firebugs\\" set fire to the 1859 bridge using kerosene. About three-quarters of a mile of it burned. The bridge was rebuilt as a steel structure in 1909. In 1911 the state of Maryland bought the bridge and ended the tolls. With the completion of the dam in 1928 both the town and the crossing were relocated due to the rising waters impounded by the dam. The road crossing moved to the top of the dam.

It has a growing commuter community that works in Zalaegerszeg, the county seat and regional industrial center that is located about to the North. Location, Geography Bocf√∂lde is settled on the left bank of the V√°licka a small river originating in the Southwest of Zala County and merging into the Zala River. Zalaegerszeg is to the North, village of Csat√°r (1 km) is to the East, and S√°rhida (2 km) is to the South. Roads crossing the hills of Bocf√∂lde to the valley on the West could be safely ridden only by four-wheel drive vehicles. Older houses were built on the Zala Hills overlooking the V√°licka Valley, whereas from the 1960s a new settlement developed in the Valley itself. Here, European route E65, a local road connecting to Zalaegerszeg-S√°rhida-Bak, and the Zalaegerszeg-R√©dics railway provide convenient access to the rest of the region. Bocf√∂lde is part of G√∂csej, a geographic, historical, architectural, and ethnographic unit, that maintained elements of a unique agricultural culture until the 1950s and 1960s, when industrialization and modernization accelerated. G√∂cseji Falum√∫zeum, a reconstructed model village displaying original houses, agricultural buildings collected from the G√∂csej region is nearby in Zalaegerszeg.  History Its first recorded name, in 1247, is \\"Possessio Buchfelden\\". Its stone church, mentioned in a 1426 document, was dedicated to Saint Margaret of Hungary. The church and the entire village were destroyed in the 17th Century. Its decline started after the Ottoman army won a major battle against the Hungarians at Moh√°cs in 1526. As the Ottoman troops used the Kanizsa-Sopron-Vienna road, which crossed the village, for several military campaigns, Bocf√∂lde settlement was deserted. The village became completely exposed in 1571 when the Ottoman troops occupied the nearby defensive fort of Kanizsa, now Nagykanizsa. The village was resettled, away from the Kanizsa-Sopron road, in the relative protection of surrounding forested hills, after the end of Ottoman occupation in the late 17th century. By 1826 its population, made up by families of small land owners, grew to 413 residents of 56 households.

It constitutes . The parashah tells how Moses asked to see the Land of Israel, made arguments to obey the law, recounted setting up the Cities of Refuge, recited the Ten Commandments and the Shema, and gave instructions for the Israelites' conquest of the Land. The parashah is made up of 7,343 Hebrew letters, 1,878 Hebrew words, 122 verses, and 249 lines in a Torah Scroll (, Sefer Torah). Jews in the Diaspora generally read it in late July or August. It is always read on the special Sabbath Shabbat Nachamu, the Sabbath immediately after Tisha B'Av. As the parashah describes how the Israelites would sin and be banished from the Land of Israel, Jews also read part of the parashah as the Torah reading for the morning (, Shacharit) prayer service on Tisha B'Av, which commemorates the destruction of both the First Temple and Second Temple in Jerusalem. Readings In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , aliyot. In the masoretic text of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Parashah Va'etchanan has six \\"open portion\\" (, petuchah) divisions (roughly equivalent to paragraphs, often abbreviated with the Hebrew letter (peh)). Parashah Va'etchanan has several further subdivisions, called \\"closed portions\\" (, setumah) (abbreviated with the Hebrew letter (samekh)) within the open portion (, petuchah) divisions. The first open portion (, petuchah) divides the first reading (, aliyot). The second open portion (, petuchah) goes from the middle of the first reading (, aliyah) to the middle of the second reading (, aliyah). The third open portion (, petuchah) concludes the second reading (, aliyah). The fourth open portion (, petuchah) corresponds to the third reading. The fifth open portion (, petuchah) spans the fourth and fifth readings (, aliyot). And the sixth open portion (, petuchah) spans the sixth and seventh readings (, aliyot). Several closed portion (, setumah) divisions, notably one for every commandment, further divide the fourth and sixth readings (, aliyot).See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Devarim/Deuteronomy.

Moses Views the Land of Israel (woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld from the 1860 Bible in Pictures) =First reading ‚Äî Deuteronomy 3:23‚Äì4:4= In the first reading (, aliyah), Moses pleaded with God to let him cross over and see the other side of the Jordan River. But God was wrathful with Moses and would not listen, telling Moses never to speak of the matter again, and Moses blamed his punishment on the Israelites. God directed Moses to climb the summit of Pisgah and look at the land. And God told Moses to give Joshua his instructions and imbue him with strength and courage, for Joshua was to lead the people and allot to them the land. The first open portion (, petuchah) ends here with the end of the chapter.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Devarim/Deuteronomy. Edited by Menachem Davis, page 27. Moses Receiving the Tablets of the Law (painting by Jo√£o Zeferino da Costa) Moses exhorted the Israelites to heed God's laws, not to add anything to them, and not to take anything away from them, so that they might live to enter and occupy the land that God was giving them. Moses noted that in the sin of Baal-peor, God wiped out every person who followed Baal-peor, while preserving alive those who held fast to God. The first reading (, aliyah) ends here.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Devarim/Deuteronomy. Edited by Menachem Davis, page 28. =Second reading ‚Äî Deuteronomy 4:5‚Äì40= In the second reading (, aliyah), Moses argued that observing the laws faithfully would prove to other peoples the Israelites' wisdom and discernment, for no other great nation had a god so close at hand as God, and no other great nation had laws as perfect as God's. Moses urged the Israelites to take utmost care not to forget the things that they saw, and to make them known to their children and children's children: How they stood before God at Horeb, the mountain was ablaze with flames, God spoke to them out of the fire, and God declared to them the Ten Commandments. At the same time, God commanded Moses to impart to the Israelites laws for them to observe in the land that they were about to occupy. Moses Promulgates the Law (illustration from the 1728 Figures de la Bible) Because the Israelites saw no shape when God spoke to them out of the fire at Horeb, Moses warned them not to make for themselves a sculptured image in any likeness whatever ‚Äî the form of a man, woman, beast, bird, creeping thing, or fish. And when they looked up and saw the sun, moon, stars, and heaven, they were not to be lured into bowing down to them or serving them, for God allotted those things to other peoples, but God took the Israelites and brought them out of Egypt to be God's very own people. Moses said that God was angry with him on account of the Israelites, and God swore that Moses would not enter the land but would die in the land east of the Jordan. Moses cautioned the Israelites not to forget the covenant that God concluded with them, and not to make a sculptured image, for God is a consuming fire, an impassioned God. The second open portion (, petuchah) ends here.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Devarim/Deuteronomy. Edited by Menachem Davis, page 33. Moses called heaven and earth to witness against the Israelites that should they make for themselves a sculptured image when they were in the land, then God would scatter them among the peoples, leaving only a scant few alive. There in exile they would serve man-made gods of wood and stone, that would not be able to see, hear, eat, or smell. But when they were in distress and they searched for God with all their heart and soul, returned to God, and obeyed God, then they would find God, even there. For God is a compassionate God, Who would not fail them, let them perish, or forget the covenant that He made on oath with their fathers. Moses invited the Israelites to consider whether any people had ever heard the voice of a god speaking out of a fire and survived, or any god had taken one nation from the midst of another by prodigious acts and awesome power as their God had done for them in Egypt before their very eyes. Moses said that it had been clearly demonstrated to them that the Lord alone is God and that there is none beside Him. Moses thus admonished them to observe God's laws and commandments, which Moses enjoined upon them that day, that it might go well with them and their children, and that they might long remain in the land that God was assigning to them for all time.

Edited by Menachem Davis, page 37. =Third reading ‚Äî Deuteronomy 4:41‚Äì49= In the third reading (, aliyah), Moses set aside three cities of refuge on the east side of the Jordan to which a manslayer who unwittingly slew a person without having been hostile to him in the past could escape and live: Bezer among the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead among the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan among the Manassites.

Many Jewish Bibles in both Hebrew and English (including the 1917 Jewish Publication Society Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text, the New Jewish Publication Society Tanakh, and the ArtScroll Chumash) use the numbering of the Upper Trope Marks system as used for public readings. Parallel verse numbering thus appears for the Ten Commandments in and here in Moses summoned the Israelites and called on them to hear the laws that he proclaimed that day, to study and observe them faithfully. At Horeb, God made a covenant with them ‚Äî not with their fathers, but with them, the living, every one of them. God spoke to them face to face out of the fire on the mountain. Moses stood between God and them to convey God's words to them, for they were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.

And these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when thou rise up.

Edited by Menachem Davis, page 47. Moses exhorted the Israelites, when God brought them into the land and they ate their fill, not to forget the God who freed them from bondage in Egypt, to revere and worship only God, and to swear only by God's name. Moses warned the Israelites not to follow other gods, lest the anger of God wipe them off the face of the earth. A closed portion (, setumah) ends here.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Devarim/Deuteronomy. Edited by Menachem Davis, page 48. Moses warned the Israelites not to try God, as they did at Massah, but to keep God's commandments and do what is right in God's sight, that it might go well with them, that they might be able to possess the land, and that all their enemies might be driven out before them. A closed portion (, setumah) ends here.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Devarim/Deuteronomy. Edited by Menachem Davis, page 49. And when their children would ask the meaning of the commandments, they were to answer that they were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and God produced marvelous and destructive signs and portents, freed them with a mighty hand to give them the land, and then commanded them to observe all these laws for their lasting good and survival.

Edited by Menachem Davis, page 50. =Seventh reading ‚Äî Deuteronomy 7:1‚Äì11= In the seventh reading (, aliyah), Moses told the Israelites that when God brought them to the land and dislodged seven nations before them ‚Äî the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites ‚Äî the Israelites were to doom them to destruction, grant them no terms, and give them no quarter. The Israelites were not to intermarry with them, for they would turn the Israelites' children away from God to worship other gods, and God's anger would wipe the Israelites out. The Israelites were to tear down the nations' altars, smash their pillars, cut down their sacred posts, and consign their images to the fire. The Israelites were a people consecrated to God, and God chose them from all the peoples on earth to be God's treasured people. God chose them not because they were the most numerous of peoples, but because God favored them and kept the oath God made with their fathers. Moses told them to note that only God is God, the steadfast God who keeps God's covenant faithfully to the thousandth generation of those who love God and keep God's commandments, but who instantly requites with destruction those who reject God. The maftir () reading concludes the parashah with and concludes the sixth open portion (, petuchah).See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Devarim/Deuteronomy.

Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1944; reprinted 2018. reports that on the seventh day of Creation, God finished God‚Äôs work, rested, and blessed and hallowed the seventh day. The Sabbath is one of the Ten Commandments. Exodus 20:8‚Äì11 in the NJPS. commands that one remember the Sabbath day, keep it holy, and not do any manner of work or cause anyone under one‚Äôs control to work, for in six days God made heaven and earth and rested on the seventh day, blessed the Sabbath, and hallowed it. commands that one observe the Sabbath day, keep it holy, and not do any manner of work or cause anyone under one‚Äôs control to work ‚Äî so that one‚Äôs subordinates might also rest ‚Äî and remember that the Israelites were servants in the land of Egypt, and God brought them out with a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. In the incident of the manna (, man) in Moses told the Israelites that the Sabbath is a solemn rest day; prior to the Sabbath one should cook what one would cook, and lay up food for the Sabbath. And God told Moses to let no one go out of one‚Äôs place on the seventh day. In just before giving Moses the second Tablets of Stone, God commanded that the Israelites keep and observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a sign between God and the children of Israel forever, for in six days God made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day God rested. In just before issuing the instructions for the Tabernacle, Moses again told the Israelites that no one should work on the Sabbath, specifying that one must not kindle fire on the Sabbath. In God told Moses to repeat the Sabbath commandment to the people, calling the Sabbath a holy convocation. The prophet Isaiah taught in that iniquity is inconsistent with the Sabbath. In the prophet taught that if people turn away from pursuing or speaking of business on the Sabbath and call the Sabbath a delight, then God will make themride upon the high places of the earth and will feed them with the heritage of Jacob. And in the prophet taught that in times to come, from one Sabbath to another, all people will come to worship God. The prophet Jeremiah taught in that the fate of Jerusalem depended on whether the people obstained from work on the Sabbath, refraining from carrying burdens outside their houses and through the city gates. The prophet Ezekiel told in how God gave the Israelites God‚Äôs Sabbaths, to be a sign between God and them, but the Israelites rebelled against God by profaning the Sabbaths, provoking God to pour out God‚Äôs fury upon them, but God stayed God‚Äôs hand. In Nehemiah told how he saw some treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and others bringing all manner of burdens into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, so when it began to be dark before the Sabbath, he commanded that the city gates be shut and not opened till after the Sabbath and directed the Levites to keep the gates to sanctify the Sabbath.

Both and speak of binding the commandments to one's person ‚Äî to hand and forehead, to heart and throat. In Moses cautioned the Israelites not test God. Similarly, in the prophet Malachi criticized the people of his time who tempted God. =Deuteronomy chapter 7= Professor Benjamin Sommer of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America read and to teach that God punishes children for their parents‚Äô sins as a sign of mercy to the parents: When sinning parents repent, God defers their punishment to their offspring. Sommer argued that other Biblical writers, engaging in inner-Biblical interpretation, rejected that notion in and Sommer argued that for example, quoted which was already an authoritative and holy text, but revised the morally troubling part: Where taught that God punishes sin for generations, maintained that God does not contend forever. Sommer argued that and similarly quoted with revision. Sommer asserted that and do not try to tell us how to read that is, they do not argue that somehow means something other than what it seems to say. Rather, they repeat while also disagreeing with part of it.Benjamin D. Sommer. \\"Inner-biblical Interpretation.\\" In The Jewish Study Bible. Edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, page 1833.

Thus Rav Huna taught that as soon as God told Moses to hand over his office to Joshua, Moses immediately began to pray to be permitted to enter the Promised land. The Midrash compared Moses to a governor who could be sure that the king would confirm whatever orders he gave so long as he retained his office. The governor redeemed whomever he desired and imprisoned whomever he desired. But as soon as the governor retired and another was appointed in his place, the gatekeeper would not let him enter the king's palace. Similarly, as long as Moses remained in office, he imprisoned whomever he desired and released whomever he desired, but when he was relieved of his office and Joshua was appointed in his stead, and he asked to be permitted to enter the Promised Land, God in denied his request.Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:5. Land of Israel, 9th century. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 33. London: Soncino Press, 1939. The Gemara deduced from Moses's example in that one should seek a suppliant frame of mind before praying. Rav Huna and Rav Hisda were discussing how long to wait between recitations of the Amidah if one erred in the first reciting and needed to repeat the prayer. One said: long enough for the person praying to fall into a suppliant frame of mind, citing the words \\"And I supplicated the Lord\\" in The other said: long enough to fall into an interceding frame of mind, citing the words \\"And Moses interceded\\" in Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 30b. Babylonia, 6th century. In, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Gedaliah Zlotowitz; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 1, page 30b2. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997. Rabbi Simlai deduced from that one should always first praise God at the beginning of prayer, for Moses praised God in before he asked God in to let him see the good land.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 32a, Avodah Zarah 7b‚Äì8a. Rabbi Eleazar deduced from that God let Moses see the Promised Land only because Moses prayed, and thus Rabbi Eleazar concluded that prayer is more effective than good deeds, for no one was greater in good deeds than Moses, and yet God let Moses see the land only after Moses prayed.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 32b. The Temple in Jerusalem, with the altar at right Rabban Johanan ben Zakai interpreted the word \\"Lebanon\\" in to refer to the Temple in Jerusalem and \\"that goodly mountain\\" to refer to the Temple Mount. Thus one can interpret to say that Moses asked to see God's House.Babylonian Talmud Gittin 56b. Similarly, a Midrash interpreted the word \\"Lebanon\\" in to refer to the altar. Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai explained that the altar was called \\"Lebanon\\" because it made white (malbin) the sins of Israel, as indicated by the words of \\"though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white (yalbinu) as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\\" Rabbi Tabyomi said that the altar was called \\"Lebanon\\" because all hearts (lebabot) rejoice there, as indicated by the words of \\"Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth, even Mount Zion.\\" And the Rabbis said that the altar was called \\"Lebanon\\" because of the words of 1 Kings which says of God and the Temple: \\"My eyes and My heart (libbi) shall be there perpetually.Leviticus Rabbah 1:2. Land of Israel, 5th century. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 4, page 4. London: Soncino Press, 1939. Another Midrash employed the understanding of \\"Lebanon\\" as the Temple to explain the role of gold in the world. Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish taught that the world did not deserve to have the use of gold. But God created gold for the sake of the Temple. The Midrash deduced this from the use of the word \\"good\\" in both where it says, \\"the gold of that land is good,\\" and where it says, \\"that goodly hill-country, and Lebanon.\\"Genesis Rabbah 16:2. Land of Israel, 5th century. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, page 125. London: Soncino Press, 1939. Destruction of Korah Dathan and Abiram (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible) Rabbi Levi taught that God told Moses \\"enough!\\" in to repay Moses measure for measure for when Moses told Korah \\"enough!\\" in The Gemara provided another explanation of the word \\"enough! (, rav)\\" in God was telling Moses that Moses had a master (, rav), namely Joshua, waiting to assume authority to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land, and thus Moses should not delay another master's reign by prolonging his own. The Gemara provided a third explanation of the word \\"enough!\\": God was telling Moses not to petition him anymore, so that people should not say: \\"How severe is the Master, and how persistent is the student.\\" The Gemara explained why God was so hard on Moses with a Baraita taught in the School of Rabbi Ishmael: according to the camel is the burden; that is, a stronger, more righteous one must bear a greater burden.Babylonian Talmud Sotah 13b. The School of Rabbi Ishmael taught that whenever Scripture uses the word \\"command\\" (, tzav) (as does), it denotes exhortation to obedience immediately and for all time. A Baraita deduced exhortation to immediate obedience from the use of the word \\"command\\" in which says, \\"charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him.\\" And the Baraita deduced exhortation to obedience for all time from the use of the word \\"command\\" in which says, \\"even all that the Lord has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord gave the commandment, and onward throughout your generations.\\"Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 29a. \\"You shall make them known to your children, and your children's children\\" (illustration from a Bible card published 1901 by the Providence Lithograph Company) =Deuteronomy chapter 4= In Moses calls on Israel to heed the \\"statutes\\" (hukim) and \\"ordinances\\" (mishpatim). The Rabbis in a Baraita taught that the \\"ordinances\\" (mishpatim) were commandments that logic would have dictated that we follow even had Scripture not commanded them, like the laws concerning idolatry, adultery, bloodshed, robbery, and blasphemy. And \\"statutes\\" (hukim) were commandments that the Adversary challenges us to violate as beyond reason, like those relating to shaatnez (in and ), halizah (in ), purification of the person with tzaraat (in ), and the scapegoat (in ). So that people do not think these \\"ordinances\\" (mishpatim) to be empty acts, which speaks of the \\"statutes\\" (hukim) and \\"ordinances\\" (mishpatim), says \\"I am the Lord,\\" indicating that the Lord made these statutes, and we have no right to question them.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 67b. The Gemara cited as an instance of where the Torah alludes to life after death. The Gemara related that sectarians asked Rabban Gamaliel where Scripture says that God will resurrect the dead. Rabban Gamaliel answered them from the Torah, the Prophets (, Nevi'im), and the Writings (, Ketuvim), yet the sectarians did not accept his proofs. From the Torah, Rabban Gamaliel cited \\"And the Lord said to Moses, ‚ÄòBehold, you shall sleep with your fathers and rise up [again].'\\" But the sectarians replied that perhaps reads, \\"and the people will rise up.\\" From the Prophets, Rabban Gamaliel cited \\"Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out its dead.\\" But the sectarians rejoined that perhaps refers to the dead whom Ezekiel resurrected in From the Writings, Rabban Gamaliel cited Song of Songs \\"And the roof of your mouth, like the best wine of my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips of those who are asleep to speak.\\" (As the Rabbis interpreted Song of Songs as a dialogue between God and Israel, they understood to refer to the dead, whom God will cause to speak again.) But the sectarians rejoined that perhaps means merely that the lips of the departed will move. For Rabbi Johanan said that if a halachah (legal ruling) is said in any person's name in this world, the person's lips speak in the grave, as says, \\"causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.\\" Thus Rabban Gamaliel did not satisfy the sectarians until he quoted \\"which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them.\\" Rabban Gamaliel noted that God swore to give the land not \\"to you\\" (the Israelites whom Moses addressed) but \\"to them\\" (the Patriarchs, who had long since died). Others say that Rabban Gamaliel proved it from \\"But you who did cleave to the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.\\" And (the superfluous use of \\"this day\\" implies that) just as you are all alive today, so shall you all live again in the World To Come.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 90b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Asher Dicker, Joseph Elias, and Dovid Katz; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 49, pages 90b2‚Äì4. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1995. A Midrash taught that and call the Euphrates \\"the Great River\\" because it encompasses the Land of Israel. The Midrash noted that at the creation of the world, the Euphrates was not designated \\"great.\\" But it is called \\"great\\" because it encompasses the Land of Israel, which calls a \\"great nation.\\" As a popular saying said, the king's servant is a king, and thus Scripture calls the Euphrates great because of its association with the great nation of Israel.Genesis Rabbah 16:3, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, pages 126‚Äì27. Bar Kappara interpreted \\"Only take heed to yourself,\\" together with \\"For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment that I command you.\\" Bar Kappara compared the soul and the Torah to a lamp, as says, \\"The soul of man is the lamp of the Lord,\\" and says, \\"For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light.\\" God told humanity that God's light ‚Äî the Torah ‚Äî is in their hands, and their light ‚Äî their souls ‚Äî are in God's hands. God said that if people guard God's light, then God will guard their lights, but if people extinguish God's light, then God will extinguish their lights. For says, \\"Only take heed to yourself,\\" and then \\"Keep your soul diligently.\\" This explains \\"For if you shall diligently keep.\\" The Midrash thus taught that \\"if you keep\\" (God's commandments), then \\"you shall be kept\\" (and your souls shall be guarded).Deuteronomy Rabbah 4:4. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 91. See also Babylonian Talmud Sotah 21a. In, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Sota. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 20. Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2015. (the commandment is a lamp and Torah is light). A Baraita deduced from the words \\"you shall make them known to your children, and your children's children\\" in that if a parent teaches a child Torah, Scripture ascribes merit as though the parent had taught the child, the child's children, and so on, until the end of all time.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30a. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that if a parent teaches a child (or some say a grandchild) Torah, Scripture accounts it as if the parent had received the Torah at Mount Sinai, as says, \\"And you shall make them known to your children and your children's children,\\" and immediately thereafter, says, \\"The day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb.\\"Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 21b (child). Kiddushin 30a (grandchild). Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba once found Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, who had hurriedly thrown a cloth upon his head, taking his child (or some say grandchild) to the synagogue to study. When Rabbi Hiyya asked Rabbi Joshua what was going on, Rabbi Joshua replied that it was no small thing that the words \\"you shall make them known to your children and your children's children\\" are immediately followed by the words \\"The day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb.\\" From then on, Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba did not eat breakfast before revising the previous day's lesson with his child (or some say grandchild) and adding another verse. And Rabbah son of Rav Huna did not eat breakfast until he took his child (or some say grandchild) to school.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30a. A Baraita deduced from the proximity of the words \\"And you shall make them known to your children and your children's children\\" in to the words \\"The day on which you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb\\" in that just as at Mount Sinai, the Israelites stood in dread, fear, trembling, and quaking, so when one teaches Torah to one's child, one should do so in dread, fear, trembling, and quaking.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 22a. The Rabbis related Jacob's dream in to Sinai. The \\"ladder\\" symbolizes Mount Sinai. That the ladder is \\"set upon (, mutzav) the earth\\" recalls which says, \\"And they stood (, vayityatzvu) at the nether part of the mount.\\" The words of \\"and the top of it reached to heaven,\\" echo those of \\"And the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven.\\" \\"And behold the angels of God\\" alludes to Moses and Aaron. \\"Ascending\\" parallels \\"And Moses went up to God.\\" \\"And descending\\" parallels \\"And Moses went down from the mount.\\" And the words \\"and, behold, the Lord stood beside him\\" in parallel the words of \\"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai.\\"Genesis Rabbah 68:12. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 625. Rabbi Johanan counted ten instances in which Scripture refers to the death of Moses (including one in the parashah), teaching that God did not finally seal the harsh decree until God declared it to Moses. Rabbi Johanan cited these ten references to the death of Moses: (1) \\"But I must die in this land; I shall not cross the Jordan\\"; (2) \\"The Lord said to Moses: ‚ÄòBehold, your days approach that you must die'\\"; (3) \\"[E]ven now, while I am still alive in your midst, you have been defiant toward the Lord; and how much more after my death\\"; (4) \\"For I know that after my death, you will act wickedly and turn away from the path that I enjoined upon you\\"; (5) \\"And die in the mount that you are about to ascend, and shall be gathered to your kin, as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his kin\\"; (6) \\"This is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, bade the Israelites farewell before his death\\"; (7) \\"So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, at the command of the Lord\\"; (8) \\"Moses was 120 years old when he died\\"; (9) \\"Now it came to pass after the death of Moses\\"; and (10) \\"Moses My servant is dead.\\" Rabbi Johanan taught that ten times it was decreed that Moses should not enter the Land of Israel, but the harsh decree was not finally sealed until God revealed it to him and declared (as reported in ): \\"It is My decree that you should not pass over.\\"Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:10. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 180. Rabbi Jonah taught not to investigate what was before (illustration from Camille Flammarion's 1888 L'atmosph√®re: m√©t√©orologie populaire) the Hebrew letter bet Rabbi Jonah taught in the name of Rabbi Levi that the world was created with a letter bet (the first letter in which begins, , Bereishit bara Elohim, \\"In the beginning God created\\") because just as the letter bet is closed at the sides but open in front, so one is not permitted to investigate what is above and what is below, what is before and what is behind. Similarly, Bar Kappara reinterpreted the words of to say, \\"ask not of the days past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth,\\" teaching that one may speculate from the day that days were created, but one should not speculate on what was before that. And one may investigate from one end of heaven to the other, but one should not investigate what was before this world.Genesis Rabbah 1:10, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, page 9. Similarly, the Rabbis in a Baraita interpreted to forbid inquiry into the work of creation in the presence of two people, reading the words \\"for ask now of the days past\\" to indicate that one may inquire, but not two. The Rabbis reasoned that the words \\"since the day that God created man upon the earth\\" in taught that one must not inquire concerning the time before creation. The Rabbis reasoned that the words \\"the days past that were before you\\" in taught that one may inquire about the six days of creation. The Rabbis further reasoned that the words \\"from the one end of heaven to the other\\" in taught that one must not inquire about what is beyond the universe, what is above and what is below, what is before and what is after.Babylonian Talmud Chagigah 11b. Rabbi Eleazar read the words \\"since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven\\" in to read, \\"from the day that God created Adam on earth and to the end of heaven.\\" Thus Rabbi Eleazar read to intimate that when God created Adam in Adam extended from the earth to the firmament. But as soon as Adam sinned, God placed God's hand upon Adam and diminished him, as says: \\"You have fashioned me after and before, and laid Your hand upon me.\\" Similarly, Rav Judah in the name of Rav taught that when God created Adam in Adam extended from one end of the world to the other, reading to read, \\"Since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from one end of heaven to the other.\\" (And Rav Judah in the name of Rav also taught that as soon as Adam sinned, God placed God's hand upon Adam and diminished him.) The Gemara reconciled the interpretations of Rabbi Eleazar and Rav Judah in the name of Rav by concluding that the distance from the earth to the firmament must equal the distance from one end of heaven to the other.Babylonian Talmud Chagigah 12a. Rabbi Levi addressed the question that raises: \\"Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?\\" ( in turn, refers back to the encounter at Sinai reported at and after.) Rabbi Levi taught that the world would not have been able to survive hearing the voice of God in God's power, but instead, as says, \\"The voice of the Lord is with power.\\" That is, the voice of God came according to the power of each individual ‚Äî young, old, or infant ‚Äî to receive it.Exodus Rabbah 29:1. 10th century. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by S.M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 337. London: Soncino Press, 1939. The Gemara counted only three verses in the Torah that indisputably refer to God's Kingship, and thus are suitable for recitation on Rosh Hashanah: \\"The Lord his God is with him, and the shouting for the King is among them\\"; \\"And He was King in Jeshurun\\"; and \\"The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.\\" Rabbi Jose also counted as Kingship verses \\"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God the Lord is One\\"; \\"And you shall know on that day and lay it to your heart that the Lord is God, . . . there is none else\\"; and \\"To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord is God, there is none else beside Him\\"; but Rabbi Judah said that none of these three is a Kingship verse. (The traditional Rosh Hashanah liturgy follows Rabbi Jose and recites and and then concludes with )Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashanah 32b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Abba Zvi Naiman, Israel Schneider, Moshe Zev Einhorn, and Eliezer Herzka; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 18, page 32b3 and note 44. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1999. Rabbi Johanan taught that sorcerers are called , kashefim, because they seek to contradict the power of Heaven. (Some read , kashefim, as an acronym for , kachash pamalia, \\"contradicting the legion [of Heaven].\\") But the Gemara noted that says, \\"There is none else besides Him (God).\\" Rabbi Hanina interpreted to teach that even sorcerers have no power to oppose God's will. A woman once tried to take earth from under Rabbi Hanina's feet (so as to perform sorcery against him). Rabbi Hanina told her that if she could succeed in her attempts, she should go ahead, but (he was not concerned, for) says, \\"There is none else beside Him.\\" But the Gemara asked whether Rabbi Johanan had not taught that sorcerers are called , kashefim, because they (actually) contradict the power of Heaven. The Gemara answered that Rabbi Hanina was in a different category, owing to his abundant merit (and therefore Heaven protected him).Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 67b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli.

The Mishnah taught that those who killed in error went into banishment. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred in the course of a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur in the course of a downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.Mishnah Makkot 2:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 612‚Äì13. Babylonian Talmud Makkot 7a‚Äìb. in the Aleppo Codex Rabbi Jose bar Judah taught that to begin with, they sent a slayer to a city of refuge, whether the slayer killed intentionally or not. Then the court sent and brought the slayer back from the city of refuge. The Court executed whomever the court found guilty of a capital crime, and the court acquitted whomever the court found not guilty of a capital crime. The court restored to the city of refuge whomever the court found liable to banishment, as ordained, \\"And the congregation shall restore him to the city of refuge from where he had fled.\\"Mishnah Makkot 2:6, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 614. Babylonian Talmud Makkot 9b. also says, \\"The manslayer . . . shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil,\\" but the Mishnah taught that the death of a high priest who had been anointed with the holy anointing oil, the death of a high priest who had been consecrated by the many vestments, or the death of a high priest who had retired from his office each equally made possible the return of the slayer. Rabbi Judah said that the death of a priest who had been anointed for war also permitted the return of the slayer. Because of these laws, mothers of high priests would provide food and clothing for the slayers in cities of refuge so that the slayers might not pray for the high priest's death.Mishnah Makkot 2:6, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 615. Babylonian Talmud Makkot 11a. If the high priest died at the conclusion of the slayer's trial, the slayer did not go into banishment. If, however, the high priests died before the trial was concluded and another high priest was appointed in his stead and then the trial concluded, the slayer returned home after the new high priest's death.Mishnah Makkot 2:6, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 615. Babylonian Talmud Makkot 11b.

After Eliezer had dealt kindly with Isaac by securing Rebekah to be Isaac‚Äôs wife, he set Eliezer free, and God gave Eliezer his reward in this world by raising him up to become a king ‚Äî Og, king of Bashan.Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 16.

Rabbi Azariah in the name of Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon explained in a parable. A mortal king had a daughter whom he loved exceedingly. So long as his daughter was small, he would speak with her in public or in the courtyard. When she grew up and reached puberty, the king determined that it no longer befit his daughter's dignity for him to converse with her in public. So he directed that a pavilion be made for her so that he could speak with his daughter inside the pavilion. In the same way, when God saw the Israelites in Egypt, they were in the childhood of their nationhood, as says, \\"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.\\" When God saw the Israelites at Sinai, God spoke with them as says, \\"The Lord spoke with you face to face.\\" As soon as they received the Torah, became God's nation, and said (as reported in ), \\"All that the Lord has spoken will we do, and obey,\\" God observed that it was no longer in keeping with the dignity of God's children that God should converse with them in the open. So God instructed the Israelites to make a Tabernacle, and when God needed to communicate with the Israelites, God did so from the Tabernacle. And thus bears this out when it says, \\"And when Moses went into the tent of meeting that He might speak with him.\\"Numbers Rabbah 12:4. 12th century. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 5, pages 463‚Äì64. London: Soncino Press, 1939. See also Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 1:2, attributing the parable to Rabbi Judah bar Ilai. Moses on Mount Sinai (painting circa 1895‚Äì1900 by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me) The Mishnah taught that the priests recited the Ten Commandments daily.Mishnah Tamid 5:1. In, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 869. Babylonian Talmud Tamid 32b. The Gemara, however, taught that although the Sages wanted to recite the Ten Commandments along with the Shema in precincts outside of the Temple, they soon abolished their recitation, because the Sages did not want to lend credence to the arguments of the heretics (who might argue that Jews honored only the Ten Commandments).Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 12a. Rabbi Tobiah bar Isaac read the words of and \\"I am the Lord your God,\\" to teach that it was on the condition that the Israelites acknowledged God as their God that God (in the continuation of and ) \\"brought you out of the land of Egypt.\\" And a Midrash compared \\"I am the Lord your God\\" to a princess who having been taken captive by robbers, was rescued by a king, who subsequently asked her to marry him. Replying to his proposal, she asked what dowry the king would give her, to which the king replied that it was enough that he had rescued her from the robbers. (So God's delivery of the Israelites from Egypt was enough reason for the Israelites to obey God's commandments.)Exodus Rabbah 29:3. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 338. The Gemara taught that the Israelites heard the words of the first two commandments (in (20:2‚Äì3 in NJPS) and (5:7‚Äì8 in NJPS)) directly from God. Rabbi Simlai expounded that a total of 613 commandments were communicated to Moses ‚Äî 365 negative commandments, corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, and 248 positive commandments, corresponding to the number of the parts in the human body. Rav Hamnuna said that one may derive this from \\"Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.\\" The letters of the word \\"Torah\\" () have a numerical value of 611 (as equals 400, equals 6, equals 200, and equals 5). And the Gemara did not count among the commandments that the Israelites heard from Moses the commandments, \\"I am the Lord your God,\\" and, \\"You shall have no other gods before Me,\\" as the Israelites heard those commandments directly from God.Babylonian Talmud Makkot 23b‚Äì24a. Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that when God gave the Torah, no bird twittered, no fowl flew, no ox lowed, none of the Ophanim stirred a wing, the Seraphim did not say (in the words of ) \\"Holy, Holy,\\" the sea did not roar, the creatures did not speak, the whole world was hushed into breathless silence and the voice went forth in the words of and \\"I am the Lord your God.\\"Exodus Rabbah 29:9. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by S.M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 344. Rabbi Levi explained that God said the words of and \\"I am the Lord your God,\\" to reassure Israel that just because they heard many voices at Sinai, they should not believe that there are many deities in heaven, but rather they should know that God alone is God.Exodus Rabbah 29:1. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by S.M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 337. Rabbi Levi said that the section beginning at was spoken in the presence of the whole Israelite people, because it includes each of the Ten Commandments, noting that: (1) says, \\"I am the Lord your God,\\" and says, \\"I am the Lord your God\\"; (2) (20:3 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall have no other gods,\\" and says, \\"Nor make to yourselves molten gods\\"; (3) (20:7 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,\\" and says, \\"And you shall not swear by My name falsely\\"; (4) (20:8 in NJPS) says, \\"Remember the Sabbath day,\\" and says, \\"And you shall keep My Sabbaths\\"; (5) (20:12 in NJPS) says, \\"Honor your father and your mother,\\" and says, \\"You shall fear every man his mother, and his father\\"; (6) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not murder,\\" and says, \\"Neither shall you stand idly by the blood of your neighbor\\"; (7) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not commit adultery,\\" and says, \\"Both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death; (8) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not steal,\\" and says, \\"You shall not steal\\"; (9) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not bear false witness,\\" and says, \\"You shall not go up and down as a talebearer\\"; and (10) (20:14 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not covet . . . anything that is your neighbor's,\\" and says, \\"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\\"Leviticus Rabbah 24:5. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 4, pages 307‚Äì08. Idolatry (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Sweet Publishing) Rabbi Ishmael interpreted (20:2‚Äì3 in NJPS) and (5:6‚Äì7 in NJPS) to be the first of the Ten Commandments. Rabbi Ishmael taught that Scripture speaks in particular of idolatry, for says, \\"Because he has despised the word of the Lord.\\" Rabbi Ishmael interpreted this to mean that an idolater despises the first word among the Ten Words or Ten Commandments in (20:2‚Äì3 in NJPS) and (5:6‚Äì7 in NJPS), \\"I am the Lord your God . . . . You shall have no other gods before Me.\\"Sifre to Numbers 112:4:3. Land of Israel, circa 250‚Äì350 CE. In, e.g., Sifr√© to Numbers: An American Translation and Explanation.

Shabbat candles Noting that (20:8 in NJPS) says, \\"Remember the Sabbath day,\\" and (5:12 in NJPS) says, \\"Observe the Sabbath day,\\" the Gemara taught that God pronounced both \\"Remember\\" and \\"Observe\\" in a single utterance, an utterance that the mouth cannot utter, nor the ear hear.Babylonian Talmud Shevuot 20b. See also Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael 53:2, Bahodesh chapter 7. Land of Israel, late 4th century. In, e.g., Mekhilta According to Rabbi Ishmael. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 79. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1988. Rav Ada bar Ahabah taught that the Torah thus obligates women to sanctify the Sabbath (by reciting or hearing the Kiddush, even though women are generally not bound to observe such positive precepts that depend on specified times). For Scripture says both \\"Remember\\" and \\"Observe,\\" and all who are included in the exhortation \\"Observe\\" are included in the exhortation \\"Remember.\\" And women, since they are included in \\"Observe\\" (which the Rabbis interpret as a negative commandment that binds all Jews), are also included in \\"Remember.\\"Babylonian Talmud Shevuot 20b. myrtle The Gemara reports that on the eve of the Sabbath before sunset, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and his son saw an old man running with two bundles of myrtle and asked him what they were for. The old man explained that they were to bring a sweet smell to his house in honor of the Sabbath. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai asked whether one bundle would not be enough. The old man replied that one bundle was for ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù in (20:8 in NJPS) and one was for ‚ÄúObserve‚Äù in (5:12 in NJPS). Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai told his son to mark how precious the commandments are to Israel.Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 33b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Asher Dicker, Nasanel Kasnett, and David Fohrman; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr, volume 3, page 33b4. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1996. A Midrash deduced from similarities in the language of the creation of humanity and the Sabbath commandment that God gave Adam the precept of the Sabbath. Reading the report of God's creating Adam in ‚ÄúAnd He put him (, vayanihehu) into the Garden of Eden,‚Äù the Midrash taught that ‚ÄúAnd He put him (, vayanihehu)‚Äù means that God gave Adam the precept of the Sabbath, for the Sabbath commandment uses a similar word in (20:11 in the NJPS), ‚ÄúAnd rested (, vayanach) on the seventh day.‚Äù continues, ‚Äúto till it (, le‚Äôavedah),‚Äù and the Sabbath commandment uses a similar word in (20:9 in the NJPS), ‚ÄúSix days shall you labor (, ta‚Äôavod).‚Äù And continues, ‚ÄúAnd to keep it (, ule-shamerah),‚Äù and the Sabbath commandment uses a similar word in (5:12 in the NJPS), ‚ÄúKeep (, shamor) the Sabbath day.‚ÄùGenesis Rabbah 16:5, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, page 130. Rav Judah taught in Rav's name that the words of (5:12 in the NJPS), ‚ÄúObserve the Sabbath day . . . as the Lord your God commanded you‚Äù (in which Moses used the past tense for the word ‚Äúcommanded,‚Äù indicating that God had commanded the Israelites to observe the Sabbath before the revelation at Mount Sinai) indicate that God commanded the Israelites to observe the Sabbath when they were at Marah, about which reports, ‚ÄúThere He made for them a statute and an ordinance.‚ÄùBabylonian Talmud Shabbat 87b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ‚Ä¢ Part Two. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 3, page 29. Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012. The Tanna Devei Eliyahu taught that if you live by the commandment establishing the Sabbath (in (20:8 in the NJPS) and (5:12 in the NJPS)), then (in the words of ) \\"The Lord has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength: ‚ÄòSurely I will no more give your corn to be food for your enemies.\\" If, however, you transgress the commandment, then it will be as in when \\"the Lord‚Äôs anger was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying: ‚ÄòSurely none of the men . . . shall see the land.‚Äô\\"Tanna Devei Eliyahu. Seder Eliyyahu Rabbah, chapter (26) 24, page 130. 10th century. In, e.g., Tanna Debe Eliyyahu: The Lore of the School of Elijah. Translated by William G. Braude and Israel J. Kapstein, page 283. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1981. A Midrash asked to which commandment refers when it says, \\"For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment that I command you, to do it, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him, then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.\\" Rabbi Levi said that \\"this commandment\\" refers to the recitation of the Shema (), but the Rabbis said that it refers to the Sabbath, which is equal to all the precepts of the Torah.Deuteronomy Rabbah 4:4. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 91. The Alphabet of Rabbi Akiva taught that when God was giving Israel the Torah, God told them that if they accepted the Torah and observed God's commandments, then God would give them for eternity a most precious thing that God possessed ‚Äî the World To Come. When Israel asked to see in this world an example of the World To Come, God replied that the Sabbath is an example of the World To Come.Alphabet of Rabbi Akiva. Circa 700. Quoted in Abraham Joshua Heschel. The Sabbath, page 73. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1951. A Midrash cited the words of (5:14 in the NJPS), \\"And your stranger who is within your gates,\\" to show God's injunction to welcome the stranger. The Midrash compared the admonition in \\"Neither let the alien who has joined himself to the Lord speak, saying: ‚ÄòThe Lord will surely separate me from his people.‚Äô\\" (Isaiah enjoined Israelites to treat the convert the same as a native Israelite.) Similarly, the Midrash quoted in which Job said, \\"The stranger did not lodge in the street\\" (that is, none were denied hospitality), to show that God disqualifies no creature, but receives all; the city gates were open all the time and anyone could enter them. The Midrash equated \\"The stranger did not lodge in the street,\\" with the words of (20:10 in the NJPS), (5:14 in the NJPS), and \\"And your stranger who is within your gates\\" (which implies that strangers were integrated into the midst of the community). Thus the Midrash taught that these verses reflect the Divine example of accepting all creatures.Exodus Rabbah 19:4. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 232. \\"Honor thy father and thy mother\\" (illustration from a Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company) The Mishnah taught that both men and women are obligated to carry out all commandments concerning their fathers.Mishnah Kiddushin 1:7. In, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 488. Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 29a, 30b. Rav Judah interpreted the Mishnah to mean that both men and women are bound to perform all precepts concerning a father that are incumbent upon a son to perform for his father.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30b. A Midrash noted that almost everywhere, Scripture mentions a father's honor before the mother's honor. (See, for example, (5:16 in NJPS), and (20:12 in NJSP).) But mentions the mother first to teach that one should honor both parents equally.Genesis Rabbah 1:15, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, pages 13‚Äì14. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita what it means to \\"honor\\" and \\"revere\\" one's parents within the meaning of (20:12 in NJSP) (honor), (revere), and (5:16 in NJPS) (honor). To \\"revere\\" means that the child must neither stand nor sit in the parent's place, nor contradict the parent's words, nor engage in a dispute to which the parent is a party. To \\"honor\\" means that the child must give the parent food and drink and clothes, and take the parent in and out.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 31b. Rabbi Tarfon taught that God came from Mount Sinai (or others say Mount Seir) and was revealed to the children of Esau, as says, \\"The Lord came from Sinai, and rose from Seir to them,\\" and \\"Seir\\" means the children of Esau, as says, \\"And Esau dwelt in Mount Seir.\\" God asked them whether they would accept the Torah, and they asked what was written in it. God answered that it included (in (20:13 in the NJPS) and (5:17 in the NJPS)), \\"You shall do no murder.\\" The children of Esau replied that they were unable to abandon the blessing with which Isaac blessed Esau in \\"By your sword shall you live.\\" From there, God turned and was revealed to the children of Ishmael, as says, \\"He shined forth from Mount Paran,\\" and \\"Paran\\" means the children of Ishmael, as says of Ishmael, \\"And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran.\\" God asked them whether they would accept the Torah, and they asked what was written in it. God answered that it included (in (20:13 in the NJPS) and (5:17 in the NJPS)), \\"You shall not steal.\\" The children of Ishamel replied that they were unable to abandon their fathers‚Äô custom, as Joseph said in (referring to the Ishamelites‚Äô transaction reported in ), \\"For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews.\\" From there, God sent messengers to all the nations of the world asking them whether they would accept the Torah, and they asked what was written in it. God answered that it included (in (20:3 in the NJPS) and (5:7 in the NJPS)), \\"You shall have no other gods before me.\\" They replied that they had no delight in the Torah, therefore let God give it to God's people, as says, \\"The Lord will give strength [identified with the Torah] to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.\\" From there, God returned and was revealed to the children of Israel, as says, \\"And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones,\\" and the expression \\"ten thousands\\" means the children of Israel, as says, \\"And when it rested, he said, ‚ÄòReturn, O Lord, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.‚Äô\\" With God were thousands of chariots and 20,000 angels, and God‚Äôs right hand held the Torah, as says, \\"At his right hand was a fiery law to them.\\"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 41.

Chapter 9 of Tractate Sanhedrin in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud interpreted the laws of murder in (20:13 in the NJPS) and (5:17 in the NJPS).Mishnah Sanhedrin 9:1‚Äì5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

Elucidated by Michoel Weiner and Asher Dicker; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 48, page 76b2‚Äì81b3. The Mishnah taught that one who intended to kill an animal but killed a person instead was not liable for murder. One was not liable for murder who intended to kill an unviable fetus and killed a viable child. One was not liable for murder who intended to strike the victim on the loins, where the blow was insufficient to kill, but struck the heart instead, where it was sufficient to kill, and the victim died. One was not liable for murder who intended to strike the victim on the heart, where it was enough to kill, but struck the victim on the loins, where it was not, and yet the victim died.Mishnah Sanhedrin 9:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

Elucidated by Michoel Weiner and Asher Dicker; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 48, page 78b3‚Äì79a1. Interpreting the consequences of murder (prohibited in (5:17 in NJPS) and (20:13 in NJPS)), the Mishnah taught that God created the first human (Adam) alone to teach that Scripture imputes guilt to one who destroys a single soul of Israel as though that person had destroyed a complete world, and Scripture ascribes merit to one who preserves a single soul of Israel as though that person had preserved a complete world.Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5.

Elucidated by Asher Dicker and Abba Zvi Naiman; edited by Hersh Goldwurm, volume 47, page 37a3. The Tanna Devei Eliyahu taught that if you live by the commandment prohibiting murder (in (20:13 in the NJPS) and (5:17 in the NJPS)), then (in the words of ) \\"the sword shall not go through your land.\\" If, however, you transgress the commandment, then (in God's words in ) \\"I will draw out the sword after you.\\"Tanna Devei Eliyahu.

(first century BCE parchment sheet from 4Q41, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls) Rav Aha of Difti said to Ravina that one can transgress the commandment not to covet in (5:18 in NJPS) and (20:14 in NJSP) even in connection with something for which one is prepared to pay.Babylonian Talmud Bava Metzia 5b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Edited by Hersh Goldwurm, volume 41, page 5b3. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1992. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael asked whether the commandment not to covet in (20:14 in NJSP) applied so far as to prohibit merely expressing one's desire for one's neighbor's things in words. But the Mekhilta noted that says, \\"You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself.\\" And the Mekhilta reasoned that just as in the word \\"covet\\" applies only to prohibit the carrying out of one's desire into practice, so also (20:14 in NJSP) prohibits only the carrying out of one's desire into practice.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael Bahodesh chapter 8. In, e.g., Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael. Translated by Jacob Z. Lauterbach, volume 2, page 337. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1933, reissued 2004. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Simeon distinguished the prohibition of (20:14 in NJSP), \\"You shall not covet,\\" from that of (5:18 in NJPS), \\"neither shall you desire.\\" The Mekhilta of Rabbi Simeon taught that the differing terms mean that one can incur liability for desiring in and of itself and for coveting in and of itself.Mekhilta of Rabbi Simeon, Tractate Bahodesh, chapter 55. Land of Israel, 5th century. In, e.g., Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. Translated by W. David Nelson, page 251. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2006. Rabbi Isaac deduced from (5:19 in NJPS) and that all the Sages who arose in every generation after the Revelation at Sinai received their wisdom from that event. Rabbi Isaac read to teach that the prophets received from the Revelation at Sinai all the messages that they were to prophesy to subsequent generations. For does not say, \\"who are not here standing with us this day,\\" but just \\"who are not with us this day.\\" Rabbi Isaac taught that thus refers to the souls that were to be created thereafter; because these souls did not yet have any substance in them, they could not yet be \\"standing\\" at Sinai. But although these souls did not yet exist, they still received their share of the Torah that day. Similarly, Rabbi Isaac concluded that all the Sages who arose in every generation thereafter received their wisdom from the Revelation at Sinai, for (5:19 in NJPS) says, \\"These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly . . . with a great voice, and it went on no more,\\" implying that God's Revelation went on no more thereafter.Exodus Rabbah 28:6. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by S.M. Lehrman, volume 3, pages 335‚Äì36. Rabbi Tanchum ben Chanilai found in God's calling to Moses alone in proof that a burden that is too heavy for 600,000 ‚Äî hearing the voice of God (see (5:22 in NJPS)) ‚Äî can be light for one.Leviticus Rabbah 1:1. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 4, page 3. The Gemara cited (5:27‚Äì28 in NJPS) to support the proposition that God approved of the decision of Moses to abstain from marital relations so as to remain pure for his communication with God. A Baraita taught that Moses did three things of his own understanding, and God approved: (1) He added one day of abstinence of his own understanding; (2) he separated himself from his wife (entirely, after the Revelation); and (3) he broke the Tables (on which God had written the Ten Commandments). The Gemara explained that to reach his decision to separate himself from his wife, Moses applied an a fortiori (kal va-chomer) argument to himself. Moses noted that even though the Shechinah spoke with the Israelites on only one definite, appointed time (at Mount Sinai), God nonetheless instructed in \\"Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.\\" Moses reasoned that if he heard from the Shechinah at all times and not only at one appointed time, how much more so should he abstain from marital contact. And the Gemara taught that we know that God approved, because in (5:27 in NJPS), God instructed Moses (after the Revelation at Sinai), \\"Go say to them, 'Return to your tents'\\" (thus giving the Israelites permission to resume marital relations) and immediately thereafter in (5:28 in NJPS), God told Moses, \\"But as for you, stand here by me\\" (excluding him from the permission to return). And the Gemara taught that some cite as proof of God's approval God's statement in \\"with him [Moses] will I speak mouth to mouth\\" (as God thus distinguished the level of communication God had with Moses, after Miriam and Aaron had raised the marriage of Moses and then questioned the distinctiveness of the prophecy of Moses).Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 87a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ‚Ä¢ Part Two. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 3, page 27. A Land Flowing with Milk and Honey (illustration from Henry Davenport Northrop's 1894 Treasures of the Bible) =Deuteronomy chapter 6= The Gemara reported a number of Rabbis' reports of how the Land of Israel did indeed flow with \\"milk and honey,\\" as described in and 17, and and and and 15, and Once when Rami bar Ezekiel visited Bnei Brak, he saw goats grazing under fig trees while honey was flowing from the figs, and milk dripped from the goats mingling with the fig honey, causing him to remark that it was indeed a land flowing with milk and honey. Rabbi Jacob ben Dostai said that it is about three miles from Lod to Ono, and once he rose up early in the morning and waded all that way up to his ankles in fig honey. Resh Lakish said that he saw the flow of the milk and honey of Sepphoris extend over an area of sixteen miles by sixteen miles. Rabbah bar Bar Hana said that he saw the flow of the milk and honey in all the Land of Israel and the total area was equal to an area of twenty-two parasangs by six parasangs.Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 111b‚Äì12a.

Already at the time of the Mishnah, constituted the first part of a standard Shema prayer that the priests recited daily, followed by and Mishnah Tamid 5:1. In, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 869. Babylonian Talmud Tamid 32b. The Rabbis taught that saying the words of \\"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One,\\" and no more, constituted Rabbi Judah the Prince's recital of the Shema. Rav once told Rabbi Hiyya that he had not witnessed Rabbi Judah the Prince accept upon himself the yoke of the Heaven by reciting the Shema. Rabbi Hiyya replied to Rav that in the moment that Rabbi Judah the Prince passed his hand to cover his eyes to recite, \\"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One,\\" he accepted upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 13b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 93. Rabbi Joshua ben Korhah taught that in the Shema, Jews recite the words of (\\"Here, O Israel . . . ,\\" Shema Yisrael . . .) before those of (\\"And it shall come to pass . . . ,\\" VeHaya im Shamoa . . .) so that one first accepts the yoke of Heaven by proclaiming the Unity of God and then accepts the yoke of the commandments by saying the words, \\"If you shall diligently heed all My commandments.\\" Jews recite the words of (\\"And it shall come to pass . . . ,\\" VeHaya im Shamoa . . .) before those of (\\"And the Lord said . . . ,\\" VaYomer . . .) because is applicable both in the day and the night (since it mentions all the commandments), whereas is applicable only in the day (since it mentions only the precept of fringes, tzitzit, which is not obligatory by night).Mishnah Berakhot 2:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 5. Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 13a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 89. The Mishnah taught that the absence of one of the two portions of scripture in the mezuzah ‚Äî and ‚Äî invalidates the other, and indeed even one imperfect letter can invalidates the whole.Mishnah Menachot 3:7, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2002. The Mishnah taught that the absence of one of the four portions of scripture in the Tefillin ‚Äî and 11‚Äì16 and and ‚Äî invalidates the others, and indeed even one imperfect letter can invalidate the whole.Mishnah Menachot 3:7, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

Reading \\"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One,\\" the Rabbis taught that God told Israel that all that God had created, God created in pairs: heaven and earth, sun and moon, Adam and Eve, this world and the World To Come. But God's Glory is One and Unique in the world.Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:31. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, pages 60‚Äì61. Rabbi Isaac linked the words \\"the Lord our God\\" in with \\"The Lord is my portion, says my soul.\\" Rabbi Isaac compared this to a king who entered a province with his generals, officials, and governors. Some of the citizens of the province chose a general as their patron, others an official, and others a governor. But the one who was cleverer than the rest chose the king as his patron, as all the other officials were liable to be changed, but the king would remain the king. Likewise, when God came down on Sinai, there also came down with God many companies of angels, Michael and his company, and Gabriel and his company. Some of the nations of the world chose Michael as their patron, and others chose Gabriel, but Israel chose God, exclaiming the words of \\"The Lord is my portion, says my soul,\\" and this is the force of the words \\"the Lord our God\\" in Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:34. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 63. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah read \\"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One,\\" to indicate that Israel has made God the sole object of Israel's love in the world. God, in turn, makes Israel the special object of God's love in the world, as 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles say, \\"And who is like Your people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth.\\"Numbers Rabbah 14:4. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 5, page 575. The Shema inscription on the Knesset Menorah in Jerusalem The Gemara explained that when Jews recite the Shema, they recite the words, \\"blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever,\\" quietly between the words, \\"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one,\\" from and the words, \\"And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might,\\" from for the reason that Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish expounded when he explained what happened in That verse reports, \\"And Jacob called to his sons, and said: ‚ÄòGather yourselves together, that I may tell you what will befall you in the end of days.'\\" According to Rabbi Simeon, Jacob wished to reveal to his sons what would happen in the end of the days, but just then, the Shechinah departed from him. So Jacob said that perhaps, Heaven forefend, he had fathered a son who was unworthy to hear the prophecy, just as Abraham had fathered Ishmael or Isaac had fathered Esau. But his sons answered him (in the words of ), \\"Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One,\\" explaining that just as there was only One in Jacob's heart, so there was only One in their hearts. And Jacob replied, \\"Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever.\\" The Rabbis considered that Jews might recite \\"Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever\\" aloud, but rejected that option, as Moses did not say those words in The Rabbis considered that Jews might not recite those words at all, but rejected that option, as Jacob did say the words. So the Rabbis ruled that Jews should recite the words quietly. Rabbi Isaac taught that the School of Rabbi Ammi said that one can compare this practice to that of a princess who smelled a spicy pudding. If she revealed her desire for the pudding, she would suffer disgrace; but if she concealed her desire, she would suffer deprivation. So her servants brought her pudding secretly. Rabbi Abbahu taught that the Sages ruled that Jews should recite the words aloud, so as not to allow heretics to claim that Jews were adding improper words to the Shema. But in Nehardea, where there were no heretics so far, they recited the words quietly.Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 56a. See also Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:35. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 64. Rabbi Phinehas ben Hama taught that the Israelites merited to recite the Shema at the Revelation on Sinai, for it was with the word Shema that God first began to speak at Sinai when God said in 6: \\"Hear, O Israel . . . I am the Lord your God,\\" and the Israelites all answered with the words of \\"The Lord our God, the Lord is One.\\" And Moses said, \\"Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.\\"Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:31. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 60. The Rabbis told that when Moses ascended to heaven, he heard the ministering angels saying to God, \\"Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.\\" Moses brought this declaration down to Israel. Rav Assi explained why Jews do not make this declaration aloud, comparing this to a man who took jewelry from the royal palace and gave it to his wife, telling her not to wear it in public, but only in the house. But on the Day of Atonement, when Jews are as pure as the ministering angels, they do recite the declaration aloud.Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:36. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 64. Rabbi Johanan considered twice daily recitation of the Shema () to fulfill the commandment of that \\"this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate therein day and night.\\" Rabbi Jose interpreted the analogous term \\"continually\\" (, tamid) in which says \\"And on the table you shall set the bread of display, to be before [God] continually.\\" Rabbi Jose taught that even if they took the old bread of display away in the morning and placed the new bread on the table only in the evening, they had honored the commandment to set the bread \\"continually.\\" Rabbi Ammi analogized from this teaching of Rabbi Jose that people who learn only one chapter of Torah in the morning and one chapter in the evening have nonetheless fulfilled the precept of that \\"this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate therein day and night.\\" And thus Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that even people who read just the Shema morning and evening thereby fulfill the precept of Rabbi Johanan taught that it is forbidden, however, to teach this to people who through ignorance are careless in the observance of the laws (as it might deter them from further Torah study). But Rava taught that it is meritorious to say it in their presence (as they might think that if merely reciting the Shema twice daily earns reward, how great would the reward be for devoting more time to Torah study).Babylonian Talmud Menachot 99b. the Hebrew letter dalet the Hebrew letter resh A Midrash warned that if one changed the Hebrew letter dalet () in the word , echad (\\"one\\") in into the letter resh () (changing the word from \\"one\\" to \\"strange\\") one could cause the destruction of the Universe.Leviticus Rabbah 19:2. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 4, page 237. A Midrash interpreted \\"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart; behold, he stands behind our wall,\\" to apply to God's Presence in the synagogue. The Midrash read the words, \\"behold, He stands behind our wall,\\" to allude to the occasion in when God came to visit Abraham on the third day after Abraham's circumcision. says, \\"And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat (, yoshev) . . . .\\" The word for \\"he sat\\" is in a form that can be read yashav, the letter vav () being omitted, as though it read that Abraham was sitting before he saw God, but on seeing God, he wanted to stand up. But God told him to sit, as Abraham would serve as a symbol for his children, for when his children would come into their synagogues and houses of study and recite the Shema, they would be sitting down and God's Glory would stand by. To support this reading, the Midrash cited \\"God stands in the congregation of God.\\"Numbers Rabbah 11:2. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 5, pages 414‚Äì15. A Midrash taught that when Jews rise from their sleep and quickly proceed to read the Shema, thus proclaiming the sovereignty of God, they become like lions. Then as they set out on their worldly affairs, if they stumble over any sin, or if destroying demons approach them, they proclaim the sovereignty of God. When they recite the words of \\"The Lord is One,\\" the destroying demons are consumed; they whisper, \\"Blessed be His Name whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever\\" (conceding God's sovereignty); and they flee. By virtue of reading the Shema, Jews are supported by angelic watchers of the day and entrusted to the watchers of the night. When, on awakening, they again proclaim the sovereignty of God, the watchers of the night hand them over to the watchers of the day, as can be read to say, \\"My soul is entrusted to the Lord; from the time of the watchers of the morning to that of the watchers of the following morning.\\"Numbers Rabbah 20:20. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 6, page 815. A Midrash taught that great is peace, for the world could not be maintained except by peace, and the Torah is wholly peace, as says, \\"Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\\" The reading of the Shema concludes (in the Evening, Maariv, Prayer Service) with the words: \\"He spreads the tabernacle of peace over His people.\\" The Amidah prayer concludes with peace. And the Priestly Blessing concludes with peace. Rabbi Simeon ben Halafta observed that there is no vessel that holds a blessing save peace, as says, \\"The Lord will give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.\\"Numbers Rabbah 21:1. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 6, page 827. A Midrash asked to which commandment refers when it says, \\"For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment that I command you, to do it, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him, then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.\\" Rabbi Levi said that \\"this commandment\\" refers to the recitation of the Shema, but the Rabbis said that it refers to the Sabbath, which is equal to all the precepts of the Torah. The Mishnah read the words \\"and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart\\" in to teach that one should love God with one's two impulses ‚Äî the evil impulse and the good ‚Äî and thus that a person should bless God for the evil in the world as well as the good. The Mishnah read the words \\"with all your soul\\" in to mean that one should love God even if it means God takes one's life. And the Mishnah read the words \\"with all your might\\" in to mean with all one's wealth. Alternatively, \\"with all your might (me'odeka)\\" means that one should love God whatever \\"measure\\" (middah, a play on me'odeka) God metes out.Mishnah Berakhot 9:5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 14. Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 54a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 349. Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012. Detail of fish (wall painting from the Egyptian Tomb of Menna circa 1422‚Äì1411 B.C.E.) The Rabbis taught that once the Roman government forbade Jews to study the Torah. Pappus ben Judah found Rabbi Akiva publicly gathering people to study Torah and asked Akiva whether he did not fear the government. Akiva replied with a parable: A fox was once walking alongside of a river, and he saw fish swimming from one place to another. The fox asked the fish from what they fled. The fish replied that they fled from the nets cast by men. The fox invited the fish to come up onto the dry land, so that they could live together as the fox's ancestors had lived with the fish's ancestors. The fish replied that for an animal described as the cleverest of animals, the fox was rather foolish. For if the fish were afraid in the element in which they live, how much more would they fear in the element in which they would die. Akiva said that it was the same with Jews. If such was the Jews‚Äô condition when they sat and studied Torah, of which says, \\"that is your life and the length of your days,\\" how much worse off would Jews be if they neglected the Torah! Soon afterwards, the Romans arrested and imprisoned Rabbi Akiva, and the Romans arrested Pappus ben Judah and imprisoned him next to Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva asked Pappus who had brought him there. Pappus replied that Rabbi Akiva was happy that he had been seized for occupying himself with the Torah. Pappus regretted that he had been seized for occupying himself with idle things. When the Romans took Rabbi Akiva out for execution, it was the hour for the recital of the Shema, and while they combed his flesh with iron combs, he was accepting upon himself the kingship of Heaven by reciting (\\"Here, O Israel . . . ,\\" Shema Yisrael . . .). His disciples asked him whether his devotion extended even to that point. He replied that all his days, he had been troubled by \\"with all your soul,\\" which he interpreted to mean, \\"even if God takes one's soul.\\" Rabbi Akiva questioned when he would have the opportunity to fulfill this. Now that he had the opportunity, he asked his disciples, should he not fulfill it? He prolonged the word \\"One\\" (ehad) in until he expired while saying it. A Heavenly voice went forth and proclaimed: Happy are you, Akiva, that your soul has departed with the word \\"One\\"! The ministering angels asked God: Such devotion to Torah, and such a reward? The angels argued that he should have received the reward of \\"from them that die by Your hand, O Lord.\\" God replied to the angels (in the continuation of ), \\"Their portion is in life,\\" and a Heavenly voice proclaimed that Rabbi Akiva was destined for the life of the World to Come.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 61b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, pages 395‚Äì96. Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak that it was resolved by a majority vote in the upper chambers of the house of Nithza in Lydda that in every other law of the Torah, if a person is forced to choose between transgressing the commandment and death, he may transgress and not die, excepting idolatry, incest (including adultery), and murder. The Gemara questioned whether that would mean that one could practice idolatry to avoid being killed. Rabbi Ishmael taught that if a person is forced to choose between idolatry and death, the person should do so, and not be killed, for says, \\"You shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which if a man does, he shall live in them\\" ‚Äî not die by them. The Gemara questioned whether one might think that idolatry may even be practiced openly, says, \\"Neither shall you profane My Holy Name; but I will be hallowed,\\" and as the public violation of commandments profanes God's Name, one might think that one must die to avoid doing so. The Sages ruled with Rabbi Eliezer, who cited \\"And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your might.\\" Rabbi Eliezer taught that since says, \\"with all your soul,\\" there must be a reason that also says, \\"with all your might [that is, worldly resources],\\" and vice versa. stated? Rabbi Eliezer taught that says, \\"with all your soul\\" for the person to whom life is more precious than wealth, and says, \\"with all your soul\\" to teach that one must be prepared even to give one's life in God's service; while to one to whom wealth is more precious than life says, \\"with all your might\\" (that is, wealth). Thus the Sages decided that one must incur a martyr's death rather than practice idolatry, for \\"and you shall love the Lord your God,\\" means that one must not worship any other in God's place.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 74a, in, e.g., The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition. Commentary by Adin Steinsaltz (Even Yisrael), volume 19, pages 72‚Äì74. New York: Random House, 1999. See also Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 61b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 395. (reporting Rabbi Eliezer‚Äôs analysis) mezuzah text Abaye interpreted the words \\"and you shall love the Lord your God\\" in to teach that one should strive through one's actions to cause others to love the Name of Heaven. So that if people see that those who study Torah and Mishnah are honest in business and speak pleasantly, then they will accord honor to the Name of God. But if people see that those who study Torah and Mishnah are dishonest in business and discourteous, then they will associate their shortcomings with their being Torah scholars.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 86a. In the heart loves, and in the heart takes in words.

In God announced that God would \\"put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession.\\" Rabbi Hiyya asked: Was it then a piece of good news that plagues were to come upon them? Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai answered that when the Canaanites heard that the Israelites were approaching, they hid their valuables in their houses. But God promised the Israelites' forbearers that God would bring the Israelites into a land full of good things, including, in the words of , \\"houses full of all good things.\\" So God brought plagues upon a house of one of the Israelites so that when he would pull it down, he would find a treasure.Leviticus Rabbah 17:6. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 4, pages 220‚Äì21. Noting that commands, \\"The Lord your God you shall fear and you shall serve,\\" and commands, \\"You shall fear your father and mother,\\" the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that Scripture likens the fear of parents to the fear of God. As (20:12 in NJSP) commands, \\"Honor your father and your mother,\\" and directs, \\"Honor the Lord with your substance,\\" Scripture likens the honor due to parents to that due to God. And as commands, \\"He that curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death,\\" and commands, \\"Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin,\\" Scripture likens cursing parents to cursing God. But the Baraita conceded that with respect to striking (which addresses with regard to parents), that it is certainly impossible (with respect to God). The Baraita concluded that these comparisons between parents and God are only logical, since the three (God, the mother, and the father) are partners in creation of the child. For the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that there are three partners in the creation of a person ‚Äî God, the father, and the mother. When one honors one's father and mother, God considers it as if God had dwelt among them and they had honored God. And a Tanna taught before Rav Nachman that when one vexes one's father and mother, God considers it right not to dwell among them, for had God dwelt among them, they would have vexed God.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30b‚Äì31a. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that there are four types of children (as evinced by the four times ‚Äî in and ‚Äî that Scripture reports telling a child) ‚Äî the wise, the simple, the wicked, and the type who does not know how to ask. The wise child asks, in the words of ‚ÄúWhat mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, that the Lord our God has commanded you?‚Äù The Mekhilta taught that we explain to this child all the laws of Passover. The simple child asks, in the words of ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù The Mekhilta taught that we respond simply with the words of ‚ÄúBy strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.‚Äù The wicked child asks, in the words of ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by this service?‚Äù The Mekhilta taught that because wicked children exclude themselves, we should also exclude this child in answering and say, in the words of ‚ÄúIt is because of what the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt‚Äù ‚Äî for me but not for you; had you been there, you would not have been saved. As for the child who does not know how to ask, the Mekhilta taught that we take the initiative, as says (without having reported that the child asked), ‚ÄúYou shall tell your child on that day.‚ÄùMekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Tractate Pisha, chapter 18. In, e.g., Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael. Translated by Jacob Z. Lauterbach, volume 1, page 113. =Deuteronomy chapter 7= A Midrash expounded on why Israel was, in the words of like \\"a leafy olive tree.\\" In one explanation, the Midrash taught that just as all liquids commingle one with the other, but oil refuses to do so, so Israel keeps itself distinct, as it is commanded in Exodus Rabbah 36:1. In, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by S.M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 437. In medieval Jewish interpretation The parashah is discussed in these medieval Jewish sources:For more on medieval Jewish interpretation, see, e.g., Barry D.

Edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, pages 1891‚Äì1915. =Deuteronomy chapter 4= Reading , \\"Observe therefore and do them, for this is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the nations that, when they hear all these statutes, they shall say: 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people,'\\" Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda taught that it is one‚Äôs duty to study created things and to deduce from them the wisdom of the Creator.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot (Duties of the Heart), section 2, chapter 2 (Zaragoza, Al-Andalus, circa 1080), in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman (Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 1996), volume 1, pages 172‚Äì75. Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda saw Moses warning against thinking that God has a form or likeness, when in , he said, \\"Take therefore good heed; for you saw no manner of form on the day that the Lord spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire,\\" and in , he said, \\"And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no form; only you heard a voice.\\" Ba·∏•ya taught that by saying \\"take good heed,\\" Moses was warning people in their minds and thoughts to not represent God in any form or to conceive God in the likeness of any thing or any comparison, since the Israelites‚Äô eyes never perceived any form or likeness when God spoke to them.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 1, chapter 10, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 132‚Äì33. Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda argued that the greatest benefit that God bestowed on humanity and the strongest proof of God's existence is the Torah that God gave humanity and God's manifestation of God's presence, as says, \\"Unto you it was shown, that you may know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him. Out of Heaven He made you to hear His voice, that He might instruct you; and upon earth He made you to see His great fire; and you did hear His words out of the midst of the fire.\\"Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 2, chapter 5, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 216‚Äì17. In the exhortation of , \\"know this day and consider within your heart, that the Lord is God in Heaven above and on the earth below,\\" Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda found a duty to investigate through rational inquiry the roots of the religion and the foundations of the Torah.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Introduction, Chovot HaLevavot, section 1, chapter 2, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 20‚Äì23, 28‚Äì29, 74‚Äì77. Ba·∏•ya taught that one should exert one's mind until one knows God through the evidences of God's works but not strive to know God in God's glorious essence. For God is close to humanity from the perspective of God's deeds but infinitely remote in any representation of God's essence or comparison with it; one can never find God in that way. Ba·∏•ya contended that when one abandons trying to find God through one's conjectures and senses (because God cannot be grasped in that way), and instead finds God in the evidence of God's deeds, then one will have reached the pinnacle of knowledge of God to which Moses exhorted us in saying in , \\"Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the Lord He is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.\\"Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 1, chapter 10, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 140‚Äì43. In the Torah‚Äôs teaching (in , , and and ) that one who killed another unintentionally did not incur capital punishment, Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda found proof that an essential condition of liability for punishment is the association of mind and body in a forbidden act ‚Äî that liability requires both intention and action.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, Introduction, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 16‚Äì17. =Deuteronomy chapter 5= Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda argued that because the wholehearted acceptance of the unity of God is the root and foundation of Judaism, God's first words to the Israelites at Mount Sinai in (20:2‚Äì3 in NJPS) and (5:6‚Äì7 in NJPS) were: \\"I am the Lord your God . . . you shall not have other gods before Me,\\" and then God exhorted the Israelites through Moses, saying in : \\"Hear O Israel the Lord, is our God, the Lord is One.\\"Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 1, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 62‚Äì63. Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda read the words \\"You shall not murder\\" in (20:13 in NJPS) and (5:17 in NJPS) to prohibit suicide, as well as murdering any other human being. Ba·∏•ya reasoned that the closer the murdered is to the murderer, the more the punishment should be severe, and thus the punishment for those who kill themselves will undoubtedly be very great. Ba·∏•ya taught that for that reason, people should not recklessly endanger their lives.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 4, chapter 4, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 400‚Äì03. Citing (5:18 in NJPS), Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda taught that not to covet is a leading example of an negative duty of the heart.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, Introduction, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 14‚Äì15. Moses Maimonides Interpreting the prohibition of coveting in (20:14 in NJSP) and desiring in (5:18 in NJPS), Maimonides taught that any person who covets a servant, a maidservant, a house, or utensils that belong to a colleague, or any other article that the person can purchase from the colleague and pressures the colleague with friends and requests until the colleague agrees to sell, violates a negative commandment, even though the person pays much money for it, as (20:14 in NJSP) says, \\"Do not covet.\\" Maimonides taught that the violation of this commandment was not punished by lashes, because it does not involve a deed. Maimonides taught that a person does not violate (20:14 in NJSP) until the person actually takes the article that the person covets, as reflected by \\"Do not covet the gold and silver on these statues and take it for yourself.\\" Maimonides read the word for \\"covet\\" in both (20:14 in NJSP) and to refer to coveting accompanied by a deed. Maimonides taught that a person who desires a home, a spouse, utensil, or anything else belonging to a colleague that the person can acquire violates a negative commandment when the person thinks in the person's heart how it might be possible to acquire this thing from the colleague. Maimonides read (5:18 in NJPS), \\"Do not desire,\\" to refer even to feelings in the heart alone. Thus, a person who desires another person's property violates one negative commandment. A person who purchases an object the person desires after pressuring the owners and repeatedly asking them, violates two negative commandments. For that reason, Maimonides concluded, the Torah prohibits both desiring in (5:18 in NJPS) and coveting in (20:14 in NJSP). And if the person takes the article by robbery, the person violates three negative commandments.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sefer Mezikin, Hilkhot Gezelah va-Avedah, chapter 1, halachot 9‚Äì12. Egypt. Circa 1170‚Äì1180. In, e.g., Mishneh Torah: Sefer Mezikin . Translated by Eliyahu Touger, pages 238‚Äì40. New York: Moznaim, Publishing, 1997. Isaac Abrabanel noted that the order of (20:14 in NJSP), \\"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife,\\" differs from that in (5:18 in NJPS), \\"Neither shall you covet thy neighbor's wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor's house.\\" Abrabanel deduced that (20:14 in NJSP) mentions the things that might be coveted in the order that a person has need of them, and what it behooves a person to try to acquire in this world. Therefore, the first coveted item mentioned is a person's house, then the person's spouse, then the person's servants, and lastly the person's animals that do not speak. (5:18 in NJPS), however, mentions them in the order of the gravity of the sin and evil. The most evil coveting is that of another person's spouse, as in David's coveting of Bathsheba. Next in magnitude of evil comes coveting the house in which one's neighbor lives, lest the person evict the neighbor and take the neighbor's home. Next comes the neighbor's field, for although a person does not live there as in the house, it is the source of the neighbor's livelihood and inheritance, as in the affair of Ahab and the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. After the field (5:18 in NJPS) mentions servants, who Abrabanel valued of lesser importance than one's field. Next come the neighbor's animals, who do not have the faculty of speech, and lastly, to include the neighbor's inanimate moveable property, (5:18 in NJPS) says \\"and anything that is your neighbor's.\\"Isaac Abrabanel. Commentary on the Torah. Quoted in Judah Zoldan. \\"Is Marketing Coveting? (August 13, 2011). =Deuteronomy chapter 6= Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda argued that encompasses 10 matters, corresponding to the Ten Commandments. Five of these matters concern the spiritual (mind/heart): (1) That the Creator exists. (2) God is our God. (3) God is the true Unity. (4) That we love God with all our heart. (5) That we serve God wholeheartedly. And five of these matters concern the physical (the body): (1) You shall teach them to your children. (2) You shall speak in them. (3) You shall bind them as a sign on your hand. (4) They shall be as frontlet between your eyes. (5) You shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gates.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 1, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 62‚Äì67. Ba·∏•ya interpreted the words of , \\"Hear O Israel the Lord,\\" as a command to believe in the Creator. Ba·∏•ya read the word \\"hear\\" not to call for hearing of the ear, but for belief and acceptance of the heart, as in , \\"we will do and we will hear,\\" and , \\"Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it.\\"Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 1, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 62‚Äì65. Citing , Ba·∏•ya taught that love for God is a leading example of an affirmative duty of the heart.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, Introduction, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 14‚Äì15. Ba·∏•ya interpreted the words of , \\"And these words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart,\\" to mean that one should always keep them in one‚Äôs heart and believe them in one‚Äôs inner being. And Ba·∏•ya interpreted the words of , \\"and you shall speak in them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up,\\" to teach that these duties of the heart are a constant duty. By keeping these words continually on one‚Äôs lips, they will always be in one‚Äôs consciousness, and one‚Äôs thoughts will never be empty of God.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 1, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 64‚Äì65. Maimonides cited the words of \\"And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might,\\" for the proposition that even when one's life is threatened, one should not commit one of the three sins of the worship of false gods, forbidden sexual relations, and murder. The words \\"with all your soul\\" in imply: even if it takes one's soul.Maimonides. Mishneh Torah: Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah (The Laws that Are the Foundations of the Torah), chapter 5, halachah 7. Egypt, circa 1170‚Äì1180. In, e.g., Mishneh Torah: Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah: The Laws [which Are] the Foundations of the Torah. Translated by Eliyahu Touger, volume 1, pages 220‚Äì23. New York: Moznaim Publishing, 1989. Reading the words of , \\"You shall not try the Lord, your God,\\" Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda taught that people should thus not put themselves in danger while trusting on God's decree that they will live a set time, drinking poisonous drink or going to battle lions or other dangerous animals without necessity, or casting themselves into the sea or into fire, or other similar things that put their lives in danger.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 4, chapter 4, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 400‚Äì03. Na·∏•manides Na·∏•manides read , \\"Do what is right and good in the sight of the Eternal,\\" to reflect the intent that whereas previously, Moses stated that one is to keep the particular statutes that God commanded, here Moses is saying that even where God has not commanded, one should give thought to doing what is good and right in God‚Äôs eyes, for God loves the good and the right. Na·∏•manides considered this is a great principle, for it was impossible for the Torah to mention all aspects of people‚Äôs conduct with their neighbors and friends, and all their various transactions, and the ordinances of all societies and countries. But since God mentioned many of them, Moses here stated in a general way that, in all matters, one should do what is good and right, including even compromise and going beyond the requirements of the law. Thus, Na·∏•manides taught, people should seek to refine their behavior in every form of activity, until they are worthy of being called \\"good and upright.\\"Na·∏•manides, Commentary on the Torah (Jerusalem, circa 1270), in, e.g., Charles B. Chavel, translator, Ramban (Nachmanides): Commentary on the Torah: Deuteronomy (New York: Shilo Publishing House, 1976) volume 5, page 88. =Deuteronomy chapter 7= Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda taught that whenever God singles out a person for special favor, that person is under an obligation of increased service as an expression of gratitude for that favor. Ba·∏•ya reasoned that because of this, when some good fortune happened to the righteous of ancient times, they were troubled for two reasons: First, that they should not fall short in the fulfillment of the service and gratitude that they owed for this good fortune and that it should not turn into misfortune for them, as Jacob said in , \\"I have diminished from all the mercies, and truth which You have shown to Your servant.\\" And secondly, that this should not be God's reward for their service, at the expense of their reward in the World To Come, as the Sages explained , \\"And repays them that hate Him to their face (during this life) to destroy them (in the hereafter).\\"Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 3, chapter 6, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 310‚Äì11. Similarly, Ba·∏•ya cited the words of , \\"And He repays those He hates to their face, to destroy them,\\" to help explain why sometimes God sends good to the wicked because of previous good deed that they did, to pay them in this world.Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot, section 4, chapter 3, in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman, volume 1, pages 390‚Äì91. In modern interpretation The parashah is discussed in these modern sources: Mendelssohn =Deuteronomy chapter 4= The 18th- century German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn read the admonition of \\"Therefore, know and take it to heart that the Lord alone is God, in heaven above and on the earth below, and there is none else,\\" along with that of \\"Hear, O Israel, the Eternal, our God, is a unique, eternal being!\\" to demonstrate that whenever it is a question of the eternal truths of reason, Scripture does not say \\"believe,\\" but \\"understand\\" and \\"know,\\" in order that we may know that the Eternal is the true God, and there is no other. Nowhere does Scripture say: \\"Believe, O Israel, and you will be blessed; do not doubt, O Israel, or this or that punishment will befall you.\\" Thus Mendelssohn concluded that Scripture does not command faith, but accepts no other commands than those that come by way of conviction. Its propositions are presented to the understanding, submitted for consideration, without being forced upon our belief. Belief and doubt, assent and opposition, in Mendelssohn's view, are not determined by desire, wishes, longings, fear, or hope, but by knowledge of truth and untruth. Hence, Mendelssohn concluded, ancient Judaism has no articles of faith.Moses Mendelssohn.Jerusalem, ¬ß 2. Berlin, 1783. In Jerusalem: Or on Religious Power and Judaism. Translated by Allan Arkush; introduction and commentary by Alexander Altmann, page 100. Hanover, New Hampshire: Brandeis University Press, 1983. Plaut The 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut argued that the discussions of cities of refuge in and and were composed during a later, settled period, in order to accommodate the disappearance of local altars that previously served as places of refuge.W. Gunther Plaut. The Torah: A Modern Commentary: Revised Edition. Revised edition edited by David E.S. Stern, page 1118. Holmes Explaining the origins of the law that one can see in the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of legal procedure were grounded in vengeance. Roman law and German law started from the blood feud, which led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off. Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud was pretty well broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house- burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar to lawyers.Oliver Wendell Holmes. The Common Law, lecture 1. London: Macmillan & Co., 1881. In, e.g., Dover Publications, Revised edition, 1991. =Deuteronomy chapter 5= In 1980, in the case of Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court of the United States held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute that required posting the Ten Commandments on the wall of each public classroom in the state. The Court noted that some of the Commandments apply to arguably secular matters, such those at , on honoring one's parents, murder, adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness. But the Court also observed that the first part of the Commandments, in , concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day. Thus the Court concluded that the pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls was plainly religious.Stone v. Graham, . In 1950, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism ruled: ‚ÄúRefraining from the use of a motor vehicle is an important aid in the maintenance of the Sabbath spirit of repose. Such restraint aids, moreover, in keeping the members of the family together on the Sabbath. However where a family resides beyond reasonable walking distance from the synagogue, the use of a motor vehicle for the purpose of synagogue attendance shall in no wise be construed as a violation of the Sabbath but, on the contrary, such attendance shall be deemed an expression of loyalty to our faith. . . . [I]n the spirit of a living and developing Halachah responsive to the changing needs of our people, we declare it to be permitted to use electric lights on the Sabbath for the purpose of enhancing the enjoyment of the Sabbath, or reducing personal discomfort in the performance of a mitzvah.‚ÄùMorris Adler, Jacob B.

Jerusalem: The Rabbinical Assembly and The Institute of Applied Hallakhah, 1997. =Deuteronomy chapter 6= Dr. Nathan MacDonald of St John's College, Cambridge, reported some dispute over the exact meaning of the description of the Land of Israel as a \\"land flowing with milk and honey,\\" as in and 17, 13:5, and 33:3, and 14:8, and 11:9, 26:9 and 15, 27:3, and 31:20. MacDonald wrote that the term for milk (, chalav) could easily be the word for \\"fat\\" (, chelev), and the word for honey (, devash) could indicate not bees' honey but a sweet syrup made from fruit. The expression evoked a general sense of the bounty of the land and suggested an ecological richness exhibited in a number of ways, not just with milk and honey. MacDonald noted that the expression was always used to describe a land that the people of Israel had not yet experienced, and thus characterized it as always a future expectation.Nathan MacDonald. What Did the Ancient Israelites Eat? Diet in Biblical Times, page 7. Plaut observed that the precise meaning of the six words of the Shema in is not at all clear. In the Hebrew, after the opening \\"Hear, O Israel,\\" the affirmation itself states tersely: \\"Eternal our God Eternal echad.\\" Plaut wrote that the text can be understood to say: : is our God, and alone; : is our God, one indivisible ; : our God is a unique ; : is our God, is unique (in extraordinariness).W. Gunther Plaut. The Torah: A Modern Commentary: Revised Edition. Revised edition edited by David E.S. Stern, page 1210. Driver The early 20th century Oxford professor Samuel Rolles Driver taught that sets out the fundamental truth of Israel's religion, the uniqueness and unity of God, and the fundamental duty founded upon it of the devotion to God of the Israelite's entire being. Reading Driver asked in what sense the word \\"One\\" is to be understood: Does it express the Unity of God, declaring that God is in God's essence indivisible, and cannot ‚Äî like Ba'al and Ashtoret, for instance, who are often spoken of in the plural ‚Äî assume different phases or attributes, as presiding over different localities, or different departments of nature, and cannot further be united syncretistically with other deities; but is only known under the one character by which God has revealed God's Self to Israel? Or does the word \\"One\\" denote the Uniqueness of God, representing God in a unique sense, as the God with whom no other god can be compared, as the only Deity to whom the true attributes of the Godhead really belong? Driver taught that the second interpretation gives the higher and fuller meaning to the term, and forms also a more adequate basis for the practical duty inculcated in for a God, who was not unique might not necessarily be a worthy object of human love. Driver taught that the first interpretation, however, is not excluded by the second, for the unity of God is almost a necessary corollary of God's Uniqueness. Driver concluded that is thus a great declaration of Monotheism in the sense both that there is only one God, and also that the God who exists is truly One. Driver taught that the truth is one which in its full significance was only gradually brought home to the Israelites and was hardly explicitly enunciated much before the age of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah. Driver read verses like and to imply that God is superior to \\"other gods\\" or that \\"other gods\\" cannot be compared to God, but not to deny the real existence of \\"other gods.\\" Driver argued that it was only gradually seen distinctly, and taught explicitly, not only that God is unique among \\"other gods,\\" but that \\"other gods\\" have no real existence whatever beside God.Samuel R. Driver. A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Deuteronomy, pages 89‚Äì91. (citing for the last proposition 39; 6, 14, 18, 21; ). Spinoza Baruch Spinoza listed the proposition in that God is One second among the doctrines of universal faith and the fundamental dogmas of Scripture that tend to the central doctrine that there exists a God, a Supreme Being, Who loves justice and charity, and Who must be obeyed by whoever would be saved, and that the worship of God consists in the practice of justice and love towards one's neighbor. Spinoza argued that no one could dispute that the doctrine that God is One is absolutely necessary for entire devotion, admiration, and love towards God, for devotion, admiration, and love spring from the superiority of one over all else.Baruch Spinoza. Theologico-Political Treatise, chapter 14. Amsterdam, 1670. In, e.g., Baruch Spinoza. Theological-Political Treatise. Translated by Samuel Shirley, pages 162‚Äì63. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, second edition, 2001. Gerald Janzen, Professor Emeritus of Old Testament at Christian Theological Seminary, grouped interpretations of the word , echad, in into two sorts: a word that says something about God (for example, \\"One\\" or \\"Unique\\") or a word that says something about God's claim on Israel (for example, \\"alone\\"). Concluding that one should read the word as \\"One,\\" Jansen argued that the claim upon Israel to love God with all its heart and soul and strength in follows upon an affirmation that God is \\"One,\\" and this affirmation is to identify in God the dependable ground upon which an exhortation to wholehearted loyalty may appropriately be made.J.

Interpreting John Wesley wrote that \\"Sinners, especially presumptuous sinners, are said to tempt God, that is, to make a trial of God, whether he be so wise as to see their sins, [or] so just and true and powerful as to take vengeance on them, concerning which they are very apt to doubt because of the present impunity and prosperity of many such persons.\\"John Wesley's Notes on the Bible on Deuteronomy 6:16.

For Parashah Va'etchanan, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Hoseni, the maqam that expresses beauty, because this is the parashah where Moses repeats to the Israelites their history of receiving the Ten Commandments.See Mark L. Kligman. \\"The Bible, Prayer, and Maqam: Extra-Musical Associations of Syrian Jews.\\" Ethnomusicology, volume 45 (number 3) (Autumn 2001): pages 443‚Äì479. Mark L. Kligman.

Isaiah (fresco by Michelangelo) Haftarah The parashah is always read on the special Sabbath Shabbat Nachamu, the Sabbath immediately after Tisha B'Av. Shabbat Nachamu (\\"Sabbath of comfort\\") takes its name from the first word of the haftarah for the parashah, which speaks of \\"comforting\\" the Jewish people for their suffering ‚Äî , nachamu nachamu, ami, \\"Be comforted, be comforted, My nation....\\" The haftarah is the first in the cycle of seven haftarot of consolation after Tisha B'Av, leading up to Rosh Hashanah. \\"God sits above the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.\\" =Summary= God told the prophet to comfort God's people and bid Jerusalem to take heart, as the city's guilt had been paid off. A voice in the wilderness called to clear the way and make a highway for God, for every valley will be lifted up, every mountain will be made low, and God's glory will be revealed to all. A voice proclaimed that all flesh is grass, its goodness like a flower of the field, which withers and fades; but God's word will stand forever. The herald of good tidings should go to the mountain and announce to the cities of Judah that God will come as a Mighty One to rule, as a shepherd that feeds the flock, gathers the lambs, carries them, and gently leads them. \\"Lift up your eyes on high, and see: Who has created these?\\" Who has held the waters in hand, measured the heavens, comprehended the earth, and weighed mountains in the balance? Who has counseled or instructed God? Nations are like a drop in a bucket, like dust in the balance, as nothing before God. Can one compare God to anything, to an idol that a woodworker carved? God sits above the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers. God brings princes to nothing, makes the judges of the earth like nothing; scarcely are they planted, but God blows upon them, and they wither and blow away. To whom then to liken God? Lift up your eyes and see: The One who created the stars, called them by name, by the greatness of God's might and strong power each one appears. =Connection to the Special Sabbath= The haftarah answers laments read on Tisha B'Av from the book of Lamentations. and 9 complain that Jerusalem \\"has none to comfort her,\\" \\"she has no comforter.\\" In the haftarah answers, \\"Comfort, comfort My people, says your God.\\" complains that \\"the ways of Zion mourn.\\" In the haftarah answers, \\"Clear in the wilderness the way of the Lord, make plain in the desert a highway for our God.\\" complains that Zion's princes \\"are gone without strength before the pursuer.\\" In and 26, the haftarah answers, \\"lift up your voice with strength,\\" God \\"is strong in power.\\" hoped for Jerusalem that \\"the punishment of your iniquity is accomplished\\" and God \\"will no more carry you away into captivity.\\" In the haftarah affirms, \\"Bid Jerusalem take heart, and proclaim to her, that her time of service is accomplished, that her guilt is paid off.\\" As well, the haftarah echoes the parashah. In the parashah in Moses pleads, \\"Let me go over, I pray, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill-country, and Lebanon.\\" As if in answer, the haftarah rejoins in \\"the nations are as a drop of a bucket, . . . and Lebanon is not sufficient fuel, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for burnt-offerings.\\" Notes Further reading The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these sources: Hammurabi =Ancient=Instructions of Shuruppak.

The Board of Governors at the IAEA later notified the Security Council that North Korea was not in compliance with its obligations under the Joint Agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA.Bothe, M., Ronzitti, N. & Rosas, A.

After direct negotiations with the United States, North Korea revoked its earlier decision to withdraw from the NPT in June 1993 and weapons inspections resumed, though not under the full terms of access under the original Joint Agreement. In October 1994, the ongoing negotiations resulted in the Agreed Framework in which the DPRK agreed to the original 1992 IAEA safeguards and to freeze and dismantle its nuclear reactors and other facilities under the supervision of the IAEA in exchange for light water reactors.Kapur (2007), p. 156 See also List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 801 to 900 (1993‚Äì1994) * United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 * North Korea and weapons of mass destruction References  External links  *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 0825 Category:Nuclear program of North Korea 0825 0825 Category:May 1993 events Category:1993 in North Korea ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 825"},{"id":"5979544","text":"Horatio Nelson Wells (November 4, 1808 - August 8, 1858) was an American lawyer and Wisconsin politician.

He was the son of John IV and Sichelgaita, sister of Sergius IV of Naples. He was either very young (an infant) when he succeeded his father or perhaps he was even born posthumously. His regency was disputed by Leo, his father's brother, and the senatrix Emilia, his father's mother. From 1014 to 1024, Leo acted as co-duke, but then he retired to Itri and left the regency to Emilia (1025). In 1027, John gave refuge to Sergius IV, who had been forced out of Naples. The two of them together plotted his retaking of Naples and recruited Ranulf Drengot, a Norman mercenary, to their cause. Later, when Ranulf had realigned himself with Pandulf IV of Capua, Sergius and John's old enemy and the old captor of Naples, John was threatened by the new Lombard-Norman alliance. In 1032, Pandulf conquered Gaeta and John went into hiding, where he continued to harass Pandulf and tried to control his territories without his capital. He died around 1040.

Football career Jeannin began his career at local club Troyes, where he mainly played for the reserves in the fifth tier of French football. He made two first team appearances in Ligue 2 during the 1997-98 season. He then moved to Racing Club Paris where he played in the Championnat National He started playing in England in the 2000-01 season when Darlington signed him from Troyes AC. However midway through the following season his contract was terminated. His next spell in English football was with Exeter City where he spent two seasons and was part of the team who played against Manchester United in the FA Cup before being released at the tail end of the 2004-05 season. After a very brief spell with Bristol Rovers where he played just one game, he joined Hereford United. In Jeannin's first season at Hereford he started 52 matches, missing only 5, and scored 3 goals in all competitions, one notably on his 28th birthday when he scored a free-kick against one of his former clubs Exeter City, a moment that was televised live. He became quickly a fans' favorite. However his second season with the Bulls was less successful. After being named Player of the Month for November, and scoring against Torquay United, he was suddenly dropped after the away match at Shrewsbury Town. Thereafter he was overlooked from the starting XI for all first team matches for the rest of the season, he did come on as a sub for the injured Mkandawire away at Wycombe Wanderers; although he was the only recognised defender on the bench. On 30 April 2007 it was announced that he had left Hereford by mutual consent. Jeannin also managed to hit the crossbar when Hereford participated in Soccer AM's Crossbar Challenge. In January 2008, he joined Kidderminster Harriers on loan for three months.Patterson signs trio of new faces, BBC Sport He joined Mansfield Town in August 2008 where he managed to play 31 games.

The western terminus of the route is at Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 5 in the neighborhood of Dock Junction. The eastern terminus is at Interstate 90 and Pennsylvania Route 430 southeast of downtown in Harborcreek Township. Route description Southbound Bayfront Connector at 38th Street. PA 290 officially begins at I-79 exit 183, less than a quarter of a mile from where I-79 terminates at the Bayfront Parkway. After exiting the off-ramps, PA 290 embarks on a concurrency with PA 5 eastward through downtown Erie on 12th Street, passing south of Louis J. Tullio Arena and UPMC Park in the heart of downtown. At the Bayfront Connector, an extension of the Bayfront Parkway that opened on June 17, 2005,Behrend welcomes completed Bayfront Connector PA 290 breaks from PA 5 and turns to the east onto the Connector. As part of the Bayfront Connector, PA 290 interchanges with U.S. Route 20 a mile from PA 5 prior to following the Connector out of the city. Roughly a mile northwest of I-90, the Connector passes north of Penn State Behrend and merges into PA 430, creating a concurrency between PA 290 and PA 430. The two routes remain conjoined to I-90 exit 32, where PA 290 terminates on the southeast side of the interchange.  History  The highway was formed in order to create a high-speed loop for traffic between I-90 and I-79, which begins at the end of the Bayfront Parkway, as well as to help promote the 12th Street corridor as a viable alternate route to the congested Bayfront Parkway. Major intersections Bayfront Connector The Bayfront Connector is a , four-lane expressway that connects Interstate 90 to downtown Erie, Pennsylvania; it is continuous with Route 290 throughout its length. At the intersection of East 12th Street, the Bayfront Parkway becomes the Bayfront Connector and picks up the concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 290. After it bridges the railroad tracks owned by CSX, the Connector parallels the tracks for Norfolk Southern. The Connector intersects East 38th Street at angle, prohibiting turns onto 38th Street. After the intersection of Shannon Road, the Bayfront Connector stops paralleling railroad tracks and crosses Fourmile Creek over the Wintergreen Gorge Bridge. The concurrency for Pennsylvania Route 430 begins at the intersection with Station Road. The entrance to Penn State Erie is on the Connector at the intersection for Hannon Road and Knowledge Parkway. The Bayfront Connector terminates, along with PA 290, at the I-90 interchange, while PA 430 continues as Station Road. See also *  Notes  :a. PennDOT lists the official meausurement of the Bayfront Connector as long.

It is in the western section of Toronto, formerly the city of Etobicoke. It is bounded by the Etobicoke Creek to the west, the Gardiner Expressway to the north, the CPR railway to the east and the CNR railway to the south. Alderwood is named after Etobicoke, the municipality of which it originally was a part, which is a native word meaning \\"place where the alder trees grow.\\" History With Long Branch, Alderwood was originally part of Col Sam Smith's land. In 1850, Archibald Cameron purchased four farm lots of this land comprising most of the area that is now Alderwood; he built his home 'Ashfield' on what is now Beta Street. In 1874 Archibald Cameron was facing bankruptcy and sold his farm lots to Daniel Horner, who later served as a prominent member of Etobicoke Township's Council; Horner Avenue is named after him. The naming of Alderwood's main street was a hotly debated issue in the early community between the Brown and O'Connor families; today it is called Brown's Line. ;Alderwood Subdivided About 1920 what is now Alderwood was first planned as an extension of the newly incorporated Town of New Toronto and was originally called 'New Toronto Heights' or 'New Toronto Park ' with the first streets planned in a simple grid pattern with names from the Greek alphabet (Beta, Gamma, Delta). Alderwood was still part of the original Etobicoke township. In 1933 Alderwood became a postal village remaining in Etobicoke Township although closely connected to the independent municipalities Long Branch and New Toronto to the south, but separated by the railway. Although Alderwood did not undergo significant growth until after the Second World War, many industries moved into the area along Brown's Line during the war years. Alderwood was further disconnected from the rest of Etobicoke Township to the north by the construction of the Queen Elizabeth Way in the 1930s and the industrialisation of much of Etobicoke immediately to the north which cemented Alderwood's closer attachment to the independent municipalities of Long Branch and New Toronto to the south. After the war, increased immigration, particularly from eastern Europe, led to the rapid urbanisation of the area which continued until the end of the 1960s. ;Modern Alderwood In 1967 the independent municipalities formed out of Etobicoke Township were re- amalgamated with Etobicoke to create the Borough of Etobicoke which became a city in 1983. In 1998 the City of Etobicoke was merged with six other cities and the Metropolitan Toronto government to form an amalgamated City of Toronto. With Alderwood remaining an area with only little commercial space and low-rise single homes, the neighbourhood experienced population stagnation and decline as the children of older residents moved out, forcing the Public School Board to close Franklin Horner Middle School and Alderwood Collegiate. Alderwood Collegiate became a Separate (Catholic) High School, 'Fr John Redmond' which has recently moved from the dilapidated site to a new home in New Toronto. The area has most recently been at the centre of a debate over historic preservation as the Horner's 'Ashfield' home at the centre of the community was demolished. Character The Alderwood branch of the Toronto Public Library is located on Horner Avenue. Alderwood is characterized by single family homes, many of which were constructed at the end of the Second World War. Schools in the neighbourhood include √âcole Sir Adam Beck Junior School and Lanor Junior Middle School. The neighbourhood was formerly served by a high school (Alderwood Collegiate Institute, later Father John Redmond Secondary School), but the school is vacant today. Another closed school, Franklin Horner Junior Middle School, is home to the Franklin Horner Community Centre. The Alderwood Centre is a public complex that houses Sir Adam Beck Junior School, the Alderwood branch of the Toronto Public Library system, the Alderwood Action After School child care centre and the Alderwood Pool, a 25-yard public pool, and is adjacent to an outdoor hockey rink. The south east quadrant of the neighbourhood is zoned industrial and is home to manufacturing and warehousing businesses of various sizes. Among these is a Daimler-Chrysler casting plant.

Franklin Horner Middle School was built on land donated by the Horner family for children. Later called Franklin Horner Middle School, it closed in 1984 due to a decline in student enrolment. * The first public high school in the Alderwood area, built on Valermo Drive was Alderwood Collegiate Institute. It opened September 6, 1955, with the official opening ceremony November 1955. The school closed in June 1983, and was later occupied by Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School, which has since moved to the former 'Lakeshore Asylum' grounds in New Toronto. Alderwood Collegiate Institute has had a third life in the entertainment industry as the set the mid-1980s CBC children's series The Edison Twins and again in 2010 as the set for the Steven Spielberg television series Falling Skies.

She specialized in large dramatic roles such as Isolde, Br√ºnnhilde, and particularly Kundry, and is considered, along with Astrid Varnay and Birgit Nilsson, one of the three major postwar Wagner sopranos. She was among the preeminent Wagner sopranos‚Äîand most compelling singing actresses‚Äîof the twentieth century.Obituary, theguardian.com, 20 December 2001; accessed 8 September 2015. She was celebrated for her highly individualized interpretations, exceptional acting ability, intense stage presence, and \\"rich, sexy voice.\\"Obituary, telegraph.co.uk; accessed 8 September 2015. Her career peaked in the early and mid-1950s, which included her Br√ºnnhilde in Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler's famous 1954 studio recording of Die Walk√ºre and his 1953 live recording of Der Ring des Nibelungen (his only uncut recording of the cycle), along with the title role from Fidelio with the same conductor also in 1953 (at first live and then in studio), and Isolde in Herbert von Karajan's 1952 Tristan und Isolde, live from Bayreuth. There have been fully ten recordings of her Kundry released commercially, most associated with the Bayreuth Festival, all from 1949‚Äì59. Although she is most known for her portrayals of Wagner's major heroines from 1951‚Äì55, her continuous performing career (as mezzo-soprano after the 1950s) lasted in excess of half a century, well into the singer's eighties, through which her acting abilities remained intact. Career M√∂dl spent much of her early life as a bookkeeper and secretary in Nuremberg. At the age of 28, she began vocal studies at the Conservatory of her home town.Blyth A., Martha M√∂dl obituary. Opera, March 2002, pp. 311‚Äì13. Having made her debut as H√§nsel in Remscheid in 1942, she then added Cherubino, Mignon and Azucena to her roles. Moving to D√ºsseldorf, she began performing Dorabella, Venus, Octavian, Eboli, Carmen and Klytemnestra. She was then invited to perform in Carmen at Covent Garden in 1949 (returning for the Ring in 1959, Klytemnestra in 1966 and Die schweigsame Frau in 1972, and joined the Hamburg State Opera in the same year. In 1950, she made her La Scala debut as Kundry. Her Venus in Hamburg was noticed by Wieland Wagner, and she was invited to play the role of Kundry at Bayreuth in 1951, becoming part of a group of singers called the \\"New Bayreuth,\\" often sharing roles with Astrid Varnay. She went on to perform Isolde in 1952 in an account with Herbert von Karajan and Ramon Vinay that, along with Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler's account of the same year, are considered definitive. A second recording of her Isolde exists from 1959 with Ferdinand Leitner. She joined the Stuttgart Opera, and would reprise the role of Isolde on TV when Leonard Bernstein presented his \\"What Makes Opera Grand?\\" segment on Omnibus. Her Fidelio with Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler from 1953 (which was recorded live before ultimately being recorded in the studio) is definitive, though she also recorded the role with Karajan, and went on to open the Wiener Staatsoper with it in 1955 under Karl B√∂hm. She performed as Kundry and Br√ºnnhilde at the Metropolitan between 1956‚Äì60. Her early career saw three Verdi roles: Lady Macbeth in Macbeth with Joseph Keilberth at the Berlin Staatsoper (1951), the contralto role Ulrica in Un Ballo in Maschera (1951, 1966), and Preziosilla in La Forza del Destino (1952).Profile, operadis-opera-discography.org.uk; accessed 8 September 2015. Three essentially complete recordings of her Br√ºnnhilde (all three live) have been published: the 1953 and 1955 Ring cycles conducted by Joseph Keilberth, and the 1953 Rome Ring cycle under Furtw√§ngler. The Rome Cycle is frequently cited as being among the best cycles ever recorded, combining the century's leading Wagnerian conductor with an all-star cast and decent sound. (Furtw√§ngler very pointedly passed over the more-famous Varnay for M√∂dl as the female lead.) The 1955 cycle's Siegfried has not been released, though Br√ºnnhilde appears only for that opera's final duet. The Walk√ºre from this production, along with Keilberth's Walk√ºre from 1954 (discussed below), represent the two occasions on which M√∂dl and her great contemporary Astrid Varnay sang the two leading women opposite one another; in this case, M√∂dl was Br√ºnnhilde. Kundry, however, was to be her defining role, singing it at every Bayreuth production from 1951‚Äì59 except for 1958, most famously in 1951, the year the festival re-opened, under Knappertsbusch, and in 1953, under Clemens Krauss. Furtw√§ngler had engaged her to sing Br√ºnnhilde for his studio recording of the Ring, of which, due to his death in 1954, only Die Walk√ºre was ever recorded. The conductor commented: \\"Other singers can sing what they like; you'll always recognise them. With Martha M√∂dl, her voice identifies so closely with the role that you are only aware of the character on stage.\\" She sang the role of Sieglinde only once - at the Bayreuth Festival in 1954 under Keilberth. This was the only time she ever performed Sieglinde (she later called it a mistake). She and Birgit Nilsson share the distinction of each performing the role just once at Bayreuth (Nilsson sang it at the Festival in 1957 under Knappertsbusch), however M√∂dl sang this role literally only once (i.e. in one spectacle), whereas Nilsson sang it in both 1957 spectacles. This 1954 Ring Cycle (of which only Die Walk√ºre has been released) is the only time the three major postwar Wagner sopranos were recorded together‚ÄîVarnay as Br√ºnnhilde, M√∂dl as Sieglinde, and Nilsson as Ortlinde (one of the Walk√ºre sisters). It is also one of only two times Max Lorenz sang at Bayreuth after World War II, and his acting abilities lend the record further interest. During the 1960s, she had difficulties with her voice from singing such heavy parts for a decade, and returned to singing mezzo-soprano repertoire, such as Klytemnestra in Elektra, the Nurse (Die Frau ohne Schatten) and Waltraute. In 1968 she appeared as Ruth in a German-language production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance, and in 1970 she appeared in The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny in Cologne. From the 1970s, M√∂dl appeared in character parts: Grandmother Buryjovka, the Countess in The Queen of Spades in Nice (1989)Report from Nice, in Opera, March 1990, p. 291. which she was still performing in Mannheim at the age of 87. In 1997, she reminisced about her career in the film Love's Debris. A book of conversations with the singer was published in 1998 entitled So war mein Weg. She appeared at several premieres: Elisabeth Tudor (Fortner, 1972), Kabale und Liebe (Von Einem, 1976), and Baal (Cerha, 1999). She never married, and lived with her mother until the latter's death in 1989. Few details about her personal life survive. A brief video from six months prior to her death survives in which she appears with another famous dramatic soprano (of younger generation), Hildegard Behrens.

It is the first novel in the first of three trilogies about Bernard Samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Berlin Game is part of the Game, Set and Match trilogy, being succeeded by Mexico Set and London Match, and followed by the Hook, Line and Sinker trilogy and the final Faith, Hope and Charity trilogy. Deighton's novel Winter (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. Plot summary The time is the early 1980s. A highly placed agent in East Germany codenamed \\"Brahms Four\\" wants to come to the West. Brahms Four is one of Britain's most reliable, most valuable agents behind the Iron Curtain, and that he should be urgently demanding safe passage to the West sends a ripple of panic through the SIS. Bernard Samson, a former field agent, and now working behind a London desk, is tasked to undertake the crucial rescue. After all, it was Brahms Four who had once, nearly twenty years ago, saved his life. But even before Samson sets out on his mission, he is confronted with undeniable evidence that there is a traitor among his colleagues working for the KGB. Clearly, it is someone close to the top, close to Samson himself. It could be Dicky Cruyer, his incompetent supervisor - whom Samson despises. It could be the American Bret Rensselaer, who has built his entire career around the work of Brahms Four ‚Äî and who is spending an inordinate amount of time with Samson's wife, Fiona (also an intelligence officer). It could be Frank Harrington, the 'rezident' (head) of the Berlin field unit. In fact, it could be any member of the senior staff at London Central ‚Äî even the Director-General himself. Bernard travels to East Berlin to assist the escape of Brahms Four, and decides at the last moment to send Brahms Four out in his place. His suspicions of treachery prove well-founded when he is captured and subsequently confronted by his wife, who had defected and betrayed the operation. Adaptations Bernard Samson was played by Ian Holm and Fiona Samson by Mel Martin in a 1988 Granada Television adaptation of the Game, Set and Match trilogy, entitled Game, Set and Match, transmitted as twelve 60 minute episodes. Filmed on location in Berlin and Mexico, the project included a large international cast with 3,000 extras and a budget of $8 million. While critically acclaimed, the ratings for the series were a disaster. It was adapted by John Howlett and directed by Ken Grieve and Patrick Lau. It has not been officially released on VHS or DVD. Other The novel contains an early promulgation of the myth that President John F. Kennedy's famous \\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\" remark actually translated to \\"I am a jam doughnut\\". In Berlin Game, the character Bernard Samson is told that he is berlinerisch: In the preface to the reprint edition, Deighton notes that the novel is told in the highly subjective voice of the character of Bernard Samson, \\"who is inclined to complain and exaggerate so that we have to interpret the world around him\\". The author adds that \\"Readers who take Bernard‚Äôs words literally are missing a lot of the intended content\\". In the prequel to the trilogy, Winter (1987), Deighton reminded his readers that the views of the characters were not necessarily those of the writer. The book's epigraph is a quote from James Jones: \\"...readers should remember that the opinions expressed by the characters are not necessarily those of the author...\\" Trivia In Quentin Tarantino's film Jackie Brown, Robert Forster's character, Max Cherry, can be seen with a copy of this novel. In Arthur Penn‚Äôs film Target, Gene Hackman‚Äôs character, Walter Lloyd/Duncan (Duke) Potter, can be seen with a copy of this novel.

Such behavior is often the result of an expectation (real or imagined) Or benefits from the political formations, often at the cost of other communities. Votebank politics is the practice of creating and maintaining votebanks through divisive policies. As it encourages voting on the basis of self-interest of certain groups, often against their better judgement, it is considered harmful to the principles of representative democracy. Etymology The term was first used by noted Indian sociologist, M. N. Srinivas (who also coined the terms Sanskritisation and dominant caste), in his 1955 paper entitled The Social System of a Mysore Village. He used it in the context of political influence exerted by a patron over a client. Later, the expression was used by F. G. Bailey, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, San Diego, in his 1959 book Politics and Social Change, to refer to the electoral influence of the caste leader. This is the usage that has since become popular. Examples Some of the first identified votebanks were along caste lines. Others based on other community characteristics, such as religion and language, have also occurred. Votebanks are generally considered undesirable in electoral politics. For example, argues that votebanks based on either caste or religion stand in the way of secularisation. identifies accusations of votebanking as a rhetorical tool used by Hindu nationalists in complaints about special rights or privileges granted to non-Hindus in India. Other examples include: *In 1989, the Badaga people of South India petitioned the Indian government to be recognized as an official tribe, demonstrating en masse on 15 May of that year to imply the strength of the Badaga votebank. *India's Left Front party historically has solid support in rural West Bengal.

Biography German American Rinehart was born in Lodi (now Maple Park), Illinois. He and his brother, Alfred, moved to Colorado in the 1870s and found employment at the Charles Bohm photography studio, in Denver. In 1881 the Rinehart brothers formed a partnership with famous Western photographer William Henry Jackson, who had achieved widespread fame for his images of the West. Under Jackson's teachings, Rinehart's perfected his professional skills, and developed a keen interest in Native American culture. Frank Rinehart and Anna, the receptionist of Jackson's studio, married and in 1885 moved to Nebraska. In downtown Omaha, Rinehart opened a studio in the Brandeis Building, where he worked until his death. Rinehart married Anna Ransom Johnson (daughter of Willard Bemis Johnson and Phebe Jane Carpenter) on 5 September 1885 in Denver County, Colorado. They had two daughters, Ruth and Helen, both born in Nebraska. In 1898, and in occasion of the Indian Congress held in conjunction with the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, Rinehart was commissioned to photograph the event and the Native American personalities who attended it.see Westward the Empire site, Indian Congress section Together with his assistant Adolph Muhr (who would later be employed by the famous photographer Edward S. Curtis), they produced what is now considered \\"one of the best photographic documentations of Indian leaders at the turn of the century\\".excerpted from the Kansas City Area Archivists Tom Southall, former photograph curator at the University of Kansas' Spencer Art Museum, said of the Rinehart collection: Rinehart and Muhr photographed American Indians at the Indian Congress in a studio on the Exposition grounds with an 8 x 10 glass-negative camera with a German lens. Platinum prints were produced to achieve the broad range of tonal values that medium afforded.From the U.S. department of Interior Museum online gallery of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition After the Indian Congress, Rinehart and Muhr travelled the Indian reservations for two years, portraying Native American leaders who had not attended the event, as well as depicting general aspects of the indigenous everyday life and culture. The collection of Rinehart Indian Photographs is currently preserved at Haskell Indian Nations University. Since 1994, the collection has been organized, preserved, copied, and cataloged in a computer database, funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Hallmark Foundation. It includes images from the 1898 Exposition, the 1899 Greater America Exposition, studio portraits from 1900, and photographs by Rinehart taken at the Crow Agency in Montana also in 1900.

It is one of the official state foods of Louisiana.Laws of Louisiana, LL 170.9, 2003. Ingredients Ingredients include ground beef, ground pork, onions, peppers, garlic, oil, and a pie shell. Natchitoches meat pies are often fried in peanut oil because of that oil's high smoking temperature. A number of restaurants in the historic district in Natchitoches serve meat pies, and frozen pies are available from grocers in northern Louisiana. It has a savory meat filling in a crescent-shaped, flaky wheat pastry turnover. It is similar to a Spanish picadillo beef empanada. Varieties are found throughout the colonies of the Spanish Empire. The Natchitoches meat pie is nearly identical to the traditional ground beef empanada of Argentina, Empanada de Carne. The meat pie is found all throughout Louisiana, including southern Louisiana which tends to have a spicier version compared to its northern counterpart, but its origins are found to be from Northern Louisiana. Although found in Greater New Orleans today, The Picayune's Creole Cook Book published in 1901 by The Times Picayune of New Orleans does not contain a recipe for a Natchitoches style meat pie in its list of over 1,000 recipes. Natchitoches meat pies are found in other parts of Southern Louisiana as well as sold at food booths at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and seems to have spread south from Northern Louisiana. The use of wheat flour as an ingredient is significant. Corn is grown locally. It is a staple of both Spanish and Native American food. Wheat is difficult to grow in this wet, warm climate. Mexican wheat flour could have been imported initially by annual supply convoy over El Camino Real de los Tejas (a portion later became The Old San Antonio Road) or sourced from Europe via the French port on the Red River at Natchitoches. Modern recipe In the modern recipe, ground pork or pork sausage is blended into the ground beef for additional flavor. Onions, bell pepper and when used garlic and parsley provide aromatics. Ground black pepper and cayenne pepper are added to get attention without being uncomfortable. Flour is added to the browned meat and vegetable mixture to dry, thicken and loosely bind the filling. The meat filling can be used in other foods (e.g., tacos, tamales, enchiladas, stuffed bell pepper et al) but the wheat turnover crust is a defining element. The traditional size is approximately 4 ounces (by weight) on a 5\\"-6\\" diameter pastry dough (with the dough circles being cut, traditionally, using an empty coffee can). The filling should be made the day before to allow the flavors of the ingredients to meld. Filling, dough and tools should be chilled before assembly. Warm filling will cause the dough to disintegrate. In the first part of the 20th century, meat pies were sold from home kitchens or from carts by street vendors. By 1967, Natchitoches meat pies were produced in commercial kitchens. Now, they may be ordered online. Louisiana Public Broadcasting aired a program January 20, 2007, describing how to make Natchitoches meat pies. It is available on DVD entitled \\"A Taste of Louisiana with Chef John Folse & Company: Our Food Heritage - The Spanish Shows\\". An annual Meat Pie Festival, held in September, celebrates the Natchitoches meat pie. It includes pie making demonstrations, a meat pie cook- off, live music and more.

He has worked with a variety of pop and jazz performers, prominently with iconoclastic pianist Cecil Taylor in the 1950s and '60s. Biography Neidlinger was born in New York City to the former Jane Buell and Roger Nidlinger. He was raised in Westport, Connecticut, where his father ran a cargo shipping business.

The Moorish Orthodox Church of America is a syncretic, non-exclusive, and religious anarchist movement espousing a vast array of liturgical and devotional traditions laid over a theology that includes teachings gleaned from Moorish Science, the Five Percenters, the Episcopi vagantes movement, Nizari Islam, Sufism (particularly from the Sufi Order InƒÅyati, Shadhili, Alevi-Bektashi and Uwaisi traditions), and varying degrees of Theosophical mysticism, Hermeticism, Oriental Orthodoxy, the League for Spiritual Discovery, Western esotericism, Neoplatonism, the teachings of Noel Ignatiev, Tantra, Zoroastrianism, Taoism, and Vedanta teachings. History and development A lineage group of the Moorish Science Temple of America, the Moorish Orthodox Church was founded in New York City in 1962 primarily by Warren Tartaglia, beatniks, spiritual seekers, anarchists and members of the Noble Order of Moorish Sufis (a group that grew out of the Moorish Science Temple #13 in Baltimore on July 7, 1957). The Moorish Orthodox Church of America published a journal entitled the Moorish Science Monitor from 1965-1967, which has been revived at times over the next few decades. Moorish Orthodoxy was founded to explore the more esoteric dimensions of Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science teachings, but quickly developed into a movement of spiritual exploration beyond its intended purpose, though it maintains Moorish Science as its core. After a long period of quiescence, the Moorish Orthodox Church of America experienced a small renaissance in the mid-1980s owing to the involvement of former members of the beat/beatnik movement, the counter- cultural hippie community, and the gay liberation movement, along with the continued involvement of Sultan Rafi Sharif Bey (who founded the Moorish League) and the prolific writings of Hakim Bey.

In March 2006, Dr. Ghoneim, together with Farouk El-Baz, discovered the Kebira Crater, a possible impact crater (astrobleme) in the Sahara. In 2007, while processing microwave space data (radar imagery), she discovered an ancient Mega-Lake (30,750 km¬≤) buried beneath the sand of the Great Sahara in Northern Darfur, Sudan. Career and research Eman Ghoneim graduated with an honor degree and received her master's degree from the Geography Department at Tanta University, Egypt in 1997. She was awarded her Ph.D. degree in Geography from the Geography Department at the University of Southampton, UK in 2002. In 2003, she held a postdoctoral position at the Center for Remote Sensing, Boston University, United States. It was during this time that she helped discover the Kebira Crater. In 2010, she joined the Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) and became the director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab (SDRS). Satellite image of the Kebira Crater She has a primary focus on the application of geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (including multispectral, thermal and microwave radar imagery), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the use of hydrologic modeling in flash flood hazard, sea level rise, drought and groundwater exploration in arid and coastal environments. Ghoneim is an expert in image processing and uses a wide array of satellite/space data including multi-spectral, hyper-spectral, thermal infrared (TIR), microwave (radar images) and digital elevation model (DEM). Ghoneim has published more than 27 peer-reviewed papers. She has published more than 48 conference articles and delivered a number of workshops, seminar lectures and training courses for multidisciplinary delegates. Ghomein was invited as an expert in her field, along with 30 other Egyptian expatriate women, to participate in the Taa Marbouta conference in 2017. The conference, which focused on the importance of Egyptian women in social, political and economic fields, was organised by the Ministry of Immigration and Egyptian Expatriates‚Äô Affairs and the National Council for Women.

The physical characteristics of this order include well separated lateral plates, which expose the oral surface of radial ossicles. It also has vertebrae with streptospondylous (hourglass) articulation, which thus allow for vertical and horizontal movements. The order has neither oral nor radial shields. They have paired serial gonads arranged segmentally along the arm. The hyponeural groove is covered by soft integument, which forms a spacious epineural canal that is not closed over by ventral arm plates. The disk is covered by naked or granulated skin, or by imbricating scales. The Oegophiurida are extinct except for a recent species, Ophiocanops fugiens, which has several remarkable features. In each arm is a single digestive caecum. The caecum wall has many folds which enlarge the absorbing surface. This is similar to the structure in asteroids. Nothing, however, is known of this species' microscopic gut structure. Its gonads also stretch into the arms, also common to asteroids. Both of these are hardly present in other orders of the class. The skeleton is similar to other ophiuroids, except the paired right and left vertebrae are not fused, albeit set in orderly fashion. Also absent are ventral arm plates and radial and oral shields. Previously, the Oegophiurida were known only to exist from the lower Ordovician to the upper Carboniferous periods. However, most features of O. fugiens conform to this order, such as the absence of genital plates and genital bursae. They also lack dorsal or ventral arm plates. However, some recent studies have challenged the classification of O. fugiens as oegophiurid.Pawson,D.L.,Phylum Echinodermata, Zootaxa 1668: 749‚Äì764 (2007) References Category:Ophiuroidea ","title":"Oegophiurida"},{"id":"5979933","text":"Humber Summit is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of the northernmost neighbourhoods in Toronto, located in the North York district of the city. It is bounded by Steeles Avenue to the north, Highway 400 to the east, Finch Avenue to the south, and follows the Humber River (east branch) to the west. History Humber Summit in 1930. In the 1840s, Humber Summit began as a pioneer community, centred on the grist and saw mills. However, as the city boundaries crept closer, the area evolved into a resort community, called Riverbend Park. In 1953, the area, along with the rest of North York, was severed from York County, joining other municipalities south of Steeles Avenue to form the regional government of Metropolitan Toronto. It became home to many Toronto residents who built cottages on the banks of the Humber River. When Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto in 1954, many of the cottages were swept away by the overflowing river. In 1998, the neighbourhood was amalgamated into the new City of Toronto. Today, Humber Summit is a middle class community. It contains a significant, well-established Italian community, but has also become the home for new East Indian and Asian families. The residences are generally semi-detached backsplits with built-in garages. Adding to the character of the suburban post-World War II 1960s homes are front porches decorated with cast-iron railings, and elaborate front archways. Education Two public school boards operate schools in Humber Summit, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Both TCDSB and TDSB operate public elementary and middle schools in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates St. Roch Catholic School on Duncanwoods Drive, and Venerable John Merlini Catholic School on Whitfield Avenue. TDSB operates two institutions that provide primary education, Gracedale Public School on Gracedale Boulevard, and Humber Summit Middle School, formerly G.B. Warren Junior High School on Pearldale Avenue. Previously, TCDSB operated St. Gaspar Catholic School on Plunkett Drive that opened in 1972 and closed in 2002, with the building demolished as of 2018. Neither school board operate a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with TDSB secondary school students residing in Humber Summit attending institutions in adjacent neighbourhoods. The French first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Humber Summit, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood.

The Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division manages a number of municipal parks in Humber Summit, including Apted Park, Gracedale Park, and Rowntree Mill Park. The latter park is situated near the Humber Valley. The Humber Valley forms a part of the Toronto ravine system. The Humber Summit branch of the Toronto Public Library (TPL) located at 2990 Islington Avenue. The library was opened by predecessor of TPL, the North York Public Library Board, on 15 May 1974. It was the first branch in North York to be in a shared facility with another community agency (the North York Parks and Recreation Department.) Transportation Several major roadways pass through the neighbourhood, including Finch Avenue, Steeles Avenue, Weston Road, and Highway 400, a major north-south controlled access highway that connects the northern areas of Greater Toronto with the city. Steeles Avenue serves as Humber Summit's northern boundary, whereas Finch Avenue serves as the city's southern boundary.

It combines the psychological thriller and the classic horror genres, making references to Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula at several points and sometimes replicating its storyline. Plot summary Ben Mears, a successful writer who grew up in the (fictional) town of Jerusalem's Lot, Maine (known to locals as \\"Salem's Lot\\" or \\"The Lot\\"), has returned home following the death of his wife. Ben plans to write a book about the \\"Marsten House\\", an abandoned mansion that gave him nightmares after a traumatic (and possibly supernatural) childhood experience. Once in town, he meets local high school teacher Matt Burke and strikes up a romantic relationship with Susan Norton, a young college graduate. Mears discovers that the Marsten house has been bought by Mr. Straker and Mr. Barlow, a pair of businessmen who are also new to the town, although only Straker has been seen. Their arrival coincides with the disappearance of a young boy, Ralphie Glick, and the suspicious death of his brother Danny. It then becomes clear that Barlow is a vampire, and is taking over the town with Straker's help. Ben, Matt, Susan, and a few other residents of the Lot try to prevent the vampires from spreading. In the end, Ben and young Mark Petrie succeed in neutralizing Straker and destroy the master vampire Barlow, but, lucky to escape with their lives, are forced to leave the town to the newly created vampires.

Humbermede, like many of the \\"Humber\\" neighbourhoods in the city, gets its name from the Humber River. It is bounded on the west by the Humber River, on the north by Finch Avenue West, on the east by the Highway 400 and on the south by Sheppard Avenue West. History Several high-rises were built near Finch Avenue and Weston Road. A farming hamlet developed by 1870 at the crossroads of Finch Avenue and Weston Road, named Dayton. A Dayton railway station at Finch Avenue and a Dayton post office were opened around that time. It was changed to Emery. One reason suggested for the change was to avoid confusion with Dayton, Ohio. By 1960, the area started being converted to urban uses, as part of North York. The neighbourhood has since developed into a suburban low-density neighbourhood primarily consisting of semi-detached homes, although some high-rises on the southwest corner of Finch and Weston Road were also built. On the south-east corner is site of the former Finch West Mall. There is an industrial area along the rail lines, extending east to Highway 400.

However the prisoners have discovered that they will be sent to other camps once the finds run out, so they arrange to keep \\"discovering\\" the same pieces. While Hecht is content to sit out the war, the SS Commandant of the nearby town, Major Volkmann, brutally enforces discipline, including reprisal executions of civilians. Resistance to the Germans is led by Zeno, a former monk, and his few fighters. They use the local brothel, run by his girlfriend, as an undercover headquarters. Zeno, who is in contact with Allied Headquarters, is ordered to break the prisoners out of their camp and use them to help liberate the town and capture the nearby U-boat refuelling depot. Two captured USO artists, Charlie and Dottie, perform a concert as cover, while the Resistance takes over the camp. With the choice of being killed by Zeno or helping them, Hecht joins forces with the Allies, helping them eradicate Volkmann's troops as well as capturing the fuel depot. After completing the mission, Charlie asks Zeno to lead him and two other prisoners, Judson and Rotelli, up to the monastery on Mount Athena to steal Byzantine treasures kept there by the monks. However Zeno tells Charlie that the treasures belong to the Greek people. Zeno now receives word from Allied intelligence that the planned invasion of the islands has been brought forward, and so the German garrison in the monastery atop Mount Athena must be neutralised. Without revealing the whole truth, Zeno tells Charlie, Rotelli and Judson that in return for helping liberate the monks from the Germans, whatever they find there would be theirs. However, on climbing to the monastery, the group discover a heavily armed garrison. Zeno uses gas to knock out most of the soldiers, but not before their commander orders a V-2 rocket launch to destroy the invasion fleet. Judson knocks out the control room with grenades, but one of the Germans survives long enough to activate the base's self-destruct mechanism. Not realising the danger immediately, Charlie and Rotelli scour the monastery for the treasure, while Judson frees the monks. Zeno finds the self-destruct clock, but he cannot deactivate it. Zeno, the monks and the Americans escape the monastery before it explodes. Searching for treasure until the last minute, Charlie escapes the explosion with the only treasure the Germans left behind ‚Äî tin plates adorned with Hitler's face. During the victory celebration in the village, Hecht, Charlie, and Dottie plan after the war to capitalise on treasures Hecht has already looted, by making copies to sell to Americans. Professor Blake learns from one of the freed monks that their treasure ‚Äî Byzantine plates made of gold ‚Äî is safe, having been hidden in the brothel the entire time. The final scene cuts to the modern day, by which time Zeno's former headquarters have been turned into a state museum housing the treasures of Mount Athena.

The film was financed by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment, who had previously made The Eagle Has Landed. That was produced by the team of David Niven Jr and Jack Wiener, and had been successful, so ITC agreed to finance two more films from the same team, Escape to Athena and Green Ice. Grade gave the job of directing to George Costmatos who had just made The Cassandra Crossing for ITC and who Grade felt \\"would make a great action movie and as \\"action\\" was in vogue again I was confident we were on to a winner.\\" In October 1977 ITC announced what was then known as The Athena Boodle as part of a $97 million slate of movies Lew Grade was making which also included The Legend of the Lone Ranger, Movie Movie (then called Double Feature), The Boys from Brazil, Raise the Titanic, The Golden Gate from the Alistair MacLean novel (never made), Love and Bullets, The Muppet Movie and Road to the Fountain of Youth with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope (which was never made). Grade's first five films had been made in partnership with General Cinema Corp, but Grade would finance this slate himself.FILM CLIPS: Lew Grade's $97 Million Projects Kilday, Gregg.

Los Angeles Times 25 Apr 1978: f8., According to stuntman Vic Armstrong, the crew hated the director so much they stole his hat and nailed it to a mast. Armstrong directed the motorcycle chase which he says took two weeks. Reception Producer Jack Wiener said during the shoot that the film cost $10 million and needed to make $30 million at the box office to recoup its cost. The film was partly financed and produced by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment. Grade had wanted an action film and felt it \\"did not live up to expectations of the script\\" turning out to be \\"a broad comedy with action- adventure sequences and the combination just didn't work.\\" Grade thought \\"\\"the first eighty minutes were a failure because of these different elements but the last forty, action-packed minutes were wonderful. If only the emphasis had been on action throughout the film would have been a hit. Unfortunately it wasn't. Still, with the pre-sales I'd made we didn't lose nearly as much as we might have\\". David Niven Jr said \\"we had a lot of fun on that picture, I just wish it had been more successful.\\" According to a number of sources, this film's motorcycle chase scene is, as one critic said, \\"one of the most memorable motorcycle chase scenes in cinematic history\\". Another says: \\"Film is an uneven mix of comedy and military action, but includes a stand out motorcycle chase. During a battle with the resistance, SS Major Volkmann escapes on a motorcycle with Charlie (played by Elliott Gould) chasing after him on a motorcycle with sidecar down narrow village streets. Impressive motorcycle stuntwork featuring some excellent jumps\\". Author Mark Hinchliff of Motorbike Writer ranks the chase in Escape to Athena as 3rd, only after those in The Great Escape (1st) and Skyfall (2nd).

When she was five years old, Elizabeth was adopted by her wealthy and childless uncle Joseph Jeffries, who had made his fortune as a butcher in Central London.http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng249.htm. Jeffries sexually violated his niece when she was fifteen. He had willed her everything he owned but hypocritically continually threatened to write her out of the will because of her immoral behaviour. Murder Elizabeth started an affair with her uncle's man-servant, John Swan. When it seemed increasingly likely that her uncle would carry out his threat regarding the will, she and Swan plotted to kill her uncle. They paid a man named Matthews to get them a brace of pistols. Matthews saw Elizabeth and John in the house on the night of the murder on 3 July 1751, and learned what they intended to do, but John made him swear not to tell anyone. She and John then went upstairs and killed her uncle. They made it seem as though her uncle had been the victim of a botched robbery and raised the alarm. Elizabeth was arrested; however, she was released when no evidence could be found. The police then began a search for Matthews, whom she had implicated. He was located and told the police everything he knew. She and John were imprisoned to await trial. Trial and execution The trial of Jeffries and Swan began eight months later, on 10 March 1752. She and John were swiftly convicted and sentenced to hang. On 28 March she was taken to the gallows in a cart and riding on her own coffin, while John was dragged on a sledge for committing alleged petty treason. When they reached the gallows, Swan was forced to stand on the cart while Jeffries, being tall, had to stand on a chair on the cart. Their legs were not tied and they were not blindfolded. A crowd of 7,000 people gathered to watch them hang. Neither Elizabeth nor John acknowledged one another, while the hangman cracked his whip and drove the cart out from under them. John died in less than five minutes. Elizabeth, however, being lighter than Swan, took over fifteen minutes to die, struggling to the end.

The northern terminus is at U.S. Route 19 near Erie. The southern terminus is at US 6 and US 19 in Cambridge Springs. Along its routing, PA 99 is known as Interchange Road, Edinboro Road, Main Street, Forest Street, Erie Street, Meadville Street, and McClellan Street. It previously shared an official SR designation with Interstate 99 but was changed in 2008 to be officially SR 0699. Route description PA 99 begins at an intersection with US 6/US 19 near the northern edge of the borough of Cambridge Springs. The route heads northwest, crossing Conneauttee Creek at Drakes Mills midway between Cambridge Springs and the Crawford-Erie county line. North of the county line, PA 99 crosses the creek once more and follows the waterway into the borough of Edinboro. Within the borough, PA 99 passes by Edinboro University of Pennsylvania south of an intersection with U.S. Route 6N in the center of the borough. The route continues northward, following the eastern edge of Edinboro Lake for a short distance. Near McKean, PA 99 begins to parallel Interstate 79 as both roadways approach the city of Erie. Midway between McKean and Erie, PA 99 passes over Interstate 90 east of its interchange with I-79. Just south of the city limits in the Millcreek Township community of Kearsarge, PA 99 separates from I-79 and turns east at a T-intersection to access US 19, where PA 99 terminates. History In 1928, the PA 99 number was first assigned to what is now Pennsylvania Route 5 along the shores of Lake Erie. Along its course, the highway had two spurs in the Erie Metropolitan Area: Pennsylvania Route 199 and Pennsylvania Route 299. The current alignment from Edinboro to Kearsarge was signed as U.S. Route 19. By 1940, PA 99 was moved to its current alignment.

He has been an international spy for the WSB spy agency, and was police commissioner of Port Charles from 1983 through 1985, then again from 1988 through 1992 when he supposedly perished in an explosion in South America. When he resigned as police commissioner in 1985 he moved to Australia with his wife Holly to start anew, but returned to Port Charles when Anna and Robin needed his help for the Mr. Big caper but after he took down the mob he return to Australia to be with his wife. (Holly was presumed dead soon afterwards, so Robert ended up returning to Port Charles.) The Interim WSB Chief returned to track down agents that were killing other agents. Robert first showed up in Port Charles under suspicious circumstances, tracking Luke and Alexandria Quartermaine in search of an ugly black statue called \\"The Ice Princess\\" which in reality was a large uncut diamond that had a secret formula which could create carbonic snow, which could either help in medical procedures to fix severe burns or in the wrong hands create world mayhem. For months, Luke and Robert believed each other to be the enemy, but when Luke learned the truth about the Ice Princess offered to work with Robert to stop the insane Cassadine family who was bent on world domination. Robert was joined in Port Charles by Agent O'Reilly (Billie Hayes). a feisty older woman who kept him on his toes and unfortunately ended up being murdered by the Cassadines. Because of her death, a vengeful Robert and Luke immediately boarded the Cassadine Yacht, \\"The Titan\\", finding Laura there, and stayed out of sight until they got to the private island where Mikkos Cassadine revealed his plans to his esteemed group of guests. Robert, Luke and Laura found help from Tiffany Hill, the mistress of Victor Cassadine who wanted to stop Mikkos from going through with his evil plans. While Robert and Laura held Mikkos's guards at gunpoint, Luke confronted Mikkos which resulted with Mikkos freezing to death in his own ice chamber and Luke frantically trying to guess the code to unfreeze Port Charles. Luke succeeded, and they all returned to Port Charles as heroes, with Tiffany joining them. Luke and Robert agreed the formula and the ice machine needed to be destroyed to avoid the risk of falling into the wrong hands. Robert left the W.S.B. over disagreements over destroying the ice machine and formula, and for a while dated Tiffany, but the spark that had captured them on the island fizzled after a while. Robert was Luke's best man when he married Laura in a big ceremony in November 1981. At the wedding, Robert was reacquainted with Mikkos's vengeful widow, Helena Cassadine, who came to town to make a huge donation to General Hospital but secretly put a curse on Luke and Laura. In early 1982, Robert took up with feisty reporter Jackie Templeton (Demi Moore) who had come to town searching for her missing sister. Robert was helping Luke search for the missing Laura, and Jackie was searching for her own sister, Laura Templeton, a model whom Laura Spencer resembled. Robert and Luke were thrust into another episode of world intrigue when David Gray, the rightful heir to the throne of a fictional kingdom of Malkuth, was revealed to have arranged for Laura Spencer's disappearance in exchange for Helena's financing his coup. David Gray was killed in a sword fight with Luke, and Robert was left to console his friend when it was believed Laura had drowned at sea. Luke and Robert next became involved in an oil scam orchestrated by Holly Sutton's crime family, the Durbans, but they managed to stop them as well from succeeding in their scheme to fleece the residents of Port Charles. Robert and Holly Sutton married under strange circumstances. Holly was pregnant with the presumed dead Luke Spencer's baby and was about to be deported, so Robert stepped in and married her. She ended up miscarrying the baby, but she and Robert eventually fell in love. Jackie Templeton was upset by this turn of events and turned vindictive against Robert for jilting her. Robert had a bad relationship with his brother Mac Scorpio when he first came to town because he blamed Mac for the death of their parents. Eventually, the brothers patched up their relationship. Robert was presumed dead along with his wife, Anna Devane, in 1992. Their teenage daughter Robin Scorpio was left behind to be raised by Robert's brother Mac Scorpio. Anna Devane reappeared in 2001, but told her family Robert was dead. However, Robert resurfaced in 2006, when Port Charles was stricken with a deadly strain of encephalitis. It came out he was forced by the WSB to be incognito for 15 years as the only way to keep his families alive; he had no choice but to let them think he was dead. Robert married Anna Devane when the two were on assignment for the WSB in Italy. The two were married in secret before either character showed up in Port Charles. After Holly \\"died\\", Anna and Robert remarried in 1991. When the evil Cesar Faison kidnapped Anna, Robert left Port Charles for South America to rescue her. =2006, 2008= Both Robert and Anna turned up alive in Port Charles in 2006 much to the surprise of their daughter, Robin. During his return in 2006, Robert told Robin he was in the South Pacific trying to track a lethal dose of encephalitis. He said he quarantined a village and torched it, but two potential carriers slipped through the net: one was a chimp and the other was Luke Spencer. Robert and Robin's relationship was briefly strained due to him not telling her he was alive, but they soon became close again. When Anna returned in the summer of 2007, she explained Robert was deep undercover on a mission to recover black market alien remains. Later, at the end of the summer both Anna and Robert were assigned on a mission in the Amazon. The character then appears on the prime time spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift when he narrowly escapes a plane crashes near Port Charles. Jagger Cates rescues him and brings him to General Hospital where it is revealed he has a brain tumor. During an MRI, Patrick Drake tells Robert hat the brain tumor is the result of another tumor, and tells Robert he has colon cancer. Writer Sri Rao explained the storyline, stating \\"When I decided to bring Robert Scorpio back to Port Charles, I wanted him and Robin to come together as a family. The best way to do that would be to have Robert present with a medical condition.\\" Rao went on to explain the cultural reasons for using colon cancer as a plot point, stating \\"I chose colon cancer because it's a disease that affects so many men and women in this country ‚Äì but we don't really talk about it. [...] This is one of the cancers that can most easily be prevented if only people will get screened. Hopefully, we can raise awareness of this with our viewers.\\" Rao reached out to the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance to make sure he conveyed the story \\"authentically, responsibly and realistically\\". Robert falls into a coma, and both Mac Scorpio (John J. York) and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) make appearances on the series to support the character. York took the opportunity to speak out and raise awareness on colon cancer. While in a coma, Robert dreams of Anna, Robin, Luke Spencer, Sean Donely and Tiffany Donely in a flashback to their old life in the 1980s. He comes out of the coma on October 14, 2008 and leaves for further treatment in Europe. =2012‚Äì14= In February 2012, Robert returns to Port Charles, after receiving news Robin had died in an explosion. Robert's guilt over what he deems as his inability to protect Robin prompts him to consider suicide by jumping off of a bridge. However, a despondent Robert is found by Luke, who tells Robert Ethan Lovett is his son, in an effort to pull Robert back from the brink. Luke, along with assistance from Holly, concocts an elaborate story that Ethan had been abducted by Helena Cassadine (Ethan had actually agreed to go along with Luke's lie), prompting him to leave Port Charles with Holly to rescue \\"his\\" son. As a result of this, Anna is left to grieve for Robin on her own. Over the next several months, a burgeoning romantic relationship begins to develop between Anna and Luke, with Luke continuing to keep quiet about his lie. It is only following a trip to Switzerland, where Anna had been led to believe a very much alive Robin had been held, that Luke comes clean. An infuriated Anna then demands Luke track down Robert and admit to what he had done. Luke eventually does so off-screen, with it being implied the two men came to blows. In November 2012, Robert returns to Port Charles at the behest of Luke, who has informed him of the return of the long-presumed dead Duke Lavery. Robert, much as Luke had, suspects there is something amiss about \\"Duke's\\" return from the grave. Robert is later intrigued by word Olivia Falconeri claims to have seen a different face in a vision about Duke, and recruits Elizabeth Webber to produce a sketch of the other face. When the sketch is completed, it bears a striking similarity to Robert's long-time enemy, Cesar Faison, who is masquerading as Duke in order to get closer to Anna. It is revealed \\"Duke\\" really is Faison. Anna though still believes the real Duke is alive. Robert, John, and Anna confronts Dr. Obrecht, and then find the real Duke Lavery. Robert then finds Robin alive, but Dr. Obrecht injects him, so no one knows. Anna finds Robert unconscious, and Robert is put into a coma. Robert wakes up from his coma on October 4, 2013 and is greeted by Anna and Mac. After some initial skepticism on Anna's part, he finally convinces her he saw Robin alive just before Dr. Obrecht put him in the coma. They decide not to tell Mac in order to spare him the anguish of false hope if Robert is wrong. After Faison escapes from prison with the help of Obrecht, and Anna learns from Nikolas Cassadine that Obrecht has been to Cassadine Island, Robert and Anna decide to pursue them to Cassadine Island, hoping to find Robin still alive. Robert and Anna are held prisoner on Cassadine Island by Jerry Jacks in the same laboratory where Jerry had kept Robin. After several weeks of captivity, Robert and Anna manage to escape in November 2013. They capture Jerry and take him back to Port Charles as a prisoner. The team then goes to Spoon Island and finds Robin alive, leading to an emotional reunion. They capture Obrecht and Faison. Anna decides the only way to keep Faison out of their lives for good is to kill him. Robert is reluctant to go along at first, but in the end when he sees Anna is determined to kill Faison, he joins in her in a joint execution, saying, \\"If we do this, we'll do it together.\\" Robert covers their tracks and it remains unknown what really happened to Faison. He later announces he'll leave Port Charles to help out Holly and her son Ethan, who got himself in trouble with a scam. =2015-18= In December 2015, Robert joins Anna and Patrick to rescue Robin who is being held by Jerry Jacks again. They storm the compound where Jerry announces Robin is dead, however she actually faked her death to trick Jerry. After Robert and Anna sent Jerry to Steinmauer, they were reunited with Robin and they all went home. Robert was there for Robin and Patrick's second wedding in January 2016. Robert briefly returns to Port Charles in August to warn Luke's family about Valentin Cassadine who was already arrested and extradited to Greece. In April 2018, Robert joins Anna's search for Faison's previously unknown son Heinrik Faison in Switzerland. He was shocked to discover Heinrik was also Anna's son, but he understood why she kept it from everyone. In May, Peter August was exposed as Heinrik and Jason Morgan was going to kill him, but Anna stopped him and Peter was arrested under Robert's orders. When Peter escapes from jail, Robert leaves town to sort out the mess that was made. In July, Robert returns to Port Charles to extradite Peter to Steimauer after learning Peter has been found, but Robert later shelved the charges against Peter for Anna's sake. He later works with Hamilton Finn to rescue Anna who was kidnapped by mysterious men who wanted Finn to bring Cassandra Pierce out of her coma. Robert and Finn's half-brother, Harrison Chase rescue Finn and Anna as Cassandra is kidnapped by a mysterious Cassadine. Robert leaves town to find her. =2019= Robert returns to Port Charles in early 2019 with intel on why Anna suddenly went blind. Their search for answers leads them to Dr. Arthur Cabot who went blind as well. They restore Cabot's sight who tells them Anna and her sister Alex were part of his original study to transfer memories from one person to another. In March, Robert joins Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) in Turkey to find and rescue Sonny‚Äôs son, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) who has been on an undercover for the WSB since June 2018. After a shootout with Raj Patel and his men, Robert brings Sonny and Dante home. In April, Robert reveals the possibility to Anna that Peter may not be her son after all, but Anna decides not to pursue that theory because she wants a relationship with Peter. In June, Robert was booted out of the WSB by being forced to retire despite the fact he still has WSB contacts. He later becomes the new District Attorney for Port Charles.

By comparing ENSO episodes in different time periods and across countries, Davis explores the impact of colonialism and the introduction of capitalism, and the relation with famine in particular. Davis argues that \\"Millions died, not outside the 'modern world system', but in the very process of being forcibly incorporated into its economic and political structures. They died in the golden age of Liberal Capitalism; indeed, many were murdered ... by the theological application of the sacred principles of Smith, Bentham and Mill.\\" The book won the World History Association Book Prize in 2002.The World History Association Book Prize Past Winners Davis characterizes the Indian famines under the British Raj as \\"colonial genocide\\". Some scholars, including Niall Ferguson, have disputed this judgment, while others, including Adam Jones, have affirmed it. Overview Victims of the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 This book explores the impact of colonialism and the introduction of capitalism during the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation related famines of 1876‚Äì1878, 1896‚Äì1897, and 1899‚Äì1902, in India, China, Brazil, Ethiopia, Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and New Caledonia. It focuses on how colonialism and capitalism in British India and elsewhere increased rural poverty and hunger while economic policies exacerbated famine. The book's main conclusion is that the deaths of 30‚Äì60 million people killed in famines all over the world during the later part of the 19th century were caused by laissez-faire and Malthusian economic ideology of the colonial governments. In addition to a preface and a short section on definitions, the book is broken into four parts: The Great Drought, 1876‚Äì1878; El Ni√±o and the New Imperialism, 1888‚Äì1902; Decyphering ENSO; and The Political Ecology of Famine. \\"Davis explicitly places his historical reconstruction of these catastrophes in the tradition inaugurated by Rosa Luxemburg in The Accumulation of Capital, where she sought to expose the dependence of the economic mechanisms of capitalist expansion on the infliction of 'permanent violence' on the South\\"., : Davis argues, for example, that \\"Between 1875‚Äì1900‚Äîa period that included the worst famines in Indian history‚Äîannual grain exports increased from 3 to 10 million tons\\", equivalent to the annual nutrition of 25m people. \\"Indeed, by the turn of the century, India was supplying nearly a fifth of Britain‚Äôs wheat consumption at the cost of its own food security.\\" In addition, \\"Already saddled with a huge public debt that included reimbursing the stockholders of the East India Company and paying the costs of the 1857 revolt, India also had to finance British military supremacy in Asia. In addition to incessant proxy warfare with Russia on the Afghan frontier, the subcontinent‚Äôs masses also subsidized such far-flung adventures of the Indian Army as the occupation of Egypt, the invasion of Ethiopia, and the conquest of the Sudan. As a result, military expenditures never comprised less than 25 percent (34 percent including police) of India‚Äôs annual budget...\\" As an example of the effects of both this and of the restructuring of the local economy to suit imperial needs (in Victorian Berar, the acreage of cotton doubled 1875‚Äì1900), Davis notes that \\"During the famine of 1899‚Äì1900, when 143,000 Beraris died directly from starvation, the province exported not only thousands of bales of cotton but an incredible 747,000 bushels of grain.\\" Publication history This book was first published in Illustrated Hardcover edition in December 2000. It was later issued in paper back format in May 2002.Verso Books Publication Page An extract was published in Antipode in 2000.  Reception  This book won the World History Association Book Prize in 2002. It was also featured in the LA Times Best Books of 2001 List. In his book, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, while generally approving the historical presentation of facts, claimed that Davis' conclusions were overly reductive. In response to Davis' approval of Karl Polanyi's hypothesis that \\"Indian masses in the second half of the 19th century ... perished in large numbers because the Indian village community had been demolished\\", Sen retorts that \\"this is an enormous exaggeration. In exploding one myth, we have to be careful not to fall for another\\"; however, \\"it is an illustrative book of the disastrous consequences of fierce economic inequality combined with a drastic imbalance of political voice and power. The late-Victorian tragedies exemplify a wider problem of human insecurity and vulnerability ultimately related to economic disparity and political disempowerment. The relevance of this highly informative book goes well beyond its immediate historical focus.\\" Reviews   * See also Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 * Indian famine of 1896‚Äì97 * Indian famine of 1899‚Äì1900 * Great Famine (Ireland) * Timeline of major famines in India during British rule * Northern Chinese Famine of 1876‚Äì79 * Boxer Rebellion 1899‚Äì1900 * The Evil Empire: 101 Ways That England Ruined the World References External links \\"Who's the twerp and who writes twaddle?

Overview Sweden emerged unharmed by World War II. The Swedish non- alignment policy officially remained ‚Äì Sweden rejected NATO membership but joined the United Nations and later EFTA. Tage Erlander (s) was Prime Minister from 1946 to 1969 ‚Äì a period of exceptional economic and social prosperity, and generally low unemployment, but the housing situation posed problems as more and more people moved to the cities. Responding to the housing shortage, the government introduced the Million Programme ‚Äì a national wave of suburban development with the aim of creating a million homes from 1965 to 1974. This period saw the beginning of large-scale immigration to a country that used to be one of the more ethnically homogeneous in the world. The first phase of immigration consisted of workers from southern Europe, who were actively wooed over by campaigns of advertisement and recruitment in their home countries, for instance Italy & Austria. In the 1970s and 1980s many refugees with families arrived from e.g. Chile, Kurdistan, Vietnam & Somalia, some of them with refugee status, others on the immigration quota. At the same time, the economy was entering less powerfully prosperous times: while Sweden continues to be a thoroughly industrialized nation with many businesses of cutting-edge innovation, especially in telephonics, energy management, chemicals, pharmaceutics & food industry, this growth both in production and complication is not generating a great amount of new employment in Sweden anymore, and therefore did not swallow the generations who have grown up since 1980. On 3 September 1967, Sweden was the last country in continental Europe to introduce right-hand traffic. This was done on Dagen H, in spite of the negative result of a referendum in 1955. Swedish neutrality in the Cold War During the Cold War, Sweden maintained a dual approach, publicly the strict neutrality policy was forcefully maintained but unofficially, strong ties were kept with the U.S. and it was hoped that the U.S. would use conventional and nuclear weapons to strike at Soviet staging areas in the occupied Baltic states in case of a Soviet attack on Sweden. Over time and due to the official neutrality dogma, fewer and fewer Swedish military officials were aware of the military cooperation with the west, making such cooperation in the event of war increasingly difficult. At the same time Swedish defensive planning was completely based on help from abroad in the event of war. The fact that it was not permissible to mention this aloud eventually led to the Swedish armed forces becoming highly misbalanced. For example, a strong ability to defend against an amphibious invasion was maintained, while an ability to strike at inland staging areas was almost completely absent.Livl√∂s livlina till v√§st Framsyn 2004, Nr. 1 (The Swedish Defence Research Agency‚Äôs bi-monthly publication) The political unity among the democratic parties on the neutrality politics where total which made it possible for Sweden to rearm the military. In the 1970s and 1980s Sweden's military expenditure per capita was the highest in the world. Because of the neutrality politics most of the military equipment was produced and developed in Sweden by companies such as SAAB, Kockums, Bofors and H√§gglunds (today BAE Systems AB). Prime minister Olof Palme summarized the Swedish neutrality in a speech in 1985; Vi st√•r f√∂r Sveriges oberoende i fred och kommer med fasthet att v√§rna v√•rt territorium mot varje inkr√§ktare (en: We stand for Sweden's independence in peacetime and will, with firmness, defend our territory against every foreign intruder). In the early 1960s U.S. nuclear submarines armed with mid-range nuclear missiles of type Polaris A-1 were deployed outside the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made this a good area from which to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on Moscow. The submarines had to be very close to the Swedish coast to hit their intended targets though. As a consequence of this, in 1960, the same year that the submarines were first deployed, the U.S. provided Sweden with a military security guarantee. The U.S. promised to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. Knowledge of this guarantee was by the Swedish governments kept from the Swedish public until 1994, when a Swedish research commission found evidence for it. As part of the military cooperation the U.S. provided much help in the development of the Saab 37 Viggen, as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area. In return Swedish scientists at the Royal Institute of Technology made considerable contributions to enhancing the targeting performance of the Polaris missiles.Hemliga atomub√•tar gav Sverige s√§kerhetsgaranti Framsyn 2005, Nr. 1 (The Swedish Defence Research Agency‚Äôs bi-monthly publication)) Population change Since 1930, emigration has been slight. About 15,000-30,000 people left Sweden annually after 1965. Sweden welcomed refugees and displaced persons at the end of World War II. Because of the low birth rate, immigration accounted for 45% of population growth between 1945 and 1980. By 1991, 9% of the population had been born abroad. After 1980 immigration again increased rapidly, mostly because of new refugees, reaching more than 60,000 annually by 1990. The increase stirred some anti-immigrant feelings. Already by 1994 there were 508,000 foreign nationals in Sweden, concentrated mainly in the larger cities. The largest groups were Finns (210,000), Yugoslavs (70,000), Iranians (48,000), Norwegians (47,000), Danes (41,000), and Turks (29,000). Turks and Iranians make up 8% and 12% respectively of the foreign born non-European population. Aliens may vote in Swedish local elections after three years of legal residence.Irena Kogan, \\"Ex- Yugoslavs in the Austrian and Swedish labour markets: the significance of the period of migration and the effect of citizenship acquisition,\\" Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, Volume 29#4 July 2003, pp 595-622 Sweden became highly urbanized after World War II, reaching 83% urban in 1990 and 85% today. As recently as 1940 only 38% of the population lived in urban areas, and in 1860, before industrialization, the proportion was only 11%. Large-scale movement from the countryside to the United States ended about 1900. Since 1945 the movement to Swedish cities has accelerated and has brought about a population decline in many areas, especially in the north. Most cities are small. Only 10 cities have populations of more than 100,000. The Stockholm metropolitan areas has a population of 2 million; Gothenburg has 906,000 in its metropolitan area and Malm√∂ (including Lund) has 260,000, while the educational center of Uppsala has 130,000. The only large city in the north is Sundsvall (95,000 in metro area), which grew with the development of the forest industries in the 19th century and now is also a data processing center. Culture and mass media Cultural influence from the United Kingdom and the United States has been obvious since the war. Imported and indigenous subcultures rose, with the rockabilly-inspired raggare and anarchist progg cultures as notable examples. (Before the world wars, Swedish culture was more inspired by Germany). Swedish film and music achieved international fame with names like Ingmar Bergman, Sven Nykvist, Lasse Hallstr√∂m, Birgit Nilsson, ABBA, Entombed, Roxette, Denniz Pop and Max Martin. Currently, Sweden is the only non-English-speaking country in the world with a net export of music. Most Swedes are today proficient in English, a great deal of Swedish-produced popular music has originally English lyrics, and English language branding is very common. The sexual revolution, together with sexual content in mass media (notably films 491 and I Am Curious (Yellow), together with the broad entry of women in many lanes of professional life (including the priesthood) in the 1960s and 1970s provoked a moralist counter-movement including the Christian Democratic party, but this trend has had scant political success. Radio and television early became widespread in Sweden, but government struggled to keep the monopoly of licence-funded Sveriges television until the late 1980s, as satellite and cable TV became popular, and the commercial channel TV4 was permitted to broadcast terrestrially. Sports Sweden has produced many world-famous athletes during this period, among them boxer Ingemar Johansson, alpine skier Ingemar Stenmark, tennis player Bj√∂rn Borg and ice hockey players B√∂rje Salming and Kent Nilsson. Sweden has hosted several high-profile sports events, for instance equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 1958 FIFA World Cup.

Some Japanese Americans sent their children, many of whom had dual citizenship, back to Japan, so the children were educated in Japanese school systems and maintained the Japanese language as well as Japanese cultural traditions. Another reason was the strong anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States and these parents worried that they might be deported back to Japan. As a result, they sent their children to Japan, so they could survive either in the United States or Japan. The exact number is not known‚Äîperhaps about 11,000. It is said there were about 10,000 Kibei among Nisei (second- generation) Japanese Americans. Those men who were in school in Japan in late 1941 typically entered the Japanese army. Those on the West coast of the United States were interned. Many volunteered for service with the U.S., especially as translators. Another case was Minoru Wada, an American citizen educated in Japan who served as a Japanese Army junior officer. He was taken prisoner in the Philippines in 1945. He provided U.S. bomber crews with vital intelligence, and led the aircraft in a highly successful attack on the headquarters of the Japanese 100th Division.

A sailing scow, she was used as a supply ship in the South Pacific from 1942 to 1944.  History  A twin-masted scow (flat-bottomed schooner) of New Zealand registry, Echo was built in New Zealand in 1905 by William Brown, of kauri timber. She was originally topsail rigged. Twin diesel engines were installed in 1920. She was transferred to the US Navy under reverse Lend-Lease from New Zealand and commissioned on 4 November 1942 with Ensign Meredith C. \\"Rip\\" Riddle in command. Sailing from Auckland on 11 November 1942, Echo delivered cargo at Noumea en route to Efate in the New Hebrides. Based on this island at Port Vila, she served as a supply ship for the United States Army in the New Hebrides and adjoining island groups as well as placing and supporting Coastwatchers. On 14 February 1944, just prior to her departure for New Zealand, the Army awarded her crew a commendation. She arrived at Wellington on 12 March 1944, was decommissioned three days later, and returned to the New Zealand Government.  Film and TV series  In 1942‚Äì44 she was used by US forces in the Pacific, and her story was the basis for the 1960 film with Jack Lemmon, The Wackiest Ship in the Army and the 1965 TV series of the same name. The storyline involved a secret mission with an Australian Coastwatcher, played by Chips Rafferty.  Postwar  She was in use carrying cargo from Marlborough to Wellington until 1965, and hence was not available for the film. She was then used from 1972 as clubrooms by the Marlborough Cruising Club, but she deteriorated, and was nearly broken up in 1990. She was preserved, but in poor condition, at Picton, New Zealand as the Echo Gallery, a scow museum and bar. After the bar closed and the ship deteroriated more, Port Marlborough bought the ship from its private owners, and she was broken up in April 2015.Demolition work on historic Echo begins in Picton (Marlboro Express, retrieved 2015-08-27)  External links History, with photo in wartime service and contact details *Details on Maritime database, with contact details *Details of 1959 newsreel film  References  Category:Unclassified miscellaneous vessels of the United States Navy Category:Merchant ships of New Zealand Category:Ships built in New Zealand Category:1942 ships Category:Schooners of the United States Navy Category:Picton, New Zealand ","title":"USS Echo (IX-95)"},{"id":"5980245","text":"In literary criticism, an idiot plot is \\"a plot which is kept in motion solely by virtue of the fact that everybody involved is an idiot,\\" and where the story would otherwise be over, or possibly not even happen, if this were not the case. It is a narrative where its conflict comes from characters not recognizing, or not being told, key information that would resolve the conflict, often because of plot contrivance. The only thing that prevents the conflict's resolution is the character's constant avoidance or obliviousness of it throughout the plot, even if it was already obvious to the viewer, so the characters are all \\"idiots\\" in that they are too obtuse to simply resolve the conflict immediately. Science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, in his 1956 collection In Search of Wonder, attributes the first use of the term to author James Blish. Knight went on to coin the term second-order idiot plot, \\"in which not merely the principals, but everybody in the whole society has to be a grade-A idiot, or the story couldn't happen.\\" Reviewing Prime in 2005, critic Roger Ebert said \\"I can forgive and even embrace an Idiot Plot in its proper place (consider Astaire and Rogers in Top Hat). But when the characters have depth and their decisions have consequences, I grow restless when their misunderstandings could be ended by words that the screenplay refuses to allow them to utter.\\" Alternate formulations describe only the protagonist as being an idiot. Writing in 2013, author David Brin explored one variation of the idiot plot. In most adventure films and novels, the writers and directors have an imperative to keep their protagonists in jeopardy. This becomes difficult if they are surrounded by skilled professionals, paid to intervene and help if called. Hence, storytellers feel compelled to separate their characters from meaningful help, so that any assistance they receive is either late or else below the level of danger offered by the antagonists. The more powerful the villains, the more competent that help is allowed to be. \\"But for the most part, institutions and your neighbors are portrayed as sheep, so that only the hero's actions truly matter.\\"  Examples  Back to the Future Part II has been described as being based on an idiot plot. In the beginning, Doc Brown arrives and urges Marty and Jennifer to come along with him completely unprepared to 2015, to prevent their future children from mischief. There is no reason why Doc takes Jennifer along, as he paralyses her quickly after their arrival in 2015 anyway, and he could have easily looked for an opportunity to take Marty alone. Even more so, in the coming 30 years Marty and Jennifer should have plenty of opportunities to influence their kids' upbringing on the advice of Doc, even without hazardous time travel. * Writer Dennis Russell Bailey commented about the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Samaritan Snare that \\"none of the plot could have happened if all of the characters hadn't suddenly became morons that week,\\" ignoring the advice of expert officers and disregarding elementary security procedures.Gross, Edward; Altman, Mark A.: Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, Little Brown & Co (1995), See also Plot hole * Comedy of errors * Farce References External links Idiot Plot on TV Tropes Category:Narratology Category:20th-century neologisms Category:Narrative techniques ","title":"Idiot plot"},{"id":"5980253","text":"The Astor Cup was awarded by members of the Astor family in the United States in two different sports: * Astor Cup (auto race), run in New York in 1915 and 1916 with the trophy donated by Vincent Astor.

Agriculture in Egypt has existed since 5500 BC. Desert farming is the practice of developing agriculture in deserts. As agriculture depends upon irrigation and water supply, farming in arid regions where water is scarce is a challenge. However, desert farming has been practiced by humans for thousands of years. In the Negev Desert, there is evidence to suggest agriculture as far back as 5000 BC. Today, the Imperial Valley in southern California, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Palestine are examples of modern desert agriculture. Water efficiency has been important to the growth of desert agriculture. Water reuse, desalination, and drip irrigation are all modern ways that regions and countries have expanded their agriculture despite being in an arid climate.  History  Prickly pear cactus is grown in arid conditions. Humans have been practicing and refining agriculture for millennia. Many of the earliest civilizations such as ancient Assyria, Israel/Judah, Egypt, and the Indus River Valley Civilization were founded in irrigated regions surrounded by desert. As these civilizations grew, the ability to rear crops in the desert became of increasing importance. There are also instances of civilizations that subsisted primarily in the desert with little irrigation or rainfall, such as various western American Indian tribes. = Native Americans = The Native Americans practicing this agriculture included the ancient and no longer present Anasazi, the long-present Hopi, the Tewa, Zuni, and many other regional tribes, including the relatively recently arriving (about 1000 to 1400 CE) Navajo. These various tribes were characterized generally by the Spanish occupiers of the region as Sinagua Indians, sinagua meaning \\"without water\\", although this term is not applied to the modern Native Americans of the region. Owing to the great dependence upon weather, an element considered to be beyond human control, substantial religious beliefs, rites, and prayer evolved around the growing of crops, and in particular the growing of the four principal corn types of the region, characterized by their colors: red, yellow, blue, and white. The presence of corn as a spiritual symbol can often be seen in the hands of the \\"Yeh\\" spirit figures represented in Navajo rugs, in the rituals associated with the \\"Corn Maiden\\" and other kachinas of the Hopi, and in various fetish objects of tribes of the region. American Indians in the Sonoran Desert and elsewhere relied both on irrigation and \\"Ak-Chin\\" farming‚Äîa type of farming that depended on \\"washes\\" (the seasonal flood plains by winter snows and summer rains). The Ak-Chin people employed this natural form of irrigation by planting downslope from a wash, allowing floodwaters to slide over their crops. In the Salt River Valley, now characterized by Maricopa County, Arizona, a vast canal system was created and maintained from about 600 AD to 1450 AD. Several hundred miles of canals fed crops of the area surrounding Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler and Mesa, Arizona. Unfortunately, the intense irrigation increased the salinity of the topsoil, making it no longer fit for the growing of crops. This seems to have contributed to the abandonment of the canals and the adoption of Ak-Chin farming. The ancient canals served as a model for modern irrigation engineers, with the earliest \\"modern\\" historic canals being formed largely by cleaning out the Hohokam canals or being laid out over the top of ancient canals. The ancient ruins and canals of the Hohokam Indians were a source of pride to the early settlers who envisioned their new agricultural society rising as the mythical phoenix bird from the ashes of Hohokam society, hence the name Phoenix, Arizona. The canal system is especially impressive because it was built without the use of metal implements or the wheel. It took remarkable knowledge of geography and hydrology for ancient engineers to lay out the canals, but it also took remarkable socio-political organization to plan workforce deployment, including meeting the physical needs of laborers and their families as well as maintaining and administering the water resources.  Contemporary desert farming  Desert agriculture is more important than ever before as global population rises. Countries and regions that are not water-secure are no exception to increasing population and thus increasing demand for food. The Middle East and North Africa is perhaps the largest example of growing nations with little to no water security or food security. By 2025, it is estimated that 1.8 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity. = Israel = A farm in modern-day Israel utilizing drip irrigation. Agriculture in modern-day Israel has pioneered several techniques for desert agriculture. The invention of drip irrigation by Simcha Blass has led to a large expansion of agriculture in arid regions, and in many places drip irrigation is the de facto irrigation technique utilized. Studies have consistently shown large water use reduction with drip irrigation or fertigation, with one study returning an 80% decrease in water use and 100% increase in crop yields. The same study (conducted on a sub-Saharan African village) found that this resulted in an improvement in the standard of living in the village by 80%. Another hurdle for many water-scarce nations is consumption of water. Israel has chosen to take a focus on wastewater reuse to combat losing its water resources. The small desert nation reuses 86% of its wastewater as of 2011, and 40% of the total water used by agriculture was reclaimed wastewater. Desalination, brackish, or effluent water also accounts for 44% of Israel's water supply, and the world's largest seawater desalination plant in the world is the Sorek Desalination Plant located in Tel Aviv. The plant is able to produce 624,000 m¬≥ of water per day. The agricultural output of Israel has increased sevenfold since the country's independence in 1948, and total farmland has increased from 165,000 hectares to 420,000 hectares. The country produces 70% of its own food (in dollar value). = Imperial Valley = Fields in the Imperial Valley, California as seen from above. The Imperial Valley is a valley in the Sonoran Desert that has been farmed for 90 years in southern California. Prior to the 20th century, the valley was unsettled except for a few small settlements in the 19th century. It is supplied with water via the All-American Canal, a canal from the Colorado River. It is estimated that around 2/3 of vegetables consumed in the winter in the United States originate from the Imperial Valley. Imperial County is responsible for the most lamb and sheep production in the country. = Australia = Adults over the age of 15 in Australia employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing by percentage. Based on 2011 Australian Census Data. Despite Australia being a vastly arid nation, agriculture has been a staple of the Australian economy since its founding. Australia produces cattle, wheat, milk, wool, barley, poultry, lamb, sugar cane, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Agriculture provides 2.2% of Australia's total employment, and 47% of the total area in Australia is occupied by farms or ranches.

The latter was the producer and also in charge of the stop motion animation. The film was one of the highest- grossing films of 1962. It won one Oscar and was nominated for three additional Academy Awards. Several prominent actors‚Äîincluding Laurence Harvey, Karlheinz B√∂hm, Jim Backus, Barbara Eden, and Buddy Hackett‚Äîare in the film. It was filmed in the Cinerama process, which was photographed in an arc with three lenses, on a camera that produced three strips of film. Three projectors, in the back and sides of the theatre, produced a panoramic image on a screen that curved 146 degrees around the front of the audience. Plot The story focuses on the Grimm brothers, Wilhelm and Jacob, and is biographical and fantastical at the same time. They are working to finish a history for a local Duke, though Wilhelm is more interested in collecting fairy tales and often spends their money to hear them from locals. Tales such as \\"The Dancing Princess\\" and \\"The Cobbler and the Elves\\" are integrated into the main plot. One of the tales is told as an experiment to three children in a book store to see if publishing a collection of fairy tales has any merit. Another tale, \\"The Singing Bone\\", is told by an old woman in the forest who tells stories to children, while the uninvited Wilhelm secretly listens through an open window. The culmination of this tale involves a jeweled dragon and features the most involved usage of the film's special effects. Wilhelm loses the manuscript of the Duke's family history while writing down this third story - he is supposed to be collecting additional information for the family history - and the brothers cannot meet their deadline. They are required to pay their rent, which was waived while they worked. As a result of wading through a stream in an effort to retrieve the manuscript (which fell into the water after his briefcase broke open), Wilhelm becomes critically ill with potentially fatal pneumonia. He dreams that at night various fairy tale characters come to him, begging him to name them before he dies. In the dream, Russ Tamblyn reprises his role as Tom Thumb from the 1958 film. Wilhelm's fever breaks, and he recovers completely, continuing his own work while his brother publishes regular books, including a history of German grammar and a book on law. Jacob, shaken by his brother's experience, begins to collaborate on the fairy tales with Wilhelm. They are ultimately invited to receive honorary membership at the Berlin Royal Academy, which makes no mention of the tales in their invitation. Jacob prepares to make a speech deliberately insulting the Academy for snubbing Wilhelm. As their train pulls into the station, hordes of children arrive, chanting, \\"We want a story\\". Wilhelm begins, \\"Once upon a time, there were two brothers\\". The children cheer, and the film ends with a caption card that reads \\"‚Ä¶and they lived happily ever after\\".

He is best known for the poem Rekstefja, preserved in Bergsb√≥k and √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta. A few other disjoint verses by him are also known, quoted in Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, Lauf√°s-Edda and the Third Grammatical Treatise. Rekstefja traces the career of King √ìl√°fr Tryggvason from his upbringing in Russia to his fall at Sv√∂ldr. It consists of 35 dr√≥ttkv√¶tt verses. The poem's name derives from its refrain (Old Norse stef) which consists of three lines divided between three contiguous verses.Hoops 2003:70. The poem proclaims itself to be the third dr√°pa on √ìl√°fr Tryggvason, referring to two earlier ones by Hallfre√∞r vandr√¶√∞ask√°ld and the unknown Bjarni. The poem is technically accomplished and makes use of complex combinations of kennings. It is influenced by the works of Arn√≥rr jarlask√°ld and Einarr Sk√∫lason and has many similarities with √ìl√°fsdr√°pa Tryggvasonar, preserved in the same manuscript.Vries 1999:42-4. No biographical information on Hallar-Steinn has come down to us. His name may be derived from the farm-name H√∂ll in √ûver√°rhl√≠√∞ in Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur.Ross 2000:105. He was identified by some early commentators with the 11th century court poet Steinn Herd√≠sarson but this is rejected by modern scholars. Notes References Eysteinn Bj√∂rnsson (2002).

Her third husband was the French spy Thomas Pichon (1757‚Äì1760). Life and work She was born in 1711 in Rouen, the daughter of Marie-Barbe Plantart and Jean- Baptiste Le Prince, and died in 1780. She lost her mother when she was only eleven. After that, she and her younger sister were mentored by two wealthy women who entered them into the convent school at Ernemont in Rouen. They were educated and then taught there from 1725 to 1735.Le Prince de Beaumont, Marie. √âducation compl√®te ou Abr√©g√© de l'histoire universelle. London: J. Nourse, 1753. 7.

Details of a second marriage to Grimard de Beaumont are unclear. However, it is known that she bore a daughter, named Elisabeth, by Beaumont. In 1748, having separated from Beaumont in reaction to his marital infidelities, she left France to become a governess in London. She wrote several fairy tales, among them an abridged version of Beauty and the Beast, adapted from Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's original. After a successful publishing career in England, she left that country in 1763 with her daughter Elisabeth and son-in-law Moreau. She lived first in Savoy, near the city of Annecy, then moved to Avallon near Dijon in 1774 (see her personal letter #21 dated 22 December 1774 to Thomas Tyrrell). Her first work, the moralistic novel The Triumph of Truth (Le Triomphe de la v√©rit√©), was published in 1748. She published approximately seventy volumes during her literary career. Most famous were the collections she called \\"magasins,\\" instructional handbooks for parents and educators of students from childhood through adolescence. She was one of the first to include folk tales as moralist and educational tools in her writings.

Characteristics  Kansas City barbecue is characterized by its use of a wide variety of meats: pork, beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, sausage, and sometimes even fish. Just about any type of barbecued meat served in the country's other barbecue capitals, from pulled pork to brisket to beef ribs and pork ribs in a number of different cuts, is served in KC-area barbecue restaurants. Burnt ends ‚Äì the crusty, fatty, flavorful meat cut from the point of a smoked beef brisket ‚Äì are much in demand. Kansas City barbecue is rubbed with spices, slow-smoked over a variety of woods and served with a thick tomato-based barbecue sauce, which is an integral part of KC-style barbecue. Most local restaurants and sauce companies offer several varieties with sweet, spicy and tangy flavor profiles, but the staple sauce tends to be both sweet (often from molasses) and spicy. Kansas City barbecue is also known for its many side dishes, including a unique style of baked beans, French fries, coleslaw, and other Southern-food staples.  Barbecue in Kansas City  The Kansas City metropolitan area has more than 100 barbecue restaurants, a number of which are nationally renowned. The area is also home to several large barbecue cooking contests, notably the Great Lenexa BBQ Battle and the American Royal World Series of Barbecue, the largest barbecue competition in the world. History =Henry Perry= Urban Kansas City traces its barbecue history to Henry Perry, who operated out of a trolley barn at 19th and Highland in the legendary African-American neighborhood around 18th and Vine. Perry served slow-cooked ribs on pages of newsprint for 25 cents a slab. Perry came from Shelby County, Tennessee, near Memphis, and began serving barbecue in 1908. Kansas City and Memphis barbecue styles are very similar, although Kansas City tends to use more sauce and a wider variety of meats. Perry's sauce had a somewhat harsh, peppery flavor. Perry's restaurant became a major cultural point during the heyday of Kansas City Jazz during the \\"wide-open\\" days of Tom Pendergast in the 1920s and 1930s. =Arthur Bryant= Arthur Bryant's Barbecue at 18th and Brooklyn in Kansas City Working for Henry Perry was Charlie Bryant, who, in turn, brought his brother, Arthur Bryant, into the business. Charlie took over the Perry restaurant in 1940 after Perry died. Arthur then took over his brother's business in 1946, and the restaurant was renamed Arthur Bryant's. Arthur Bryant's, which eventually moved to 1727 Brooklyn in the same neighborhood, became a stomping ground for baseball fans and players in the 1950s and 1960s, because of its close proximity to Municipal Stadium, where the Athletics or A's played their home games during that period. In April 1972, Kansas City native Calvin Trillin wrote an article in Playboy proclaiming Bryant's to be the best restaurant on the planet. Despite new-found fame, Bryant did not change the restaurant's very simple decor, which consisted of fluorescent lighting, formica tables, and five-gallon jars of sauce displayed in the windows, even as Presidents Harry Truman, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan stopped by. Bryant died of a heart attack, in a bed that he kept at the restaurant, shortly after Christmas of 1982. The restaurant is still open. The sauce and restaurant continue their success. Along the main inner wall of the restaurant is photographic history of many famous politicians, actors, actresses and sports figures and other tribute pictures of military personnel displaying Arthur Bryant's memorabilia such as shirts or bottles of sauce. =Gates & Sons= In 1946 Arthur Pinkard, who was a cook for Perry, joined with George Gates to form Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q. The restaurant was situated initially in the same neighborhood. Gates Bar-B-Q headquarters on Brush Creek in Kansas City Gates barbecue sauce does not contain molasses; the ingredients, as listed on the bottle, are: \\"Tomatoes, vinegar, salt, sugar, celery, garlic, spices, and pepper. 1/10 of 1% potassium sorbate preservative added.\\" It is available in Original Classic, Mild, Sweet & Mild, and Extra Hot varieties. Gates also expanded its footprint in a more conventional way, with restaurants all displaying certain trademarks ‚Äì red-roofed buildings, a recognizable logo (a strutting man clad in tuxedo and top hat) and the customary \\"Hi, May I Help You?\\" greeting belted out by its employees as patrons enter. Gates has opened restaurants throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area. The chain currently consists of 6 area Gates Bar-B-Q restaurants: 4 in Missouri, 2 in Kansas. Gates also has sold barbecue sandwiches at Kauffman Stadium during Kansas City Royals home games, and currently at Arrowhead Stadium during Kansas City Chiefs home games. Other notable restaurants =Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue= Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue had its beginnings as the second restaurant in the Smokestack BBQ chain, which Russ Fiorella, Sr. had started in 1957. Fiorella's eldest son Jack worked with his father until 1974, when he and his wife Delores opened their own Smokestack location in the Martin City neighborhood of south Kansas City. Eventually Jack, along with his wife and children, decided to expand their menu selections, adding non-traditional barbecue menu items like hickory-grilled steaks, lamb ribs, Crown Prime Beef Short Ribs, and fresh, hickory-grilled seafood, along with an extensive wine and bar selection. They also began offering a higher level of comfort and service than most people were accustomed to at a barbecue restaurant. Smokestack BBQ in Martin City soon became one of the most successful restaurants in the Kansas City metro. In 1996, Jack Fiorella was named Restaurateur of the Year by the Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association. By the mid-1990s, Jack Fiorella decided to replicate the success of his Martin City Smokestack restaurant. Other members of the Fiorella family told Jack that he was not permitted to use the Smokestack name for his new restaurant, so both the new restaurant (opened in 1997 in Overland Park, Kansas) and Jack's existing restaurant in Martin City dropped the Smokestack name and were rebranded as Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue. They also opened a full-service catering operation in Martin City and their third location in the historic Freight House building in the Crossroads Arts District. They began shipping their barbecue nationwide in 2000, and in October 2006 they opened a fourth location on The Country Club Plaza. In 2014, a fifth Jack Stack restaurant opened in Lee's Summit, Missouri. The original Smokestack chain closed its last remaining location in 2012. Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue has been featured on The Food Network and The History Channel, and has been rated as among the best barbecue in the United States by several national organizations and magazines. Most notably, the Zagat Survey has named it the \\"#1 Barbecue House in the Country.\\" =Joe's Kansas City= The original Joe‚Äôs Kansas City Bar-B-Que in Kansas City, Kansas Joe‚Äôs Kansas City Bar-B-Que can be traced to competition barbecue and the Kansas City Barbeque Society (KCBS). Accompanying friends at the American Royal and The Great Lenexa BBQ Battle inspired Jeff Stehney to start cooking on his own. The first smoker purchased was an Oklahoma Joe‚Äôs 24‚Äù smoker, christened in April 1991. By 1993, Jeff, his wife and business partner Joy, and Jim \\"Thurston\\" Howell were ready to make their mark on the KCBS competition circuit. Their competition team, Slaughterhouse Five, ended up winning eight Grand Championships, including the prestigious American Royal BBQ, three Reserve Grand Championships, and the KCBS‚Äôs Grand Champion ‚ÄúTeam of the Year‚Äù in 1993. Over the next several seasons Slaughterhouse Five won dozens more awards and was generally recognized as one of the top competition BBQ teams in the Country. Jeff and Joy opened Oklahoma Joe's Bar-B-Que (later renamed to Joe‚Äôs Kansas City Bar-B-Que) in a gas station in Kansas City, Kansas in 1996. There are also locations in Olathe, Kansas and Leawood, Kansas. Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain listed Joe's original Kansas City, Kansas location as one of \\"13 Places You Must Eat Before You Die\\". Men's Health magazine named it America's manliest restaurant. Joe's was featured on Season 3 of Man v. Food in August 2010. It was also named \\"Kansas City's Best Barbecue\\" by Zagat.13 places to eat - Oklahoma Joe's =KC Masterpiece= In 1977, Rich Davis capitalized on the reputation of Kansas City barbecue to form KC Masterpiece, which evolved from his \\"K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce\\". KC Masterpiece is sweeter and thicker than many of the traditional Kansas City sauces served in the region. The KC Masterpiece recipe uses extra molasses to achieve its thick, sweet character. KC Masterpiece was sold to the Kingsford division of Clorox in 1986 and now claims to be the number one premium barbecue brand in the U.S. When Davis sold the rights to his sauce to Kingsford, he announced plans to build a franchise of barbecue restaurants. The franchises were successful for a few years, but have since all closed. =Curt's Famous Meats= Curt‚Äôs Famous Meats storefront Curt's Famous Meats is a meat market founded in 1947 by Curtis Jones and sold to Donna Pittman in 1989. With clientele from all across America, Curt's specializes in barbecue prepared with Kansas City rub. It has a long history of award-winning barbecue, having won eight times the American Royal barbecue competition, the largest in the world. Curt's is located on East Truman Road in the Maywood neighborhood of Independence, Missouri. Although not in Kansas City proper, Curt's has been a large competitor in many local competitions in barbecue. Curt's Famous Meats is also known for its predominantly female staff that Donna Pittman has hired. They are known locally as the Lady Meat Cutters. = Jones Bar-B-Q = Jones Bar-B-Q is an independent barbecue joint on Kaw Drive in Kansas City, Kansas, owned by Deborah and Mary Jones. In 2001 Doug Worgul featured Jones Bar-B-Q in the afterword of The Grand Barbecue: A Celebration of the History, Places, Personalities and Techniques of Kansas City Barbecue. Worgul said the sisters' barbecue \\"represent[ed] an artisan approach that cannot be replicated in higher-volume barbecue restaurants\\" and calls the location, a former taco stand, \\"the jointiest joint I've ever seen.\\" In 2016 Ardie Davis called it \\"old school\\", saying the barbecue is straightforward, not oversmoked, and not overtrimmed. As of 2016 the Kansas City Star considered them possibly the only Kansas City barbecue owned and operated by women pitmasters. The sisters do not participate in the barbecue competition circuit. In 2018 they appeared on an episode of Steve Harvey's Steve in a segment titled \\"The Queens of Barbecue.\\" In March 2019 the sisters and the barbecue were featured on the third season of American television series Queer Eye, which was filmed in and near Kansas City. Both they and the restaurant received a makeover, and they started bottling their sauce. In the aftermath they had to put in a second barbecue pit to handle demand. In 2019 Jones Bar- B-Q's Coconut Pineapple sauce was named by Bloomberg News as one of their five favorite barbecue sauces. Kansas City Barbeque Society The Kansas City Barbeque Society (KCBS) was founded in 1986. With over 13,000 members worldwide, it is the world‚Äôs largest organization of barbecue and grilling enthusiasts. KCBS is a nonprofit organization dedicated to \\"promoting barbecue as America's cuisine and having fun while doing so.\\" KCBS sanctions nearly 300 barbecue contests across the U.S. each year and offers assistance to civic and charitable organizations with producing these events. The KCBS has developed a set of rules and regulations that govern all official KCBS competitions. KCBS offers educational programs, consultation services and civic organization presentations to help spread the gospel of barbecue. The mission of the Kansas City Barbeque Society is to celebrate, teach, preserve and promote barbecue as a culinary technique, sport and art form.

Butterworth- Heinemann, Boston 1997. Blinking covers the eye with a thin layer of tear fluid, thereby promoting a moist environment necessary for the cells of the exterior part of the eye. The tears also flush out foreign bodies and wash them away. This is crucial to maintain lubrication and proper eye health. If this process is impaired, as in lagophthalmos, the eye can suffer abrasions and infections. Lagopthalmos leads to corneal drying and ulceration. Type(s) Nocturnal lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids during sleep. It may reduce the quality of sleep, cause exposure-related symptoms or, if severe, cause corneal damage (exposure keratopathy). The degree of lagophthalmos can be minor (obscure lagophthalmos) or quite obvious. It is often caused by an anomaly of the eyelid that prevents full closure. Treatment may involve surgery to correct the malposition of the eyelid(s). Punctal plugs may be used to increase the amount of lubrication on the surface of the eyeball by blocking some of the tear-drainage ducts. Eye drops may also be used to provide additional lubrication or to stimulate the eyes to increase tear production. The condition is not widely understood; in one instance, a passenger was removed from a US Airways flight because of it. Pathophysiology Lagophthalmos can arise from a malfunction of the facial nerve.Kliniska F√§rdigheter: Informationsutbytet Mellan Patient Och L√§kare, LINDGREN, STEFAN, Lagopthalmos can also occur in comatose patients having a decrease in orbicularis tone, in patients having palsy of the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), in people with severe exophthalmos and in people with severe skin disorders such as ichthyosis. Today, lagophthalmos may arise after an upper blepharoplasty, which is an operation performed to remove excessive skin overlying the upper eyelid (suprapalpebral hooding) that often occurs with aging. This can make the patient look younger, but if too much skin is removed, the appearance is unnatural and lagophthalmos may occur. Treatment Treatment of lagopthalmos can include both supportive care methods as well as surgical options. If unable to receive surgery, patients should be administered artificial tears at least four times per day to the cornea to preserve the tear film. In preparation for surgery, a patient may undergo a tarsorrhaphy, in which the eye is partially sewn shut temporarily to further protect the cornea as the patient waits for care. Multiple surgical treatments exist for lagopthalmos, but the most prevalent method includes weighing the upper eyelid down by surgically inserting a gold plate. Because of possible complications in conjunction with both the upper and lower eyelid, a second surgery may be required to tighten and elevate the lower eyelid to ensure that both the upper and lower eyelids can fully close and protect the cornea. Etymology The name of the condition derives from the Greek ŒªŒ±Œ≥œâœåœÇ (lagoos, \\"hare\\"), referring to the myth that hares sleep with their eyes open.

In organic chemistry, propellane is any member of a class of polycyclic hydrocarbons, whose carbon skeleton consists of three rings of carbon atoms sharing a common carbon‚Äìcarbon covalent bond. The name derives from a supposed resemblance of the molecule to a propeller: namely, the rings would be the propeller's blades, and the shared C‚ÄìC bond would be its axis. The concept was introduced in 1966 by D. Ginsburg Propellanes with small cycles are highly strained and unstable, and are easily turned into polymers with interesting structures, such as staffanes. Partly for these reasons, they have been the object of much research. In the literature, the bond shared by the three cycles is usually called the \\"bridge\\"; the shared carbon atoms are then the \\"bridgeheads\\". The notation [x.y.z]propellane means the member of the family whose rings have x, y, and z carbons, not counting the two bridgeheads; or x + 2, y + 2, and z + 2 carbons, counting them. The chemical formula is therefore C2+x+y+zH2(x+y+z). The minimum value for x, y, and z is 1, meaning a 3-carbon ring.There is no structural ordering between the rings, so, for example, [1.3.2]propellane is the same substance as [3.2.1]propellane. Therefore, it is customary to sort the indices in decreasing order, x ‚â• y ‚â• z. General properties =Strain= In the propellanes with small cycles, such as [1.1.1]propellane or [2.2.2]propellane, the two carbons at the ends of the axial bond will be highly strained, and their bonds may even assume an inverted tetrahedral geometry. The resulting steric strain causes such compounds to be unstable and highly reactive. The axial C-C bond is easily broken (even spontaneously) to yield less-strained bicyclic or even monocyclic hydrocarbons. Surprisingly, the most strained member [1.1.1] is far more stable than the other small ring members ([2.1.1], [2.2.1], [2.2.2], [3.2.1], [3.1.1], and [4.1.1]). =Polymerization= In principle, any propellane can be polymerized by breaking the axial C‚ÄìC bond to yield a radical with two active centers, and then joining these radicals in a linear chain. For the propellanes with small cycles (such as [1.1.1], [3.2.1], or 1,3-dihydroadamantane), this process is easily achieved, yielding either simple polymers or alternating copolymers. For example, [1.1.1]propellane yields spontaneously an interesting rigid polymer called staffane; and [3.2.1]propellane combines spontaneously with oxygen at room temperature to give a copolymer where the bridge-opened propellane units [‚ÄìC8H12‚Äì] alternate with [‚ÄìO‚ÄìO‚Äì] groups. =Synthesis= The smaller-cycle propellanes are difficult to synthesize because of their strain. Larger members are more easily obtained. Weber and Cook described in 1978 a general method which should yield [n.3.3]propellanes for any n ‚â• 3. Members =True propellanes= [1.1.1]Propellane, C5H6, CAS number (K. Wiberg and F. Walker, 1982). It is a highly strained molecule: the two central carbons have an inverted tetrahedron geometry, and each of the three cycles is the notoriously strained cyclopropane ring. The length of the central bond is only 160 pm. It is an unstable product that undergoes thermal isomerization to 3-methylenecylobutene at 114 ¬∞C,and spontaneously reacts with acetic acid to form a methylenecyclobutane ester. *[2.1.1]Propellane, C6H8, CAS number (K. Wiberg, F. Walker, W. Pratt, and J. Michl). This compound was detected by infrared spectroscopy at 30 K but has not been isolated as a stable molecule at room temperature (as of 2003). It is believed to polymerize above 50 K. The bonds of the shared carbons have an inverted tetrahedral geometry; the compound's strain energy was estimated as 106 kcal/mol. *[2.2.1]Propellane, C7H10, CAS number (F. Walker, K. Wiberg, and J. Michl, 1982). Obtained gas- phase dehalogenation with alkali metal atoms. Stable only in frozen gas matrix below 50 K; oligomerizes or polymerizes at higher temperatures. The strain energy released by breaking the axial bond was estimated as 75 kcal/mol. *[3.1.1]Propellane, C7H10, CAS number . Isolable. *[3.2.1]Propellane or tricyclo[3.2.1.01,5]octane, C8H12, CAS number (K. Wiberg and G. Burgmaier, 1969). Isolable. Has inverted tetrahedral geometry at the shared carbons. Estimated strain energy of 60 kcal/mol. Remarkably resistant to thermolysis; polymerizes in diphenyl ether solution with halflife of about 20 hours at 195 ¬∞C. It reacts spontaneously with oxygen at room temperature to give a copolymer with ‚ÄìO‚ÄìO‚Äì bridges. *[4.1.1]Propellane, C8H12, CAS number (D. Hamon, V. Trennery, 1981) Isolable. *[2.2.2]Propellane or tricyclo[2.2.2.01,4]octane, C8H12, CAS number (P. Eaton and G. Temme, 1973). This propellane is unstable, too, due to the three cyclobutane-like rings and the highly distorted bond angles (three of them nearly 90¬∞, the other three nearly 120¬∞) at the axial carbons. Its strain energy is estimated to be 93 kcal/mol (390 kJ/mol). *[3.3.3]Propellane, C11H18, CAS number . It is a stable solid that melts at 130 ¬∞C. It was synthesized in 1978 by Robert W.

At the time the French, Spanish, Dutch and other armies employed units of Swiss mercenaries. The regiment was named for its commander, Colonel Charles-Daniel de Meuron, who was born in Neuch√¢tel in 1738. Dutch service The regiment served the VOC in Dutch Ceylon and Cape Town. In 1795, while the regiment was stationed in Ceylon, revolutionary French forces invaded the Netherlands, overthrew the Dutch Republic and replaced it with the Batavian Republic. As a result, the regiment's pay by the VOC fell into abeyance. Later that year the Kew Letters were issued by the deposed stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange, ordering the surviving Dutch colonies to surrender themselves to the British for safe keeping. The governor of Ceylon did not immediately do so, instead seeking clarification of the situation in the Netherlands. A delegation of Swiss soldiers and officers approached Count de Meuron, who retained the status of regimental proprietor, to discuss their overdue pay and the uncertain political situation. Transition As the governor was awaiting clarification, the British Secretary of State for War, Henry Dundas, acting on intelligence, convinced Prof. Hugh Cleghorn, of the University of Aberdeen, to travel to Neuch√¢tel to negotiate with Charles Daniel. Cleghorn persuaded Charles Daniel to come with him to Madras so facilitate negotiations with Pierre Fr√©d√©ric de Meuron, Charles Daniel's brother and the commander of the regiment in Ceylon.A. Baur (1997), p.103-4. Charles Daniel was able to smuggle a letter to his brother Pierre Frederick via a ball of Edam cheese. Subsequently, the Swiss agreed to hand over control of the regiment to the British, on the condition that they would not be required to serve against their former Dutch employers. The defection of the Swiss greatly reduced the strength of the Dutch forces in Ceylon and the Swiss provided fortification details to the British. The Dutch put up a pro-forma resistance using their own troops, and then surrendered Columbo to the British on 15 February 1796. The regiment formally entered British service, with the understanding that the British would enroll them at the same rate as regular British soldiers and give them the back pay owed by the VOC. The British subsequently took over control of the colony as British Ceylon. Professor Cleghorn received ¬£5000 as a reward for his role in the project. He also became the Chief Secretary of Ceylon. However, Cleghorn and Governor Frederick North, the first British civilian governor of the island, did not get on. Cleghorn resigned his post and returned to Scotland. British service The Seringapatnam battle (1799) - After 1796, the regiment changed from a blue Dutch uniform to the British red In August 1799, Colonel the Count De Meuron was breveted a Major-General in the British Army. Colonel Pierre Frederick Count De Meuron was breveted a Major-General in the Army, effective 1 January 1798. The order was issued in 1802 and backdated. Charles Daniel was eventually promoted to Lieutenant General, but then returned to Switzerland. Pierre Frederick remained in Ceylon with the regiment, and for a while was Acting Governor for the Colony until North arrived on 12 October 1798. The Meuron Regiment subsequently served in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War of 1799, the Mediterranean, and Peninsula Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars 1806 to 1812. The first mention of the regiment in combat for the British was during the siege of Seringapatam in 1799. Over time, especially by the time of the Peninsular campaigns, difficulties in obtaining replacements from Switzerland led to the regiment recruiting some Spanish and Portuguese recruits. The regiment was finally posted to Canada to serve in the War of 1812. During the war, the Regiment served at the Battle of Plattsburg. Later some of its soldiers also served at the Red River Colony. Some 150 recently discharged soldiers from the Regiment de Meuron and De Watteville's Regiment, still retaining their uniforms, participated in the Pemmican War. Rue des Meurons in the Winnipeg suburb of Saint Boniface is named after the regiment. Fate In 1816 the Meuron Regiment, together with other Swiss units in British service, was disbanded.Major R. M.

Boden killed four women, three in Montreal and one in Calgary, earning the nickname The Vampire Rapist for biting the breasts of his victims, and received four life sentences. Boden's was the first murder conviction in North America due to forensic odontological evidence. Biography Wayne Clifford Boden was born in 1948 in Dundas, Ontario. Boden attended Glendale Secondary School in Hamilton in the early to mid-1960s, where he was reportedly quiet, but muscular and played on the school senior football team. Murders =Shirley Audette= On 3 October 1969, Shirley Audette was found dead at the rear of an apartment complex in downtown Montreal, Quebec. Although she was fully clothed, she had been raped and strangled, and savage bite marks were found on her breasts. There were no signs of bloody skin under the fingernails of the victim, which led one biographer to theorize that she did not struggle against her assailant. One of Audette's former boyfriends told the police that he believed that she got involved with a very dominant, attractive man because she was \\"getting into something dangerous\\" but she never mentioned the man's name. Audette's boyfriend had been at work on the night shift, while Boden, who lived next door, met Audette outside the building where she sat when she felt nervous. =Marielle Archambault= On 23 November, Marielle Archambault, a jewellery clerk, left work at closing time with a young man whom she introduced to her co-workers as \\"Bill\\", and remarked that she seemed happy and entranced by the man. When Archambault did not report for work the following morning, her employer went to check on her in her apartment to see if she was ill. Together with her landlady, they discovered her fully clad body on the couch. The room was tidy, but Boden had ripped her pantyhose and bra, raped her, and left bite marks on her breasts. The police were able to find a crumpled photograph amid the wreckage of Archambault's apartment, which was readily identified as the mysterious \\"Bill\\" by her co-workers. However, despite this apparent break, the police were not successful in connecting the photograph to any known suspect, even through a police sketch based on the picture was distributed for publication in the newspapers. The photo turned out to be Archambault's dead father. =Jean Way= On 16 January 1970, Brian Caulfield, the boyfriend of Jean Way, 24, came to pick her up for a scheduled date at her apartment on Lincoln Street in downtown Montreal. When Way did not answer the door, he decided to come back a little later, but upon returning found the door unlocked. Caulfield found Way's naked body on the bed, with her breasts undamaged. Boden was most likely in Way's apartment when Caulfield was knocking at the door earlier that evening. An autopsy conducted by Dr. Jean- Paul Valcourt found two small fibers under the fingernails of her left hand, indicating thatcontrary to prior beliefthat Way had indeed struggled against Boden.Rapport Medico-Legal from the Institut de M√©decine Legal et de la police scientifique 20 January 1970, page 4 After Way's death, the resulting publicity from the murders caused a brief mass hysteria in Montreal, although this disappeared as Boden had fled the city and the murders stopped. =Elizabeth Anne Porteous= In Calgary, Alberta, a 33-year-old high school teacher named Elizabeth Anne Porteous did not report to work on the morning of 18 May 1971. Her apartment manager was called, who found her body on the bedroom floor. As with Marielle Archambault, her apartment showed considerable signs of a struggle, and Porteous had been raped and strangled. Her breasts were likewise mutilated with bite marks. Amid the wreckage, however, the police recovered a broken cufflink under the victim's body. In their investigation of the murder, the police were able to find out from two of her colleagues that she was seen at a stoplight riding in a blue Mercedes-Benz on the night she died; the car was reported as having a distinctive advertising bull-shaped decal in the rear window. A friend of the victim also informed police that she had been recently dating a man named \\"Bill\\", described as a \\"flashy\\" dresser with neat, short hair. =Arrest= The following day, on 19 May, the blue Mercedes was spotted by patrolmen, parked near the murder scene. Boden, a former fashion model, was arrested half an hour later as he went to his car. He told the police that he moved from Montreal a year previous and admitted that he had been dating Porteous and was with her on the night of the murder. When the broken cufflink was presented to him, he admitted its ownership. However, he insisted that Porteous was fine when he left her that night. The police in Calgary were in possession of a copy of the photograph recovered from Archambaut's apartment and, as Boden resembled the man in the picture, they held him for suspicion in murdering Porteous. Police then turned their attention to the marks on the victim's breasts. Odontological evidence The police contacted Gordon Swann, a local orthodontist, to help prove that the marks on Porteous' breasts and neck were Boden's bite marks, with the intent to verify them as having been left by Boden. As there was nothing in Canadian literature on forensic odontology at the time, Swann wrote to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States, hoping for any information on the matter. Swann received a reply from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who directed him to England, where he met a man who had dealt with 20 or 30 cases regarding bite marks. Swann was able to get the information he needed and based on a cast made of Boden's teeth, he managed to demonstrate 29 points of similarity between the bite marks in Porteous' body and Boden's teeth. Conviction The evidence provided by Gordon Swann was sufficient for the jury of Boden's trial to find him guilty for the murder of Elizabeth Porteous and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. Boden was the first murderer to be convicted in North America based on odontological evidence. Boden then returned to Montreal to face trial, where he confessed to three murders of Shirley Audette, Marielle Archambault, and Jean Way, and was sentenced to three additional life terms. Boden was sent to the Kingston Penitentiary in Kingston, Ontario, where he began serving his sentence on 16 February 1972. Boden was initially believed to be involved in the death of Norma Vaillancourt, a 21-year-old student killed on 23 July 1968, but denied involvement. In 1994, Raymond Sauve was convicted of Vaillancourt's death and sentenced to ten years in prison. In 1977, Boden was granted a credit card by American Express five years into his life sentence, which he used while out on a day pass from prison in Laval while eating lunch with his social worker in the Kon Tiki restaurant at the Mount Royal Hotel in downtown Montreal. He went to use the washroom and escaped through the bathroom window. He was recaptured several days later at a bar on Mackay Street in downtown Montreal.

The highway begins at The Lane and Thicket Lump Drive south of the town marina. Following Mill Landing Road through Wanchese, the road eventually becomes the western boundary for the Roanoke Island Marshes Dedicated Nature Preserve, before reaching its northern terminus at US 64. Route description NC 345 is a two-lane road that begins at the intersection of Thicket Lump Drive/The Lane in southeastern Wanchese. At first the highway runs northeast along Mill Landing Road, paralleling the curve in the Roanoke Sound. As the road approaches the town marina it turns directly toward a north/northwestern direction providing access to several docks along the western side of the marina. Passing by the marina, NC 345 turns west heading into a residential zone of the town. After passing Old Schoolhouse Road, NC 345 runs by the post office in Wanchese along with several other small businesses including a radio station. As the road nears Old Warf Road, it widens to include turn lanes, for the intersection on the edge of town. After the intersection, NC 345 turns slightly more northerly and leaves Wanchese. NC 345 runs through very marshy terrain north of town, with many small streams and lakes near the road. Several houses are built off of the side of the rural road, however the land remains fairly undeveloped. The highway becomes the western boundary for the Roanoke Island Marshes Dedicated Nature Preserve leading to why the area is so desolate. As the road nears its northern terminus, the land becomes more forested, and several houses and small businesses are built alongside of the road. Several other small neighborhoods are found off of the western side of the road. The highway makes several U-Shaped turns before passing by a water plant, and reaching its northern terminus at US 64. History NC 345 was an original state highway, which traversed from Wanchese to Manteo and possibly to the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site (confirmed by 1924). Around 1950, US 64/US 264 was routed onto Roanoke Island (ferry from Manns Harbor and bridge to Nags Head) with both sharing concurrency with NC 345 through Manteo. In 1965, NC 345 was reduced by at the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. In 1967, US 64/US 264 replaced NC 345 through Manteo, pushing its northern terminus to its current location. Also same year, NC 345 was rerouted in Wanchese, from going west to the Croatan Sound to east along the Mill Landing Creek area (originally NC 345A), ending at Thicket Lump Drive (SR 1141); its old alignment became Old Wharf Road (SR 1168). Junction list Special routes =Wanchese alternate spur= North Carolina Highway 345A (NC 345A) was established in 1929 as an alternate spur from NC 345 to the Mill Landing Creek area. Sometime between 1958-1962, the route was decommissioned, becoming Mill Landing Road (SR 1141). In 1963, this former route became part of mainline NC 345\\\\. =Manteo east spur= North Carolina Highway 345E (NC 345E) was established between 1931-1936 as an eastern spur from NC 345 into downtown Manteo. It is unknown if the route was actually signed during its time, but it appeared in Dare County Maps up through 1957. Sometime between 1958-1962, the route was decommissioned, becoming Highway Street and later Budleigh Street (SR 1150).

A schooner, she was acquired on 8 August 1942 as Pioneer, renamed El Cano on 17 August 1942, and served in a noncommissioned status in the 11th Naval District during World War II. Ship History On 13 Jul 42 VCNO asked BuShips to negotiate a bareboat charter agreement with the owner of the auxiliary steel schooner yacht PIONEER at $1.00 per year. This vessel had been designed by Cox & Stevens and built by Krupp's Germaniawerft at Kiel, Germany, in 1927 as CRESSIDA for the German-American industrialist Hermann Oelrichs, who was a member of the Vanderbilt family. She was reputed to be one of the fastest tall ships on the west coast, often making 14 knots in races off Newport Beach, Calif. Oelrichs sold her in the mid-1930s to George Washington Vanderbilt III, who used her for recreational cruises and to explore Africa and the South Seas. Vanderbilt renamed her PIONEER after 1937 and before visiting Isla Floreana (Galapagos) in her on 4 Jun 41. On 17 Aug 42 the Navy assigned her the name EL CANO \\"after the former vessel of that name\\" (presumably ELCANO, PG-38), and she operated during the rest of the war \\"in service\\" in the 11th Naval District. A report that the Coast Guard used EL CANO ex PIONEER for merchant training between 1939 and her return to the MC on 31 Aug 42 appears to be inconsistent with the preceding information, but merchant training could have been her function in the 11th Naval District. The schooner was returned to Mr. Vanderbilt in late 1945. PIONEER made her last major voyage in 1951, from California to Hawaii, and then remained pierside at Newport Beach from 1954 until Vanderbilt's death in 1961. She was sold in 1965 to Windjammer Barefoot Cruises and converted into the passenger ship YANKEE CLIPPER. She was refitted in 1987 with a third mast and a top deck. Windjammer ceased operations in 2007 and the ship is now (2009) laid up in Trinidad and looking for a buyer.

History Cross Roads is at the junction of Farm roads 59 and 3441 in southwestern Henderson County. The town was founded in 1846 by the Reverend Hezekiah Mitcham and his wife Mary Clarke Mitcham who had come from Marengo County, Alabama according to that county's 1830 Census. The earliest settlement was called Science Hill. In 1885 the Wildcat post office was opened at the site with George B. Thompson as postmaster. By 1892 the community had three cotton gins, a general store, and several other establishments, but the Wildcat post office closed in 1905. The community was also referred to as Thompson's Mill because of a water-powered mill built in 1871 by D. M. Thompson on Wildcat Creek. Cross Roads, as a named community, traces its origins to the early 1890s. A brush-arbor camp meeting of Baptists was held at the point where the road from Athens to Wildcat Ferry and the road from Malakoff to Palestine crossed, and gave the location the name \\"Cross Roads.\\" The first permanent building in the area was a church, which was erected after the Union-Center school moved from Thompson's Mill to the Cross Roads location. In 1908 a one-room school was erected; it was taught by Sam Holland, who later became district judge of Henderson County. In the early part of the twentieth century numerous gins, gristmills, and other businesses supportive of an agricultural community thrived at Cross Roads. There was a post office there until World War I, and a courthouse was built to house the justice of the peace court. In the mid-1920s, as a result of the merger of various smaller schools in the area, the Cross Roads Consolidated School was established. From the 1920s through the end of World War II the school was expanded and upgraded. The Work Projects Administration made several improvements to the school facility, and in the late 1940s the Cross Roads Independent School District was formed as the consolidation of eight common school districts in the general vicinity. After a disastrous fire in 1953 much of the school plant was rebuilt, except for the high school which was closed and students sent to nearby districts for high school education. In the late 1970s the district began adding high school grades, culminating in 1980 with the district's first high school graduating class since 1953. Cotton and ranching were the most important agricultural activities in the district, particularly in the Trinity River bottom, but other areas produced various truck crops and fruit. Discoveries of oil and gas in the 1940s and 1950s contributed to a brief resurgence. A population of 135 was reported in 1988, 1990, and 2000.Cross Roads at the TSHA website ReferencesHenderson County Historical Commission, Family Histories of Henderson County, Texas, 1846‚Äì1981 (Dallas: Taylor, 1981).

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 198 in 2018. It is located within the Palestine, Texas micropolitan area. History The community's name is thought to have originated with E.T. McDaniel, the first shopkeeper and postmaster, who had long sought to get a post office for the community. When the town was authorized a US post office in 1898, the residents called it a \\"slow come.\\" Many African Americans fled the area in July and August 1910, after the \\"Slocum Massacre\\", an unprovoked riot by 200 whites in which they killed at least 22 Blacks, and wounded countless others; they were unarmed. Casualties are believed to have been much higher, with perhaps as many as 120 injured (200, counted as 120 due to the \\"3/5 compromise\\") and dead. In 1914, the community had two general stores left and 45 people; the population increased to 200 by 1927. A tornado demolished Slocum in 1929, causing 8 deaths and 150 injuries. Only two houses were left standing in the settlement. By 1939 the community had rebuilt, and had eight new businesses and 160 inhabitants. The discovery of oil in nearby fields caused the community's economy to receive a boost in the late 1950s, and by 1964, the community's population grew to 200 residents. Afterward, the community declined to 110 people in 1970. It grew to 125 in 1974, holding there to 1990. The community had four businesses, two churches, and a few homes in the mid-1980s. It doubled to 250 in 2000, but declined to 175 in 2014. =Slocum Massacre of 1910= On July 29‚Äì30, 1910 an unknown number of African Americans were murdered by an all-white mob of an estimated 200 to 300 people.E. R. Bills. The 1910 Slocum Massacre: An Act of Genocide in East Texas. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2014 The original death-toll of the Slocum massacre was reported by newspapers as 8 to 22 victims. But evidence and survivors' stories say that the actual death-toll may have reached upwards of 200 victims. Bodies were found in fields and canebrakes. The state ordered in militia, and the commanding officer requested a company of militia as well. Before the massacre, the majority of Slocum's several hundred residents were black. During and afterward, many black residents fled the town, leaving behind real estate, homes, and other assets to save their lives. Their property was seized and the victims never received compensation. Several events may have sparked the attacks. After a black person was lynched nearby, rumors spread that blacks were planning revenge. Also, a scuffle broke out over a business disagreement between a white and black resident. Many accounts said that white resident James Spurger instigated events by claiming he was threatened by blacks. All known victims were unarmed, and most were shot in the back as they fled; no whites were injured. Spurger, Reagon McKenzie, S. F. Jennings, and at least 13 other white men were arrested for the attacks, and Spurger and six others were indicted, but none were ever tried. State Judge B.H. Gardner convened a grand jury; almost all local citizens were subpoenaed, and prominent people who resisted testifying were arrested. Seven of the men were indicted on 22 counts of murder; Gardner sent them to be tried in Houston but the special prosecutor did not proceed. Elections had removed Gardner and others involved in prosecuting the case from office, and the next administration did not pick it up again. The defendants were released without trial. In May 2014, freelance journalist E. R. Bills published The 1910 Slocum Massacre: An Act of Genocide in East Texas with The History Press. The following August, Constance Hollie- Jawaid, a Dallas Independent School District administrator, whose great- grandfather, John Holley, was among the Slocum Massacre victims, enlisted Bills to help file an application for a Texas state historical marker commemorating the Slocum Massacre. When the Anderson County Historical Commission repeatedly demonstrated antagonism toward Hollie-Jawaid's marker application, Hollie-Jawaid applied to the Texas State Historical Commission directly, and the marker was approved on January 29, 2015.Barajas, Michael. \\"Where the Bodies Are Buried.\\" Texas Observer, July, 2019. https://www.texasobserver.org/where-the-bodies-are-buried/ On January 16, 2016, the Slocum Massacre historical marker was placed and dedicated one-half mile south of Slocum on FM 2022. Jawaid's great-grandfather, John Holley, survived the massacre but fled with his family, losing the granary, dairy, and general store that he developed after being freed from slavery. Geography Slocum sits at the intersection of Farm to Market Road 2022 and Texas State Highway 294, southeast of Palestine in the southeastern part of Anderson County. Education Slocum had its own school in the mid-1980s. The Slocum Independent School District serves area students who attend Slocum High School and Slocum Elementary School. It is a very small school that as of 2016-2017 has around 300 students in the grades k-12 and is registered as a 1A by UIL.

The community shipped lumber. Two cotton gins and a hotel were then added to the community's business directory by 1890, and had a large growth in population with 400 settlers. A local store owner named J.B. McDonald also acted as Justice of the Peace in Nechesville, and advertised as a supplier of \\"meats and justice.\\" The community's name was then changed to Neches in 1892. The community then published two newspapers; the Southern Poultry Journal in 1896, and the Neches Tribune before the 1930s. Its population decreased to 261 people in 1900, and then grew back to 400 in the 1920s, which stayed around that in the 1930s. Neches had 24 businesses operating, as well as a population zenith of 900 in 1939, making it an extremely successful community. It began to fade not long after. Its population plunged to 280 in 1949, and continued to fall to 111 in 1970. There were three churches, two community halls, and six operating businesses in 1985. Its population grew to 114 in 1990, and then jumped some more to 175 in 2000. Geography Neches lies at the juncture of U.S. Highway 79 as well as Farm to Market Roads 321 and 2574 along the Union Pacific Railroad, northeast of Palestine and from the Neches River in eastern Anderson County.

In addition to Wortham, the district serves students in the town of Kirvin and rural areas of western Freestone County. The district extends into southern Navarro County and a small portion of northern Limestone County. Wortham ISD has three campuses: *Wortham High School (Grades 9-12) *Wortham Middle School (Grades 6-8) *Wortham Elementary School (Grades PK-5). In 2009, the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency. School history The town of Wortham, first known as Longbotham, was established by a Mexican Colonization land grant on July 24, 1835. (History of Freestone County Texas. By Freestone County Historical Commission, Volume 1, p. 209) The Methodist and Masonic lodge built a two story frame building that served the community for church services and Masonic meetings. It was believed by this organization that both boys and girls should be educated. As early as 1870, the Masons opened their building and established the first private school in Wortham. There is no record, but several people have reported that this building was located in the vicinity of 5th Street and Longbotham. The Masons maintained the school and provided textbooks and supplies. Ministers were used as teachers. The first public school in Wortham was organized in 1883 in a boxed building 25 by 30 feet in size, located where the middle school now stands. (Ibid. p. 209) Thomas Longbotham, Jack Berry, and Dick Knight were the trustees. The first teachers were Professor Miller and Mrs. Thyrsia Barrison who later became Mrs. George Bounds. The ABC's, McGuffey's Reader, Davie's Arithmetic, the Blue Back Speller and writing were taught to pupils of all ages, who were in classed according to their reading abilities. In this two-teacher school, the boys sat on one side of the room and the girls sat on the other. It was also noted that the recesses were arranged for the boys to play on one side of the yard and the girls to play on the other side. Mr. A. N. Weaver attended this school from 1883-1885. Mr. Weaver recalled his professor at the time being Professor Miller. Professor Miller was a strong disciplinarian who believed in whipping his pupils. It was because of this discipline that a second school was established. Several of the pioneer families organized, built a one-room building, purchased supplies, hired Miss Sallie Booth from Sam Houston State Teachers College for thirty dollars a month and sent their children to this private school. (Ibid. p. 210). Approximately thirty students, mostly girls, of all ages attended this school because the parents didn't want their children whipped. This private school is believed to have been located on the east side of the railroad track, which lasted for only five years. Professor William Kirvin followed Professor Miller in 1885 and served as principal until 1890. Under the supervision of Professor Kirvin in 1891, Wortham formed the first independent school district in Freestone County. (Ibid. p. 210) The first college graduate to teach in Wortham was Professor L. F. Cooper, who came to the school in 1890. He added Latin, algebra and geometry to the curriculum. In 1890, the school building was replaced by a two story frame building, which stood where the present kindergarten and first grade building is located. Fire destroyed this building in 1902, and a two story brick building was erected on the same location. A bell tower was built on top of the building to ring in the start of each new day. In 1904-1905, there was an enrollment of 339 children. The tax rate was fifty cents per $100, and the school property was valued at $10,825. A gradual increase in scholastics was noted from 1905 to 1911, and by 1913 Wortham was the first school in Freestone County to be granted affiliation with the State University. By 1918, C. V. Reed was superintendent of the school, which employed eight teachers. The school district, with an enrollment of 385 children in eleven grades, offered four years of accredited high school work. By 1922, the student body had outgrown the two story brick building. A new high school building was erected south of the old building. Trustees at this time were T. B. Poindexter, President; W. J Bryant, Secretary; Henry Meador, Will Calame, J. F. Wallis, John P. Stubbs and T. O. Sims. The new three story brick building costing $50,000 was for grades nine through twelve. The top floor consisted of an elaborate, fan-shaped auditorium with a wooden floor sloping to the edge of the stage. There were only two small classrooms located on the third floor. The discovery of oil around Wortham in 1924 brought money and pupils into the school over the Thanksgiving holiday. On Thanksgiving Day 1924, the Simmons Wild Cat Oil Well came in. The town of 1,000 became a town of 20,000 people almost over night. With each family, came numerous children until the classrooms were suddenly running over. Mrs. Angie Williams, teacher of third grade at that time, recalls the following experience: On Wednesday afternoon, November 23, 1924, at 4 o'clock, school was dismissed for the Thanksgiving holidays. The third grade consisted of 18 (eighteen) pupils ranging in ages from 9 to 10 years. On Thursday afternoon, the Simmons's well blew in making several thousand barrels of oil daily. Families began flocking into Wortham. By Monday morning the peaceful little town was seething with excitement; the children came from every direction to enroll in school. By 10:30 o'clock that morning, the teacher had enrolled 66 children in the third grade, making her a class of 84 in all. (Ibid. p. 211) They ranged from 8 to 14 years of age and came from public and parochial schools in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and New Mexico. Classrooms had desks to accommodate 24 children; so, after sitting them two to the desk and three if the children were small, wooden crates from the downtown merchants were lined up around the walls for the others. Due to lack of text books, most of the work had to be written on the board. What was true of the third grade was also in the other grades with exception of high school. Fewer high school children were enrolled. Uel L. Davis, Jr., a first grade student at the time of the oil boom, recalled that he and several of the students who lived on the east side of town, continued their year of education in the home of Mrs. Ada Peurifoy. With the number of people and the types of people that had infiltrated the small town of Wortham, their parents did not feel it was safe for the children to cross through town to the public school. (Past Interview) By 1926, there were twenty-three teachers and 600 students in the school. With twenty-seven affiliated units of instruction offered, the school was placed on the southern accrediting list of high schools. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Wortham Independent Colored School was very progressive. Myrtle Randle Fowlks researched and found that in the year 1932, Mr. F. W. Wheeler became the principal and agriculture teacher. Mr. Wheeler, principal, developed a strong industrial program along with the basic curriculum. It was under his administration that the school became Tuskegee of the West Training School, named after the Tuskegee Institute founded by Booker T. Washington in Georgia. The Wortham school had a farm where the students participated in growing fruits and vegetables. This produce was sold fresh or canned in the school's cannery. One of the products grown on this farm was broom corn. The school had a broom factory where they made brooms. There was also a printing shop where the basics of printing could be learned and job printing could be done for the public. His efforts brought state-wide publicity to the school. February 27, 1933, F. W. Wheeler resigned (Wortham ISD Board minutes. February 27, 1933) and A. E. Alton became principal and agriculture teacher. Under the administration of Mr. Alton, the name of the school changed back to Wortham Colored School. During the administration of Mr. M. W. Evans, 1940‚Äì49, the school became known for its interscholastic abilities in the county, region and state. The school had outgrown the old facilities and the school board decided a new building was very much needed. In 1957, the new building was opened and named F. W. Wheeler in this memory. Afro-American students continued their education there until 1966 when integration brought the students from the F. W. Wheeler School to join the students at Wortham Schools. (Once Is Not Enough, by F. W. Wheeler Ex-Student Association, pg.3) (Freestone County Deed Records). In keeping with the state policy of annexation and consolidation, New Hope and McLeod School Districts were added to the Wortham School District after 1927. Students from Rushing and Mt. Nebo schools who chose, were allowed to attend the Wortham Schools beginning the 1936 school year. (Wortham ISD Board minutes, July 13, 1936) By 1948, both schools had fully consolidated. Tehuancana Valley and Currie schools were added in 1939. About this same time, Harmony Hill also joined the Wortham schools. In 1941, Shanks School consolidated with Kirvin, and in 1949, Kirvin Schools consolidated with Wortham, giving a total of in the district. (Freestone County Deed Records.) When the Richland ISD closed in the late 1960s, its students were drawn into the Corsicana ISD; however, because of the location, Wortham ISD stated they would not run buses to the Richland community, but would accept any student without charge. (Wortham ISD School Board minutes, Sept. 18, 1963.) Clara Lucas Benton, 1938 graduate of Currie, stated that in 1927 a white duplex home was brought into town and served as the first grade building. This building was located on the west side of the elementary school. The first grade teachers at that time were Mrs. T. E. Longbotham and Mrs. Elizabeth Randolf Croucen. Second grade class was located on the second story of the elementary building and the third grade was downstairs. Mrs. Benton recalls sliding down the huge curving slide leading from the second story of the elementary building to the ground during fire drills. On August 1, 1939, citizens of the Wortham Independent School District voted a $6,500 bond to build a gymnasium. In 1940, the football stadium was also erected at the cost of $9,000. Native sandstone from the hills of Tehuacana, Texas, was used for both projects. Government assistance through the Public Works Administration made both these projects possible. Around 1946 there was a need for a lunchroom. A kitchen was located in the lower northwest corner of the gymnasium. (1948 The Bark, pg. 56.); The children entered the gymnasium from the south entrance and were given their lunch through serving windows. Each morning Mr. Quince Cox, custodian, set up tables and chairs on the gym floor for the students and the faculty to eat lunch. The high school study hall students hurriedly completed their assignments in order to volunteer to help Mr. Quince. At the end of lunch, the same students would help Mr. Quince take down the tables and chairs. Mr. Quince would mop the floor and have the gymnasium ready for the 2:30 p.m. high school physical education class. In 1949, a $40,000 bond was voted to make repairs to both of the school buildings. This proved to be a temporary measure because in 1955, the corner of the high school building cracked, plaster fell and the building was condemned. The students in this building completed their year of education in the Methodist Church and locations around campus. Mattie Deck Stubbs was present in the library when the plaster fell. She recalls Mrs. Nell Jolly completed teaching the year of homemaking in the concession stand of the gym, Mrs. Sadie Stubbs taught English in the bus barn, and Joe Stooksberry taught history in the boys' dressing room in the gym. The year of 1957, the citizens voted an additional $175,000 school bond. With this issue, both of the old buildings were to undergo a drastic change. The upper story of the high school building was removed. The architects dug under the building, raised the corner with jacks and poured cement in the hole with jacks in place. At this time a complete remodeling and modernization was undertaken. A new and modern one story grade school building was erected between the two older buildings. The amount of $16, 059 was used to renovate the old grammar school building by removing the top story and converting the remaining floor into a modern cafetorium. (WISD Board minutes, June 17, 1958) At this time, the school bell was removed from the tower and placed in front of the elementary as an Ex- Student Memorial. Increases in student activities and the continued success of the drama department, led to the need for a larger assembly area. In 1974, Wortham ISD accepted a $62,486.00 bid from Wortham Building and Supply Company. Using local funds, a new auditorium was built for student use. (Wortham ISD Board minutes, April 15, 1974) WISD has continued to grow and build. In order to meet needs, a bond election was held for a new high school building and, on November 23, 1985, passed 211 for and 198 against. A bid was accepted from S.C. Maxwell Co. for $624,840.00. The new high school building was completed in 1986 on the west side of the elementary building. Modernization was desperately needed for the cafetorium. In 1989, Wortham ISD School Board Members voted to use $297,089.04 of local funds to build a new cafeteria and remodel the cafetorium to be used as a kindergarten / first grade building. The bid from DSA Construction Mgr. was accepted and construction began. (Wortham ISD Board minutes, May 25, 1989.) The cafeteria is being used to feed the students from kindergarten through high school. The students of WISD were continuing to play competitive sports in the 1940 gymnasium. Universal Interscholastic League had noted on several occasions the floor was not regulation size. WISD began saving funds in order to build a new facility. Once again, using $462,731.76 of local funds and the DSA Construction Mgr., construction began on the west end of the cafeteria. (Wortham ISD Board minutes, November 16, 1993.) The new gymnasium was completed in 1994. The original building is presently being used for P.E. classes, Little Dribbler basketball games and Wortham Ex-Student activities. In the fall of 1995, a bond was passed to build a middle school wing which is located on the south end of the high school building and a new kindergarten and first grade building. Wortham High School is in a new high school that was completed the end of the 2012 school year. It is a state of the art facility, offering numerous opportunities for local students. Wortham High School has partnered with Navarro College to offer many dual credit classes as well. The community and school strive to provide quality education as they continue to prepare Wortham students to be productive, successful citizens.

Founded by Ed Iacobucci, the former leader of the IBM-Microsoft Joint OS/2 development team IBM executive and the founder of Citrix Systems, and his wife, network architect Nancy Lee Iacobucci, DayJet launched in October 2007. It was based in Delray Beach, Florida. Described by its founders as an on-demand jet taxi service, DayJet raised $61 million in venture funding, entered into a five- year agreement with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and purchased 28 passenger Eclipse 500 jets (4 and 8-seaters) at the cost of $1.5 million each before suspending operations on September 19, 2008 during the height of the 2008 financial crisis. DayJet was Eclipse Aviation's largest customer with a planned eventual delivery of 1,400 aircraft representing a majority of the estimated 2,500 Eclipse 500s on order. Its headquarters were in Delray Beach, Florida.\\"Contact Us.\\" DayJet. March 16, 2006. Retrieved on May 3, 2012. \\"1801 S. Federal Highway, Suite 100 Delray Beach, Florida 33483\\" DayJet had 239 orders for the Eclipse 500, and was expected to place 70 more by 2010. The first delivery of three Eclipse 500 aircraft took place on March 31, 2007. History =May 2008 financial problems= On 6 May 2008 DayJet announced a scaling back of its operations and the laying off of 100-160 employees in all segments of the company. The company also sold or leased out 16 of the 28 Eclipse 500s it owned. DayJet founder and CEO Ed Iacobucci indicated that the company needed an investment of US$40M at that time to reach profitability, but that the economic climate did not permit the company to raise that amount. Iacobucci stated that the company had proven that the per seat time sensitive pricing air taxi operational concept is sound, but that the carrier's fleet needed to be quickly expanded to fifty aircraft to reach profitability. Despite cutting its fleet, the air carrier announced on 21 May 2008 that they were expanding their service by making two more destinations in Florida, Jacksonville and Sarasota, into hub airports DayJet designates as \\"DayPorts\\". In July 2008 both Saint Petersburg/Clearwater and Orlando, Florida were added as hub DayPorts. =September 2008 suspension of operations= The company announced the following news on 19 September 2008: > DayJet Services, LLC, the world‚Äôs first operator of ‚ÄúPer-Seat, On-Demand‚Äù > jet service, today announced that it has ceased jet services, pending > further notice. The company today eliminated most employee positions. With > the discontinuation of jet services and cancellation of all flights, DayJet > is unable to honor any customer reservations. The company indicated that given the current economic climate in the USA it is unlikely that flying operations will be resumed. The company also announced a change in management on 19 September 2008, stating: > Iacobucci has stepped down as DayJet President and CEO but continues to > serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors. John Staten has been named > interim CEO with responsibility for managing the affairs of the company > during the next phase of operations. Staten has served as DayJet CFO and > Senior Vice President of Operations for the past six years. In November 2008, Iacobucci indicated that he was still attempting to raise capital to restart the company and that it would be a smaller, scaled back operation. He also stated at that time that there were a number of problems that caused the company to cease operations, but that the key issue was the credit crisis. In analyzing DayJet's situation Iacobucci said that problems with Eclipse had contributed, but that the Eclipse 500 was the best choice for DayJet when it was starting up due to its purchase price and projected maintenance costs. Using the Eclipse 500 also permitted DayJet to start with a single aircraft type for the whole fleet. Iacobucci indicated in November 2008 that he was still pursuing investors, but would not be committing more of his own money, having already invested US$20 million. Iacobucci did not place blame for the company's problems on the choice of the Eclipse 500, saying, \\"It‚Äôs not the flippin‚Äô airplane\\". =Sale of DayJet fleet= Eclipse Aviation announced in October 2008 that they were acting as \\"the exclusive broker\\" for the sale of the existing 28 DayJet aircraft. Canadian light aircraft fractional aircraft company OurPlane bid on the entire DayJet fleet of aircraft, offering more than \\"$500,000 each but less than $1.5 million\\" each. OurPlane operated a fleet of Cirrus SR22 aircraft and one current Eclipse 500 until its bankruptcy in October 2010. OurPlane had planned to offer its customers one-quarter shares in the Eclipse 500s for less than US$449,000. OurPlane did not complete the purchase of the DayJet fleet and the aircraft became the property of Eclipse Aerospace, the new company that purchased the assets of Eclipse Aviation from Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2009. Eclipse Aerospace indicated that they intend to upgrade and sell the aircraft.

Communities in Bay d'Espoir include: Milltown-Head of Bay d'Espoir, Morrisville, St. Alban's, St. Joseph's Cove, St. Veronica's and Miawpukek. Name The name appears in printed form with many different spellings, some of which are: Bay D' Espoir/e, Bay Despair, Bay Despoir/e, Baie D' Espoir/e, Baie Despair and Baie Despoir/e. Bay d'Espoir is often translated locally either as Bay of Hope or Bay of Despair. It is sometimes claimed that the name Bay Despair represents an English corruption of the French name Baie d'Espoir. However, the inverse may be true.Charles A. Martijn/Mikmawey The French cartographer Bellin, on his 1743 map \\"Carte de l'Isle de Terre-Neuve\\" has . It would appear therefore that the actual sequence may have been from \\"Baie du D√©sespoir\\" to the English literal translation \\"Bay Despair\\", which appears as early as 1733 on a Henry Popple map, and then to a French corruption of this, namely \\"Baie d'Espoir\\"! Contrary to the above evidence, the English name \\"Bay of Despair\\" can be found on a detailed coastline map of the south coast of Newfoundland which was hand-drawn by the world-renowned Captain James Cook (an enlarged version of the original map can currently be found on display in Bay d'Espoir). This map was made shortly after land agreements had been reached between the French and English during the mid to late 18th century. The English had acquired considerable French territory in close proximity to rich fishing grounds but with little of the coastline being well charted. Captain James Cook was hired by the English authorities to provide them with accurate, detailed maps of the coast so that they might better defend it, should the French try to reclaim it as theirs, and also with the hope that suitable sites for new settlements might be discovered. As many other place names on this map are quite clearly Anglicized versions of their original French names, such as \\"Rencontre\\" (ren-contra) being transformed into \\"Rencontre\\" (ren-counter), one might assume, then, that Cook's labeling of \\"Bay of Despair\\" is a literal, phonetic translation of the previous French title of \\"Bay d'Espoir\\". In popular culture Bay d'Espoir is the feature location of Farley Mowat's 2006 autobiography \\"Bay of Spirits\\", in which Mowat chronicles his time living on the Southwest coast of the island of Newfoundland.

It is one of the longest fresh-water races in the world with over two hundred boats entering the race each year.Morris, Julie The Port Huron to Mackinac race, May 1, 2001 Detroit News Mackinac Island Marina after the 2006 Port Huron to Mackinac Race There have been at least six changes to the course throughout the race's history. All of the race's courses start in the waters of Lower Lake Huron, north of the Blue Water Bridge near the American shoreline, traverse the length of Lake Huron, and finish in the Round Island Channel off Mackinac Island, Michigan. Currently, the Race features two courses, one Shore Course sailing up the Michigan shoreline, and a Cove Island Course that takes boats around a buoy off Cove Island in northeast Lake Huron. Both courses finish at Mackinac Island.  History  The first race was held in 1925 with the sloop Bernida skippered by Russ Pouliot winning against 12 yachts. In the 2012 race, Bernida once again raced with owner/skipper Al Declercq claiming victory in PHRF H and Overall for the Shore Course along with his crew Matthew (son), Ken and Connor Flaska, and Fred and Ward Detwiler. They finished around 1130 AM Monday. Dozens of divisions and classes of boats were added over the years. During the 1985 sail race, the whole fleet was met with bad weather. Fierce waves ripped a hole in the 35-foot yacht Tomahawk. The crew of eight abandoned ship when skipper Tom Lowry of Grosse Pointe Shores radioed a Mayday and sent up flares. They were rescued from their life boat by Charles Bayer, captain of Old Bear. Tomahawk sank 28 miles northwest of Tobermory, Ontario. Of the 305 boats entered in the 1985 race, 96 dropped out before the finish. The estimated total damage to the fleet was $500,000. Throughout the history of the race, with strict safety enforcements, Bayview prides itself on never having had a fatality. The inaugural race course was up the Michigan shore line south of Bois Blanc. Originally it was started at the same time as the Chicago Race to Mackinac with the yachts crossing the finish line from two different directions. In 1935, the course was lengthened to and required participants to round Cove Island Buoy just south of Canada's Georgian Bay. Fog created confusion and the longer course was abandoned as dangerous and slow in 1936. In 1940 the race rounded the Six Fathoms Shoal buoy for that year only. The following year the race went back to shore course but left Bois Blanc to port. In 1972 the Cove Island course was restored. Twenty years later, participating yachts were divided into two separate fleets, with one heading east to round Cove Island and the other following the original shore course. After the Canadian government's decision to decommission the Cove Island buoy in 2000, the longer course was replaced with the Southampton Course in which sailors are directed toward Southampton, Ontario and then to the finish line at Mackinac Island. In 2007, the Bayview Yacht Club announced a new course (Thunder Bay Course) in which all boats round at NOAA Weather Buoy 45003, located about northeast of Alpena, Michigan. Longer than the shore course but not quite as lengthy as the Southampton or Cove Island courses, it marked the first time in 15 years that all Port Huron to Mackinac racing yachts followed a unified course. In 2009 the race returned to the Cove Island course (rounding a private buoy), with cruising and smaller boats sailing the Thunder Bay course. In 2010 the Thunder Bay course was eliminated and the Shore Course reinstated. From 2010 to the present the two courses have been the Cove Island course and the Shore Course. In 2012 the finish line was relocated from the east end of the island off of Mission Point. Boats now finish between the Round Island Lighthouse on Round Island and a point on the shoreline located west of the main harbor. The Round Island Passage Light, which is located off the west breakwall of the harbor, was added as a mark of the course in 2012. Since 2011 the title sponsor of the race has been Bell's Brewery of Kalamazoo, Michigan and the race has been designated the Bell's Beer Bayview Mackinac Race. The July 2019 running of the race was the 95th such annual event, with 202 sailboats registered.https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2019/07/19/95th- running-race-mackinac/, 95th running of the race to Mackinac News coverage at the time indicated that the race continued over the years in spite of war and economic depression.http://www.mackinacblog.com/?p=88, 2019 Bell‚Äôs Beer Bayview Mackinac Race ‚Äì July 20 ‚Äì 23, 2019  The race  The two Port Huron race courses allow for maximum participation from yachts ranging in size from to more than .

The Port Huron to Mackinac Race is often confused with the Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac. They were held on the same weekend until 1939, when both clubs agreed to alternate the date of their Mackinac races, scheduling them a week apart. In even years the Port Huron race is first to allow participants of the Newport Bermuda Race to sail both events. The Chicago-to- Mackinac race is older, starting in 1898, and slightly longer. The Friday night before the start of the race is called Boat Night. Thousands of people: sailors and cheerful spectators, alike, line the banks of the Black River, Port Huron to view the yachts. The parties will last until well after dawn on Saturday.Family Night a/k/a Boat Night The race begins Saturday afternoon with the smallest boats starting first and the largest the last to cross the starting line. Boats typically begin finishing at Mackinac Island Sunday evening through Tuesday morning. The finish line can be viewed from a number of places including Fort Mackinac and Mission Point Resort. Boats are measured to determine handicaps. The fastest boat in the fleet is the scratch boat and has no time allowance. All other boats have time allowance handicaps which are subtracted from the elapsed sailing time. Over the years various handicapping systems have been used including CCA, IOR, PHRF, IMS, IRC and ORR. In 2016 the Cove Island course used the ORR handicap system while the shore course used PHRF. In 2017 the shore course will start using the ORR-EZ handicap system.http://www.bycmack.com Since 2009 the race has used internet tracking for all the participants. Throughout the event race fans can track the progress of the yachts. The last boat to finish the race is called the \\"pickle boat.\\" The origin of the name comes from English yachting, where the last boat was called the \\"fisher.\\" The boats used to stop to fish for herring and then pickle them. The pickling required the boat to take even longer to come into port.

Geoanna was requisitioned during World War II for service briefly with the U.S. Navy before transfer to the U.S. Army for Southwest Pacific operations. There Geoanna served as a United States Army Signal Corps communications ship with a mixed United States Army, Navy and Australian civilian crew through the New Guinea and Philippine campaigns. The ship remained in the Philippines after post war disposal. Pre War Geoanna was designed by George L. Craig and built at the Craig shipyard as hull number 155 with ownership vested in the George L. Craig Trust. Registry information shows the yacht registered with official number 234117, a gross tonnage of 122, net tonnage 90, registered length of , breadth, and depth of . Original crew was stated as five. The yacht on the 31 July 1935 trial cruise, with George Craig and nephews James G. Craig and John Craig II as well as local yachtsmen, was rigged with a Marconi mainsail and gaff-rig foresail with sail area. The yacht, with a waterline length of had a 150-horsepower auxiliary diesel engine, fuel capacity for 2,000-mile (unit type not stated) cruising radius and accommodations for ten persons. Geoanna was described as the \\"largest and most costly steel sailing yacht built on the Pacific Coast\\" in years. In 1938 Geoanna was sold to the Seven-Up Bottling Co. of Los Angeles. The yacht is shown as registered with call letters WNAP. Donald K. Washburn, president of the company, sailed the yacht in races that included the 1939 Trans-Pacific race from San Francisco to Diamond Head, Honolulu, Hawaii. Geoanna was the largest yacht in the race and was one of two yachts broadcasting daily progres by shortwave radio. When requisitioned the yacht was the property of the Seven-Up Bottling Co. of Los Angeles. The company had bought the vessel from the original owner in 1938 for $60,000 and made some updates at additional cost before requisition. Geoanna was requisitioned 1 February 1942 for war service by the United States Maritime Commission. The War Shipping Administration had set a just value of $20,000, of which $15,000 was paid. World War II On 1 February 1942 the vessel was acquired by the U.S. Navy from the Maritime Commission and placed in service 19 February 1942 as the unclassified miscellaneous vessel Geoanna (IX-61). Geoanna was never commissioned and thus never bore the USS designation. The vessel was assigned to the 11th Naval District performing miscellaneous duties for Port Director, San Pedro, California. On 2 July 1943 Geoanna was turned over to the United States Coast Guard for service as a Coast Guard operational training ship until being redelivered to the Maritime Commission by the Navy 28 August 1943. The U.S. Army acquired Geoanna on 3 September 1943 for service in the Southwest Pacific Area. That command modified the vessel as a communications ship for use by the Army Signal Corps. On 12 December 1943 the ship became part of the Army operated radio communication fleet joining the other sailing ships Volador and the previously operating, Australian registered vessels, Harold and Argosy Lamal. A crew of mixed Army, Navy and Australian civilian personnel operated these predecessors of the CP, or Command Post, ships in the Port Moresby, Woodlark and Laee-Salamau areas. Geoanna was given the Army designation of TP-249. The ship served as a communications relay during operations of the Western New Guinea campaign into the Moluccas through landings at Tacloban in the Philippines. Post war After the war in Seven-Up Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, Inc., V. United States the United States Court of Claims set the yacht's value at $30,000 when requisitioned and ordered payment of the additional $15,000.

This was initially an unintended side effect: for the first festival in 1992 the arrangers had booked Cat Rapes Dog, Poupp√©e Fabrikk and S.P.O.C.K. and about 50% of the audience that showed up was actually mostly interested in these bands since no other festival booked many synth acts. However, along with the synth bands, internationally and nationally famous rock and pop acts visit the festival every year, attracting people not only interested in synth music. In 2006, somewhere between 15000 and 16000 people visited the festival, breaking a new record in ticket sales, and confirming the festival's spot as one of the big ones in Sweden.

History and heritage Frankopan Castle The area of Novi Vinodolski is inhabited since prehistory, as witnessed by an archaeological site at Osap hill and Roman artifacts and remains such as the Lopsica fortress, found in the city itself and its vicinity. Settlement variously called Novi Grad or Novigrad (lit. New City) was built in the 13th century by the House of Frankopan who acquired the area as their possession at the time. Contemporary development of the region is witnessed by Vinodol Statute of 1288 and significant Glagolitic works of the era. Until the 17th century the city was ruled by the Principality of Krk or as a Frankopan estate. In the 16th century, Novi Vinodolski became a part of Habsburg Empire and it shares political fate of the Kingdom of Croatia and its successor states since then.

The freighter was acquired from the War Shipping Administration in May 1945. The hull classification symbol IX-208 was reserved for her, but she was never taken up on the list of naval vessels, and no classification was ever assigned to her. She was returned to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) in February 1946. Service history The ship was built at the Harlan and Hollingsworth shipyard by Bethlehem Steel at Wilmington, Delaware, laid down on 3 October 1918, and launched on 23 July 1919. She then served as a merchant ship under the name Delco. By late 1944 the ship was laid up at Mobile, Alabama, under the control of the WSA. In November 1944 she was acquired by the Navy to transport Bureau of Yards and Docks equipment to the Pacific, and then to be sunk as a breakwater. On arrival in the Pacific in early 1945 the ship was inspected and considered suitable for use as a mobile dry storage. On 28 January 1945 the Commander-in-Chief of Pacific Ocean Areas (CinCPOA) was directed to commission her as an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, assigned to ServPac. The name Domino and classification number \\"IX-208\\" were approved on 30 January 1945. However, on 23 April 1945, a Board of Inspection and Survey at Hawaii reported that the vessel was in poor condition throughout, and her acquisition was then cancelled. The hull number IX-208 was subsequently listed as \\"not acquired\\" as of 25 June 1945. The ship remained at Pearl Harbor, but was not used. She was towed back to the West Coast in January 1946 and delivered to the Maritime Commission reserve fleet at Suisun Bay on 13 February 1946, and sold for scrap on 25 July 1947.

Founded in 1970 by bel canto enthusiasts Patric Schmid and Don White, Opera Rara's recordings are internationally distributed by Warner Classics. In September 2019, Italian conductor Carlo Rizzi succeeded Sir Mark Elder as Artistic Director. History Opera Rara launched in the 1970s with a series of concerts of 19th-century operatic arias performed at the Southbank Centre, St John‚Äôs Smith Square and Wigmore Hall in London. The company presented its first complete opera - Meyerbeer‚Äôs Il crociato in Egitto - in 1972 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, marking the first performance of the opera for more than 100 years. It subsequently performed at the Bath Festival, Camden Festival (where its first staged production was Donizetti‚Äôs Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali) and Sadler‚Äôs Wells. A rise in pirated recordings broadcast by BBC Radio 3 of Opera Rara performances led to a decision to issue its own recordings. In 1978, it released its first: the world premiere studio recording of Donizetti‚Äôs Ugo, conte di Parigi starring Janet Price, Yvonne Kenny, Della Jones and Christian du Plessis. The opera itself had been reconstructed by Patric Schmid from the composer‚Äôs autograph manuscript. In July 2018 Opera Rara gave the world premiere of Donizetti's L‚ÄôAnge de Nisida in collaboration with the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. A live recording taken from those performances was released in March 2019. The score had been reconstructed over a period of eight years by Italian musicologist Candida Mantica. The first complete staging of L‚ÄôAnge de Nisida was subsequently given at the 2019 Donizetti Festival in Bergamo. The company has also performed and recorded works by other 19th-century composers, including Bellini, Massenet, Mayr, Mercadante, Meyerbeer, Pacini, Rossini and Ambroise Thomas. Under Artistic Director Sir Mark Elder (2011-2019), the company began to explore works by French composers of the same period including Gounod and Offenbach, as well as verismo operas from the turn of the 20th century. Performances In recent years, Opera Rara has given annual concert performances of operas either at London‚Äôs Barbican Centre or The Royal Festival Hall, usually preceded by a week‚Äìlong recording in the studio. The company has collaborated the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the Hall√©, Britten Sinfonia and London Philharmonic Orchestra; and with conductors David Parry, Maurizio Benini and Daniele Rustioni. Opera Rara has now worked with Royal Opera House, Covent Garden four times and in addition to past appearances at the Edinburgh International Festival, made its BBC Proms debut with Rossini's Semiramide in 2016. Opera Rara‚Äôs first international collaboration was in 2019 with the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana. Recordings Since 1970, Opera Rara has released over 100 recordings including 60 complete operas - many of which are world premiere recordings - an ‚ÄúIl Salotto‚Äù series, artist collections, highlights, anthologies and compilations. Its studio recordings have received awards from the International Opera Awards, International Classical Music Awards, Opus Klassik Awards, Edison Klassiek Awards and Oper! Awards. Over the years, Opera Rara has established close relationships with a number of singers, including Bruce Ford, Colin Lee, Della Jones, Yvonne Kenny, Jennifer Larmore and Nelly Mircioiu in the early years, and in recent years, Joyce El-Khoury, Michael Spyres, Ermonela Jaho, Albina Shagimuratova and Daniela Barcellona.

Bragg-Hawthorne equation is named after him. Life Hawthorne was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, the son of a civil engineer from Belfast. He had two younger brothers, John and Edward. He was educated at Westminster School, London, then read mathematics and engineering at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1934 with a double first. He spent two years as a graduate apprentice with Babcock & Wilcox Ltd, then went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, MA, where his research on laminar and turbulent flames earned him a ScD two years later. In 1939 he married Barbara Runkle (d. 1992, granddaughter of MIT's second President John Daniel Runkle), and they had one son and two daughters. After MIT, he returned to Babcock & Wilcox. In 1940, he joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. He was seconded from there to Power Jets Ltd at Lutterworth, where he worked with Frank Whittle on combustion chamber development for the jet engine. Building on his work on the mixing of fuel and air in flames at MIT, he derived the mixture for fast combustion; the chambers produced by his team were used in the first British jet aircraft. In 1941, he returned to Farnborough as head of the newly formed Gas Turbine Division and in 1944 he was sent for a time to Washington to work with the British Air Commission. In 1945, he became Deputy Director of Engine Research in the British Ministry of Supply before returning to America a year later as an Associate Professor of Engineering at MIT. He was appointed George Westinghouse Professor of Mechanical Engineering there at the age of 35, and in 1951 returned to Cambridge, UK as the first Hopkinson and Imperial Chemical Industries Professor of Applied Thermodynamics (1951‚Äì1980). Hawthorne's most outstanding work at Cambridge was in the understanding of loss mechanisms in turbomachinery, and during his time as Head of Department he and Professor John Horlock (later Vice-Chancellor of the Open University) established the Turbomachinery Laboratory. The oil shortage following the Suez Crisis and Hawthorne's interest in energy matters led to his invention and development of Dracone flexible barges for transporting oil, fresh water, or other liquids. (The name Dracone is allegedly a reference to Frank Herbert's Dragon in the Sea science fiction novel which featured this kind of tanker.) Hawthorne was active on many committees and advisory bodies concerned with energy matters, in particular the Advisory Council on Energy Conservation, of which he was chairman from its inception in 1974. Hawthorne was elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1955Greitzer, E. M.; Newland, D. E. (2019). \\"Sir William Rede Hawthorne. 22 May 1913‚Äî16 September 2011\\".

He became Head of the Department of Engineering in Cambridge in 1968 and was appointed Master of Churchill College, Cambridge in the same year (1968‚Äì1983). President of the Pentacle Club from 1970‚Äì1990, Hawthorne was well known for performing magic, and is remembered to this day by the kitchen staff at Churchill College as 'the man who made cheese rolls come out from behind his ears'.

Initially branded as the Cosmopolitans, the cars were later more popularly known under their model names, M2 (1970s cars), M4 (1980s cars), M6 (1990s cars). They ran on the New Haven Line (then part of Penn Central, now a part of Metro North) for most of their service life. Overview The M2 cars were built primarily by General Electric in a consortium with the Budd Company, Canadian Vickers and Avco between 1972 and 1977. They were initially branded as Cosmopolitans; both the model and brand name followed the pattern set up by the M1/M1A series (the Metropolitans) in use on the Long Island Rail Road (M1) and on Metro-North's Hudson and Harlem lines (M1A). Final assembly of the M2 cars using Budd or Vickers bodies was completed at GE's Transportation Division in Erie, Pennsylvania. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the M2 design was licensed by the MTA and ConnDOT to two other companies to produce follow-up series. Tokyu Car produced 54 M4 cars in 1987-1988, and Morrison-Knudsen produced 48 M6 cars in 1993-1995. All cars were equipped with GE 1259 DC motors with a rated output of on all axles. M2 series The M2 \\"Cosmopolitan\\" series (numbers 8400-8849) replaced EMU cars dating from the early 1920s to 1954, including the Pullman 4400-series, which were originally manufactured for (and inherited from) the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.\\"From Green MUs to M2s On The New Haven Line,\\" by Anthony Fitzherbert (World Rail Photos) As with the cousin M1 series, the M2s accompanied an overhaul of the long-neglected main line and the New Canaan Branch in which longer, high level platforms were introduced along with other infrastructure improvements. The first M2s were accepted for service on April 16, 1973. 144 base order cars were built in 1972-1974, followed by a 100-car option in 1975. These cars had been scheduled for delivery in spring 1971, but were delayed due to technical problems. Aside from the technical differences of the New Haven Line (electrification via overhead catenary instead of third rail), the cars are similar to the sister M1A order and, in times of equipment shortages or severe weather, the M2s have run on the Hudson and Harlem lines. Most of the other differences are in the interior and exterior appearance of the cars, such as red striping on the exterior rather than blue, the interior wallpaper having both the New York and Connecticut state seals and the obvious pantograph and mechanical apparatus on the roof. Both the MTA and ConnDOT purchased bar cars, but complaints from riders from stations in New York, coupled with arrival of new equipment on the Hudson and Harlem lines, led to the conversion of the ten MTA-owned bar cars to standard coaches. The ten ConnDOT-owned bar cars, which ran on express trains to New Haven, Stamford, South Norwalk and New Canaan, remained in service during weekdays until May 2014. 48 M2s were overhauled starting in 1994, with 24 returning to service in 1995. M4 series M4s in the New Haven yard After the LIRR and Hudson/Harlem lines received an updated version of the original Metropolitan series of cars in 1984-86 (the LIRR M3 and Metro-North M3A series), plans were announced for a similar undertaking on the New Haven Line. It sought additional cars to increase service on the line after projections indicated an increase in ridership. Metro-North originally planned to purchase 44 additional M2s, but decided to award a contract for 54 M4 cars (8900-series) in 1987-1988 to Tokyu Car. The change was made due to the need to accommodate additional ridership, and because of perceived improvements the M4 model. The MTA Board approved the $77.3 million contract on December 20, 1984. These cars were built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Nemko assembled and finished the cars for Mitsui, which shipped the parts made by Tokyu. In October 1986, these cars had been expected to enter service the following year. The first cars were expected to arrive in early 1987. Identical to the M2s, Tokyu Car initially gave the \\"Triplex\\" brand name to the M4 cars to highlight their being a three-car set, as opposed to the married pairs of the M2s. These cars came to be known as \\"triplets\\" by railroad personnel. During the development of the order, Metro‚ÄìNorth's operation and planning groups sought increased flexibility in the utilization of cars on the New Haven Line, and thus, decided on the triplets. The order was designed to ease maintenance and to improve reliability. The cars used fabricated bogies with air suspension, unlike previous cars in the M series.  M6 series  A retired M6 car, now located at. the New England Disaster Training Center in Windsor Locks. As part of the MTA's 1987 Capital Program, 60 additional M4s would have been ordered to accommodate increasing ridership. This number was revised down to 48 in its February 1989 amendment, with 30 to be purchased by CTDOT, and 18 by the MTA. The December 1990 amendment changed the car order to a separate contract, the M6 series cars (9000-series). Similar to the change with the proposed purchase of M2 cars, the decision was made to purchase improved models following a reassessment of fleet requirements. The contract called for 39 cars, with an option for 9 more cars, and was awarded to Morrison Knudsen in August 1990 for $91.5 million. Work was scheduled to begin 1991, and continue until early 1993. Nearly identical to the M4s, these cars were completed at Hornell, New York with body shells from Mafersa. Morrison Knudsen was the last American builder of railcars, and heavily underbid on contracts, including on this contract, to gain a large share of the market. Morrison Knudsen had almost no experience in the design of passenger railcars, and did not build a prototype for the M6. As a result, the first cars were rejected by Metro-North. In April 1995, the M6s were delayed by 18 months; only 12 cars were accepted in 1994, with the rest scheduled to be put into service in 1995. The M6s featured distinctive chimes that sounded whenever the doors were closed, a feature that did not exist on the M2s or M4s. The M6s also had black framed windows, giving them the illusion of being larger than the windows on the M2s and M4s. The M6s were also commonly referred to as \\"triplets\\". Retirement and replacement The M2s, M4s, and M6s were replaced, retired, and scrapped between 2012 and December 2018 as new M8 railcars entered service. In May 2014, Metro-North retired the bar cars, with the last one departing Grand Central Terminal on May 9. Since then, there have been several proposals to reintroduce bar cars by retrofitting the new M8 fleet.http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/newM8.html All M4/M6s were removed from service by July 2015. In November 2016, it was announced that the last 36 M2s would also be replaced by additional M8 cars beginning in 2019. The M2s were finally removed from service at the end of December 2018. The Danbury Railway Museum in Danbury, Connecticut has preserved M2 pair 8706-8707. M6 cars 9014 and 9015 were donated to the New England Disaster Training Center in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc- xpm-2012-12-24-hc-trains-for-training-1225-20121224-story.html M6 cars 9030 and 9031 were donated to the MTA K9 Police Training Center and Connecticut Air National Guard in Stormville, New York, near East Fishkill.

It was included on the re-release of Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). The song was released as the album's fourth single in 2004. Set over a hip hop-style track, it was produced by Dupri and No I.D. The song received positive reviews from critics, and has garnered awards. The single stayed on top of the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks, making it the third most- successful single from the album after \\"Yeah!\\" and \\"Burn\\", respectively. It was also ranked as the 36th biggest song of the 2000‚Äì2009 decade in the United States. The song was later remade by the smooth jazz supergroup Urban Knights, which was fronted by pianist Ramsey Lewis. Background Usher and Alicia Keys had previously collaborated with the remix of Keys' 2004 single \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", which was released in the United Kingdom. During the production of Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions, they thought of various female singers to pair him with on the song. Usher and Kortney Kaycee Leveringston's rare demo version can be found floating on the Internet. Although it was and still is widely believed that it was Beyonc√©. However, Jermaine Dupri, who co-wrote the song including Usher's number-one hits \\"Yeah!\\", \\"Burn\\", and \\"Confessions Part II\\", felt that he had established good relationship with Keys since she had worked with him and Usher. The song is written from the perspectives of Keys and Usher, who play the role of an ex- couple. For him, Usher and Keys \\"talk about how they used to be in love and how those feelings are still lingering despite the two not being involved anymore.\\" For Keys, \\"The song is talking about the first person you ever really had feelings for. Even though you move on and meet new people, you always remember that first person.\\" Release \\"My Boo\\" was not included in the final track listing of Confessions (neither were Red Light\\" or the songs Usher recorded with P. Diddy and The Neptunes). Instead, \\"My Boo\\" and \\"Red Light\\" were leaked to the Internet, along with other songs not included on the first album release. The song was included in the expanded version of Confessions, alongside \\"Red Light\\" and \\"Sweet Lies\\" (which were only released in the UK version of the album). Dupri thought of releasing \\"My Boo\\" as the fourth single from Confessions once \\"Confessions Part II\\" would be leaving the charts. LaFace Records sent \\"My Boo\\" to US contemporary hit radio on August 29, 2004\\"CHR/Top 40: Week Of: August 29, 2004,\\" R&R;: Going for Adds. and to US urban contemporary radio on August 30, 2004.\\"Urban: Week Of: August 30, 2004,\\" R&R;: Going for Adds. The single was released in the United States as a 12\\" single on September 21, 2004. It was a double A-side with \\"Confessions Part II\\" when it was released in the United Kingdom on December 28, 2004. \\"My Boo\\" was re-released in the United Kingdom on January 18, 2005. Composition and reception \\"My Boo\\" is a hip hop-tinged R&B; song with a mid-tempo melody. It is composed in the key of D minor, in common time. The lyrics are constructed in verse-chorus-chorus form. Usher starts the intro, and Keys followed her rap-intro, with background vocals from Usher. He proceeds to the first verse and chorus, leading to Keys singing another chorus, altering some of the lyrics of the original chorus to create a dialogue. Keys sings the second verse and Usher for the chorus, with background vocals from Keys. Keys repeats her version for the chorus. The song breaks with Usher and Keys singing \\"My oh, My oh, My oh, My oh, My Boo\\", one after the other. Usher repeats the chorus again, and they sing the intro of Keys. The 1977 song \\"He's All I‚Äôve Got\\" by Love Unlimited is sampled in the song The song received mixed reviews from critics. Azeem Ahmad of OMH Media proposed to ban \\"My Boo\\" because he felt that the collaboration was a competition among Usher and Alicia Keys \\"over the hip-pop like beat\\". Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone found the duet sentimental. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best R&B; Song and Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals; to which it won the latter and the former was awarded to Alicia Keys' song, \\"You Don't Know My Name\\". Usher and Keys won for Best R&B;/Soul Single by a Duo or Group during the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. In 2011, Billboard ranked the song seventh on a special The 40 Biggest Duets of All Time listing. Chart performance \\"My Boo\\" was successful in the United States, living up to the chart performances of \\"Yeah!\\", \\"Burn\\" and \\"Confessions Part II\\". The single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 twenty-nine, the highest U.S. entry among all singles released from the album. It entered the top ten, two weeks after, and peaked at number one during its eighth-week stay on the chart. The single remained on the top for six weeks, beating its predecessor \\"Confessions Part II\\", which charted at number one for two weeks. However, it failed to match the success of \\"Yeah!\\" and \\"Burn\\" for twelve- and eight-week run on the top, respectively. It stayed on the top ten for nineteen weeks, leaving the chart after twenty-six weeks. The single was successful on Billboard component charts, topping the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Ringtones. In Europe, the single had divided responses. The single reached the top five in United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. It entered the top twenty in France, Finland and Switzerland, and top thirty in Austria. Music video Usher and Alicia Keys in Times Square. Directed by both Usher and music video director Chris Robinson, \\"My Boo\\" clip was filmed in New York City. The storyline of the video is a reflection of the song's lyrics. The footage starts with Usher in a living room watching a video for \\"Bad Girl\\", a song from Confessions. The \\"Bad Girl\\" intro features Usher singing the song in a club setting while admiring a scantily-dressed woman. He turns the set off and slumps down on the sofa before laying on it with his foot propped up. After a moment of silent, nostalgic reflection, he begins to sing the intro of \\"My Boo\\". The video then shows him and Alicia Keys in their separate quarters, preparing to head out, while singing their part of the song. Usher eventually steps out on streets of New York; likewise, Keys is out in her car.

It assigns one note to all strings, e.g. E-E-e-e-e'-e' or D-D-D-D-d'-d'. The term \\"ostrich guitar\\" was coined by the Velvet Underground's Lou Reed after the pre-Velvet Underground song \\"The Ostrich\\" by Lou Reed and the Primitives, on which he first recorded using this tuning, the first known commercial composition to make use of a trivial guitar tuning. Musical theory The trivial tuning is a regular tuning based on the unison musical interval, which has zero semitones. It assigns exactly one pitch class (for example D, A, F or B) to all guitar-strings, tuned to the same note over two or three octaves. This creates an intense, chorused drone music, and interesting fingering potential. Among alternative tunings for the guitar, the trivial tuning is a regular and repetitive tuning. It is its own left-handed tuning.: Example To create a trivial D tuning from a standard guitar tuning: 1d - * downtuned to d (from e to d) 2d - * uptuned to d (from B to d) 3D - * downtuned to D (from G to D) 4D - * left at standard 5D - * uptuned to D (from A to D) 6D - * downtuned to D (from E to D) Origins The term \\"ostrich guitar\\" was coined by Lou Reed in 1965 after the song \\"The Ostrich\\" by Lou Reed and the Primitives, on which he first used this tuning.Bockris 1995, p. 80. John Cale, a collaborator with avant-garde composer La Monte Young, recognised the similarity between Reed's guitar tuning and Young's work involving drone music when he was hired to play Reed's song \\"The Ostrich\\" as part of a fabricated touring group.Bockris 1995, p. 82. Reed and Cale (who would play viola, keyboards and bass) began to collaborate and investigate the connections between ostrich tuning and drone music, as the band introduced new members (such as guitarist Sterling Morrison and percussionist Angus MacLise, another student of La Monte Young) and they became known as the Velvet Underground. Cale had composed and recorded Loop in 1964, but which became the first EP released under this band name, composed of drones played on an electric viola, and the combination of both Cale's viola and Reed's guitar tunings would be an early hallmark of their work. Reed used ostrich tunings on the 1967 album The Velvet Underground & Nico on the songs \\"Venus in Furs\\" (appearing at the end of the song) and \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\",Bockris 1995, p. 92. which also included Cale playing drones on viola. According to an interview with drummer Moe Tucker in What Goes On?, Reed's ostrich guitar was a guitar that had its frets removed, and was stolen shortly after the album sessions.

They unite to form the Daugleddau estuary and the important harbour of Milford Haven. The name of the combined estuary ‚Äì the Daugleddau ‚Äì means ‚Äúthe two Cleddaus‚Äù.Charles, B. G, The Placenames of Pembrokeshire, National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1992, Vol 1, pp. 6‚Äì7 The name Cleddau, whilst seeming to be a plural ('-au' generally denotes plurality in Welsh) comes from the Welsh word cleddyf meaning 'sword' and refers perhaps to the manner in which both rivers are incised into the landscape of Pembrokeshire.Owen, H. W. & Morgan, R. 2007 Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales Gomer Press, Ceredigion A number of former Anglican parishes in the area have been combined to form the modern Church in Wales parish of Daugleddau in the Diocese of St Davids. Eastern Cleddau The Eastern Cleddau at Blackpool Mill The Eastern Cleddau (Welsh: Cleddau Ddu meaning 'black') rises in the foothills of Mynydd Preseli at Blaencleddau in the parish of Mynachlog-ddu. It flows southwest through a broad moorland valley to Gelli Hill, where the River Syfynwy joins it. It then flows south through a deep valley past Llawhaden and becomes tidal at Canaston Bridge, the lowest crossing point. The estuary joins that of the Western Cleddau at Picton Point . Length about 34 km of which about 7 km is tidal. Western Cleddau The Western Cleddau at St Catherine's Bridge The Western Cleddau (Welsh: Cleddau Wen meaning 'white') has two branches: the eastern branch rises at Llygad Cleddau in the parish of Llanfair Nant y G√¥f, 4 km south-east of Fishguard. It flows southwest past Scleddau, and meets the western branch at Priskilly . The western branch rises at Penysgwarne in the parish of Llanreithan and flows east to Priskilly. The combined stream flows through Wolf‚Äôs Castle, where it enters the spectacular 90 m deep Treffgarne gorge, cutting through the hard volcanic rocks of Treffgarne Mountain. It then flows south to Haverfordwest, where it becomes tidal, this being the lowest bridge crossing. The tidal estuary expands into a deep ria, and unites with the Eastern Cleddau estuary at Picton Point, to form the Daugleddau estuary. Length (Penysgwarne to Picton Point) about 40 km, of which about 9 km is tidal. The Western Cleddau is an example of a misfit stream: the valley is deep, often spectacularly so, although the stream that flows in it is small. The valley was formed at the end of the last Ice Age, when the River Teifi, swollen with melt waters, was prevented from flowing into the Irish Sea by an ice dam, and flowed instead westward through the valleys of the Nyfer and Gwaun, then south along the course of the Western Cleddau. Historically, the tidal estuary enabled sea traffic to reach Haverfordwest. It was important also for the export of anthracite, which was mined on its west bank and shipped from Hook. Daugleddau Estuary and Milford Haven Cleddau Bridge viewed from Neyland The combined estuary ‚Äì the Daugleddau - from Picton Point to the Blockhouses guarding the harbour entrance, is a massive ria which is deep and wide, but sufficiently serpentine to be sheltered from high winds and rough seas, and is thus an excellent natural harbour. Because it can easily accommodate supertankers of 300,000 tonnes and more, it became from 1957 an important centre of the oil industry, with Esso, BP, Texaco, Gulf Oil and Amoco operating terminals and oil refineries. In the mid-1970s, it became briefly the UK‚Äôs second biggest port in terms of tonnage. The Daugleddau and its several tributary tidal reaches are known collectively as Milford Haven. Length (from Picton Point to the Blockhouses) about 27 km. Historically, the estuary gave seaborne access to castles such as Pembroke and Carew, allowing these to be used as depots in the Norman invasion of Ireland. It was important in the early Industrial Revolution, shipping anthracite from Llangwm, Landshipping and Crescelly, and limestone from Lawrenny and West Williamston. A small fishing industry operated from harbours such as Pill, Angle and Dale,George, Barbara J; Pembrokeshire Sea Trading Before 1900 Field Studies Journal; Pg, 5-6; Retrieved 19 January 2010 but in 1790 the building of the new town of Milford commenced,BBC South West Wales website 'A Brief History of Milford', Jon Gower Retrieved 19 January 2010 and a large herring fishery grew up based on its docks.Pembrokeshire Record Office, from 'Archives Network Wales' Retrieved 30 January 2010 In its heyday, it became the UK‚Äôs seventh largest fishing port, operating several hundred fishing trawlers, but with exhaustion of inshore fishing grounds, the docks were too small for large ocean-going trawlers, and fishing is now virtually totally non-existent. Milford was originally built for a naval dockyard, but this project was transferred in 1814 to Pembroke Dock on the opposite side of the estuary,Extract from Bartholomew, John (1887) 'Gazetteer of the British Isles' from Vision of Britain.org] Retrieved 30 January 2010 where it operated until closure in 1926. The town of Neyland, originally known as New Milford, was also purpose-built, this time by the Great Western Railway as a transatlantic shipping terminal. Its functions were largely transferred to Fishguard in the early 20th century. Ecology Both branches of the Cleddau are noteworthy for their diverse aquatic ecology that has been largely untouched by man's activities. The rivers support otter populations and a wide variety of fish species including Lampreys. Stretches of both rivers have been designated as SSSIs because they are of special interest primarily for important populations of otter Lutra lutra, bullhead Cottus gobio, river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and brook lamprey Lampetra planeri. They are also of special interest for sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus; for the range of river habitats including beds of submerged aquatic plants often dominated by water-crowfoot Ranunculus spp., as well as a variety of associated riverside habitats.Countryside Council for Wales ‚Äì Protecting Our Landscape The Cleddau rivers are also a Special Area of Conservation designated for the European bullhead (Cottus gobio), European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), Brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), Otter (Lutra lutra), Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus); rivers with floating vegetation often dominated by water-crowfoot (watercourses of plain to montane levels with the Ranunculion fluitantis and Callitricho-Batrachionvegetation); active raised bogs; and Alder woodlands on floodplains (Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior (Alno-Padion, Alnion incanae, Salicion albae)). Additionally, land around a north-eastern tributary of the Eastern Cleddau, Gweunydd Blaencleddau, is designated as a Special Area of Conservation for habitats including: calcium- rich springwater-fed fens - Alkaline fens; the southern damselfly (Coenagrion mercuriale), marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas (Eurodryas, Hypodryas) aurinia; purple moor-grass meadows - molinia meadows on calcareous, peaty or clayey-silt-laden soils (Molinion caeruleae); wet heathland with cross-leaved heath Rhostiroedd gwlyb ‚Äì Northern Atlantic wet heaths with Erica tetralix; very wet mires often identified by an unstable 'quaking' surface ‚Äì transition mires and quaking bogs; and blanket bogs.

Clearing of the land began in Goderich, Ontario in 1839 and the jail was constructed between 1839 and 1842 using stone from the Maitland River Valley and from Michigan. The octagonal jail was designed by Thomas Young, modelled after Jeremy Bentham‚Äôs Panopticon design for prison construction, common in mid-19th century Britain and North America. A temporary courtroom and Council Chambers were set up on the jail‚Äôs third floor. It was in this makeshift Council Chamber that the first Huron District Council meeting was held on February 8, 1842. The third floor was also used for church services and other public gatherings before proper buildings were available. The building served the dual purpose of jail and courthouse until the construction of the county courthouse was completed in 1856, in the centre of Goderich‚Äôs Market Square. The site ceased functioning as a jail serving Huron County in 1972 and inmates were then transferred to Walkerton and Stratford jails. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1973.Huron County Gaol, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaHuron County Gaol, National Register of Historic Places Hangings Three inmates were hung at the jail, with two of the hangings conducted publicly. On December 18, 1861 William Mahone was hung outside the jail walls. An exterior wall of the jail was the location of the last public execution that occurred in Canada, when on December 7, 1869, Nicholas Melady was hanged for the murder of his father and stepmother. Edward Jardine was hanged privately on June 16, 1911. Steven Truscott awaited execution in the Huron County Gaol from September 30, 1959, when he was convicted at age 14 of the murder of Lynne Harper, until his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment on January 22, 1960.CBC News In Depth: Steven Truscott On August 28, 2007, Truscott was acquitted of the charges.

Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released.  Gameplay  The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft's Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch, and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five stages, each made up of one to four areas, with a boss at the end of each stage.  History  Sunman compared to its earlier incarnation as a Superman title. The game features a superhero, named Sunman. He is very reminiscent of Superman with his cape, and flying abilities - furthermore, the game's title screen is similar to the Superman logo. Sunsoft's involvement with other DC Comics character licenses lead some to speculate that Sunman was intended to be a Superman game, but DC for whatever reason decided not to go along and the game had some changes made to lose the likeness. In an interview with planner/director Kenji Eno, it was confirmed that this was originally intended to be a Superman game. The game was obtained by The Lost Levels, a website that specializes in unreleased and prototype video games, from a European collector without any information on what it was. It was to much surprise that the game could be functionally played through from start to finish. The game was made available for play as a ROM for use with an NES emulator. The early, rough prototype of the ROM was also made for release on The Lost Levels, and it indeed had sprites of Superman as the original sprites for the main character, and the background music played in- game replaced with John Williams's Superman Theme. Another unreleased Sunsoft cart in the US can be made to confirm that this was indeed Superman originally, as the levels are identical to Sunman, however they are in a less finished form, and the player is able to skip levels by pausing and pressing the select button. On February 19, 2014, a ROM hack was released by a user with the pseudonym Pacnsacdave of a full Sunman to Superman NES conversion. The hack changes the title screen, cutscenes, and sprites to those of the actual Superman prototype ROM. It is unlicensed by Nintendo despite being marked as \\"Licensed by Nintendo\\" on the title screen.

When Sir Billy Butlin opened his first Butlin's in Skegness he realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned: most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Bradford ‚Äî who was engaged as an engineer, constructing the camp ‚Äî to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of icebreakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlins atmosphere was born. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Norman, and the role of Redcoat was formed. =Uniform= Redcoats with former England football player George Cohen, March 2011 To make his new army stand out, Butlin asked Norman to purchase a uniform. Norman later returned with a jacket in the camp colours of, blue, primrose yellow and white; however, Butlin found the look to be too authoritarian and decided they should wear red blazers with white lapels, and this became the Redcoat uniform. The first uniforms were made by Billie Ditchfield who became one of the first two female Redcoats (the other was Kay Berry). Over the years the uniform has changed several times, but has always retained the core component of a red blazer (despite a proposal to replace them with red jumpsuits in the 1970s). In the 1960s and 1970s, braid and badges were added to the blazers. Famous designers such as Jeff Banks and Zandra Rhodes have redesigned the uniforms. To mark Butlins' 75th anniversary, the uniform was re-designed very similar to the original design consisting of Red Blazer with dark braiding and a badge with the letters \\"BHC\\" on (standing for \\"Butlins Holiday Camps\\") and white trousers or skirt. This uniform was worn throughout 2011 for the anniversary celebration, and from early 2016 it has once again become the permanent redcoat uniform. = Recruitment and training = A female Redcoat wearing pleated white skirt, March 2011 The Redcoats undergo a tough selection process. Despite this they are still paid only minimum wage and members of the 'triple threat' cast team (such as the skyline gang) are paid more. Recruitment roadshows are held nationally on a yearly basis. In these Roadshows Prospective Redcoats have to show customer service and guest-facing skills (contrary to the popular belief that they need to be able to sing and dance, which is no longer the case). In 1999 Butlins introduced the now defunct Butlins 'Academies of Excellence' to train Redcoats. These have since been replaced with a six-week training course. There is also the option of a foundation degree in either musical theatre, or Technical Skills for the Arts and Leisure Industry. Training includes aspects of direction and production and time spent as a Butlins Redcoat counts toward membership of Equity. =Roles= Redcoats work in three areas, General duties, the Kid's Club and the costume character team. General duties are similar to those of a tour rep in a resort ‚Äì Butlins even describe the role as \\"The Original Holiday Rep\\" In the evening the Redcoats form part of the live entertainment team, starring in Gangshows and X Factor style game shows. Throughout the years, Redcoats have been expected to lead ballroom dances, stage and judge competitions, and steward theatrical performances as well as meeting and greeting guests in public areas. Redcoats run the children's clubs which provide sporting activities, competitions and arts and crafts. Each redcoat will have many different roles to fulfil in any given week. Similar staff Butlins remained the largest holiday camp chain in the UK, but smaller camps copied the redcoat style of staffing. In the 1960s, Fred Pontin adopted the Bluecoat to represent at Pontins holiday camps, and at some point, Harry Warner decided Warners' holiday camps should adopt the Greencoat. Media appearances The ITV series Redcoats was a docusoap following the lives of Redcoats at Butlins Minehead and Bognor resorts. Over three series of 30-minute episodes, it shows the selection process, the Redcoats entertaining the visitors and life behind the scenes. The series was made by Pilgrim Productions. =In fiction= The BBC television series Hi-de-Hi!, written by former Butlins employees Jimmy Perry (a Redcoat) and David Croft (summer show actor), featured the Yellowcoats as a fictional analogue. The title of the show \\"Hi-de-Hi\\" originated with Norman Bradford who claimed to have taken it from an American film; he began using this as a cheer to which the audience spontaneously responded \\"Ho-de-ho\\". Another BBC television series, Doctor Who, featured an episode entitled Delta and the Bannermen, which depicted an alien attack on the fictitious Shangri-La holiday camp (in reality the Butlins camp at Barry Island). As with the real camp, Shangri-La was staffed with Redcoats played by extras. In the film adaptation of The Who's rock opera Tommy (directed by Ken Russell) ,Tommy's stepfather Frank (portrayed by Oliver Reed ) becomes acquainted with Tommy's widowed mother ( Ann Margaret ) during his employ as a Greencoat at the fictional Bernie's Holiday Camp. Notable former Redcoats A number of entertainers have been Redcoats in the early stages of their careers. Becoming a Redcoat is seen as a way into show business, as it allows a performer to become established as a professional for the purposes of joining the Equity trade union which then allows the performer to work freely throughout the industry. In exceptional cases a Redcoat may even become notable whilst in the employment of Butlins; Stephen Mulhern notably performed on the Royal Variety Performance in 1997 whilst still working as a Redcoat, and in the past notable singers have had chart hits. Clinton Ford, for instance, reached number 27 in 1959 with \\"Old Shep\\" just after completing his final summer season at Pwllheli. However, prior to this in 1957 Russ Hamilton recorded a number 2 hit in the UK \\"We Will Make Love\\" (held off the top spot by Elvis Presley and \\"All Shook Up\\"). Shortly after this he recorded a number 4 hit in the US Billboard with the song \\"Rainbow\\", and all the time Hamilton continued to entertain Butlins guests. It was Billy Butlin himself who asked Hamilton to record \\"We Will Make Love\\" for the benefit of Butlins guests. Other artists have gone on to find success building on the skills they learned as a Redcoat, such as Des O'Connor, Jimmy Tarbuck, and Michael Barrymore. The role is an important part of the entertainment and tourism culture of the United Kingdom, and even today former Redcoats are regularly identified in the press and in books by this role even though it may only have been a small part of their career. Other famous Redcoats include Ted Rogers, a comedian best known as the presenter of the variety/game show 3-2-1, Northern Irish entertainer Jimmy Cricket, and former England international footballer Dean Ashton.

She was a very short- lived vessel, being commissioned in the months following the turning point of the Atlantic campaign and thus into a time in which many U-boats were being lost. The demise of U-470 was especially notable as she was sunk with two of her sisters in a brief mel√©e in the waters of the Western Approaches. Design German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-470 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert GU 343/38‚Äì8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-470 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and one twin C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. Service history Built by the Deutsche Werke shipyards in Kiel, U-470 took a long time to complete, not being ready for initial working-up operations until a year after her construction began. She was given to Oberleutnant zur See G√ºnther-Paul Grave, a highly experienced submarine officer, who led her through her training and mechanical trials and readied the boat for her active career, a difficult six month process. =War Patrol= U-470s only war patrol was an unlucky affair. After a difficult passage round the British Isles, U-470 received orders to join and to form a wolfpack to attack Convoy ON 206 in the Western Approaches to the English Channel. On 16 October, just 18 days after she left Bergen in Norway, a patrolling aircraft spotted U-470 with her sister boats whilst they were still a long distance from their targets. The aircraft radioed back to base, and soon a whole swarm of British Royal Air Force B-24 Liberator bombers from 59 and 120 Squadrons had descended on the trio, who decided to battle it out on the surface rather than dive, which would have made them easy targets for depth charges. =Fate= Over the course of the next several hours, the Liberators attacked the U-boats again and again, losing two of their number to anti-aircraft fire, one with all aboard and the other with two fatalities amongst the crew. The submarines, however, were suffering much worse, and gradually all three were sunk, U-470 going down with 46 hands including the captain, only two being picked up later off rafts by allied ships. The aircraft had reported 15 survivors in the water, but many of them did not find buoyancy supports and drowned over the next few hours. =Wolfpacks= U-470 took part in one wolfpack, namely. * Schlieffen (14‚Äì16 October 1943) References Bibliography   External links * Category:German Type VIIC submarines Category:World War II submarines of Germany Category:U-boats sunk by British aircraft Category:U-boats commissioned in 1943 Category:U-boats sunk in 1943 Category:1942 ships Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Category:Ships built in Kiel Category:U-boats sunk by depth charges Category:Maritime incidents in October 1943 ","title":"German submarine U-470"},{"id":"5980892","text":"Lid lag is the static situation in which the upper eyelid is higher than normal with the globe in downgaze.

Several of these regions have economies the size of small developed nations.

Each 2-by-2 binary matrix can be found within it exactly once. In combinatorial mathematics, a De Bruijn torus, named after Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn, is an array of symbols from an alphabet (often just 0 and 1) that contains every m-by-n matrix exactly once. It is a torus because the edges are considered wraparound for the purpose of finding matrices. Its name comes from the De Bruijn sequence, which can be considered a special case where n is 1 (one dimension). One of the main open questions regarding De Bruijn tori is whether a De Bruijn torus for a particular alphabet size can be constructed for a given m and n. It is known that these always exist when n = 1, since then we simply get the De Bruijn sequences, which always exist. It is also known that \\"square\\" tori exist whenever m = n and even (for the odd case the resulting tori cannot be square). The smallest possible binary \\"square\\" de Bruijn torus, depicted above right, denoted as (4,4;2,2)2 de Bruijn torus (or simply as B2), contains all 2√ó2 binary matrices. B2 Apart from \\"translation\\", \\"inversion\\" (exchanging 0s and 1s) and \\"rotation\\" (by 90 degrees), no other (4,4;2,2)2 de Bruijn tori are possible - this can be shown by complete inspection of all 216 binary matrices (or subset fulfilling constrains such as equal numbers of 0s and 1s) . Larger example: B4 of zeros and of ones at the upper margin. An example of the next possible binary \\"square\\" de Bruijn torus, (256,256;4,4)2 (abbreviated as B4), has been explicitly constructed. The image on the right shows an example of a (256,256;4,4)2 de Bruijn torus / array, where the zeros have been encoded as white and the ones as red pixels respectively. Binary de Bruijn tori of greater size The paper in which an example of the (256,256;4,4)2 de Bruijn torus was constructed contained over 10 pages of binary, despite its reduced font size, requiring three lines per row of array. The subsequent possible binary de Bruijn torus, containing all binary 6√ó6 matrices, would have 236 = 68,719,476,736 entries, yielding a square array of dimension 262,144x262,144, denoted a (262144,262144;6,6)2 de Bruijn torus or simply B6. This could easily be stored on a computerif printed with pixels of side 0.1 mm, such a matrix would require an area of approximately 26√ó26 square metre.

Biography Congdon was born in Annapolis, Nova Scotia and attended Yarmouth High School. Following graduation, he received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree from the University of Toronto in 1879 and a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree in 1883. He then attended the Inner Temple in London to study law. He was then an editorial writer for the Halifax Morning Chronicle between 1885 and 1887. In the latter year, he married Louisa Gladwyn. He then practised law and lectured at Dalhousie University. In 1898, he wrote Congdon's Digest of Nova Scotia Reports. Around the turn of the 20th century, Congdon moved to the Yukon Territory to serve as Crown Prosecutor and legal advisor to the Yukon Council. In 1903, he was appointed Commissioner. His term in office was not looked upon with a positive feeling and it was mired by corruption and controversy. He has also been blamed for the disincorporation of Dawson City in 1904. Only a year after his appointment, Congdon resigned so he could win the Yukon's seat in the House of Commons of Canada, which had been recently vacated by former Yukon Commissioner James Hamilton Ross, who left his seat when he was appointed to the Senate of Canada. A loyal Liberal Party member, Congdon was defeated for the seat in Parliament. However, he did not give up hope that he would sit in the House. He finally won the seat in 1908 in a by- election, but lost it in 1911. This would be the last and only time that Congdon would serve as Member of Parliament for the Yukon. After 1921, following yet another defeat, Congdon practised law in Toronto. He went once more for the seat, in 1926, only to suffer his last defeat. He died in Ottawa on March 13, 1932.

Neill, better known as Hoodoo Brown, was the leader of the Dodge City Gang in Las Vegas, New Mexico in 1879 and early 1880. According to Harold Thatcher, curator of the Rough Rider Museum in Las Vegas, Hoodoo was \\"the baddest cowboy of them all\\". He was described as tall and thin, with light hair, a rakish look, and a small moustache. Early life and background Neill hailed from a traditional Southern family from Lexington, Missouri. His father had come to Lexington from Lee County, Virginia in the 1830s. Hyman's father, Henry Alexander Neill, practiced law and would have joined the Confederacy when the American Civil War began, however, he decided he could not disavow his oath to support the Constitution and ended up joining the Union. This choice, coupled with his wife's death, caused him to move his family to Warrensburg, Missouri after the war. His date of birth is possibly unknown. Hoodoo became a printer's devil when he was a teenager, until one day he was asked to retrieve rags needed for printing. Young Neill jumped on a freight train going by the back door of the office, saying he was leaving to \\"get your durn rags\\". He was hunting American bison and hauling lumber in 1872. At the time, he was known to be a small-time gambler and confidence trickster. He eventually went to Colorado, working in silver mines with a friend. Hoodoo and his friend ended up in Mexico to form an opera company. Formation of the Dodge City Gang When Hoodoo arrived in Las Vegas, New Mexico, he found it was developing a reputation as a lawless place, filled with outlaws, confidence tricksters, murderers and thieves. His displeasure with this led to his election as Justice of the Peace for East Las Vegas. He also served as coroner and mayor of the town, and recruited several former gunfighters from Kansas to form a police force. However, the force was as lawless as the criminals they were supposed to be policing. Called the \\"Dodge City Gang\\", the force included J. J. Webb as the town marshal, Mysterious Dave Mather, Joe Carson, \\"Dutchy\\" Schunderberger and Dave Rudabaugh. Dodge City Gang's achievements From 1879 through 1880, Hoodoo led the Dodge City Gang on stagecoach and train robberies, murders, thievery and municipal corruption. Hoodoo's position as coroner enabled him to install the gang as the \\"Coroner's Jury\\", which they used to determine whether or not killings were in self- defense. This position enabled Hoodoo's gang to cover up most of their crimes. Arrest and disappearance By the summer of 1880, the citizens of Las Vegas, New Mexico, had had enough of Hoodoo's corruption, and organized a team of vigilantes to overthrow the mayor. Hoodoo was not killed, but instead driven from the state. Historians have stated that Hoodoo stole money from a dead man before moving on to Houston, Texas. Meanwhile, the widow of one of Hoodoo's deputies, who had been killed two months earlier, had exhumed her husband to move him to Houston. When she arrived, she found Hoodoo had been arrested. The widow visited Hoodoo in prison. The Parsons Sun reported that \\"the meeting between the pair is said to have been affecting in the extreme, and rather more affectionate than would be expected under the circumstances.\\" The Parsons Eclipse, another newspaper added that Hoodoo's specific offense committed at Las Vegas was murder and robbery, and it was indicated that seduction and adultery was connected to the crime. Soon thereafter, however, Hoodoo hired two local attorneys and was released when the attorneys managed to prove that the officers had no legal authority for holding Brown. Neither he nor the widow were ever seen again. The Chicago Times soon reported that Brown and the widow have been \\"skylarking through some of the interior towns of Kansas ever since\\". Reputed death and family Reports from a descendant of Hyman G. Neill indicate that Hoodoo died in Torre√≥n, Coahuila, Mexico, where he left a common-law wife and a son. Two of Hoodoo's brothers brought back his remains to Lexington. His son was also brought there, and was raised. Hoodoo Brown was buried at his family plot in Lexington under the name Henry G. Neill. Years later, records listed a woman named Elizabeth Brown who was living in Leadville, Colorado. A heavy drinker, she claimed to have been married to a gambler named Hoodoo Brown, who was shot and killed in a gambling dispute. She may have been Hoodoo's common law wife, but this was never proven. In popular culture In the 2005 video game Gun, Hoodoo Brown is shown as the mayor of fictional Empire City, New Mexico. He resembles the real-life Hoodoo in both appearance and character. In the game, Hoodoo deputizes the game's protagonist, Colton White, and agrees to help him find Josiah Reed, an assassin that masquerades as a preacher Colton is looking for. Colton soon finds out, however, that Hoodoo is on the same side as the assassin, and must escape Hoodoo's prison, later killing him. Dave Rudebaugh and J.J. Webb are also portrayed in the game as Hoodoo's deputies. Hoodoo is voiced by Ron Perlman in the game. Brown also appears in two stories of the Italian comic Tex Willer, episodes 601 and 602, as mayor of Vegas, New Mexico, and head of the Dodge City gang. When Tex and his fellow ranger Kit Carson discover that Brown, with appointed sheriff Dave Mather and deputies of the town, among which John Joshua Webb and Dave Rudabaugh, as Dan Rudabaugh, participated in several robberies, they are involved in a duel, and Tex and Carson manage to kill Brown. Hyman Neil appears in the weird western novel Merkabah Rider: The Mensch With No Name, by Edward M. Erdelac.Edward M. Erdelac, Merkabah Rider: The Mensch With No Name, Damnation Books, LLC, 2010. . He unofficially hires the Rider, Mysterious Dave Mather, and Doc Holliday to find two thousand dollars in cash stolen in a train robbery outside Las Vegas, New Mexico.

Portrayed by Daphne Zuniga, Jo Reynolds appeared in the first four seasons of Melrose Place. She also appeared in the pilot of \\"Models Inc.\\" (Melrose Place first spin-off) and later appeared in two episodes in the 2009 series revival. Storylines =Arrival at Melrose Place and relationship with Jake (1992-1993)= Jobeth \\"Jo\\" Reynolds comes to the Melrose Place apartment complex from New York City to escape her stormy marriage to Charles Reynolds. Afraid of exposure, she is initially unfriendly to her neighbors and hesitant to allow anyone into her personal life. Jo meets her match in gruff \\"bad boy\\" Jake Hanson, and the two begin a tempestuous romance. Alike in their passion and stubbornness, they fight and reunite repeatedly. Jo is threatened when the complex is bought by the aggressive Amanda Woodward, who has an obvious attraction to Jake. After a further series of fights and mis- communication, Jo loses Jake to the conniving Amanda. =Reed Carter, arrest for murder, pregnancy and custody battle (1993‚Äì1995)= A new love entered her life when Jo attended a high school reunion and bumped into an old high school acquaintance named Reed Carter. Soon, Jake was a distant memory as she began a seemingly great love affair with Reed. However, she discovered that Reed was secretly dealing drugs. When he found out that Jo was aware of his illegal activities, Reed kidnapped her, holding her captive in a boat he used to share business with Jake and Amanda. Reed ultimately tried to kill Jo, but she killed him in self-defense. Jo was immediately tried for the death of Reed, and almost lost it all in court. After settling down with being proven not guilty, new troubles plagued Jo. She found out a few months later she was pregnant by Reed, and wanted to get an abortion. With help from Jake, who was beginning to realize the feelings he still had for her, she got through the pregnancy. A couple of months before Jo was due to deliver, Reed's parents arrived at Melrose Place. The Carters wanted revenge on her for \\"killing their son\\" although they knew Jo shot Reed out of self-defense. Nothing Jo did would satisfy them. She tried to tell them she would settle out of court, but the Carters sued her for custody of their grandson. The Carters' attorney convinced the court that Jo was not a fit mother. In a horrifying turn of events, Jo lost the custody of her child to the Carters before it was even born. She also ended her friendship with Alison, who was supposed to testify on her behalf but showed up high on uppers in the courtroom the day she was to testify. Jo slowly began to die inside, going through depression and not feeling the work of her beloved photography job any longer, when Kimberly Shaw showed up. Shaw showed a ray of hope still survived: She was going to help Jo fake her own child's death, so that Jo could go into hiding back in New York City and raise her child there, and the Carters would never know. They even set it up with switched hospital records that would declare Jo's baby dead. Through the months preceding the due date, Kimberly and Jo were able to trick the Carters into believing their grandchild was dead. When the baby boy, whom Jo named Austin, was born, Kimberly suffered one of her imbecilic head colds, and decided to steal Jo's baby and keep it for herself. For weeks Jo struggled to prove her son was in danger, and alive, despite what the birth records stated. Once a blood test was done by Michael Mancini, Jo was revealed to be the baby's mother. After extreme pressure from Dr. Peter Burns, then Chief of Staff of Wilshire Memorial Hospital, Michael was forced to concede and set Kimberly to work on Christmas Day, and while she was gone, he gave baby Austin back to mother Jo, the perfect Christmas present. Not long after, things again became ugly for Jo. Kimberly called upon the Carters, telling them their grandson was very much alive and that she knew where he was. Jo, on the other hand, was happy and made Jake the godfather of Austin, when an unexpected nanny came to 4616 Melrose Place. All seemed perfect, this nanny was terrific and took excellent care of Austin - until she stole him and it turned out she was working for the Carters to get Austin back all along. Jake helped Jo search for her son, although all hope seemed lost. The two were finally able to track the Carters down at their lake house, and Jake swore to Jo he would get Austin back for her. The two refound the love they once had, albeit briefly. After tracking the Carters down, Jo panicked upon seeing her child in their arms, and tried to take the plunge to get her son back, but in another turn of terrifying events, she was shot by the Carters when trying to flee into Jake's arms. Taken to the hospital, Jo recuperated for a few days, when Mrs. Carter threatened Jo in the middle of the night, telling her to stay away from them. But Jo was not going down without a fight. She took the Carters back to court, and declared that if she couldn't raise her child, she wanted him to be raised by a family who could. The Carters lost little Austin, and were never going to see him again. Jo, on the other hand, would be able to see Austin again when he was eighteen. In an emotional and heartwarming moment, Jo was allowed one final moment with her son, to say goodbye. From there, Jo settled down, and took it easy, sticking with her work, and staying away from relationships. She and Jake seemed to be getting along well, and she trusted him after all he had done for her. Later, Jo along with Jake and Jane Mancini fell victim to vandalism. Rikki, who moved into 4616 Melrose with Sydney, trashed her motorcycle and committed other acts to her apartment, including stealing her cameras. However, this did not stop her career. While downtown in the rough side of town to take pictures for a huge story on night life, there, she witnessed a violent act of police brutality which led to a plethora of questions from the police concerning which one of their team committed the act. Jo cooperated, only to meet stern \\"justice\\" when the officer who committed the act of violence ripped her apartment to shreds, and would not leave her alone about keeping her mouth shut. So she went to Matt Fielding, close friend and fellow Melrose Place resident. He turned the pictures in, causing much dismay from the cop who was the murderer. This led to the cop holding Jo and Matt at gunpoint, another victimized situation, but Jo was strong again, and got the gun from the cop and stated \\"What you didn't know, is that I am tired of being the victim!\\" =Reunited with Jake (1995)= Because of all that Jake had done for her, she decided it was her turn to do something for him, by accompanying him to the funeral of his mother (who was shown in season one). There, she helped Jake deal with the trauma of the incident and took note of the stormy relationship between him and his brother Jess. She and Jake slept together again but only once. After driving home with Jake, Jo laid low for a few weeks. But things heated up again when Jess Hansen moved to Los Angeles with a sinister agenda. Jo felt his pain when Jake shut him out of his apartment at Melrose Place, so she lent him her couch and became attracted to him. Their attraction was a lightning bolt of a relationship, having sex in the alley ways behind bars, sex on bookshelves, and all the while, she was afraid to tell Jake, because it would damage their relationship. Jake eventually did find out, and wanting to protect Jo, he and his brother had a feud that ended when his brother hired men to kill him. Jo knew nothing of this. She continued her affair with Jess but kept a close watch on Jake. Jess became irrational and never let her spend time with her friends, causing her to stress the relationship. Finally, when Jess proposed to her, she told him they may have needed to take some time to really think about their relationship. This did not go well. Jess beat her up. When Jake found out, he knew that Jess wanted to steal Jo away from him the whole time and got in a fight with Jess that ended up with Jess falling to his death. Jo was shock after all this. Aside from the beating and Melrose Place being blown to bits by Kimberly Shaw, the unstable doctor who kidnapped her child, she was alone and afraid. So she and Jake made amends and became involved again. She and Jake were going very well, but her friendship with Jane was not. Jo knew that Jane was only marrying Richard Hart, a very successful designer, for money. Jo told Richard everything, tarnishing Jane's relationship with Richard and Jo's relationship with Jane. Soon after, Jake developed feelings for his new waitress, Shelley, who was Jess‚Äô ex. After finding Jake making out on a pool table with Shelley, Jo called it quits with Jake for good and ran into the arms of Richard, who willingly accepted her. For most of season four, Jo was playing second fiddle to Richard, assisting him at his company, \\"Mackenzie Hart Designs\\". Many times she was caught in the middle of public feuds between Jane and Richard, and Jake would fall into them as well, but this did not bring them back together. =Departure (1996)= Jo later dumped Richard and then put her life on hold, trying to figure out what to do next. Jake offered comfort, but not his love. She could tell he wanted to though, but the two had been through too much, and their love, could not save them this time. As she was living on \\"automatic pilot\\" for a few weeks, a friend of Sydney's, Laurie, came by 4616 Melrose Place, with her son Tyler, to stay. Sydney was not very interested in this friend anymore, and Jo, being the wonderful and kind hearted person she was, let them stay with her. When the little boy showed bruises, Jo was concerned and made sure Matt Fielding, did something about it, by going to his mentor, Dr. Dominick O'Malley. O'Malley helped the boy out and all was well with her relationship. O'Malley became, in these few days, attracted to the headstrong Jo, and so much that he had Matt set her up with him. Initially, Jo did not care for Dominick. When Matt's health was in danger, Dominick came through, and Jo realized that he was a great man. They enjoyed a happy relationship and he later proposed to Jo. At first she was taken aback, believing she had been through too many bad relationships to go on with them seriously. He told her she had not, and that if they didn't get together, then he would never be able to see her again, because he was going to Bosnia to help the orphans. Jo had never been more torn in her life, and for the first time, she knew what true love was, and that she truly loved Dominick as much as he equally loved her. Jo eventually agreed to leave L.A. with him.

Of particular interest for contemporary Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations are the repeated accusations that the U.S. government actively encouraged Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to invade Iran (proponents of this theory frequently describe the U.S. as having given Saddam a green-light), supported by a considerable amount of circumstantial evidence, but the U.S. government officially denies that any such collusion occurred, and no conclusive proof of it has been found. U.S. government support for Iraq was not a secret and was frequently discussed in open sessions of the Senate and House of Representatives. On June 9, 1992, Ted Koppel reported on ABC's Nightline that the \\"Reagan/Bush administrations permitted‚Äîand frequently encouraged‚Äîthe flow of money, agricultural credits, dual-use technology, chemicals, and weapons to Iraq.\\"Koppel, Ted. The USS Vincennes: Public War, Secret War, ABC Nightline. July 1, 1992. American views toward Iraq were not enthusiastically supportive in its conflict with Iran, and activity in assistance was largely to prevent an Iranian victory. This was encapsulated by Henry Kissinger when he remarked, \\"It's a pity they both can't lose.\\"  U.S. reaction to the conflict  The Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi meeting with President Jimmy Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski, 1977. Following the Iranian Revolution, the Carter administration continued to see Iran as a bulwark against Iraq and the Soviet Union, and therefore attempted to forge a strategic partnership with the new Interim Government of Iran under Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. \\"Acting head of the U.S. embassy in Tehran\\" Bruce Laingen realized that Iranian officials were acutely interested in U.S. intelligence on Iraq, and convinced Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Harold H. Saunders to approve an intelligence-sharing liaison with the Iranian government, culminating in an October 15, 1979 meeting between longtime Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer George W. Cave and the Iranian Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Amir-Entezam and Foreign Minister Ebrahim Yazdi. Cave told Mark J. Gasiorowski that he briefed Entezam and Yazdi on Iraqi military preparations and covert operations seemingly designed to facilitate a large-scale invasion of Iran, although no final decision had been made. (The content of Cave's briefing was corroborated by Laingen, Yazdi, Entezam, and Bazargan.) In particular, echoing a March 1979 warning from Pentagon analyst Howard Teicher regarding Iraqi designs on Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan Province, Cave pointed out that Iraq had created a front organization that could instigate unrest among Khuzestan's majority‚ÄìArab inhabitants‚Äîyet Cave emphasized that war could still be avoided if the strength of Iran's armed forces did not continue its post-revolutionary decline. Furthermore, Cave urged his Iranian interlocutors to monitor the movement of Iraqi troops with \\"the IBEX listening posts the CIA had constructed in northern Iran\\" under the Shah. Although Teicher and Cave's predictions proved accurate, they were the product of circumstantial evidence disputed internally within the U.S. government, and the significance of Cave's briefing has been debated. For example, according to Bureau of Intelligence and Research analyst Wayne White, who was not aware of the intelligence that informed Cave's briefing: \\"The Iraqi army was doing little more than continuing its well-known annual schedule of primarily battalion and brigade- level training exercises ... Very little of the Iraqi military was anywhere near the Iraqi-Iranian frontier.\\" Similarly, the head of the Iran desk at the State Department, Henry Precht, stated: \\"I had no impression at the time that anyone believed Iraq was planning a major attack although we thought that [Iraqi President] Saddam [Hussein] might be stirring up the Kurds. At the time I did not think he would take on his larger and still probably more potent neighbor.\\" On the other hand, Gasiorowski contended that \\"If Iran's leaders had acted on the information provided in Cave's briefings ... the brutal eight‚Äìyear [Iran‚ÄìIraq War] might never have occurred.\\" Iraq's invasion of Iran in September 1980 was preceded by a long period of tension between the two countries throughout 1979 and 1980, including frequent border skirmishes, calls by Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini for the Shia of Iraq to revolt against the Ba'ath Party, and allegations of Iraqi support for ethnic separatists in Iran. On June 18, 1979, U.S. charg√© d'affaires Charlie Naas asked Yazdi about the deterioration in relations; Yazdi stated he \\"does not know what might be bothering Iraq ... certainly we have done nothing to bother them.\\" Khomeini had recently condemned Iraq's arrest of Shi'ite leader Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, but Yazdi claimed this had nothing to do with any effort to export the Islamic Revolution to Iraq: Iran was merely concerned with protecting the \\"religious centers in Najaf and Karbala.\\" Nevertheless, in a subsequent conversation between Naas and Entezam it emerged that the latter was unaware of the anti-Iraq broadcasts \\"Sadegh Ghotbzadeh was sanctioning in his role as managing director of National Iranian Radio and Television.\\" Continuing to seek good relations with Iranian authorities, U.S. officials uncovered considerable evidence of Iraqi support for Kurdish rebels in Iran under the leadership of Jalal Talabani (Fatah contacts told the CIA's Beirut station that \\"Saddam Hussein himself was directly involved in supervising these operations\\"); while these rebels were not considered capable of overthrowing the Iranian government militarily, they were undermining Iranian moderates, prompting Precht to broach the possibility of meeting with Iraqi officials to persuade them that Iraq's support for the Kurds was not in its best interest. Throughout this time, Iraq's intentions toward Iran were not entirely clear, as \\"the Iraqi government was continuing to put out diplomatic feelers, unsuccessfully inviting a delegation led by Bazargan to visit Iraq in July 1979,\\" while the CIA concluded in November (despite Cave's warning the previous month) that Iraq intended \\"to settle its differences with Iran through negotiations.\\" Muhammed Dosky, \\"a Kurdistan Democratic Party representative in Washington,\\" also believed \\"Iraq's overriding goal was to persuade the new government in Tehran to live up to the conditions of the Algiers Accord ... Iraq was using Kurdish groups not out of a sense of opportunism, or as a prelude to the coming conflict, but in order to consolidate agreements made with the Shah.\\" Saddam was willing to work with Iranian moderates such as Yazdi, whom he met in Havana in October, but \\"the mass resignation of the Bazargan government\\" following the November 4th seizure of the U.S. embassy and initiation of the Iran hostage crisis‚Äîand the resulting consolidation of power under Khomeini‚Äî\\"would profoundly change Saddam's decision-making calculus.\\" While the Iraqi archives suggest that Saddam contemplated invading Iran as early as February 1979, he was deterred from doing so until July 1980, at which point \\"purges and revolutionary chaos\\" had rendered Iran grossly unprepared for the attack. Iranian leaders, including Khomeini and his successor Ali Khamenei, have long espoused a belief that the U.S. gave Saddam Hussein a \\"green light\\" to launch the invasion of Iran‚Äîsomething U.S. officials \\"have unanimously and vociferously denied.\\" Joost Hiltermann observed that a U.S. \\"green light\\" is also \\"the conventional wisdom in the Arab world.\\" In fact, Iranian suspicions that the U.S. would use Iraq to retaliate for the hostage-taking predated the invasion, as Carter noted in his diary on April 10, 1980: \\"The Iranian terrorists are making all kinds of crazy threats to kill the American hostages if they are invaded by Iraq‚Äîwhom they identify as an American puppet.\\" There are several reasons for this perception, including some circumstantial evidence. First, although the Carter administration had long been interested in rapprochement with Iraq, prior to the hostage crisis the administration's preference for Iran as the \\"strategic choice\\" effectively rendered this impossible. After the dramatic break in Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations, however, both American and Iraqi officials made a number of positive gestures towards one another, including \\"a speech by Saddam denouncing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,\\" and culminating in an April 10 statement by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David D. Newsom that \\"The United States is prepared ... to resume diplomatic relations with Iraq at any time.\\" Saddam later acknowledged that Iraq had accepted Newsom's offer \\"during the two months prior to the war between us and Iran\\" but \\"when the war started, and to avoid misinterpretation, we postponed the establishment of relations.\\" Moreover, the CIA‚Äîdesperate for intelligence on Iran‚Äîmaintained contacts with Iranian opposition figures including \\"the Shah's last Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar\\" and Gholam Ali Oveisi, who were themselves in touch with Iraqi officials and had encouraged Saddam to invade. Even though declassified documents state the U.S. \\"would not fund, assist, or guide [Bakhtiar's] movement, but [was] providing the channel as a means by which he could provide us information on his intentions and capabilities,\\" and there is no evidence either Bakhtiar or Oveisi were acting at the behest of the U.S., \\"the Iranian militants occupying the embassy found dozens of documents detailing these contacts\\"‚Äîwhich began \\"even before the hostage crisis\\"‚Äîand \\"read them extremely selectively.\\" What ultimately convinced the Iranian leadership of \\"American complicity in any Iraqi attack\\" was the July 9 Nojeh coup plot, a failed military coup d'√©tat against Khomeini funded by Iraqi intelligence through Bakhtiar (the Iraqis may have notified the Iranian authorities in advance, as they understood \\"the damage the subsequent purge would inflict on the Iranian military\\"). Bakhtiar told the plotters that the U.S. \\"had given [the coup] its blessing,\\" but \\"he was lying\\" as the U.S. \\"knew nothing about the Nojeh operation and would likely have opposed it on the grounds that it would endanger the lives of the hostages.\\" In August, Saddam made a trip to Saudi Arabia in which King Khalid \\"reportedly gave his personal blessing to the invasion and promised Saudi backing,\\" which Bryan R. Gibson commented was \\"a very significant gesture, especially in light of the closeness of American‚ÄìSaudi relations.\\" United States Secretary of State Alexander Haig told Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, that it was during this visit that \\"President Carter gave the Iraqis a green light to launch the war against Iran through [Crown Prince] Fahd,\\" as related to Haig by Fahd himself, but at a 2008 conference several academics and former U.S. officials questioned the veracity of this assertion as well as the motives of both Haig and Fahd in promulgating it.United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia James E. Akins provided an anecdote that may be related to the rumored \\"green light\\": \\"When disintegration started, and a report was prepared on this‚Äîthe economic and political and military disintegration of [Iran]‚Äîthe army had been totally purged, and the people who were taking over were young and incompetent. The implication was that the government would not last too much longer. A copy of such a report was given to the Saudis, and the Saudis were quite impressed by it, because they were deathly afraid of the government of Iran's mullahs. What the Saudis did with this report is where this narrative breaks down somewhat. There are a lot of people who believe that the Saudis gave a copy of this to Saddam. But no Saudis ever told me that it was given, and no Iraqi has ever told me that they got a copy of this report from the Saudis, although they could have. Whether they did or not, Saddam also reached the same conclusion on his own. There's no doubt about that. If he got confirmation of his conclusion from an American report, that would have made him even more determined to move against Iran.\\" See As described by Malcolm Byrne: \\"The American veterans were unanimous that no 'green light' was ever given, and that the Haig document, while intriguing on its face, leaves far too much room for interpretation to be definitive. In any event the Saudi comments did not address the various policy arguments that militated against an invasion‚Äîchiefly, the potential danger posed to the American hostages in Tehran‚Äîwhich the participants said held sway with most American officials.\\" On April 9, the Defense Intelligence Agency received information from a source considered reliable, predicting that \\"the situation is presently more critical than previously reported\\" and postulating a 50% chance Iraq would invade Iran. An April 11 CIA analysis is more blunt: \\"Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran with the aim of toppling the Khomeini regime\\"‚Äîand had \\"sought to engage the Kuwaitis to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran.\\" Available online here. Retrieved 2017-10-05. Carter himself has confirmed that fear the U.S. hostages would be executed if Iraq attacked was one reason he approved a failed rescue mission on April 24. In light of these alerts, the claims of senior Carter administration officials involved with Iran‚Äîincluding White, Naas, Precht, and head of the National Security Council (NSC)'s Iran desk Gary Sick‚Äîthat they were surprised by the invasion require some explanation. In all likelihood, these warnings went unheeded because \\"those who doubted they amounted to compelling evidence won the argument. In effect, they were right. Only in early July did U.S. observers note the movement of Iraqi assets out of garrison with war-related 'basic loads' of ammunition\\", and it was not until September 17 that the CIA indicated \\"the intensification of border clashes between Iran and Iraq has reached a point where a serious conflict is now a distinct possibility.\\" Even then, as recounted by State Department official W. Nathaniel Howell, U.S. officials remained unsure what to make of Saddam's intentions: \\"We all followed Saddam's actions and rhetoric closely but most people I knew tended to believe he was posturing.\\" When the invasion came on September 22, \\"it was unclear whether Saddam had simply fallen into a rage following a smaller skirmish.\\" White recalled: \\"The outbreak of war did, in fact, come as a surprise to most of us because a decent portion of Iraq's ground forces were still in garrison. The hasty movement of the remaining units up to the front immediately after the beginning of major hostilities was the activity that tended to nudge me toward the abrupt scenario in which Saddam ordered the attack before all military preparations had been completed.\\"This hypothesis was later confirmed by the Iraqi archives. See Thus, in the view of Chris Emery, \\"it is unlikely that the United States was ever in possession of clear evidence of Saddam's intention to invade Iran. Although the Carter administration drastically underestimated the scale of Saddam's plans, the disorganized and apparently impetuous nature of the invasion, with much of the Iraqi army still in garrison, and occurring in the context of border skirmishes and aggressive propaganda, muddied the waters for U.S. observers.\\" Once the war began, the Carter administration's policy was broadly neutral and included several actions that favored Iran, although these could also be seen as aimed primarily at preventing a wider war. While many U.S. officials were initially optimistic that limited Iraqi gains would force Iran to agree to an arms-for-hostages deal (this proved unnecessary because Iran purchased adequate arms and equipment from Syria, Libya, North Korea, the Soviet Union, and Israel), a consensus soon emerged that the war had disrupted whatever progress had been made during negotiations with Sadeq Tabatabaei. When Iraq unilaterally attempted to station MiG-23 aircraft, helicopters, and special forces in several Persian Gulf states to use for operations against Iran, \\"most made frantic attempts to dissuade the Iraqi aircraft from landing; Bahrain even physically blockaded its runways.\\" The Iraqi presence was initially tolerated in Oman (Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said \\"had been a close friend of the Shah and was probably convinced by Saddam that one decisive attack could bring the revolution down\\") and Ras al-Khaimah (which had designs on an island the Shah had seized from the United Arab Emirates in 1971), but U.S. officials were \\"horrified\\" by the prospect of a regional war, and \\"after a series of telephone conversations between the White House, Sultan Qaboos, and Sheik Saqr, the Iraqis were swiftly sent on their way.\\" Likewise, when King Hussein informed \\"U.S. ambassador to Jordan\\" Nick Veliotes that Iraq was considering the annexation of Khuzestan Province, Veliotes stated: \\"The U.S. was unalterably opposed to any efforts to dismember Iran.\\" On October 3, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski advised Carter that \\"we should actively seek new contacts with Iran to explore the possibility of helping it just enough to put sufficient pressure on Iraq to pull back from most, if not all, its current acquisitions,\\" citing the need \\"to safeguard Iran from Soviet penetration or internal disintegration.\\" The U.S. even tried, unsuccessfully, to stop the flow of weapons from Jordan to Iraq‚Äîprompting \\"Saddam to claim in December that it was supporting 'Iran's \\"aggression\\" against Iraq.'\\" Despite this, the U.S. tolerated the provision of weapons and intelligence from Egypt to Iraq, in exchange for Iraq's assistance in ending the diplomatic isolation Egypt had endured as a result of its Peace Treaty with Israel. In addition, the U.S. \\"took active steps to make sure that Iraq's ability to export [oil] through the Gulf was unimpaired and could be quickly restored after the cessation of hostilities, primarily by expediting the purchase and early placement of single point mooring buoys,\\" although this \\"had only limited effect, given the scale of Iranian retaliatory strikes.\\" Finally, \\"American AWACS planes\\" were deployed to protect Saudi Arabia at the Saudi government's request. In Emery's judgement, claims that the Reagan administration's later \\"tilt\\" in favor of Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War was merely a continuation of Carter-era policies cannot be supported by available evidence: \\"The policy that emerged was characterized by a desire to preserve all options, while trying to avoid actions that would undermine the Carter Doctrine or establish an opening for the Soviet Union. The impetus for America to adjust its policy of neutrality, and take a definitive position on which side to back, came in 1982, when the Iranian military threatened to overrun Iraq.\\" Indeed, \\"the State Department's transition team advised the incoming government\\" to avoid threatening Iran militarily or assisting the Iranian opposition, as doing so would \\"make an eventual rapprochement with Iran more difficult.\\" In Carter's own account, \\"I despised Saddam Hussein, because he attacked Iran when my hostages were being held. It was President Reagan who established diplomatic relations with Saddam Hussein after I left office.\\" Gibson averred: \\"If Washington had any foreknowledge of the invasion, logic would suggest that the timing would be postponed until after the hostages were successfully released.\\" Peter Hahn states that \\"there is no evidence to support the Iranian contention\\" that the U.S. helped instigate the conflict, finding several holes in this theory. Regardless of whether the U.S. provided any express \\"green light\\" to Saddam, Iranians continue to view the failure of the United Nations Security Council to condemn Iraq's invasion‚Äîor to recognize Iraq as the aggressor until after Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait nearly a decade later‚Äîas a form of tacit complicity in Iraq's aggression against Iran‚Äînot just on the part of the U.S., but the entire world.cf. the view of former Iranian official Seyed Hossein Mousavian:  Support  President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush work in the Oval Office of the White House, July 20, 1984. By mid-1982, the war's momentum had shifted decisively in favor of Iran, which invaded Iraq to depose Saddam's government.cf. CIA analyst Bruce Riedel recounted: \\"You just had a series of catastrophic Iraqi defeats. They had been driven out of Iran, and the Iraqi army looked like it was falling apart.\\" \\"The Reagan administration feared that Iran's army might slice through Iraq to the oilfields of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\\"; Veliotes, then \\"Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs,\\" \\"outlined a nightmare scenario in which the Iranians invade Iraq, they defeat Iraq, and then head straight for Israel, which is distracted and debilitated by its ongoing adventure in Lebanon.\\" As a result, the U.S. gradually abandoned its policy of neutrality. In February 1982, Iraq was removed from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism to ease the transfer of dual- use technology to that country. According to investigative journalist Alan Friedman, Secretary of State Alexander Haig was \\"upset at the fact that the decision had been made at the White House, even though the State Department was responsible for the list.\\" \\"I was not consulted,\\" Haig is said to have complained. In March, President Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82‚Äîseeking \\"a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East\\"‚Äîand in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: \\"The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran.\\" Pursuant to this Directive, Thomas Twetten arrived in Baghdad on July 27 to share CIA satellite imagery on Iranian troop movements with the Iraqi Mukhabarat. This was \\"the first U.S. provision of intelligence to Iraq,\\" and sparked a short- lived debate over whether Iraq would tolerate a CIA presence in the country: Mukhabarat head Barzan Tikriti told Twetten to \\"get the hell out of Iraq,\\" but Iraqi military intelligence‚Äî\\"having already drooled over it and having said repeatedly how valuable it was\\"‚Äîsubsequently informed Twetten \\"we'll continue to look at your information, and we'll assess whether it is of use to us in any way.\\" Reports of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran reached the CIA as early as 1983, but the U.S. took no action to restrain Iraq's violations of international law, failing even to alert the UN. In late 1983, Reagan selected Donald Rumsfeld as his envoy to the Middle East; Rumsfeld met Saddam in Baghdad in December 1983 and March 1984. \\"On November 26, 1984, Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations.\\" According to Teicher's 1995 affidavit and separate interviews with former Reagan and Bush administration officials, the CIA secretly directed armaments and hi-tech components to Iraq through false fronts and friendly third parties such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait, and they quietly encouraged rogue arms dealers and other private military companies to do the same: > [T]he United States actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the > Iraqis with billions of dollars of credits, by providing U.S. military > intelligence and advice to the Iraqis, and by closely monitoring third > country arms sales to Iraq to make sure that Iraq had the military weaponry > required.

Officers Say U.S. Aided Iraq in War Despite Use of Gas New York Times August 18, 2002. Lang disclosed that more than 60 officers of the Defense Intelligence Agency were secretly providing detailed information on Iranian deployments. He cautioned that the DIA \\"would have never accepted the use of chemical weapons against civilians, but the use against military objectives was seen as inevitable in the Iraqi struggle for survival.\\" The Reagan administration did not stop aiding Iraq after receiving reports affirming the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians.Pear, Robert.

Hiltermann says that when the Iraqi military turned its chemical weapons on the Kurds during the war, killing approximately 5,000 people in the town of Halabja and injuring thousands more, the Reagan administration actually sought to obscure Iraqi leadership culpability by suggesting, inaccurately, that the Iranians may have carried out the attack.Hiltermann, Joost R.

Iraq Purchased Anthrax From US Company , Vancouver Sun. October 22, 2001. The Iraqi military settled on the American Type Culture Collection strain 14578 as the exclusive strain for use as a biological weapon, according to Charles Duelfer.Duelfer, Charles. Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence on Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction , 30 September 2004, Vol 3, \\"Biological Warfare\\", p.21. On February 9, 1994, Senator Riegle delivered a report‚Äîcommonly known as the Riegle Report‚Äîin which it was stated that \\"pathogenic (meaning 'disease producing'), toxigenic (meaning 'poisonous'), and other biological research materials were exported to Iraq pursuant to application and licensing by the U.S. Department of Commerce.\\" It added: \\"These exported biological materials were not attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction.\\"U.S. Senate Banking Committee. Second Staff Report on U.S. CBW-Related Dual-Use Exports to Iraq , May 25, 1994.

In response, the United States instructed its delegate at the UN to lobby friendly representatives in support of a motion to take \\"no decision\\" on the use of chemical munitions by Iraq. If backing to obstruct the resolution could be won, then the U.S. delegation were to proceed and vote in favour of taking zero action; if support were not forthcoming, the U.S. delegate were to refrain from voting altogether. > USDEL should work to develop general Western position in support of a motion > to take \\"no decision\\" on Iranian draft resolution on use of chemical weapons > by Iraq.

Representatives of the United States argued that the UN Human Rights Commission was an \\"inappropriate forum\\" for consideration of such abuses. According to Joyce Battle, the Security Council eventually issued a \\"presidential statement\\" condemning the use of unconventional weapons \\"without naming Iraq as the offending party.\\"  Parties involved  According to Russ Baker, writing in the Columbia Journalism Review, a \\"vast network\\" based in the U.S. and elsewhere, fed Iraq's warring capabilities right up until August 1990, when Saddam invaded Kuwait. = Sarkis Soghanalian = MD 500 Defender: Iraq acquired 60 multi-role military helicopters directly from the United States in 1983. Additional helicopter sales prompted congressional opposition, forcing the Reagan administration to explore alternative ways of assisting Saddam.Alan Friedman writes that Sarkis Soghanalian, one of the most notorious arms dealers during the Cold War, procured Eastern Bloc and French origin weaponry, and brokered vast deals with Iraq, with the tacit approval of the Central Intelligence Agency. > The most prominent [arms merchant] was Sarkis Soghanalian, a Miami-based > former CIA contractor who brokered tens of billions of dollars' worth of > military hardware for Iraq during the 1980s, reporting many of his > transactions to officials in Washington.

March 2001 According to Timmerman, Soghanalian also helped the Iraqis obtain TOW anti-tank missiles, for which he was later prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice. = Banca Nazionale del Lavoro = The \\"Iraqgate\\" scandal revealed that a branch of Italy's smallest bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), in Atlanta, Georgia relied partially on U.S. taxpayer-guaranteed loans to funnel $5 billion to Iraq from 1985 to 1989. In August 1989, when FBI agents raided the Atlanta branch of BNL, branch manager Christopher Drogoul was charged with making unauthorized, clandestine, and illegal loans to Iraq ‚Äì some of which, according to his indictment, were used to purchase arms and weapons technology. According to the Financial Times, the companies involved in the scandal by shipping militarily useful technology to Iraq were Hewlett-Packard, Tektronix, and Matrix Churchill's Ohio branch. Even before the Persian Gulf War started in 1990, the Intelligencer Journal of Pennsylvania in a string of articles reported: \\"If U.S. and Iraqi troops engage in combat in the Persian Gulf, weapons technology developed in Lancaster and indirectly sold to Iraq will probably be used against U.S. forces ... And aiding in this ... technology transfer was the Iraqi-owned, British-based precision tooling firm Matrix Churchill, whose U.S. operations in Ohio were recently linked to a sophisticated Iraqi weapons procurement network.\\" \\"One entire facility, a tungsten-carbide manufacturing plant that was part of the Al Atheer complex,\\" Kenneth Timmerman informed the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \\"was blown up by the IAEA in April 1992 because it lay at the heart of the Iraqi clandestine nuclear weapons program, PC-3. Equipment for this plant appears to have been supplied by the Latrobe, Pennsylvania manufacturer, Kennametal, and by a large number of other American companies, with financing provided by the Atlanta branch of the BNL bank.\\"Timmerman, Kenneth R. \\"Testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\\", October 27, 1992. Aside from the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and ABC's Ted Koppel, the Iraq-gate story never picked up much momentum, even though the U.S. Congress became involved with the scandal. See an article by journalist William Safire, introduced into the Congressional Record by Rep. Tom Lantos. By contrast, Alcolac International, a Maryland company, transported thiodiglycol, a mustard gas precursor, to Iraq. Alcolac was successfully prosecuted for its violations of export control law. = Index of American companies = According to German daily newspaper Die Tageszeitung, which is reported to have reviewed an uncensored copy of Iraq's 11,000-page declaration to the U.N. Security Council in 2002, almost 150 foreign companies supported Saddam Hussein's WMD program. Twenty-four U.S. firms were involved in exporting materials to Baghdad.Paterson, Tony.

May 01, 2003.  Energy development and security  = Aqaba pipeline project = rightThe United States government supported the construction of new oil pipeline that would run westward from Iraq across land to the Jordanian port city of Aqaba, permitting access from the Red Sea. The Bechtel Corporation was the prime contractor for this project. Donald Rumsfeld discussed the advantages of the pipeline personally with Saddam Hussein in 1983. The Aqaba project never made it past the drawing board, however, because of its proximity to Israel, which planners insisted upon. So near to the border it would run, the Iraqi leadership feared the Israeli side could disable the pipeline at a later date, simply by \\"lobbing a few hand grenades\\" at it. = Tanker War and U.S. military involvement = The Tanker War started when Iraq attacked Iranian tankers and the oil terminal at Kharg island in 1984. Iran struck back by attacking tankers carrying Iraqi oil from Kuwait and then any tanker of the Persian Gulf states supporting Iraq. Both nations attacked oil tankers and merchant ships, including those of neutral nations, in an effort to deprive the opponent of trade. After repeated Iraqi attacks on Iran's main exporting facility on Khark Island, Iran attacked a Kuwaiti tanker near Bahrain on May 13, 1984, and a Saudi tanker in Saudi waters on May 16. Attacks on ships of noncombatant nations in the Persian Gulf sharply increased thereafter, and this phase of the war was dubbed the \\"Tanker War.\\" Lloyd's of London, a British insurance market, estimated that the Tanker War damaged 546 commercial vessels and killed about 430 civilian mariners. The largest of attacks were directed by Iran against Kuwaiti vessels, and on November 1, 1986, Kuwait formally petitioned foreign powers to protect its shipping. The Soviet Union agreed to charter tankers starting in 1987, and the United States Navy offered to provide protection for tankers flying the U.S. flag on March 7, 1987. Operation Prime Chance was a United States Special Operations Command operation intended to protect U.S.-flagged oil tankers from Iranian attack. The operation took place roughly at the same time as Operation Earnest Will, the largely Navy effort to escort the tankers through the Persian Gulf.Agusta- Bell 212 ASW: The Italian subsidiary of Bell Textron sold Iraq military helicopters fitted out for anti-submarine warfare. This deal needed, and duly received, government approval. Under international law, an attack on such ships would be treated as an attack on the U.S., allowing the U.S. to retaliate militarily. This support would protect ships headed to Iraqi ports, effectively guaranteeing Iraq's revenue stream for the duration of the war. Special Operations Forces also assisted in this effort. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment operated AH-6 helicopters from a large barge anchored at sea. A second platform was manned by Special Forces from Fort Bragg, piloting OH-58Ds. \\"These things looked extremely sinister. They were all black and bristling with antennas and had a huge round sight module about two feet in diameter stuck on a mast above the rotor blades. ... The impression you got, just looking at one of these things on the ground, was of a giant insect staring at you before you die\\", a Special Forces officer is quoted as saying. On April 14, 1988, the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts was badly damaged by an Iranian mine. U.S. forces responded with Operation Praying Mantis on April 18, the United States Navy's largest engagement of surface warships since World War II. Two Iranian ships were destroyed, killing 55 sailors in the process, and an American helicopter was shot down, killing the two pilots. A number of researchers and former military personnel contend that the United States carried out Black operations against Iranian military targets during the war. Lt. Col. Roger Charles, who worked in the Office of the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon, says the Navy used specially equipped Mark III patrol boats during the night, with the intent of luring Iranian gunboats away from territorial waters, where they could be fired upon and destroyed. \\"They took off at night and rigged up false running lights so that from a distance it would appear there was a merchant ship, which the Iranians would want to inspect.\\" Information collected from Operation Eager Glacier, a top-secret intelligence-gathering program, was also used to bomb manufacturing plants inside Iran by the CIA.  The USS Stark incident  An Iraqi jet fighter mistakenly attacked the USS Stark in May 1987, killing 37 servicemen and injuring 21. But attention in Washington was on isolating Iran; accepting Saddam's apology for the error, the White House criticized Iran's mining of international waters, and in October 1987, the U.S. attacked Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City.Peniston, Bradley. No Higher Honor: Saving the USS Samuel B. Roberts in the Persian Gulf , Naval Institute Press. 2006. = Longer term interests = In October 1989, President Bush signed NSD 26, which begins, \\"Access to Persian Gulf oil and the security of key friendly states in the area are vital to U.S. national security.\\" With respect to Iraq, the directive stated, \\"Normal relations between the United States and Iraq would serve our longer term interests and promote stability in both the Persian Gulf and the Middle East.\\"  See also  CIA activities in Iraq * International aid to combatants in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War * Iran Air Flight 655 * Iran‚ÄìContra affair * Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia proxy conflict * Iraq‚ÄìUnited States relations * Operation Staunch was created in spring 1983 by the United States State Department to stop the illicit flow of U.S. arms to Iran. * Soviet support for Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq war * Italian support for Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq war  References   Sources   Further reading  * Bryan R.

It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour. It is composed mainly of magnetite, Fe3O4, and also contains small amounts of titanium, silica, manganese, calcium and vanadium. Ironsand has a tendency to heat up in direct sunlight, causing temperatures high enough to cause minor burns. As such it forms a hazard in New Zealand at popular west-coast surf beaches such as Piha.  Occurrence  Ironsand is found worldwide. Although the iron mineral composition of the ironsand is mostly magnetite, the sand is usually mixed with other types of sand that washes downriver or ashore from mountainous or underwater deposits.Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures: Third Edition by Yoshimi Goda  World Scientific Publishing 2010 Page 604 The exact composition of the sand mixture may vary drastically even in the same geographic region. In some areas the sand may contain mostly quartz, while in others the sand may be made primarily from volcanic rock such as basalt, depending on the types of minerals along the water's path. The ironsand is typically picked up along the way from beds, veins, or inclusions of magnetite, which may originate a great distance from the sand deposits, and washed downstream or along the currents with the rest of the sand.Mineralogy of New-York by Lewis Caleb Beck  Thurloe Weed Printer 1842 Page 22 Being heavier than the other sands, it is often deposited in areas where the water experiences a sudden change in direction or speed, such as the widening of a river or where the waves ebb and flow against the shoreline.Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5 by Joseph Needham  Page 343347 The ironsand is mixed with the other sands as small grains of black or dark-blue magnetite. Sand used for mining typically had anywhere from 19% magnetite to as low as 2%. The ironsand typically had to be separated from the sand mixture. Because the magnetite is usually heavier than quartz, feldspar or other minerals, separation was usually done by washing it in sluice boxes (a method similar to gold panning but on a larger scale). Sluice separation typically yielded concentrations of magnetite ranging from 30 to 50%, depending on the type of sand and the method used. In the early 20th century a process of magnetic separation was developed that could produce concentrations as high as 70%.Dabieshan: Traditional Chinese Iron-production Techniques Practised in Southern Henan in the Twentieth Century by Donald B Wagner  Curzon Press 1985 Page 3132 Once concentrated, the magnetite grains could then be smelted into various forms of iron, but the loose, granular nature of the ore was impossible to process using common methods of iron or steel production. Thus, innovative methods of smelting the ore were developed. The magnetite grains, however, often contain other metal impurities, such as chromium, arsenic, or titanium.Graphics and Text in the Production of Technical Knowledge in China by Francesca Bray, Vera Dorofeeva-Lichtmann, Georges M√©taili√©  Koninklijke Brill Nv 2007 Page 616 Due to the nature of the sand the mining operations were rarely stationary, but frequently moved from place to place.Dabieshan: Traditional Chinese Iron-production Techniques Practised in Southern Henan in the Twentieth Century by Donald B Wagner  Curzon Press 1985 Page 3132 = Asia =  China  Donald B Wagner, an expert in ancient Chinese metallurgy, notes that attempts to trace the history of ironsand in China end with inconclusive results. One source may indicate its use as early as the Tang Dynasty (~ 700900 AD) while others seem to contradict this interpretation.Dabieshan: Traditional Chinese Iron-production Techniques Practised in Southern Henan in the Twentieth Century by Donald B Wagner  Curzon Press 1985 Page 3132 Due to wars, invasions, famines, distrust of the government, overpopulation, a rising opium epidemic, and clashes between various tongs of miners, very little information exists about the industry between the 11th and 19th centuries, until a European miner named Felix Tegengren arrived to find the Chinese industry in shambles. Tegengren notes that ironsand was sluice mined in Henan and Fujian by local farmers and smelted over charcoal fires to make tools, but it involved a lot of work thus was very expensive. It was only smelted where there was enough wood for the fires and cheaper steel was not readily available. Therefore, the material was considered to be economically unimportant in China.Graphics and Text in the Production of Technical Knowledge in China by Francesca Bray, Vera Dorofeeva- Lichtmann, Georges M√©taili√©  Koninklijke Brill Nv 2007 Page 616The Chinese in America: A History from Gold Mountain to the New Millennium by Susie Lan Cassel  Altamira Press 2002 Page 4346 However, because the mining was safe, outdoor work, it was practiced by local farmers to supplement their income wherever it was available; in the 19th century 1000 pounds of sluiced sand typically sold for the equivalent of 50 to 60 US dollars (by 2016 exchange rates ~ 9001000 dollars or 700800 euros).Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5 by Joseph Needham  Page 343347 However, in the modern age ironsand is placer mined along China's southeast coast and used for smelting steel.The Chinese in America: A History from Gold Mountain to the New Millennium by Susie Lan Cassel  Altamira Press 2002 Page 4346Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5 by Joseph Needham  Page 343347 The typical composition of this ironsand is 48.88% metallic iron, 25.84% silica, 0.232% phosphorus, and 0.052% sulfur.Dabieshan: Traditional Chinese Iron-production Techniques Practised in Southern Henan in the Twentieth Century by Donald B Wagner  Curzon Press 1985 Page 3132  Indonesia  In Indonesia, iron sand is prevalent on the south coast of Java island.  Japan  Mining was not practiced in Japan until the 7th or 8th centuries. Prior to this, all metals were imported into Japan from China and Korea.The Mining Industry of Japan During the Last Twenty Five Years, 1867-1892 by Tsunashir≈ç Wada  Director of Mining Bureau, Department of Agriculture and Commerce Japan 1893 Page 1 Deposits of iron ore were scarce in Japan, so, around the 8th century, iron-making technology developed with the use of ironsand as the raw ingredient. Because of the loose nature of the sand it was difficult to smelt in a normal bloomery, or to use in a blast furnace to make pig iron, so the Japanese developed an open-topped bloomery called a tatara. The tatara was built with a low, tub-like shape, resembling a horizontal blast-furnace, into which ironsand could be poured and contained, and smelted in stages. Unlike with other methods, the charcoal was piled on top of the sand and smelted from above, keeping it from being blown about by the blasts from the bellows. Instead of brick or stone, the tatara was made of clay so that it could simply be broken apart to extract the metal bloom. This method allowed smelting of much higher volumes of ore than other types of bloomery smelting. The ironsand in Japan comes in two forms. Masa ironsand is found mixed with quartz sand that washes down from granite mountains. The magnetite in the sand contains few impurities or other metal oxides. Masa ironsand was used for manufacturing wrought iron and steel, used in everything from tools to cookware. Ironsand was used extensively in Japan for iron production, especially for traditional Japanese swords. Akome ironsand is found mixed with sand made from an igneous rock called diorite. The magnetite in the sand contains often greater than 5% titanium dioxide, which lowers the smelting temperature. The akome ironsand is used in the tatara to make pig iron, which is then used to make items out of cast iron (nabegane). In the manufacture of steel, the akome was added to the tatara during the initial stage of smelting, acting as a binder and catalyst for steel production, upon which the masa ironsand was poured during further stages.http://www.hitachi-metals.co.jp/e/tatara/nnp0103.htmStill the Iron Age: Iron and Steel in the Modern World by Vaclav Smil  Elsevier 2016 Page 6 When smelted for pig iron, 1000 pounds of sand (~ 450 kilograms or 120 kanme) typically yielded about 200 pounds of pig iron, 20 pounds of steel, and 70 pounds of slag. When smelted for steel, 1000 pounds of sand yielded about 100 pounds of steel, 100 pounds of slag, and 90 pounds of pig iron. Slag and pig iron that were not suitable for use were then melted together to form wrought iron, of which 1000 pounds mixed produced about 500 pounds of iron.The Mining Industry of Japan During the Last Twenty Five Years, 1867-1892 by Tsunashir≈ç Wada  Director of Mining Bureau, Department of Agriculture and Commerce Japan 1893 Page 235 = Europe = Ironsand is found many places in Europe, although it was rarely used for smelting. It is often found in association with volcanic or basaltic sands. For example, it is found in Tenerife, Spain, where the magnetite grains contain a very high amount of titanium and other impurities. The typical composition is 79.2% iron oxide, 14.6% titanium dioxide, 1.6% manganese oxide, 0.8% silica and aluminum oxide, and trace amounts of chromium. It can also be found in the River Dee, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, containing 85.3% iron oxide, 9.5% titanium dioxide, 1.0% arsenic, and 1.5% silica and aluminum oxide.The Cyclop√¶dia: Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature by Abraham Rees  A. Strahan 1816 Page Mineralogy Iron-Iridium = New Zealand = Ironsand occurs extensively on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. The sand makes up a large portion of the black-sand beaches on the North Island, as well as the surrounding sea floor. The magnetite in the sand contains fairly large quantities of titanium, and is sometimes referred to as titanomagnetite. It was produced from volcanic eruptions that occurred in the Pleistocene epoch, and is formed due to the oceanic erosion of the volcanic rock which is washed ashore by the waves to form the dunes of the black beaches. The magnetite is mixed with sand made from andesite and rhyolite.Minerals Yearbook - Area Reports: International Review: 2011, Volume 3 by Interior Department, Geological Survey  USGS 2013 Page 13-48 The sand mixture typically contains 5 to 40% magnetite.New Zealand Journal of Science, Volume 22by Department of Science and Research 1979 Page 8 New Zealand had limited deposits of iron ore, but the deposits of ironsand were massive. It had been used by some early settlers to manufacture steel and pig iron, but the material could not be smelted in common bloomeries or blast furnaces.The New Zealand mining handbook by New Zealand. Mines Dept, P. Galvin  John Mackay 1906 Page 494495 A few smelting companies formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but were unable to process the ore with any economic success due to the sandy nature and high titanium content, which tended to form hard, brittle carbides in the steel. In 1939, a commission was formed to study the properties of the ore and devise a way of smelting it on an industrial scale. The commission determined that, by sintering the sand into bigger chunks or pellets, the problems of smelting the sand in a blast furnace could be eliminated.DSIR: Making Science Work for New Zealand : Themes from the History of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, 1926 1992 by Ross Galbreath  Victoria University Press 1998 Page 182 However, at that time World War Two began, and thus further development was suspended and did not resume until the late 1960s, producing the first output of steel in 1969.DSIR: Making Science Work for New Zealand : Themes from the History of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, 19261992 by Ross Galbreath  Victoria University Press 1998 Page 170200 Ironsand is placer mined from Waikato North Head. 1.2 million tonnes is used by New Zealand Steel to create steel, in a unique manufacturing process. Mining at Taharoa produces up to 4 million tonnes for export. A previous mine existed at Waipipi in South Taranaki. A proposal by Iron Ore NZ Ltd. for further ironsand mining off the coast of Taranaki faced resistance from some MƒÅori and others in 2005 in the wake of the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy. A large quantity of it is shipped to China and Japan, but by 2011 New Zealand's sole manufacturing plant was producing 650,000 metric tons of steel and iron per year.Minerals Yearbook - Area Reports: International Review: 2011, Volume 3 by Interior Department, Geological Survey  USGS 2013 Page 13-48 New Zealand is the only country to use ironsand for industrial smelting.https://nzhistory.govt.nz/steel-production-begins-at-glenbrook The typical composition of the magnetite is 82% iron oxide, 8% titanium dioxide and 8% silica; 0.015% sulfur, and 0.015% phosphorus.

The founders envisioned a national decentralized labor organization with power flowing from the bottom up. Although it was short-lived, the UCAPAWA influenced the lives of many workers and had a major impact for both women and minority workers in the union. History The United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing Allied Workers of America (or UCAPAWA) was an organization formed after the American Federation of Labor (AFL) ignored several delegate members plea to have better working conditions for farm and food processing workers. At its head stood an intense and energetic organizer named Donald Henderson who was a young economics instructor at Columbia University and a member of the Communist party. Henderson, who was also one of the founders of the People‚Äôs Congress, noted the importance this union placed on popularizing the conditions of black and Mexican American workers and organizing them as a way to improve their social and economic situation. Henderson declared that the ‚ÄúInternational Office was sufficiently concerned with the conditions facing . . . the Negro people and the Mexican and Spanish American peoples.‚Äù Henderson observed that both minority groups were deprived of civil rights, exploited to the point of starvation, kept in decayed housing, denied educational opportunities, and in Henderson‚Äôs view, ‚Äúblocked from their own cultural development.‚Äù Henderson eventually, as President of the union, established it as the agricultural arm of Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1937 after having been abandoned by the AFL.Morris, Joshua. Shortest Straw: CPUSA in Labor Organizing, Master's Thesis. Published by CSU Pomona Library, June 2010 Unable to persuade the AFL to charter an international union of agricultural workers and increasingly drawn to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) industrial union structure, Henderson and representatives from locals throughout the country met in Denver in July 1937 to form UCAPAWA, which promptly received a charter from the CIO. Part of the reason behind its founding was to address the concerns of agricultural laborers and their counterparts in packing and canning during the Great Depression. The UCAPAWA represented multi-cultural workers from Mexicans in sugar beet to black sharecroppers in Arkansas and Missouri. They were also very involved in Asian- American workers such as Filipino, Chinese and Japanese cannery workers in Washington. UCAPAWA was particularly strong among Mexican and Mexican American workers. In 1940, the San Francisco News called UCAPAWA the \\"fastest growing agricultural union in California\\", and attributed its success to its appeal to Mexican and Mexican American workers. The union was also supported by such outside organizations as the John Steinbeck Committee to Aid Agricultural Organization, the J. Lubin Society, the Spanish-speaking Peoples Congress, and on occasion, local clergy. A commitment to trade union democracy, shared by both national leaders and regular members provided the underlying philosophy for union endeavors. Some leaders of the UCAPAWA saw themselves as participants of a radical culture and political projects. When the UCAPAWA entered an affiliation the Arkansas-based Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU) there was controversy regarding political associations. Infighting between Communist party leaders and the local Socialists who served as the organization‚Äôs principal administrators, as well as personality and ideological conflicts marred the alliance from the start. According to the both the STFU and UCAPAWA differed over a fundamental issue: Whether agricultural workers could best be served by a protest organization or a trade union. STFU thought that sharecroppers and tenant farmers could not be organized because they were uneducated and too poor. The UCAPAWA disagreed and argued that agricultural workers could be taught the rudimentary procedures for running the locals and that union members had to support their own organization. Another difference between the STFU and UCAPAWA was that the STFU wanted a centralized government while the UCAPAWA believed in a more decentralized system. After the STFU departed, the UCAPAWA‚Äôs constitution guaranteed local autonomy and provided for local control of at least half of all dues collected. The STFU dispute was a turning point for UCAPAWA. Agricultural unions did not have collective bargaining rights and often faced local hostility. As a result, UCAPAWA shifted its focus from the fields to processing plants. The UCAPAWA distanced themselves further from conventional unions and organizations by representing working classes generally ignored by traditional craft affiliates. Union officers deliberately enlisted black, Mexican, Asian and female labor organizers in order to launch campaigns aimed at minorities and women. UCAPAWA was spreading their wings from fields to fisheries, canneries, processing plants and even tobacco manufacturing workers. The UCAPAWA was fast becoming one of the more influential unions in America and when the 1939 Madera Cotton Strike happened the UCAPAWA proved they were a force to be reckoned with. Besides UCAPAWA proving themselves a strong union they were also beginning to acquire a reputation as a communist party (CP). While some truly believe the demise of the UCAPAWA was caused by the involvement with the Radical Party, many members of UCAPAWA believed themselves to be more liberal than anything. The argument of whether the union leaders were supporters of Communism set off an argument between many local leaders. Vicki L. Ruiz makes a very important statement in her book She writes that ‚ÄúUCAPAWA certainly had a leftist stance, though the nature and extent of its leftist ideology will continue to be debated.‚Äù Despite their roots or political stance, the UCAPAWA had shown that it could organize the nation‚Äôs most vulnerable workers. It also showed that women and minority groups were capable of playing an important role in the labor movement. Role of women One of the most prominent roles that UCAPAWA played was in the workplace for women, especially Mexican women. Forming half of UCAPAWA‚Äôs total membership, women were not silent partners. On the contrary, they performed various services ranging from negotiating contracts to calling numbers at bingo. Women organizing women became a union hallmark. Women enthusiastically joined a labor organization that actively encouraged their involvement and offered them genuine opportunities for leadership. UCAPAWA food and tobacco locals proved successful in securing higher wages and benefits that were particularly important to women. In fact, one of the most important positions, Vice President, was filled by Dorothy Ray Healey. Left-wing labor activists like Healey were successful because they embraced the Popular Front viewpoint and represented themselves as links to ethnic communities and as advocates of racial equality. Healey was assisted by a core group of college students and Young Communist League members who worked in the plant during the summer and were actively involved in organizing. In the beginning, UCAPAWA had the financial support of the CIO, but there were hard times ahead for the newly- formed organization. UCAPAWA was one of the few labor unions that allowed women to hold positions of authority. There, they pushed for such benefits as maternity leave and equal pay, and they were on the forefront in the struggle for women's equality. By 1937, Henderson could report a membership of over 120,000 workers in more than 300 locals. By 1946, nearly nine of ten cannery contracts set the minimum wage at sixty-five cents an hour. Two thirds contained \\"equal pay for equal work\\" clauses. More importantly, three fourths provided leave of absence for pregnancy or other reasons without losing seniority. Four fifths of the agreements also included benefits as paid vacations as well as bonuses for night or swing shift work. More than half had stipulations concerning paid holidays, union input in setting piece rates, and overtime pay after forty hours per week. During the 1938 pecan-sheller's strike led by Emma Tenayuca in San Antonio, UCAPAWA president Henderson dispatched organizer Luisa Moreno to turn the local, El Nogal, into an efficient bargaining organization. Tenayuca had by then already established the Texas Pecan Shelling Workers Union, UCAPAWA Local 172. Their primary grievances put forth against the Seligmann Company were a 15% pay cut, deploring plant conditions, and unpaid homework.Morris, Joshua. Shortest Straw: CPUSA in Labor Organizing, Master's Thesis. Published by CSU Pomona Library, June 2010. Page 38 The strike, which also became violent when strikers were teargassed, ended with the recognition of the UCAPAWA local and a minimum wage for workers. Local San Antonio Police responded by attacking Tenyuaca and the UCAPAWA local leadership, arresting them and charging them with \\"Communist Agitation.\\" In 1939, UCAPAWA Vice-President Dorothy Ray Healey played an important role in unionizing workers at California Sanitary Canning Company (Cal San) in Los Angeles, who struck in August of the same year. Union members picketed the cannery, grocery stores that sold Cal San goods, and the houses of the Shapiro brothers, the plant's owners. Faced with children holding signs bearing slogans such as \\"I'm underfed because Mama is underpaid,\\" the Shapiro brothers met with negotiators and soon reached a settlement. The Cal San local became UCAPAWA's second largest, and the union's ranks grew to include the workers at several California canneries. Strikes One of the early strikes of UCAPAWA was the 1939 Madera Cotton Strike, which, despite provoking a violent reaction from the Associated Farmers, succeeded in winning a minimum wage for union members. It also served as an example of inter-ethnic solidarity, with African American, Mexican American, and White American workers all participating in the strike. In Seattle, Washington, UCAPAWA represented Filipino cannery workers from 1937 to 1947. That was a great example of UCAPAWA supporting a minority group that wad usually overlooked by bigger unions. In Texas, UCAPAWA was instrumental in unionizing and uniting workers from feed, flour, and cotton mills. At a 1938 wildcat strike of shrimp-processing plant workers, a UCAPAWA organizer was murdered on the picket line. At post-strike meetings, Dorothy Healey outlined election procedures and general union bylaws. The cannery workers who had led the strike were elected to every major post. UCAPAWA organizers Luke Hinman and Ted Rasmussen, who began an organizing drive at the California Walnut Growers' Association plant, replaced Healey. Demise In the South, the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU), which Communist UCAPAWA President Donald Henderson regarded as \\"a utopian agrarian movement,\\" became affiliated with the union. A power struggle between the groups erupted soon after the affiliation and culminated with a 1939 protest against the eviction of sharecroppers in Missouri, which was not supported by the national organization. As a result, the STFU left the union. Anticommunism was not the sole thread in the fabric of responses to UCAPAWA's organization although there were Communists in UCAPAWA. However, UCAPAWA was not a \\"communist union.\\" In 1944, UCAPAWA became the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers (FTA). In 1946, the Los Angeles local \\"collapsed under the weight of Red Scare witchhunts.\\" By 1950, the FTA had only 1,000 workers as members, and it was folded into the Distributive and Processing Workers of America.

The Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) had planned to lay track from the north end of the New Westminster Bridge and cross the Fraser at the 1931 location. However, when the CNoR opened the Lulu Island branch line in 1917, it connected with the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) Queensborough terminus. Since the original BCER Queensborough bridge was designed for trams, not heavy locomotives, the CNoR westward route to Steveston was an isolated branch line. After the CNR absorption of the bankrupt CNoR, the money-losing branch, and damage to trestles from a 1918 muskeg fire at Mile 4, terminated all services. In July 1930, work began on sinking piers for the 4,200-foot-long bridge with a 240-foot central span. On completion in November 1931, work trains carried the steel rails across the bridge to lay of track for the Lulu Island industrial branch line. This comprised two north-south lines from west of the new bridge to connect with the remnants of the original east-west line at the south arm, with a scheduled completion date for the $2m project before yearend.

The FTA sought to further organize cannery units and realized the best way to do this would be through organizing women and immigrant workers and in 1945 started finding success to these ends. The FTA started to experience problems when the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) began interfering in its organizing efforts. The IBT was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the FTA was affiliated with its rival, the radical, Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The IBT union was more conservative in regards to women and immigrant workers. It did not have much interest in integrating them into the union. It was far more concerned with making sweetheart deals and collecting union dues. This willingness to maintain the status quo made the IBT a favorite among California Processors and growers. This meant that they signed more contracts with processors and growers than the FTA, which ultimately undermined the more radical FTA union. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 further damaged the FTA. This act stated that American labor unions could not have communist ties and the FTA had many. Because of this act many of the organizers either left the union or were deported. It was at this time that the FTA as a whole was expelled from the CIO. This put the IBT in the center of the California cannery industry and it remained there for the next two decades. Communism and Anti-Communism The Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers (FTA) have had constant ideological and political battles between the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). A lot of what caused this constant friction was that the FTA had a lot of members who were involved with various communist parties and/or organizations. More importantly, \\"The real active Communist Party leaders within the union.\\" The most prominent active Communist Party members within the FTA included Theodosia Simpson, Velma Hopkins, Viola Brown, Moranda Smith, Christine Gardner, Robert Black, Clark Sheppard, John Henry Miller, Jethro Dunlap, and Vivian Bruce. The anti-communist sentiment of not only the more conservative/liberal labor unions, but the national community at large felt that the \\"Communist Inspired\\" militant party members prevented settlements at the time of negotiations. The general sentiment perceived that the tactics the Communist Party members of the FTA used would \\"lead to trouble and possibly to race rioting.\\" Phillip Murray President of the CIO had held strong anti-communist political and theoretical beliefs, but even he himself was convinced that \\"anti-Communism played into the hands of labor‚Äôs enemies.\\" Phillip Murray held and shared many of the core beliefs that members of the Communist Party in the FTA and the FTA in general agreed to. Some of those beliefs included, \\"continued cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union, and he was committed to maintaining the CIO as an inclusive federation of politically diverse industrial unions.\\" Despite having conflict with the FTA, Murray felt that organizing against labor‚Äôs enemies was more beneficial to workers as opposed to focusing energy fighting against the FTA whose political and tactics mirrored those of the Communist Party. Interracialism At a time when big labor unions were racially prejudiced, the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers (FTA) took a stance of organizing community members of racial backgrounds. African American and Black members of the FTA held high ethics of racial pride and had held a strong foundation of solidarity that transcended the boundaries of race. For African American/Black members of the FTA, the black church had played a huge influence on their politics of interracialism. The black church held the belief \\"whites would cast off the sin of racism and embrace the brotherhood of all people, in part by the secular radicalism of a left-led union, and in part by popular anticolonialism.\\" Organizers of FTA and local black and white leaders were diligent in seeking to break down any racial barriers that would prevent class solidarity from prospering. In 1944, the FTA had found themselves on the tail end of a controversial issue that had arisen in a court hearing that had to do with the contract negotiations between Reynolds and Local 22. White workers in the Employees Association were involved in a shouting match that broke out between union leaders, which ultimately resulted in William Deberry being charged with assaulting a white woman. This caused problems for the FTA because the public had predicted that FTA‚Äôs principles of \\"race mixing\\" would lead to violence and violation. Operation Dixie Beginning in 1946, in an effort to organize the largely unorganized south, CIO officials began what is called Operation Dixie. This was done for multiple reasons, the first being it sought to organize the Southern textile industry in order to close the wage gap that existed between the North and South stopping the potential flight risk from the North due to the cheap, organized labor that was available in the South. Second, this effort was also an assault on the Bourbons who until then had been the ruling southern power. To start CIO flooded the streets with 200 organizes in what was called the \\"Holy Crusade\\" of organizing. This movement quickly inspired the AFL to engage in the same organizing efforts beginning a competition between the two groups. Out of fear that it could potentially lose some of its less radical unions the FTA joined the organizing efforts. The FTA was a vital part of Operation Dixie and its effects can be seen by what it accomplished in North Carolina where they won 25 elections against the AFL. This was despite the fact that this organizing was done in the midst of a Jim Crow south. In the end, it was the Jim Crow laws and the resulting racial strife that contributed to the defeat of this campaign.

Originally commissioned during the World War II, it flew the Brewster F2A-3, and after reconstitution in 1943, the F4U Corsair. The squadron, also known as the ‚ÄúFighting Falcons‚Äù, is most notable for its actions on June 4, 1942, during the Battle of Midway, which resulted in 23 members of the squadron, many posthumously, being awarded the Navy Cross for their actions in combat. VMF-221 ended World War II with 185 air-to-air victories, the second most of any Marine Fighting Squadron in the war. History =Organization= NAS North Island, October 1941. Survivors of the Battle of Midway at Ewa Mooring Mast Field, Oahu on 22 June 1942. From left to right: Capt Marion E. Carl, Capt Kirk Armistead, Maj Raymond Scollin (of Marine Air Group 22), Capt Herbert T. Merrill, 2nd Lt Charles M. Kunz, 2nd Lt Charles S. Hughes, 2nd Lt Hyde Phillips, Capt Philip R. White, and 2nd Lt Roy A. Corry, Jr. VMF-221 was formed on July 11, 1941 in San Diego, California. In December of that year, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, they moved to Marine Corps Air Station Ewa in Hawaii. On December 25, 1941, fourteen Brewster F2A-3's landed on Midway Island after launching from the . They were originally part of a relief force bound for Wake Island, but were diverted to Midway instead after the force was controversially recalled on 22 December 1941, Wake Island fell on the following day. On March 1, 1942, VMF-221, VMF-222, VMSB-241, and their headquarters units formed Marine Aircraft Group 22 commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ira L. Kimes. The squadron‚Äôs first taste of combat came on March 10, 1942, when four of its pilots recorded the first aerial victory flying F2A-3's downing an enemy Kawanishi H8K \\"Emily\\" flying boat. By late May, the squadron had been augmented with the arrival of additional aircraft. VMF-221 had 21 F2A-3's and 7 Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats, all of which were essentially worn out \\"hand-me-down\\" from the Navy. Leadership of the squadron was passed to Major Floyd B. Parks, with Kimes taking command of Marine Air Group 22. Much has been written of the inferiority of the Brewster fighter, particularly with regard to the Midway engagement. Many of Park's pilots, fresh from flight training Stateside, had very little operational experience. This fact, combined with the overwhelming size and disposition of the Japanese force posed against the atoll's defenses, would have more bearing on the outcome than the operational capabilities of the F2A. =Battle of Midway= On June 4, 1942, during the Battle of Midway, the pilots of VMF-221 were alerted to intercept the incoming formation of Japanese bombers and the 36 escorting Zero fighters that were headed towards the island. Parks led his squadron against the inbound Japanese armada, which combined air groups from Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, and Soryu. In the lead were the level bombers, a \\"vee of vees\\" made up of Nakajima B5N \\"Kates\\", followed by the dive bomber formation of Aichi D3A \\"Vals\\" at a slightly higher altitude. The fighter escort was \\"stepped-up\\" behind the dive bombers, this disposition gave the pilots of VMF-221 a clear shot at the bombers for the first few passes. Once the Zeros were able to engage the Marine fighters, the tables were effectively turned. When the smoke of the battle cleared, fourteen of the squadron's aviators, including Parks, had been killed in action; four more had been wounded. Only two of VMF-221's remaining 13 aircraft were serviceable, effectively eliminating the squadron as a viable combat unit. Four of the squadron's ordnancemen were also killed when a Japanese bomb stuck the ammunition area near the airstrip at Midway. For their actions during the Battle, the squadron, as a component of MAG-22, also received a Presidential Unit Citation. \\"For conspicuous courage and heroism in combat at Midway Island during June 1942. Outnumbered five to one, Marine Aircraft Group 22 boldly intercepted a heavily escorted enemy bombing force, disrupting their attack and preventing serious damage to island installations. Operating with half of their dive-bomber's obsolete and in poor mechanical conditions, which necessitated vulnerable glide bombing tactics, they succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on Japanese surface units of a large enemy task force. The skill and gallant perseverance of flight and ground personnel of Marine Aircraft Group 22, fighting under tremendously adverse and dangerous conditions were essential factors in the unyielding defense of Midway. Two VMF-221 aviators would later become aces during the course of the war. 2nd Lt Charles M. Kunz, who had flown a Brewster F2A in Capt Kirk Armistead's division, was later assigned to VMF-224; he would end the war with 8 confirmed aerial victories. Capt Marion E. Carl, who piloted a Grumman F4F Wildcat at Midway, would later fly with VMF-223, running his score to 18.5 kills. =Rest of the War= Following the Battle of Midway, the squadron was transferred back to Ewa and was one of three Marine fighting squadrons that made up Marine Air Group 21. As new pilots arrived in Hawaii and additional aircraft became available, the squadron was slowly rebuilt. In January 1943, MAG-21 was notified for deployment and the three squadrons were loaded aboard the USS Nassau and transported to Espiritu Santo. Upon arrival, VMF-214 and VMF-221 sent detachments to Guadalcanal, but VMF-213 was held back and selected to become one of the first squadrons to be equipped with the F4U Corsair. Most of VMF-221's tour at Guadalcanal consisted of combat air patrols over Guadalcanal, but the large raid on April 1, 1943, resulted in Lt James Swett's Medal of Honor action. After transition to the F4U-1, VMF-221 supported operations during the Battle of Guadalcanal, while also striking Japanese shipping in the vicinity of Bougainville. During the landing on the first day of the Battle of New Georgia, VMF-221 pilots got credit for shooting down 16 Japanese aircraft.Sherrod History of Marine Aviation in WWII, p. 147-8. In December 1943, they were sent back to the states for another reorganization. Their final combat deployment was from January 24, 1945 to June 6, 1945, aboard the USS Bunker Hill. =Reserve years= VMF-221 was recommissioned on April 1, 1946 as part of the Marine Corps Reserve.

Mustang was incorporated in 1988, became a public corporation (NASDAQ ticker symbol MSTG) in 1995, and was finally merged into Quintus Corporation in 2000. Mustang's first software products were sold using the shareware model. As the company grew, the products were soon migrated to shrinkware. During the rise of the Internet and electronic software distribution, Mustang stopped distributing physical products and instead sold licenses to its software. Major Products =Wildcat! BBS= For most of its lifetime, Mustang's flagship product was Wildcat! BBS. Wildcat! was a bulletin board system that computer users could dial into using a modem, and communicate with other users online. Initially, only one user could be dialed into the system at one time, but technological advances later allowed more than one user to be online simultaneously and to interact with one another. The first versions of Wildcat! ran on the DOS platform. In the mid-1990s, Mustang developed a new version called WINServer that ran on 32-bit Windows platforms. Wildcat! was sold to Santronics Software, Inc. in 1998Press Release: Santronics Software announces the purchase of Mustang Software‚Äôs Wildcat! BBS product line. November 18, 1998. Retrieved April 14, 2013 as Mustang wanted to concentrate on its new software products. =Qmodem Pro= Mustang bought Qmodem from The Forbin Project in 1992 and renamed it to Qmodem Pro. Qmodem Pro was a DOS-based communications program, intended for use by computer users to dial into BBS systems. Mustang developed versions of Qmodem Pro for 16-bit and 32-bit version of Windows. Support for RIP was added in 1993. Qmodem Pro continued to be sold by Mustang through 2000, and the rights to it were purchased by Quintus. Its status is now abandonware. =Internet Message Center= Mustang developed Mustang Software in 1997 in response to the drop in the bulletin board system market due to the rise of the Internet. Internet Message Center, or IMC as it was known, was designed to handle incoming corporate email. The email was filtered, sorted, tracked, and distributed to agents (people who would respond to the email). Agent responses would be routed back through IMC so a complete history of email conversations with a customer could be recorded. IMC also provided reporting features to analyze email performance. The rights to IMC were purchased by Quintus in 2000. Its status is now abandonware.

U-844 was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight. Service history Built by the large DeSchiMAG AG Weser shipyards in Bremen, U-844 was rapidly completed and readied for service, her entire building program taking just under a year. Given to Oberleutnant zur See G√ºnther M√∂ller, she passed her initial working-up and training schedule well, and was dispatched to her first patrol in the Atlantic Ocean in the first week of October 1943 to try to stem the terrible losses being incurred by U-boats at this time. =War Patrol= Ten days after her departure whilst she sailed south of Iceland she received orders to attach herself to and and to proceed southwards to attack Convoy ON 206 in the North Atlantic. The boats had to travel on the surface to have any hope of reaching their target, and it was this which caused disaster, as the three submarines were spotted in broad daylight by a RAF B-24 Liberator aircraft, which rapidly called allies in the form of more Liberators from 59 Squadron and 86 Squadron Royal Air Force amongst other forces. =Fate= During the day-long battle which followed, the anti-aircraft weapons of the boats were brought into use, downing two Liberators and killing a number of crewmen. It was not however enough to stave off the inevitable, and one by one the boats were separated and sunk, having been prevented from diving by constant attention from Allied aircraft. U-844 was eventually lost to a direct hit from a bomb dropped by a Liberator, the boat blowing to pieces and killing all 53 of her crew. =Wolfpacks= U-844 took part in one wolfpack, namely. * Schlieffen (16 October 1943) References Bibliography  * External links Category:German Type IX submarines Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Category:World War II submarines of Germany Category:U-boats sunk by British aircraft Category:U-boats commissioned in 1943 Category:1942 ships Category:U-boats sunk in 1943 Category:Ships built in Bremen (state) Category:Ships lost with all hands Category:Maritime incidents in October 1943 ","title":"German submarine U-844"},{"id":"5981248","text":"David Beland (October 23, 1886 - February 21, 1924) was a Canadian athlete.

Later in P&O; service she sailed for New Zealand, and in 1938 she was chartered to a P&O; subsidiary, the New Zealand Shipping Company, as SS Rimutaka. Mongolia In 1950 she was sold to become the SS Europa, carrying immigrants to the United States from Europe; later, she became a Bahamas cruise ship, the SS Nassau. Its final incarnation was under a Mexican flag as a Los Angeles to Acapulco cruise liner, SS Acapulco, making her the only ocean liner to ever fly the Mexican flag. The ship was scrapped in 1964. Mongolia, 1922‚Äì38 The P&O; ordered Mongolia from Sir W G Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. Ltd. of Newcastle upon Tyne on 22 November 1918, but construction was delayed by postwar refits of existing ships and she was not launched until 24 August 1922. After fitting out and sea trials the Mongolia was delivered to P&O; on 26 April 1923. The ship cost an estimated ¬£1 million. She left London on her maiden voyage to Sydney on 11 May 1923 on what was at first a 4-weekly mail service, that service being increased to fortnightly from 1925. She was converted to oil fuel in 1928. Notable incidents included a collision on 16 July 1933 with the tanker and a breakwater in Copenhagen, followed by running aground; and a collision with off Marseille on 3 December 1936. She was laid up for sale in 1937. She was captained by Harry Ramsey Rhodes for 9 years. Rimutaka, 1938‚Äì50 The SS Mongolia was renamed the Rimutaka by at least 15/10/1922, this from the ships cook ID. In 1938, the P&O; transferred the ship under long-term charter to their subsidiary, the New Zealand Shipping Company, who renamed her SS Rimutaka, the third ship of that name, registered at Plymouth. She was reconfigured at this time to carry 840 tourist class passengers; before entering service, she was in collision with off the Nore. After repairs, she departed for New Zealand for the first time on 12 December 1938. The Rimutaka worked a route from London, through Panama, to Auckland, New Zealand and terminating at Wellington, New Zealand. She suffered a fire in her No. 3 hold on 9 March 1939. In September of that year, she was requisitioned for conversion to an armed merchant cruiser due to the outbreak of World War II, but was released from that service before any conversion occurred. Instead, the Rimutaka was requisitioned for the Liner Division between 12 May 1940 and 14 June 1946, but remained in UK‚ÄîNew Zealand service for most of the war. After hostilities ceased, she continued in NZSC service on the same route; her last voyage with the company was in 1950, departing Wellington for London in January, 1950. She was returned to parent P&O; for sale. Europa, 1950‚Äì51 On 3 March 1950 the ship was transferred from P&O; to the Home Lines-affiliated Compania de Navegacion Incres SA (Incres Shipping Company) of Panama for ¬£95,000. She was renamed SS Europa, converted to take 614 tourist class passengers, was stripped of her refrigerated cargo space, and placed into service transporting stateless immigrants from Europe to the United States and Canada. She was Italian-crewed, and first sailed from Genoa; later crossings began from Antwerp and later Le Havre. A stop en route was made at Plymouth to collect British immigrants. The destinations were Halifax, Nova Scotia and New York City. The Europa continued in this service until the end of September, 1951. Nassau, 1951‚Äì61 After this, the ship was renovated in Genoa to become the Incres Nassau Line's SS Nassau, a cruise ship sailing from New York City to Nassau in the Bahamas. Her cargo holds were removed and swimming pools and other amenities were fitted, suiting her to her new role. This was the first time a ship was employed year-round as a cruise ship. In 1954 her registry was transferred to Liberia. Acapulco, 1961‚Äì63 The ship was purchased in 1961 by Natumex Line (), a Mexican government-owned company, to provide a fortnightly service between Acapulco and Los Angeles. She underwent a rebuild by the Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering Co., Ltd. of Glasgow, Scotland including the fitting of a new bow and funnel. The SS Acapulco then sailed for the United States, where she initially failed inspections by the United States Coast Guard. On her third trip from California she suffered a mechanical breakdown at sea. In 1962 she went to the Century 21 Exposition to serve as a hotel ship. In 1963 she was laid up at Manzanillo, Colima, and in 1964 she was towed to Japan for scrap, arriving at Osaka on 15 December 1964 for breaking up at Sakai. Demolition began on 6 January 1965.

History Thorp is a common place-name of Old Norse origin meaning hamlet or small village. In the Domesday Book of 1086 Thorp was a possession of Count Alan of Brittany. Perrow derives from the lords of the manor of Pirnhow (also written Pirhou or Pirho) in Norfolk, who were the earliest known tenants here. In 1286-87 Helewise de Perrow was a tenant. There is no surviving record of a village at Thorp Perrow. A park called Thorpe Park went with the manor of Thorp Perrow in the 16th and 17th centuries. Spring Wood was planted in the 16th century, and survives to this day. Thorp Perrow Hall was built in the early 18th century. Ornamental gardens and lakes were laid out around 1800, and a collection of exotic conifers called Milbank Pinetum was planted between 1840 and 1870 by Lady Augusta Milbank. The Arboretum was originally created by Colonel Sir Leonard Ropner (1895‚Äì1977) in 1931. Leonard Ropner also founded several gardens in the park. Today the Thorp Perrow estate is considered to be one of the finest arboreta in the United Kingdom; The Times listed it as one of the top ten. In July 2006 the gardens celebrated their 75th anniversary by planting the 1,750th tree. The arboretum today Thorp Perrow is now open to the public. It holds five National Plant Collections: Tilia (Lime), Fraxinus (Ash), Cotinus (Smoke Bush), Laburnum and Juglans (Walnut), and has 48 Champion trees in its collection.

He returned to Liverpool in 1988 as a coach, having worked with the Mersyside Youth Association from 1982. He was responsible for the club's centre of excellence programme and was involved in the youth team that won the FA Youth Cup for the first time in 1996. He then worked in the club's new youth academy and managed the reserve team before leaving Liverpool in 2009. Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard were among those who came through the academy during McAuley's time at Liverpool. McAuley's son, Hugh, made 100 appearances in the Football League for Cheltenham Town.

Name The species name umbratica means \\"living in the shadows\\" in Latin. Description upright ‚ôÇ The walnut orb-weaver spider is very wide and flattened, with a leathery skin. Its color ranges from red brown and grey brown to black with a dark, yellowish to yellow-greenish leaf-like fleckled marking on its opisthosoma, where small dents are visible. These are the onsets of muscles that flatten the abdomen. Female N. umbratica can reach up to 15 mm in size, the males grow only up to 8 mm. The spider hides during the day outside of buildings in wall crevices, or under loose bark. They are very common in Central Europe; females occur all year long, while males appear mostly during summer. This spider has a flattened body, helping it to secrete itself in cracks and crevices. Walnut orb-weaving spiders are capable of concealing themselves in very confined spaces. This tends to act as a defensive advantage and increases the number of locations an orb-web can be effectively constructed. In the evening the spider constructs an orb-web that can be up to 70 cm in diameter. A signaling thread leads from the web to her hiding place. After dusk she sits in the web's center. As with all orbweavers any bite is of no consequence.

There are hundreds of different styles of Chinese martial arts, each with their own sets of techniques and ideas. The concept of martial arts styles appeared from around the Ming dynasty (13681644). Before the Ming period, martial skills were commonly differentiated mainly by their lineage. There are common themes among these styles which allow them to be grouped according to generalized \\"families\\" (), \\"fractions\\" (), \\"class\\" (), or \\"schools\\" () of martial art styles. There are styles that mimic movements from animals, or otherwise refer or allude to animals or mythical beings such as dragons, and others that gather inspiration from various Chinese philosophies or mythologies. Some deeply internal styles tend to focus strongly on practice relating to harnessing of qi energy, while some more-conspicuously external styles tend more to display skills and abilities in competition or exhibition. The rich variety of styles has led to the creation of numerous classification schemes.Brian Kennedy and Elizabeth Guo (2005), Chinese Martial Arts Training Manuals: A Historical Survey, CA: North Atlantic Books, Geographical location such as regional affiliation is one well-known example. A particular Chinese martial arts style can be referred to as either a northern fist () or a southern fist () depending on its point of origin. Additional details such as province or city can further identify the particular style. Other classification schemes include the concept of external () and internal (). This criterion concerns the training focus of a particular style. Religious affiliation of the group that found the style can also be used as a classification. The three great religions of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism have associated martial arts styles. There are also many other criteria used to group Chinese martial arts; for example, imitative-styles () and legendary styles; historical styles and family styles. Another more recent approach is to describe a style according to their combat focus. Geographical classifications The traditional dividing line between the northern and southern Chinese martial arts is the Yangtze River.Donn F. Draeger, Robert W. Smith (1981), Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts, Oxford University Press (USA), A well-known adage concerning Chinese martial arts is the term \\"Southern fists and Northern kicks\\" („ÄåÂçóÊã≥ÂåóËÖø„Äç). This saying emphasizes the difference between the two groups of Chinese martial arts. However, such differences are not absolute and there are many Northern styles that excel in hand techniques and conversely, there are many different types of kicks in some Southern styles. A style can also be more clearly classified according to regional landmarks, province, city and even to a specific village. =Northern styles= Manchu banner soldier, a caste of professional martial artists active in Chinese society as recently as a hundred years ago Northern styles/Bƒõi p√†i (ÂåóÊ¥æ) feature deeply extended postures‚Äîsuch as the horse, bow, drop, and dragon stances‚Äîconnected by quick fluid transitions, able to quickly change the direction in which force is issued.Jwing Ming Yang and Jeffery A. Bolt (1981), Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu, Unique Publications, Brian Klingborg (1999), The Secrets of Northern Shaolin Kung-Fu, Tuttle Pub, Jeffery A. Bolt and Jwing-Ming Yang (2000), Northern Shaolin Sword: Form, Techniques & Applications, YMAA Publication Center, The group of Northern martial arts includes many illustrious styles such as Baguazhang, Bajiquan, ChƒÅqu√°n, Chuojiao, Eagle Claw, Northern Praying Mantis and Taijiquan. Ch√°ngqu√°n is often identified as the representative Northern style and forms a separate division in modern Wushu curriculum. Northern styles exhibit a distinctively different flavor from the martial arts practiced in the South. In general, the training characteristics of northern styles put more focus on legwork, kicking and acrobatics. The influence of Northern styles can be found in traditional Korean martial arts and their emphasis on high-level kicks.Stanly E. Henning (2000), \\"Chinese Influences on Korean Martial Arts\\" in Martial arts of the world: an encyclopedia, edited by Thomas A. Green, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2001, page 299, It has been suggested that the presence of high kicks and flying kicks found in Southern styles, in Okinawan martial arts, and hence in modern non-Chinese styles such as karate and taekwondo (and by extension modern kickboxing) are due to influence from northern styles during the first half of the 20th century.William Durbin Mastering Kempo, 2001 p. 11. =Southern styles= Southern Chinese martial arts/Nanquan (ÂçóÊ¥æ) feature low stable stances and short powerful movements that combine both attack and defense. In practice, Nanquan focus more on the use of the arm and full body techniques than high kicks or acrobatic moves. There are various explanations for those characteristics.Jane Hallander (1985), The Complete Guide to Kung Fu Fighting Styles, Unique Publications, CA, USA, The influence of Southern styles can be found in Goju Ryu, a karate style from Okinawa.Patrick McCarthy (1999), Ancient Okinawan Martial Arts, Tuttle Publishing, The term Southern styles typically applies to the five family styles of Southern China: Choy Gar (Ëî°ÂÆ∂), Hung Ga (Ê¥™ÂÆ∂), Lau Gar (ÂàòÂÆ∂), Ng Ying Kungfu (), Li (Lee) Family (ÊùéÂÆ∂) and Mok Gar (Ëé´ÂÆ∂).Bucksam Kong and Eugene H. Ho (1973),Hung Gar Kung Fu, Black Belt Communications, Other styles include: Choy Li Fut, Fujian White Crane, Dog Style Kungfu, Five Ancestors, Wing Chun, Southern Praying Mantis, Hak Fu Mun, Bak Mei and Dragon. There are sub-divisions to Southern styles due to their similar characteristics and common heritage. For example, the Fujian martial arts can be considered to be one such sub-division. This groups share the following characteristics that \\"during fights, pugilists of these systems prefer short steps and close fighting, with their arms placed close to the chest, their elbows lowered and kept close to the flanks to offer them protection\\".Leung Ting (1978). Wing Tsun Kuen. Hong Kong: Leung's Publications. , 1978, p. 30 Nanquan (Southern Fist) became a separate and distinct component of the current Wushu training. It was designed to incorporate the key elements of each major Southern style. =Other geographical classifications= Chinese martial arts can also be identified by the regional landmarks, province, city or even village. Generally, this identification indicates the region of origin but could also describe the place where the style has established a reputation. Well-known landmarks used to characterize Chinese martial arts include the famous mountains of China. The Eight Great Schools of Martial Arts (ÂÖ´Â§ßÈñÄÊ¥æ/ÂÖ´Â§ßÈó®Ê¥æ), a grouping of martial arts schools used in many wuxia novels, is based on this type of geographical classifications. This group of schools includes: Hua Shan (ËèØÂ±±/ÂçéÂ±±), Emei Mountains (Â≥®ÂµãÂ±±), Wudang Shan (Ê≠¶ÂΩìÂ±±), Mt. Kongtong (Â¥ÜÂ≥íÂ±±), Kunlun Mountains (Â¥ëÂ¥ôÂ±±/ÊòÜ‰ªëÂ±±), Cang Mountain (ËíºÂ±±/ËãçÂ±±), Mount Qingcheng (ÈùíÂüéÂ±±) and Mount Song Shaolin (Âµ©Â±±Â∞ëÊûó). Historically, there are 18 provinces (ÁúÅ) in China. Each province has its own styles of martial arts. For example, in Xingyi, there are currently three main branches: Shanxi, Hebei and Henan. Each branch has unique characteristics but they can all be traced to the original art developed by Li Luoneng and the Dai family. A particular style can also be identified by the city where the art was practised. For example, in the North, the cities of Beijing or Tianjin have created different martial arts branches for many styles. Similarly, in the South, the cities of Shanghai, Quandong and Foshan all represented centers of martial arts development. Older martial art styles can be described by their village affiliation. For example, Zhaobao t'ai chi ch'uan (Ë∂ôÂ†°ÂøΩÈùàÊû∂Â§™Ê•µÊã≥/ËµµÂ†°ÂøΩÁÅµÊû∂Â§™ÊûÅÊã≥) is a branch of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan originating from Zhaobao village. External and internal classifications The distinction between external and internal (Â§ñÂÜÖ) martial arts comes from Huang Zongxi's 1669 Epitaph for Wang Zhengnan. Stanley Henning proposes that the Epitaph's identification of the internal martial arts with the Taoism indigenous to China and its identification of the external martial arts with the foreign Buddhism of Shaolin‚Äîand the Manchu Qing Dynasty to which Huang Zongxi was opposed‚Äîmay have been an act of political defiance rather than one of technical classification. Kennedy and Guo suggests that external and internal classifications only became popular during the Republican period. It was used to differentiate between two competing groups within The Central Guoshu Academy. Regardless of the origin of this classification scheme, the distinction becomes less meaningful since all complete Chinese martial art styles have external and internal components. This classification scheme is only a reminder of the initial emphasis of a particular style and should not be considered an absolute division. =External styles= External style () are often associated with Chinese martial arts. They are characterized by fast and explosive movements and a focus on physical strength and agility. External styles includes both the traditional styles focusing on application and fighting, as well as the modern styles adapted for competition and exercise. Examples of external styles are Shaolinquan, with its direct explosive attacks and many Wushu forms that have spectacular aerial techniques. External styles begin with a training focus on muscular power, speed and application, and generally integrate their qigong aspects in advanced training, after their desired \\"hard\\" physical level has been reached. Most Chinese martial art styles are classified as external styles. =Internal styles= Taijiquan, the best-known internal style of Chinese martial arts, being practiced at the Fragrant Hills Park, Beijing Internal styles () focus on the practice of such elements as awareness of the spirit, mind, qi (breath, or energy flow) and the use of relaxed leverage rather than muscular tension, which soft stylists call \\"brute force\\".B. K. Frantzis (1998), The Power of Internal Martial Arts: Combat Secrets of Ba Gua, Tai Chi, and Hsing-I, North Atlantic Books, CA, While the principles that distinguish internal styles from the external were described at least as early as the 18th century by Chang Nai-chou,Marnix Wells, Chang Naizhou, Xu Zhen (2005), Scholar Boxer: Ch√°ng N√¢izhou's Theory of Internal Martial Arts and the Evolution of Taijiquan, North Atlantic Books (CA), the modern terms distinguishing external and internal styles were first recorded by Sun Lutang; who wrote that Taijiquan, Baguazhang, and Xingyiquan were internal arts.Sun Lu Tang (192?), Master Sun Lu Tang's Martial Arts Concepts, in Chinese republished in 2004, Hong Kong, Later on, others began to include their style under this definition; for example, Liuhebafa, Zi Ran Men, and Yiquan. Components of internal training includes stance training (zhan zhuang), stretching and strengthening of muscles, as well as on empty hand and weapon forms which can contain quite demanding coordination from posture to posture.Lu Shengli, Zhang Yun (2006), Combat Techniques of Taiji, Xingyi, and Bagua: Principles and Practices of Internal Martial Arts, Blue Snake Books/Frog, Ltd., Many internal styles have basic two-person training, such as pushing hands. A prominent characteristic of internal styles is that the forms are generally performed at a slow pace. This is thought to improve coordination and balance by increasing the work load, and to require the student to pay minute attention to their whole body and its weight as they perform a technique. In some styles, for example in Chen style of taijiquan, there are forms that include sudden outbursts of explosive movements. At an advanced level, and in actual fighting, internal styles are performed quickly, but the goal is to learn to involve the entire body in every motion, to stay relaxed, with deep, controlled breathing, and to coordinate the motions of the body and the breathing accurately according to the dictates of the forms while maintaining perfect balance. Internal styles have been associated in legend and in much popular fiction with the Taoist monasteries of Wudangshan in central China. Religious classifications Chinese martial arts being an important component of Chinese culture are also influence by the various religions in China. Many styles were founded by groups that were influenced by one of the three great philosophical influences of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. =Buddhist styles= Buddhist (‰ΩõÊïô, F√≥ji√†o) styles include Chinese martial arts that originated or practised within Buddhist temples and later spread to lay community. These styles often include Buddhist philosophy, imagery and principles. The most famous of these are the Shaolin (and related) styles, e.g. Shaolinquan, Choy Li Fut, Luohanquan, Hung Gar, Wing Chun, Dragon style and White Crane. and recently a contemporary style called wuxingheqidao. One common theme for this group is the association with the philosophy of Ch√°n (Zen) Buddhism and its founder, Bodhidharma. Shaolin Kung Fu The term \\"Shaolin\\" (Â∞ëÊûó, Sh√†ol√≠n) is used to refer to those styles that trace their origins to Shaolin, be it the Shaolin Monastery in Henan Province, another temple associated with Shaolin such as the Southern Shaolin Temple in Fujian Province, or even wandering Shaolin monks. More restrictive definitions include only those styles that were conceived on temple grounds or even just the original Henan temple proper. The broadest definition includes just about all external Chinese martial arts, though this has much to do with the attractiveness of the Shaolin \\"brand name\\". =Taoist styles= Taoist (ÈÅìÊïô; D√†oji√†o) styles are popularly associated with Taoism. They include Chinese martial arts that were created or trained mostly within Taoist Temples or by Taoist ascetics, which often later spread out to laymen. These styles include those trained in the Wudang temple, and often include Taoist principles, philosophy, and imagery. Some of these arts include Taijiquan, Wudangquan, Baguazhang and Liuhebafa. =Islamic styles= Islamic (ÂõûÊïô; Hu√≠ji√†o) styles are those that were practiced traditionally solely or mainly by the Muslim Hui minority in China. These styles often include Islamic principles or imagery. Example of these styles include: ChƒÅqu√°n, Tan Tui, some branches of Xingyiquan, Bajiquan, and Qƒ´sh√¨qu√°n (‰∏ÉÂ£´Êã≥). Historical classifications =Imitative-styles= Imitative-styles are styles that were developed based on the characteristics of a particular creature such as a bird or an insect. Entire systems of fighting were developed based on the observations of their movement, fighting abilities and spirit. Examples of the most well-known styles are white crane, tiger, monkey (Houquan), dog and mantis. In some systems, a variety of animals are used to represent the style of the system; for instance, there are twelve animals in most Xing yi practice. =Legendary and historical styles= Many Chinese martial arts styles are based or named after legends or historical figures. Examples of such styles based on legends and myths are the Eight Immortals and Dragon styles. Example of styles attributed to historical figures include Xing yi and its relationship to Yue Fei and T'ai chi which trace its origins to a Taoist Zhang Sanfeng. =Family styles= Family affiliations are also an important means of identifying a Chinese martial arts system. Heavily influenced by the Confucian tradition, many styles are named in honor of the founder of the system. The five family (Choi, Hung, Lau, Lei, Mok) of Southern Chinese martial arts are representative of family styles. Family styles can also denote branches of a system. For example, the families of Chen, Yang, Wu and Sun represent different training approaches to the art of Tai Chi Chuan. =By main style of application/attack= Another popular method to describe a particular style of Chinese martial arts is to describe the style's emphasis in terms of the four major applications. The four major applications are: kicking (Ë∏¢), hitting (Êâì), wrestling (Êëî) and grabbing (Chin na, Êãø). A complete system will necessary include all four types of applications but each style will differ in their training focus. For example, most Northern styles are said to emphasize kicking, Southern styles have a reputation for their intricate hand techniques, Shuai jiao practitioners train predominately in full-body close- range techniques, Eagle claw fighters are noted for their grabbing expertise, and Wing Chun focusses on hitting (with the hands/elbows). =Other styles= The variety of classification schemes, like the subject of Chinese martial arts, are endless. Some styles are named after well-known Chinese philosophies. For example, Baguazhang is based on the Taoist philosophy of the eight trigrams (Bagua). Some styles are named after the key insight suggested by the training. For example, Liuhebafa is a system based on the ideas of six combinations and eight methods.

A short-lived boat, U-964 is most noted for being one of three new boats ordered by the Kriegsmarine to attack Convoy ON 206 in the Western Approaches. To do this, the three boats had to travel a long distance on the surface during daylight hours in a region patrolled by Allied aircraft. This had fatal consequences for all U-boats involved. U-964 was built by the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg during 1942 as a Type VIIC boat designed to fight in the waters of the Northern Atlantic Ocean. Her construction was rapid and smooth, and following her completion in February 1943 she was taken for training and working-up patrols in the Baltic Sea and off the Norwegian coast. Her commander during this period was veteran submariner Kapit√§nleutnant Emmo Hummerjohann, who was experienced in combat operations and was still in charge when she departed Bergen, Norway in early October 1943 for her maiden combat patrol in the North Atlantic. Design German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-964 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri & Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-964 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and one twin C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. Service history =War patrol= Following her departure from Norway, she passed into the Atlantic and headed southwards towards the Western Approaches. After eleven days sailing, she was still well within range of Allied aircraft when she received a radio message to link with and and attack an important convoy several hundred miles to the south. Realising that the only feasible method of reaching the area on time was to travel on the surface, the three boats proceeded south in full daylight on 16 October 1943. =Fate= Luck ran out fast as a patrolling aircraft spotted the boats and called in Consolidated Liberator aircraft from several different squadrons. A fierce battle followed, in which two Royal Air Force Liberators were shot down before all three boats were sunk. U-964 was seriously damaged by bombs from aircraft of 86 Squadron (particularly from the plane of Flying Officer George Gamble), and began to sink, her crew scrambling over the side into the sea as she settled. Of the approximately 35 men who escaped the submarine, only five survived to be collected by several days later. Only three of these men subsequently recovered from their ordeal.

At 9:05 AM local time 2006 Hezbollah's military wing launched a barrage of rockets and mortars on the northern Israeli town of Shlomi, apparently as a diversion. An Israeli border patrol consisting of two armored IDF Humvees patrolling on the Israeli side of the border near the village of Zar'it was attacked with anti-tank rockets killing three soldiers, wounding three, and abducting two into Lebanon's territory. Hezbollah has named this operation \\"True Promise.\\". The IDF confirmed that two Israeli soldiers were abducted from Israeli territory by Hezbollah, and identified them as Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. An Israeli Merkava Mark II tank was damaged by a 300 kg improvised explosive device as it crossed the border in Lebanon, attempting to pursue Hezbollah. All four of the crew members were killed. Another Israeli soldier was killed when he came under heavy fire during an attempted recovery of the bodies from the tank. In all, 8 soldiers were killed, 2 captured and 6 wounded. Israel's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mark Regev claims the Hezbollah unit that captured the two soldiers is trying to transfer them to Iran. However, the spokesman did not disclose his source. Israel attacked Hezbollah's TV station Al-Manar and radio station Al-Nour in Haret Hreyk (Harat Hurayk), a southern suburb of Beirut, and in Baalbeck. Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah later declared that \\"No military operation will return them [the captured soldiers]... The prisoners will not be returned except through one way: indirect negotiations and a trade [of prisoners].\\"Hizbullah leader calls for prisoner exchange ‚Äì Al Bawaba ‚Äì July 12, 2006 The attacks came two weeks after the beginning of the Gaza Strip-focused Operation Summer Rains by the Israel Defense Forces whose objective was to free the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit captured on June 25, 2006 by Hamas militants in an earlier cross-border attack organized by Hamas that left two Israeli soldiers dead. In negotiations for the 2004 prisoner exchange, Hezbollah had sought the release of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel. While many were released, Hezbollah failed to achieve the release of Samir Kuntar. Having failed to achieve this objective, Hassan Nasrallah declared that the organization would carry out further operations at a later date to gain the release of the remaining prisoners. The Hezbollah leader later called for talks on prisoner exchange which was officially rejected by Olmert. However it is widely believed that negotiations are underway with Egypt as mediator. Israel called together an emergency cabinet meeting, and said that it held the Beirut government responsible for the attack, vowing that it would pay a \\"heavy price\\" for the attacks, adding \\"The Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a part, is trying to shake regional stability\\". Plans to locate \\"thousands\\" of reserve troops were also announced. Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz also said that \\"the State of Israel sees itself free to use all measures that it finds it needs, and the [Israeli Forces] have been given orders in that direction.\\" The United Nations envoy to the region, Geir Pedrson, condemned the Hezbollah action and called on Hezbollah to release the soldiers. Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora denied any knowledge of the raid and stated that he did not condone it. An emergency meeting of the Lebanese government reaffirmed this position. Hezbollah's action aroused varying reactions among Lebanese political forces. It was harshly criticised by many members of the largely anti-Syrian parliamentary majority, while Michel Aoun, despite his understanding with the party, declared that he supported the government's position. In response, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) launched a series of air and artillery strikes at positions in southern Lebanon, generally seen as the support base for Hezbollah. Israeli General Dan Halutz threatened to \\"turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years\\" in a reference to the destruction Lebanon suffered in its bloody civil war. Israeli troops later bombed a main road in the south of Lebanon leaving two civilians dead, and a series of air-raids followed during the night which also targeted the civilian infrastructure. Israel said that they were trying to prevent the captured soldiers from being removed to Iran. =Thursday, July 13= On Thursday, July 13, Israel began implementing a land and sea blockade on Lebanon. The Beirut International Airport (the sole international airport in Lebanon) was bombed, forcing all international flights to be diverted to Cyprus. The Israeli army said the airport had been used to smuggle in weapons to Hezbollah. Many roads and bridges were struck by Israel, essentially cutting off the predominantly Shia southern Lebanon from the Capital in Beirut, the south of Lebanon is considered Hezbollah's heartland. Warplanes also bombed the road to Damascus, the capital of Syria, and have struck a bridge in a suburb south of Beirut, a place highly valued by Hezbollah. They also struck a power plant's fuel storage south of Beirut (but did not destroy the plant itself). People living in this region heard at least three strikes. No casualties have been reported yet. However, the strike eventually resulted in the spilling of over 15,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, affecting of coastline and threatening aquatic life and fishing. Israeli jets attacked two Lebanese military air bases, destroying runways which Israel claims were used by the Hezbollah to transfer supplies. Attacks against the Rayak air base in the eastern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border and the Qulayaat military airport (also known as Kleyate or Rene Mouawad airport) in northern Lebanon were the first attacks against Lebanon's army in the conflict. An unnamed senior IDF officer stated that the strikes were targeted against rocket launch sites and rocket storerooms, although, he said, many of them were intentionally located by Hezbollah in civilian population centers. An unnamed Lebanese official responded that \\"Hezbollah did not store arms in civilian areas.\\" Air strikes were also carried out against outposts of Hezbollah. Israel had named the overall operation \\"Just Reward\\", and Maj.-Gen. Udi Adam of the Northern Command, says Israel has not ruled out sending ground forces into Lebanon. Hezbollah declared an all-out military alert, and said it had 13,000 rockets capable of hitting towns and installations far into northern Israel. As a result, Defense Minister Peretz told commanders to prepare civil defense plans, and some 220,000 Israeli civilians spent the night in bomb shelters. Hezbollah continued to fire rockets at Israel, killing one Israeli civilian, a 40-year-old in Nahariya, and wounding 14 others. Another Israeli civilian, a 33-year-old man in Safed, later died from the wounds inflicted. Hezbollah had threatened to hit the city Haifa, \\"if the southern suburbs and the city of Beirut are subjected to any direct Israeli aggression\\". Two rockets hit Haifa, hours after the threat. Hezbollah denied firing any rockets at the city. Israeli sources later reported that two rockets were fired from inside Lebanon. The attack is the first time rockets have hit so far south into Israel. One shock injury had been reported from these initial attacks on Haifa. Twelve members of one Lebanese family were reported by Lebanese authorities to have been killed when Israeli planes bombed their home in the Lebanese village of Zibqine, near Tyre. According to the Lebanese government, in Dweir, a small village near Nabatiye, Israeli planes dropped a bomb onto the home of a local Shia Muslim cleric, killing him, his wife and eight of his children. Another family from that same village was also reported to have lost seven members following Israeli bombing. (requires registration) Israel intensified its response on Lebanon by attacking the Beirut International Airport and damaging three runways. The Lebanese government called for a Cease-fire, claiming the Israeli response was \\"disproportionate\\", a view echoed by France and Russia. 35 Lebanese civilians are believed to have been killed.Israel imposes Lebanon blockade ‚Äì BBC News ‚Äì Thursday, July 13, 2006 =Friday, July 14= Map of conflict as of July 14, 2006.

Hezbollah declares \\"open war\\". The Israeli Sa'ar 5-class missile boat INS Hanit that was blockading the waters off of the Lebanese coast was damaged in the stern after being hit by a C-802 anti-ship missile. Various sources are reporting that the missile is Chinese- made while others report that it was Iranian-made or procured from Iran, a charge which Iran denies.

Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz has declared martial law throughout north Israel. On July 15, Israel attacked commercial ports in the towns of Beirut and Tripoli, as well as ports in Jounieh and Amsheet, two predominantly Christian towns. A witness reported that at least 15 Lebanese villagers were killed on July 15 in an Israeli air strike on vehicles fleeing a village in southern Lebanon. The convoy left the border village of Marwahin, was refused asylum in a U.N. base and afterwards it was attacked. It is also reported that some hours before the strike, Israeli forces had told the inhabitants of the village to evacuate by loudspeaker. =Sunday, July 16= On the morning of July 16, several barrages of Katyusha rockets hit the northern cities of Haifa, Acre, and Nahariya, and explosions were also heard in Rosh HaNikra. Eight were killed in Haifa, and several were seriously wounded when unguided rockets hit a railway maintenance depot.

Rockets also hit the villages of Shtula and Zar'it, the site of the original Hezbollah attack. Additional barrages hit the Israeli Arab town of Ghajar and kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch as well as striking Meron and Safed again, all with no injuries. On Sunday evening Hezbollah militants attempted to infiltrate an Israel Defense Forces post on the Lebanese Border. Vladimir Putin said that \\"Israel may be pursuing other aims in Lebanon than saving two soldiers taken hostage\\" on July 16. On July 16, Lebanese President √âmile Lahoud and Lebanese military sources stated that Israeli forces had used white phosphorus incendiary bombs against civilian targets on villages in the Arqoub area in the South accusing Israel of using banned weapons against Lebanese civilians. This claim has not been verified. (However, according to several sources, mainly UN, Israel artillery sprayed the entire Southern Lebanon with cluster bombs, mostly outdated surplus from previous wars, some as old as 1982. As much as 2/3 of the explosives was reported unexploded, and according to UN mine clearing units as of March 2008 still on average killing or wounding one Lebanese every second day. UN has to date disarmed 160.000 hidden bomb units but believes to have another million to go.) On July 16, Sky News reported that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was wounded in a morning air strike on his Beirut compound, though Hezbollah affiliated sources have denied the reports as propaganda. News services report that three explosions have been heard in Beirut. Hezbollah TV reports that the air strike destroyed a building containing the headquarters of Hezbollah, with Hezbollah's chief, Hassan Nasrallah, likely inside. He was not harmed, however, and has since released a videotape. =Monday, July 17= The Hezbollah leader, Nasrallah, said in his third televised speech since the conflict began that \\"In the beginning, we started to act calmly, we focused on Israel military bases and we didn't attack any settlement, Hizbullah militants had destroyed military bases, while the Israelis killed civilians and targeted Lebanon's infrastructure.\\" He added that Hezbollah's arsenal had yet to take a direct hit \\"and so far we have used a small portion of our weaponry.\\"Hizbullah leader promises enemy 'more surprises' ‚Äì Daily Star (Lebanon) ‚Äì Monday, July 17, 2006.

Damage to fuel containers in Jiyye and 12 service stations in Bir Abed, Khiam, Ain Ibl, Moseileh, Rmeileh, Houla, Hesbe, Tyre, Kfar Kila, and Douris raised the likelihood of fuel shortages. July 20‚Äì31 =Thursday, July 20= On July 20, there was further fighting inside the Lebanese border between IDF soldiers and Hezbollah militants. According to Captain Eric Scheider from the IDF, there had been heavy fighting in two places inside the Lebanese border.

CNN reported that the Israeli Army had explained the bombing was to \\"protect ground forces operating in the border area and were not aimed at specific targets\\". The bombing led to damage of an unspecified number of Lebanese Army vehicles in the area. The Israeli Army apologised for the damage. On July 31, 2006, Hezbullah said that its forces hit an Israeli corvette near the city of Tyre; Israel denied that any of its ships was hit. One Lebanese Army personnel was killed, and three were injured in an IDF Naval attack on the Lebanese military base north of Tyre. The towns of Al-Awayda area, Kafr Shuba' and Kafr Hamam were also hit with IDF artillery strikes. The Tyre‚ÄìKila area was also the scene of IDF air strikes, a ground incursion, and clash with Hezbollah which left three IDF tank personnel wounded. There were unconfirmed reports of a late-night incursion by IDF on the western range of the Lebanese mountains and four Israeli IAF raids targeted the Faraya road around Hermel in the Bekaa valley. August 1‚Äì4 =Tuesday, August 1= Hezbollah said its fighters managed to destroy an Israeli warship of the coast of Tyre, though Israel disputed the claim. Shelling of Mansouri, Shamaa and Teir Harfan took place by IDF Naval units. Operations continued around Hermel with an attack on a pickup truck loaded with cooking gas tanks, and 5 strikes on a road linking eastern Lebanon to western regions and coastline. Attacks were also reported around the Masnaa crossing into Syria, which had been subject to a series of attacks in the last three days. Two of the four border crossings into Syria are now closed because of damage- the main Beirut-Damascus highway was described by the Jerusalem Post as \\"impassable\\" due to previous attacks. Defense Minister Peretz said that attacks would continue on targets which he reportedly described as \\"convoys smuggling weapons across the border into Lebanon\\". Shelling of the Ba'labak area near the Syrian border and several areas in Al Biqa' region were also reportedly hit with shelling and three air strikes. Six airstrikes reportedly hit the village of Sour. Al-Jazeera TV reported that Israeli aircraft bombed Bayyada, and Mansoureh. The IDF reported that twenty Hezbollah fighters in the villages of Al Taiba and Al Adasiyya were killed during fighting in the areas since July 30. :see: Battle of Ayta al-Sha\`b A clash between IDF Paratroopers & Hezbollah was reported to have taken place around Ayta a-Shaab with three IDF dead by anti-tank fire with the IDF saying twenty Hezbollah died in the fighting. The IDF later confirmed the Hezbollah dead as ten. Hezbollah issued a statement saying that the IDF had killed three Hezbollah fighters during fighting around Kfar Kila, Adaisse, and Taibeh, near the Lebanese town of Marjayoun. Hezbollah gave its fatalities since July 13 as forty-eight in total. While the IDF reported four Hezbollah dead. Five rockets and a number of mortar shells were fired at the western Galilee between Rosh HaNikra and on Tuesday wounding five IDF. =Wednesday, August 2= Between evening of August 1 and early on August 2 IDF Commandos were reported to be engaged in fighting around Dar al-Hikma Hospital in Baalbek, an area described as a \\"Hezbollah stronghold\\". The intended target of the raid was reported to have been Sheikh Mohammed Yazbek a member of Hezbollah's Shoura Council, and a Lebanese representative of the Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Last month the IAF bombed his house in Baalbek. It was unclear whether Yazbek had been captured by IDF but it was reported that he was not in the hospital at the time of the raid. The IDF denied Yazbek was the intended target of the raid on the hospital but three unidentified POW described as \\"Hizbullah officials\\" were captured. In a broadcast on Al-Manar TV Hezbollah said \\"Those who were taken prisoner are citizens. It will not be long before the enemy will discover that they are ordinary citizens.\\" 11 civilians were reported killed, 10 Lebanese and one Syrian. Hezbollah said it had attacked an Israeli Army armoured unit inside Lebanon, destroying two tanks and leaving their crews dead or wounded as they attempted to advance on the Rub Thalatheen hill at Adaisseh. The IDF denied the report. =Thursday, August 3= An IDF missile struck a house in Taibeh in the early morning, killing a family of three, Lebanese security officials said. Taibeh was the scene of fighting between IDF & Hezbollah. Hezbollah said it destroyed one IDF tank and two bulldozers killing or woundings it occupants. IDF said one tank was damaged with no casualties. 132 rockets hit Israel by 1300 hrs localtime. 100 hitting northern Israel in a matter of minutes. Israeli death toll in the conflict stood at 68, with 41 soldiers killed in fighting and 27 civilians in rocket attacks. Lebanese PM Saniora said more than 900 people had been killed and 3,000 wounded, but he did not say whether the new figure, a rise of 380 from 520 confirmed dead also included those missing presumed dead. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed to strike Tel Aviv in retaliation for Israel's bombardment of Lebanon's capital, Beirut. \\"If you hit Beirut, the Islamic resistance will hit Tel Aviv and is able to do that with God's help\\", Nasrallah said in a televised address. Hezbollah spokesman Hussein Rahal told al Jazeera television: \\"Declaring a cease-fire is not the concern of the people of Lebanon as long as there is one Israeli soldier on Lebanese soil ‚Äì even one meter (into Lebanon).. We will not accept any (Israeli) soldier staying on Lebanese territory, and it is the right of every Lebanese to fight until liberation.\\" Israeli Defense Minister Peretz announced that he had instructed the IDF to prepare for \\"a swift takeover of the entire area south of the Litani [River]\\" and to operate in all the areas where rockets had been launched. An incursion to the Litani would represent a distance of 18 miles (29 km) into south Lebanon. IDF said its soldiers have taken up positions in or near 11 towns and villages in south Lebanon, a zone reaching from the coast to the 'Galilee Panhandle' eastwards. Estimates of IDF forces in S.Lebanon were six brigades approximately 10,000 soldiers. IDF bombers, reportedly fired two rockets at a house in Baalbek. One woman died and three people were wounded, IDF officials stated. Calls for a ceasefire demanded that Israel stops its revenge attacks against Lebanese civilians and that Hezbollah lay down its arms.http://www.democracyinlebanon.org/Documents/CDL- Exclusives/DonQuixote(08-03-06).htm =Friday, August 4= It was estimated in a Haaretz analysis piece that the total number of rocket launchers that had been destroyed by IDF forces in Lebanon was \\"ten\\" and an estimate of Hezbollah killed given by IDF was \\"380\\". 33 civilian farm workers are killed and 20 wounded after Israeli airstrike in a farm near Qaa in Lebanon, close to the Lebanon-Syria border in the Beqaa valley A hospital official and the mayor said all the casualties were Syrian workers, and security forces said most of the casualties were employees or truck drivers. The IDF said it targeted two buildings that contained weapons. The Israeli government has accused Hezbollah of using civilians as shields. Israeli aircraft destroyed four bridges on the main coastal highway north of Beirut, disrupting efforts to aid civilians displaced or trapped by the conflict. After bombing the last land routes into Beirut, and effectively cutting off the Lebanese capital from relief supplies, Israel issued a statement saying the attacks were designed to thwart Syrian attempts to arm Hezbollah.\\" \\"Syria is determined to continue rearming Hezbollah and supply it with weaponry used to attack Israel\\", said an IDF statement. \\"The IDF is determined to stop this flow of arms to Hezbollah. The attacks on the bridge last night, which connect Syria and Lebanon, were to this end.\\" The IDF said the two or three rockets were among more than 200 that landed across northern Israel. The most deadly attack came in Tiberias, where three civilians were killed. The IDF put the Israeli death toll at 74, including 30 civilians. Israeli authorities say more than 600 people have been injured. Across Lebanon, dozens died in Israeli attacks, as Hezbollah rockets struck Hadera, the southernmost point the Islamic militia has reached with its attacks thus far in the conflict. No injuries were reported, police said. Hadera is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Tel Aviv, which Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah threatened August 3 to strike in retaliation for Israeli attacks on Beirut. On the Lebanese side of the border, AP quoted Lebanese security officials as saying that Israeli airstrikes buried 57 people under rubble after flattening homes in two villages near the Israeli border, Taibeh and Ayta ash Shab. No other details were immediately available. =Sunday, August 6= Twelve IDF reservists are killed by a Katyusha rocket explosion in Kfar Giladi, in the single deadliest strike on Israeli soldiers during the 2006 Lebanon War. =Thursday, August 10= By this time, nine IDF brigades of both regular and regular troops were operating in Southern Lebanon, about 12 kilometers (8 miles) into Lebanon.

Israeli commandos also destroyed a rocket launcher on a beach south of Tyre, and another rocket launcher was destroyed north of Bint Jbeil.IDF: We drew lessons Post-ceasefire events On August 14, 2006, hours after the beginning of the ceasefire, about four mortars were fired inside southern Lebanon. An Israeli military spokesman said that Israel would not respond to their firing. On that day four more incidents were recorded when armed Hezbollah members said to have approached Israeli positions were killed. * On August 15, 2006 Israeli soldiers opened fire when four Hezbollah fighters approached them, killing three.

Israel reiterated it wouldn't respond since the rockets did not cross border. * On August 18, 2006 Lebanese police sources reported that Israeli warplanes launched four missiles toward targets in the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek. Israeli sources acknowledge that its air force performs sorties over Lebanese territory, but denied breaking the ceasefire. Lebanese officials later contradicted the police sources stating that no missiles were fired by the Israeli planes. The Associated Press reported that Hezbollah had fired at least 10 Katyusha rockets into southern Lebanon. The IDF stated that as none had crossed the border and there were no casualties, they did not respond. Earlier, skirmishes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah left six guerrillas dead. UNIFIL also reported that the IDF fired a tank shell at the Lebanese village of Markaba but that there was no response from the other side.Four Hezbollah fighters killed in ceasefire breaches: UN ‚Äì Agence France-Presse (via Yahoo!).

The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said \\"as of now\\" it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it. Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz telephoned his German counterpart Franz Josef Jung to clarify that 'Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions' against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of UNIFIL to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah.

The Standing Buddha of the Tokyo National Museum is a remarkable example of Greco-Buddhist statuary. Comparable ones can be found in the Guimet Museum in France, and in the National Museum, New Delhi besides various other museums of South Asia. The statue was excavated at Gandhara, Pakistan, and dates to the 1st or 2nd century AD. Context Some of the standing Buddhas (such as the example pictured) were sculpted using the specific Greek technique of making the hands and sometimes the feet in marble to increase the realistic effect, and the rest of the body in another material. Alfred Charles Auguste Foucher especially considered Hellenistic free-standing Buddhas as \\"the most beautiful, and probably the most ancient of the Buddhas\\", assigning them to the 1st century BC, and making them the starting point of the anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha (The Buddhist art of Gandhara, Marshall, p. 101). Development Face of the statue, from 3 angles. Base of the statue. Standing Buddha, National Museum, New Delhi. Hand detail. From another direction, Chinese historical sources and mural paintings in the Tarim Basin city of Dunhuang accurately describe the travels of the explorer and ambassador Zhang Qian to Central Asia as far as Bactria around 130 BC, and the same murals describe the Emperor Han Wudi (156‚Äì87 BC) worshiping Buddhist statues, explaining them as \\"golden men brought in 120 BC by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads.\\" Although there is no other mention of Han Wudi worshiping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature, the murals would suggest that statues of the Buddha were already in existence during the 2nd century BC, connecting them directly to the time of the Indo- Greeks. Later, the Chinese historical chronicle Book of the Later Han describes the enquiry about Buddhism made around 67 AD by the emperor Emperor Ming (58‚Äì75 AD). He sent an envoy to the Yuezhi in northwestern India, who brought back paintings and statues of the Buddha, confirming their existence before that date: :\\"The Emperor, to discover the true doctrine, sent an envoy to Tianzhu (Northwestern India) to inquire about the Buddha's doctrine, after which paintings and statues [of the Buddha] appeared in the Middle Kingdom.\\" (Hou Hanshu, trans. John Hill) An Indo-Chinese tradition also explains that Nagasena, also known as the Indo-Greek King Menander's Buddhist teacher, created in 43 BC in the city of Pataliputra a statue of the Buddha, the Emerald Buddha, which was later brought to Thailand.

History An original construction permit for a low-power television station was granted on June 14, 1995 to Bruce Merrill, a pioneer in cable television service and cable television equipment manufacturing. The station was originally to broadcast as K69HL on UHF channel 69 from Mingus Mountain between Prescott Valley and Jerome, Arizona, but shortly afterward, the FCC granted the station authorization to move to UHF channel 28 with callsign K28FF, and to move the transmitter to Tower Mountain in the Bradshaw Mountains southeast of Prescott. The station licensed its modifications on December 23, 1997. In February 2000, Merrill sold the station to Tiger Eye Broadcasting Corp. of Miramar, Florida. At some point, the station went silent. In February 2005, Tiger Eye agreed to sell K28FF to Una Vez Mas. The FCC approved the transaction in May 2005, and the sale was consummated in April 2006. The FCC granted Tiger Eye a construction permit in June 2005 to move the station's transmitter location to the White Tank Mountains to the northwest of Phoenix to serve the rapidly growing Northwest Valley cities, but the facilities were never built. Una Vez Mas changed the stations call letters to KQBN-LP in November 2005, and in October 2006, KQBN-LP moved to a new transmitter site in the Bradshaw Mountains not far from the original licensed site and returned to air, rebroadcasting KNAZ-TV from Flagstaff.

An aggregate of Indigenous women's organizations from across the country, NWAC was founded on the collective goal to enhance, promote, and foster the social, economic, cultural and political well-being of Indigenous women within their respective communities and Canadian societies. Since 1974, NWAC has established governance structures, decision-making processes, financial policies and procedures, and networks. NWAC engages in national and international advocacy aimed at legislative and policy reforms that promote equality for Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people, including LGBTQ+ people. Through advocacy, policy, and legislative analysis, NWAC works to preserve Indigenous culture and advance the well-being of all Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people, as well as their families and communities. NWAC works on a variety of issues such as employment, labour and business, health, violence prevention and safety, justice and human rights, environment, early learning childcare and international affairs. __TOC__ History NWAC was founded in 1974 as an aggregate of 13 Aboriginal women's groups from coast to coast, with the goals of preserving Aboriginal culture, achieving equal opportunity for Aboriginal women, and having a role in shaping legislation relevant to Aboriginal women.Native Women's Association of Canada, \\"About Us,\\" URL accessed 15 July 2006. NWAC is led by a president and board of directors, who cooperate and exchange information with local organizations.Native Women's Association of Canada, \\"NWAC Structure URL accessed 15 July 2006. Meanwhile, the Board studies the actions of the President and its provincial/territorial member associations and makes recommendations.Native Women's Association of Canada, \\"Board of Directors,\\" URL accessed 15 July 2006. In 1992, when the Charlottetown Accord was being negotiated, the federal government included four Aboriginal groups in negotiations and gave them money. NWAC, which was not included, alleged the four groups primarily represented Aboriginal men and launched a court challenge for representation, claiming to have been denied rights to freedom of expression under section 2 and sexual equality under section 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This claim is known as the case of Native Women's Association of Canada v. Canada. It took place in 1994. NWAC reproached the federal government for not promoting gender equality. By being excluded from the Charlottetown Accord, NWAC has hence been excluded from constitutional negotiations. It maintained that the Aboriginal right to self-governance was not only the choice of the Aboriginal men but also the choice of Aboriginal women. Eventually, the Supreme Court of Canada supported the Federal Court and NWAC was excluded from the negotiations. In 2004, the Women's Court of Canada, a group of feminist / equality 'Charter' activists, lawyers, and academics, reconsidered the case of Native Women's Association of Canada v. Canada. The WCC remembered that Aboriginal women were historically equal in decisions. They also reproached the \\"patriarchal structure and discrimination\\" (reference: The Court) of the Canadian law. The Women's Court of Canada maintained that the federal government failed to include Aboriginal women in constitutional decisions, or at least Aboriginal women's interests. Because of this failure, the WCC announced that the federal government violated Aboriginal women's rights. Past PresidentsIn 2004 Beverley Jacobs was elected President.

It was created in 2005 and is run by Indigenous women. The aim of SIS is to drive research and raise awareness on the issue of violence and victimization against Aboriginal women in Canada. The federal government having decided to stop funding the SIS campaign in 2010, the campaign ended in the same year. Corbiere Lavell, one of NWAC's former presidents, said to the Aboriginal Multi-Media Society of Alberta (AMMSA): \\"This message is not simply about funding, but about engaging the people impacted by violence against Aboriginal women and more specifically, creating the opportunity for families who lost loved ones to have their voices heard,\\" From 2005 to 2010, Sisters in Spirit documented 582 cases of missing and/or murdered Indigenous women and girls over a span of twenty years. The purpose of the Sisters in Spirit Vigils is to both provide support to the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women, and to raise awareness of the nationwide issue. These vigils were part of the Sisters in Spirit Initiative that conducted a five-year research and education and policy initiative to ‚Äúaddress the root causes, circumstances and trends‚Äù of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. The movement began in 2006 when Bridget Tolley asked that a vigil be held on the steps of Parliament Hill to honour her mother, Gladys, who was killed in 2001 in Maniwaki, Quebec and over 500 missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls across Canada. NWAC worked with Tolley to organize the event on October 4, that had a turnout of over 100 people. The SIS vigils can take the form of rallies, community feasts or a moment of silence. The number of vigils to take place on October 4 has grown from 11 in 2006 to 216 by 2014. These vigils involve the families directly affected, Indigenous community members, and concerned non-Indigenous citizens. The NWAC Community Resource Guide outlines the importance of involvement from men, youth, and even the media at the vigils, and to also respect the protocol of the territory it is to take place on. * October 4 More than an event, October 4 is a movement seeking for social changes.

NWAC has released report cards evaluating the Inquiry's progress and activities. NWAC released the first report card in December 2016 stating that National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls do not have fully functional body since it is created in September 2016. NWAC also called for transparency, communication, and a process that is trauma-informed and culturally sensitive. Their second report was released in April 2017. it identified areas where this Inquiry has failed and areas that needed more attention. The report states that a lack of informative, transparent and accountable communication left many families and communities frustrated. In the spent of six months after the creation of the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, the inquiry provides too little information on its process. The report also states that ‚Äúit is unclear what opportunities are available and whether all families that wish to will be able to share their experiences‚Äù * Fact sheets On its website, NWAC also provides fact sheets with statistics and research on different themes of the issue, such as root causes of violence against Indigenous women. These sheets are made to raise awareness and try to underline the importance of the issue using facts. Controversy Beginning in May 2018, NWAC has faced numerous complaints regarding its working environments and treatment of staff. Staff have cited toxic work environments, concerns with upper management and the direction of the organization. Lynne Groulx, NWAC's CEO, has denied all allegations and knowledge of allegations, despite evidence that Groulx was aware of issues as early as September 2018. Since voicing concerns for staff, Francyne Joe, NWAC's President, was suspended and subsequently replaced by Lorraine Whitman References External links Native Women's Association of Canada website Category:Organizations established in 1974 Category:Indigenous rights organizations in North America Category:Women's organizations based in Canada Category:First Nations organizations Category:1974 establishments in Canada ","title":"Native Women's Association of Canada"},{"id":"5981541","title":"List of lighthouses in Oregon"},{"id":"5981548","text":"Acqua Panna is an Italian brand of bottled water and one of the world's largest bottled water brands.

Bussey later served as an Army officer in the Korean war. On July 20, 1950, Bussey was returning to his 77th Engineer Combat Company with mail from the states for one of his platoons, when he came across a dozen \\"lollygagagging\\" (resting) army truck drivers.

The enemy unit was destroyed. Bussey's group was given credit for killing 258 enemy soldiers in the battle. A day after United States forces occupied Yechon, an Associated Press reporter filed a story about the entire battle and said it was \\"the first sizable ground victory in the Korean war\\". Bussey stated that he was denied the Medal of Honor in the battle because a racist white officer, Lt. Col. John T.

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Plagopterus. Description The woundfin is a small slender, silvery minnow, with a flattened head and belly, long snout, leathery skin, and no scales. There are barbels on the corners of its lips, and its common name likely comes from the first spinous ray of its dorsal fin, which is sharp-pointed. Its maximum length is rarely more than 7.5 cm (3 in).\\"Plagopterus argentissimus\\". Arizona Game and Fish Department. 2001. Retrieved on July 16, 2006. It can be distinguished from spikedace and spinedace by presence of barbels. Distribution Historically, the woundfin occupied much of the lower Colorado River basin, including two tributaries, the Virgin River and part of the Gila River; however, habitat destruction through dams and water development has led to its extirpation from these regions. In addition, several introduced species, most notably the red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) have contributed to a decrease in the woundfin's Virgin River population. The woundfin is currently federally listed as an endangered species, while the United States Fish and Wildlife Service lists the population status as \\"declining.\\"  Habitat  The woundfin tolerates highly mineralized, turbid waters. It is typically found in warm, swift streams of high turbidity, preferring a stream speed of one to two feet per second and a depth of eight to eighteen inches. Woundfin lives in part of salty streams, avoiding clear waters and rarely can be found in quieter pools.  Food  The woundfin is omnivorous, and depending on availability will feed on detritus, algae, seeds, and aquatic insects and their larvae.\\"Plagopterus argentissimus.\\" NatureServe. June 9, 2006 version. Retrieved on July 16, 2006.  Conservation status  Historically, the woundfin also occupied the lower Colorado River from the Virgin to Yuma, Arizona, and the Gila River from Yuma to its confluence with the Salt River, but habitat destruction through water development (including eight major dams which alter flow) and the introduction of several species (particularly the red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis), which competes for food and is known to prey upon the woundfin's eggs and young\\"Designation of Critical Habitat for the Woundfin and Virgin River Chub.\\" Federal Register. January 26, 2006 edition.. Retrieved on July 23, 2006.) have led to its extirpation in these regions as well as a decline in population in the Virgin River. Since 1970, the woundfin has been listed as an endangered species. Other listings include \\"Vulnerable\\" on the IUCN Red List and \\"Critically Imperiled\\" (the most critical classification) by NatureServe. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service lists the population status as \\"declining.\\" The Dexter National Fish Hatchery in Dexter, New Mexico studies the woundfin in an effort to help conserve the species, and has successfully spawned the fish in captivity. However, efforts to transplant the species into other rivers and creeks have failed due to reproduction not taking place.Endangered Species Protection Program. United States Environmental Protection Agency. Updated May 2, 2006. Retrieved on July 16, 2006. On July 11, 2007, approximately 50 woundfin were released into the Hassayampa River near Wickenburg, Arizona. The hatchery-raised fish were from wild Virgin River stock. The only wild population of the species is in the Virgin River. An aggressive program to eradicate red shiner from the Virgin River in Utah has all but removed red shiner from reaches previously dominated by red shiner. Fish barriers have been erected to prevent re-colonization by red shiner, and has allowed the reintroduction of hatchery raised woundfin. Several thousand of hatchery-raised woundfin were released in the fall of 2007 and 2008. With red shiner no longer a threat, low flows and high temperatures are the biggest threats still facing wounfin. Another minnow, the Virgin River chub (Gila seminuda), has much of the same range as the woundfin and thus faces the same threats of extinction, particularly competition from the red shiner and a decrease in water quality as the result of agricultural runoff.

It can be found in mountain areas at altitudes of up to 3600 meters. Description Aculepeira ceropegia presents a marked sexual dimorphism. These spiders can reach a length of in males, of in females. They are easy to identify due to their unique abdominal marking in the form of an oak leaf. The head is covered by a grayish-brown hairs, chelicerae are light brown and legs are dark ringed. The abdomen is elongated and oval- shaped.AraneaeCommanster Biology Comparison between the female (right) and the male (left) Adults are visible from May to September. Early in the summer the oak spiders are sexually mature. Before mating, the male produces a sperm supply, that is finally transferred during mating to the female epigynum. The mating occurs during the summer, while the egg laying is done in early autumn. Eggs are usually deposited on the bark of a tree.Natur-in-nrw These orb- weaving spiders usually build a spiral vertical web close to the ground between herbaceous plants or on bushes at about 0.5-1.5 meters above ground level. They remain motionless for a long time with head down, waiting for prey. They inject venom in their victims with chelicerae. This venom paralyzes the preys and causes the external digestion with the incorporated gastric juices. Name Ceropegia is also a genus of succulent plants with about 200 species.

Overview The poem consists of approximately 958 lines of verse in 8 syllable rhymed couplets. The work is in the same poetic form as the majority of medieval French romans, although significantly shorter than the romances of Chr√©tien de Troyes). The work has come down to us in 20 manuscripts, though manuscripts C and G are the ones most commonly referred to, with the Folio Classiques edition using the former, which has 958 lines, and the Livre de Poche edition using the latter of 965 verses. The oldest extant version was written in the late 13th Century, in approximately 1288, and the presumed date for the composition of the work is the first half of that century. Some critics believe that the romance (other than the ending) is a roman √† clef and that elements are based on true events. The Ch√¢telaine de Vergy was apparently very popular in courtly circles. There exists as well a 15th-century prose version of the tale, and the plot was reused by Marguerite de Navarre in one of her Heptameron short stories (tale LXX). There are also multiple examples of the tale being portrayed in art, including various chests depicting scenes from the poem. Whether or not the text is part of the Courtly Love tradition has been widely debated, especially given Gaston de Paris and C.S. Lewis' definitions of the concept. Plot The Ch√¢telaine de Vergy tells the story of an unnamed knight in the service of the Duke of Burgundy who is the lover of the Ch√¢telaine of Vergy, the Duke's niece. The Ch√¢telaine has accepted this knight's love on one condition: that he must keep their relationship secret from everyone, and that when he comes to visit her, he must wait for her little dog to come out to him in the garden, which signals that she is alone and the knight may come see her. When the Duchess of Burgundy falls in love with the knight, he is forced to spurn her advances, citing his loyalty to the Duke and his love for another. In her anger, the duchess then tells her husband that the knight is unfaithful and has tried to seduce her, and the Duke accuses the knight of treachery. To save his honor, and to avoid being exiled (and thus forced to distance himself from his mistress), the knight, once the lord has promised to keep his secret, reveals to his lord where his heart truly lies, thus violating his promise to his mistress. The Duke reveals the truth of the knight's love to his wife, trusting her to keep the secret; but, at the feast of Pentecoste, the Duchess makes a cruel inside joke to the Ch√¢telaine about her lover and her \\"well-trained dog\\". The Ch√¢telaine realizes her lover has not kept his promise and she dies in despair. The knight discovers her body and kills himself.

Anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defense countermeasures can be categorized in a variety of ways, such as whether something is attacked or just confounded (i.e., whether the defender is attacked, whether the defender's ABM defense is attacked, or whether the defenders ABM system is confounded). They can be categorized by the type of ABM system they are to operate against. Finally, they can be categorized by which part of a ballistic missile's flight they are active (boost, bus, midcourse, or terminal phases). Attacking Countermeasures =Countermeasures Attacking the Defender= The simplest countermeasure to an ABM defense is to simply increase the size of the attack. This can be done by adding more ICBMs, by increasing the number of warheads delivered by each ICBM using MIRVs, by using SLBMs (which have a much shorter flight time and are thus difficult to destroy before the terminal phase), or by a heavier reliance on bombers and cruise missiles. =Countermeasures Attacking the Defense= These countermeasures include anti-satellite weapons, space weapons, and the launching of clouds of debris or projectiles in identical but counter-rotating orbits to a space-based defense. Confounding Countermeasures =Countermeasures Confounding the Defense= These countermeasures include using fast-burn boosters (which limit the time allowed for boost-phase intercept), light-weight ICBM skirts which limit the infrared signature of the booster (rocketry), use of decoys (e.g., lightweight mylar balloons which, until re-entry, will travel on an identical trajectory with the heavier warheads), use of Ablation materials or reflective coatings which limit the damage of directed energy weapons, launches of numerous harmless missiles early in an attack which might cause the defender reveal his defenses and expend valuable resources.

He was co-founder of MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA), an aerospace, information systems, and technology company. MacDonald served as the chancellor at the University of Northern British Columbia from 2010 through 2016. Early life and education Dr. MacDonald was born in Prince Rupert, British Columbia in 1936 to Neil and Alice MacDonald. His father was a Scottish immigrant and the captain of a BC Fisheries inspection vessel responsible for inspecting offshore fishing fleets throughout the north coast of BC. As a child, John was exposed to marine radio technologies at a neighbour's basement shop and discovered that he had a natural aptitude for the systems. By the age of 16 he was spending his summer months traveling up and down the coast fixing radios on the various fleets and tourist boats. Upon graduation from high school he moved to Vancouver, British Columbia to attend the school of Applied Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where he graduated with a bachelor's degree with honours in electrical engineering in 1959. Following his program at UBC he was accepted to the engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he earned a master's degree in 1961 and PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1964. Career As an undergraduate student at UBC, MacDonald spent his first three summers on a survey crew in Northern British Columbia. After his fourth and fifth years he worked as a student engineer at Atomic Energy of Canada Limited's Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, where he met his future wife, Alfredette, before moving to Boston to attend MIT. Upon graduation from MIT, where he had worked as a teaching assistant and discovered an aptitude for teaching, Dr MacDonald aspired to be a professor at the prestigious school. He was offered a position as an assistant professor at MIT and spent a year in this role when he was approached by UBC to join the staff of the Electrical Engineering department there, which he accepted. In 1965 he moved his young family back to Vancouver and started his career as a professor at UBC. By 1968 he was feeling the urge to try his hand at entrepreneurship and, with his friend and colleague, Vern Dettwiler, founded MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates in the basement of his Vancouver home in 1969 while continuing to serve as a professor at UBC. By 1973 the demands of his role at MDA caused him to leave the university and work full time with the fledgling technology company. He served as President and CEO of MDA until 1982, and as Chairman of the Board from 1982 to 1998. In addition to professorships in electrical engineering at MIT and UBC, Dr. MacDonald has served in an advisory capacity to the government and on the board of directors of numerous companies. In 2001 Dr. MacDonald co-founded Day4 Energy, a company that designed, manufactured and sold high performance solar electric modules. Day4 Energy went on to have one of the largest IPOs in Canada in 2007, at over $100 million and grew to almost 300 employees. In 2014 MacDonald retired from Day 4 Energy. Honours Dr. MacDonald was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in November 1988 and invested in April 1989. In 2008 Dr. MacDonald was awarded the British Columbia Technology Industry Association (BCTIA) Impact Award for Person of the Year in recognition of his contributions to science and the BC High Technology Industry. Day4 Energy also won the Impact Award for Emerging Company of the Year. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), founding Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering, and Fellow of the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute Dr. MacDonald passed away on 26 December 2019 at the age of 83.

He was a command pilot with more than 10,000 flying hours accumulated during his career. Early life Schoeffler was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he graduated from Lafayette High School in 1940 and attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then named the Southwestern Louisiana Institute. In 1942 he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps Reserve and began pilot training as an aviation cadet at Kelly Field, Texas. He received his pilot wings and commission as a second lieutenant in 1943. Military career =Early career= After serving in 1944 as a B-24 pilot in which he completed 30 missions for the Eighth Air Force in England, he returned to the United States. He became an instructor pilot at Bryan Army Air Base, Texas, and later at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. =Carswell Air Force Base= From 1948 to 1960, Schoeffler was stationed at Carswell Air Force Base, Texas. During the return of the 7th Bomb Wing from an Arctic bombing exercise then-Lt Col Schoeffler was involved in a crash at Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay on 12 February 1953 that claimed two lives. Flying through adverse weather Schoeffler was receiving directions for an instrument landing by a ground control operator who was actually monitoring another nearby B-36. Colonel Chadwell, the Wing Commander, was on board at the time. When the plane hit the ground the aft section broke off and the open end acted like a giant scoop packing in the snow. This incident would provide the basis for the 1955 film Strategic Air Command starring James Stewart which Schoeffler served as a consultant. He graduated from the Air Tactical School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. While at Carswell he also flew B-29 Superfortress and B-52 Stratofortress aircraft, and accumulated more than 5,000 hours flying the B-36. He served consecutively as a crewmember, flight standardization chief, squadron commander, and deputy commander for operations of the 7th Bombardment Wing. =1961-1975= Schoeffler graduated from the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in 1961. He next was assigned to the 379th Bombardment Wing, equipped with B-52H aircraft, at Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan, where he served as squadron commander, deputy commander for operations, and as a 40th Air Division operations staff officer. He returned to Barksdale Air Force Base in 1965, and was assigned as operations chief in the office of the inspector general, Second Air Force, and a year later became deputy commander for operations of the 2nd Bombardment Wing. He traveled to the Republic of Vietnam in 1967 as deputy chief of the Strategic Air Command advanced echelon at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. He flew combat missions in B-52 Stratofortress, KC-135, and UH-1 Iroquois aircraft. In 1968 he was transferred to Strategic Air Command headquarters as chief of the Contingency Division in the office of the deputy chief of staff, operations. In 1972 he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C., as chief of the Strategic Operations Division within the Directorate of Operations. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on April 2, 1973. He returned to SAC headquarters in 1974 to assume duties as director of operations and training. He retired in 1975.

Prehistoric Times  The earliest known settlements in Lebanon date back to earlier than 5000 BC. In Byblos, which is considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, archaeologists have discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and burial jars which are evidence of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 8,000 years ago.  Ancient Near East  =Bronze Age= The area now known as Lebanon first appeared in recorded history around 4000 BC as a group of coastal cities and a heavily forested hinterland. It was inhabited by the Canaanites, a Semitic people, whom the Greeks called \\"Phoenicians\\" because of the purple (phoinikies) dye they sold. These early inhabitants referred to themselves as \\"men of Sidon\\" or the like, according to their city of origin, and called the country \\"Lebanon.\\" Because of the nature of the country and its location, the Phoenicians turned to the sea, where they engaged in trade and navigation. Each of the coastal cities was an independent kingdom noted for the special activities of its inhabitants. Tyre and Sidon were important maritime and trade centers; Gubla (later known as Byblos; in Arabic, Jbeil) and Berytus (present-day Beirut) were trade and religious centers. Gubla was the first Phoenician city to trade actively with Egypt and the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BC), exporting cedar, olive oil, and wine, while importing gold and other products from the Nile Valley. Before the end of the 17th century BC, Lebanese-Egyptian relations were interrupted when the Hyksos, a nomadic Semitic people, conquered Egypt. After about three decades of Hyksos rule (1600-1570 BC), Ahmose I (1570-1545 BC), Theban prince, launched the Egyptian liberation war. Opposition to the Hyksos increased, reaching a peak during the reign of the pharaoh Thutmose III (1490-1436 BC), who invaded Syria, put an end to Hyksos domination, and incorporated Lebanon into the Egyptian Empire. Toward the end of the 14th century BC, the Egyptian Empire weakened, and Lebanon was able to regain its independence by the beginning of the 12th century BC. The subsequent three centuries were a period of prosperity and freedom from foreign control during which the earlier Phoenician invention of the alphabet facilitated communications and trade. The Phoenicians also excelled not only in producing textiles but also in carving ivory, in working with metal, and above all in making glass. Masters of the art of navigation, they founded colonies wherever they went in the Mediterranean Sea (specifically in Cyprus, Rhodes, Crete, and Carthage) and established trade routes to Europe and western Asia. These colonies and trade routes flourished until the invasion of the coastal areas by the Assyrians. =Assyrian rule= Assyrian rule (875-608 BE) deprived the Phoenician cities of their independence and prosperity and brought repeated, unsuccessful rebellions. In the middle of the 8th century BC, Tyre and Byblos rebelled, but the Assyrian ruler, Tiglath-Pileser III, subdued the rebels and imposed heavy tributes. Oppression continued unabated, and Tyre rebelled again, this time against Sargon II (722-705 BC), who successfully besieged the city in 721 BC and punished its population. During the 7th century BC, Sidon rebelled and was completely destroyed by Esarhaddon (681-668 BC); its inhabitants were enslaved. Esarhaddon built a new city on Sidon's ruins. By the end of the 7th century BC, the Assyrian Empire, weakened by the successive revolts, had been destroyed by the Median Empire. =Babylonian rule= As the Babylonians finally defeated the Assyrians at Carchemish, much of Lebanon was already in their hands, since much of it was seized from the collapsing Assyrian kingdom. In that time two Babylonian kings succeeded the throne, Nabopolassar who focused on ending Assyrian influence in the region, and his son Nebuchadnezzar II whose reign witnessed several regional rebellions, especially in Jerusalem. Revolts in Phoenician cities became more frequent during that period (685-636 BC, Tyre rebelled again and for thirteen years resisted a siege by the troops of Nebuchadnezzar 587-574 BC. After this long siege, the city capitulated; its king was dethroned, and its citizens were enslaved. =Achaemenid Empire= The Babylonian province of Phoenicia and its neighbors passed to Achaemenid rule with the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus the Great in 539/8 BC. The Syro- Phoenician coastal cities remained under Persian rule for the following two centuries. The Phoenician navy supported Persia during the Greco-Persian War (490-49 BC). But when the Phoenicians were overburdened with heavy tributes imposed by the successors of Darius I (521-485 BC), revolts and rebellions resumed in the Lebanese coastal cities. The Persian Empire, including the Phoenician province, eventually fell to Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia in 4th century BC. Main rulers under the Achaemenid Empire: *Eshmunazar II *Tabnit *Baalshillem II *Abdashtart I *Tennes File:Protome from Eshmun Sanctuary.jpgPersian style two-headed bull protome found in Sidon . Marble, 5th century BC. Image:Lycian sarcophagus.jpgThe Lycian sarcophagus of Sidon, 430-420 BC. Classical Antiquity =Macedonian rule= The Persian Empire eventually fell to Alexander the Great, king of Macedon. He attacked Asia Minor, defeated the Persian troops in 333 BC, and advanced toward the Lebanese coast. Initially the Phoenician cities made no attempt to resist, and they recognized his suzerainty. However, when Alexander tried to offer a sacrifice to Melqart, Tyre's god, the city resisted. Alexander besieged Tyre in retaliation in early 332 BC. After six months of resistance, the city fell, and its people were sold into slavery. Despite his early death in 323 BC, Alexander's conquest of the eastern Mediterranean Basin left a Greek imprint on the area. The Phoenicians, being a cosmopolitan people amenable to outside influences, adopted aspects of Greek civilization with ease. The Seleucid Dynasty After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his Macedonian generals. The eastern part‚ÄîPhoenicia, Asia Minor, northern Syria, and Mesopotamia fell to Seleucus I, founder of the Seleucid dynasty. The southern part of Syria and Egypt fell to Ptolemy, and the European part, including Macedonia, to Antigonus I. This settlement, however, failed to bring peace because Seleucus I and Ptolemy clashed repeatedly in the course of their ambitious efforts to share in Phoenician prosperity. A final victory of the Seleucids ended a forty-year period of conflict. =Roman rule= Greek and Latin on one of the tombs found in the Roman-Byzantine necropolis in Tyre. The last century of Seleucid rule was marked by disorder and dynastic struggles. These ended in 64 BC, when the Roman general Pompey added Seleucid Syria and Lebanon as a Roman province to the Roman Empire. Economic and intellectual activities flourished in Lebanon during the Pax Romana. The inhabitants of the principal Phoenician cities of Byblos, Sidon, and Tyre were granted Roman citizenship. These cities were centers of the pottery, glass, and purple dye industries; their harbors also served as warehouses for products imported from Syria, Persia, and India. They exported cedar, perfume, jewelry, wine, and fruit to Rome. Economic prosperity led to a revival in construction and urban development; temples and palaces were built throughout the country, as well as paved roads that linked the main cities like Heliopolis and Berytus. Indeed, starting in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE (reign of Augustus) and over a period of two centuries (reign of Philip the Arab), the Romans built a huge temple complex in Heliopolis (actual Baalbek) on a pre-existing tell consisting of three temples: Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus. On a nearby hill, they built a fourth temple dedicated to Mercury. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus (actual Beirut): the fifth Macedonian and the third Gallic.Roman Berytus: a colony of legionaries The city quickly became Romanized. Large public buildings and monuments were erected and Berytus enjoyed full status as a part of the empire.About Beirut and Downtown Beirut, DownTownBeirut.com. Retrieved November 17, 2007. Heliopolis Under the Romans, Berytus was enriched by the dynasty of Herod the Great, and was made a colonia, Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus, in 14 BC. Beirut's school of law was widely known at the time.Beirut, Britannica.com Two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught at the law school under the Severan emperors. Furthermore, The city of Heliopolis was made a colonia by Septimius Severus in 193 AD, having been part of the territory of Berytus on the Phoenician coast since 15 BC. Work on the religious complex there lasted over a century and a half and was never completed. The dedication of the present temple ruins, the largest religious building in the entire Roman empire, dates from the reign of Septimus Severus, whose coins first show the two temples. The great courts of approach were not finished before the reigns of Caracalla (211-217 CE) and Philip the Arab (244-249 CE). In commemoration of the dedication of the new sanctuaries, Severus conferred the rights of the ius Italicum on the city. Today, only six Corinthian columns remain standing of this huge Jupiter temple. Severus also separated the area of modern Lebanon and parts of Syria from the greater province of Syria Coele, and formed the new province of Phoenice. Upon the death of Theodosius I in 395 AD, the empire was divided in two: the eastern or Byzantine part with its capital at Constantinople, and the western part with its capital at Rome. Under the Byzantine Empire, intellectual and economic activities in Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon continued to flourish for more than a century. However, in the 6th century a series of earthquakes demolished the temples of Heliopolis and destroyed the Romanized city of Beirut, leveling its famous law school and killing nearly 30,000 inhabitants. To these natural disasters were added the abuses and corruptions prevailing at that time in the empire. Heavy tributes and religious dissension produced disorder and confusion. Furthermore, the ecumenical councils of the 5th and 6th centuries were unsuccessful in settling religious disagreements. This turbulent period weakened the empire and made it easy prey to the newly converted Muslim Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula.
